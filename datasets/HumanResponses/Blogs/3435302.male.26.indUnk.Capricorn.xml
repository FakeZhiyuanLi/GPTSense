      It's my last day at work! After 7 years with the company I'm heading off. Everything's sorted at work, all my 'files' have been copied to a hdd and taken home, god knows what I've forgotten....  The going away party/beer buffet is all organised too. Should be heaps of fun, I'm getting a really good turn out so far. I'll get heaps of photos and probably some video too and upload some somewhere and link them here. Stay tuned for more highly embarassing details.... My list of email addresses is pretty incomplete so if you didn't get an invite it's not because I don't love you it's just because my address book is out of date. If you'd like to come drop me a line ASAP because there's only a limited number of spaces and I guess it will have to be first come, first served.

      Well everyting's starting to come together for the big trip. All my visas are organised, 1/2 my toys are sold and the flights are all booked. Actually if anyone wants a 2002 Triumph Speed Triple give me a call ;-)

      I went back up Fromme mtn today and rode the same three tracks again (7th Secret, Espresso and Cripler). I'm starting to really have fun now. Rode the whole way on all three tracks (I walked a few of the sketchier switch backs and rocks faces etc last time) and even did most of the stunts. This northshore stuff is brilliant! Got to go, I'm starving.

      I went for another ride today with an Aussie from the hostel. Finally things started coming together. We did three tracks, all black diamond rated (i.e. harder than the nasty thing I crashed my brains out on) but I finally got my act sorted and started enjoying myself. For anyone that knows Canada (or cares for that matter) we did 7th Secret, Espresso and Crippler. I'm going up again tomorrow and can't wait to get back out there. Did heaps of log rides and a few pretty high and steep walkways and stuff. This is soooo much fun. I'm hooked!!

      Well I'm supposed to be going sky diving today but for the first day since I've been here the clouds have decended. They've delayed it from 10am to 1pm so I'll have to wait and see how things are looking then. More later, I'm off to try and get my mobile phone connected.

      Yep, I've gone and done it again. I bought myself some flats and shoes after my last ankle twisting episode so this time I've managed to f#ck my wrist up. I would have just dismissed it as a sprain but the injury was on the same wrist I broke a couple of years ago so I went to the horse-spittle to get it checked out. $430 later, that's not a misprint $430 for a consultation with a doctor! Thank god for health insurance. Anyway turns out everything looks fine and they even noticed that the scaphoid (sp?) is now nicely healed which is good to know.  Since there's not really any more upgrades I can do to protect my wrists I guess I'm going to have to gain some riding ability instead..... And before anyone asks yes I got video footage of this crash although it looks disappointingly piss weak. I'll have to wait and see how the wrist goes but hopefully I'll be back on the bike in a couple of days. The full face helmet did it's job too. I broke the peak which is a bugger but it's got some nice scratches on the mouth guard now to show that it's doing it's job.  It's not all bad news though. I met a girl in the waiting room at the hospital called Lucinda. She seems really nice and has offered to show me around Vancouver so that should be fun. More news as it comes to hand.  Speaking of hands mine's starting to ache so I'm giving up on this silly typing caper and going to bed. Keep the comments coming people's it makes things much more fun. As for you PF don't let Alzheimers get in the way and get yourself a username and password so you can make some contributions.

      I've been doing a heap of general wandering around Vancouver over the last few days while I'm waiting for my ankle to get better enough to go out and screw it up again. Taken a few photos with the video camera so now all I've got to do is get access to a computer with a usb port so I can upload them. Stanley park (north of the city) is really amazing. It's so different to the parks back home.  I'm heading out tomorrow to buy a set of flats and some new shoes to try to prevent a repeat performance of my first ride. Then it's off to the mountains to play again and see what happens. After asking around a bit I've come to the depressing conclusion that the track I was riding was one of the easiest around (I was right about it's rating but the tracks around here go from hard to insane). Time to step it up the riding a notch and hopefully I'll get the hang of these tracks. I'll take the camera with me tomorrow, at least the crash footage should be funny for Fuchsia Boy.....

      I mean I really, really, really suck!!!  Went for my first ride today and all I can say is HOLY SHIT!!! These tracks are about 50 times anything I've experienced in Oz. Within the first 100m or so I'd crashed about 4 times, totally blown all my confidance and was basically picking my way down. Trouble is these are really momentum/confidence type tracks where you need to keep some speed up to have a chance so it all went to hell. Lots of wheel eating rocks and roots so unless you've got enough speed up you keep stalling and bouncing off into trees. I'm suprised a little girl on a pink tricycle didn't pass me 1/2 way down actually. I guess I'm just lucky it was a school day ;-)  I did a bit better on the bottom half of the track and even managed to ride a very easy northshore rampy type thing (although in retrospect it could have been the access ramp to the local nursing home..... I'll have to go back and check). For anyone that actually knows the tracks around Grouse mtn I was riding Pipeline. It was rated as a blue square/black diamond (equivalent of red/black for the climbers out there) which was probably at least part of the problem. Maybe I should switch on at least a little bit of my brain next time.... When my ankle recovers enough to go riding again I'll try a straight blue square run and see how I go.  On that point has anyone else noticed that Time pedals aren't quite so good at releasing in a crash? I never got my feet caught in my 636's but my ankle injury came about after my left foot got stuck in the pedal and the bike twisted it at a wierd angle. If it had released it would have been an injury free run (apart from the pride). Maybe I should go back to Mr Shimano or even flats.  Other than that the bike certainly kicked arse. Stood up to all my abuse with no problems at all and I'm sure it was capable of way more than I was throwing at it. The knee/shin guards that you gave me Ace are legendary. They've know got some nice deep gouges in them to show that they've been doing their job. No footage yet, sorry people. I decided to leave the camera at home until I got my bearings a bit by I'll probably take it out next time.  Anyway I'd better go and get some dinner. More soon. BTW if someone wants to post a heads up to mtb-oz now that there's actually some bike content on here I would appreciate it.  Phil -sitting here with an ankle the size of a football

      Well I'm finally in Vancouver. I seriously never thought it would actually happen but I'm sitting in the backpackers as I type. Actually it turns out it's in a pretty dodgy neighbourhood which makes things kind of interesting when you walk out to go somewhere (25c peep shows anyone?) but I'm going to see how I go and I might cancel a week or two off my stay here and head up to Whistler or somewhere like that at some stage. I'll just have to see how I go. The bike's all assembled and it survived the trip mostly unscathed. I've met another Aussie with a Canondale Gemini already and he's going to take me out and show me the trails tomorrow so I'll see how I go. I'm not sure if I'll take the camera along or not, I might wait until I know what I'm in for a bit better.  Anyway I'm stuffed and according to the clock on this computer it's 6:32am so I really should head off to bed (it's actually only 11 but that's late enough). I'll write more soon and thanks for the comments Michael and Heath. Come on the rest of you slackers :-)

      Firstly make sure you can't remember what a dime is much less be able to identify a quater in under 20 seconds. Standing in a queue at the shops staring at the coins in your had is a fantastic way to blend right in. It's only improved upon by giving the sales person the totally wrong money when you finally get to the front of the queue..... Fahn Americans and their weird money, you'd think they'd conform with Australia like everyone else should.  Secondly repeatedly walk to the right hand side of the car you're about to drive. Occasionally driving down the left hand side of the road helps no end too.  Thirdly order a desert of the menu when the waiter asks if you'd like any drinks. Well it looked like a drink! Honest!!!  As a final point I don't have a bloody accent. All the rest of the people on Hawaii (apart from any other visiting Aussies of course) do. At least all of the comments were saying it was a cool accent and they all recognised it as Australian which suprised me.  As I briefly mentioned in the previous post Hawaii was really stunning. I went up Diamond head one morning and the view is just staggering. All the running around plus a bit Pauly lag (not jet lag, it's all Pauly's fault damn it!) meant I didn't get quite as much done as I'd originally hoped but it was still an amazing experience. Unfortunately Hanoma (sp?) bay was closed on Tuesdays (which just happened to be when I tried to go there) but I've heard the fish are really incredible. I guess I've got a good excuse to go back now. Did a run around some of the famous beaches, bought an obnoxious Hawaiian shirt and had a few amazing meals and it was time to go.... To CANADA!!!!

      Well Sydney was certainly...... interesting. And.... educational. I actually had a really good time Pauly and Catrina were really cool to hang around with. After dealing with the suitcase eating turn stiles at Sydney railway station I had a pretty cruisey first day or so with Pauly just replacing the previously mentioned broken castors and generally waiting for my brain to catch up with the rest of me. I think it was nearly there when I left for Oahu so hopefully someone will give it directions to Canada....  On the Saturday night we went out to a rave. Was a first and pretty cool. Although it just seemed like a dance club but was awesome none the less. I borrowed Pauly's Grover pants for the evening which got a few comments (mostly from guys unfortunately). Sunday night was certainly an experience and it was cool to catch up with a few of Pauly's and Cat's friends. We got home fairly early which was nice of Pauly and Cat. I hope I didn't drag you guys away from your friends.  We got to the airport in heaps of time the next morning (which came in handy when it turned out that the maximum weight for a bike box is 32kg not 34kg and mine weighed 37kg. I'm not sure how I crammed 5kg more into my main suitcase but I got it in there somehow. Time to go shopping for a bigger suitcase me thinks. Actually I'm considering a bike bag now too. Packing the bike in that box is just too much of a pain in the arse and I'm going to have to do it a fair bit more to get it around the place in Canada. Anyway more in the next post.

      Well Hawaii has been really amazing. I only got a fraction of the things I had planned done but I think that's always the case when you're on holidays. Stunning views (and some quite nice mountains too.....) and perfect weather. I'll post more when I've got more time in Canada but until then POST A COMMENT YOU SLACKERS!!!! After one initial comment by Michael I haven't seen a thing. It only takes about 20 seconds to set up a Blogg account and no matter where I move the blogg to it's going to require some kind of sign in to contribute. Come on, let me know what you think. Any sick and twisted requests? I know you'll have a couple Ace.... More soon.

      If anyone feels like signing up for a blogg account so they can post comments it would make the whole thing a bit more interesting too. Go on, it's only a one minute job then you can post comments any time and the whole thing will become a bit more interactive.

      Well I'm finally in Sydney. What a bloody nightmare but it's mostly over now and I haven't thought of anything too major that I've forgotten...... Yet. This is probably going to be a long and rambling post but if you can be bothered wading through it all there might be a few few vaguely amusing bits in there somewhere.  It all started going to hell a few days ago. The realisation was slowly dawning on me that I'd left everything WAY too late. As always seems to happen in these situations everything started taking between three and five times as long as it otherwise should. Anyway to cut a long storyfshort I was still paking on Friday morning at 4am (the flight was leaving at 3:10pm that afternoon). After a certain amount of total chaos and me lumping my friends with far too much crap to deal with on my behalf (Sorry and thanks Alex, Anna, mum, Ashley) I actually managed to get to the airport just as my flight was being called to the front of the queue. Despite being the first person called to check in the flight was actually listed as closed as I was boarding. Far too close!  I nearly forgot to mention the reason for the title too. The bastards at the security check at check in pinched a brand new, high quality, very large, very expensive roll of gaffer tape off me and threw it in the bin! Not happy. What am I going to do? Threaten to pull out the pilots leg hairs if he doesn't do what I tell him? Fashion an ICBM out of duct tape and plastic cutlery?  The flight to Sydney had all the usual hold ups but was mostly uneventful. Just one thing though. Is it just me or does the luggage on planes defy the laws of physics? Either that or the baggage handlers just hate me for some reason. Somehow despite my bags being last onto the plane they always seem to be nearly last off. For that matter has anyone every had their bags come off first or are those people some figment of our collective immaginations or members of some upper class sect or something?  I caught the air train from the airport to central where I was meeting up with the friend I'm staying with for the weekend. Against all preconceptions Sydney people turned out to be very helpful and offered me a hand on a number of occasions, of course that could be due to the fact my bag almost fell under the train while I was attempting to drag my bike off..... Also thanks Adrian for convincing me to fit castors to my bike box. The only problem was I spent too much too much time reinforcing the bike box and not enough finding the best castors. Two of the bloody things broke on the way back to Pauly's place but I've not got a stronger set sitting in the room waiting to be fitted so hopefully problem solved.  Only two days until I fly out now. The reality of it all is sort of coming and going in waves. At the moment it just feels like I'm hanging out at a friends place for the weekend or something but I suspect it will all hit home when I'm on the plane. I'll try to post again soon.  Interesting facts. -Furbies are not allowed to be used at any time during flights?!?! -George W has something against gaffer tape (or maybe he's just trying to pinch it off everyone, bloody tight arse....) -The signage in Sydney train stations sucks. I think I did about three laps of the whole station only to end up about 50m from where I started

      My poor baby's off to Vancouver without me! After sweating and swearing as I dragged the bloody bike box up into the old town area of Quebec city I finally got sick of it. Especially when I rode the bloody thing once on Saturday and did my ankle in again. Anyway I've shipped the Bullit back to Vancouver by bus without me. Quite a good plan I thought. It costs the same as the excess baggage charge on the airlines and means I don't have to worry about it (although I was watching the bus baggage handlers on the way here and got a bit stressed, 3m drops are nothing compared to these guys) until I get back to Vancouver.  I've learned a whole lot of lessons about travelling&nbsp;in the last few weeks but I think I'm starting to figure it out now. Lots less stuff and backpacks are the way to go. I'm going to ship a large box of stuff home and I haven't even really bought anything yet! Time to thin things out a bit.  I'm in Halifax, Nova Scotia now and just trying to plan my trip to Cape Bretton via the Cabbot trail. It's supposed to be really amazing so I'll get heaps of photos and upload them as soon as I can. I've got lots already (man it's good to have a decent sized memory stick finally) and I'll try to upload them soon.  Found a pub that sells beef stew for $5.50 too so it's going to be hard to top that for dinner. Speaking of dinner I'd better go and get some. More soon.

      Well the fahn rain didn't hold off..... Mt Ste Anne was very wet, slushy and slippery but the riding was fun anyway. They've got some awesome wooden ramp/jump type things. One of them was even set up as a baby gap jump which I managed to completely stuff up but the bike saved my arse and I managed to ride it out anyway. The guys I was riding with were really good value. Lots of jokes about the aussie accent but they shut up for a bit when I threw a few "Y'alls" out there.... Had a fun night of beer and pizza with them and partners too. &nbsp; In typical Phil style I crashed on about the third run and managed to bugger up my left ankle yet again. I kept riding for the rest of the day but soggy muddy shorts combined with a sore ankle put me off riding the next day so I just hung out and watched the Canadian national downhill instead. &nbsp; Other than that the backpackers at Quebec city seems to be the only one in Canada that doesn't offer storage so I'm in the process of trying to find somewhere else to leave the bike while I go to Nova Scotia. Hopefully I'll figure something out otherwise the bike's going with me I guess.

      I'm finally an authentic backpacker. I went out today and after doing what felt like about three laps of the city I finally bought a backpack. It's a North Face Badlands so at least it sounds tough even if I'm not..... I'm hoping my new packing arrangements will make things a lot easier but I'm going to find out tomorrow. Not much more news but I'm off to the bus station in a minute to buy my ticket to Quebec. Mt Ste Anne here I come! Now I've just got to hope that this fahn rain holds off.

      Well I've got a few things worked out and now I've got a direction again I'm feeling much more positive. I'm taking the bike with me up to Quebec city on Friday and spending the weekend riding with Brian (the guy that sold me the bike). Should be an awesome weekend playing on the world cup downhill track among others. Also he's got a helmet camera too so hopefully we'll get some great footage of each other.  After that I'm ditching the bike in Quebec. The backpackers will store things for you for $1/day so I'm buying a backpack, ditching the bike and going proper backpacking for three weeks. The current plan is to catch the bus to Halifax, Nova Scotia then bus or bum rides around the area. I've heard it's really beautiful and I'm really looking forward to getting away from the cities, tourist routes etc. The plan is to find a really nice quiet spot and just spend a week or two there enjoying nature and unwinding. Then it's back to Quebec to pick up the bike and on to Toronto.  I've got an email from an old school friend who I haven't met in years (James Daracott for those that know him) and we've arranged to meet up at (or around) Toronto and go to Niagra falls together. Should be heaps of fun and I'll finally have someone else to hold the camera so I can get in some of my own shots. I've done a couple already but my head looks too big at arms length (yeah, even bigger than normal smart arses). I'm thinking about one of those mini tripods so I can set the camera up and get in a few more of the photos. Combined with the remote that came with the camera it should be pretty easy.  Not much more news at this stage. I spent today shopping for backpacks and checking out a few more of the history museums around the place. I also got totally ripped off for dinner, very average ham and cheese crepe at a very non-average price. Ah well, the Lonely Planet warned me the old port area was bad for that. Speaking of which it's one of the few things the Lonely Planet has got right so far. After everyone raving about how good it is mine has proved to be fahn inaccurate so far. Ah well, letters will be written. Also on the topic of lonely Planets, Heath yours should be back in Brisbane around now. My flatmate assumed it was mine because I forgot to give it back to you in the rush and it went for a trip to Warwick. Anyway I think it's back in Brisbane now so if you want to arrange to pick it up drop me an email and we'll work out the details.  That's all for now. I'm going to get ready before going out to the international fireworks competition. Should be pretty cool, check back for details and probably some photos too.

      And I'm modest too :-)  The ability to cause car crashes that is. I was stopped on the John Le Cartier bridge yesterday and a minibus/van type thingy ran into the back of a car. And it was all because of me. Of course the fact that there was a policeman stopped in his car in the middle of the bridge trying to talk me out of committing suicide may have had something to do with it. It's all true! Honest! Well mostly anyway. I was walking over the John Le Cartier bridge yesterday and stopped to check out the local amusement park (Le Ronde) when a police officer pulled up on the road to check if I was OK (apparently they get a lot of suicides off the bridge), I'd just turned around to say "Yeah, fine thanks, I'm just looking at the amusement park." when *screeeeeetch* *CRUNCH!!!*  Other than that I had a pretty good day. Checked out the Biosphere (it's impressiveness is only matched by it's pointlessness) and also Settlement 67 which is a very cool architectural experiment from the time of the Olympics. Lots more photos but I'm not sure if they'll all fit on my Yahoo site, I'll have to check out the limits.  My knees are just about better, Mt Ste Anne is drawing nearer and I can't wait. Brian is bringing his helmet camera with him too so I might even get some footage of my uncoordinated riding style for you all to laugh at. More wandering around the city today and I've got to arrange my trip to Quebec city too. Bloody bike is restricting the options somewhat but damn it's going to be worth it when I get to Mt Ste Anne.

      Well I've landed in Montreal. (I hate this freaking keyboard too. The bloody shift key is in a slightly different spot or something and I keep getting forward slashes instead of shifts. Sorry, I just had to rant to someone....)  Off to my usual flying start I managed to pull the over head light out of the bus thinking it was the a/c duct. Ah well, it clipped back in OK and I don't think anyone saw me.  Other than that the only other comments so far are a huge whinge about how much my knees are hurting after my last crash. I think I've just got really deep bruising or something but they're bloody sore all the time. It makes walking around to check out the sites a real pain in the arse (I'll avoid the obvious pun...).  Also I'm sick to the back teeth of traveling with a bike already. I don't know if there's any way around it or if you just get used to it or something but dragging that f%cking thing around everywhere is really getting on my nerves. That and the fact it takes me nearly half a day to pack the bloody thing each time I want to take it somewhere.... I'm just about ready to give up on this mtbing caper and just enjoy Canada without the bike. I'm sure I'll feel otherwise after a few days riding Mt Ste Anne though. I'll keep you informed.  I now have a 256mb memory card for my camera too so taking photos is going to be much easier. Instead of only being able to fit 14 I can fit about 420.  On a final note I'm starting to realise how much of a full on experience going to a non-English speaking country would be. I guess I've done it in a sort of 1/2 baked way because a lot of the people in Montreal speak English but even ordering a sandwich at lunch was a challenge. I ended up ordering a connoisseur simply because it was the only one I was confident of pronouncing in a vaguely recognisable way....  Time to go out and see the sites and take some photos for as long as my knees will hold out. Reading back through that it all sounds pretty down. I guess I'm just a bit tired a jet lagged. More upbeat news to follow soon.

      I got another room mate after a bit of time on my own the other day. A Mexican called Arron (sp?). Anyway we went out and checked out a few more sites around the place. We went to the Capilano suspension bridge. A bit of a rip off at $20 and very touristy but interesting and kind of fun none the less. They've added a lot of 'attractions' which I personally think is a shame. If they'd just had the bridge and related stuff and charged a quater of the price I would have thought it was pretty good. As it is I'd say to anyone else coming here don't bother. You can go to the Lynn Canion bridge which is very similar and only slightly smaller for nothing. I haven't got there yet but I've heard it's a lot less developed too and has some nice walks in the area as well.  I've done another couple of runs up Grouse mtn too. On the last one I met this guy called Chris on an RM7 and his wife (whose name I've managed to forget despite hearing it about 20 times) on an XC hard tail of some description. I followed them down Upper Oil Can which is pretty fun and has an amazing log ride. It's actually about three log rides joined together that sort of zig zag around. I did 2/3 of it but skipped the middle log which was the highest and narrowest. I'm going to have to go back and conquer it though. After that we did Ladies Only which is a double black run. Heaps of fun and having someone better to follow down made a huge difference. I honestly had no idea that you could roll down stuff as steep as I was following this guy down. I actually lent so far back I go my arse with the back tyre at one point. Awesome fun and I got through the whole lot crash free but.... We got to the bottom and Chris and partner had to head off to pick up the kids from the baby sitter so I headed up by myself. I decided to do Espresso and Lower Crippler because I couldn't be bothered riding up to the higher tracks again. I was having a ball and cleared nearly all of the stunts on Espresso including doing a really narrow skinny 1st attempt. Then I tried the hard line down a rock face I had been avoiding. The front dug in and I went splat. No serious damage to me or the bike although that fahn wireless speedo copped it again. I think those things are just too vulnerable. Anyway both my knees are kind of stuffed despite wearing armour so I've been off the bike again for a couple of days. I'm starting to feel better again already though so I'll probably get back up there on Friday.  I'd better get going but check back soon for more.

      Well I finally went skydiving the other day. It was definitely a great experience. Not quite the adrenaline rush I was expecting which I guess was kind of dissapointing but heaps of fun anyway. I lashed out and bought a video of it too so you'll all get to see how not scared I was.... Second thoughts maybe I shouldn't mention the video. The feeling as you first roll out of the plane is just brilliant, just totally letting go I guess. I'm up for a bungee jump now.  Since everyone keeps asking I thought I'd better give a quick Lucinda update too. So far it's turned into a bit of a non-event. After leaving a message for her on voicemail ages ago (the day after we met) I just keep getting her voice mail again but I can't even leave a message becuase it's full. I was planning on sending an sms when I got my mobile working but what a saga that's turned into.... Anyway it looks like I'll have a mobile online in about 3 days or so so we'll see what happens then.  Other than that I've been doing more site seeing that bike riding lately. I'm going to try to make it up to the northshore again today though and I'll even take the video camera with me again. Trying to get the photos online has been another saga but hopefully I'll have something for you soon. I might even drag someone up Grouse mtn with me and see if I can get some photos of the mtbing that I can upload more easily than video.  OK it's done. Photos at http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/sprint_st955/album?.dir=/2089 Anyway I'd better get going, I think my credit is about to run out. Check back for more updates soon.

      Well I'm heading back west soon so I thought I'd better do at least one more post first. I'm thinking of starting a new section on the blog so in that vein:  Phil's weekly rant For my inaugural rant I'd like to pick on restaurant/café staff. Why is it that when you're standing back from the counter reading the menu/black board they feel the need to ask you what you want? Isn't it obvious from the fact that you're deliberately standing back from the counter that you're still considering what to order? All it does with me is make me want to leave because I feel uncomfortable standing there reading with them watching your every move......  Anyway back to normal programming now. Well as normal as I get anyway. More rants this time. I tried to go to an Indian restaurant yesterday that was recommended in the Lonely Planet (no, this isn't a rant about the Lonely Planet for a change....). Anyway it was a fair way out of town so I caught the subway (1). When I got off the subway it had started raining lightly so I was glad when I spotted a map in a bus stop pretty much right at the exit from the subway. It was turned out so that it lined up with the streets as you faced them and north was pointing off at some funny angle. All well and good except it turns out it was rotated 180deg. from where it should have been AND the subway station was shown on the wrong side of the nearest cross road. So I happily took off in exactly the wrong direction in the rain looking for the restaurant. Walked about six freaking blocks before I decided something was wrong and had to walk all the way back then another 4ish blocks in the other direction! Not happy Jan!! Is it really that hard to get maps at least basically accurate?  Saw an interesting thing yesterday too. This kind of weedy looking hippy type wearing a "Fuck off Nazi punks" t-shirt with a big swastika with a circle with a line through it type thing. I've got nothing against the sentiment but does a guy who'd be lucky to be 5'6" and 50kg and would be flat out scaring a 80 grandmother really want to be stirring up those kinds of people? Has he ever heard of the phrase "Asking for trouble"?  Other than that went to a few more museums, the biodome etc. I'm a bit over museums I think. There's only so much local history you can be interested in. The pass I've bought did include a few art galleries though and the one I've been to so far was excellent. I'm going to the Fine Art Gallery tomorrow and it's got a few Picasso's among other things so I'm really looking forward to it.  Anyway I'd better stop boring you all and go and do some more site seeing. The insectarium and botanic gardens are on today's agenda.  (1) (2) Incidentally the subway system in Montréal is absolutely brilliant. Stops all over the place, trains every few minutes and they're really fast too.  (2) Sorry about the lack of square brackety type things but I'm typing this on a French keyboard and they don't seem to exist. (3)  (3) Along with having half the other freaking punctuation in the wrong freaking spots!!!! Grrrrrrr!

      This is going to be a long one so if you can be bothered wading through it all you'd better get comfortable.  Well since my last post I headed up to Halifax, Nova Scotia on the bus. After I got there I sent yet more stuff back to Vancouver to sit with my bike. Big mistake as it turns out. The whole huge bike box weighing 35kg only cost $70 but one lousy carry on bag weighing about 15kg cost $50. Ah well, by the time I realised it was too late and it's good to have less stuff. If I was doing it again though I reckon I'd still halve what I've got left again. It's amazing how experience teaches what you really need to pack and what's just going to sit in the bottom of the bag for the whole trip.  Anyway enough about the boring crap. Halifax was OK but far from my favorite city. That didn't surprise me though. I wasn't expecting Halifax to be anything special, it's just a stop over on the way around Cape Breton. I did all the compulsory touristy type things which were pretty cool (couple of different gardens, citadel etc) but really Halifax doesn't come close to somewhere like Quebec city. After spending a couple of nights in the HI at Halifax though I met up with an Irish guy in the laundry room. Turns out they were looking for someone to travel around Cape Breton with too so we joined up and hired a car.  Really I've got to say that Cape Breton was every bit as good as I hoped it would be and then some. On the first night on the way up there our plan A hostel was booked out so we kept going up to Margery Forks. The sight of sunset over the ocean was really breath taking. The clouds blended into the silver ocean and there was just a tint of pink-red from the sun. Really stunning stuff. Unfortunately my camera doesn't handle situations like that at all well so I'll have to rely on my memory for that one.  Spent the night in a little cabin/motel type place in Margery Forks which was pretty cool. It worked out only about $5 more than a hostel after we split it three ways (the third Irish guy decided to stay in the Chevy inn because the funds were running a bit low. He ended up using the floor of our room instead) The place had a pool and gym so Allan and I had a bit of a work out and swim before heading off. Rob and Frances had a sleep in instead.  After that Allan chased up the backpacker for us at Pleasant Bay and we were really lucky that they'd just had a cancellation and had three beds available (Chevy inn again for Frances). The drive up to Pleasant Bay just went from stunning to too stunning for words. Really amazing stuff. I got heaps of photos so hopefully some of them will at least come out well enough to jog my memory of just how amazing it was. I've really GOT to make it to Newfoundland at some stage now. I've heard the whole area is like the best bits of Cape Breton and if that's true I may never leave......  We dropped into the backpackers and got our stuff sorted and then headed out for some Cape Breton crab for dinner. Really nice but there's never enough meat on them. Some time that afternoon a tour bus with seven backpackers turned up and we all sat around the camp fire that night, had a few beers and Allan and Rob broke out the guitars and sang some Irish folk songs for everyone.  The next morning Frances and I had a swim in the ocean and just did some general site seeing. Jeff (the owner/operator of the hostel) took us out whale watching that night in his zodiac which was heaps of fun too. I got lots of photos and some pretty cool video of everyone and a few whales too.  The next day we headed off for Pictou. Dropped in at the Louisberg fort on the way there which was a fahn waste of money and a big tourist con but you get that sometimes I guess. We went out for a couple of quiet drinks that night in Pictou and watched a dickhead on a bike nearly get run over after he jumped a flight of stairs beside a building out into the middle of the road in front of a car. A few laughs, the Irish guys singing on stage again and some unknown girl buying us all tequila and it was time to head back to the hostel.  Next morning we scored free doughnuts, bagels and coffee for breakfast which was an unexpected and pleasant surprise. After a quick guitar lesson for a friend of the hostel owner we were off for Halifax again. Really strange experience on the way home with some girls in front of us that started off waving and ended up giving us their phone number in sign language. No phone reception so we didn't ring which turned out to be a good thing. They were probably about 14 as we noticed when they stopped on the ferry with us.  Got back to Halifax, fahn hire car company tried to rob us by insisting we hired the car on a different plan to the one we asked for. Big argument, got a compromise, only $17 more than original quote but I still wouldn't ever use them again. They've still got a hold on about $400 on my credit card too which they'd better release soon or the excrement is going to hit the cooling device. Stayed one more night in Halifax, had to go with the YMCA because hostels booked out. Fahn expensive at $46 for the night but that included a pool and gym which I made full use of. I'm bloody sore after two gym work outs in a week which is more than I've done in the last year.  Frances left that night with friends, Allan, Rob and I went out and coincidentally met up with the tour bus crew from Pleasant Bay. One of them stayed with us (Robin from South Africa) and we had a pretty fun night. Missed Allan and Rob in the morning and had to catch the bus. Left them a note so hopefully they'll get it and contact me because I'm pretty sure they're going to be down this way soon. Otherwise I'll have to track them down in Ireland (note the 'e' guys...).  As you've probably noticed this started off kind of flat and got down right brief by the end. Feeling pretty tired but I'll try to get back to it and make it more prettiera soon. Sorry about the lack of humor, too tired to be funny (OK, as funny as I ever am anyway). Like I said check back for updated version soon. I'll try to do something about photos too but they're all 0.5mb each and I don't have the time or inclination to cut them down to an acceptable size right now. Might upload a few samples full size of something like that.  Must go to sle....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
