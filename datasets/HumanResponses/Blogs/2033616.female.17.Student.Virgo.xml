And not just any color.. but a bright orange.  many thanks to all who joined in my campaign to save Kyle from the boring world of white.  Kyle, you are very brave.  ~Long day... i'm becoming loopy~

      It seems like the whole world has turned upside down, and i'm not talking about me.  My Aunt Linda has moved out of her house and into an apartment, leaving my Uncle Ed (my dad's brother) at home along with my cousin Jenny.  Darcy is so angry with ther mother, she says she doesn't want to go to the apartment.. she doesn't even want to know where it is.  Why is there so much unhappy relationships in this world?  NO ONE, i repeat NO ONE in my family saw this coming, never would have dreamed it happening to that family.  I really really feel bad for my cousins, i want to go down there right now and give Jenny a big hug and say, "it's okay Jenny! We Love You!!!!"  I wish we lived closer, i wish i got to see them more often.  ::sigh:: well it's back to the history notes now...

      Well, i'm done... let's get this day over with.  I had ACT this morning... hmm.. now that's what I call fun... NOT.  Actually, I talked to Brad during the break... but not only that, he talked to me.. which is even more surprising.  Stuff with him is confusing... we can't be friends without fighting, and there doesn't seem to be a happy medium between friends that can't get along and just never talking.  I thought we had found it a few weeks ago... but then who knows what happened and things went back to zero contact.  So it was kinda nice to talk to him again.  So far that has been the only good conversation of the day (it's only noon but this still says alot).    My mother greeted me when i got home with, "I think someone has stolen the cell phone.... i left it in plain view in my unlocked car on the curb at the seminary."  She asked if she could borrow mine... no way.. she'll lose that one next.  I really don't see how my parents can be so hypocritical.  My father has the nerve to tell all my life, "don't eat or drink next to the computer... you  could  spill it, and it  could  ruin the keyboard, and we  might  have to get another.  Then he goes off and walks into the Gulf of Mexico with a fairly new cell phone in his pocket!!!!  We hadn't even had it a year!  Well now my mother.. who has always said "lock your door lock your door lock your door" and is repeatedly telling me to keep my car locked.... leaves ANOTHER CELL PHONE (this was the replacement from last time... meaning it was only 3 months old) in her unlocked car.  She has power locks... she could be 10 yards away and still lock it.  My parents are rediculous.  Lea is also rediculous... I WANT MY SWEATSHIRT BACK!  it's not like it's my ONLY sweatshirt or anything.. but it's mine and how in the world did it get to Volga????? this is how  that  phone conversation went:  Me: so Lea.. you know that sweatshirt I loaned you when you were visiting.  Do you know what you did with it? Lea: oh yea I have it Me: You do!! good i have been looking for that everywhere.  I've torn the house apart! Lea: Oh yeah i wore it to school yesterday.... why..? do you want it back... Me:hhmm...... well...  YES OF COURSE I WANT IT BACK   okay so i didn't say that but for crying out loud... did she think i gave it to her to have FOREVER??  furthermore... she hasn't and isn't making any effort to give it back to me anytime soon.  She refuses to mail it and says she doesn't know when she can bring it back... but "i want to come to town so maybe when i come and see everyone."  I'm sorry Lea... but i don't care... just give me back my sweatshirt!

      I think Courtney is about 7 or 8 years old.  She lived 2 houses west of us and her parents drive humongo huge SUV's.  I talk to her about twice a week.  While I was in Okoboji this summer... she came to our door asking "to play with the girl on the pogo stick."  MK spent some time with her that day and when Aliesha dropped me off at home that night there was a big chalk drawing on our driveway... compliments of Courtney and MK.  The first time I met her... Sam was here, we were working on Calling the freshmen.  She came to the door, which i answered... very confused to meet a little girl asking for my sister.  She asked me if I could play, and i gently told her that MK wasn't home and I was busy.  She came over 3 more times that afternoon... finally Sam and I walked she and her electronic dog back home.  She has come back to the house about twice a week since then, asking for MK.  Each time I've had to turn her down.  She has a brother her age, and a friend that lives just a couple houses away.  But she still comes over here looking for Mary Katherine.  She came to my door 10 min ago, and after the usual... "MK is not here" routine, she sheepishly asked, "is she ever going to get to play again?"  I feel like the bearer of bad news everytime she comes to the door.  Poor Courtney

      A timer dial moves 10 degrees every minute, (starting in the 12:00 position).  How many times will the dial rotate a full circle around the clock in  h  hours? (answer is in relation to the variable  h  ex. 6 h )  Does anyone know??? It's driving me crazy!!!!!  So i took the PSAT this morning... I think i prolly did better than last year... although I still didn't study a whole lot either.  Then Kayla and i went to the mall an cruised the formal dresses for a while.  And now i sit here... kinda bored... kinda tired... but hey... minimal homework this week (clap clap clap).  So... now I have zilch to do.  I have realized a not-so-encouraging pattern in my life... and have found it's kinda a problem.   Ask me about it if you wish, otherwise I'll keep my mouth shut.    So... turn off the lights, and close the doork, that's all there is... there isn't anymore.

      I am still glowing after yesterday's trip down to Sioux City.  Yesterday at 8... i woke up and did history notes (enthraling i know).  Then i got ready to go and left around 1:30.  I got there at exactly 3 o'clock... and Aliesha and Bret and I couldn't find Jack anywhere.  So after Aliesha left for swim warm ups... Bret and I wandered around the school looking for Jack.  Well we finally just called "his wife" to find that he was on his way home.  He had waited at the wrong door... what a kid that Jack Farley.  So Bret and I hoped in the car and drove to Jack's where i got a warm welcoming from Jack and Amanda (aka, the wife).  Well okay, it was Jack that welcomed me... I don't know if Amanda thinks too much of me.  We sat around for a while, then headed off to the school to the swim meet.  We got to hang out with Anne (Anne's thinking about going to the Y2J2 camp session this summer which means I am THERE).  Amanda left for volleyball eventually... (it's not like i don't like her but i feel wierd hanging out with Jack when she's there... I don't want her to feel like i'm crossing on her turf or anything... but I don't get to see Jack but every other month).  So then it was just me Bret and Jack as Aliesha and Anne came back and fourth between swimming and hanging with us.     So after the swim meet we hugged the very wet Anne goodbye and went across the hall to watch Amanda's v-ball game.  Well until Aliesha was ready, then we peeled Jack away and headed to the mall for some much needed Chick-fil-a.  No matter what Jack says I'm not using them for their Chick-fil-a :-P... but it is a plus :-).  We brought the food back to Jack's house and ate... Jack said he'd take me to my winter formal... you know... the usual...   After one last bear hug from Jack, I was off.  I took Bret home... and then Aliesha and I sat in his driveway for the next 5 min saying... "THIS HAS BEEN SOO FUN OH MY GOSH!!!" we finally said goodbye for the last time (isn't it sad).  And I was off.  I got back home, talked to Jamie on the phone.. things are settled... out in the open and things will get better i think.  Today was awesome b/c i was still on cloud nine after yesterday.  And I just beat Chad for the first time ever in internet checkers.. haha!!!  Time for a rematch and then i'm off to bed.  Sweet dreams everyone... may the horse be with you ( I know it didn't make sense but that's a good song :-D)

      I love my parents to death.... today anyway.  YES!!!!!! I'm going down to see Jack Aliesha Bret and Anne today and I couldn't be more excited!!!!  Aliesha, Jack and Bret all called last night and everything is set, so at 1:30 I am OUT of this stupid city.  Yesterday was not a very good day.  I sent a not so nice e-mail to a very beloved person and I feel horrible... I sent another, apologizing but I still feel like a jerk.  I'm still upset with everything though, so maybe this is a good thing... everything will be out in the open. ... wow that was vauge  So what better way to cap off a horrible weekend but with an AWESOME day down in Iowa w/ my buds from Camp?  I can tell you're excited for me... don't try to hide it.  So just a few more history notes to take (the joys of procrastination) and i can hit the road.

      So what is Miss Lucy's Gossip Parlor you might be asking?  Well, it's the name of this quaint little coffe house in Sandestin, Florida.  It is located in a bright shopping center just off the beach and is the perfect spot for ice cream or gormet coffe, as well as a handy place to check your e-mail (it is easy to see why i visited so often).  The front of the store had little gifts and knick knacks for sale as well as some antiqued sofa's and chairs to accomidate the "gossipers" that happened to strole by.  I found the place very charming... and so i stole their name :-D thanks guys!  Well so far this weekend has consisted of fire (don't worry everything was under control), hair cuts, shower curtains, Chicago, curling iorns (used as a straightener), week wackers, and lots of Spanish.  If everything goes as planned i will have seen 5 people from camp(s) by wednesday.  Crad drove down to visit us on Sat, I sat w/ Becky in church today, and on tuesday if everything goes w/out a hitch, i'll get to see Aliesha Anne Jack and Bret.    Life is hard and people are even harder.  Ho hum to the people that are being stupid and three cheers for the people that are here.  I'm late it's tired.  Goodnight my someone.  signed, Un-frizzy Lizzie (for tonight anyway... and I'VE GOT PICTURES to prove it)

      It has become apparant to me that there are people in this world... that I don't like.  Would someone be so kind as to drop them infront of a speeding semi?  Thanks  On a side note, i hate people that say "hello, i'm different" just to say "I'm different".  People need to do something b/c they want to do it.. not b/c everyone else is not doing it.  Having your own sense of style is one thing, but there is going to be someone out there who is just a little like you.  Call me a lemming?  lemming my foot... I'm doing something that  I  want to do b/c  I  want to do it.

      This is my rant of the day... the wolrd needs to grow up.   Yesterday was not a good day, again... people need to grow up, esspecially high schoolers that act like 3 year olds.  But yesterday was not a good day... so i don't think I will coment on it... it made me very very very angry.  However, there were a few highlights... MK has at least 3 sisters and Adam's name is Alfred, that was it.  Today was a bad morning as well... horribly bad, unfathomably bad, but i lived.  There was a religion debate in Lit and Comp today (the world needs to grow up).

      I cannot be creative tonight... All my creativity has been drained from me.  I have been doing homework all afternoon and evening and now.. look.. night.  I'm going to need about 4 days to recouperate from this week.. oh wait.. i DO get 4 days, lucky me.  Hmmm... anything eventful happen today?  nope, nuthin.  OH WELL sorry to dissappoint, but there is studying to be done... although i'm not so sure it will get done, but it should.    OH GOODNIGHT FOR GOODNESS SAKES... WHY AM I TORTURING YOU LIKE THIS?

      Today was, there's not really a word to describe it.  I don't have good days, i don't have bad days.. they're just days.  Today was a day.  I got to school, not early as MK wanted but oh well.  I hung out with buds in the J-lab as usual, then Kayla and I went upstairs, passing Chad surrounded by a bunch of people that didn't want me there anyway.  Yes, then I had Precalc... and Eric did NOT tell me to shut up today, so that was encouraging.  I don't understand why he's so mean to me, I am really rather normal around him and I have never done anything to him so i don't see why he acts like such a jerk.  Lit and Comp was uneventful, except for Jessica playing "in focus, out of focus" which was funny.. and me and Amber making faces at each other from across the room.    During reading period i came across an interesting quote in I Kissed Dating Goodbye.  It was telling this story about always being positive; (i doubt Mrs. Benz would approve of that semi-colon) This couple is having financial trouble and when the husband gets home his wife has kitchen lit with candles and says "we're going to eat by candlelight tonight."  He soon realizes that actually what has happened is they have had their power cut.  The wife, in tears, tells him that she didn't want him to come home to the reality of his faliure, and that they will get the power back again but for now "let's just eat tonight by candlelight."  Joshua Harris ends by saying "I'm looking for someone who will light candles, not just curse the dark."  How true.  So then in German... it's German-American week... or something like that?  So we're doing a bunch of zero brain power stuff.  In chemistry we had a great laugh over our labs that the stupid study hall burned to a crisp.  7th per. AP Chem sure seems a lot more eventful than ours... but ours IS funny.  In ULE i actually did study for the PSAT today.. well sorta.  Then Kyle stole Hanson's "mindtrap" cards again to read in AP History... which besides that, was not fun.. lots of talk talk talk talk about stuff that's not all that fun.  Mrs. Leistra made an anology to siblings which Kyle found esspecially entertaining.. considering how MK and I get along in ULE.  Then there was Band.. i didn't have to play :-D.  And then the most exciting part was going home... I did homework and then had a March of Dimes Chain Reaction meeting.. which was entertaining.  Abby Hitzman and I are pretty much the only people from Roosevelt there, except for some sophomores, and Lord knows how they got selected for it.  Cam Stalheim must have actually remembered who i was this time b/c he waved goodbye to me.  That kid is just as goofy as when I knew him.  Then I came home and watched some MTV (televison? MTV? what has come over me?)  and my most favoritist Real World member is finally on one of the challenge shows.  Yes that's right.. favorite from when i actually watched MTV.  He's prolly gonna get kicked off soon though b/c he actually has standards and faith and all that and the rest of the cast is just a bunch of hot-headed, foul-mouthed, jerks.  But nevertheless he's there.  It's amazing how i can turn such a boring day into such a long blog... wow.. why didn't i think of this earlier.  Well I'm going to go read "Fall of the House of Usher" which (call me chicken) is really quite chilling so i don't really know why i'm willing to read it.. but oh well.   Happy dreams and good mornings to all, See ya on the flip-side! ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz

      Okay... so i lied, nothing interesting happened in Crossroads... oh but Lindsey did pull a Jamie and ripped her pants.  MK and i went shopping before youth group, we got 1 1/2 pairs of shoes between us (one each and we're sharing the third), so maybe there are advatages to having the same shoe size.  We got to church and I compleatly forgot that we were gonna be doing music.. so then i got to sing some more.  Somehow Lindsey and Jamie got Cory, Eric, and one of their friends to come to church, which only added to my frustration of being left out of the loop.  But what can you do.  I was extreamly hyper and very outgoing tonight... which might have been contributed to the fact that Brad and Evan didn't show, and Craig and Collin came late.  Not that I don't want them there, any and everyone should show for youth group, but it made me feel like i could say something without being ridiculed.  So that was youth group... oh and lindsey ripped her pants.. did i mention that?  Well then i had bells.  Yes and then bells was over.  And then i went home.  Boy is my life boring.  Which reminds me i'm sleepy, probably because of boredom... goodnight.

      Well so far today I'm exauhsted.  And it's only 1 o' clock.  I went to sunday school... which seems pretty much pointless.  I think the mindset of the class is good... "lets talk about issues that you deal with everyday"... but without Tom and Katherine there... there's no back-up and there's alot of empty dissucsion.  They come back soon though so hopefully it will get better.  After SS Kayli and I ran upstairs to practice bells.. then downstairs to sing the prelude ect... then back up stairs after the sermon.. then back downstairs to sing for the closing... wow.  My friends all deserted me after church so I am now here... waiting for my chicken soup to cool (which i accidentally boiled) so i can eat it.  I am so bummed... I thought for once i would be the only one in the family not to catch the cold.. but i think one is sneaking up on me.  Back to everyone deserting me, thanks guys.  I always get the feeling i'm just a third wheel with them sometimes.  Or now that all four of them are at Wash. a 5th wheel i guess.  Oh well.. I've always got my friends at school and Kayli's always gonne be there for me... luv ya guys.  My soup is done so I'm going to eat it, soup is delicious.  Now don't you worry, I still have Crossroads tonight and considering the path that this day is taking.. i'm sure  something  interesting will happen.

      Well today was a banner day for Lizzie.  First.. I woke up on the RIGHT side of the bed this morning after a not-so-good night, then, i got to see Aliesha today!!! Three cheers for the Festival of Bands for bringing in Sioux City's marching band today.  So Aliesha and I met for lunch at the mall, then afterwards Mary Katherine (whom from this day forward will be refered to as MK for my own convienience) and I hopped on over to Howard Wood.  I was greeted at the gate by Kurt and Ross... which were probably the last two people i had expected to see there.  As usual Kurt wore my jean jacket for about 2 min (and i still don't know why he does that) and when i got it back MK and i went inside.        I ran into Carrie and chatted with her a bit, then said "hi" to Chel and Beth.  I would have talked to them longer but MK was running around like a chicken with her head cut off (not really but it's a fun expression) so I thought i should stick with her or I'd never find her again.  We went with Nate to the other side of the field.... meaning we watched the bands backwards... until Chad called.  It was perfect timing because Nate had to leave, so then we went to find Chad and sit with him on the right side of the field.  So after running around in circles with Nikki (Chad's little sister who we ran into on our way to finding him) we finally got to sit down and watch.  The bands were all great, and Roosevelt was spectacular as usual, i just love all our visual stuffs.        So then we left ... but we didn't really leave b/c we ran into Ross and Kurt again (and once again i handed over the jean jacket for a whole 2 min) and then hung around some of the bandos before leaving.  Well MK and I didn't feel like going home but we DID feel like eating... so we figured we'd go visit Chad at the Fryin' Pan and get some Pie.  So we got some pie (pumpkin, my favorite) and brought some home for mommy.        Then, to top off my day... I started a Blog, orders of Kayla.  Thank you Kayla, you're an inspiration.  And danke Sean for all the html help.  Well guten Nacht, sleep well and don't forget to brush.

      Please forgive me for the ranting in my last post.  Anyway, this past week has been WUNDERBAR (wonderful duh!).  Lots has happened... and if you are reading this you mostly likely already know what I'm talking about.  So no need for me to go on now is there?  Thanksgiving was great.  For all those ppl who hate going to see grandparents everytime there's a holiday, or being forced to spend time with annoying family members all the time, you don't realize how good you have it!  I got to see cousins that i havn't seen for 2 years or more!  The saddest thing is that, because MK and I are the oldest, most of our cousins hardly know us.  My second cousins (i think second once removed or somthing weird like that) are just like me and my sister.  Katherine is a 6 grader and reminds me SO MUCH of me, while her little sister Rebecca who is in the 4th grade, is basically Mary Katherine's personality double.  So it was very nice to see family that we've lost touch with.    The only bad thing about this week.. is my voice... or lack there of.  I have a fever and I sound like a frog, when you can hear anything at all that is.  It wouldn't really be that big of a deal to me--sick, stay home, get better go back-- but my voice recital is saturday and recovery of my voice by that time isn't looking so promising.  I wonder if it's in my subconscious, b/c i got strep throat the day before my recital back in the 5th grade.  oh me oh my.  Oh well... Que Sera Sera

      Well tomorrow (as well as a trip to go see Samford University) we have phase one of our Thanksgiving Dinner... much different attendance from the actual thanksgiving dinner. also EVERYONE is coming into town tomorrow so it will be a packed house.  The Guest List for Turkey Day is as follows  Grandparents (2), Me, MK, Aunt Jennifer, Uncle Brad, Johnathan (5 years?), Anna and Katherine (both 3 years), Emily (5 months).   and then those staying in motels... Mumsie, Dumsie, Aunt Karen, JR, Trey (13 years), Nicole (10 years), Aunt Diane, Aunt Liba (Elisabeth), Uncle Brett, Blake (6 years), Uncle Bill, GreatGrandmother Shepard... and I do believe that's it  Needless to say, this is going to be quite some gathering.. and for the first time since Aunt Liba got married (which meant a substantially smaller number of little people running around) the Leslie's will be present... Isn't this exciting?

      Hello from Birmingham Alabama (the HEART of Dixie... oh i wish i was in the land of cotton.. oh wait.. I AM!!!!!!)  Well this past week has been very eventful.  Lot's of deep conversations and late nights.  But back to now.  I have noticed that i start in with this slight southern twang whenever i'm down south.  I'm staying with my Grandparents, as most of you know, and today we went to the Zoo.  The Zoo yes i know but it was fun.  Wednesday I'm visiting Samford, and today i bought an Alabama Crimson Tide t-shirt (woo woo for Bama)  The Bama v. Auburn game is tonight.. and in Alabama.. this is a BIIIIIG thing.  So tonight my Unlce Bill and Granddaddy are gonna be watching the game.  Yesterday's flight went by fairly well.. i was so tired i sleept just about the whole time.  Well that is all i really have to say for now.  Love Y'all (see look at this southern influence... I LOVE IT DOWN HERE)

      My first voice recital..  actually let me rephrase that, my first voice recital that i will be attending.  I took lessons as a 5th grader to, but i got strep throat the day before... so i obviously didn't sing.  Anyway  ... is on December 6th at 10 am if anyone cares.  And right now i can't decide between singing Se tu M'ami... that's italian btw... or No One is Alone, from Into the woods.  They're both fun, No one is alone is prolly easier... being in english obviously.... but i can't decide, i love them both!!!

      Well now that i'm not dead tired, i will talk about my life... actually.  Speaking of which... i really really want to see that movie, Love Actually, oh but it's rated R... and there are only so many people that would be interested in going, or able to go for that matter, so sad... and takers????  Back to my week Tuesday.... well tuesday was Sam's birthday.  Sam and i havn't been speaking for a couple of weeks, however it wasn't just her... none of my friends had been talking to me for some time, no one really knows what happened.  Well I was delivering Meals on Wheels with my mother on tuesday, there being no school, and we were dropping food off at a house just two blocks from sam's.  It hit me that Sam's birthday was going to go by with out a word from me about Happy Birthday.  I hold birthdays as a very very important day, and i feel like it's a day that should make you HAPPY, to be you.  So i wasn't going to let the fact that i wasn't invited to her party, or that i was upset with her, keep her from not hearing that... even though i was upset, i still cared.  So, my mom dropped me off, i went to the door... the doorbell wasn't working so her dad, who was outside, told me to just go in, they're in there.  So i did, i opened the door and was facing Sam's mom, sam aris jamie lindsey and megan, it was like being on trial.  I told them hi, and wished sam a happy birthday.  At first i felt like i was getting this look of "why are you here" but then when i said happy birthday, she actually smiled... so i thought that was a good sign.  I told her I was sorry, whished her a happy birthday again, and left.  I was shaking for the next 10 minutes.    It apparantly really really surprised Jamie and Aris and I have hung out with them every day since.  However i havn't heard from anyone else, not even sam.  Apparantly she saw it as some act i put on to try and upstage her birthday party or something.  I had no intention of doing anything but saying I'm sorry for the last time, and wishing her a happy birthday.  If she wants to accept it, that's up to her, but i've done all i can do.  So, Wednesday, voice lesson.. which went really really well.  I'm going to be in a recital on the 6th of December at 10 am... more on this as it develops.  After lessons i went to Jamie's house, we had planned to talk things over, but it kinda seems that a combination of sunday and tuesday sorta cleared up things.  I'm sure we'll talk about it eventually.  After Jamie's, i went to the Cell group at Sara's house.  It was a lot of fun, i got to see Sara, and it was kinda cool seeing how well another cell group was working.  Kudos to Josh harmon for inviting me.  Thursday... MY FORMAL DRESS IS HERE!!!! woo woo.  It's so pretty! i love it. i put it on 3 times, once to see if it fit, then twice and three times for aris and jamie, who stopped by to hang out.  I love it I love it I love it.  Oooo i love to get all dressed up.  I can't wait for formal, now if only i could figure out who i'm going with :-/  (Jack's not the MOST reliable guy out there, i don't know if it would all really work out)  Friday, it wasn't the greatest day, but i was still happy... for some reason.  Isn't that I sign of insanity?  Anyway, laura and i got in an argument with Kyle.  It was about 3/4 just joking around, but it still is bothering me.  I get the feeling he really does think i blame MK for everything.  He doesn't see how MK and I joke around.  He doesn't get that I'm joking.  No, me makes me out to be this horrible brat, and it hurts.  So afterschool, he was working in the auditorium, and i was very very close to going to talk to him, to try and clear stuff up, but I decided not to.  That was the second person to run away that i really needed to talk to.  So I was a little stressed out and the 50 pounds of junk i was carrying was really starting to hurt.  So I then MK ran off and i found out she was in the library... doing nothing but bothering Brandon Van Westen.  So i left school in a very very bad mood, then Kurt needed a ride home, so i calmed down a bit, i can't be mean to my friends... but my sisters.. that's different.  Drove Kurt home and brought MK and Laura home. I was exauhsted and I decided to finish the movie i started a week ago.  I didn't finish it b/c at 7 i decided i was going to go fins someone and talk to them before i go crazy... well i didn't talk to them b/c i never found them, but Aris called.  So i went to Jamie's V-ball game at OG, they lost and Jamie was very very very upset.  So we went out for Chinese to try and cheer Jamie up.  No state for Washington :-( sorry Jamie.  Then i came home... fell asleep, woke up, went to bed... couldn't get to sleep.. but i suppose i eventually did.  I woke up around 10:30 and wrote this, now i'm going to go do homework for the rest of my life.  Have a superb day everyone

      Wow... sometimes you can surprise yourself.  So, today i went back to school.. oh wait we all did.  Wow.. no school in the middle of the week was pretty cool... It felt like a sunday all day and i almost felt like before the day even started, my free day was over-- but it was still nice to get a break for a day, get some sleep and relax.  Well well well well.. hhmmmm... other people have also surprised me lately.  Who would have known?  I realize that i am being very vauge... that might be annoying.. i apologize.  However i can't share what is REALLY on my mind lately, now with the whole world anyhow.  I should start driving more often... apparantly "that's a good time to think" says Chad  I'm going to Sara Hagen's for a cell group tonight, that should be fun b/c i havn't seen her in a couple of months, and katie geoff and josh are there so it should be a blast.  Homework is calling.

      Yay, good weekend!  Aliesha came to town on Saturday and we hung out and went shopping.  Then we dropped in on Chad putting up Christmas lights, fun fun i know.  After Aliesha left i did some homework and then fell asleep watching the All State Concert on TV (which was awesome ;-)).  On Sunday, we went out to eat at Red Lobster after church and then went shopping.  Did the cell group thing at my house which went pretty well.  Then Bells and home to finish homework.  I didn't have much homework, but i was still up till one.  You see.. when i'm ESSPECIALLY happy... for things like... someone has solved world hunger, or the whole in the ozone is closing, or one of my best friends and I want to try and figure out what's wrong and fix it... well being extreamly happy makes me very energetic... so at 11 o clock last night.. before i finished my homework i did laundry, organized my closet, and cleaned my room, and then finished my homework.  Exciting stuff i know.    Hmmm.. i feel like rambling... Kyle wore color again today!!! only b/c i gave him answers to a worksheet last friday.. but get this.. he wore.. RED... the color RED.  Are you as surprised as I was?    Mateja and I went to the Chicken Dinner tonight and it was excelent.  While waiting in the audi. we had some very good disscussion.  We talked about dating and faith and such.  It was a lot of fun.  Mateja is just so much fun to be around, she's so bubbly.. it just makes your day.  Well we finally left around 10 and i got to drive Mateja's car two blocks to my house.. a big feat considering it was manual.. (note to self... next time i'm learning manual... drive somewhere with absolutly NO traffic).  We will have to continue our lesson at another time.. and place.  So then Mateja stopped in for some leftover pizza and went home.  And

It's been a REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY Bad day, but it was sorta resurrected by my hug before 7th period and the wonderful invention called the telephone... yippie for bestest buddies.  Wow still in a weird mood... still in a not so good mood.. i'm exauhsted... i think i'll go to bed, ha! ingenious!!!

      History notes.. they do nothing but put me in a bad mood.  I have made an important decision today... and that is... life is not going to get me down anymore.  All these loose ends are going to stop causing me so much stress... I'm going to stop beating myself up, over other people.    ....and history notes still suck

      I was once watching a TV show where some evil scientist had some plan to use a laser beam to alter the earth's tilt in such a way that Canada would become a tropical paradise...worthy of billions in tourism.  I'm assuming this would alter temperatures in such areas as the midwest as well...... smart man that mad scientist.

      Halloween shouldn't be considered a holiday... any day that makes ppl think this would be a good time to paint derogatory comments on really cool peoples' car is just not right in my book.  Poor Kyle.    Well last night kayla and i went to the mall for dinner and then the play which was "excelent" in the words of Miss Mateja.  Then, today Kayla was sick... so no movie party at Kayla's.  So then Laura and I went BACK to the play, where we kidnapped Kyle, and attempted to kidnap Sean but he had plans... which was okay b/c i still love you anyway Sean.  So Laura and Kyle and I went to IHOP.. ate breakfast (at 10'o clock at night) and then dropped Kyle off at school to pick up his car.  Why didn't he drive his car you ask?  Well you can't be kidnapped and then drive yourself!!!!  And then we found Kyle's car had been painted on!!! which was extreamly mean and very much angered laura and I.  Then I dropped laura off and come home... only 30 min after curfew.. no biggie.  I would comment on the rest of my day except it was very much not a good day... except for seeing the play again which is wonderful.  I laughed, I cried, i screamed for Kyle and Sean, i slapped Josh... it was a good capper for a bad day.    You know what I have noticed.... the people that my "friends" have been the most judgemental about, the ones they mock the most... are the ones that lately... have proved to REALLY be my friends.  Thank you to all my friends from school, I'm sorry if I've ever placed you second to anyone else in past years. :-(  You guys are truely one (or a few) in a million.  And on that lovely note I am off to bed...

      Not only was it hard to get up on sunday.. i didn't get up.. i overslept.  I didn't wake up till 10:07... ie yie yie.  So i was 7 (yes only 7) minutes late to bells.... and not in a good mood.  That afternoon i went shopping with my mother, and then with Chad to help him pick out presents for his sisters.  We went to barnes and noble and he was very good at picking out presents.. he didn't even need my help.. once i got him there anyway.  He brought me home then i left again for hy-vee... no one is as good at prolonging grocery shopping as me.  Then Sean called me and we talked till 1 with MK walking in and out of my room.  By one o'clock MK had finally gone to take her shower and when she got back and i had already gone to bed she walked in appaled.  "what??!?! why are you sleeping?  no don't go to bed."  this is the same loopy girl who was saying "elizabeth, it's time for bed" and hour before.  crazy girl.  Well today.. get this.. i overslept.. and i felt HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was supposed to go pick up laura at 10:30.. and she called me at 11 asking where i was.  UUUUUUUUGGGGG two days in a row... what is wrong with me?  So i rushed as quick as i could to her house picked her up.. then we went back to my house to get my dress so that we would be able to leave straight from the wrestling tournament for my alterations.  well we got there literaly 5 min after he had wrestled... and get this, we left 10 min before he would wrestle again.  it was very frustrating to say the least.  So then we had my dress altered.  The lady had this fun eastern european accent and her name is elvera.  So we were downtown anyway and decided... it's time for lunch.  (it was 3:20)  So we ate at Pizza and Pasta... it was delicious.  And of course, b/c you can't go downtown without visiting Zanbros, we stopped in for icecream.  it was a delicious afternoon.  I tried to take Laura home.. but after about 20 min of sitting in traffic, we decided she could just come with me to bells.  However in doing this we were 20 min early.. i am never early... it would be unnatural.. so we went to Sean's house and said HI... then got to bells 20 min late... that was more like it.  Oh well.. it was just pizza.    After i took everyone home and took MK shopping yet AGAIN... we topped off the day with the NEWSIES.  oh i love that movie.. who doesn't?  Well now for some deep thoughts.   I don't think anything said to me has ever been any more hurtfull than being told i wasn't worth being friends with.  It's the kind of phrase that has just stuck with me.  I mean, it's obvious that I have a lot of friends, and a lot of friends that really care about me, but it's so sad that you can be inside the most beautiful scenery of your life, and something as stupid and insignificant as a bug bite can make it miserable.  I can spend a day with some of the coolest, sweetest, and most caring friends anyone could ever ask for... but when i remember that there is someone else that thinks "you're not even worth the trouble of being friends with, you're not worth it to me" it's enough to make me want to cry myself to sleep and then never wake up.  I know that i'm worth it, i know i'm worth it to you, so why should one voice matter?          I hate the mental tape recorder.  It doesn't kick in until your lowest point of the day.. then what do i hear?  "It's your fault... You're not worth it... you never have been."  And it always seems no one is there at those times... when the tape recorder starts up again.  So then i sit there listening to it, and all that was said over and over.. the 2 hour tape runs out and i'm crushed again as if it was said this morning.  All i want if for someone to turn it off.  Right now is an I-need-mona day.  And then tomorrow i'll wake up thinking.. "no, everything is fine.. i don't really need her"  and that's how it will be for several days.. until late one night when the tape starts again.  Well.. the tape's been running for about 30 min now.. maybe it will turn off before i go to bed?

      Well tonight was the party  Laura came over to help set up... according to my mother (who was mad b/c i cleaned my room) laura is a "good little helper."  LOL, then Jessica (B) was the first to arrive.  people started sprinkling in.. then we got a big game of catchphrase going, followed by Mafia.  oh it was fun.  then the married couple showed up.   We played Mafia one more time.. and then most of the people went home around 10:15-ish.  Not too long after they left, Chad got there just in time to see everyone and then say goodbye.  We had our "after hours party" and played cards and watched food network... he left at about 1:30... 20 min ago.. and i am exauhsted.  Tomorrow i have plenty to do with shopping and whatnot.  Also... 11 o'clock bells.  Oh it's going to be hard to get up.  Goodnight Sleeptight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite.

      I went to the doctor today... and you know what i say about that? BLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAHH grrr  I have been in a really bad mood today.. i think it's the lack of sleep coupled with why i didn't get sleep and the stupid person that caused it... gggrrrrrr.  Such a bad mood in fact, that i attacked Brett Peterson in AP History today, which was actually really funny.. i also made fun of Kyle the whole period.  It just dawned on me that Brett Peterson reminds me of Homestar.  Anyway, i have lots of homework to be keeping me busy right now, so i must hop to it.  So long.

      WEEEE!!! Well this morning I had to drive Chad to church for our cookie fundraiser.  He had knee surgery on tuesday... and now is drugged up on pain killers.  So drugged up, that he continually changes accents (yes accents, most commonly British or Ausie).  So that was a lot of fun and a lot of laughs.  I'm in a really weird mood... so i decided to wear my formal dress for a while... so that's what i'm doing now.  YAY for pretty dresses.  Tonight i'm going to go see Harvey, hooray for RHS drama.  (Le Mes, second act was awesome!! the first act left much to be desired)  AWWWWWWWWWWW... i'm in such a sentimental mood  I like being "complimented" ;-)

      Face it, it's gone.  No group can survive with conflict like this.  It's irrepairable, unfixable, sadly nonrefundable.  It's shattered it's gone.  Not a haven from the world, but the war's very trenches.  God help me I wish it wasn't this way.  Why isn't it different?  Why can't it return?  When will it stop hurting to look and see the shattered place that once was our home away from home.  What's the point in going back..  If it will only be worse the next time, and the next, and the next?  The Devil is at work here, and I'm afraid... he's winning.  I need Mona

      What's Shakin'?  I woke up this morning thinking, i am NOT going to procrastinate today... guess what i have done all evening?  Nothing... oh well.. I can start my essay tomorrow i guess.  Well today we decorated for Christmas.  I love Christmas, it's my favorite holiday in the whole wide world except maybe for Groundhog Day.  I dunno, that thrill of excitment i get when i'm waiting to find out if Punxsutawney Phil (that's the groundhog's name for those of you who arn't as culturaly refined) saw his shadow or not... wow it's special.  Wow, "how many days till Febuary 2nd daddy?"  So as I was saying, I didn't do much today.  Except clean my room.  That was good, i consider it a personal victory over the lazy day.  Last night was the Madrigal Dinner which was very very fun.  Although i would have to say that last year's was a tid bit better, this one was just as much fun!  Afterwards MK and i stopped by Chad's to wish him a happy birthday for the bazillionth time since i gave him his present.  We didn't stay long.  Then Sean met me outside of the house to meet Jamie and Lindsey.  Then Kayla and Renae showed up, and it was a nice little party on a sidewalk in freezing temperatures.  It was great fun.  Then we headed over to my house so mk and i could change and i could put on shoes that didn't bind my feet.  (I need to stop staying "then")Kayla and Renae split at some point so MK and Sean and I went to Barnes and Noble without them.  We saw Lumer, who is growing a beard for Le Mes and looks like he's about 26 now, no joke.  Conversation consisted of Disney Channel and Sean's haircut (MK is now his style consultant) a winning combination.  Then we went home and i slept.  I slept and i slept and i woke up and all the sleepyness was gone!!! what a concept.  I should take note of that... more sleep= less sleepiness... why doesn't it work like that the rest of the week?  Oh that's right.. b/c i'm a slave to my homework.  I'm procrastinating right now, I'm supposed to be writing my essay on American reform movements... i'd rather eat dirt.  But i leave you now... i think we have some potted plants upstairs....

      Well, today has been a really good day.  First of all.. i was sick yesterday (this isn't one of the good parts) but i still didn't feel well last night and i stayed up late doing homework soooooo... i slept till 8:30 this morning.  So I missed first and second periods and got there just as 3rd period reading was starting.  So i was very much awake all day.  Then, in Chem, we had a work day, and i missed a lab... and while that means i have to make it up.. that means i'm just that much less behind the rest of the class.  So then my history homework: the essay that's due on thursday, she is giving me the weekend to work on it! hooray.   Well then afterschool: Mateja has already given me a Christmas present, so now i have cute snowman socks.  And also I now have my Madrigal tickets, and Sean bought me an Ice tea afterschool (if you don't understand my excitement, everyday i look at the ice tea and wonder "is it sweetened?" so i was standing there and Sean said "well let's get it and see" and lo and behold it was yay).  Anyway, ontop of that, Kelsey's most generous parents gave me another thank you card (i get one about once a month, each with 10 dollars inside) so that was also fun.  And finally... i got my hair cut this afternoon and I love it to death.  It hasn't been this short in a really long time, but i really like it.  Well now i have to go be a model student, if you need me, you will find me slaving away over a heavy chemistry book.

      Naughty Naughty... well today Eliza was sick of course.  Except i still went to the wrestling meet tonight.  But it was well worth it, Chad pinned his guy, Laura thinks she's bad luck, and I knew i would never get any homework done there.  But, like i said, it was well worth it.

Oh i wish i could spell.  Have a nice day

      Oh, so get this... last friday someone...(whom shall remain nameless) and i were gonna go get something to eat... so in walking to this someone's car... we find it locked... running.. lights on.  after about an hour of searching for the spare keys at this someone's house... we, being the intelligent minded kids we are, figure... AAA anyone?  So i get out my card and make a phone call in my parents car on the way back to the house  AAA: Triple A how can we help? Me:  Hi, we have locked the keys in the car, and it's running. we're gonna need a locksmith. AAA: Membership Number? Me:  12345ect ect whatever AAA: Name Me:  Elizabeth Leslie AAA: and what is the, make and model of your car? Me: uuhh....   At this point i remove the phone and turn to... someone... "what's the make and model ?" " Pontiac Grand Am"  Me: It's a Pontiac Grand Am AAA: and the color? Me: Uhhh....   Once again, i turn to unknown driver... "color?" "silver... gray?" "right, i knew that"  Me: It's silver AAA: Is it your car? Me: No, but i'm riding in it AAA:  And you don't know the color Me: it's silver AAA: And you had to ask the color of the car? Me: I havn't actually seen the color yet AAA: You havn't seen the Car? (He sounds very put-out by now... and may i say i did NOT like the tone of his voice) Me: It's a brand new car, this is the first time i've seen it... AND IT'S DARK OUTSIDE AAA: okay thank you miss someone will be with you shortly  Needless to say the AAA guy thinks i'm trying to rip off their service and he thinks i'm an idiot... of couse i don't think much more highly of him.

      I'm sick.. again!!! Grrr... what is wrong with me.... didn't i just get over the stomach flu?  Oh well.  So, new semester... nothing's new my classes are carbon copy of last semester... except of course for the people in them.  I have no complaints... and would like to say "hooray for no more kyle cottrill in my history class!!!  sorry kayla :-/  Well last week was formal... not to bad... not all that great either... but at least i got to get all dolled up for once.  I fell asleep watching Finding Nemo at Laura's house.  It's quite funny actually... EVERYONE fell asleep watching it... except for Kyle... who had been on the road at 6 that morning and wrestled about 4 people.  kudos for Kyle Davis (not Cottrill.. never kudos for Cottrill)  So, next day, tubing at Great Bear... oh what fun and FREEEEEZING... but once again i survived... barely.. i think i was close to loosing a few toes.  Hmm... then we had Bells.  When kayli and I got upstairs... we found MK and Laura sleeping infront of the door to the bell room... awwww.  Then Kayli and I got locked out... in the COLD.  Then we played bells and Pat picked on me.    Mary Katherine: I'm sorry Pat!! there's a reason I...  Pat: no Mary Katherine just get it next time  Mary Katherine: No Pat, there's a reason why i can't tell the difference between black and white chimes  Pat: Because your sister is Elizabeth  !!!! Well.. i never... also.. when i couldn't get the stupid and of 3... she threatened me by saying she wouldn't let me stand by Chad.. doesn't she get we'll talk anyway?  oh well...  After bells Kayli MK Chad and I went to Qudoba.  The second time that weekend for chad and myself, but it was delicious all the same.  I dropped off MK at home and then went to kayli's where she and chad and I watched Pirate of the Caribian (sp???).  It was a good time had by all and Karl made us popcorn balls.  I spent the night then went home and went CRAZY at my house.  aahh too long here and anyone could loose it.  So i hung out at Chad's.. went to March of Dimes... then back to chad's watched a movie... beat chad at pool 7 times.. okay sorta not but he did loose... and was late getting home.  Okay so that was last weekend... this weekend is booked full of me being sick sick sick... so... send me a singing telegram or something... cuz i deserve it :-D  Cheers

      FINALLY on sunday i'm gonna get to spend some time with Kayli Jamie and the rest of the church crew.  I havn't been there in ages... I could talk about semester tests and how much time i did or didn't spend studying... or about formal tomorrow... but i'm not going to.  I took them, i studied, i'm going... that's it.  Well this weekend should be fun, seriously... i get to see lots of people.  Well today i got a present! :-D yay, Mark burned me a copy of the Relient K Christmas CD which was soo very nice of him.  Three cheers for Relient K... which reminds me... did Jack EVER call me back? no.  Well tonight will be... i don't even know what it's gonna be... but hopefully i'll feel better... or at least have a better grip on things... afterwards.  No one gets this i know... but i'm just hoping i can get things straightened out inside my head...   My head... i wish my thoughts were more consistent.  One night i'm dead set positive on one thing... then i wake up and i'm not sure anymore... i blame it on lack of sleep i guess?  But i don't want to ignore whatever it is i have to do, but i don't want to jump to conclusions either.  Now that everyone is in a state of compleate confusion and thinking "what is she talking about"... i must go... sleep... good afternoon

      AAHHH i'm so tired of things.  I'm tired of feeling i have to act a certain way around some people to keep from something being lashed back at me.  It's something i've learned in the last few months... around some people you just have to show no emotion, no happiness no sadness or look extreamly engaged in something else b/c NO MATTER WHAT i do... it seems to turn against me.  And i'm tired of feeling watched by these people... why do i always worry!  It's not that i worry about what people think of me in the superficial sense... but i worry that they're reading me wrong because i KNOW they're watching me.  Why can't i just be left alone to be me? to be happy when i am, to be upset when i am, if i want to have fun with my friends i darn well can.  on another note... YOU TOOK IT AWAY FROM ME AND IT WASN'T YOURS TO TAKE!!!!!!!!! no it doesn't make sense, but you can just deal with that on your own.

      I feel the need to just set something straight.  I know I go off the edge sometimes.  I know sometimes i'm irrational and can be downright meanspirited.  I really hate turning around and realizing the damage i might have done.  So, I'm sorry for being so dramatic and rude.  I am the kind of person who (in most cases) gets mad and inevitably blows up, no matter how long i try to cool off.. it just builds till i get it off my chest.  But by the time I'm done, I've calmed down, become rational, and feel horrible about what I've said.  Oh if i only had a nickel everytime i wanted to take something back.  I just wanted to say, I am not holding a grudge and I'm, again, sorry for what i said.  I just hope that my occaisional irrationality doesn't turn my friends away.  I love you all!!!   P.S. I'M GOING TO SURVIVE AP CHEMISTRY EVERYONE!!!!!! I HAVE A 90%!!!!!!!!

      Well well well, what have we here, over a week and no sign of Lizzie...  Well last friday i spent packing and relaxing... it was a lot of fun... not really i got so bored i begged my parents to take me to walmart, and that was the hilight of my day.  Saturday the band left for San Diego, California is GORGEOUS.  I loved it there, after we got to the hotel, we walked to this cute little outdoor mall a few blocks away, it was quite fun.  They had an Old Navy, so of course, I have a new pair of jeans now.  The entire evening i walked around trying to form the word "Berkely California."  I could NOT think of it, and consequently drove Jenna Lilyquist and Ricky INSANE.  Sorry guys.  Oh, that reminds me... what movie was Ben Affleck in before he did Bounce with Gwenith Paltrow????  Sunday we hit the beach.  Oooh the Pacific, soo pretty.  We went strolling on the beach, got to check out some cute Cali surfers.  The beach dudes were so nice.  Then Ricky and I went searching for food.. Laura and Merky didn't eat, they were too busy buying new outfits to remedy their wet ones... serves them right for going waist deep in the ocean.  We called MK, and made her sad... I"M SORRY MK I WISH YOU HAD BEEN THERE.  Anyway, i had yummy greek food for lunch, then we went back to the hotel to practice for the concert.  The drive back was basically just me smacking Sean Sutton for playing that stupid video game... goodness gracious.. be social kid!  We rehersed and changed into concert blacks and we were off to Belboa Park... possibly the most beautiful park I have seen.  The buildings and museams in that place were awesome!  To bad we were all to cold to move much, and we were shipped out of there as soon as the concert was over so we didn't get to see much.  After our wonderful (not so) concerts, it was off to Old Town for some Mexican food.  The food was great, though it was really cold and we ate outside.  Then we did some shopping and i scared myself w/ pictures from a whale book... oo those things are huge.. which brings me to Monday.  We went Whale watching.. it was awesome and the ocean was perfect and the dolphins and the the the... cold!!!  Then, just when we thought we would never see a whale.. ta daa.. two gray whales.. right there at your service.  They were really really big.. i was nervous.... yes i admit it... I'M AFRAID OF WHALES!!!!  So, with that said, where did we go next? yep, Sea World... dang Shamu is huge!... no living creature should be bigger than an elephant... it's just not right.  But Sea world was fun.. for a while.. then i got really tired of it... it was cold and i was getting really sick of dolphins... understandably.  We went to shamu's house of douse and DIDN'T EVEN GET WET! i don't know how that was possible... but oh well.. it was prefectly FINE with me.    Next day we went to... ooo so exciting... DISNSEYLAND... THE happiest place on earth.  and it was supposed to rain but DIDN'T yay.  Well i can't say enough about Disneyland.. except that Disney World is still better... however.. disney is awesome.. aahh i loved it there... On a side note.. i love this year's freshmen.. they're just awesome.   Well thanks to Seth and Kyle i got to go on Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones both within 30 min w/ ZERO wait.. that was special.  The Marching Band didn't do too badly i thought, it was pretty good considering about 75% didn't know their music.  But ahh well.  Well Sean Sutton is an impressive kid... he started with $380 and spent every last dollar... on who? his family!.. only $16 of that 380 he spent on himself.. everything else were gifts for family.. i was very impressed.  Well.. the flight home was uneventful... if you call the stomach flu uneventful.. yeah right.. needless to say, my new years sucked.  and i'm still woozy.. oh well.. i will recover.  Well now.. i do homework.. till i DIE  Sorry to bore you with my super fun trip to California... wish you had been there!!  aawww that's precious.. aww i love my freshmen!

      Everyone always says "Well i know i havn't posted in a while but someone told me I should."  Well no one has told me to post so... I havn't.  In other news, i don't have a car anymore.  I have a brand new appreciation for the invention of the air bag, (and remember people, wear a seat belt!) as well as a new hatred for the use of alcohol... esspecially when it's a 40 year old woman who doesn't speak english and drives a Ford Expedition.  Friday was not a good day.  But here's why i was going to post.  I've never really had to say goodbye to anyone.  I've never lost anyone suddenly.  The only deaths that I have experienced have been my Grandpa, who was sick for a long time, and Great Grandmother, who's death was more of a blessing she was in so much pain.  Both lived in Alabama, deaths that far away never really touch you as much.  I saw them... maybe every other year.  Point is, i've never really lost anyone.    I don't really remember leaving Switzerland very well, i know i was not happy when we moved here.  I was used to living in an apartment building with a friend behind every door.  I used to scare my parents by just leaving the apartment and going to play with a friend, or once even to a small house on the property where the students and their families would take turns staying for a while.  I had moved 8 times inside the building, from one apartment to the one upstairs, to the one down the hall, to the "house on the hill", and back into an apartment.  I guess i didn't realize that leaving the country would be different entirely.  What i can remember is that i was very sad to learn Sioux Falls was not like living at the seminary in Zurich.  Since then, i have never had to say goodbye.  But now i do.  I don't know how i will take this... b/c i havn't taken it very well up to this point.  But, to say goodbye with the prospect of "goodbye" meaning "goodbye, forever, have a nice life and don't bother to look me up, you'll never find me."  I'm not taking this well.  I feel abandoned and unappreciated.  Isn't it the strangest thing about High School?  The people you want most to be closest to, are the people that are still out of reach, yet the people that want so much to be close to  you   ... are the people you wish would leave you alone.  So, goodbye.  Forever. ~Eliza

Now, take about 40 degrees of heat out of the equation, add the fact that the cell phone was locked IN SIDE the car... which was running of course, stick Lizzie outside a nearly empty LOCKED church... and you have me... yesterday.  Oh i am good... lol, and it won me the title of idiot... but lets all remember... CHAD DID IT FIRST!

      I've been looking for this conversation... I think it explains a lot   11/2/2003  I'm BACK!: your mindset your thinking.... you tear yourself apart Lizard: b/c i don't know what I am... I don't know what i stand for, how i see things, what i want, or what i don't want. I want to be independent, i don't want to have to rely on ppl... yet i crave someone to take care of me.. i don't want things to bother me, but i can't let things go until they've already cut me... i have too much faith in small people... i love idleness but i hate feeling worthless    I'm BACK!:  sounds like you've got a lot figured out about yourself already  Lizard :  maybe... but i don't understand it, i just recognize it  Lizard:  i love myself but i hate myself too... same with everyone else.. i can't stand someone but i can't bare to see them go, i'm angry but i'm sad, i'm happy but i'm not... i'm nothing but a mix of emotions... they contradict themselves and make no sense... the only thing that I know... that stays the same through out... is that i want to be a better person a better friend,... THE best that I can  Lizard : but that all those different, contradicting feelings... make it so complicated  Lizard:  i need to go to sleep  I'm BACK!: agreed   I'm BACK!: concurrable  I'm BACK!:  you should sleep more and think less.... because you think so much you put yourself in vicious think cycles and make you go bananazaas.

      Last night there was a ring around the moon.  It was really cool looking, there was another cloud cutting through the ring that split the edge of the circle.  It was beautiful, it was just clouds and light and water I know, but still it struck me.  The night before, I was lying awake in bed and asked, "God, is it possible, is it realistic, could it be, how do I know?"  I completely forgot about my prayer till I saw the moon.  Then I looked up and my memory returned.  I don't know if it was some coincidence, some fluke, but I wasn't pondering anymore, I was just... Peacefully gazing.  20 minutes later, I was standing at the mirror in my bathroom.  "Was that it, was that the answer?  How do I know what you mean?"  And once again, the only thing that I could feel was this sudden feeling of peace, like I had just been hugged and told everything is going to be alright.  So, is it a sign?  "Is it? Is it?"

      oooo ouch! the ultimate internet-diss, my link has been deleted.  See Geoff? no fixing needed.  AND... life moves on.    So, yesterday, took the SAT.. for not studying and talking on the phone till 11 at night... i feel pretty good about it.  It rained yesterday, oh i like rain, it's not snow, and anything that isn't snow is okay in my book.    The test was at Washington so i stopped by Jamie's to talk a bit.  I really miss talking to Jamie, i wish she and I could hang out more often, but with JO volleyball and homework and whatnot... the schedules just don't mesh.  Youth Rally is going to kick butt though.  A whole weekend w/ Chad, Kayli, Jamie, Aris, and Hillary too!  and...... I GET TO SING.  I really love singing in the praise band.  just 4 days till Rally, oohh it couldn't come soon enough  Yesterday I just hung out all afternoon, Chad dropped off a CD of the Great Gatsby and i then i fell asleep around 11.    This morning I sang in church, played bells, and then had a pancake feed.  It was a lot, and we made a bunch of $$$... and I mean a BUNCH.  I read the Great Gatsby all afternoon and just relaxed!!! for once in the longest time.  I went to Cell group... which was really boring today.  Chris actually had a lesson plan... see we don't do planning... give us a topic and we'll discus it to death... just don't try and come in w/ a plan... we'll kill it i guarantee it.  Went to bells... got yelled at... a WHOLE lot by Pat.  Apparently Chad and Kayli and I talk a lot???  or something like that... i don't know i was talking to chad i didn't listen.  Then i took Geoff home, no...stopped by Subway first and he bought subs... then i took him home and we talked a while.  I've decided i don't want Geoff to "fix" anything.  I say, just let it be, I've had too much bad experience and wasted too much time trying to change someone's opinion of me.    But I am procrastinating horribly, i need to finish my reading for the Great Gatsby.   ~Dibble

      It is with the saddest heart that I have to pass on the following:     The Pillsbury Doughboy died Monday of a severe yeast infection and Complications from repeated pokes to the belly. He was 71.  Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of celebrities turned out, including Mrs. Butterworth, The California Raisins, Hungry Jack, Betty Crocker, The Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The graveside was piled high with flours as longtime friend Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy, describing Doughboy as a man who "never knew how much he was kneaded".  Doughboy rose quickly in show business but his later life was filled with many turnovers. He was not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, even as a crusty old man, he was considered a roll model for millions. Toward the end it was thought he'd rise once again, but he was no tart. Doughboy is survived by his second wife, Play Dough. They have two children, and one in the oven. The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes.

      What makes a great friend?  It's not someone you can tell ANYTHING to.  Not someone who you've known forever, or necessarily even always liked.  Having a great friend does not mean you will never argue, or have some rough times, regrets, or grudges.  Friendships are just like any other relationship.  Marriage, is not perfect.  Everyone knows that.  People fight, they go through stress.  Why then... Do we expect our friendships to be perfect?  Why is the mark of a "best friend" always, "someone you can tell anything to."  Maybe a better friend is the one you need to tell nothing to.  A friend can see you for all your faults, all your quirks, all your aggravating little flaws, but the definitive mark of a true friend, is the one person that sees all of that, knows all of that, but still holds on.  They don't do it for themselves, but for you.  I stopped one day and was shocked, "why are all these bad things happening, why are friendships so messed up!!?  How can I have so many broken, torn, friendships.  What could be wrong with me."  But then a great friend reminded me.  "The difference between them and me, is that they never took the time to really know you.  I have gotten to know you, to care about you."  And that, is the mark of an amazing human.  Lately I have found, the people closest to me, most important to me, aren't the people I am with 24/7, that know every one of my last secrets.  They are people that I have known, that I have drifted from, fought with, betrayed, the ones that grate my nerves, that make me scream!!!  But in the end, I love them, because I know who they are and what they are, that they are my friends.  I've made mistakes, I've treated friends like dirt.  Right now I ask, please forgive me for my own regrets.  To my many amazing friends of all the years And to every amazing friend I've ever lost, i hope you have found your "hero"too.  (b/c Don Quixote doesn't count)

      I was inspired, but now i'm tired (haha ha ha.. ha.. hmm....)  keep in mind i am no poet and the clock is going to strike midnight!!! oh no..!!!   Take me in your arms, my love Never let me go You safety wrapped around me Your presence seems to grow  Now you hold me as your sweetheart Because you promised me one thing You would never wish to hurt nor harm The heart of my being  Teach me what it means to love To fully trust you To firstly trust, my God above I want the spirit that's in you  I do not know if I can trust Enough to never cry Enough to never feel alone Or be suspicious of a lie  Show me that He'll always be The only man for me That you are just a living proof Of love, eternally  For this love between You and I, is not based on us But rather we are followers Faithful in God we trust  I ask you now, please lead me down The path to sanctity And show how YOU have grown to be A living child for Thee  I wish to live to praise the name Of He who sent you me Who brought you here so we could be One with heaven’s three  Teach me how to love  Unconditionally So I will never fail you Nor worse my God mighty.

      OOHHH I miss elementary school.  the day was so pleasant and the teachers so nice... except 2nd grade but we are not going to go into that.    Laura and I and some more AP chem people judged the Oscar Howe Science Fair tonight.  Some of those kids had some awesome projects... then there was the guy who practically did his son's whole project... then told the kid "don't be nervous!."  If he did it himself, he probably wouldn't be bud.  But the kid was darling.  Anyway it was fun, then afterwards Laura and I walked around the halls and I gibbered about my Oscar Howe days.  Oh boy has that school changed a lot.  Not only the walls that they finally added my 5th grade year, and the new addition the year after... but teachers are gone, rooms flip-flopped around... but that library is still exactly the same... exactly.  Oh i did like school in elementary.  The building is completely different, but i can still see things exactly as they used to be in my head.   Speaking of elementary, i was debating the other night whether i wanted to counsel middle schoolers at camp this summer.  I decided against it.  At my age, elementary kids will still look up to me w/out being all snobbish.  Yes i see middle school as the time when people become completely adverse to any wisdom anyone might have for them.  Now there are exceptions i know, like Nikki, Nikki is awesome!  But for the most part... Elementary schoolers still are willing to be taught, i think we high schoolers are too... but middle school.  Here's my complete theory (i'm babbling about this i know).  Younger kids, 12 and younger, are still very impressionable.  You can talk to them intelligently, but they're not yet ready to openly defy you.  As far as camp goes, I feel like I can get through to elementary a lot better than i would with middle school... Especially with the girls.  Then when the kids hit 12... teenagerness sets in.  They become loud and slightly snobbish.  Fights break out about the stupidest things (what were all our fights about laura?  who knows.. they were ridiculous).  These are the types of kids i cannot take care of for a whole week.  Nope, then we hit high school and suddenly you're ready to not just think on your own, but think hard.  It's no longer a matter of being defiant, but of being true to yourself.  You're willing to follow the rules (as long as they're not dumb... like ID tags... what are we, homing pigeons?) and maturity finally starts to set in.  Well... in most cases, we all know those kids who are just hopeless anyway.    So back to my point, I'm going to counsel two camps.. one right after the other.  One is WorshipArtMusic (WAM) and the other is Camp Thingamajig (i know, Sarah is a corny lady).  It will be completely awesome!!  I still haven't decided where  I  want to go to camp, but it'll all work out.    Oh gee... i'm tired.  Goodnight  ~Dibith  P.S. I present my power-point tomorrow... when i was working on it, I realized i misspelled  Absalom, Absalom  every single time in my paper... oops.. oh well  P.P.S. speaking of spelling, i just ran the spell check... apparantly I have never been able to spell the word, "completely" nice hu?

      Cell phones are the strangest things...  I think i will be in a superchick mood for a long time now... here's another song  Some people bring you gifts Some bring you bricks to weight you down so they can swim a little higher  while you drown  some people mean so well Their way was the best way that they found But any other way you choose is a brick that weights you down  So tell me what do I do with this backpack Full of bricks and sticks and stones and words that stuck to me like ticks (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be  Some people give themselves a brick I know most people do  when we compare We fall short somewhere It¹s always true  if all we see is where we fall We've bricked a prison wall  instead of trying to learn to fly We've taught ourselves to crawl   So tell me what do I do with this backpack Full of bricks and sticks and stones and words that stuck to me like ticks (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be  we could believe in ourselves More we could try for unique Instead of trying to conform We could defy what they tell us  Don't buy the lies they sell us if we're brave we can believe in what we are  (CHORUS) Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can be free of all the words we saved Till we were our own enemies Let it go, let it be Brick by brick we can believe in the person God intended us to be Let it be

      I realized something yesterday.  I was being bothered by something.  It wasn't anything big.  I was feeling like I was being treated unfairly, or not being told the whole story.  But I'm beginning to realize that they don't do it b/c they are trying to hide anything, but rather to not hurt me.  That's what a friend will never do, intentionally hurt you.  How can I be upset about that?  I'm taking a more positive perspective of the situation now.  Why let petty things outweigh all the great things?  I just need to learn to trust the right people.  Now, in case you're reading this and you're not Laura McCarty, i can assure you, you haven't the slightest idea of what i am referring to... Maybe Laura does... If she thinks hard enough ;-)  The current countdown to youth rally is at 11 days... I am sooo excited.  It's going to rock.  The song Alyssa and I are singing is going to be great (i just need to memorize the words!!!) and the pictures for the accompanying slide show just need to be put together.  OOOO i love Rally.. if anyone is actually going to Spinsters... I feel very sorry for you, b/c that means you will not be there and you will be missing the most fun one can EVER have in Pierre, South Dakota.  I will stop taunting you now.  I've had a wonderful time procrastinating with you, but I really must do something productive now.  Lizard Breath

      Oh, who called it?  So, this morning we had praise and worship band practice for 3 whole hours.  oh boy, it was long... but our songs are good.  And Alyssa wasn't there, so i was heard... b/c i wasn't being drowned out by her hugely strong voice.  Hmm... so Chad had nothing to do today so he said he'd come over and we could work on the slideshow for Youth Rally.  (Now this is the part where i called it).  So, he said he was going to run to his dad's house, after runing by the music store for guitar strings, and then come over in about an hour and a half.  So.... two hours go by, no call or anything... so i called him.  He had taken a nap, no problem there.  He said he'd get up in about 20 min and leave... so he'd be here in 30.  well, 3 1/2 hours later... no Chad... and no answer on his cell phone.  I knew he fell asleep.  However, for a guy who's already been in 6 car accidents and is 3 1/2 hours late... you start to worry... so i drove over there.  Sure enough, his dad answered the door... Chad was asleep (oh, i called it).  So, to make a long story longer, we looked at his pics from mexico, then he went to subway, then he came over and left about a half hour ago (it's 2:10 in the morning)... ohh... church is going to come so early tomorrow.  However, it doesn't matter... why? BECAUSE TOMORROW IS THE SUPERCHICK CONCERT!!! eeee... okay... so it's not really Superchick, it's the super poppy Zoe Girl... but that's okay... b/c THAT means... less people in line for Superchick merch. once Zoe Girl comes on.  Oh joy... AND we won't be late for youth group... see it all works out... now.. i'm tired... and i'm going to bed.  Goodnight... err... Goodmorning?  It's tired, i'm late.

      The current temperature on campus at Samford University is 81 degrees.  I love Samford :-)... a year and a half and I'll be an Alabama resident for the first (much delayed) time in my life.  Well that's the plan anyway...  Actually when it comes to school right now i am very happy with it... aside from AP tests where i will crash and burn because i have never learned to study and i never really have studied though i desperatly need it b/c i have ZERO confidence in what knowledge i have retained over the course of this year.  (I typed that in one breath)  But otherwise it's all hunky dory.  I went to the counselor's office today and got my schedual changed for next year... NOOOOOOOOo to AP English yay to taking a ME class for the FIRST TIME SINCE MIDDLE SCHOOL... aahh i loved middle school electives.  What better way to spend an entire class period that in an art room playing with paint?  So, now i am taking World Lit. with Hansen and Photography.  Oh next year will not be bad at all.  OOO boy.. i was REALLY lucky that everything fit my schedual... the counselor was shocked that it worked the first time!!  yay is me.  Back to my AP test thing... i have come to realize that the reason i'm not SUPER stressed... just semi stressed about them is because honestly, i'm okay with it if i don't pass.  That doesn't mean i'm not going to do my best, and that doesn't mean that i'm not going to TRY and work and study.  But I'm not going to go balistic over the tests.  I didn't take the classes for the college credit.  It would be wonderful, and I am very grateful that my parents have paid so much money for the tests... but I didn't take the classes because i want to slack off in college.  I took the classes because 1) I like them.  I've been taking acc classes, like many, since middle school and so why not?  School is so much more endurable when you are in an enviornment with people that are on your same level.  People in AP classes arn't asspiring to be the worlds biggest loser.  They all want to be there and are taking the class for their reasons, they have a reason to be there and they're not just forced.  2) I would gladly take a B in an AP or acc. class rather than an easy A in a regular class.  I get satisfaction from the fact that (though i admit, i slack off.. alot... esspecially lately) i work hard in those classes.  In chem, i handle really hard concepts, i feel like my brain might explode, but i think i like it like that.  3) I am interested in the subject.  I didn't take AP history because i love history, i took it because i wanted the harder route.  BUT, i didn't have to go on to AP chem.  Two years of chemistry are not required to graduate.  But, i like chem, i like science, i am a nerd and i LOVE to balance redox reactions.  (laura is dying of laughter now) 4) there is no 4.. but to make a long story longer.  I will be okay with myself if i don't pass all the tests in the end.  I'll be dissapointed in the begining no doubt... but in the long run, I'm already okay if i have to take chem in college, if i have to live through another history class.  TAKING ONE MORE CREDIT IN COLLEGE IS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.  Phew... well i'm done... now maybe on to something productive... like homework?  Terribly sorry about the length  Did you know Samford has a Chick-fil-a ON campus IN their food court?  It's a beautiful thing  Lizzie

      Okay, the word is out.  Lizzie is... yes Lizzie is in the process of a makeover, in a big way... big as in... about 30 pounds big.  I'm hoping to have most of it off by July.  (I can't believe I'm posting this for the whole world to see)  That's right, 5 weeks ago i decided i'm going to do something drastic about my weight problem.  I've joined Jenny Craig... so.. if you ever have wondered why i munch on raisins in lit and comp, or am constantly eating carrots and drinking diet snapples and unsweetened Ice tea... there you have it.  In the first three weeks i lost 7.5 lbs... and that's mostly from changing my diet.  Once i start working out regularly, things will start to even off or even slow but hopefully the loss will be constant.  I'm not starving or on vegatables only, i'm better fed right now than i have probably EVER been... last night i had turkey and mashed potatoes, tonight i had a personal pizza and tomorrow is chicken.  Last week when i weighed in, i hadn't lost anything (easter break issues no doubt) so i'm hoping tomorrow's appointment will have better results.  Yep, so thank you for the support from everyone that has known so far, and i hope that those reading this will be just as supportive of my decision to finally take charge of my own life.

      I have 4 min to write this because i am DETERMINED to be in bed before 11... it will be wonderful getting sleep :-).  I am very very happy to report that I am happy.  I don't believe i will go into too many details, but things are better.  Sunday at church, after certain events... or certain non-events... i was left with the feeling that i must be some horrible Christian, a horrible person who doesn't deserve such friends--really Godly people can't possibly have such horrible rifts in their social life.  I felt like there was something wrong with me, there had to be.  Funny how even though i have so many people i love so very much... this small population of ones that think the lowest of me can bring me down.  Maybe you were right Sean... low self-esteem.  But!  My faith in myself has been restored (thank you for a second chance Sean).  I am very happy.  I have this thing about loosing things... anything.  I loose my favorite pencil, i tear my room apart.. my favorite CD, soon my floor is littered w/ the contents of my room... a friend, and I'm devastated.   So now, to end.  A quick word of thank you!  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      First of all this is not meant to come off as cocky or with the mentality that "gee.. It's so hard being me."  I'm simply analyzing my own thoughts. so don't read if you don't want to... and i'm kinda hoping you won't  I sometimes feel like I have all the burdens of having a relatively large, diverse array of close friends, but never fully reap the benefits.  Not that I have 50 close friends or that these are my only friends (you're all my friends), but the 3-5 very close people in my life bring a little hectic-ness to the social spectrum.     Allow me to analyze.  First of all there is Kayli.  I love Kayli and we have been the best of friends since the 4th grade, however i have since acquired other extremely close knit friendships.  Friendships take time and there are only 24 hours in a day and seven days a week.  Sometimes i feel worn thin between one group of friends and the other.  I love to spend time with Jamie, Aris, and Lindsey, but it's hard to make it all the way over to the other side of town.  Additionally, efforts to combine the groups have been more frenzied than fun.  Doing so requires basically forcing people to mesh... you can't do that.  To throw another problem into the mix, Chad used to be included in many many activities involving the posse.  This is no longer the case because, though rifts have mended and friendships are being rebuilt, it's just not back to that point yet.    So far... I need to give Kayli more time, i have neglected our friendship.  I want to give attention to "the posse," what happened last fall was not fun, and the best way to keep that from happening again is to stay connected.  And, with Chad leaving for college, I don't want to let things just fade out before he leaves.  Now... back at school.  Laura and I were close friends in middle school as I'm sure you are aware, but after that things faded.  Happily, we are closer than ever, and on the same level (hurray for us Laura!!).  During the point in the year when things with the posse were basically sour, or nonexistent for one reason or another, Laura and I grew quite close.  She's exactly what I needed while i was dealing with the drifting of 4 very very close friends.  Now, things in the church realm have been nearly returned to the high we were at last year.  Things are great and growing, but once again this poses a problem.  I could not possibly return to the way things were last year with Laura, i will not do that to such a close friend.  But once again, for things in the posse to return, more time is going to be spent together, but not so much that i'm turning my back on other people again, like Laura, Kayli, and Kayla.  So these are the burdens of my close friendships... with all that, why do i feel so left out?  The time crunch is not all in my mind, b/c most of these people have identified times when i've decided one person over the other, one friend for another.  But with the feeling of being worn thin, how is it that it's 8 o'clock at night on a day with no school, i have no more homework, and no one is around?  People are busy, i know this, Laura is at rehearsal... and the others... well i don't know.  The thing is, i can't give my whole self to one person or one group, therefore i can only take what I put in.    Now you see, (talking to no one... b/c i'm sure you've stopped reading) i have figured it out with my long thought process.  Because I can't devote undivided attention, I can't expect to receive undivided attention.  tada... and my post is finished... i'm still bored and lonely but hey... i understand why???

      A little hello.  hi. how are you? well yesterday i woke up at 5 am... i had to be at church for the sunrise service at 6:15!!! ... which of course means i got there at 6:25.  The service was very nice, only 25 minutes and it went very well.  I hung out on and off with MK and the Bell children and Chad and his mom and sis.  Jamie, bless her heart, MEANT to come at 6:30... but didn't wake up till 7:45.. when i called her.  So she came to the service late and sat w/ Chad and his family and I.  Cindy, Nikki, and Chad have turned into my adoptive church family... because my parents are never at church when i am!!! oh well, it's fun, and i prolly wouldn't sit with them anyway... but it's the principle of the thing!!!!   Some people need to loosen up... like... all the church elders and deacons who glare at us for clapping during contemporary worship songs... HELLO!!! IT'S EASTER, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE REJOICING!!!  Jenny gets 5 million points for starting the clapping during the flowering of the cross!!  It was quite fun.  For brunch, we went to  C J Callaways Easter brunch.. it was SOOOOOOO yummy oooo and they had shrimp and crab claws.. i was in heaven.  After doing some homework, i went to Carrie's to watch The Majestic... movie watching at Carrie's has greatly deteriorated into a critical bashing of every aspect of every movie ever watched.  Then the regular round of death ball, which i believe i lost... but hey by then i was super tired anyway.  so i went home.  Today is deemed homework day.  This was a really boring post... but then i'm in a really dull mood.

      Dixie Chicks lyrics.  Random ones at that.  I really like the Dixie Chicks.  You may notice a common theme in these lyrics (if you're bored enough and have the patience to read through them all)  yes they're all about love.  It's not that i'm looking for a boyfriend, or feel i need one, or anything like that... i just am very anxious for MY love story to evolve... a real one... not one i make up for myself.  I guess i want to hurry and grow up.  I'm tried of facing the world alone, and i want a guy to stand by me and face it with me.  I know relationships bring a whole slew of new problems, i just want to know what it's like to really be in love, to really know who and what you are meant for.  I don't need to know who, I just wish i knew where i was going, what i'm supposed to be doing NOW to lead up to what i'll be doing LATER.  Oh well... all in due time right?

      Cowboy take me away Fly this girl as high as you can Into the wild blue Set me free oh I pray Closer to heaven above and Closer to you closer to you   I made a promise to myself Locked it away deep down inside Told my heart we'd wait it out Swore we'd never compromise Oh I'd rather be alone Like I am tonight Than settle for the kind of love That fades before the morning light  Silence stared me in the face And I finally heard its voice It seemed to softly say That in love you have a choice Today i got the answer And there's a world of truth behind it Love is out there waiting somewhere You just have to go and find it  I believe in love, I believe in love A love that's real, love that's strong Love that lives on and on Yes I believe in love Yes I believe in love  And there aint no talkin to this man, hes been tryin to tell me so it took a while to understand, the beauty of just letting go Cause it would take an acrobat, and I already tried all that I'm gonna let him fly  Wo-oh Swing me way down south Sing me something brave from your mouth And I'll bring you Pearls of water on my hips And the love in my lips All the love from my lips  God bless Mommy and matchbox cars God bless Dad and thanks for the stars God hears "amen" wherever we are And I love you  Godspeed little man Sweet Dreams little man Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angel's wings Godspeed Godspeed Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)  Sometimes I wake up crying at night And sometimes I scream out your name What right does she have to take your heart away When for so long you were mine

      Well I feel icky, thus my absence from school today... i know you were all crushed.  That's what i get for going a week with hardly 5 hours of sleep a night.  Oh well... if i'm lucky i will feel just as crappy tomorrow and MISS CONTEST yay!!! i HATE district contests.  I hate them i hate them i hate them.    Okay, now that that's done, i must say this.  I MISS MY POSSE!!!!  I need a Carrie-movie night.  I need a sleep-over at Kayli's.  I need a trip to Garretson w/ Lindsey and Jamie, a late night in Aris's basement, a trip to century theaters with Sam.  I need a day running all over Sioux Falls with Lindsey, Jamie, Aris, Sam, and Chad.  Don't get me wrong, people from school, I love you... but... the triplets... the posse... the fab 4... the Jackson 4 1/2... I need them!!!  Why oh why oh why can't i have it all.  It's impossible to mix so many people together, (Geoff, you can vouch for me on that!)  but why can't i have everything?  I've found you just can't replace one person with another, each person is so unique, so different.  Remember, i love you all, but man oh man do i ever miss being frizzie Lizzie, activities coordinator for the posse.

      This year's rally was PHENOMENAL!!!! The best of the three years I've been there.  It will be so sad next year when Chad isn't on the counsel to spice things up, but the good news is we will have an ARIS and JEN and again, CARRIE!!! Yay, oh yay, it was fun.  I think Saturday was one of the most defining nights of my life, many tears were shed and a lot was confessed and so much was settled.  It may sound like it was a drag, but I assure you, it wasn't.  It was awesome!  There were hugs all around and I was reminded that I am a part of the best group of friends there could ever be!! (both those there and those still in sioux falls).  Even though no one that went to Rally reads this... THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING WEEKEND.  I love you and goodnight.  Lizzie

      I would like to revise point number one of my reflections from wednesday.  What better way to do this but with Superchic[k] lyrics  1. Boys are Bad, God is Good (Superchic[k] saying btw)  Princes and Frogs- Underdog Mix You hate men, is what you say And I understand how you feel that way All girls dream of a fairy tale But what you got’s like a used car sales Man trying to conceal what’s wrong, Behind a smile and a song And I’m not saying that boys are not like that But I think you should know That some of us will grow Because….  All princes start as frogs, all gentleman as dogs Just wait till it’s plain to see What we’re growing up to be Cause some frogs will still be frogs Some dogs will still be dogs But some boys can become men Just don’t kiss us til then  You found him is what you say And we all want you to feel that way The frog you’ve got seems cute enough to kiss And maybe frogs seem like that’s all there is  But just because you haven’t found your prince yet Doesn’t mean you’re still not a princess And what if your prince comes riding in While you’re kissing a frog What’s he gonna think then So look into his eyes, are you a princess or a fly?

      Oh Summer... I can do whatever I please.  This morning I slept till 10 and woke up and began the make over.  The make over is a face-lift for my bedroom... Or what I like to call, throw the entire contents of your bedroom out of the room and start over.  It shouldn't have taken this long, and I'm still not done, but I have a way of getting side-tracked.  I have $43 in small change and now a really cool collage of Italy on my glass top desk.  BUT!  It is going to look so much fun when I'm done.  It'll be like new, without really changing much.  In any case, I like to clean, reorganize, and figure out ways to make things neater or more efficient ect. Wow... Do I sound like a housewife in training or what?  I went to Laura and Kyle and Jenny's DAPA concert tonight.  I got to see JOSH DEWIT.  That kid is just adorable.  I went to the concert with Kayli and afterward we went out to dairy queen with Laura and Kyle and Andrew Pa.  It was a crazy fun time it was.  Then I took Kayli home and it was only 10 o'clock and so I went to Barnes and Noble and picked up two books.  One is a daily devotional called "Reflections for Ragamuffins" and the other is called "When God writes your love story."  They both look very interesting.    I have a lot of plans for this summer, and that's not just my calendar plans.  But since you mentioned it here they are.  Next week I am having a get-together as my goodbye to Chad, Mateja, and Neubie.  I love entertaining and even getting ready for the party (back to the house wife thing).  On June 5th I leave for Rapid City to counsel a Middle School camp at Camp Rimrock.  I've only attended camp there once, but I'm gonna be Nikki's counselor so it's sure to be fun.  The day after I get back, I take the ACT in the morning then book it over to the church and leave for the Chicago mission trip.  We get back and the next day I start KinderKamp at McKennen park.  aawww those three year olds are just the cutest!  Then the next week.. I'm FREE for the whole week.  And then on the 4th of July I go BACK to the Hills to be a camper at Rimrock.  Then I come home and then two days later I leave for Okoboji to counsel for the Music Art and Worship camp.  This time, it's elementary kids.  Then I come home, grab Jamie, and go back to Okoboji to counsel for MORE elementary kids.  Then, the following week, it's one more week of KinderKamp, this time at Kuehn Park.  And then it's August and I sleep for a month before school starts again...   But, those aren't the plans I was talking about.  Part of it has to do with my devotional.  I really need to set aside some quiet time everyday.  This summer is my summer to redefine myself.

      Here's what I'm REALLY reflecting on at the end of the school year.  1. Boys are Bad, God is Good.         If your situation SEEMS too good to be true... guess what, it is.  He's a shallow heartless child... you just havn't taken off your rose color glasses yet  2. It is but hadn't ought to be...       Nothing is more painful than seeing every one of your fears and failures play out again and again.  What can you do... take the bullet and keep running.  3. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool       Woe-is-me should not be met with sympathy.  Go to someone who's wise enough to tell you "you're a screw up, but it's okay, now what can you change?"  4. How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard       When they leave, why do we pour over the sadness of the end.  Get your head out of the ground, just because you won't let the end come doesn't mean it won't.  They're starting new lives, doing new things!  This is exciting, not sad.  5.  The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart       We don't all hold hands in life and trudge forward, we do this on our own.  Sometimes it's hard to realize our paths stop crossing so often.  But I'm still here... i'm just walking an extra three feet to your left.  6.If you're headed in the wrong direction, God allows U-turns.       You're falter isn't your road to failure.  Surprise some people  and make them proud; dig yourself out... they'll help you if you need it.  7.One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important.       There's a little picture, and a big picture.  The big picture is the reward of realizing the little pictures really arn't that amazing anyway.  Don't stress.  Your fate will never lie in a single task.    8. Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy        Your plan will never be hitchless, your intention never fully comprehended.  Understand that and you'll be rolling before the punches even start comming.  9. If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time.         Be cheerful, not happy.  Happiness will fade, but cheer is there in good times in bad.    10.Sometimes I wish I were a little kid again, skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts.        Life is sad, goodbyes are sad, broken hearts are sad, the world in general is sad.  But things will heal, the sun will shine, and maybe, just maybe you can work something out.

      Well there we are, a new blog layout.  I'll go back in and put my links and picture in later.    Question:  Is is right to make a sacrifice for the team, when it means you will not be there for a close friend?  Or does showing your support for the close friend, come before the team?  Or maybe you can only skip out on the team, when many people "need" you?  You screw people over either way, but while the team may suffer the loss of a player, and the group, one less set of helping hands; when you drop that single friend, they personally suffer the loss of your apreciation, your love, and your support.  So which loss is worse?

      This is so fitting, this brand-spanking'-new blogger format.  I do like, and it's fitting because that's actually what I wanted to write about.  However, I'm tired, so I'll be creative with the blog later...  I am ready to once and for all be myself!  I am breaking out of this little bubble I've built around myself for so many years.  In 3rd grade when I started gaining weight, I just started to sink down into myself and try my hardest to go unnoticed.  I don't do that anymore obviously, but I still have the tendency NOT to grant myself the freedom to be the person that will make me happy.  I'm making some drastic changes in the way I see myself.

      I was reading through some old entries and I realized i have made a habit out of leaving out one of the most important people in my life.  It's already May and I cry everytime i realize that the begining of summer will bring the end.  I didn't leave him out because he doesn't mean anything, but because he does, i didn't want to get all mushy.  But here's the truth, i can't imagine life without him.  When i do, i can't do anything except sit there with a broken heart.  I think of that time i took him for granted and how i would take that month back in a second, i was so stupid.  He's never been anything short of wonderful too me (okay maybe once), and i am so afraid to see that go.  The past few months have put a strain on our friendship, with busy scheduals and college plans.  I'm trying so hard to realize i have to let go, but it's easier to shut down and not feel anything.  The other day, we were talking and i mentioned a movie i wanted to see, he shot back.  "What could you possibly gain from seeing a movie like that, why would you waste your time when there's so much more you could do?"  Well, I want to feel again, i'm not happy, i'm not sad, i'm just empty.  I just want to feel moved.

      I think I'm backwards on a one-way The world spins opposite my say Every right turn is a dead-end "No outlet" Is the new trend  Lies upon lies over which the world toiled My confidence is people is spoiled So now I stand, I thought, alone Broken by this stick and that stone I look to you, now I find My failure is only in my state of mind  I'm moving out of the driver's seat Leaving behind the scorching heat I turn this wheel over to you I can only find the answer in you   I don't really write poems anymore.  At least... I don't tell anyone when I do.  I don't really like knowing I'm doing what "everyone else is doing."  I never read Left behind or Harry potter.. I'm sure they're great but I have never liked the "millions of readers agree" type of thing.  My music is the same.  I know every band has hundreds of fans... But do you really need a copy of a CD you've never even listened to?  Maybe it's selfish.  But these things, poetry, music, books... Are so self expressive.  You can learn so much about a person through them.  I hate having that just thrown around.  I hate feeling like my identity is being turned into a free for all.  This isn't going where i had planned.  Let me start over.  I don't really write poetry anymore.  This is a year old.

      This is the testimony I'm presenting tomorrow in church for youth sunday... what do you think?  The surroundings in which we lived for a week were a world apart from the sites any tourist would see of Chicago.  Beyond the skyline and beachfront million dollar condos lies the reality of urbanization.  Here, the horrors of poverty, sickness, and violence are everyday realities.  The pains of racial segregation, hungry children, and families ripped apart by tragedy, are enough to make anyone question America’s claim to greatness.  But if you look closely into this picture of Chicago, you will find specks of hope scattered throughout.  They are not readily apparent, and by no means will one or a hundred organizations rid the city of hurt.  But they are trying, and they are working.   	On Wednesday our third full day of work in Chicago, my small group traveled from north side Chicago to the south side community of Englewood.  This community, once a thriving neighborhood, has suffered more tragedy than many of us will ever know.  By the end of year 1991, Englewood was facing its darkest hour; in that year alone it had lost nearly 100 lives to violent murders.  In response, Hal Baskin, a former gang leader became the director for P.E.A.C.E., or People Educated Against Crime in Englewood. After learning this, I realize my memories of Englewood seem to be memories of a ghost town.  Hundreds of lives once present, but forever lost within the limits of this neighborhood.   	My first and most moving experience in Englewood was the sight of the old auditorium.  Painted doorframes were splitting and crumbling beside boarded windows and doors.  Once, I’m sure it stood as a sign of the area’s prosperity and culture, now it simply was waiting to cave in.  We pulled up next to the ornate Saint Stevens Lutheran Church.  Across the street was the parish house with 4 foot letters spelling Peace along the width of the building.  This once dilapidated, gang ridden building now held the headquarters for the Will Feed Kids Café and Peace community center.  The Youth director Ms Anita Dominique, or simply Ms D. lead us into the dark building.   	Though I mentioned the building as being once dilapidated, it is far from renovated.  As Ali and Megan found out, the sink faucets in the bathroom have a bit more character than your normal fixture.  The faucet in the left sink doesn’t work, but if you leave it on, and turn the water on in the right sink, suddenly you realize the left sink is gushing water!  Quirky hardware aside, we settled in to listen to Ms. D.  Her respect in the community is outstanding.  Her involvement in the after school program, Peace community choir, and kid’s café has won her the honor of “neutron” in the gang circuit.  This simply means graffiti was painted on her garage door, indicating no gang activity was to take place in front of her house.  But as you can imagine, in the ruthless world of urban gangs, this gesture showed more respect for one woman than you probably thought a gang member was even capable of.  Ms. D’s respect is fully reciprocated, for she makes it a point to strive to understand the gangs and their network of family.   	After lunch we walked two short blocks to the home of Hal Baskin’s mother, whom owns the land that has become the community garden.  The produce of this garden are used in a cooking class for adults, which cooks food to feed the kids in the kid’s café, who in turn, work in the garden.  We spent the better part of an hour weeding, and moving a mound of dirt.  Though the garden seemed country enough, I was reminded of the neighborhood that surrounded it as I came upon more glass bits and even a broken pair of eyeglasses.  Walking back to the parish, we passed the shoddy houses of Englewood.  Once, they stood as symbols of Midwestern culture and affluence, now their run down yards and peeling paint were just another reminder of Englewood’s tragedies. 	Murder numbers in Englewood still rank in the top five highest of Chicago.  Murders still number into the 40’s and beyond each year.  Why then would I see the Will Feed and Peace program as a provider of hope to the community?  Because I don’t see it as 40 murders a year, I see it as a community that cut its annual murder rate in half.  I see it as a community that is pulling together to make the neighborhood safer.  Because, in Chicago, the hungry can find food, the homeless shelter, and in Englewood, children can find safety from the gang violence on the street.  You can write a hundred letters to congress, run a thousand food drives, and spend a million dollars on improvements, but the problems will still run rampant.  We cannot stop the atrocities of our world.  We will never solve world hunger or find a home for everyone.  I’ve learned that serving for Christ is not about solving the problem; it’s about our willingness to help, our desire to teach, and our passion for growing closer to Christ.

      I've been doing a lot of thinking over these past two weeks... And I decided I am not a blog person.  I don't want to tell people about my day, I want to spend it with them or tell them everything over lunch.  I don't want to babble about what's on my mind, I want someone to show interest first.  So, once again to my two faithful readers, I will write again when I take a really fun picture, or when I have become bored of all my projects, or when I think of something I just have to get out.  But until then, ta ta.  I had a wonderful time at camp and in Chicago.  I have lovely stories.  If you would like to hear them,  Let's do lunch?

      I have a lump in my throat... But I'm not sure why.  I was suddenly overwhelmed with this feeling of helplessness.  However on second thought, maybe a feeling of helplessness is needed more often.  I'm such a control person; I worry constantly, obsess over details, and I can't handle it when something goes astray.  I need to remember I'm not in control, life is to big for us to control it on our own.  Let go Lizzie, let go.   Let go.  That's what the lump is from.  I was sitting there in the rocking chair next to Mary Katherine as she typed away on the computer and suddenly out of no where...   It was October of 2002.  Me and Jamie, Lindsey, Kayli, Sam, her brother, and Chad are in the Corn Maze in Hartford and we're hopelessly lost in the darkness of the corn stalks.  "Do you KNOW how to read the map Lizzie?"  Ha, that tone in his voice has never changed, just become more sincere and less cynical.  Then we're in the parking lot.  We have two cars, one which arrived with 5 teenage girls and a middle school brother.. And then Chad, and his car.  For the drive back to Sioux falls we split up... Anyone could tell Jamie desperately wanted to ride with Chad, but never alone.  I found myself in the back seat of the Daytona.  We talked about his multiple detentions in middle school, Spanish, and of course his driving habits.  Ha, I remember when I was so afraid of him in elementary school.  Even up to freshmen year he intimidated me.  It's so strange to go back and look at the evolution of a friendship.  I was afraid of Chad.  Kayla and I pretty much met in the sand box.  Laura McCarty and I became friends in the 6th grade after being thrown together in reading class, in Jr. Philharmonic and at the lunch table.  Sam hated me when we first met, then one night at lifelight we just clicked...   Do you ever stop and think about it?  All you've been through, what you were like before them.  Not just what they mean now, but how they got there?  I have so much to say but no one to say it to.  I'm bursting at the seams to talk about what I believe, what I think, what I feel, why I'm sad, happy, optimistic, feeling helpless.  I've been trying to figure out the perfect person to say these things to.  But I'm just so scared I'll pick the wrong one yet again.

      Today was, quite a day.  Last night was a blast, yay for friends... and boo to saying goodbye to them.  Oh me, oh my... I'm okay.  Geoff has a snippet about me on his blog, he said.   Believe-Elizabeth Leslie: I have known Elizabeth for quite some time. She is a constant reminder for me to always remember WWJD and stay righteous.   I like that part... I don't really understand this part.   She needs to work harder on that.     Geoffrey, do explain!  Last night I had a bunch of people over.  Chad, Mateja, Jason, Neubie, Whitni, Adam, Mike, Kara, Kayli, Hilary, Laura, Jamie, Lindsey, Aris... All came over.  It was my goodbye to my seniors.  Speaking of goodbye... I've never done it before, and it's hard.  Chad and I recorded his song today.  I was there for about an hour and a half.  I've been doing fine for the last week, but when I left it hit me that that  was  my goodbye. That was hard.  I wasn't planning on working this summer.. But now I have a job.  For a whole two weeks!!!  The YWCA is going to pay me to counsel a day camp for 3-5 year olds.  I went in today to file paperwork.  Those kids are just adorable.  I love kids.  Laura and I decided that when I become everyone's favorite youth pastor I will start a children's choir.  "New Goal, New Goal!!!" oh fun stuff.  I have a date for next year's prom.  Date? Lizzie? Never.  Yes, Jason sure is a sweetheart.    I've lost a little over 17 lbs since March.  It's so strange that I thought this would be the most tedious, gruelling process... But I don't even think about it anymore.    I've already decided that next year I will become a floater at school.  You won't even remember me b/c I will just blend into the background.  I think it'll be easier that way.  I'll just drift.. It'll be fun.  No more drama, zero zero zero drama.  I wish it was summer always and forever.

      This is my blog.  I should be able to say what I feel right?  nope, i can't, because then all i will get is a backlash of people thinking that all am is jealous and selfish.  Also, by posting it, i might offend someone.  So i'll just tiptoe around the real thing for now and let you pick up on it.    It's a strange thing to be jealous of someone you love.  There's no way you could hurt them or ever tell them how much you want to knock them off... Instead, you love them, but that small hint of jealousy is always present, breeding resentment.    I can't say I hate everything.  Quite honestly the very thing that makes me so jealous is also the very thing that makes me so proud.  But more and more, i can't smile and pass of the actions as "personality."  It has spread us apart, put a wedge in our relationship.    I don't like it, i hate it.  I want to be able to smile when i see her friends laughing at her antics.  But i can't, because those friends of hers, were ones i used to call my own... only to realize now they'd rather be with her.  I still have my closest friends.  They're my friends b/c of ME, not b/c they just met me before her.  I've never considered myself the kind of person everyone likes.  But can you imagine watching the people that have never liked you, ones you have never gotten along with, flocking to your baby sister like she was some sort of celebrity???  At the begining of the year, all i got was "i didn't know you had a sister?"  by next year, she'll be getting the same thing.  B/c nothing is my own anymore.  If i have one talent, she has it and dozens more.  If I get a compliment, someone gives her the same one plus that.    Since i've already given myself away...  DON'T you EVER EVER start a conversation with.  "Your sister is the coolest/funniest/ weirdest girl I've ever met"  She's amazing, she's hilarious, she's uniquie, she's beautiful.  This, i know.  I've lived with her for 15 years.  Can someone just forget about her for one second to have a conversation with Lizzie and not "MKat's sister?"

      Attention... this post has been typed by Lizzie.. and I'm terribly sorry but i didn't feel like monitoring the Lizzie speech.. so this is babbly and goes on and REPEATS alot.  I had a very scary thought today as i sat on a blanket in Kuehn park with a preschooler on my lap and 8 more scattered around me. The story was about an Octopus i believe, not very enthralling for me but the kids sure liked it. Anyway, I remembers what I had said to Jamie last night about Samford. We were talking about private college over public and I was talking about the biggest reason that I'm choosing private church affiliated schools over any public schools. It's not that I'm afraid of the public school surrounding... And I don't think that I'm so weak in my faith that i would end up turning in my newboys and relient K for Emenim or Marilyn Manson... But there's not a doubt in my mind that going to Samford is going to be the best thing I can do for myself spiritually. I'm so excited at the thought of going to a school that will surround me with people that are thirsting for the same thing I am. Samford isn't like other religious colleges. Their affiliation with the Southern Baptists isn't just a way for them to receive funding or to attract more and more Southern Baptists... It's a sign that every program every professor every class makes it very clear that God is present there. That's why I want to go to Samford.  By the way... This isn't the scary part. What I said next was, jokingly, "Besides... If I'm going to meet my dream man in college, i figure i have better odds there." The truth is I have fully accepted the fact that I'll prolly never have a (cough.. Another) relationship until college. Not to say I don't know perfectly darling (mk word!) guys now... I just can't imagine ( b/c it's not like I have much hope for it anymore) anything getting off the ground until I am in college. What scares me is that I'm counting on it. I'm building up my future around the fact that between the years of 2005 and 2009 I will meet the man I am to marry and marry very soon after that. Then, he can start his career and I can start my meager earnings as a youth pastor. What struck me today is there is that very real possibility that he won't be at Samford. I might not be telling my children one day "your father and I met at the college, at the same college that both of MY parents met at... Sigh." It might not happen. And then what? What if I can't make it as only a youth pastor. What if my fallback option of a family counselor doesn't pick up. What if I don't find someone till I'm 30 and until them am living miserably because I built my whole career up on the fact that I wouldn't have to be making all the money? It seems WAAAY to early to be thinking about this (I wonder if anyone is still reading at this point... b/c i bet you find this very boring) but maybe I've started thinking about it just in time. I've always scoffed at high school couples that change so much of their daily lives to betogether. They'll switch churches, or join each other's activities, plan out their summers together. Then they break up and they have to drop so much. I'm so very against doing this in high school yet that's what I've done in my mind. I've built up a whole plan around a man soon to be identified and... What if it doesn't happen.  I think I need to start buiding my plans around me.. with room for additions. Not around the additions with room for plans.

       Well, I will present my problem.&nbsp; It's 6:30 and I am dying to go out... But I am going to the church tonight at 3 am to unlock the doors for all my buddies getting back from the Presby. Triennium.&nbsp; So I'll prolly go to bed a 10... Not much time to do anything.&nbsp; So anyway I'm bored so I have decided to fill out one of those survey deals but I think I will post it here b/c no one really reads my Blog anyway so therefore I can tell all and still remain a mystery...    &nbsp;    ....Kidding of course     1. Full name: Miss Elizabeth Alice Leslie   2. Are you named after anyone?&nbsp; Yes, infact.&nbsp; My mother's given first name is actually Alice, as was her mother's and her's before her and her's before her.&nbsp; So basically I'm at least the 5th generation of "Alice" and you can bet that my first daughter will also be Alice.&nbsp; And of course my Aunt's name is Elisabeth.   3. Do you wish on stars? All the time.&nbsp; It's more of a nostalgia thing than anything else.   4. Which finger is your favorite? I'm sorry... I love them all the same.   5. When did you last cry? Last night actually.&nbsp; Ask later.   6. Do you like your handwriting? I used to hate it but after saying "I like your handwriting" to so many people and hearing them say "I hate it" I've decided that no one likes their handwriting and it's not like I can really do much about mine so why live hating it?   7. What is your favorite lunchmeat?&nbsp; My Bologna has a first name, it's o-s-c-a-r, by Bologna has a last name, it's m-e-y-e-r.&nbsp; I love to eat it everyday and if you ask me why I saaayyy!&nbsp; 'Cause Oscar Meyer has a way with b-o-l-o-g-n-a!!! (9 hour bus ride from camp... Please don't judge me!!!!)   8. Any bad habits? Oh goodness.. I whine ALOT.&nbsp; I'm sorry guys.&nbsp; I'm gonna start working on that.   9. What is your most embarrassing CD on the shelf?&nbsp; None, I'm proud of them all.&nbsp; Besides... The Spice Girls are hidden in the closet... And they're on cassette anyway.   10. If you were another person, would you be friends with YOU?&nbsp; Well, like I said, I whine a lot.&nbsp; But after that I don't think I'm too terrible to be around... Am I?&nbsp; I think I would, I'm quirky like that.   11. Are you a daredevil? No... I just look on as my loved ones jump of cliffs and play with fire.   12. Do fish have feelings?&nbsp;No, if you poke them.. Yes they FEEL that... But if you call them a dirty fish in fish language they really don't care.   17. Are you trendy? Only if what I happen to want to wear at the moment is.   18. How do you release anger? I wait till no one is around and then I yell and scream.&nbsp;   19. Where are your second homes?&nbsp; 1. At the Presby Camp on Okoboji... I could stay there forever.&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; At church.&nbsp; 3. Home is where the heart is... Wherever my friends are I'm at home.&nbsp;   20. Do you trust others easily?&nbsp;I trust the wrong people.&nbsp; Strangely enough sometimes i start to stop trusting the closer i become to my friends.   21. What were your favorite toys as a child?&nbsp; MY GREEN ERASER COMPUTER.&nbsp; And my cardboard playhouse... And my stuffed animals... And the computer b/c i became addicted to Duke Nukem at a very early age   22. What class in school do you think is totally useless? Physical Science was by far the most worthless class I could have taken.&nbsp;   23. Do you have a journal?&nbsp;yes, this and then I have my Prayer/bible study notebook.   24. Do you use sarcasm a lot? Only with Mary Katherine... She gets mad and laughs at the same time, it's fun.   25.&nbsp; There was no 25....   26. What do you look for in a guy/girl?&nbsp;A strong commitment for Christ.&nbsp; Someone understanding and willing to listen and to talk.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they have to be just a little bit quirky... Otherwise what fun are they to be around??&nbsp; Oh, and they have to respect my decision not to kiss   27. What are your nicknames? Lizzie, Liz&nbsp;(duh), Eliza, Lizard, Lizbeth, LizzieDibDib (Dani Tornow only)&nbsp; Dibble, and most recently Repete and Raman Noodles   28. Would you ever sky dive? No no no no.... not that I'm especially scared of it.. But I really don't need a thrill like that at the moment.   30. Do you think that you are strong?&nbsp; Not physically.&nbsp; Emotionally i bounce back eventually but things tend to hit hard and then stick around for a while.&nbsp; Spiritually..

Growing in sideways.&nbsp; Needless to say I'm seeing the oral surgeon in 3 weeks   35. Are you in love with anyone?&nbsp;Nope   36. How many people have a crush on you right now? I'm pretty sure there was a camper last week that did.&nbsp; He would jump out of nowhere and say "HI LIZZIE" and then give me a big hug.&nbsp; Sweet kid.. But a little weird too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, I'm going to be an old maid i just know it   37. Who do you miss most right now?&nbsp;Must I list them all.&nbsp; About 10 people scattered over south Dakota.&nbsp; 4 staffing at Okoboji.&nbsp; Another 5 or 6 in Iowa.&nbsp; And Jamie in Minnesota.&nbsp; Oh and not to mention all the people in SF I still haven't seen since i got home.   38.

You'd be pressing "Ctrl Alt Delete" ALOT   76. Who is your best friend? New realization:&nbsp; Jesus Christ!!!&nbsp; But I'm sure you were asking about people here... Jamie, Laura...

      There's nothing to say except that I don't know whether to cry or SCREAM I'm so happy.&nbsp; I just got home from a week it camp (btw.. I never got pied.. Directly.. Just smothered by the counselors that did).&nbsp; First of all... I am floating on a cloud because of this wonderful news.&nbsp; It seems my life isn't as aimless as I thought... I improved my ACT score by 2 points.. Giving me a 30... My SAT by almost 100.. So now I have a 1380... And I just opened my AP scores.&nbsp; I'm a qualifying College Board AP Scholar...&nbsp;I got a 4 on all three tests.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I SCREAMED... And then my next thought was... I have to tell someone.&nbsp; This is not a bragging thing of course but an... "If I don't share my excitement with someone else it just might kill me" type of thing.&nbsp; And then I realized there is only one person to tell... And then I remembered that they're not around anymore.&nbsp; That they don't seem interested anymore.&nbsp; At least I don't think... B/c I don't know what they think.. B/c they won't tell me... And they're not here.&nbsp; And when something horrible/wonderful/ exciting/ breathtaking/earth shattering happens to you, you want to tell your closest friend in the whole world right?&nbsp; But I can't b/c he's not my friend anymore.&nbsp; He's Kennen's boyfriend... Not Lizzie's best friend.&nbsp; So then instead of jumping up and down I felt like crying.&nbsp; Because the one person in the whole world that held true to "I'll never leave you, I will always be here for you,"&nbsp;isn't here when all I want is someone to smile with.   Tears aside... It has been an interesting week.&nbsp; I'm always nervous about how people will react to my decisions on dating.&nbsp; People close to me, that know my history, are easier to explain to.&nbsp; But the people that say "ha, that'll never work.&nbsp; whatever" are the ones that almost make me want to cave.. Just so I don't set unreachable goals.&nbsp; Then I remember WHY I've made the decision I have and for whom I've made them.&nbsp; Then they stay standing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So... I think I'll post some pictures now and then go to bed and start my "I've been at camp for two weeks straight I need a week of recuperation before my head falls off" day.&nbsp; That's all Folks.&nbsp; Goodnight.&nbsp;&nbsp; God Bless, I love you (yes... That means you)

      Your success as a counselor can be directly linked to the amount of crap the kids give you.  I don't believe i will make it through the week without being pied in the face.  Oh dear... the prize for a clean cabin is a pie in the face... how does that work?

I will be gone for three weeks but not three weeks straight... i will be back on the weekends so i suppose i will be able to say hello to people then but i will be much to busy doing laundry to do anything.  Anyway, i am very very very very very very excited for camp.. both rimrock and okoboji for both camping and counseling.. so... i thought i would leave you with the above pictures to show you i am having a good time yay.  Have a wonderful 4th everyone.  Send me comments if you love me :-)

      I am a hopeless romantic.  You know this... you must.  It's written all over.  In the movies i love, the songs i adore, the colors in which i dream.  But I'm becoming impatient and it's breeding a loss of self-control.  My mind is wandering and coming to conclusions that there MUST be something wrong with the person I am.  Am i that horrible?  Do i annoy so much that someone would just turn away?  These questions keep teasing me.  Well I'm not going to hear them anymore.  Drew, (who i might add, despite our small fallouts, like Chad, has always taken good care of me) reminded me of my "end of school year post."  The fact that he saved it, and that it meant that much to him was so very nice to hear.  Thank you so very much Drew.  You will notice that my list starts at #2.  number 1 was just a little harsh.  It was revamped and you can find it in my archives on may 30th if you like.  Here is my list.  2. It is but hadn't ought to be... Nothing is more painful than seeing every one of your fears and failures play out again and again. What can you do... take the bullet and keep running.  3. The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool Woe-is-me should not be met with sympathy. Go to someone who's wise enough to tell you "you're a screw up, but it's okay, now what can you change?"  4. How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard When they leave, why do we pour over the sadness of the end. Get your head out of the ground, just because you won't let the end come doesn't mean it won't. They're starting new lives, doing new things! This is exciting, not sad.  5. The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart We don't all hold hands in life and trudge forward, we do this on our own. Sometimes it's hard to realize our paths stop crossing so often. But I'm still here... i'm just walking an extra three feet to your left.  6.If you're headed in the wrong direction, God allows U-turns. You're falter isn't your road to failure. Surprise some people and make them proud; dig yourself out... they'll help you if you need it.  7.One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one's work is terribly important. There's a little picture, and a big picture. The big picture is the reward of realizing the little pictures really arn't that amazing anyway. Don't stress. Your fate will never lie in a single task.  8. Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy Your plan will never be hitchless, your intention never fully comprehended. Understand that and you'll be rolling before the punches even start comming.  9. If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time. Be cheerful, not happy. Happiness will fade, but cheer is there in good times in bad.  10.Sometimes I wish I were a little kid again, skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts. Life is sad, goodbyes are sad, broken hearts are sad, the world in general is sad. But things will heal, the sun will shine, and maybe, just maybe you can work something out.
