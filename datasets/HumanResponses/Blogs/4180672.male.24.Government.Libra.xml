      Well to start this isn't an account of my pathetic life for the last few days. This is a bullshit rant through and through. To start with I watched the phenomenal Alex Jones documentary 911 : The Road to Tyranny last night. This is a FREE download from the internet so it made it that much better. This guy has been called a conspiracy nut by all the media but the fact is his film states FACTS. This movie was actually more scary than anything Hollywood has put out in years due to the subject matter alone. America is fucked. Along with the rest of the world. The NWO is taking over kids, you just have to realise it sooner than later. I have read alot of shit on conspiracy theories etc. but that facts dont lie. Why does the Bush family own companies with the Bin Laden family?? Why were FBI agents threatened with arrest if they DIDN'T let Al Quada agents into the country. Why did the US government not want anything to do with the Sudan government after they offered Bin Laden to them on a platter?? It is a scary situation and all I can say is I'm glad I wont be alive in the generation that is going to see this global government. Surely the Aussie government has a slight clue about what is going on. Fuck John Howard. I can not stand that Mr. Sheen looking cunt and his fucking stuttering ribble rabble statements. I hope to fucking hell that Latham wins and puts his foot down for this fucking country. Aussie troops should NOT be fighting in Bush's so called "War on Terror" as it is. And the so called Patriot Act in the USA is nothing more than a deprivation of liberty. With the way we are heading I wouldnt be surprised to see this instated in Australia in the near future. But I'll give you the tip, if they try hell is gonna break loose. I could rant about this subject for hours but I'll stop here. My next rant is about the perception of white people in concern with hiphop. I browse the UGHH boards every week to see the latest hate posts against whites. With these so called "purists" having post counts that top 7000 posts, blaming any white emcee on the influx of "whiteyism" in hiphop today. The fact of the matter is that without the white fanbase these big bling "rap" stars in the US wouldn't have shit. It's a known fact that the majority of record sales for guys like 50 Cent, Fabolous, Ludacris, Puffy come from white kids. By kids I mean 12-18 year old american wiggers who just realised that rap is the cool thing to be involved with. I am not a racist at all but the fact that african american hiphop fans are blaming white emcee's for the downfall of hiphop sickens me. Guys like 50 Cent, Lil Jon, Cassidy are what is ruining hiphop. If someone like Cassidy popped up back in the days of Eric B&amp; Rakim and Public Enemy he would get clowned so hard he would go into hiding. The whole image factor is what is ruining hiphop. Aussie kids need to realise its not what you drive, what you wear and how many times you get played on MTV that matters. It's the quality of the emcee and the production that matters. Guys like Hilltop Hoods are what hiphop is about. They have been the best aussie hiphop group out there for years and probably always will be because of their pure skills. It shits me when a guy like Scribe gets a top ten hit just because of his fake american accent. Sure I cant deny that the production was insane on that track but it wouldnt have done as good if rapped in a kiwi accent. This is a fact and you know it. Hilltop Hoods are getting a fair bit of play on aussie indy radio these days which is great but the aussie public will still never except the accent. "Ocker Rap". Wake up you fucks this is Australia! Now I could write 50 pages on why Eminem is the next Vanilla Ice but there is no point. His shit will still sell like hot cakes even though all his beats use the same samples and sound exactly the same. There are more white emcees than Eminem. You people do realise this? I mean Atmosphere got that Trying to Find a Balance video all over MTV in the states but realistically Overcast should have been all over the charts years ago. Why wasn't it? Because the general idea is that whitey doesnt belong and doesn't know the struggle. Which brings me to my next thoughts. Necro. Psycho-Logical Records. Kids hate on him so much for what he is doing and has done. They cant accept the fact the man is a genius on the boards and is nice on the mic. They label him Nerd-Rap even though he grew up in the projects in Brooklyn and made his own way and started his own label BY HIMSELF. He isn't Horrorcore he is just pure hardcore rap. He hqas his own porn company and directs porn videos for fucks sake. The man is a new age entrepeneur and is what hiphop is meant to be about. He is putting out 10 albums in 12 months. 10! You realise that is atleast 120 fresh beats. No one is working any harder than Necro at the moment. For fucks sake Australia. Wake Up! Support real hiphop instead of multi million dollar companies putting out the next bullshit money spinner. Give the real guys what they deserve. Until next time.....DIE.

      God damn my feet are getting worse. The doc tells me its just cold feet but now I'm getting little blood blisters on my toes and they hurt like fuck when I walk. Since I didn't recieve a phone call at all yesterday I guess my blood test and toe scrapings were fine. I'm gonna have to make another appointment though because the shit on my feet isn't normal. Summerslam was a pretty decent PPV this year with Benoit dropping the title to Orton. It was a bit of a surprise but I guess Vince is grooming Orton to be the next big thing. The London/Kidman 6 man tag was good and if they dont see Pual London's true potential soon he will be back on Velocity when they lose the titles to the Dudleys in the near future. Taker v JBL was just really bad and the chokeslam through the limo bit was lame. Angle v Guerrero was as good as it gets in the WWE with Angle working Eddie's leg from the start. Hopefully since Angle picked up the win they will put the title on him soon to get it away from that stooge Bradshaw. Finally ordered some new tapes today with the Noah dome show, Pride Bushido 4 and some ROH/Toryumon stuff. Hopefully I'll get them next week because I've been looking forward to seeing that Kobashi v Akiyama GHC title match. Burning Hammer baby! Finished Samurai Warriors on the weekend with all the characters. That game is fucking addictive and it would take too long to finish it 100% so I'll just leave it. Since I've finished everything I got now I'll just wait for Silent Hill 4 and some others to come out before I get another bunch. I'm out like new age mullets SHOULD be...

      Well, finally got my blood test and toe scraping today. Got there early and since there was fuck all people I actually got to go straight in. There's something unsettling about laying your crusty looking foot on a stool for some nurse to scrape blistered skin off your toes. I wasn't even told I'd need to fast before my blood test but since I had a coffee in the morning the results might not be totally accurate apparently. Had a major sleep-in compared to my standards the other day. After I got back from playing pool I had the usual half bottle of scotch and went to bed. I ended up sleeping to 11am which is a rarity for me. It's getting to the stage where I cant get to sleep before midnight unless I have half a bottle. I mean, I could drink the whole bottle but I dont want to be seedy the next day. Finished Shadow Ops the other day. Not a bad FPS. Started up Samurai Warriors today though. This game is sweet and has a shitload of unlockables so it should keep me going for ages. Nothing better than killing 800 people with one guy. Not a hell of alot happening in my world so no more blogs til wrestling is done for the week. Or if I'm full of piss no doubt I'll type up some bullshit. I'm out like John Howard in the next election.

      Well, today my dad and brother and me went down to the local pool hall. It was definitely a change of pace for me since I basically don't do anything at all. I managed to beat my old man 3 times which is a pretty big deal. Another big deal was the price of booze there. Fucking 7 bucks for a Walker?? Still it didnt stop us having four rounds of them. Total cost of the outing was around 120 bucks but abut 90 dollars was spent on piss. But all in all it was a good time. Played Shadow Ops a fair bit today. This is a pretty underrated game. Usually I'm not a big fan of FPS but this one is quite good. The enemy AI is decent but no matter where they find cover you can always score a headshot. Speaking of FPS games I am very much looking forward to Doom 3/Halo 2/Half-Life 2 to come out on xbox. But all of them aint shit compared to my fiending for Fable. I'm so sick of ps2 fanboys claiming the FF series is godly. I agree that the series has set the bar for other RPG's to follow but still, xbox NEEDS Fable to succeed. Fucking Molyneaux better live up to this hype because I dont want another Black &amp; White all over again. But the gameplay footage I've seen and the thoughts of the major review sites guys have me pumped. Another fiending I have is to finally see Hellboy. Fucking Australia is the U.S.A's second biggest ally yet we still have to wait 5 months to get it in theatres??? The fucking retail DVD is out in the states for fucks sake. Maybe I'll just buy a pirated version instead of paying 14 bucks to see it at the pissweak aussie cinema. Still listening to the new Hyde and its getting better with every listen. 'Bums' is a killer track and Hyde's descriptions of the hobo lifestyle had me rolling. But the track does feature the debut of Uncle Howie on the mic. As you would expect Howie's rhymes aren't exactly mindblowing but the novelty and subject matter are hilarious. And of course Necro kills it on the beat aswell. Now for some comedy. I went to lock the front door before I went to bed last night and stood on the fucking prongs of an extension cord. Needless to say I went cunt up and headbutted my folks door and got a nice carpet burn all up my knee. I am the 4th stooge bitches. Until next time....

      Well, I always wanted to start one of these so here we go. Copped the new Mr. Hyde album today. Hyde has defintely improved on the mic since the early days and Necro's production is definitely still great, but I do prefer the production on Ill Bill's album. Although I do have a new favourite song which is from Hyde's album. Malignant Messiah has the craziest church organ beat I've ever heard. This week's wrestling wasn't too good. Raw was pretty lackluster and since they are leaning towards a Eugene/HHH fued I cant say I'll be on the edge of my seat. Smackdown on the other hand is getting better especially since they have the tag titles on London and Kidman. It's a pity London can't use his SSP since I think it's the best in the business but I had a feeling he would debut the 450 splash. Just the thought of stereo SSP/450's on PPV makes it worth buying. I really should get some new puro tapes though. Reading the results on the net doesn't do it for me and considering the G1 climax has started I think I need to stop spending money on xbox games. Speaking of which I finished Sudeki this week. With all the bad reviews it's been getting (gamespot), I still cant help but think this is a very good game. The fact that it isn't a traditional turn-based rpg like every xbox fanboy wants, makes it even better. The combat system was great and the background/area graphics were some of the best but as the reviews say the character detail is pretty bad. But all in all it was very enjoyable while it lasted. Also finished off Spiderman 2 and Legends of Wrestling:Showdown. Currently I'm playing Shadow Ops and Samurai Warriors 4 and also messing about with MTV Music Gen 3. Healthwise I went down to the pathology joint to get my foot checked out and to get a blood test but the fuckin place was chockers. I only lasted 20 minutes in there and left. Stupid bitch said I would be in and out in 20 minutes but what the fuck did she know? So I guess tomorrow I will get off my ass and get in there early to catch a stabbing and toe scraping. Signing out bitches.
