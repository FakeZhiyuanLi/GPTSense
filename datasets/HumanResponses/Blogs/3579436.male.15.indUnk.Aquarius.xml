Then we finish around 3:30 and r all sweaty and shit. We didnt kno wat the plans were for the game so we call taylor. We find out we're supposed to b at his house at around 5 at 4. So me and mike r runnin around tryin to get ready n time. We sum how do it and were off to the game. Supposed to b a great game rite, the rocket pitchin nvr had a loss b4 rite? well i guess im bad luk cuz he got his first. So its bout the 6th inning and im gettin bored cuz the astros r down 6-0 and the damn cubs fans keep cheerin, i hate them. But it's all good cuz after that we met these two kool chiks and stopped watchin the game. Theyre both prtty hot i thnk. So we get home and im by myself for once wow.

      There was just a major battle n my house......my mom comes downstairs and starts throwing shit at me then she says, "Alesx you stole $100 from your siters just so you can go buy your damn cds and eat at Burger King with your friends." First off nice examples by my mom, but i didn't take ne money. Next she stormed off being the bitch she is. The only other one home was my brother so i thought it was him and the lil queer throws a plastic tea cup at me and hits me n the side of the head so i get all pissed.....i'm sittin there bangin on his door tryin to break it down. Then the phone rings and i go to answer it and it's my sister. I told her bout wat was goin on and she's like yea i had $150 i'm gonna kill that bastard.....one of the few times i've heard her curse. Then my bro charges me with a walkign stick and i take it from em and hit em n the bak of the legs so he goes bak to his room cryin and then the phone rings again. Turns out Katie had $150 in gift cards and money....who the fuck counts gift cards as money!?!?!? Then my mom called acting like nothing happened....that's how she is and i tell her and she's like ohhhh good......keep n mind not sorry for smashing your head with a broom, she just avoids it. So all of this shit for nothing....sumtin like this happens evry damn day n my house i get n trouble for no damned reason....who cares that's why i stay away. Well that's the end......l8a dawgs.
