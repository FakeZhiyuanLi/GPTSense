      yesterday, i ventured off to slim's to see a great band south.  metric opened for them.  they were ok.  while watching them all i could think is that this band is as if wynona ryder wanted to be hipster and start a band.  someone tried to crowd surf, but who in the hell tries to crowd surf to a hipster band?  so south came on and they were great.  again, all i can say is that british boys are so hot.  and i love their accent and slang, saying the crowd was ace.  although i found it strange the guys up front were trying to mosh during the show.  how in the hell can you mosh to south?  whatever.....more power to them just as long as they stay the hell away from me.  i did discover the way to get people to stay away from you is to drop your glass full of whatever.  people fly away from you as if you can't control your farts.  i did go alone which is fine by me.  however the five out of the next six concerts i am going to, i am going alone.  oh well......  after the show, i walked by a couple of clubs to get to my car.  i came to the conclusion that i can't do clubs.  it is not that i am anti social.  i just rather do concerts.  at concerts, focus and attention is always on the band.  no matter how dumb you look or how clumsy you are, the band always grasps the audience.  well there are those exceptions who go to concerts to get shit faced but they are so few.  everyone is there to be wowed and amazed.  however at clubs, at least for me, you have to be so self conscious about your cool factor.  it's ridiculous.  most people go to clubs, as i see it, to work the room.  so your focus and attention is centered on EVERYONE'S view and opinion.  so if you mess up just once, that's it.  being the center of attention is not my thing.  at least at concerts, i can feel happy when i feel like i'm the only one in the room with the band playing.  man i can't wait for starsailor.

      so on my day off i had the pleasure of spending over four hundred dollars on my car.  hey no problem, i work full time now and plus i am finally making double digits at lovely tower records.  now i just have to wait probably three weeks until i qualify for benefits.  so tonite was my second nite of class in creative writing.  and because it is second nite, it is audition nite.  for those who will be writing plays, they will need actors to act them out for the class.  as a result, the pool of actors they will be selecting from is the class.  i admit i am not an actor, but when my professor gave me my role, i know i am a rude blunt campy gay son of a bitch who acts like he knows everything.  the role was a mean old teacher who is reunited with one of his lazy failed students on an airplane.  the mean old teacher is based on my professor who is blunt campy and gay.  i did ok......considering how shy i get in front of strangers.  the great part about my audition is that i got to do it with this really cute dirty lookin white boy with dreds.  i fit my part and he fit his pretty good too.  during class, i decided my pen name, when i become a part time writer, is going to be L. Cheshire.  L.  stands for Lee because i need to keep a part of my real name.  the reason why i just don't use lee is because L. Cheshire sounds so much cooler.  and well cheshire is for that damn cat from alice in wonderland.  if i could be reincarnated as a cartoon character it would most definetly be the cat.  and it's so british, and anyone who knows me knows i am a big anglophile.  so everyone look out for L. Cheshire.... i will be standing on my head in stores near you.  speaking of that damn cat, the new alice in wonderland dvd came out today and i got it.  i also got the dvd for bang bang you're dead.  crazy students taking justice.  a must see.  speaking of crazy, starsailor album came out today.  i bought it as an import back in september because that is just me.  i need to have new music right away, but then when this us version comes out.  not only is it cheaper but it has extra tracks........  DAMN THEM....  good news is that i get to hang out with the tower crew at the starsailor concert.  i get to sit in a nice booth and sell cd's while watching the concert.  and maybe i might get to meet the band.  highlight of the day though was getting a surprise package from chris.  that sneaky little devil.  sent me not one but TWO mixed cd's.  he's so sweet.

      1) going to the special live105 studio sesssion private travis concert with only 50 other people and sitting only five feet away from them 2) songs played at the private concert: quicksand, reoffender, beautiful occupation, love will come through, sing, why does it always rain on me 3) fran cut his hair which i think makes him soooooooo hot and adorable and neil was looking great considering he did break his neck 4) finding out each band member's favourite swear word: mr. francis healy = fuck, mr. douglas payne = cock, mr. andrew dunlop = cock, mr. niel primrose = pod (british version of cock)........such gay sexual ineuendo between them.  one would question 5) during the q&a fran running around the room with the mic acting he's like jerry springer 6) going to the big travis concert at the warfield (my spot in the warfield and the crowd were fucking awesome) 7) seeing sergio at the concert........boy did i have a crush on that boy even before he lost the weight 8) songs played (now i don't remember the order): all i wanna do is rock (andy that crazy boy standing on his amp), writing to reach you, the fear, as you are, driftwood, turn (with audience participation), why does it always rain on me, sing, side, pipe dreams, humpty dumpty love song, flowers in the window (fran alone acoustic without the pa system or a mic mind you), quicksand, beautiful occupation, reoffender, peace the fuck out, happy to hang around, mid life krysis, love will come through, somewhere else 9) fran thanking the audience for getting passed all the crack dealers to get to the show, but saying that he loves the west coast all together 10) adam, the keyboardist, was kinda cute with that as fran puts it that joan of arc hair style.  but it was very british which just increases the odds of me ending up with a british guy 11) fran kissing dougie on the neck while dougie sang his part in turn which just confirms my belief that fran is atleast bi sexual (even though i don't believe bi sexual people don't exist because guys who say they are bi are gay guys wanting to still be cool with their straight friends and girls who say they are bi are straight girls wanting to be cool) so i do have a chance with fran.  and it wasn't just a peck on the neck.  it was full on macking.  12) feeling conflicted because 1) there was no warfield poster (i was robbed) but 2) they said they would be coming back soon (most likely fall after headlining all those festivals in the uk in the summer)

      so i started school yesterday.  creative writing 35E for novels and plays.  the teacher is this older gay blunt to the point anecdotal campy yet very intelligent professor with a Phd in literature.  it was a very entertaining class.  first few important/entertaining things i learned 1) don't write for the sake of writing, 2) don't expect to be a best seller, 3) always present conflict and a major question, 4) you have to catch your audience in the first page because americans have really really short attention spans, and 5) if you wanna be a good writer don't put yourself in a genre.  this class is composed of your predictable older adults who have nothing better with their lives so they have the hope to being some artistic writer, the indie kids who desire to create this revolution (uh hello me!!!!), and those wanna be best sellers expecting to rake in the dough.  oh and another important aspect learned 6) don't expect to rake in the dough.  i can see the novels and plays forming just by looking at each student.  we are all gonna write about things we relate to and make ourselves the main character.  you have the kid who ventured out to the west coast to discover themselves.  you have the minority over coming all adversity to achieve their goals.  it's only natural and vain/self-centered.  i really like the teacher.  apparently for the play writers, they must have their scenes acted out.  so all the students have to audition.  i'm not an actor or a play writer, but i still have to try out.  my future looks so bleek.  i'm kinda reliant on my mum, but i really need to start having the confidence that i can make it on my own doing whatever.  i don't mind being a short-order cook who can pay his bills and afford a concert now and again.  but  i dream of being that genetic researcher by day and underground novelist by night.

      i can't help it if i am good at my job, both the good and bad aspects at it.  so what if one of my talents includes being able to insult anyone without knowing one thing about them?  or knowing the absolute most wrong thing to say at the most inappropriate time?  or knowing how to make an employee i hate really really frustrated and want to quit?  but today my techincal skills were being tested at ticketmaster.  i was so good today at three onsales that i was able to get 15 dollars worth of tips even though it was just from one guy.  so i decided to rub in to everyone the me, mr. no skills in customer service, got 15 dollars worth of tips.  rachel, my boss, said i couldn't keep it because it was against the rules.  of course the glare contest came along and then she ordered me to use the money to buy the clerks the cookies and candy we sell.  due to an amazing discount, i was able to get a shit load of candy.  so all the little freakin clerks got to eat my money.  had i known i would be forced to do this i would have burned the money in rachel's face..... and believe me i would.  i did get myself i a lollipop, but then rachel told me it was bad that i was sucking on it while working out on the floor.  so i threw it away.  she then asked me why i did that and i told her where do you want me to stick it up my ass?  i could have bought a cd today, but NO!!!!!  i will be patient and exact my revenge on the fat bellies of those who  horded 15 dollars worth of candy......

      so last nite, after work, rachel and i went to popscene.  phantom planet was playing there.  the only problem is popscene is not that big and it's the only club in the city that is 18+.  can you say crowded and crowded with a whole bunch of teenie bopper wanna-be scenester hipsters?  we got there quarter til 11 and the line was more than a block long.  the only cool thing about standing in line was having these two really cute british boys stand behind me.  listening to their accents was so hot, but then this cheap taudry blonde bimbo starts talking to them.  she had the most annoying conversation topics.  it was awful.  rachel was being loud and said she acts like british people don't know how to speak english.  we finally got in right when phantom planet came on which was 11:20.  yes we stood in line for over a half an hour.  it was really really crowded.  rachel recognized a few people.  but me being the typical loner stood in a corner (since all the tables were taken) and watched while nursing a cherry coke.  rachel was trying to make the best of it by dancing right next to me and trying to play fooz ball, but i was more preoccupied trying to find someone.  however, i'm sure he was too deep in the crowd for me to find.  time wasn't on my side either considering rachel and i only could find parking on this one street where street cleaning started at midnight.  so we left at midnite.  i didn't get to see him.  rachel was wondering why i was looking around alot.  oh well......   on the drive home i heard the new ryan adams song and it is so awesome.  i need to get that album today when i go to work.

      finished my first week of diet and excercise routine.  the diet didn't go too well.  the only success story i can really say is that i majorly cut out carbs this week.  not a total defeat but not a total win.  damn those quizno's coupons we got at work.  the work out routine though is going well.  didn't pull any muscles and i have actually been maintaining my stamina.  something that i have added to my workout is playing simpsons hit and run.  it is freakin hilarious.  crashing into pedestrians is a way of letting all that tension go.  then again the simpsons is hilarious no matter what type of media.  they really need to start releasing those season dvd's a lot quicker than once a year.  speaking of tension, working at tower is driving me nuts.  but i have to keep it up so i can pay for medical insurance and my return to school.  oh god school!!!!!!  i am really scared about creative writing because how does one grade creativity?  how does one teach creativity?  how does one learn creativity?  i don't wanna have to suffer having someone tell me i'm not a writer.  but i can't live my life in other's opinions.  man i have to work up confidence in a week.........

      so i get up at 5am to get in my workout and it turned out ok.  but it's the first step and i gotta make the second.  i'm not sore which is good, but my abs are hurting me.  i turned off the music off my work-out dvd and worked out to the new explosions in the sky.  kind of experimental rock meets burning calories.  and the diet.....  geeeeeezzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz  i need my carb fillers, but i can't.  protein and plants will be my choice of diet.  good stuff.   good stuff...  and don't think i am doing this for some guy or some group of hipsters. this is all for me mainly because the doc says so.  oh well.  you win some you lose some.  i also registered for classes today: two biology classes and a creative writing class.  taking the steps necessary to get the future i want.  genetic researcher by day.  underground writer by night.  i realize now it's not about the first or last step.  it's about all of them.  so i got to bare it down and see it through.

      just a piece of advice and reminder for myself.  i should never ever ever ever try to make things all about myself.  it's sad and selfish, and i am tired of being sad.  my friend, who shall remain nameless because she doesn't want anyone knowing about it, is considering to have domestic partnership with her girlfriend.  of course this got me thinking.  if i ever do find someone, domestic partnership........then commitment ceremony.....  and then i started thinking about how i would propose....  and where i would have the commitment ceremony.....  and what we would name our kids that we adopt......  and where would we live.......  it's so much.  thank god i don't have anyone right now.  i don't think i can handle the pressure of giving someone that much attention.

      so i opened the store today and a couple hours into working, i get a phone call.  rachel is calling me asking me what song is playing on the radio.  she, of all people, should know that if you try to put your cell phone up to your car radio, there is gonna be interference.  she kept on saying it was some radiohead song she didn't recognize.  so while on the phone with her, i walked over to this stereo we have in our receiving room and turned on the radio.  she told me the song is playing on alice.  so when i get on alice, the song is playing again, "vaka" by sigur ros.  is this fate?  is this a sign?  rachel calls me, and only me, from her car just to find out the title of a song.  however, i scolded rachel for thinking a song in a made up language by a band that has no equal made her think of radiohead.  it's gonna be a good year.....  atleast i'm gonna have to make it one.

      so i have decided to start this journal all over again.  i guess i chose this time only because it's the new year.  i have also decided to delete all my old posts.  why?  1) the journal i am writing now is for me.  looking back on what i wrote before, it seems like i was writing for you the audience.  like everyone else in this world, people seek recognition and validation from their peers which is not a bad thing, but whenever i wrote, i was writing only to get attention.  the posts seemed so superficial and fake.  i was trying to make my life interesting so you can say, "hey this guy's pretty cool...."  i don't want that anymore.  trying to prove yourself when there's no cause or reason to is tiring, sad, and desperate.  i admit when i first started doing this, it was mainly to attract "cool" and "hip" people so i could include them in my circle of friends, but that failed.  now, i realize that it should have never been about them.  it should be all about me.  i know that sounds selfish, but who else is gonna take care of me?  i'm not here to be someone else or to be something different.  i'm trying to be more like me, but after watching the movie l'auberge espangole, who am i?  so this leads me to reason number two.  2)  the only rule i have for myself is no resolutions, just small goals.  resolutions are such a pain because they give a person such high hopes and if they aren't achieved, it sets them up for a major let down.  so to remedy that, i will be setting small daily goals to get by with life.  the cool thing with small goals is they are easy to achieve and if you don't achieve them it not so upsetting like a major new year's resolution.  if you do fail, it's ok because the goal isn't that big and because you don't have to wait another year to start again.  now some might say small goals is small potatoes.  the trick is that small goals add up.  the more you have done; the more you feel accomplished.  for example, it's not about promising yourself that trip to europe in the summer.  it's about promising yourself you'll set aside 50 bucks for a possible trip to europe in the summer.  setting aside 50 bucks is so much easier than planning a trip.  so, small goals i intend to make is each day, i should do something for me.  that way i have more confidence in myself and in my abilities.....  i know this sounds common place, but you just gotta say it in order to get it rolling.  so this journal, won't be designed to please or upset the masses.  it is here for me to be a reminder of what happened and a planner for what is to come.  but it does not mean i am restricting you.  you, the audience, are more than welcome to read, leave your response, and on those struck by lightining twice occasions offer friendship.  how will i know this year will be different?  i don't know.  i just gotta be persistent and consistent.  throw in a little luck as well too.  no matter what i do there will always be hope and disappointment.  i just won't let it be the end of me.  plus today i had a sign or at least i think i did.  last nite, i didn't do anything except for bake cookies and play simpsons hit & run.  since i had to work early today, i slept in last nite.  my alarm is set to go off to the 97.3 alice radio station.  so at 6:45am today, my eyes and ears opened to the sound of "vaka" by sigur ros.  now for those who don't know me, sigur ros is my all time favourite band so much that i am getting their logos tattooed on me.  the first song of the year is vaka.......  divine intervention or the work of human hands?  maybe both?  let's find out......   you are more than welcome to come.........  cheers.

      so i went to see howie day at the warfield tonite.  so i usually go to concerts alone, and i don't mind, but tonite was kinda different.  i guess due to the fact i have had only four hours of sleep in the past 50 hours i have been very irritable.  i admit i did try to look cool tonite but all my plans kept on failing.  especially my pants.  see, last nite i went to the new concert hall the independent.  now apparently the place is so new that the varnish on the benches stained my jeans. GGGEEEZZZZ!!!!!!  so at howie day, i had to suffer seeing all these couples and groups of friends.  BLAH BLAH BLAH  i guess the reason why most people look cool is by association.  freakin bastards.  i admit i felt alone, but atleast i wasn't the dad who had to take his daughter and her friends all the way from pismo beach.  his daughter made him stand in the back of the line while they were all up front.  bitch.  i need a concert buddy.  maybe if chris should move to sf rather than la.  another thing to ruin the night, is that i was forced to decide between going to howie day or gavin degraw.  they both are great, but howie makes me swoon.  he tugs at the heart.  so to make up for the bad start of the day, howie day was fucking awesome.  he did all my songs: collide, numbness for sound, slow down, and a really cool version of madrigals.  his voice just touches me.  and the crowd loved him.  then it again it was a whole bunch of teenage girls screaming to marry him.  there wasn't a poster.  i figured as much.  to get a poster at the warfield, you either have to sell out or have two concert nites in a row.  but when i got to the parking lot, some idiot left their already paid ticket in the machine.  hahahaha...... excellent... lee gets free parking.  vindication is mine.  now i gotta get some sleep so i can wake up early and get in line for dido tickets.

      despite the cold weather, the three over baring indie bands (bleh), the lack of ventelation in the independent, and the fat ass chick who asked if i could move a little so she could fit her fats and her two friends (and i am not talking about her ass cheeks), i went to the newly opened independent (aka justice league) to see canada's the stills.  now over the years canada has yet to produce anything worth listening to.  yes i admit i do have a couple alanis, sum41, our lady peace cd's but there is nothing worth listening to that will last.  forget the hot hot heat.  the stills are fucking awesome.  they have the boyish charm of a u.s. indie band.  thin yet ripped bodies, stylish yet dirty clothes, and scruffy hair.....  oh dear!  then they have the music and lyric talent of a u.k. band via echo and the bunnymen and the cure.  the venue was cool.  it wasn't too big or too small.  however if they trying to pull the home depot look, they achieved it with the visible plywood and make shift bars.  but it was cool that the seating benches were elevated some what.  those stills boys are so amazing.  their musical technique and style is so awesome.   i am still in love..........   and the lead singer is so fucking hot.  i could just imagine myself rubbing up against him feeling his hot breath on my shoulder.  hot damn.  god the show was so freaking amazing.  i swear if it wasn't sold out and packed, i would have been dancing around all over the place.  just for future reference to the independent, 1) work on the ventelation.  two fans in that big room is just not going to cut it.  2)  if there are three opening bands, don't start the show at 9pm.  try an earlier time.  i didn't get out til close to 1:30am.  and now i have to be up in four hours to get ready for work.  woe is me.  but boy did i swoon tonite.

      is there a word for the phobia of people?  apparently it is called sociophobia, and i think i have it.  today, well actually yesterday, or more like just a few hours ago, i went to the mint, that god forsaken karaoke bar, because it was maggie's birthday celebration.  everyone and there mama was there, and i had to sit in the middle of it.  i don't know what it is, and i don't want to sound like a whining bitch.  despite being a loud and happening hip place, all i could hear was my heart beat and my own breathing.  i find people so intimidating even if i know you or i don't.  i don't know what to say to people.  i just shrug my shoulders and move on.  the highlight of the nite other than maggie's show stopping song, was the cute british guy singing a take that song.  supposedly he was straight.....  yeah right....  but anyways back to my point...  being around people frightens me beyond belief.  do i need a pill?  do i need therapy?  who needs those things when you have a free public blog?  i wish things were different, but they're not.  oh well.....  i guess you'll always be catching me with head phones around me ears and a book in my face.

      so today is my birthday, and now i am a quarter of a century old.  i try not to celebrate on the actual day of my birthday.  i like being left alone of this day only because on your birthdays, you're kinda forced to reflect upon what you've done in the past year.  i find it hard to reflect and place face to friends and family at the same time.  so forgive me if i kinda gave you the brush off today.  i just wanna be left alone.  even my friend daniel, who lives in england, noticed how i never really mention when my birthday is.  i've reflected but a good thing is there is nothing i really regret.  you only have one life so what's the point of regretting.  you'd your chance and now it's done.  i'll still celebrate but on another day.  hello march 7th everyone....  i'm not trying to be the sad depressing leave me alone to die kind of person.  i just want to face the facts on my own terms.  and i am not trying to be some philisophical guru who's looking for enlightenment.  i just want it to be another day.  i don't like defining life with epiphanies and monumental moments.  i want things to flow.  celebrations are nice, and i do want them.  i just want to celebrate my birthday day my own way.

      yesterday, tammy, linda, and myself went to the roxie for the last day of the sf indie film festival to see intermission.  i would say rachel and kelly went too, but typical rachel always seems to screw up everything.  i tell her to tell her girlfriend back in januaray to buy tickets during the presale in the first week of feb.  then last week, rachel tells me she and kelly want to go to the prince concert that same nite.  like she was gonna get tickets.  whatever.  so then she changes her mind again to come with the movies to us.  i told her to get there early so she can be first in line to get a pair of the left over tickets.  she passes by and only see a couple of people in line so she and kelly decide to go to the bar and have a drink.  by the time i get there, the line is HELLA long, so i call her.  she was like ok i will be right there.  so TWENTY minutes later, she shows up.  i just have my back to her while i talk to linda and tammy.  so then she gets in line and we have to save seats.  however, in order to determine how many tickets to sell for those waiting in the other line, they have to see what seats are left.  i got so embarrassed because a guy on the microphone kept harassing me about the seats i was saving, but i was conviently on the phone.  she eventually got in, but she and kelly had to sit in the front.  i swear to fucking hell if she ruins another event i will either punt her ass back across the fucking bay or throw a large rock through her wind shield while she is driving away.  and as it turned out kelly didn't even know that i asked rachel to ask kelly to buy tickets for the presale.  as for the movie it was awesome.  although i needed sub titles for the heavy irish accents which are really hot, the movie was fucking hilarious.  nothing extraordinary and no major dilemmas.  just plain people in the chance circumstances which makes it more hilarious.  colin ferrell is so hot in such a dirty way.  he was such a dirty bird in the movie.  but the mr. beautiful award has to go to cillian murphy.  oh he is the irish version of the guy from smallville but hotter.  when you see his eyes all you can do is sigh.  although i really need to find out what the hell is brown sauce.

      so last nite at work, right around 9:50pm, all of us were around the front counter waiting for the last of the customers.  i then saw this really cute boy walking around with his friend.  i noticed that he was holding the new coral cd, and i was like whoa this boy's got taste in music.  so me and my sneaky ways decided to play the new coral cd when techinally we shouldn't be playing music after 9:30pm.  so i move over to the second register reading the sleeve for the cd while the music was playing.  he finally got in line with his friend who is really cute too.  he then started watching me reading the sleeve and asked me about the album.  and then oh my gosh!!!!!! the boy has an accent, and i realize he's british.  typical short blonde hair blue eyes thin indie british boy.  and his friend was the typical semi long shaggy brown hair tall indie british boy.  we started talking about the coral and how he saw them in reading or t in the park.  and then i talked about how they were gonna be playing soon.  i asked if he saw them a couple years ago and he said he just moved here in august which suggest he must be going to school at state.  god i have become so desperate!  me and my sneaky tactics!  but british boys man i can't resist them.  those damn accents.....

      so yesterday, i was out of control with my music hunger.  i went to five different record stores in one day mainly lookin for one cd (the first snow patrol album).  first i stopped by tower to pick up the new melissa etheridge (only for that one song, plus it was less than ten bucks with my discount) and the american release of the coral "magic and medicine".  i bought that cd almost a year ago as an import but the american release has the new album added to it (double cd for the price of one).  i then stopped by virgin downtown.  i was looking for imports but they didn't have anything i wanted.  they did have alot of cool ben sherman clothes, but of course, i don't fit medium sized clothes.  then i barted over to berkeley.  first i went to mod lang.  spent close to forty dollars in cd import singles: two veils cd singles, an open single, and a hope of the states single (FIND OF THE DAY).  then i ventured over to lovely rasputin's but they had nothing i wanted.  hope skipped over to amoeba and found a strokes fillmore poster.  so in all, i spent close to 100 bucks, and i didn't even find the cd i wanted to begin with.  i have to order it online now.  then today i find out tickets for dido and the strokes go on sale on sunday.  so that means i have to go to amoeba in san francisco and sell cd's just so i can have money to buy tickets.  and i found out the coachella line up.  not only are they gonna have radiohead, the cure, the flaming lips, and THE PIXIES, but uh hello mogwai, howie day, cooper temple clause, ash, 22-20's, the stills. brmc, and for the first time in the states after 3 albums: MUSE.  problem is today tickets are gonna be like 145 bucks and i would have to drive down there and stay at a hotel.  and the heat is gonna get me bad.  i don't think i can do it.  it would really throw a big wrench into my plan to go to london to see embrace, and i can't risk losing that opportunity.  i am soooo crying inside.  god i am such a concert whore...... oh why?  oh cruel fate?  why can't freakin san francisco have a freakin festival.  oh since i am tired, i can't elaborate, but today at work, i almost killed this metrosexual punk ass bitch customer and nearly got killed by this gangsta wanna be thug less than 18 yo punk.  i am too out of control.

      so tonite or last nite, whatever, starsailor came along and rocked my world.  first of all it was a real show with the glitz and glamour.  however it was wasted at slim's.  they had really cool light effects that made their set even better.  a light show like their's could have been better suited at atleast bimbo's or great american.  this time i did not spend the concert alone.  i was with paul and stephan, the kolsanoff brothers.  almost like the brothers who made the matrix except stephan wants to be a rock star as opposed to his brother wanting to be a director.  back to starsailor, man james's voice is so fucking awesome.  in every song, his voice just booms and it always seems like it's going to crack but it never does.  now that is freakin talent.  i do despise the fact he is younger than me.  what i seriously love about british guys other than the fact they are british and have hot accents and are really hot, they never seem to give a fuck.  every show i have been to, where it is a british band playing, someone always walks on stage smoking a freakin cigarette.  even though the show rocked, fans never cease to amaze me.  people just push their way through when their is no way and plant themselves in front of me.  the worst part it is usually tall guys or loud obnoxious girls.  i vow that if anyone should get in my fuckin way.....they're gonna get it.  especially the girl next to me screaming like a banshee.  it was a frequency i swear most dogs could hear.  i was gonna reach in that bitche's mouth and rip her voice box out.  other than that the concert was wicked.  i need a british guy.

      yesterday, at work, as soon as i clocked in, rachel needed to talk to me.  i thought it was about the customer i had a fight with the night before, but apparently, it was something more severe.  either today or in the coming week, tower records is going to file chapter 11.  now for those of you who don't know this, chapter 11 is basically bankruptcy.  now, don't think that tower record stores are all closing in the next month liquidating their stuff.  that is chapter 9.  basically chapter 11 is a slower process.  now the reason why we are filing chapter 11 is because our loans did not get extended, a loan of 110 million.  what is most likely going to happen is that the banks will take over and send out auditors.  the auditors will evaluate the whole situation from the corporate office to every retail store.  some stores will get shut down only because they either really small or make no money whatsoever.  my store is borderline on the chopping block, but i think it has about two years left in it.  once the bank has done its job, what might likely happen is that a company will buy tower and convert it to whatever.  so here are my options.  i could stay and see what happens, or i could move on.  the problem is i love this job.  i have been here six years from when that store was seriously booming through the advent of digital music and the cut prices of wal mart and target.  i am witnessing the end of the music/video retailer.  it is all going to be distributed between the independent stores and the mark down stores.  i would love to work for an independent store but there are no real benefits there.  and the mark down stores, i do like shopping in but i can't imagine myself working for target or wal mart or borders.  can you believe this?  just right now and mean right now as i am writing this, my dad called asking if i still had a job because he got the news that tower is filing chapter 11.  oh geez......  i'm so bummed out.  i'm gonna have to start buying things on amazon.  oh well, as for a job, what in the hell am i going to do?

      so after work today, sarah, with some almighty power behind her, got me to go with her to see "you got served."  the really sad part about this rendevous is that i liked the god damn movie.  the acting sucked like hell, but those dance moves.........DAMN......  i didn't know people could freakin move like that all slow mo matrix style in fast contortions of the body.  when did break dancing come back into style?  i am so behind...  i think i needed a translator for that damn movie.  i could have sworn the phrase was "off the hook" but in that movie they used "off the chain".  again i am getting too old.  that movie had too many choice moments.  of course in a movie about the hood, someone's gotta die, there is always that hoochie mama girlfriend with the t-shirt that has her face airbrushed in the back, the white boy with the bad hair cut who swears he's black, drug dealers, and a sassy pants big momma.  but the dancing........DAMN.......  i wanna dance like that.  but sadly i don't think the shape that my body is in will allow me to defy gravity like that.  i swear they must have used computer animation to pull that dancing off.  however, i will settle for playing bass in a semi cool cover-band.  sadly, when this crap movie comes out on dvd, i will most likely buy it.  see, i'm not one of those snooty hipster movie geeks who can only appreciate the seriously mundane.  god get over it.  it was really cool hanging out with sarah.  will most likely do it again next monday, but this time i pick the movie.

      trying to fight off the cold rain and my fatigue, i went to the cooper temple clause at the independent.  the ticket literally had the phrase "8pm-9pm" which means i wasn't sure what time to show up.  i showed up at seven and of course doors didn't open til after eight.  so can you just add the lead singer of calla to lee's list of musicians i want to be romantic with.  calla was so freakin awesome.  the mogwai-esque music with these ethereal harmonized vocals.  they are an adorable indie band, and i got convinced into buying an album.  everyone go listen to calla.  it's not boring, and whatever you hear on the disc is nothing compared to what they can do live.  they're kinda like sigur ros but in english and not as perfect (because no one can beat sigur ros).  the cooper temple clause, six very hot english lads from reading (the dirty indie kinda hot), were awesome.  never had i ever seen two keyboardist rock like the two in that band.  the crowd was good, except the show didn't sold out.  they said they liked the west coast audiences because they are a lot nicer, but i wished our typical san francisco audiences would let loose more.  a majority of the people on the floor just bobbed their heads.  there was this one guy dancing around kicking a garbage can.  i of course wasn't dancing because i am too old for that.  so i sat down.  but they were freakin amazing.  everyone who is reading this....buy their albums.  it is worth it.  if you would like a listen stop by the tower records in stonestown where we have them on a listening station (my rock over london listening station).

      now, i'm sure you're expecting a post about how i was a good little boy and went to work and worked out and studied and this and that blah blah blah...  today was a bit different.  first let me start off saying that target is such a death trap for my wallet.  i originally went in to get a replacement bulb for my light in my room (which as it turns out was the wrong size), but i also walk out with fairly odd parents action figures.  so what?  i'm a sucker for cartoons.  but anyways later that day i found myself in a situation where i might have to pled the 5th in that i might incriminate myself.  so i will be really vague on the details.  it was very exciting.  some how i stumbled upon a "can store" with a particular "club" in the basement.  now i am not a part of this "club" because i am not authorized to use their "medicinal products."  inside, it was everything i expected it to be: oriental rugs, lights, glass, stuff.  and one of the counter guys is seriously cute and quite possible gay because he was wearing diesel jeans.  no straight man wears diesel jeans.  i never thought i would be in such a place, but i was.  i took in everything i could learning as much as could, but i did not participate in any of the consumption.  all i can really say is that it was crazy.  if you want the details, just ask.  aol: midniteson21   catch you laterz peeps.

      i know it's been a while.  it's just that i really have nothing to say.  i've been trying to write my book but i really hardly want to share that.  i know i was whoring around my first chapter, but as to premise and intention, i have been keeping that such a secret.  but if you should need a tagline: "in high school (and in life over all), you have the elite and you have the rejects.  there are people in middle, and they have stories too.  at least they hope so."  isn't that such a great tagline?  well, f--- you..... who asked for your opinion anyways?  oh wait i just did....  lately i have been singing along to songs about break-up and unrequited love which is strange because it is not really directed in anyone.  i have no reason to sing them, but i just do.  i've been mainly listening to the latest howie day, but no need to worry.  i will be back into sorts considering the new sigur ros is coming out on tuesday.  i did find out today how much my tax refund is going to be.  it looks like i am getting a little over a grand.  i could go on a shopping spree, but i know that's not going to happen.  i was seriously considering putting a major dent in my credit card debt, but i think i am handling that well considering i work full time now.  i still can't believe i am writing checks out for 100 and sometimes 300 dollars.  but i think i have decided on that i will be just letting my money sit in my savings.  because if you look at it, a good chunk of that is my round trip ticket to london.  i am getting method man tickets but i did just get paid.  sadly this whole trip is based around one band.  and strangely it is not for sigur ros.  maybe if i play my cards right, it could be a one way ticket...

      this past sunday was just another reason why i should have started drinking, but i didn't.  how do i handle it all?  first, i was suffering from a major case of dillusions of grandeur because i was celebrating my birthday that day, almost three weeks after the fact, and my idiot friends fell for it.  they even said happy birthday through out the day.  i should celebrate my birthday more often each year.  so first, linda, tearania, and i had tickets to the most sought out event: disney on ice princess classics.  you know you are all jealous.  first we got food and i got a beast plush doll from this really cute sales guy along with the other cute sales guys.  of course the cow palace was filled with little girls in princess costumes and their families.  there was this one boy in front of us who is so gay only because his mom got him a toy and it was the little mermaid ariel doll.  CAN YOU SAY GAY!!!  the show was so exciting especially when the skaters scrubbed.  the guys who played prince charming and prince phillip were so hot.  i didn't even know mulan was considered a princess.  i think my friends and i were the only ones who were really excitied about the show.  and i quote myself,"DISNEY FUCKING ROCKS!!!"  then after the show the drama comes.  everytime, there is some huge outing with a whole bunch of tower employees there is always drama.  first of all i had to keep the party secret so certain people wouldn't find out.  now after the ice show, i get a phone call from marcella saying her and gloria are not coming because they were breaking up and that marcella was kicking gloria out of the apartment.  GGGEEEZZZ!!!!!  so when me and my harem of13 women and paul show up at the restaurant, everyone was like where's marcella and gloria.  and of course i had to hit them with the news.  i freakin rearranged this entire party just so they could come, and now they are not coming.  so the dinner party was at buca di beppo.  the food was great, but the waiters were even greater.  our waiter was named aaron and he looked like sean williams scott but hotter.  tea got a picture of him, and i am still waiting for the picture.  we gave him a 50 dollar tip and i wrote my phone number on the receipt.  the host was really hot too.  i swear you can balance a tray on his ass.  and there was this waiter who looked like rufus wainwright.  can you say so adorable?  even the guy who had to clean our table was hot.  boy am i being forward and horny...... whatever...  i gotta go back again.  after that, we all went bowling, even though only six of us bowled (cheap punks.... i need a richer class of friends)(i am just kidding geez can't you take a joke.  i swear i need funnier friends)(i'm just kidding again.  take a chill pill.  well more like chill pills and pain killers).  the highlight of that part was maggie's bra glowing in the dark under her shirt under the black light.  it was hilarious.  man it was a great day, and if i had drank i probably wouldn't remember it.  anyways, i really love my friends.  they are so great.  MUCH LOVE TO YA ALL....

      on thursday, matt nathanson came into the store to do a walk through.  my co workers and i fawned over him.  he's so adorable.  he signed cd's and posters and took pictures with us.  i will post my ugly but funny picture with him sooner or later.  but anyways we were all talking about how music gets promoted out there.  he said without dawson's creek, it is hard for the singer song writer to get promoted.  i responded with my well there is the o.c.  but on the o.c. most of the music is hipster indie bands like the shins, rooney, turin brakes, the doves, etc.  of course matt was like i'm not really like those bands.  so then my co workers and i suggested one tree hill only because we knew gavin degraw in on that show.  matt and the universal rep said they could add me to the guest list for the concert tonite, but humbled, i said i couldn't make it because i was going to another concert.  of course matt needed to know who was stealing his fan.  i told him it was rufus wainright, and then, matt said i don't know who's gonna perform at slim's on saturday because i want to see rufus at the fillmore.  so fast forward to tonite..... i have never seen rufus live and worse, i actually have never heard a song by him.  so this was a risk on my part, but now  i know what all the hype is all about.  so let me summarize...  songs in french (i'm sorry french canadian), a band that not only plays instruments but all of them sing backing vocals, two back up singers that not only sing but play intruments (shannon mcnally and joan as police woman), intros similar to those in vh1 storytellers, a song about river phoenix, a tale about an art teacher, wishes to be a man, a whole bunch of sexual ineuendo, song about gay marriage, theory about how the second show is always better, song about toppling bush, sweaty ears and towels, stories about jockstraps, capes and witch hats, a couple of covers, three encores, my first concert poster of the year, and camp all around.  i admit i didn't know when to go ape shit over the popular songs, but the crowd was really awesome and i think it really affected the show.  this show was hilarious and crazy.  well not as crazy as flaming lips.  even though i went to the show alone, it was still amazing.  MAN!!!!!  rufus is so fuckin great.  what have i been missing?  well for matt nathanson and all those who missed the show or find my description really vague, don't fear.  they were filming this show.  looks like there's gonna be a dvd come to stores near you.....

      saw the rapture and b.r.m.c. at the grand ballroom last nite.  can we say a really nice venue?  smaller than the fillmore but bigger than great american music hall.  amber, maggie, sabrina, katey, marcella, and i sat in the balcony and it was a really great view.  the crowd was really great despite being a live 105 i only listen to whatever is on the radio crowd and i am too cool to be talked to leaning against the wall hipsters.  although some of the guys at the concerts were HOT, especially the blonde guy with the blue jacket and pierced ears.  damn me, amber, and sabrina could not stop looking at him.  what estounded us the most was that he went to the concert alone?  anyone that hot, straight or gay, can get any fool to pay for a ticket to hang out with them.  rapture was so damn energetic and their dance moves are amazing.  b.r.m.c. did an awesome set.  the last song in the encore, b.r.m.c. and the rapture did a song together.  and of course i wanted to sleep with each of the band members because they were so HOT.  despite being surrounded by hot guys, i get a lap dance from marcella.  and can you say this girl gets crazy when she has had a few drinks.  i have to admit the girl has moves, but her boobs were totally up in my face and i don't mean like inches away.  i mean IN MY FACE.  the girl even bit me twice: once in the thigh, and you can see the lipstick mark on my jeans, and once on the ear, and boy did that one hurt.  the only reason why i was holding her hands was so that she doesn't tip over the balcony.  that girl is too much.  afterwards we went to tommy's joint which is a great after concert spot.  bbq beef sandwiches and potato salad.

      last nite, the grand damme of brit mod indie music decided to go to his first rap concert.  (and yes i am that self-centered to refer to myself in the third person)  method man at the fillmore was so freakin awesome.  the first act was cool.  they kept it short and sweet.  the second act is not worth my time even mentioning.  all i could say is that i kinda feel asleep during this time.  so boi blue (aka method man and i call him boi blue cuz every time i see him, he is wearing blue) came out and took command of the crowd.  he of course said frisco has the best weed.  he loves playing to the crowd, and i was just mesmerized.  in between his songs or is it raps, i don't know, well anyways, he'd talk about his "group", wu-tang, and his partner in crime redman.  i thought he might be on the outs with redman cuz redman left def jam and started his own label.  i wasn't sure to clap or scream between songs cuz i can't really scream and not many people were clapping.  even though this is the first rap show i went to, method man is right.  and i quote,"ain't nobody rock a mother fuckin stage like i do!"  he and the couple guys with him on stage were throwing all the towels, water bottles, t-shirts, and stuff into the crowd.  he was also stage diving and doing flips into the crowd.  he took down the motha fuckin hizzouse.    i was accompanied by the lovely sarah and the lovely bernadette, who both dressed so cute that nite.  i brought bernadette to the show, but it was stephan who bought the ticket for her.  bernadette's boyfriend, paul, was there, but he didn't know that bernadette was gonna be there.  it was a little surprise for him.  even though we showed up 30 minutes for the doors opened, we were like 20th in line.  and me, sarah, and bernadette got to sit up in the balcony.  we all loved the view.  but of course for those of you reading, if lee is not going to a concert alone, there is always drama, and that is why you come on to read this.  so stephan went to the show with his friends.  even though i know he's straight, he looked hot with his wife-beater and cargo shorts.  i'm not prowling.  i am just admiring.  so anyways, he went with three other "friends".  he said hi to me and bernadette, but he said he was gonna stay on the floor with his friends.  after the second act, bernadette noticed stephan moving from the front of the stage towards the back in an incoherent way.  she pointed him out near the sound board.  when i looked, i noticed how he was sitting on the floor.  i told bernadette to text him that if he wanted he could sit up here with us.  we asked him if he was ok and he said he was fine.  he came up, and as soon as he sat down, this lady came up to him and asked him if he was ok.  he said yes, but the lady said six people saw him pass out and that when he was walking up the stairs disorientated.  apparently she was a nurse for the fillmore.  he kept on saying he was fine, but then he turned to bernadette and asked if she saw him fall.  i gave him water, and i told him that if he didn't feel ok i would take him home right then and there.  but he said he was fine.  when method man was doing the whole stage diving and throwing things, i looked at stephan it kinda seemed like he so wanted to be down there.  i felt so bad for him.  bernadette kept on checking on him making sure he didn't pass out on the chair.  it seemed like he had a good time by the end of the nite but he seemed out of it too.  what really pissed me off the most was that his "friends" didn't seem like they cared.  i mean if he did pass out on the floor, none of his friends helped him to the back of the fillmore or even check on him during the show.  and yes i know there is that whole machismo i need to look cool attitude among straight guys, but fuck!  even if i said i didn't need help, it would be nice that people showed their concern.  at the end of the show, when we were outside, i thought i would be driving him home, but he waited for them, left us, and went with them.  i swear if i bumped into them that nite i would've thrown down and knocked out a couple of jaws.

      for all those who haven't seen kill bill vol. 2, i suggest you not read this because i might reveal some things.  so be warned.  so i saw kill bill vol. 2 with linda tonite, and tammy would have been there if she wasn't so elitist snob against poor gangsta wanna-be thinking their all that self centered badly dressed bad attitude nasty ass grilled teeth loud ebonics speaking closed minded filipinos.  well, not all that but some of it.  so of course, linda and i were joking around that jon roberts would be there, and low and behold, who is there at the same theatre watching the same exact movie at the same exact time?  jon freakin roberts.  i said hi, and linda did unlike the time when we saw the return of the king.  so kill bill vol. 2.  i know why he seperated them is because vol 2 is a completely different type of movie than vol. 1.  it is still a great movie, but different.  there were only two fight scenes.  both were good, but only one was up to par with the last movie.  and hello tarentino left it soooooo open for a sequel, but i believe it is going to be this huge cross over between vic vega, vincent vega, jackie brown, beatrix kiddo, and the two main characters of his next two movies.  it will be genius with the one liners and action sequences and homage to 70's cinema.  and poor robert.... it is his first nite closing by himself at tower.  i would come in and help, but i gotta open and buy concerts tickets for a special gig even though i might end up going alone.  oh well.  fuck people.  they don't deserve me.  i should be a killer.

      yesterday, my mom got into a car accident in the morning.  i was the first to respond and get to her.  it wasn't that bad but her car is totaled and the woman she hit was injured.  my mom has been going through a lot of stress and has been feeling some back pain.  all i can really do is be there, help her with whatever she needs, and listen.  every time someone has a crisis, i am usually just there to listen and be there.  oh my god.  i don't know what i can do.  i don't know why people turn to me.  just to let you people know, i do put on a face and try my hardest to be there.  it's hard looking and acting indifferent, and even harder looking like things are fine.  sometimes i just want to close my eyes and sleep while i am in the middle of doing something.  i just want to shut down.  but don't let this discourage you because i will be there.  no matter what the crisis.  just don't expect me to provide a solution so quickly.

      so the strokes was last nite, and boy was it a nite.  first i got there at 3:30 because i knew there was going to be a line.  however i was fifteenth in line.  can you believe that?  so to waste three and half hours, i was writing in my little book about my book.  i think i have a good outline as to how my second chapter is going to be.  also to entertain me were the antics of the other fans.  i like watching the idiots who were the band's t-shirt the nite of the show and watch their reaction when they see another person walking by with the same exact t-shirt.  what is the matter with these people?  god, wearing the band's t-shirt at the concert is the biggest concert fashion faux paux you can do.  the best shirt i saw was this guy smoking wearing a t.a.t.u. t-shirt.  it didn't stand for the band.  it stood for teens against tobacco use.  so kai tai and her boyfriend dave show up with pizza (yum!!!!).  so the concert.  it was freakin awesome.  we got a really good spot at the warfield, and thank god we weren't in the pit with that crowd.  girls were fainting and guys were actually moshing.  i don't think i could ever survive that in that crowd.  the ravonettes were cool but the guy seems like one of those guys in high school who was picked on because he was indie and had all that unrequited love stored up in for the girls he could never have and the chick was his best friend who couldn't be a possible girlfriend just a friend.  oh and by the way, boys wearing small scarves around their neck, that is so gay.  the strokes were awesome.  i loved the setlist.  it was amazing how they didn't even play 12:51.  julian let the crowd decide between 12:51 and a clash cover.  we all chose the clash cover.  they were all drunk.  not wasted drunk though which is good.  while julian was crowd surfing someone grabbed his sack.  kinky.  fabrizio is so hot.  the crowd was awesome too, but can someone explain to me why one out five guys at the show looked like they belonged to the band.  you don't know how many strokes juniors i saw.  the show got out early.  it wasn't even 11pm when the show ended, and plus those guys never do encores apparently.  so thinking that since the show sold out on the first day of sales, you'd think there'd be a poster.  uh i don't think so.  i was robbed last nite.  freaking warfield.  get with it.  oh and dave is such a music snob.  no more like a super music snob.  i know i'm a snob, but he is major snob.  he categorizes everything and knows everything about everything in music.  oh man i think that pizza is creeping up on me right now.

      so i saw troy yesterday, and i have to admit i did like it.  although orlando bloom...  despite looking ripped and hot... and despite doing a good acting job, he made himself out to be this pussy coward stuck up man whore who i wanted to impale with pike leaving him to be eaten by the crows.  thank god i had better things to look at.  first there is brad, ass and all.  i can do without the long hair but he got the muscles.  then eric bana...  fuck the hulk.  boy got muscles and boy is hot.  i would hate to be helen.  all that bitch had to do was drown herself in the sea.  she could have saved millions of lives but no, bitch couldn't keep her legs closed.  linda was so shaken by her orlando that she made me drive her to tower so she can get the return of the king to restore her faith.  overall it is a good movie, but i suggest matinee prices.  but all them men/warriors.  had to fan myself throughout the movie.

      ok.  today started out ok but ended up fucking amazing.  so work this morning. yeah.  whatever.  then me and maggie to go see dido night number two.  we had tickets somewhere in the orchestra which was ok, but considering the night before we had third row pit, i was not gonna have it whether maggie liked it or not.  so as we walked to the berkeley community theatre, i knew there were gonna be scalpers.  so after two scalpers, forty bucks and the original tickets we bought for the orchestra, we eneded up fourth row pit but more center than last nite.  now i don't normally participate in such behavior, but i tasted the forbidden fruit and i wanted more.  i can't just settle for orchestra after having pit, and i wasn't about to let maggie have it either.  i was well ready to pay seventy dollars for what was gonna happen that nite.  so now i would normally talk about how i have crush a jonathan rice and how well he sings, and how dido is so hot, and how her music just touches me in a way that every song relates to me, and how i feel this emotion where i forget about everything and have this one perfect moment, and how dido is smoking hot and if i were straight i do her to london and back, but no you can read that in the last post cuz i was there last nite and she did the same exact set.  yes i am a concert whore, but it paid off, and i will tell you.  so five songs in, there was some technical difficulty.  so dido says,"oh maybe i should tell a joke.  oh i'm rubbish at jokes."  then she stares over to me and maggie's side of the stage.  dido then says,"i'm glad to see some of you have come back again from yesterday."  so maggie and i assume she's talking to the entire side so we start raising our hands and screaming.  but evidently we were the only ones cheering.  and then the unthinkable happens.  dido smiles, says "ah yes", and points once at maggie and the points again at me.  she says she appreciates us being here againg but that it was kinda pyscho.  can you believe it?  dido called me and maggie psycho.  then she said "yes, you sang along to every song yesterday.  it's scary really that you know the words better than i do.  i looked to you guys for cues.  but much respect."  out of a sold out crowd two nites in a row, dido recognized me and maggie.  and for the rest of the nite, you could tell dido looked to me and maggie and gave us that kind of nod.  and through out the concert i was banging my hand with the rock n roll sign, and the bass player and the keyboardist banged their hands back at me.  see it pays to be a concert whore and pay scalpers.  now you seriously wish you were me.

      so last nite, maggie, kelly, jennifer, jennifer's sister, and i went to dido at the berkeley community theatre.  kelly came kinda in the spur of the moment and for 50 bucks got a really good seat.  she sat near maggie and me in the pit which was about eight feet away from the stage.  first of all i would like to say, how in the hell can i public high school afford a theatre like that?  second, how can you not serve beer at a concert?  damn high schools.  so the opening act.  i was under the assumption aqualung was opening for dido.  and i was really excited about it because i love aqualung.  so music is so great and he's a really really cute guy (not to mention he's british).  however, the day of the concert i find out this guy named jonathan rice was opening instead.  i don't think so!  but when jonathan rice came on stage.  based on looks first, he is one hot mother f'er.  he had the whole indie look going with his tattered jeans, converse all stars, and a t-shirt over a thermal.  then when he talked he had this weird accent, but as i found out later, he was born in scotland but split his time as a kid between the uk and the us.  then when he sang.  oh man. he had this deep rough voice that reminded me of nick drake. it's the kind of music that you would hear when you see two lovers in the rain and it's the type of now or never moment and you see them run off together even though it's pretty obvious they are not gonna make it but they love each other so much.  i think i'm in love.  and where was maggie during the opening act?  why she and kelly after going to the bathroom decided to leave the venue and go to a bar to get beer for 30 minutes.  i don't mind being ditched.  all you gotta do is tell me.  she of course felt guilty, and i of course milked it for all that it's worth.  oh dido.......  you were my first concert, and now this show is gonna rank up there in the top select.  first being so close, i can't but feel that there were times where she stared at me.  she is so good damn beautiful that i think i might have to add her to the list of chicks i might actually do.  and there is this presence about her that is so unique.  she not like all those other female singer/ songwriters.  she has these beats you can't really compare to other females out there.  and whenever i hear her songs, i relate to them so much.  these songs about love, life, and loss.  they are the pages out of my journal and she has turned them into song.  she has the beauty and elegance that is angelic but then there is laid back t-shirt and jeans kinda feel but at the same time this wild girl urban style.  it's weird but cool.  and man her voice has improved.  she has always had a great voice, but she has developed and incorporated slightly that diva volume where she can carry a long ass note.  she did my favourites, and she has an awesome personality.  and being so close i felt i like i was part of the show.  the lighting was freakin awesome.  being caught in the brilliance of a goddess makes me smile.  now i have to go to work having only a few hours of sleep.  wait a minute, i have another dido concert tonite.  you wish you were me.

      on saturday, i took jen, tammy, linda, gwen, art, mickey, and dre to el mansour, this really really cool moroccan restaurant.  the last time i was there was a couple of years ago, but man did they revamp the place.  the atmosphere and scenery is so freakin awesome.  rose water and couches.  couscous and mint tea.  hhhhmmm and meat that tastes sweet.  go figure.  best part of course is when the belly dancer showed up.  i think because the hostess was so infatuated with my nail polish, she made the belly dancer take me out of my seat and dance with her.  and boy did i get my groove on.  i really really want one of those shirts the waiters wear.  they look so comfortable.  yesterday, two customers came in and i really have to show everyone my impression of them so ask me and i will do it.  just a preview of how crazy these customer were:  me: well, the only way to avoid service charge is buying tickets at the hp pavilion. girl 1: hp pavilion?  where's dat at? me: um... that is where the concert is at. girl 2: well fine, i need to go get ready.  it takes a long time of training to understand ghetto.  and believe me i know.

      so monday, as i am simply helping a customer on ticketmaster, i get a "mail waiting" alert.  i thought this was really strange because mail waiting only occurs to tell what on-sales are happening for the weekend and we don't get those til thursday.  and what do i see?  "just added third pixies show at the greek theatre"  that says it enough.  despite it being on my sister's birthday, i am still going.  oh well sucks to be her.  i know i am concert whore.  give me a break.  yesterday, i had to work at closing down the berkeley store, and boy did that berkeley crew look like hell.  they were walking zombies with no direction.  so me and all the other visiting tower employees just stood/sat around gossiping and making mean comments like when we were ripping down these personal drawing off the register, "they don't need this crap.  it's not like it's gonna magically reopen their store."  one good thing was that the guy from bay & columbus was really cute in that dirty trucker classic rock way.  so next week is the last day of classes; however, today when i showed up to my biotech survey class ten minutes late, i open the door to find the class doing the final.  hello!  i know i was supposed to memorize like 40 terms for a final that i thought was happening next week.  thanks to three years of berkeley biology and a photographic memory, i pulled out maybe a B.  by the way peoples, go out and buy the elephant dvd.  one of the best films of last year.  check it out.

      so on tuesday nite, my creative writing professor no matter how hard americans try they cannot pass for a british person.  no matter how hard i try.  and i have proof of that yesterday.  so at noon, i went to the snow patrol in-store at the tower records on bay&columbus.  gary and nathan were the only ones who showed up.  well i guess when you are doing an acoustic set you really don't need drum and bass.  they did shortened versions of a couple of the hits off the new album.  i got to meet them and got an autograph and a photo with the band.  because i was so nervous for some reason, all i could say to them was i have been fan since songs for polar bears.  gary was a bit shocked and said well this must be a long time coming for you.  all i could do was nod and say yeah.  i felt so hot too only because i got to be right next to nathan who is so fucking hot.  speaking of hot, there were a whole bunch of british and irish boys there who were all cute and had hot accents.  and i realized you can't fake the whole british thing.  when you see them, you can differentiate them quickly from anyone else.  man i wish i had that.  and hello?  when did tower bay&columbus get all these cute employees.  how come my store doesn't have cute indie boys working there?  so i went to the snow patrol show at slim's last nite.  alone as usual.  the head of the universal division did invite me to another meet and greet at this club called butter across the street from slim's but i declined.  i told him thanks but i wouldn't be able to make it.  i totally could have gone, but what was i going to do?  being that they're all british, i am sure they would all be drinking and having fun.  and what would i be doing?  just sitting there watching them drink.  but the show was awesome.  they mainly did songs off the new album.  gary did start doing the beginning of don't panic by coldplay and then he said wait a minute wrong band.  this of course is funny to me because i have a tendency of reading too much nme and reading all the comparisons of snow patrol to coldplay.  when they did run, i almost cried.  i really needed someone to hold onto during that song.  they said that we were one of the last stops on the tour, but we were so far the best audience and that we are the only ones who sang along with them during run.  the audience was great composed of your older music snobs, young "bleh" hipsters and scenesters, and a whole bunch of drunken british jocks.  no pins though :( .   they said they are coming back in september so all you who read this (all five of you), go out and support them in the fall.

      so about five hours ago, i got home and fell asleep.  i don't know why i am awake.  so last nite with everyone and their sorry comic book ass went and saw spider-man 2 for a midnight showing.  as usual tea and i laughed it up and had to give our own personal commentary.  i think my ribs are still recovering from the incident. it was a good movie.  toby is soooo hot.  i guess i kinda like that geeky look, but then again there was james franco and he was hot too.  speaking of geeky, i also think sam raimi is cute too.  sadly i also liked the guy who played jameson's son.  by the way for those who are gonna see it, don't miss the spiderman crotch shot at the end of the subway scene.  toby is packing heat. so the movie was about spiderman choosing to be a hero or a normal life.  i think the real choosing is what villian is gonna be in the sequel because they setup for three of them.  spiderman's professor is in the movie, so that results in the lizard.  jameson's son is in it and he eventually becomes venom.  and then we have james franco stumbling upon his fathers stash of weapons so here comes the hobgoblin.  maybe they'll do a trio of villians?  who knows?  so i successfully avoided pride this year.  hey the choices we make.  it's not my thing.  don't get me wrong, i think people should have a good time about their sexuality, but that is just too many people for me.  i would probably have an anxiety attack.  some day i'll go, maybe, i don't think anytime soon.  maybe not ever.  i will probably make it my mission to travel to somewhere during the last weekend of june.  i should put that eighty bucks i used to get my passport to good use.  can you believe that?  eighty bucks!

      so today i was supposed to detox by beginning a liquid diet for the next two days.  i lasted the morning but by the time lunch time came around i felt the need to eat solids.  eric didn't help much considering he wanted to go to mcdonalds and then cinnabon.  well if i'm going off the deep end, i might as well make a huge enough splash.  i'll start tomorrow, but of course the second day lands on work, so i have to be real careful as not to over exert myself.  lately i have been addicted to the killers' cd hot fuss.  it's an awesome record and everyone should go buy it before they raise the price on it.  i like the little blurb the tower p.o.p. has for it.  the vocals of the cure mixed with the dance beats of new order.  pure pop.  it's good pop.  they were at popscene last week.  of course i didn't go considering what happened at the muse event at popscene.  reminder two venues to avoid seeing a band: popscene and cafe du nord.  the only reason why i don't like cafe du nord is 1) the stage is too low so if you are in the back good luck in seeing the band and 2) no ticket stub.  yes damn it!  i am a collector.

      so my band, one of the eight sons of radiohead and verve, has come out of hiding and annouced major news with a new website.  embrace will be releasing a single on august 30th and a new album on september 13th.  as it turns out the new signle was written by chris martin of coldplay.  chris thought it was a good song for coldplay but thought it was a great song for embrace.  he and danny are apparently good friends.  and the new album is being released internationally which is the first time since the release of the good will out back in 1998.  so to celebrate this i am seriously considering seeing them play live on septermber 3rd in london.  will i do it?  i don't know.  i haven't renewed my passport.  since we are on the subject of england, everyday i feel more drawn to that god forsaken country.  i've reading all the news about the euro cup and how badly the england football team is doing.  although this is habit, i am still buying a whole bunch of uk bands.  today my mom told me over 3000 people applied for a job i applied to with social security.  chances are really grim.  if i don't find a job in the next two years, i am seriously considering to relocate to england.  i'm sure daniel could hook me up with a job over there.  the only things really holding me here are my mum, who i love to death, my friends, who i love to death, and the concerts halls (mainly the fillmore and warfield), who i love to death.  speaking of concerts, i need to find someone who is willing to either go to santa cruz or sacramento with me to see hoobastank.  i can't see them is san francisco because it's the same day as jet, and jet is ending their tour with the fillmore.  i can't miss that show.  but i can't miss hoobastank because as it turns out phantom planet is opening for them.  so anyone who wants to go?  i will pay for your ticket and drive.  PLEASE!!!!!!  yes i know i am a concert whore.

      this weekend including today has been a trying yet adventurous one.  on saturday, i had to some how juggle a register schedule when even with a full staff we were going to be short one person and before i could even open the store three people called in sick and a fourth tried to call in too.  but thanks to the help of gloria and tom we had things covered and i didn't have to do any overtime.  no thanks to management of course.  and because there was opening in my day, i had time to make an appearance at the gloria/marcella party.  all i can say it was a crazy party and all the craziness i took a hand in, crazy enough, was with a sober hand.  to my misfortune, i lost my voice the next morning.  angela though is one party animal once she's lost all inhibition.  it's always the quiet ones.    so today, linda and i drove to berkeley to see jason mraz.  now, i'm not a super fan, but the tickets were the right price (free) and god forbid i refuse such a price.  we had tickets: orchestra row k seats 3 and 4.  before i could get to the venue, i had to stop by a couple of stores.  mod lang i bought  the new hope of the states.  i have yet to listen to it but nme gave it a 9.  how can you go wrong?  then next door, stopped by comic relief and bought gay manga.  how can you go wrong?  then next door to that, this new game store but the clerk was rude so i didn't buy anything that day.  but i will be back.  so linda and i went to zellerbach auditorium, the same one i graduated in.  and as it turned out odd seats are on one side and even seats are on another.  i wasn't about to sit this concert alone when i know someone is there with me.  hell no.  i guess it's retribution for the madonna thing.  so linda and i were like fuck it.  can you believe it?  i left a concert.  i think i would have to downgrade my concert whore status to concert harlot.  let's go see a movie.  so picking up tearaina, we all went to see the stepford wives.  freakin hilarious.  everyone should go see it.  i think i will be a stepford wife for halloween.

      since madonna, i have decided to not start over again, but to push harder and take bigger risks.  so many people, when they say they are trying to be themselves, are usually trying to be someone else or trying not to be someone else.  i think that is where the rules of pop and counter culture have been derived.  kids buying into the pop culture are kids trying hard to be like some popular icon out there who's living the life they want.  kids rebelling into the counter culture are those kids trying hard not to be like some popular icon out there who's living the life they hate.  whether it be a conscious or unconscious act, most people are afraid to be whatever their heart dictates.  before they make any action, they typically think about how other people are going to react.  it's a shame.  i'm not saying that i don't do these things because i do.  i just want to be less self conscious and less self aware but alot more determined and alot more tolerant.  we all take from here and there to form who we are, so there is no real cure unless you hide in some cave for the next billion years.  everything is fake and manufactured.  not that it's bad thing.  it's just that there's not an original thought left in this world.  so we gotta make do with what we have.  to be more happy, happy is the wrong word but it's the first one that comes to mind, to be more efficient, i won't necessarily have to re-invent myself.  i will have to play by the rules to get ahead so that when i'm in charge i will change the rules to even out the playing field.  in order for this to work, i just have to remember where i came from.

      today linda, tammy, and i went to berkeley.  it was very strange though i was the one leaving berkeley empty handed.  so tammy and i hooked up with maggie, rachel, and kelly to see madonna at the hp pavilion in san jose. ok i know.  first, it's madonna, and i know it sounds gay but hey i guess that's just me.  ok see i admit it.  i'm gay.  second, it's the hp pavilion, and i have never been there before for good reason.  it's just too big.  but i promised maggie, so i went.  when we get into the pavilion, i begin to breathe hard.  i think i have a light case of social anxiety disorder.  this does happen to me from time to time, but you'd think this would happen to more since i go to alot of concerts.  the deal is at concerts i have something to focus on: the band.  but this place is huge and it is hard to focus.  then when we find our seats, we are all the way in the back of the pavilion last row and the level is so steep.  i thinking i was suffering from vertigo too because i didn't want to move.  rachel and kelly though got to sit in the front row on one of the other upper level sections.  then a miracle happened.  this usher came up to us, and with prior warning maggie knew what to do, she kept on saying she was from detroit and i had asthma.  with that the usher asked for out tickets and gave us new ones.  now mind you, we started out in the back of the hp pavilion in the very last row.  you can't get much further than that.  in fact, rather than take my car, i am sure my seat was walking distance to my house in daly city.  we ended up on the lower level, section 115 row 3 which was about twenty feet away from the stage.  can you believe it?  from the very back all the way to the near front.  my new ticket even says reloc which translates into relocation.  we were close enough to see the muscle cuts in madonna's arms.  essentially i paid maggie 55 dollars for a nose bleed seat to end up with one of the coveted three hundred dollar seat.  i saved 250 dollars.  and all togther the five of us saved over a grand.  poor rachel and kelly though.  they had different seats from us so they didn't get upgraded.  the show fucking kicked ass.  it was this whole spiritual greatest hits thing going on.  highlights were frozen, express yourself, like a prayer, crazy for you, material girl, and her cover of imagine by john lennon which i almost began to tear.  oh god i'm so gay.  one major plus, her dancers are fucking hot.  one of them looked like viggo mortinssen and another looked like mark walhberg.  there were so fucking hot.  i could not keep my eyes off them.  now you seriously seriously wish you were me.  believe me kids, i am good luck at concerts.

      i've have been up since 6am yesterday and it is now past 3am today.  less than an hour ago i saw the new harry potter movie.  despite have been changed around alot and having a great deal of the book cut out, it is a good movie partly because those british boys are so cute.  i know that is bad, so i will just leave it at that.  so how did i pull it off?  mixing red bull with two cokes.  and i am still up.  i think i have gone crazy.  and i gotta be up before 11am so amber and i can go see a franz ferdinand private concert at the metreon.  and then i gotta work 3:30-12:30.  you really really wish you were me.

      other than being the title of the new beta band album which is great, boy did i feel that way yesterday... twice.  first, a new best buy is opening near my house so i figure hey why not apply and see what they offer me.  since the store is in san mateo county, the minium wage there is 6.75, and i of course being a supervisor did not want to take a pay cut.  so i applied for a supervisor/manager position.  so i had to take this online interview thing for them and show up at the interview spot.  so the guy at the interview place asked me my name and my ssn.  i give it to him and he came back ten minutes later to tell me from the results of my online interview i did not qualify for the position applied for.  what fucking nerve?  don't tell me i don't qualify.  i have been offered a manager position twice.  whatever.  to hell with best buy.  anyways i get paid plenty, have a whole bunch of vacation time, and can make my schedule to whatever i want.  bunches of piss ants.  i stomp on you best buy.  i stomp on you.  then later that nite, i went to cafe du nord to see keane play.  the venue i am sorry to say sucks.  it is a great bar, but as a concert venue, it sucks ass.  the stage is too low, the lighting is really bad, and there is really no place to sit.  being an old timer that i am, i need a place to sit.  but keane did make up for it.  a band without a single guitar, and they sounded awesome.  but it was weird really.  they are the biggest thing in the uk.  it is probably to the point where they can headline a place like the bill graham civic auditorium and sell out.  but instead they have to humble themselves and settle for a small as venue that probably holds a little over a hundred people.  americans really need taste in music.  i did get myself a new badge.  they will conquer american.  nme and q did call them the next coldplay.

      so on tuesday, i went to the fillmore to see jet.&nbsp; and just to remind everyone, hoobastank was on the same day at the warfield.&nbsp; and to make things worse for me, tammy calls and says oh the rep dropped off two free tickets for hoobastank.&nbsp; i had to decline, and luckily i did because stephan and christine called me and told me they were going to jet.&nbsp; cool this one wasn't gonna be a loner.&nbsp; of course we ended up in the balcony because it's the best place to be.&nbsp; plus i can't stand for three hours in one place.&nbsp; the opener i slept through, and sloan was cool.&nbsp; jet was so freaking amazing.&nbsp; it's been a while since i went to freaking rock show.&nbsp; although hoobastank was the day before.&nbsp; the lights were really cool.&nbsp; for some reason, when they perform, i think of ac/dc.&nbsp; listening to them play made me wanna get up and start moshing.&nbsp; considering this was the last stop of their tour, they had to go all out.&nbsp; they did my two favourite songs.&nbsp; one of them should have been used to close the show but it was the first song played during the encore.&nbsp; and they are so hot, but the drummer is so fucking hot.&nbsp; he had on this old white roughed up paper thing cowboy hat, a leather jacket with no undershirt, and flared jeans while holding a beer bottle and cigarette.&nbsp; man he was so dirty hot.&nbsp; and to make up for disappoint at the strokes and method man, there was a poster.&nbsp; hell yeah!!!

      i could not have survived yesterday's journey without the help of tearaina and me first & the gimme gimmes.&nbsp; so off we went to santa cruz which was not that bad of a drive except for me nearly hitting another car and those winding roads up and down those damn mountains.&nbsp; right as we get into santa cruz, i look in my rear view mirror and see this guy in his car with an ornament hanging off his rear view mirror.&nbsp; the ornament was a big wooden up side down cross, on purpose.&nbsp; tea and i looked at each other and asked ourselves are we in hell?&nbsp; then we get lost and pull over at a gas station.&nbsp; tea asked the really cute gas attendant with a southern accent for directions.&nbsp; he wasn't the smartest guy though.&nbsp; he was smoking out in the fuel pump area.&nbsp; when we finally found the place and got parking.&nbsp; we decided to walk around downtown which was sad because no building exceeded three floors.&nbsp; so while we are walking around, this "homeless" guys asks us, "can you spare the hate?"&nbsp; i was about ready to throw change at the fucker's face.&nbsp; being in santa cruz, tea and i realized we were the only coloured people who didn't get their colour by tanning.&nbsp; to fit in there you have to have bleach blonde hair in dredlocks, flip flops, boarder shorts, and hemp jewelry.  so we are in line for the concert.&nbsp; this lady is selling hoobastank beenies.&nbsp; this guy behind us screams,"how much?"&nbsp; she says,"ten bucks!"&nbsp; he says,"what a rip off!"&nbsp; she says,"yeah!!! like your mom!!!"&nbsp; then this car drives by and this chicks uses one of those damned loud blow horns thinking it was funny.&nbsp; i scream out,"funny that's the same sound your mom made last nite!"&nbsp; i gave up the warfield for the crappy ass santa cruz civic auditorium.&nbsp; tea and i realized we drove all this way to hear one song.&nbsp; but the show was really good.&nbsp; the first group was actually good for an emo rock band.&nbsp; i like the guys voice.&nbsp; i bought their cd and then went up to the concession stand to be a dick and ask for beer.&nbsp; of course they have none.&nbsp; i just wanted to be a dick.&nbsp; apparently tea and i were one of the few people who were over 21 and not a parent.&nbsp; then phantom planet came on minus jacques.&nbsp; i found out later he left the band to pursue a career in photography.&nbsp; but alex, darren and sam are so hot.&nbsp; and their on stage antics had so much gay sexual ineuendo.&nbsp; then hoobastank came on.&nbsp; i have never been to a rock show like this, and it was good.&nbsp; the lead singer's shirt didn't last long and man is he CUT and kinda hot cuz he's CUT.&nbsp; but of course i couldn't stop looking at the guitar player.&nbsp; he is so hot.  then as we are driving back over the mountains, there was this lighted area in the middle of the forest where three white crosses were shining bright.&nbsp; SCARY!!!!!!!

      let it be known that lee is not an absolute concert freak!&nbsp; two nites ago, i showed up one hour late for a concert.&nbsp; so ha to all of you calling me a freak!&nbsp; i maybe a whore but not a freak.&nbsp; so i went and saw the velvet teen at bottom of the hill.&nbsp; not that packed but i didn't see my brother and i didn't see my co worker.&nbsp; i thought this was a 21 and over show, but when i arrived, i see a whole bunch of black x's on all these cute indie guys.&nbsp; and of course black x's mean under 21.&nbsp; now my brother compared the velvet teen to coldplay and my co worker compared them to early radiohead.&nbsp; as it turned out it was an emo indie show.&nbsp; the opening band i did see called the polar bears was so godly awful.&nbsp; i thought scream-o had died and was buried.&nbsp; then the velvet teen came on...&nbsp; and as it turned out, they are just another emo band.&nbsp; not bad, but not good either.&nbsp; the problem i was having with emo bands was because they don't normally follow the whole verse/chorus routine and if they do it is really hard to find the catchy hook because they are screaming it.&nbsp; and these indie kids fall for it.&nbsp; how the hell can you understand it?&nbsp; and the velvet teen kinda turned me off by saying come on san francisco how come no one is moving around?&nbsp; well in my opinion, which of course matters in most circles, how can you move to emo?  and just another added bonus about indie pretension, there is this co-worker of mine who just exudes pretension.&nbsp; it seems unintentional, but their commentary on everyday things, and believe me they have a comment on everything, just comes of snide and self centered.&nbsp; bleh.....&nbsp; i admit that i have my nose stuck in the air sometimes but everyone knows i'm joking.

      last nite i stayed up until 1am for what you say?&nbsp; because 1am pacific time is equivalent to 9am greenich mean time.&nbsp; and at 9am greenich mean time, embrace tickets went on sale.&nbsp; i bought a&nbsp;ticket for the last show on the opening tour on october 7th.&nbsp; it looks like i am going to england.&nbsp; it is at this really cool venue called the leas cliff hall in folkestone.&nbsp; it's about an hour train ride from london.&nbsp; i'm really freaking out.&nbsp; i have it all planned out if my trip conincides with school.&nbsp; however, if i should get a new job in the next couple of weeks, i'm not sure.&nbsp; my passport should be coming in august.&nbsp; i'll have at least a grand saved up by then and paid off one and a half of my three credit cards.&nbsp; i don't know what i have gotten myself into.&nbsp; i thought i was crazy for buying tickets to see hoobastank in santa cruz, but i must be off the deep end to buy a ticket for a concert in england.&nbsp; what am i doing?&nbsp; i really don't know what i'm doing.

      never in my life would i have ever thought that whole my people will call your people ever happen to me.&nbsp; to make a long story short, one of my idiotic irresponsible cowardly employees who is in a band had his record label call me to ask me if i could let him off work early.&nbsp; of course being the evil vindictive manipulative person that i am, i made this "record label rep" feel so shitty. &nbsp; so i was supposed to be adding more decor to my room by putting up three more bgp posters in my room.&nbsp; however as it turns out three of my new bgp posters are not the standard 13x19 size.&nbsp; they are 12x19 in size which i cannot use because the frames at cheap pete's are specified for the 13x19 size because it is standard.&nbsp; well standard in bgp poster size.&nbsp; as it turns out the three posters are done by the same artist.&nbsp; what a fucking recluse.&nbsp; although the guy behind the counter at cheap pete's was really cute.&nbsp; a taller skinnier version of orlando bloom.&nbsp; his receipt said mark, but his name tag said knowas.&nbsp; weird but really cute.

      i am so stoked.  embrace have allowed their new single, gravity, to be on their website.  i am forever listening to it. it is so amazing.  the song is written by chris martin, but it embrace does it so well.  speaking of new music, the album leaf came out with a new album about three weeks ago.  uh hello?  why didn't anyone tell me.  every track has atleast one member of sigur ros or amina.  funny thing is that it doesn't sound like a sigur ros album.  the album leaf is coming to cafe du nord, but i really don't like that venue.  oh well guess i have to miss out.  i have lately been addicted to the me first and the gimme gimmes.  i can't help but dance to their music.  pop punk covers go figure.  i also got tickets to see the killers at the great american.  i think i should get another ticket for linda when she gets back from vietnam.  i would complain about work, but i'm sure you're bored of that by now...  but who says i won't later!  consider yourself lucky this time.

      fourth of july was just a zombie state for me.  because i closed the night before, opening and having to deal with ernie left me so droopy eyed and feet dragging.  paul and stephan came by to buy stuff as usual.  ernie could help but gawk at the two.  then denna and sergio came by.  sergio is one of the only people i actually miss working with.  just thinking about it reminds me of the old days.  the days tower was cool.  now i have an operations manager lying to me saying we're skipping employee the month for june only to find out later that shock got employee of the month for june.  it's not that i wanted it, but i felt that i should have voted for it.  i was gonna vote for shock this month anyways.  then i find out one of the new employees is opertaions manager's cousin and i find out that one of the other new employees is the best friend of the employee development's best friend.  this store is falling to pieces.  when i go, there is no looking back.

      at the sacrifice of seeing mum, i decided to go see gavin degraw at the independent.  i guess i needed to make up for the fact i missed him back in march when i decided to go see howie day over him.  so there were nothing but yuppie chicks and their boyfriends that they dragged along and premadonna gay guys.  there was this really cool guy that sat next to me.  and don't come to conclusions, he's straight.  however he knew alot about male singer song writers: howie day, gavin degraw, matt nathanson, jason mraz, etc.  of course i was like are you gay, but he totally looked like one of those frat a&f boys.  he was really really enthusiastic about music.  he kept on asking me about concerts i go to and cd's i could reccomend.  apparently he likes looking for those unknown musicians.  it was kinda scary because he knew every word to the songs of one of the opening acts and gavin degraw.  so all three acts were basically white people singing with soul.  mark broussard is this southern boy rocking out in that bluesy way.  he was kinda cute getting all sweaty while strumming to his guitar.  he covered a couple of blues songs.  then toby lightman was again singing in a bluesy way, and she decided to cover mary j. blijge.  then gavin came on.  he was awesome and very hot.  he covered marvin gaye, tina turner, and smokey robinson.  although his set was running long and i have to admit i was getting a bit bored.  then for an encore out of left field, gavin decided to cover a white guy, leonard cohen.  whatever.  and just a little suggestion to all people setting up concerts, if there are three acts, don't start the concert at 9pm.  start it at 8pm.  gavin degraw was putting up a good race to be the latest concert i have been to.  he finished at 1:15am, but howie day still stands as the leader with 1:30am.

      i'm good, but i'm not that good.  yesterday was a very trying day.  i guess i was showing it too considering five people asked me if i was ok.  i almost had a breakdown, and i didn't want it to show.  my days at tower have slowly erroded away at my armor, and i don't think i can continue on.  over six years ago, i was the young eager 18 year old eager to take on the record retail industry.  i guess you could say it was my dream job at the time.  now i am just too old.  i can't be this store's hero anymore.  the battle scars and wounds are too many and too deep.  i had my prime a few years ago, and now i am the old vertran gone decadent and complacent.  running around has now become dragging feet.  i can't carry the weight of my store's problems on my shoulders anymore.  it's going to crush me, but the calls keep coming and coming.  every time i can hear my name called.  i've seen the golden age of the record industry and i have seen it destroyed by the birth of internet downloading.  i've seen music trends go in fashion to faux pax.  i got hired at tower's prime and now it is barely hanging on as a corporation.  and now i'm afraid a new war is brewing and it may cause the closing of my store.  optimists blame 9-11, the usual excuse, but realists blame napster.  i'm not sure if i will see that end of this, but in the horizon it seems evident.  i just wish that when i leave someone will come and save the store from chaos, but in all honesty, i don't see that happening.  i long for the days when tower was fun.  i am the last of my group, and it has been lonely for a long time.  it is time for this old soldier to retire and go into the real world.  the first ship i see, i will take and not look back.  i just hope that those who do remember me, they'll say," remember lee?  what a fucking bastard.  a good worker but a major bitch."

      so to soak in my new surrounding in richmond, i decided during my lunch i will go out to the nearby outdoor mall.  i decided to eat at the kentuck fried chicken there.  and when i get there, the front counter is covered by bullet proof plastic.  you put your money in a slot that has a flap.  i know this area is ghetto; i just didn't realize how ghetto.  so to absorb in the atmosphere, i decided to get strawberry soda along with my meal.  i would have ordered greens and grits but kfc doesn't carry such things.  i really wanted to eat my food there, but i only had a half an hour for lunch so i had to get back.  nothing else much to report other than it is hot as hell over there but cold as hell over here.  i have also decided to limit myself to only one non weekend concert a month.  thanks god a majority of the ones i have are on the weekend.

      so after the first two days of work, i realized something.  i have mighty big shoes to fill.  my mom, god bless her, hasn't worked at the payment center in richmond for almost ten years, but her presence is still known.  from as high as up as the second in command to the guard at the front, they all know the legacy that is my mom.  i was even embarrassed in front of my class when the head for the orientation told everyone how she used to look at my baby pictures.  and this is just added pressure to the ever so many rules and regulations i have to go through.  it is unbelievable as to how many rules and regulations i have to follow.  i guess that's the penalty for working at the government.  it is so bad that i have to change my password every 30 days, and that any unauthorized use of agency equipment from computers to phones can be discovered and tracked within minutes if not seconds.  i'm not sure what i have got myself into.  but i gotta keep on drudging.  looks like the idea of wearing cutoffs is thrown out the window.  hot damn.

      so on friday, i ventured out to first to cingular to upgrade my phone, but not only did i upgrade my phone, but i upgraded my plan too.  i even spent the other nite looking for ringtones for my phone.  can anyone recommend any sites?  then i was only supposed to go to old navy downtown for two pairs of khakis.  i ended up walking out with two pairs of khakis, a pair of jeans, two polos, a short sleeve shirt, and two long sleeves shirts which amounted to well over alot of money.  oh geez i'm a sell out.  next thing you'll know is that i will be order furniture from ikea and moving into a condo in some suburb with a deluxe economy car.  but of course the benefit of that circumstance has a strong chance of ending up in a tyler durden syndrome.  oh well no matter where i go CHAOS!!!!  i'm so excited my brother's kitty is living here.  i love her so.  although she's pretty plump.  you could have sworn that tammy was raising it.

      seriously, the truth is i am not leaving tower.  i know i've been keeping it a secret for the past two weeks.  i just didn't want anyone making a big deal about me leaving because the truth is i am not leaving tower.  i stepped down as senior full time supervisor and have decided to demote myself to simpleton clerk.  the only person i really told was my manager just so he could prepare for my departure.  it was i who recruited sergio and got him the job here and it was i who decided to leave everyone in the dark.  mike and i came up with the idea of me being arrested on my last day for shop lifting.  although there weren't that many people there to see it go down, it was still hilarious to see the reactions of some of the employees.  those hand cuffs were pretty tight, and i didn't realize my fly was open the entire time.  to make up for the mean, cruel, vindictive, malicious joke, i decided rather than go out to lunch with the managers we would use that money to buy pizza for everyone.  HOORRRAAYYY....  lee does something nice for once in his life.  so here's the low down.  i am NO LONGER a supervisor.  i am a clerk who will probably retain all the powers i have inherited while being a supervisor, but i will drive the supervisors nuts by calling them for any little thing when i know i have the power to do it.  i will be working only openings on saturday and sunday.  mainly as the ticketmaster on sale person considering the person we were training quit on tuesday.  i begged, and believe me i begged, to get a pay cut, but the managers didn't feel it right that an almost seven year employee should make the same amount as an employee who just started.  so sorry kids i know you wanted those raises.  katie will inherit the porn section, but i still will be working in the dvd room.  i will most likely keep the imports as well.  as for the new job, i will be working for social secuirty which means government job which means good benefits.  even though it is all the way in richmond, the first year of the job is training which means class room setting.  there is really no dress code, but i think i am going to have to get used to wearing khakis and polos.  and because this is the kind of class room setting, i have to cancel my trip to the motherland, england.  hey it's the price i have to pay.  and on a final note, i am sorry for those of you who took the joke hard.  it was just joke ok.  although i could bust sam for a wrong stop.  but he's cool, so i won't.

      so last nite, maggie and i went to go see the village.  i heard it sucked and maggie heard it was the most amazing thing.  for those of you who wish to see the movie please don't read further because i will ruin it for you.  THE MOVIE SUCKED!!!!  m. night shama-lama-ding-dong is the most self indulgent director out there.  written, produced, and directed by... i am surprised he didn't put also making a cameo appearance.  aaaarrgghhh....  he is one of the few directors who has pigeon-holed himself into a genre of movie thrillers with a HUGE twist.  the big twist with the village was that the monsters in the forest where actually the elders who started the village and the reason why they scare everyone is because they don't people to leave the village.  why you ask?  it's because outside the village, everyone else is living in the modern time.  so these elders who started the village came from modern day society, set up camp in a wildlife refuge, and started a town that believe they are in the 1800's to avoid any sense of evil, crime, guilt, whatever.  and the whole color scheme.  the red... hello can you say scarlet letter anti transcendetalist.  save your money and go see what i wanted to see last nite harold and khumar go to white castle.

      so these past few days and the next coming days are going to be about people who have left my life and show up unexpectedly.  friday, while closing, lei shows up after calling the store earlier.  she told me she was coming in to buy a cd but as it turns out it was also her birthday too.  i can't help but feel that her showing up at the store was for attention.  i don't understand how she can just try to work her way back into my life.  i mean she was the one who wouldn't answer her phone and even had her cousin lie to us for her.  i'm not down with that sort of shit.  don't push me away and then try to draw me in acting like nothing happened.  then on saturday out of no where, chris, my grammar school best friend, and i mean best friend, showed up at work.  i haven't seen him in six years, and that was just for a brief moment.  before that was three years i think.  the problem here is that he just stopped talking to me.  no reason.  no explanation.  no anything.  it hit me pretty hard and i would have to admit it was one of the major contributions for my major mistrust of people.  well he shows up and he is so different from when i last saw him.  i'm not sure but i think he's not mentally all together.  but when he introduced himself to me, i was caught off guard and i couldn't keep the conversation.  all the emotions were coming back and i couldn't handle it.  i almost started crying because there is something different about him causing me to feel pity.  it was just too hard.  and now tomorrow is my dad's birthday.  i'm not sure what to say about it, but ever since he left, i don't know.  i just hope... i don't know.  i really can't stand him right now.
