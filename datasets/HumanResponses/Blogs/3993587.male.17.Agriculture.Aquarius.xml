        She packed my bags last night  Pre-flight,  Zero hour, nine a.m.  And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then.    I miss the earth so much,  I miss my wife.  It's lonely out in space  On such a timeless flight.    And I think it's gonna be a long, long time  Till touch down brings me round again to find  I'm not the man they think I am at home.  Oh, no, no, no,  I'm a rocket man,  Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone.    Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids,  In fact it's cold as hell  And there's no one there to raise them if you did.    And all this science,  I don't understand.  It's just my job, five days a week,  A Rocket man.      I'm very sorry.

      MWAHAHAHAHA. This is my first post. I hate being not at the beach. So, anywho, Dr. J has up and left, and now there is no one  to cure my ills.  I  saw a Brett at a rest stop  on the way home.  Nearly shat myself. I hate Bretts. I asked for some of his refreshing beverage to wash down my tasty burger, but he told me to go fuck myself. So I said, "Brett, you are most definitely NOT a smart motherfucker," and proceeded to bust at least 10 caps in his sorry white ass.  Anyways, i'm sitting at my computer, currently listening to "A Day in the Life" by the Beatles. Its trippy. And i'm also talking to alissa. she said she'll be right back. She's back now. So anyways, David, get your sorry as down here. I need a drinkin buddy.  And someone to pick up chicks with. Wait a minute, what chicks??? There's chicks in Canada? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit. Now i'm listening to some floyd. Young Lust. Ooooooooooooooooo..........I need a dirty woman.  I really do. Like, fuck man. Its raining cats and dogs outside. Where the hell did that expression come from? I mean, what the hell. Raining cats and dogs??? Why the hell not sheep and llamas. This calls for some affirmative action.  I mean, if several Mexican Whooping Llamas can't get the same treatment as a couple of mangy cats and dogs, then what will become of the North American Spotted Llama!? Won't someone please think of the children. For the love of Jebus H. Christ. I believe the "H" stands for Harold. I'm no listening to Ode To Joy, I'll tell ya, the change in mood can almost kill a man. You wanna know why i'm listening to it? because i'm a cultured sunnofabitch, that's why. I sip whiskey, drive a bently, and hate network televison. Now there's some crazy latin shit in the song. Why? because latin's cultured. Yes yes...now i believe i'ma set as spell on the veranduh and have the slaves whip up some mint julips. What the hell is a mint julip? Is it like a tulip? except more "j" and less "t"? Now back to some floyd. From the wall, guaranteed to pick your spirits up. Well, it beats peter frampton. i hate that man. yet i can't stop listening to show me the way. oh fuck, i need a drink. i'm gone          Will batman escape from catwomans claws? or will that feline feind's revenge be the cat's meow????     Find out, same bat time, same bat channel!!!

      So, whats with those damned grizzlies? Those stupid brad lookin mother fuckers tried to roll up in our surf like its their own turf. They got confused, stupid cheese dicks. By the way, www.ronharris.com is the shit. Anyways, back to the ranting. So, the other night, some stupid bitches rolled up to the clubhouse where me and that godamn canadian were hangin out, right? You with me, keep up, son. So then these other bitches came over and were like "hey bitch, we the bitches around here, bitch." So i just sat back and watched the show. When the clothes started gettin torn off i got excited.... i ran as fast as i could home and grabbed the video camera and the girls gone wild t-shirt and ran back. On the way back to the clubhouse, i didnt forget to bring some buckets of mud for them to wrestle in. It was awesome.  EXTREME CLOSEUP.  Okay, so those bitches started going at it and it was the worst thing ive ever seen. THey forgot to wear nothing under their clothes so we didnt get a good show! Kyle did run off to the bathroom for about 30 seconds though. Oh and by the way, as you might have noticed by previous posts, TONGUE RINGS ARE THE MOTHER FUCKING SHIZNIT.............YEAHHHHHHH!!! GIGGITY!!! Um..... okay, well now that we got that settled, we are gonna go get drunk since its kyles last night at the beach. Hopefully there wil lbe some nice chics at the deli tonight if we both go. Pop in a nice Backstreet Boys cd on the way and kcik back and listen to some nice musac. Okay, GODAMNIT KYLE! DIdnt we talk about this? Miss Spears needs a brake, her ass is getting too bruised. Go work on Kiera Knightley for a while, shes been a badddddd girl. HOOOOOOYAHHHHHHHH

      Fuckin kyle, you little bastard, what are you doin? Get ur ass home so we can get drunk my brotha! Ima start postin some crazy shit about ya on here if you fail. And yes my friend, we have learned that tongue rings are the mother fuckin bombdiggities. Godamn, edit this shit up b4 you get a smack down. I dont even know what the fuck im sayin anymore, im just kind of randomly hitting keys on the board here. Yep, alright, so this crazy lookin goat walked up to me one day and was like "Hey motha fucka! You got some weed?". Dude, i was like... "WHOA FOOL, dont be steppin up to me like you know me, cuz you dont know me motha fucka!" I mean this goat was one narly lookin fella. He had like a fuckin eyepatch and he had a peg leg motha fucka. So i just pulled back my left hand and just bitch slapped the shit outta that goat.  He dropped down and crawled his little goat ass away. And then his girlfriend walked up to me and got all up in my face "Why you hit my man like that, i pop ya foo!", so then i said "What the fuck do you want you goat fucker?!?", and shes lke "I said... what you doin motha fucka? I pull out my nine and pop a cap up in ya forhead bitch!"..... i can take a lot of shit man, but that goat fucker was pissin me off. So, then i was like "Step off! Bitch please, youd have to run and jump up to hit me in the knees! And once i pull out that glock, that glock dont stop. So you best turn ur goat fuckin self around and step the fuck off." Yeah man, she got all scared, she ran off after her little goat fuckin companion. Yeah, i told that biotch off.
