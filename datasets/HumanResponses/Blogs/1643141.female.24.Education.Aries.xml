       Very insightful. I'm Catholic, but have been studying Protestantism for years, and this helped a lot in understanding subtlies in Christianity. Plus, it's a great contrast to Aristotle.

       I really liked it. Not as funny as all the reviews say, but definitely witty. A tad insightful. Something you'd like to read if you are not feeling to good about your life and are loosing hope; this book can definitely help you regain it. Really a great read!

       It was definitely funny, though not hillariously funny. A bright note on a gloomy day.

       Got to page 16, and decided I had wasted $14.  What can I say about this book:  A TOTAL PIECE OF UNACADEMIC CRAP.  Supposed to be a linguistics book, it's written in a rather unorthodox way.  First, how many academians, or people interested in this book, would actually know anything about "Moe the Bartender" ( The Simpsons ) and his idiosyncratic use of speech.  Then, it's written for a typical American (a.k.a. monolingual) in complete disregard to the reverence and respect that should be given to other older languages, like those stemming from Latin.  Furthermore, it characterizes a misrepresentation of the spoken word in other languages with phonetic spellings that should be accurate, yet represent sounds that do not exist in English, therefore degrading the quality of a language that may have been spoken for thousands of centuries.   
 
I positively cannot understand why anyone would bother to write a book that makes him seem like an ignorant linguist-wanna-be, after working so long on achieving a Ph.D., and thus making the bestowing institution reconsider their original decision - but to no avail.  Mr. McWhorter should have been a comedian instead.  It was trully disappointing to find that a publishing company out there disgraced itself by publishing this book; on the other hand, I am glad it was not the publishing house of an academic institution.  Nevertheless, books like this one should never hit the shelves.

       Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels -- Not sure about it yet; let you know when I'm done.  

 Also reading The Complete Idiot's Guide to Knitting and Crocheting by ... well, a complete idiot who knows how to knit and crochet, I guess.   Actually, it's by Barbara Breiter and Gail Diven.  And It's been very helpful so far.

       The Rule of Saint Benedict by ... well, St. Benedict. Interesting take on the setting of rules in the Church in Medieval Europe. Still read 3 times a year by Benedictine Monks. Worth reading, if you like to get different perspectives on things, specially on Christian life.

       Definitely a useful resource when going blindfolded into the graduate applications process. Certainly does put things into a new perspective, and illuminates on a lot of dark corners.  Unfortunately, not enough people - who would like to go to grad school - get their hands on this little guide filled with insight into the unknow at a moment when they can certainly use it to their greatest advantage.  Nevertheless, reading it may result in the difference between being given a chance to become a Ph.D. and relegating and resigning yourself to living the life of a hopeful academic trapped in the webs of capitalism.

       Well, I don't tend to read history books which do not present the reader with original documents as evidence.  However, this book tells history in a way which compells the reader to keep going, while the hours pass as if they were minutes. Even though Herman does go back and forth from chapter to chapter, he manages to cover as much as possible the adventures and disaventures of Scots around the world, from the days before the Union until the present.  Definitely an enjoyable and worthwhile read.

       Definitely practical - though not greatly useful if you already   know   that you want to go to law school [if not necessarily be a lawyer].  However, it does provide you with a nice list of further readings.

       Great book! 

 Okay, I must admit that the guy does not provided me with enough substantiation, enough physical proof, full original documents.  On the other hand, I do understand that that can be anywhere from dangerous to illegal.  Nevertheless, not everthing is within the scope of believable without physical evidence.  Now, I must say that the only reason I did not put the book down and called it bull, is that Palast is a former UofCer; and I could tell from the moment I began reading, before I even knew he is one of us.  That having been said, I'll trust he has not forgotten that no claim is to be made unsubstantiate, and all claims must be justified.

      I am currently greatly stuffed. I haven't been eating, well... often. Actually I have forgotten to have dinner two days in a row. And I have been sleeping even less than that. Thank God for makeup!!!

Anyway, have just been going through the motions. I have gathered a volunteer for recommendation; and now I just have to update my CV, edit my BA paper into perfection, and ask one of my old professors for another. Not that I don't need to ask yet another three (yes, a Grand total of 4!) for law school recommendations. 

Right now I am really tired... . I am going to bed.


Topic of the day: We are all equal under the law, but we are not all equal. Big, controversial subject, yet one I find to be rather true.

Sideline Topic: Where have consideration, curtesy and manners gone?

      Well, I wanted to take the CPA Exam, as well as the Real Estate Agent Exam; but I don't meet the requirements right now. In Illinois, you have to have at least 150 credits to take the Exam, and an accounting concentration or equivalent. However, I went to an impractical institution, which I regret nor in the least bit; but would have handier if it hadn't been.

Anyway, I am applying for a M.S. in Accounting. It's been five, six years since I last had to fill out application forms, and look for FinAid. And this year, I get to do it twice! That's ridiculous.

On the other hand, I am feeling a lot better now that I have something to focus on, and look forward to. The QLC just got a bit better. However, as I remember my student loans, rent and bills, it all becomes a bit grim again. 

When will it end... .

       Yup, that's the name of my new blog, which I hope to figure out how to integrate to this one; or vice-versa.  

 You can find it at  urlLink http://qlcrisis.blogspot.com/ .  In any case, the latest crisis, of which I don't talk about there, is got everything to do with my wireless network in my new apartment.  I just keep coming and going like a bad tide.  And talking about Tide, they have really gotten themselves (and their customers, of course) a nice fragrance, as it smells like baby blankets (clean ones, that is). 

 Okay, no more rambling.

      No matter how down I may be at any given time, Google is always a great fix.  I don't know what I would do without those guys.  I mean, when something is not working at work, I google for a fix.  When I can't remember something that I had found before, I google for it or a reminder.  And now, they have email!  Uhm... gmail!  WooHoo!   urlLink    When will they stop impressing me, by making everything so much better.  Uhhh... I hope, never.&nbsp; urlLink

      I must admit I have put a lot of time into coming up with a design that I like for each blog I've had, but this time -- well, I just can't come up with something that I like. I just don't really care; so I am gonna have to go with one of the presets.

I really find it hard to make it through each day lately. Hadn't had this problem in so long, that I'd forgotten what it was like. I could even say that I am depressed, but I refuse to do that. Just as I refuse to admit to myself what it is that's depressing me. If I say it, then it's true; and if it's true then I have to do something about. There is just nothing I can really do about it right now; because however much I want it there are some other things that I could never forgive myself if I gave them up.

Enough generalizing for today, now.
