       Mood:  Unsure  Music:  Bush - Old  Dinner with Kim was really nice. I've been tossing some ideas around in my head for a while and it was quite theraputic to get rid of them. As for the meal, I had the most DELICIOUS taco salad in  the world.   Hope everyone had a great day of classes.

       Mood:  Sleepy  Music:  Wham - Wake me up before you go  I am not looking forward to tomorrow ... the school cycle begins again. Although I am looking forward to Thursday night at Farahs. Yippie!   Good luck Gary on your exam and GMAT studies ... you are going to do great! I am going to meet Kim for a bit o' Mexican for dinner. Adios!

       Mood:  Pleasantly bored  Music:  Portishead - Sour Times  I helped little bro #1 move into his dorm Wednesday. Here's a recap of that hellacious day.  Awake at 6 a.m. (after being asleep for 3 total hours) to shower and pack my car up.  7 a.m. we head to his campus arrive just in time to score a free breakfast in the dining hall and we are then quickly ushered to orientation. Hour upon endless hour they talk about the most useless crap. Fun. Then they decide that it is a fantastic time of day to take the campus tour. We are in  SOUTH FLORIDA  and it is 2 p.m., which as many of you know, is  PEAK HEAT . So here we are dragging our tortured minds across this damn campus, up stairs, around the same buildings until we all have nice blisters on our feet. Now it is 5 p.m. and the dorms open up to let students move in. Oh my day just got a  world  better. Now I have to carry over-packed boxes up 2 flights of stairs *with blisters on my feet* into a urine-scented hall.  So as I walk into the hall I make a small comment, quite softly to my brother "It smells like piss in here." So this bitch orientation leader, who is at most 19, comes over and says "Well, this is a college dormitory and in college this is what we live in." RIGHT. I reply "oh really, well when I lived in my dorm 3 years ago it didn't smell like piss and it was a condemned building."  Anyhow, now I am back in town and quite relieved to have some quiet time after this past week.

       Mood:  A bit too relaxed for having 2 exams  Music:  The Cars - Shake It Up  So I had 2 quizzes and 3 exams in 2 days. Not quite my idea of a jolly good time. But I got a 95 on my exam last night, I think I did well on this morning's exam and my final tonight will be a lot less stressful thanks to my 95 :)  I spoke with my mom today from India, she said her cab had to stop in the road to let a monkey cross. People milk cows in the middle of the street and pee right there in public. She went wild in the markets yesterday though, she said they have really nice things for really  really  cheap. She picked up some jewelry, a custom-made leather coat for my dad, purses, lamps, pashminas and cool beaded boxes. Whoo hoo, good deal Mom ;)  "I'm ready to get the hell home," said mom.  I'm gearing up to drink for free at Farah's tonight, so you better drag your lazy booty out and meet me!  Off to quiz #2 :) Have a delicious day!

       Mood:  Happy  Music:  System of A Down - Sugar  I had a great weekend with the fam. I missed Baila kitty a lot though :(  My mom had an 18 hour flight to India. I would go out of my mind. She said it is beautiful there, at least in New Dehli where she is staying.   I am going to make an honest attempt at productivity, so have yourself wonderful day.  GOOD LUCK GARY ON YOUR ACCOUNTING EXAM! YOU ARE ONE SMART COOKIE ;)

       Mood:  Smiley  Music:  STP - Wet My Bed  Kitty is napping on my lap. Why is she so adorable?  Poor thing though, today was her first vet visit. Let's just say that once she couldn't see me, all kitty hell broke loose. They'll think twice before taking her out of the room without me. Baila is quite healthy according to the vet (who then gave me a baggie of free goodies for Baila!)  Packing for the weekend is complete and I am about to get off this box and drift into a nice, calming sleep.   In case you are bored, check out some of these cool places ...

       Mood:  Tickled Pink  Music:  Counting Crows - 'Round Here   Ode to an Ass  Once upon a time there was this girl. She was weird, a carnie, seriously.  So carnie gal has a robust bootie, aka a  urlLink badonkadonk . Carnie girl has 2 friends, yes TWO WHOLE FRIENDS...one a virgin who is kinda like her bitch, and the other a self-employed prostitute whom she dislikes.  Anyhow, carnie gal thinks that she is cool, especially becasue she reads away messages and gets her panties in a wad about them.  Well, here's to you carnie girl. Kiss your vacuum friend goodbye and wave to her in Nashville.  All my love, Pathetic.   In other news, I went to Pet Supermarket today to purchase a kitty carrier. All they had was this BRIGHT blue one, called the Cosmic Carrier with cartooned space-bound animals riding in a shuttle...helmets and all. Oh the embarrassment tomorrow at the vet. Here comes Baila in her big blue shuttle.

       Mood:  Dandy  Music:  Outkast w/George Clinton - Synthisizer, wait! the song just changed: Fleetwood Mac - Go your own way  I took Baila kitty to Gary's to play. After she sniffed every square inch of his room she decided to play.   I ran into this guy Gregg that went to High School (and apparently elementary school) with me. He tells Gary that he has a video tape from the first grade where I was dancing in some recital. I dont even remember dancing in that, how in the hell does he? Kinda creepy.   On a side note, I love my cousins, they are amazing friends.

Weird man, but quite entertaining.  My friend Kim is coming over to visit Baila and I guess to see me as well :) But before she comes I need to run some errands.  Yup, it's that time again friends... peace out.   Suggestions for your clicking pleasure:  Pimp  urlLink kitty collars , I like the Zebra, gimmie some feedback, k?

I doubt I will have anything of interest to share on a daily basis, but I'll take a stab at it.    Daily activites : Played with Baila, Wal-mart with Garrison, viewed Garbage Pail Kids with Gary and Jenn (again, the 80's rocks my socks), then we hit the hot tub.   I am going to get some sleep now, so click another site and kill some time there because there aint anything else going on here.

       Mood:  Tired  Music:  INXS - I need you tonight  After quite a lovely day of shopping (Got my GAP fix for the month) I went to dinner with Jenn, Julie, Laura and Kelly. Now I was not drunk; I had one beer. Yet I managed to bust ass in the middle of the parking lot.  How? Oh, thanks to a lemon wedge. Yes, I slipped on a lemon wedge. As if falling on a lemon wedge on asphalt was not bad enough, I was in a skirt. Weeeeeee!  I also went to see Matrix reloaded with Gary. The movie was ok. Not deserving of all the hype, but entertaining nonetheless. If anyone saw the first 10 minutes of it and would like to fill me in, please do :)  On a side note, ebay is addictive. They have everything. I just won new eddie bauer capri pants :)   Have a lovely one, and please do be careful of those lemon wedges.

Now this establishment is SUPPOSED to be open until 2 am. Was it?   NO!!!   I had already set my mind on a tasty cone of chunky monkey. Damn them and their stupid hippie cows.   Ugh, I have a disturbing amount of work to do this week, starting with tomorrow... or actually today since it is 3 am. I have a quiz, an exam, 2 technology assignments and 2 html programming assignments. Oh yes, please factor in 3 more nights at the Alligator.  Somehow I need to create more time in a day. Let me know if you have figured that one out yet ;)

       Mood:  Calm  Music:  nothing. not a peep :)  I had a rather nice weekend. I went to dinner at Moe's with Kim ... you need to go to Moe's. Eat the Homewrecker - and make sure you go  very  hungry, as the portions are not made for the weak.   I am counting the days until my " urlLink golden birthday " (I was recently informed about such a thing.) Apparently, your golden birthday is when you turn the age of your date of birth, ie: I'll be 22 on July 22. Anyhow, I am feeling somewhat lukewarm about my birthday. It is on a Tuesday, not exactly a day of partying for most.   On a side note, Gary sent me this page, quite comical.  urlLink Sexual oragmi .   Reluctantly answered a phone call. Stupid   STUPID   me!

I have purchased some lovely spirits ( inspired by the many concoctions we drink at Farahs ) so let me know when you want to get together this weekend.   Here's what I would like to make:  Pineapple Upsideown shots (I sampled some last night ... mmm mmm good!)

       Mood:  Amused  Music:  George Michael - Never Gonna Dance  My little brother Danny gave Baila this toy, it's a sticky bug that is attached to a cord. Well, Baila broke the cord and now it is simply the bug. Anyhow, Baila figured out that in order to play with it, I need to throw it. So my smart kitty realized that I need have the bug in order to throw it.   My cat now plays fetch.  I throw the bug, she runs after it, plays with it and carries it back to me. She wont do it across the room but she will fetch within a few feet.   I have a cat that plays fetch. PIMP.

Little black ones that run around and I think they crawl up my leg, but that could be paranoia. I wasn't aware that bugs take up residence in cars. My car is black, perhaps the ants saw it as a huge black ant mecca.   I went to Aimee's house last night to watch a movie and we ended up at Heath and Franco's for a party. I had a few jello shots and chatted with a funny gay guy from high school. I am assuming he is gay b/c my gaydar was registering off the charts and then he mentioned going to UC later. He then said, oh I am not gay but then opened up when I said going to UC seemed like it would be fun and that I always wanted to see the drag show. He then talked about how he always goes there and gave me a little wink. I tihnk we were on the same page there. So we exchanged numbers and I now have a funny little gay buddy. Jenn will love him! Oh he can watch queer eye with us. Fun.  It's time for me to get ready of the game. GO GATORS

       Mood:  relaxed  Music:  Tears for frears - Shout   Things were quite calm today despite being up super early and the ungodly temperature outside.  I met with my prof and figured out the details of my independent study. I am going to be her teaching assistant for her copy and vis labs and also work on a radio and tv campaign to be entered into the Addy's. (Addy's are a national advertising competition) UF sweeps it every year and she thinks my Chicago and Jergens campaigns have a good shot at taking 1st. I'd love that! Hmm, I would need an acceptance speech for my Addy... haha.   My friend Vanessa is moving back to Atlanta for her job and she has been wanting to transfer back for a while. I am quite happy that things worked out for the best. Congrats Vane!   So here's my gripe of the day:  Getting up for my 3rd period class only to find out upon arrival that it has been cancelled. Fun times.   My cousin is visiting from NY and wants to come to the Vandy game on homecoming weekend. She is willing to pay well for the tickets so please let me know asap if you know someone who wants to sell. On the topic of football, check this out and tell me how cute little brother #1 is :)   urlLink My brother the baller

       Mood:  Tired  Music:  None  Jenn and I got a pizza for dinner and there was 1/2 a pie left that we wanted to save for lunch tomorrow. We left the box in the lounge at the Alligator and several hours later, Jenn notices that our pizza is gone. How do you eat 1/2 a pizza without thinking "Hey, this doesnt belong to me." Ugh, rude people.   Speaking of rude people ... or not speaking to them for that matter, I think that I've gotten over being upset and I dont really care one way or the other anymore. (Some of you may know what I am referring to, some may not. If not, dont worry, it's someone not worth explaining)  I am very excited about my professional attire. I had a mini fashion show in my room after work. I think I might enjoy getting all gussied up for work. I need shoes to go with it now. I might check out TJ Maxx, they always have designer shoes for cheap.   I can't believe classes start tomorrow! The semester is going to suck. Screw the UAA for making me take 12 credits when I only need to take 8. It would be nice to drop the 2 bullsh*t classes and have some time to relax. Off to bed, I have classes tomorrow. I'm just soooo excited :)

I went a tad crazy. Everything was on sale so I had to, you know how that goes :) If you dont, you probably are not female.   Poor Gary, he has a pot head roommate who seems to be high off his ass 24/7.   My copy and vis prof wants me to do an independent study with her and help teach her class as well. She mentioned something else about filming commercials but I am awaiting the details. I hope I get approved by asshole Dr. Sutherland b/c I think this will be a great opportunity. She has connections all over and she has worked at every major agency from coast to coast. I can learn a lot from her. Fingers are crossed!  Off to work :)

       Mood:  blah  Music:  zeta  Things in life work in a funny way. I find out my mom is getting better and everything will be ok with her and then my dad has an ulcer and needs to get some test on his colon. That's where he is now, at the hospital for 2 hours. I think it is a lot more serious than my parents are saying, or NOT saying.  They both look at one another when I ask why he is going and they both say "just some test, don't worry" and they get all weird. They also hesitate to say something, and they both avoid talking about it. My mom didn't answer me when I asked her 3 times in a row. People don't just get a 2 hour colon exam for fun, so I have a hard time believing that it is just "some test." My dad's father has colon cancer. That's why I am worried. My parent's behavior isn't helping.  Hopefully this will all work out for the best.

       Mood:  Content  Music:  Phone ringing   Finally! The repair men left, after several annoying hours of banging and speaking what sounded like french mixed with italian. Mom says they were polish.  I have a few events lined up this week, all of which seem like they will be fun (which is quite nice seeing how ever other time I am here I usually sit in the house, or freeze my ass off trying to brave Michigan Ave and Navy Pier.)  Tomorrow I am going to the mall with my brother to get him new shoes and find a suit. Eeeek, the real world is closing in! Wednesday I have a hair appointment and then my dad and I are going to Milwaukee to go beer tasting then we are off to a Brewers game. Milwaukee is about 30-40 mins away from our house.  Thursday we are going to see the musical Mamma Mia downtown with my family, my mom's boss, his wife and daughter. Aurora (she is 23) and I are then going to go for drinks at some fun latin bar. She says they make the best Sangria in Illinois.  I met Aurora Sunday and she is super nice. Yay, my first Chicago buddy. We went to the mall with my mom and oh does she loves to shop. She tells me that she loves MAC, Sephora and the GAP. Needless to say, we were like 2 kids in a candy store. A multilevel candy store :) Friday is dad's birthday and my flight back to Ft. Lauderdale.   I miss Garrison and the kitty :(

Now we need to have our floors sanded and re-finished to prevent molding. My mom is one pissed off lady about all this.   My mom was watching the food netowrk last night and they were making tropical cocktails. Well they made the mojito and my mom, who never ever drinks, made me go to the store and buy the ingredients. We had the MOST DELICIOUS mojitos I have ever tasted. Zack needs to revamp his mojito recipe b/c it sucks compared to what I whipped up last night.   Toodles!

It was a nice time, and Jenny shared a hilarious story about a murder case involving a midget with dreads who shot a transvestite prostitute. Apparently, after the trial the midget family attempted to attack the jury by running over and hurling their little bodies over the railing. Sorry, I cant help laughing. Try to imagine the scene before you call me cruel.   I printed my application for graduation, whoo hoo! My lil bro's birthday is Wednesday, which coincidentally is International Left Handed Day.

       Mood:  Ahhhhhh  Music:  Tom Petty - American Girl  I'm sure most of you know this, but for non-UF students, that song (American Girl) is about some chick at UF who jumped off the 13th floor of Beaty Towers. Random FYI.  Anyhow, I'm doing laundry. Lots of it. I need to pack for Chicago and Coral Springs. If anyone can give me a ride to the airport it would be much appreciated :) My mom wont let precious little Michael drive alllll the way down from Boca to take me. Boca, mind you, is about a 15 minute drive to Coral Springs ... and not to mention the fact that I drove 5 hours from Gainesville 2 weekend in a row to help him fill out paperwork for college and then another weekend I moved him into his dorm. (A full recap of that hellacious experience is in an earlier post.) Sorry, I am just bitter. My mom treats my brother like he is helpless sometimes. Everyone can help him out, but he cant return the favor. Sorry again. Still bitter.   I took too long of a nap yesterday afternoon and missed dinner with Seth, Shawn and Kim. Damn meds! Gary took me to Chopsticks later when I was showered and coherent. The pad thai there is fan-freakin-tastic.

       Mood:  Dazed and Confused  Music:  The monsoon outside  This medicine is putting me in a weird trance-like state. I find myself starting aimlessly spacing out. After my exam yesterday, I slept from 3:45 till 9. I would have slept longer, but my phone kept ringing. I usually have a hard time taking naps, unless I am sick. Gary came over with pizza shortly after I woke up. I know he really wanted to go out but I felt like I had been beaten up. So he graciously accepted the fact that I was going to be a bum while everyone else partied the end of the semester off.  Debi stopped over to bring me a little treat. She brought homemade zucchini bread, wrapped up Martha Stewart-style with a pretty yellow ribbon. I dont like Martha much, but I have to admit that the woman's got style. Debi also made a loaf for Gary.  Thanks Debi! I then fell asleep a bit before 1 am and didnt wake up until noon. One would think with all that sleep I would be bright eyed and bushy tailed. Nope, I'm about to get into my bed and sleep until dinner with Seth and Shawna.  I am going to try and muster the strength to go out tonight with Gary and his pal Nick. I will take my meds early so I dont get all weird when I go out.  I'm going to take my nap, have a lovely afternoon!

       Mood:  Cranky   Music:  Green Day - Waiting   One final down. I have the option of passing out into a deep, narcoleptic-like coma until my next exam or I could study. Decisions, decisions.  After my exam at 2, I plan on picking up my ear and sinus medication (which happens to cause drowsiness - whoo hooo!) and sleep for a good few hours.  I had a sneezing fit during my exam today which I guess wasn't such a bad thing b/c it kept me from nodding off.   I might write Kate an email b/c I seriously dont want to call her - but if I dont talk to her soon she will start asking why I dont call her back and I dont want to start some shit just yet.  I am avoiding this confrontation because I am so angry with her right now and anything I say to her is going to come out wrong and probably a lot more hurtful than I want. I also know that right now if we get into why I cant stand her, I will tell her that I dont want to make amends.  I dont know how this can be resolved and I know that talking to her would help, but I'm not there yet. I just need some time to simmer and calm down so that I dont say anything irrational. I also dont really want to resolve things with her right now and I might find out that I dont want to, ever. I think that's why I need some time. If I talk to her now, it will get really ugly.

       Mood:  somewhere between tired and stressed  Music:  Les Miserables - At the end of the day  I got wind of several wonderful productions that will be making their way to Gainesville this fall. Mainly Miss Saigon and Rent. I am not sure how accurate my source is, but I'm excited regardless. I have been pining to see these plays! I hope that they don't sell out as fast as Les Mis (my absolute favorite Broadway play) because I missed it while it was here and now the bloddy thing of off Broadway.   Back to my studies, I have a test in 2 hours! Eeek!

       Mood:  Happy  Music:  Something indecipherable from the next apartment... but there is a lot of bass.  OK, I know I have posted quite a few loooong things today, but this is actually funny. This is a disturbing excerpt from my friend's  ex-boyfriend/sorta still seeing/whatever you want to call him  livejournal. I found it a bit weird to post something in this MUCH detail. Hope you aren't too creeped out...   "Anyways going on…I woke up this morning around 11:00 and I touched myself, it was pleasant, not something that should be done everyday, but today was special because I skipped class and it was exciting. My roommate thought it would be fun to constantly IM me while I was doing it, so I used my intuition and figured that he was going to keep IMing me (because he thought it was funny) and I minimized the IM screen so I wouldn’t have to be interrupted, thank you Bill Gates"   Eww. Please DO NOT post your personal pleasures, I BEG OF YOU!

       Mood:  Nervous  Music:  I am studying there is no music playing allowed (Duran Duran - Come Undone... I'm a slacker, what can I say!)  I procrastinate entirely too much. The information isn't going to just appear in my brain. Yet every exam I piddle around until I start to freak out. I'm like one of those stupid gerbils at some lab where they get zapped for doing things, yet keeps on doing them.  I am afraid I am going to get to my final, sit down and stare aimlessly at my paper and think "way to go slacker, now start guessing." OK so I am not THAT bad, I can actually manage to retain a fair amount of material last minute, and I have been working  really  hard this summer with my classes, but it still bothers me. I should really put a little more time into studying. I'm saying all this while playing on the internet. I'm in one of those self-critical moods. Probably because I'm trying to avoid studying. I'll probably scrub my bathroom soon. That's another procrastination ritual. With all that said, I actually made some progress in my studies, I'm quite proud of myself (self-critical mood is over). I got 100% on my lab final today... studied last night at work for a bit and Sunday afternoon.  I made my own review sheet for my thing tomorrow and I think I am going to go over it shortly. I also organized my notes for one of my finals on Thursday. I will study those when I finish reviewing my review sheet.   I don't know how Gary does it, he spends hours in the library every day for a week for his accounting classes (math, gag!). He's a smart cookie. I suppose if I was taking accounting (or any advertising class) and not Computers in Modern Society, my ass would be in the library too.    Off to study, I swear :)

      Mood: very very very tired Music: Alannah Myles - Black Velvet   Let me set the mood:   I'm tired. I did not get any sleep because the cat (cute as she may be) took some crack rock and ran around like a psycho all night long.   So here's the scenario:  I am on my way to class with bags under my bloodshot eyes to take a lab final when this man on a bicycle (let's call him 'I'm-a-piece-of-hippie-crap-on-my-bike') rides next to my car. I'm-a-piece-of-hippie-crap-on-my-bike then looks at me, flicks me off, and then smiles. I did nothing to this man yet he feels the need to flip the bird and then smile. Oxymoron if you ask me... "fuck you but have a great day!" If I wasn't running late to my exam I would have invested the time to chase I'm-a-piece-of-hippie-crap-on-my-bike down with my car and scare the crap out of him... with a smile on my face.  On another, even more random note, I'm going to share a fantastic link with you because you actually read my pointless assortment of thoughts.  go to ... drum roll please ... www.949zeta.com From there, find where it says "listen now" or something to that effect. I'm sure you can figure the rest out -- you college-learned individual, you.  Viola! You now should have the greatest rock station streaming live into your little ears. Ahhhh, Zeta is a beautiful thing.   I swear, I just regurgitate whatever makes its way into my head. Oh, I am annoyed with my "best friend" Kate (who obviously knows nothing about my blog or else I would not write the scathing things that I am about to).  Anywhom, Kate has become as deep as a Tupperware lid. The only conversation I have been able to have with her lately have been about one of three things: 1) Herself 2) Her not-so-new fake boobs 3) Her stressful part time job as a file clerk. (It is stressful b/c they dont say thank you when she goes home. Call me crazy, but isn't that what the paycheck is for??) I suppose 2 and 3 fall under 1.  So I have been avoiding Kate like the plague. I dont know what to do. How do I go about telling her that I think she is a shallow and narcissistic? Ideas would be greatly appreciated.  I am going to take a nap, so for the greater good of our friendship,  do not call me . I am grumpy as hell when I wake up.   Just  urlLink click  it. You know you wanna :) Vanessa sent  urlLink this  to me ... it induced quite a chuckle.

       Mood:  OK  Music:  311 - Down  I went to visit my cousins in Tampa (Spring Hill if you desire the technical version) and had a lovely time. First off, italian home cookin' is always a great thing, and it was sure nice to get out of Gainesville. My uncle was able to get rid of the tree sap on my car hood. It had been there for at least 4 months and I have not been able to get it off. I tried EVERYTHING. Everything except what he used, which took all of 3 minutes to apply and remove. Whooo hooo! I was very excited about that, I called my dad and Gary to brag about my uncle's car waxin' skills.  I got home last night and began to study for the onslaught of tests and quizzes I have this week. I also have some sort of ear infection and I am coming down with a cold. This is a great combination with final exams :)  I wish you all good luck on your finals this week and hope to see you Thursday night at Farah's to celebrate the end of the semester.

       Mood:  Over it  Music:  Nirvana - Heart-shaped Box  I have come to the realization that sometimes it is harder to be mad than to just not give a damn. So, I don't give a damn. I am over the superficial drama and the pathetic nature of certain people.  After a while you would think they would take a step back and say, "Hey, wait a minute, maybe I'm the asshole." Hahaha, what am I thinking? That will never happen, at least not with the self-indulged individuals that I know.

       Mood:  Spent  Music:  Trading Spaces on TV  I'm a dork; I bought Baila the leash. Even worse, I walked her. She doesn't walk like a dog does, but she goes a few feet, plops on the ground and looks around. She tried to roll in the dirt several times, but no kitty of mine is gonna roll in dirt and come back to sleep in my bed.   Mom is mad at me. Very very mad. She got the credit card bill. It was admittedly a lot, BUT (my parents hate when I say 'BUT') she approved over 3/4 of the charges. And those were the most expensive things. Oh well, I cant win.  After getting yelled at for the majority of the afternoon, I searched for jobs in FLORIDA, which is far far farrrrrrrr away from Illinois. If she yells at me like this while I don't live at home anymore, there is no way I am going to go back (unless I cant get a job, and then I will be the most miserable person in America, officially).  I found some fun websites, so check them out: For the non-alcoholic  urlLink lush  in you  urlLink Q-tips  gone wild

       Mood:  Cheery  Music:  STP - Piece of Pie  Thursday night at Farahs has been cancelled.  Much thanks to the drunken kelpto who spolied our months of free fun.   I am actually considering buying Baila a leash. She keeps trying to get out, so I figure if I walk her (walk a cat, I know how strange that seems) it might decrease the allure of the outdoors.  It's worth a try :)

       Mood:  Very happy  Music:  Les Mis - Castle on a Cloud  I had a weird moment today. I work up around 9 a.m. and had a vague memory of a dream in which I received a call about my resume and setting up an interview.  After class I checked my voice mail and find that there is one saved message. Weird, I didn't remember saving a message. Turns out that I had indeed been called about my resume and this company wanted to set up an interview.  Apparently in my comatose, I heard my phone ring, checked my voice mail and saved the message. And I then wrote it all off as a dream. Thankfully it was saved, otherwise I would not have a lovely little interview set up :)  Anywho, I am meeting Jenn for lunch in about an hour at the racquet club. They have this yummy eatery, Cranberry Farms, there... out of this world cobbler!!  So I am officially addicted to ebay. I have been on a bidding spree. I have won dolce & gabbana sunglasses, burberry sunglasses (both said they were authentic) and MAC perfume. Ebay rocks my socks.

       Mood:  Wonderful  Music:  Kiss 105.3 in the computer lab at Spyglass  Yesterday started off as a bad day. Woke up late. Found out Bell South disconnected my telephone (apparently my online payments did not register in their account management department and they shut if off despite the fact that every payment had cleared through my bank) Drove to the Ocala mall iwth Stephanie to get the shoes I need for career fair in my size to find that Burdines was closed for inventory purposes.   Things got much better. We ate lunch, Burdines opened, I got my shoes (cute!) and when I got home, I found out that I was offered interviews by 3 companies.  Hot damn, I was super excited.  Monster.com is where it is at.

       Mood:  Content  Music:  Orgy - 107  My intention was to drink away the memory of the Gator-Miami game last night. I ended up drinking away my rational thinking.  It started off innocently enough at Sarah and Nicole's; I was helping Sarah make miniature pigs in a blanket.  From there it digressed into taking jolly rancher shots and drinking a tremendous amount of beer. Jell-O shots surfaced and Heather did this finger-licking motion that sent me into hysterics for a good while.  Somewhere during the night, a football game took place where my team lost and I drank a lot more.  A cop arrived, all the ladies thought he was a stripper, and we were awaiting his performance. Turns out his was on patrol and a friend of Nicole's and just wanted to say hello. Oops.  I had my first social experience with Warren (whom I have heard much about via Jenn) as well as his drunken alter-ego Tony. Someone named Anthony surfaced later, but we aren't at that point yet.  Anywho, the Warren/Tony duo proceeded to tell us that chubby fingers are indicative of a large chubby. He then wiggles his fingers at us. My friends have dubbed him chubbs. Oh lordy!   We eventually end up at Gary's place where his roommates are having a party. Somehow, about 7 or 8 of us were in Gary's room and ended up stripping down to our underoos (some of us went a bit further) in front of each other. We then put on every clean article of clothing that Gary owned and hit the hot tub. I think this is where Anthony made his grand entrance. Tony grabbed my boob earlier in the night accidentally and Anthony went for the gold. He was swimming through people legs under water and proceeded to go through mine when he had an abrupt surfacing. Abruptly into my crotch.  I don't remember the course of action that led to the indoor slip-n-slide, but Gary and roommate David wet and sudded the tarp on the floor and were sliding across their living room.   Thankfully I arrived home safely, didn't get sick and was coherent enough to remember the incriminating events of the evening.

       Mood:  Relieved  Music:  Bush - Break on through cover  I commend Matt Marriott for shooting at a tow truck. It wasn't the most logical thing to do, but I certainly don't blame him. I was towed today ... from a visitor spot. VISITOR DAMMIT! I was towed once before and I was parked in a visitor spot. Apparently, the tow truck drivers are illiterate and do not understand that the "V" on the parking space stands for visitor.  Stupid ACR tow truck men.  I went down to Gary's office to complain about my car being towed illegitimately and the property manager went all psycho bitch on me. Not a good idea, lady. I'm a bitch who's car was towed.  Needless to say, I got my car delivered back to University Commons, free of charge.  Hopefully, Elite towing will explain to their Neanderthal drivers that "V" is visitor and that you don't tow those parked there.  Fools!

We find out our client tomorrow and hopefully it is something really good, unlike last semester where they had to do peaceful paths - an online religous mail-order gift basket company.  I want the new MAC unisex cologne. I like the white one, which they were sold out of. I might just oder it online. Shipping isn't that much. Hmm.   My meeting with Dr. Correll went well today. We decided that the i-pod might be a better product, but she wants me to come up with some creatives before we decide for sure. I also have to create attendance sheets for the lab sessions. It's fun playing teacher. I have already received emails from the students about their presentations next week. Too cute!  Ugh, off to class again ... yay for Navigating the Internet.

       Mood:  Rested  Music:  Kitty playing with a platic bag  Decisions!!! So there is a costume party this evening (not the work-related one). I have 2 costume options: 1) A witch costume I bought from Wal-Mart. It looks like Stevie Nicks meets trailer trash ...or... 2) An italian mafia member, pinstriped pants, hat, wife beater, gold pinky ring and suspenders.  Please help me decide. I'm leaning towards the ganster for comfort factor.   I've decided to get crackin' on holiday shopping. I compiled lists of what I need to get and I have actually purchased a few of these things. I'm trying to avoid spending all of my money at once and being broke during the holidays. Plus, I dont want to worry about Christmas (and Hannukah) shopping during finals.   I am going to return my witch costume now, I made my decison. Crushed velvet witch dress = not figure flattering.

      What a day! I wake up this morning and my left eye is swollen, puffy, bloodshot and oozing. Gross, I know. Anyhow, I hop on over to the infirmary and they do all these weird tests on me. They put this solution on my eye that burned like all hell and it then made my eye numb. They then added this dye to my cornea and turned off all the lights. Out comes a portable black light and the lady makes me look directly into it for the next 3 minutes while she prods at my eyeball.  Apparently I have an infected cornea, which can only be treated with a certain type of eye drop which so happens to be $68 per bottle. After my exam, she tells me not to touch my eye for 3 hours until the numbness wears off otherwise I could damage my eye. Fantastic! Once I get home I notice that my whole eye area is stained from the dye. I it the color of Cheetos. It also wont come off. If you see me at work later and it looks like I rubbed cheetos on my eye, it is the dye.

      There are some people at the Alligator who have forged some sort of middle-school-esque clique. The actual idea of this is completely hilarious, not only because it is juvenile to make an elusive group (I know, sororities, blah blah, but I quit, I saw the light), but also because WHO the people in the new "elite" circle are.  Anywho, these people are no longer welcome at my apartment for fun little diddy's. :)

It was snowing and what to my wondering eyes did appear? GIRLS IN FLIP FLOPS. These girls were in coats, gloves -- decked out in full winter gear but were wearing flip flops from Old Navy. Craziness!!!  It snowed more that I have ever seen today and it was pretty. It was only pretty until I had to get out of the car and walk through it. The most difficult part of snow, aside from the wicked coldness, is that it blows into your eyes as you walk.   Enough of my complaining; it is really pretty to see snow fall and to spend the holiday bundled up by the fire watching snow fall. There is something very right about that, like this is the way it is supposed to be at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

On the brighter side, I got a job! I start tomorrow working as the Marketing Director!! :) I am sooooo excited but I am quite nervous right now. I just dont know what tomorrow will be like and I am a little apprehensive -- first day jitters I suppose.   I had a lovely weekend with Gary, we went down to Ft. Lauderdale beach and stayed the weekend. It was nice to hang out and get away from living with our parents/grandparents.   I have come to the conclusion that I do not like serious television. The news, for example, has been bothering me lately. All the political debate and blah blah blah serious blah blah crap. So, charmed will be my television preference. Silly, not serious and quite entertaining. Mock me if you'd like, but I love it!  Anywhom, that's that. I am going to try and get some sleep, I have  BIG day tomorrow!!!!!! Whooo hooo! :)

In two weeks I am gonig to NY for my cousin's engagement party. She's gonna be a bride!!!! How exciting!!!!!!!!!  On a sad note, I'm bored as heck here. Gary and I hardly spend time together b/c it's tax season. He has been working 12-13 hour days and weekends, so it sucks. Come April 15 he's all mine... you hear that taxes, I'm taking him back!  :) hehe.

Holy f-ing crap! I have the opportunity to meet Madonna.  Nancy and I are trying to get a hold of our boss to get off work.  OMG, I used to dance to Borderline when I was 3! Madonna, no way! I would be speechless.  I don't know what I would do if I shook her hand - dear heavens... I might take a picture with her.  AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

      Went to see the potential apartment rental during my lunch hour.  Greasy guy in a caddy takes me to a "studio that I just have to see."  Me: "I'm not interested in a studio"  Greasy: "It's worth seeing, it's a great deal."  Me: "I still don't want a studio."  Greasy: "Here we are!"   Walk up to decent looking building.  Open door.  Inhale urine fumes.  Shoot Greasy evil look.  Look left. Look right.  That's the whole place. About 150 square ft.   Off to the 1 bedroom in the nice neighborhood.  Walk up to decent building.  Walk to the unit's door.  See dog poop on the walk way.  Go inside.  Greasy: "We just installed this new carpet."  (New carpet? Yes, it was new, but it was industrial carpet, you know the scratchy hard stuff you find in workplaces and middle schools. And it was brown with yellow "Accents")  Greasy: "And this unit is spotless"  (Spotless? If I'm not mistaken, isn't that the previous tenant's urine in the toilet bowl?)  The bedroom could fit a twin sized bed in it and that's about it.  Kitchen was teeny tiny and it was NASTY.   I look at him and say, sorry... not interested.   Here's the kicker...  Greasy: "I have this great TRAILER PARK you can rent"   TRAILER PARK? A fucking trailer park??!!! (excuse the french, but really!)  I looked at him and told him to piss off.

      A few months ago, I wanted to buy a condo. Then reality struck me, Buy?!? Crap, that's so adult, so permanent and I'm only 23.  But rates are low, blah blah, and I "should" buy.  Well there is damn diddly squat out there in my price range and I don't have the patience or cash flow to do major updating like a lot of the condos need. I cant buy a place with pea green appliances and a yellow toilet.  What they&nbsp;heck&nbsp;were people thinking??&nbsp; I can handle painting, new carpet, new blinds. But I draw the line at the lemonade bathroom.  So, I'm now considering renting... against Gary's advising (and he's always right, so I'm not quite sure what the heck is wrong with me).  I found this place in downtown Ft. Lauderdale in an area called Croissant Park. 10 mins from work, 15 mins from Las Olas and a hop skip and jump to 95. New carpet, new paint- It sounds great. I will hopefully check it out tomorrow and, god willing, it will look great too.  Wish me luck!   &nbsp;

      FREE!  Holla, it's tax free week and I'm sure lovin' that.  I hit up target and they had some great sales going on...plus it's tax FREE!  I'm so easily amused.   I'm going to see Catwoman later with Kel and then hit up the Crepery for dessert. I got invited to this free food tasting thing (my aunt works for the city and scored me a ticket)... (again, I love FREE) and the Crepery was there giving out crepes... they were orgasmic! Mine had strawberries, bananas, dulce de leche cream sauce and caramel. MMM, I'm salivating. Ever since then, I've been a fan the that place. How the heck can you not be a fan of tasty, fattening French dessert?   And why is fattening food so damn good? I had coke c2 today, soooo nasty. Don't bother. It tastes like diet coke (with a weird aftertaste) plus it has more calories than diet coke. Food is definitely my vice. And Pauly Shore is my guilty pleasure!   Ta ta my dears, it's tax free week and I better get steppin!   &nbsp;

      I never understood why people loved their TiVo. Whoo, it's an advanced vcr.  How terribly wrong I was.  I put Charmed on a season pass and it tapes them all!  Man, I love this thing!   I need a tan again.  Last time my milk white body was graced by sunlight, I was charred. I literally couldn't walk, I had to go braless for a week, which was really fun at work, let me tell you.  I managed to keep that tan for about 3 weeks, but now I'm back to my usual, blindingly white pallor.   &nbsp;

       urlLink     Us&nbsp;ladies&nbsp;on Atlanta's Orient Express  &nbsp;    Hotlanta   was excellent!&nbsp;I love that city... I&nbsp;think I want to move there.&nbsp;  Thursday we went to this bar where we met&nbsp;a man from Philly.&nbsp;He told us that he was from Philly about 2 dozen times that night - just in case we missed it the first time. He was piss drunk and kept calling us "Georgia Peaches."&nbsp;They started playing Blister in the Sun, and apparently Mr. Philly&nbsp;thought it was amazing that I knew the words. Mind you, none of the conversation with Mr. Philly was solicited... I don't even think we acknowledged him, yet he kept coming up to our booth and jumping like he had a tamale up his keister! Oh, and he called me Sweet Cheeks a handful of times. Goo. We then bolted out the side door when he was doing a celebratory lap around the bar (FYI - he was celebrating some song that the band played - he was a FREAK!)  &nbsp;  Friday was a strange course of events. Vanessa had to work so Kelly and I were essentially prisoners to her apartment -- locked up with Sparky, her dog. Sparky is on crack rock. He does not sleep, does not stop moving and has a disturbingly illicit&nbsp;love affair with the bunny (I'll get into that later.)  Kelly and I are in her apartment for a few hours and get hungry so we look for cereal... all stale. Open the freezer ... empty less some ice cream for dogs. We found some bread but the only thing we found to put on said bread was a brick of cheese that was easily 4 months old - black with mold. Vanessa has no local number so we cant call for pizza, we have no car and we have no idea where we are. Needless to say, we were mighty excited when we found a box of Kraft Mac-n-cheese buried under the 500 pounds of dog food in her pantry. We make the&nbsp;Mac and as we are eating it, we both start to look at each other. Something is seriously wrong with the&nbsp;Mac-n-cheese. We eat a little more and both decide it's awful. &nbsp;Kelly pulls the box out from the garage and finds out that it expired LAST YEAR!  So nasty.  Fast forward 2 hours... Kelly and I are confined to the bathroom for pretty much the daylight hours.  Finally, our tummies settle and what to our wondering eyes do appear? Sparky humping the sweet life out of his toy bunny. He then moved to Kelly's arm. I was able to snap a picture of that -&nbsp;hehe!  We then saw Fuel in concert at&nbsp;Centennial Park - that was pretty nifty!  Off to bar hopping, Disco Diner (drag queen servers with disco music playing 24/7 -FAN FREAKIN TASTIC!!)  Saturday was shopping in Buckhead then pizza and trivia at NYPE.  Sunday we walked around downtown, had some mojitos at Hard Rock and went to CNN.  And that was my weekend stint in Atlanta.  :)  &nbsp;

      Maybe I'm totally naive or innocent (hmm, doubt that one)... but I just do not understand men.   I'm walking back from the copier (gee, sounds like  urlLink Office Space ) when I pass this agent. His is apparently bi-polar and is one of those "a little too friendly for comfort" types. I smile and say hello, he says "What are you up to?" and before I can even respond,  WHAM!  He smacks my ass.   Yup, right in the middle of the office, for no apparent reason and COMPLETELY unwarranted. If you know me, you know I'm not particularly shy or quiet about things that bother me, but I was stunned. I just stood there with my mouth open for a good 30 seconds.   Strange how you react to things like that. I mean, had he been 30 years younger, not partially bald with a bad comb-over and significantly less vile, I wouldn't have been so disturbed... but he's 100% creepy. Ugh, I felt like I needed a shower.   On another note, I'm starting to freak out about my flight to Atlanta Thursday. I can't seem to rationalize my fear. Every time I fly, I get off the plan and say, see Alissa, that wasn't so bad. But every time I have to fly again, I have these horrid thoughts. It doesn't help that I take 595 to work and pass right by the airport. Oh, and this guy at work (the same one who tells me I need a tan) told me that summer is the worst time to fly because of bad storms and turbulence. When someone tells you they are TERRIFIED of flying, don't make it worse!   I thought about getting completely tanked in the airport bar, but I'm not sure it if will calm me or heighten my fear... I can just imagine getting on the plane and wigging out in a drunken frenzy. Maybe I can find a heavy sedative and knock myself out before the flight. Ugh, why am I such a pansy??!!

       Mood:  Blah  Music:  Some really bad sitcom in the other room  I am freelancing for a band... little brother of New Found Glory. They are really pretty good, and if their own talent and merit doesn't get them anywhere, they can at least ride on the coattails of his brother for a while.  Anywho, they need a logo and I'm doing it. Frustrating part is that they are not telling me what they want and not giving me any direction. I know nothing about the band so I cant even go from that. I came up with about 17 different logos and they like them all. They cant pick and now one of their mother's is helping them pick and she picked easily my least favorite of the 17. I wasn't even going to show them it but emailed it by accident.  Oh well, that will teach me to email fugly logos again :)  Whoo hoo, Atlanta in 3 days!!!

       Wake me up befre you go, go      Mood:   Swirly   Music:   None  Im trying to wake myself up! Monday's are the worst for getting up and I can't seem to figure out why. I think I might be getting sick... My nose is on-again-off-again stuff and I've been sneezing up a storm. That's probably why I'm so sleepy today. I hope I'm not getting sick because I'm leaving for HOTLANTA Thursday!!!! Whoo hooo (Can you tell that I am excited?)  I'd better get my butt in the shower if I plan to get to work on time.  Chow!

        Mood:   Tired  Music:  The Cars- Let the good times Roll  My friend's birthday is coming up and she lives in Colorado. I need to get her a gift but the problem comes with mailing it. See, Jenn and my cousin's birthday were back in May and their presents are still in my car waiting to be mailed. May!!! So I was thinking of just ordering something online for my Colorado buddy and having it shipped directly to her... do you know of any good sites to do that? (I alrealy tried Sephora.com but bought perfume for myself - so that didnt go over too well)

        Music:   Peal Jam - Black   Mood:   Sleepy  Yes, it's been a while.  Things are going well in SOFLO, but I seriously miss Gainesville. I miss the places, people and lack of responsibility. But I think realistically about going back and I realize that Gville is just a very fond memory.   Funny quote o'the day: My brother Mike to Baila the cat... "I should take you out with me tonight... the ladies would love you!"  I recently discovered Kilwins chocolate factory in Springs... ice cream made on the premises served in a WARM waffle cone. Wow! Although the warm cone and ice cream wasnt exactly as good of a combo in retrospect... my ice cream leaked all over the table and Gary had to get a wad of napkins and then some water for me to wipe my hands off with.   I'm thinking about getting a LJ, LJ users get those really cool mood icons... I think I would like the cool mood icons.  Oh, I am not sure I entirely understand the whole Friendster thing... care to fill me in, friend?  Toodles for the time being.
