        of homemade ecards, so to speak. :D its not TECHNICALLY homemade, since its done on a computer.. but its still great.  yun  sent me this card he made himself..     urlLink http://www.geocities.com/shen2939/index.html       but its all in chinese! and the only link that i click closes the window. :( im confused. but its sweet anyway. and  steven  sent me an ecard from taiwan!! so that was really amazing. im just really kind of pleasantly surprised that even people who dont see me on a regular basis remembered. :D that makes me feel so special..  this was SUCH a rad party.. and it was just so much better because each person who attended has a  very  special place in my heart. aww.. so sappy. a huge thanks to  michelle , by far the furthest traveller.. she came from  missisauga !! thats as far as india, as far as im concerned. AND she came like 2 hours early to help me set up!! lol she totally solved my streamers problem [see blog below] and we even figured out how to get the balloons to go in between the garlands of paper.. :D attach ribbon to the neck of the balloon, and tape up the ribbon. ooh.. i know.  Ã¼bersmart .  my brother and dad helped to fill up water balloons.. and  gwen  was the next to arrive. then  sylvia . then we were watching  drumline , and  quoc ,  danna , and  tina  popped in together.  arla  and  sharu  came in, and we all waited like an hour for  jo  to come.. haha she got lost on the bus. scary thing.. i was in short shorts and a t-shirt because i had been setting stuff up on the deck, so i just jumped in the car with my dad to pick up jo from an intersection. and so i got out of the car and it must have seemed obvious i was looking for someone because this group of gino-looking guys were looking at me and this one guy goes "hey are you looking for me?" and im like "excuse me?" and he goes "every girl is looking for prince charming. i could be yours." what a creep! it was so  weird . :D at least i wasnt wearing my "looking for prince charming" shirt. :D speaking of that shirt.. we tried to get quoc to wear it but he wouldnt. :( boys.. such party poopers.  haha then im like "quoc youre a chicken!!" and he goes "no im not!" so i put my hand under my chin and go "chicken!!" and gwen goes "uh leanne.. thats a turkey." so i put my hand on top of my head, and she goes ".. thats rooster." haha then arla goes "hey this is monkey!" and does a monkey move.. and gwen goes "ooh this is elephant!!" :D and before you know it, there was a menagerie of exotic african elephants, giraffes, and the like in my own living room.  so after we picked up jo and everyone had changed, we had a mad water balloon fight. :( i forgot the watergun!! but it was great anyway. i had ONE SHOT at quoc.. and i nailed him. he was soaked. he threw like ten balloons at me.. and missed. haha im such a pro. so then back to my place for food..  i knew my mom always overestimated cooking. its like this: you want a lot more, you say you want a little more. you want a little more, you say you want no more. say you would like a lot more.. youre not going to see the next dawn. youll have died of asphyxiation as she force-fed you every edible thing on the planet. but good lord.. we had grilled chicken drumsticks, spring rolls, shrimp rings [my personal favorite], noodles.. everything. and drinks galore. :D i set up a sort of serve-yourself bar on a shelf on the porch. it was so romantic, almost.. we had one 3-tiered candle rack, and two floating candle vases.. and candles were just burning as we ate on the porch.. i dont know. i couldnt have asked for more. as i was sitting there, just listening to the jibber-jabber of happy people.. it hit me. i just felt how fortunate i am to have people i know care for me. just to have friends, and to be able to be in their company. its one of those things you never really consider.. but when you do,you realize how lucky you are. it must be a truly horrible thing, to be lonely.  then after all that eating, people requested a recovery interval before tackling cake, ice cream, and fruit platters. we were going to watch  hidalgo .. at least i wanted to. but then someone said "hey do you have any of those chinese movies?" and we had one on hand.. this chinese comedy called  teppenyaki .. its one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen, with the weirdest, most illogical plotline ever concieved by a chinese filmmaker. and thats saying a lot. essentially, the main character is married to the daughter of his boss, and is always caught flirting with people who come to the restaurant where he works. and one time he sees a calendar girl he has fallen in love with, and he challenges her date to a tennis match. he practices with a wok and onions. 100 onions per day, to be precise. he ends up winning the tennis match, using a wok. then he travels to the phillipines with girl.. and his grandfather, wife, best friend, and father-in-law. the rest is predictable, more or less. see what i mean? no plot whatsoever. but everyone loved it for some reason.. especially arla and gwen.. something about foreign films, i think they said.  then back to the porch for  career charades  and  things .. best games ever. :D so entertaining. then we did cake cutting, candle blowing, picture taking, the whole nine yards. then back inside for present opening. our numbers were decimated by half after present opening, since most people had to go home around 10-ish. the remaining horde went to the porch to play cards. it was kind of chilly, so we brought out my "watching movies" blankie to keep warm. it was so nice though.. the candles burning, wrapped up in a blankie, playing cards and talking. it was so funny because we were playing president, and the ass and vice ass had to do a dare decided by the president.. i had to do a romance scene with quoc.. something about him saving me in an alleyway. :D so lame.. lol there were so many kodak moments, but i was forbidden to use wilbur for documentation purposes.  ooh and we had fortune cookies. we did the immature thing of adding "in bed" to the end of each fortune. ill let you figure these ones out:     you display the wonderful traits of charm and courtesy.    you will be fortunate in everything you put your hands to.    now is the time to try something new.    you are kind-hearted and hospitable, cheerful and well-liked.    you love chinese food.    you constantly struggle for self improvement.    sing and rejoice, fortune is smiling on you.    you will travel far and wide for both pleasure and business.     of course, wilbur was by my side this whole time. i think i have almost a hundred pictures.. haha thats what i get for appointing danna as cameraperson. but its nice to have all of those pictures anyway. i just dont know how we could have taken that many.. amazing.  :D im happy.. lots happening this week. i have gwens party tomorrow!! cant wait for that. :D i have no idea how to get there, so im meeting quoc at his place, then were going to pick up tina and go there. then im going pubbing [yes, that is pubbing, not clubbing] with corina, jessica, and maria on friday.. were going to scour the pubs of toronto for hot british guys. well, just go to one and hope that well be able to find a few. :D might get lucky. then shopping, hopefully. urgh and work on wednesday and saturday.  im so sad.. because theres going to be a church get-together on the 29th.. like 50 people are going. and i have to go since i taught the youngest class of sunday school kids. haha not that that s a bad thing! keep reading. :D i want to see them all again.. we stopped classes in june and are resuming in september. theyre all such sweet kids.. and theyre so special to me. it helps put life in perspective, dealing with kids. like i asked them one time what they thought love was, how it was expressed. most of them said it was by if somebody hugged you and kissed you and such. but one of my kids, a little boy who was kind of reclusive, said "love is knowing somebody cares when they look at you. you can see their eyes. like when my mom tucks me in. i look at her eyes and i can tell." it was just those simple words that put my entire life back into perspecive. i need those kids in my life the same way they treat me as a mentor and teacher. children are the best teachers, sometimes. :D and i think some of the altar boys are coming.. so itll be good to see them all again.  whoa.. i totally strayed there. so anyway.. the 29th is also the same day as the annual party my supervisor throws at her place for pages.. and its doubling as a going-away party for arla. :( but now.. i have a clash. i hate when that happens. i will have to work things out.  i will be uploading pictures on a msn groups page sometime.. ill give the link when i get it done. but over 100 pics.. that could take awhile.  - L.

        ooh i love birthdays.. especially when theyre mine. blogging in  orange , my favorite colour. :D if you cant read it, thats your problem. got most of the big preparations done.. moved deck chairs and such to the porch, mom making food.. most of the cleaning. the only thing i cant do.. streamers. who the hell invented STREAMERS anyway? :D i think im just pissed that i cant decorate for my life. its horrible, really. theres a lot of little things like that that some guys think every girl should be able to do.. decorate, do origami, etc.       i think i come across as a major disappointment to any guy who thinks i can be very delicate. :( im not even very good at tying up balloons. but i guess thats who i am, and what ill have to be accepted for.      i dont really feel any different, being 16. just.. it feels so good to say that. "im 16!" as gwen said, its "15, only better." at 3:01 AM, i was officially 16. how great is that? :D and i slept right through it.      i got SO MANY ecards from people.. even one from a friend who moved to nova scotia!! it was so sweet.. im so touched. thanks to all of you. but one of them stood out in particular. i think that this card takes the cake for the sweetest thing anyones ever done for me.. except for one other thing which i wont get into.  davis  made me a card using flash.. heres the link, i  have  to share this:      urlLink  http://www.ecf.utoronto.ca/~doand/Pikachu/photoshop/hbdayLT.html     basically its pictures of all the things on my wishlist, with captions and such. it was just so sweet because he seemed to know me so well. haha all these pictures are more or less copywrited.. so lets hope he doesnt go to jail over this! lol he even stole his company name..  pikachu engineerings .      thanks to everyone for making this a special day for me. :) and bigups to  davis  for the card.. ;) remember, youre not  that  old.      - L.      p.s. about that email you sent me, davis.. ;) youll get leanne points for quantity, if not quality.

       :D blogging the day before my birthday. its tomorrow! haha im happy. went shopping today for last minute stuff.. plastic cutlery, paper plates, chips, etc. :D im gonna have floating candles and such.. to create a mood. :D and psychadelic hawaiian music.  talking to  davis , a young man who has forgotten his manners. just messages me going "blah blah.. running for blah blah.. campaign blah blah.." :D so i made him say "hey leanne, how are you doing?" and now im giving him some leanne-approved advice.  got my new glasses, and a raging headache to go with it. it was so funny because i picked them up before going to church [which is near my optical], so im walking to church. i must have looked kind of drunk or something.. it was weird because im used to having unlimited [if slightly blurry] vision with rimless glasses, and all of a sudden theres this black box around everything. this old woman came up to me and asked me if i was ok.. i think she thought i had been drinking a bit.  my heads been pounding.. i dont know if its because im adjusting to the new glasses or what. :( it sucks major ass. so heres what i look like now:       urlLink          good lord i look like a nerd..      - L.

        and i guess it was  okay . i was kind of expecting more spy-ness, but its all good. haha everyones probably like "you mean you just watched it?" .. yup. im very behind on the times.. i have yet to watch  a walk to remember , all of  swordfish ,  casablanca , you get the idea. one day ill have a massive movie marathon of every "ive wanted to watch it but ive never had the time or i forgot" movie.        talking to  simon l  and  ryan  right now.. i never kept in touch with most of the DEEP alumni from last year, but this year.. i dunno, it seems like a lot of people are chatting with me when i log on. i just realized something.. every guy likes to be pampered over at least a little. i was just talking to a friend of mine on the phone, and he was trying to be all tough about this cut he got while renovating his house.      so i go "aww.. its ok. just make sure you clean it up properly and bandage it." i told him id bring  oreos  over sometime.. its funny because he was like "im a guy. i dont do  oreos ." but i think hes lying. ;) come on.. if any guys are reading this, you have to agree. why else get a girlfriend? just to have someone to spoil you rotten if you ever get a boo-boo.       mm.. i love this song.  trust me [this is love]  by amanda marshall.. the lyrics are just so perfect. if youre one of those people who always seem to find yourself in an off-on relationship, you could relate. highly recommended for downloading.      i like this colour. its the colour of a perfect iced cap. at least it looks that way on my computer. :D if it comes out looking orangey-brownish on yours, thats your problem. urgggggh.. im out.      - L.

       i accidently typed in  urlLink booger.com   .. without school, i feel my typing skills have been going downhill. im adding "e"s where theyre not needed, and leaving out entire words when typing long emails and such. :D so if that happens, ever, use your imagination and fill in the blanks.  i want to upload a picture to my profile but dont know how to do that.. i will have to send a question to the  urlLink blogger.com    staff.  something kind of funny-scary happened today.. so im talking to my mom and i go "yeah, this is probably the last birthday party ill have.. im getting to old for this." she got really  really  serious after i said this, and goes "go wash your mouth with soap." and i go "no way.. thats so weird." and she goes "okay then, drink a glass of water." then she explained to me how her family thinks saying that anything is your last anything means youll die before it comes around. i.e. your last birthday party, your last golf game, etc. i got horribly spooked after that. my moms like that.. she believes in a rare assortment of things, but she believes very strongly in those few things. catholicism and this whole "last activity" thing being at the top of that list. so there you go, my daily dose of freaked out.  so i was at work today.. nothing much happened. :( so sad because  arla , this girl i work with, is leaving to got  mcmaster  and wont be working at the library anymore. it wont seem the same without her. so were having a going-away party for her at my supervisors house.. should be fun.  funny thing.. today i was on the bus going home, and there was a slight breeze coming through the window. this girls boyfriend gives her his white jacket, but he goes "make sure you dont get it dirty.. that jacket cost me a fortune." i was just thinking "what the hell is your problem?" i mean, you give something to somebody in the hopes that theyll keep warm.. and you care about it getting dirty? and it was more the tone of his voice.. almost like he was scolding a child instead of just telling her. i wouldnt be surprised if there was some sort of abuse going on in that relationship, if only verbal.  if i ever get seriously involved with anyone, i think thats one of the things i will  never  put up with. i couldnt stand somebody breathing down my back, belittling me. its funny.. i would want to be part of a relationship, the half of a whole. but i would still want to be my own seperate entity, something that could survive outside of that two-person world. you always see those couples who are "john and jane," instead of just one or the other.  i dont know if i could ever be that comfortable relying on somebody else. or if i could survive knowing that i was seen as a part of something, as a component that couldnt function on its own. i could never be that girl, regardless of whether or not the jacket is dry-clean only.       "my moneys riding on this dark horse, baby   my heart is sayin its the lucky one   and its true colors gonna shine through someday   if we let this dark horse run..      and i believe   something so sacred   is something worth this kind of fight..   so rare, so sweet.."     - L.

       ok well so today i went to visit my mum at work.. she works in the  sunlife building  on king, right across from  peel pub . so anyway, im sitting in the car with my dad as were waiting for her to come meet us, and the announcer on the radio is talking about the olympics.. something about canada getting the silver in trampoline.  now before i blog, something everyone reading this should know about my dad.. hes very into efficiency. hes the kind of guy who, if he was preparing dinner for a date, would be making a salad while calling a florist and barbequing a steak at the same time. so he goes "you know, leanne, canada should be like china.. send less people, make more gold." i think a lot of asian people [at least the older generation] are like that.. its either gold or nothing. i mean, silver and bronze are nice, but what is there to brag about? "oh you remember my son, william.. he has the  third-highest  average in his class." somehow doesnt have the same ring.  and apparently PING PONG is now an olympics sport. i guess the politically correct term is "table tennis." now, my aunt used to be something of a legend in terms of ping pong.. enough trophies to make your head spin. so dad goes "ha! ping pong! china is going to win every trophy! china is ping pong king." i guess its one of those "you had to be there" things, but.. i tell you i thought i would cough my lungs up, i was laughing so hard.  its just the sheer "its impossible for anyone else to win" opinion of my dad. like the one time when i saw something about a math competition in  the toronto star , i go to my dad "there was a math competition yesterday, and no chinese people ranked in the first three positions." my dad just shot me a knowing smile over his daily cup of java and whispered "youre lying. i do not  believe ."  ooh boy. i think i will be having hell if i dont make something useful of myself. it has already begun.. the beginning of the end. my cousin is going to  mcmaster  this fall. i have four cousins in california.. one has recently become an optometrist, and another is getting his phd in biomedical engineering and is helping to conduct clinical trials on a biologically-based electrode that could quite possibly make him a very rich man. a third one is studying computer engineering, and the fourth one is already a mini-genius in the making.  sometimes its almost overwhelming, in fact. im surrounded by brilliant intelligence, by dazzling creativity, by near perfection. my family, mostly, and occasionally my friends. sometimes i step back and think "what the hell am i doing among these people?" i feel almost sinfully inadequate. im just a simple, simple person with attainable aspirations. im not looking into where ill be ten years from now. im taking it one step at a time.. first this year of high school, then the next, then university. it seems oh so far away.  its not that im some sort of slob who has no idea where her life is going. its just that, at this point in my life, i dont  care . im satisfied with knowing that my average is steady and high enough to please myself. but i think if anything motivates me, its my parents. when my cousin told us that she had been accepted by  mcmaster , my dad squeezed my hand and whispered "dont worry, pumpkin. you will have your turn in two years. and when it comes, i think you will surprise even  yourself ."  how do i answer to that? its not a heavy pressure, its not like theyre forcing me to do anything i dont want to. its more like a quiet assurance.. like they know that it will happen. not "if," but "when." its the sort of pressure you cant argue with, like telling a kid who  knows  hell get a certain toy that his parents cant afford it. i just hope that, when all of this really matters, i will be good enough to have measured up.  - L.

       the photo uploading software at  urlLink blogger.com . you have to download a program called  hello  as well as a photo album program called  picasa  in order to upload pictures. it makes it a bit easier, i guess, just that every time i want to upload a picture i have to open the damn program. and if im on another computer i cant upload pictures to my blog without downloading the program onto  that  computer. boo.      so heres a random picture of me..    urlLink        oh well, blogging services are like people, i guess. they all have their downfalls, their shortcomings. :D im getting new glasses on sunday, and my birfdays on monday. :D ill have to take pictures galore with wilbur. cant wait!      - L.

       ok so basically  urlLink blog.com  failed me. theyre doing some sort of "beta testing," whatever the heck that is, and theyre supposedly sending "activation codes" to all members who signed up "up to today." i didnt get it, so i filled out a thing that would send it to me. i did this like 3 times. i gave up.       all im asking for is a good blog server. one that doesnt bail out on me the minute i post something, and one that has a decent commenting service. is it really all that much to ask?       some things to blog about..      so two days ago i was at work, and im shelving books in the kids section. there were like 4 or 5 little girls around 8 years old sitting in a circle talking about a party they were going to this weekend. so one girl goes "i want to wear high heels, but then ill be taller than marcus and its weird to be taller than a guy." and another girl goes "i want to shave my legs, but my mom wont let me. i might get that stuff you just put on your legs and it gets rid of your hair." and a third girl goes "i got this really nice eye shadow.. its kind of like glittery. and i went shopping with my mom and she bought me really short booty shorts."      i was just sitting back, half-laughing my ass off and half-wanting to cry. i mean, when i was that age, i was still climbing trees dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. these girls were all wearing short shorts and mini skirts. what the hell is happening in this world? i mean, i see little boys swearing like sailors, and these girls are ready to dress provocatively before theyre even in middle school. these are KIDS. they should be outside playing, not inside painting their nails and worrying about makeup.      sometimes i just dont know what society is coming to. have we really boxed our children into such a tight spot, where they have to dress and talk a certain way? where they have to be adults before theyve finished becoming children? thats just disgusting.      - L.
