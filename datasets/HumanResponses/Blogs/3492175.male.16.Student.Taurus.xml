      Ok, today was good, for the most part. Got them drums, and discovered i am better than i thought i was. I saw Rachel for the last time for a long time which was very sad, and then to top that off i think i forgot to say a parting message of love. well, hopefully she'll read this and know i meant to. meh. i ate alot today, but thats really only interesting to me. also i discovered that Karl Marx was the man, and i should definetly figure out how to grow up like THAT. and learn to live in the woods, that would be fun.  Heres an awesome quote from my mom: "Dont worry, Just scrape the top off and eat the rest" - on the subject of 2 month old ice cream.  i guess its ok to just write in here, so ill ramble a bit. if you dont care, you can tune out at this point, the important things are said...i think. meh. i miss people already. I wish we all lived in the same place. dancing is good. very good. yeah, my ramble got lost in my head. try waking up thinking of someone you love. it gives a bright outlook on the day.

      Well, considering the ease of posting and editing ill probably do this alot. oh well. im boring so ill start with my day. woke up early for a summer day, like 11:30. but that was only becasue my phone beeped. should have rung, but its one of the ancient startac phones. whatever. then i sorted my belongings for several hours. kinda sobering to look through all your old stuff. i also taught my little cousin erik (a mere 1.5 years old) to do a high five, to say Moop (there you go Ace), and to throw rocks at parked cars. the last may have been an oversight. oh well. Murphyus started the "Canada fund" to get me up to visit during summer. hope that works, casue that would be awesome.

      I LOVE ANDREW MURPHY!!!!   in other news i have begun construction of victory cave. this will be a complex tunnel sysetem beginning under my house...so i can have something to do. i need resources on building caves and mines, and on construction in general (particuarly on supports) so any help would be appreciated...yeah  eventually this will be the home of my underground society. so clearly i will be holding the title of "supreme lord"  craig is already viceroy and luke is Grand Vizzer (though he doesnt know yet, thank craig, he promoted you on that one)  post your desired  titles in comments so i can reserve a spot for you ...canada out.   edit: i will post plans for it in later entries...and dont forget the wank equation M=8-(2*I) where m = number of wanks per week and I=number of times you get it on with someone special...or just someone i suppose....

      yeah, at dinner today i overheard the best conversation ever. this woman says "im going to hell, but we should blow something up...like washington" she then proceeded to explain how DC had become the origin of all teh ignorance in the world. woo for her.  where the hell is andrew? oh man, i keep missing him. bla.  yay maya! i cont remeber if i posted this in my last entry but your the man. hehe, my comment prolly didnt work cause blogger was freaking out but it was basically me using deductive reasoning to determine that a yam was indeed maya casue of many reasons, the biggest being the fact that a yam is maya backwards.  i have decided to become a freelance cartographer. canada out.

      yeah, so rachel went away to camp land for long time. yeah. there goes my one remaining link to the outside world. wonderful. hope she has a good time though :)  as for me, my existance is uneventful. sometimes i go outside and play football with my brothers...but only sometimes. luke comes soom, thats good. then at least i can have some intellegent conversation.  last night i realized how much fun it was to convince my brothers to fight and watch it for fun. i invited all the neighborhood kids. I wonder why i stopped doing that? oh, yeah...concern for others. meh. who needs that, hehe. it got pretty brutal when harry gave thomas a shot to the cojones and then he went into a blood frenzy. actually the latter was pretty cool, in a horror movie kind of way.  my father has somehow convinced me to do research for him online. he should pay me. but why should he? all the local businesses have already determined i am not worth paying. damn, well, candar out.

      Time for the first good night of sleep ive gotten in weeks. Wish i had called Rachel today. nothing interesting happened recently. i wonder if this will work...  the blogs of interest make me seem uninteresting. too bad im not some suffering kid in kuait who can use a blog. then id be interesting. man, people have their hearts in the wrong places. i wonder if thats a recent thing. oh well. G'night.

      Rachel, you are the best person i have ever known. i was freaking out today casue im turing into a slug, but after a 15 minute talk with you online i am completely reivitalized, and suddenly optimistic. i try on my own but you let me soar. it may seem like i am just helping you get along, but you help me more than I can ever properly express. i dont even know what to say. yeah, and i hope you are happy, after writing that i can never act macho. ;) so yeah, i love you alot.  but anyway im bored. and thats saying something becasue i can  watch cars go by for hours without being bored. i think i am turing into a puddle. but its really this place that does it. there is nothing and no one here. i love my family but i already know them really well. they are the most interesting part of my unintersting existance, and thats bad, cause i know every thing on earth about these guys. theyre like...my family or something!  aaagh. oh well. some kid i havent talked to in 8 months who lives in woschter or however you spell it said i was his idol. thats so sweet! oh, but hes 14...oh well, hes a good kid. And special thanks to that random guy who posted in my last thing...im sorry your life sucks, but you have slightly improved mine by posting a comment when i dont know you!  in other news me and my brothers got the Radio machine ace found in a dumpster to work. turns out it gets color tv signals. we powered it by rigging up an old phones AC adapter to fit in the hole. i was proud of me. some of you saw that machine, and its impressive that it gets fox and nbc in full color relatively clearly...and free, did i mention totaly free?  but yeah. my stomach hurts ow. i think ill go to bed.  oh and on another note, if anyone in the world would pay me to make them a professional website i can do that cause im good at it AND i really need money. so yeah. cool.

      tohellandback88: so what ur ideas on humans redpester: uh, in what sense? tohellandback88: in behavior tohellandback88: like people are to hipacritical redpester: well, people really are alot of things. were repetative and stupid, and we fight and kill eachother for stupid made up reasons, but in the end were better than everything else for 3 reasons: redpester: a) we can do math tohellandback88: yea redpester: b)we are relatively large tohellandback88: true redpester: and most importantly redpester: c)we have opposable thumbs tohellandback88: i agree.... bnut one other thing people are is hippacritical and annoying.... people always no matter what say one thing and do the other it hate it some god damn much, but worse is that u can't stop doin it if u hate it. We're annoying cause we do things and than try 2 fix it and fuck it up worse... also we do things at the most inopertune time redpester: see the thing about that is we forget we are only animals. we cant help but live in the present, and therefore cannot possibly not fuck things up. and also we invent abstract concepts to attatche ourseves to and as such are hypocritical simply becasue these ideas are at a base level irrational and we know that and expect others to call us on it, though sinse all people do this if you were to get over it you would be breaking the cycle of hypocracy tohellandback88: that just the what i have been thingin and now u put it in to words 4 me... nice! redpester: quite!  well, i nust conclude i am slightly more literate, however, this boys SOUL resonates like a shining star. please *ahem* leave pleasant and constructive comments on his journal. and make sure to not you know me, he'll get a kick out of that.  urlLink  heres Jeremy!    oh, and the entire conversation came out of nowhere, i was all like, yeah, i like music and stuff, and he was like what about humans? and so it began, woo.

      Agh, i am so tired. i would appear to have cought something of a cold, but its more likely my allergies, so they wont go away. bla. i spent all of yesterday sleeping becasue i was soooooo exhausted. and my eyes were itchy. man, what an unpleasant ailment.  boy howdy i wish i got my job. but alas, no such luck. all of a sudden my dad has started going a little bit crazy and keeps trying to get me to apply for jobs i am A) not allowed to do, or B)not qualified to do, or my favorite C) really dont want to do. AHHHH!!! why wont the damn lazer place hire me! im so good at that! i dont want to end up working at Rax!!!(for any of you who dont know, rax is the south's equivalent to an underfunded macdonalds. you can almost smell the sleaze coming off the place...and i think theyre hiring)  Meh, i wanted to talk to people las night, but i was sleeping...however, the french comment rachel left proved to be most entertaining in literal form:  my expensive, I t'aime has the insane one. you misses me much because you are the only one which could make me laugh when badly j'avais times my beautiful love, I think always has you.  hmmm...i hope thats what it really translates to, casue then french would be the best language ever. well, back to Morrowind then..oh right, i got morrowind working. badly, but i can play! haha, in your face mimimum requirements and U.S. Law! i need niether a good computer or money to play video games anymore!

      no, i dont mean that. come play with me. hehe. I reconnected with a bunch of my old friends from middle school online tonight. it was awesome. my friend sarah who i havent talked to in AGES (like 3 or 4 years) independantly of andrew started a "max fund" and thats what she called it too. so now i have 2 people trying to get me to hang out with them by fundinhg my trip. woo. my other buddy matt tried to convince me to stow away on a plane and hed pick me up in reno. Hes gone a bit crazy since i left, but thats a good thing i think. we need more crazy people. then i had a conversation with me old best friend Justin, who is the man. i havent laughed that hard since i can remember. him and jay lenno make my...er...2 in the morning. yeah, that was awesome.  then they left, all of em. bla. so i went and read a bunch of rachels old deadjournals, which is kinda creepy and stalkerish but its early and im bored. then i took a quiz i found within. yay       You're M. Gillenormand!       Who you are:  Marius's wacky maternal grandfather.  This is your life:  You brought the kid up with the aid of your spinster daughter, gave him all the advantages, and then he ran off on you.  Hmph.  Nevertheless, you're ridiculously fond of him.

      yes, yes its true. my foolish school did give me a maxtor 09..something drive in their wacky computer thing. and it works too! (i know becasue i tested it on my AWESOME windows 95 computer) yeah, nobody really needs to know what that means, but it pleased me. and in other techno-babble news my bloody enormous Morrowind download finished. looks like my 2 peers came through, granted they did have like 50.3% average each, so i was all set. and then i left it on to seed! how cool am i!..and that game is going to rock.  also i went to annoy the people who i want to hre me again so that they wouldnt forget me from yesterday. that was loads of fun. now i hget to hunt down some guy in the zoo named mr mikey or something like that. why is getting a job turning into a mystery novel? meh.  it has just occured to me that mabye i should only write in here when something interesting happens. but wheres the fun in that!  yeah, also i spent the remainder of my time thinking about all the time where i was having more fun than i was at that current moment. meaning that i thought alot about my birthday party, which was the single funnest thing ever. yeah, pretty much makes up for any badness in the world i think. mabye thats the meaning of life, hey, to have one incredible experience, and then using that as motivation bring others that moment. well, made sense in my mind anyway. and yay for me, this is the LONGEST entry ever! and we get pizza tonight! so yeah, today was pretty good.

Meh. the world is gone to shit.  Actually probably not. other than that and the fact that im in bloody west virginia it all makes enough sense. oh well, im got a good rant out there, so everybodyh wins i guess. also, shaving is really annoying. whose crap idea was beards anyway.(well, theyre kinda fun on other people, but not me.)
