      Gay wedding mania continues to sweep the country. As announced Thursday, the mayor of New Paltz, New York performed marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.  Twenty-one couples were married just a few miles north of New York city.  Although Governor Pataki tried to have the ceremonies stayed, the state attorney general declined.  Governors just aren't having much luck with their attorney generals these days.  I wonder if they're all getting, "not tonight governor, I have a headache."  I must admit that whatever the reason or final legal standing of these marriages, I'm enjoying this form of protest and display of support for gay rights.  Plenty of people are getting upset over public officials not upholding the laws, but this ver much feels of the love-ins of the 60's and the non-violent protest tactics of Dr. King and others.    I engaged in a brief discussion with a radio personality who said that Mayor Newsom of San Francisco should be arrested. This person asked me if I would be upset if some mayor in Alabama flaunted the law and started arresting gay people because of their sexuality.  Wouldn't I want this mayor stopped and arrested?  Of course I would.  I believe that if any of these elected officials are breaking the law, they should be prepared to face the appropriate legal ramification. However, it is still a far cry from marrying someone to throwing someone in jail for no legitimate reason.  No person is being hurt in these marriages.  The couples involved likely understand that their official status could be yanked away at any time.    So, if you're going to San Francisco, be sure to register at William-Sonoma.

      The Reverend Edward Frost, senior minister of the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of Atlanta, wrote in a recent op-ed piece in the Atlanta Journal Constitution:  "The state's position is that it makes laws for the public good, and marriage, the "bedrock" of our national public health and well being, is in grave danger. The president says this "sacred institution between a man and a woman" must be preserved at all costs.  To that, let me just say this: Britney Spears.  It isn't necessary to jump through the state's hoops to enjoy, as George Eliot wrote, "two human souls joined together to strengthen each other." But if being married means a public declaration to enter into a long-term partnership, share responsibilities and care for each other, then marriage provides a vase to hold those promises and intentions, and helps preserve and support them.  Why should John and George, or Harriet and Julia, not enjoy for the rest of their lives together all the rights, privileges and protections Britney and Jason enjoyed for 55 hours?  Because homosexual relationships are an abomination in the sight of God? What is in the sight of God is in the eyes of the beholder and ought to have nothing to do with what is legal or illegal.  Because same-sex marriage would undermine and devalue traditional marriage? Please. People have been doing that for centuries.  Because the Bible, the Quran, our sacred Scriptures do not support marriage between men or between women? This suggests our laws ought to be grounded in religious faith.  The ground of law, at least in a democratic state, is the agreement of the majority of the citizens. Therefore, laws stating that marriage must only be between a man and a woman are based on common agreement -- much as were the laws saying people of color could not drink out of certain water fountains, or that women could not vote.  I've been around long enough to remember how unthinkable it was, for most people, that people of different races -- or even different religions -- would marry. There is nothing absolute about marriage being only between a man and a woman. Whatever laws there are asserting such a thing are not ordained of God or grounded in nature, but are expressive of public views and values. And public views and values change when enough citizens change their opinions."   Read the full article  urlLink here .

      The inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty identifies her as "Mother of Exiles."  Along similar lines, Jesus of Nazareth was well known to have included the excluded. He brought the love of God to people declared unclean and social outcasts.  George W. Bush, 43rd President of the United States, who claims identification as both an American citizen and Christian believer, betrayed both his nationality and faith on  urlLink Tuesday, February 24, 2004 .    President Bush, in his official biography is noted as the former governor of Texas who "earned a reputation as a compassionate conservative who shaped public policy based on the principles of limited government, personal responsibility, strong families, and local control. "  On February 24, Mr. Bush decimated his own record as being compassionate and an advocate of limited government and local control.  Conservatives have traditionally favored reducing the power and influence of the federal government. Mr. Bush ran on a campaign continuing that traditional stance. However, Mr. Bush obviously has no qualms about also abandoning his political heritage and philosophy.  This past Tuesday, Mr. Bush became the first president to publicly call for the restriction of civil liberties against one particular group of citizens.  Mr. Bush held a special press conference to specifically denounce homosexual Americans and proclaim them a second rate citizens and not worth basic human liberties. The President attempts to hide his bigotry and intolerance by pretending his actions do not impact the dignity, worth, and citizenship of American citizens:  "Our government should respect every person and protect the institution of marriage. There is no contradiction between these responsibilities. We should also conduct this difficult debate in a matter worthy of our country, without bitterness or anger. "  The President slaps every gay American in the face and then calls for a debate without "bitterness or anger." Mr. Bush, you will not get that debate.  I, and plenty of other gay Americans have every right to be outraged and indignant at this declaration of war on our persons.  We will not be silent and passive on this issue; we are, to use a famous movie line, "mad as hell and not going to take it any more."  Mr. Bush, you seek to keep us captive to your ideals of what is right and wrong. You seek to keep us captive to the moral imperatives of the religious right. You seek to keep us captives in our own nation.  Mr. Bush, you will find that, like Lady Liberty's torch, you have captured lightning. And this lightning will strike a thousand times over.  The call to defend marriage is not a new one. This same call was used as recently as 1967, when interracial marriage was illegal. Interracial marriage could cause you to be arrested in some states. Public opinion showed opposition to permitting interracial marriage.  Allowing blacks and whites to marry would lead to the break-down of the institution of marriage. A Virginia judge declared that God intended to separate the races and upheld a ban on interracial marriage.  The first time the ban on marriage was struck down in any state was in the same state where such laws are being challenged today, California. The California Supreme Court decided that such a ban made us "human beings...bereft of worth and dignity."  Years later the United States Supreme Court decided that marriage is a "vital personal right" and that it belongs to all Americans.  Today, we have a president that would strip us of that right.  I wonder if the President and his supporters would just as quickly smear the judges on the 1967 Supreme Court with the term "activist judges."  These judges, and especially the Californian judges, went against popular opinion. They went agains what many felt was the will of God. Were they "activists"? And if they were, was it such a bad thing? Were judges who allowed black children to attend the same school as white children "activist judges"?  Mr. Bush, in his limited intelligence, likes to hang on phrases he thinks sound profound.  As typical, the phrase is utterly meaningless. Judges on a daily basis interpret law and redefine how those laws are applied in court cases.  The Massachusetts Supreme Court did nothing different than they do on any other day, except deliver a decision that is unpopular with the President and religious right.  The President stated, like many of the religious Right, that the amendment is necessary to protect the institution and definition of marriage.  Like his supporters, Mr. Bush has failed to identify how exactly gay marriage undermines this institution.   When Press Secretary Scott McClellan was asked to  urlLink clarify  exactly how the President sees gay marriage as being undermined, he offered no further information.  Indeed, I've yet to hear an explanation, satisfactory or otherwise, on how same-sex marriage damages marriage.  What exactly is the President trying to protect? Mr. Bush calls marriage "the most fundamental institution of civilization." He also is trying to "prevent the meaning of marriage from being changed forever."  I'm curious to which meaning and which particular institution the President is defending? Is he trying to defend the polygamous marriages of the Old Testament or the business-contractual arranged marriages of the New? If Mr. Bush finds a religious reason to combat same-sex marriage, shouldn't he take the  urlLink advice  of the Apostle Paul and work diligently to prevent marriage all together? In these same verses, Saint Paul advocates no remarriage after divorce and complete subjugation of the wife to the husband.  Would Mr. Bush like to re-enact American laws that denied married women property and voting rights?  Perhaps the President seeks to protect the institution that brings us "The Bachelor", "Married By America", "The Littlest Groom", "I Married a Millionaire"? Perhaps he wants to protect the Michael Jackson / Lisa Marie Presley or Britney Spears /Jason Alexander institution?  Or perhaps the President is slightly too late to keep the meaning of marriage from changing. Perhaps the President fears change, but as Henry David Thoreau once said, "...in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor accident."  Perhaps the President really has no strong conviction on the issue, but sees it as an opportune diversion from more pressing issues such as the intelligence debacle on the weapons of mass destruction, the continued occupation of Iraq, the continued loss of American lives in Iraq, the failure to institute a stable government in Iraq, the slumped economy, or the net loss of jobs the President will experience over his tenure.  Perhaps the President's only conviction is a complete lack of conscious about toying with people's lives for his own political gain.  The notoriously even-keeled Senator Rick Santorum (a name I think would look fine upon a mental institution: the Santorum Sanitarium), recently  urlLink revealed  the truth about marriage: "Marriage is not about affirming somebody's love for somebody else. It's about uniting together to be open to children, to further civilization in our society." Sorry to step on anybody's fairy tale romance there. I suppose the Senator would favor a ban on marriage between infertile heterosexuals, or just those who, unaware of marriage's true purpose, chose not to have children.  I don't entirely disagree with the Senator, however.  I don't need a government to recognize my love for my husband. I don't need a court to declare my commitment to another man. What I need is the ability to go through life with the man I love with the same rights and responsibilities that any other married couple would have. I need the government to ensure that when he is sick, I will get to see him in the hospital. I need our employers to give us the same benefits they give to married couples.  I need to protection to make sure the house we both invested in goes to the other one upon the death of the other.  I need basic life assurances that any other loving, and even non-loving, (and I must add non-procreative) couple receives from the government.   At one point I was content with the idea of civil unions giving us those benefits. Yet even this issue was fought by conservatives and the Religious Right.  Their unwillingness to compromise has shown me that anything other than full marriage bestowed upon me by the federal government is at best a "separate but equal" arrangement. An arrangement that our highest court has already decided is unconstitutional.  Anything less than my right to marry another man in any state I choose and travel to any other state and have that marriage recognized makes me a second-class citizen.  Anything less denies me of rights the Supreme Court has already stated I should have.  Recently, the President laughingly  urlLink proclaimed  that "No president had done more for human rights" than he had.  Perhaps he is correct. Perhaps he has finally put such pressure on the gay community that we are no longer willing to be captive to our second class citizen status. Perhaps he will have given us unprecedented human rights, even if we have to snatch them out of his hands.

      About two weeks ago, the Human Right Campaign advocated calling the White House comment line because the news was that the President was on the verge of announcing his support for a Constitutional amendment (looks like they were correct, unfortunately).  Below is the text I read to the operator I spoke with. I was cut off after a certain amount of time, so the part I was able to articulate is bolded.  If you would like to call the White House on this or any other issue of importance, the number is 202-456-1111   It has come to my understanding that the President is prepared to fully endorse and lend his support to the Musgrave anti-marriage amendment to the US Constitution.  I am requesting that the President refuse to support this or any other such amendment.  This amendment is blatant act of discrimination and bigotry against gay Americans. This amendment is morally and civilly wrong.  This amendment seeks to classify gay and lesbian American citizens as having fewer rights and protections than other American citizens.  President Bush has in the past identified himself as being compassionate, a defender of human civil liberties, and a man of God.  His endorsement of this amendment invalidates all of those claims.  This amendment restricts civil liberties and would be the first amendment to do so in American history .   Most Americans do not support a constitutional amendment on this issue. President Bush has always claimed to be representing the values of the American people. Americans do not value this amendment.  Americans realize that more pressing issues face us today such as the economy,  the hunting of terrorists, and finishing the war in Iraq.  I ask President Bush to return his focus on these important issues, which are the true concerns of American citizens.  This amendment is Anti-American as well as Anti-Christian.  The religious right does not speak for all or even most Christians in America.  This amendment is hateful and Jesus did not preach hate. If President Bush considers himself Christian, he will immediately separate himself from this amendment.  Again, I repeat that President Bush, as the leader of our great nation, should not lend any degree of support to the Musgrave anti-marriage amendment which promotes a homophobic agenda and seeks to deny productive, loving, and stable American citizens our proper rights and protections.

      Leonard Pitts is one of my favorite columnists. He presents a fairly liberal viewpoint in a very reasonable, level-headed manner.  He is always thought provoking.  Here's one of his recent  urlLink articles  on the gay marriage activity going on currently.   Tired of waiting, gay couples decided to act   It 's a little-known fact that Martin Luther King Jr. didn't really lead the March on Washington. What actually happened is that the marchers, a quarter million strong, grew impatient waiting for the event to begin and stepped off the curb ahead of schedule. When they found out what had happened, King and other march ''leaders'' had to scramble to catch up. Freedom was in the air and the marchers saw no need to wait for permission to move. Forty-one years later, that vignette from another era offers an irresistible analogy to frame what has been happening these past few days in San Francisco. Public opinion seesaws between tolerance and intolerance, courts and legislatures debate civil union and marriage and abruptly, thousands of gay and lesbian couples decide to stop waiting for other people's decisions. San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom makes the quixotic decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and suddenly gay men and lesbians are rushing as fast as planes, trains and Nikes will carry them, to the city where Tony Bennett left his heart. Critics say the mayor has acted in defiance of state law, but Newsom calls same-sex marriage ``inevitable.'' LEGAL DEBATE In the long term, he might well be right. In the short term, it's a dicier question. The issue is being fought in the courts even as we speak and nobody can say with authority how it will come out. Gay marriage may move forward to legality, may move backward to prohibition; it remains to be seen. The one thing that seems beyond debate is that the issue is indeed moving. And there is, I think, something uplifting in the manner of that movement. Meaning that it comes not at the behest of some charismatic national leader or the bidding of some strident national organization. People are moving, rather, two by two, moving upon decisions made at dinner tables and in front of televisions, moving upon a conviction that now is the time. Drops of water melting into a flood. The flood hurling itself against a wall, intolerance. INTOLERANCE When you get past selective application of biblical injunctions and pious invocations of moral concern, that intolerance usually boils down to this curious bit of reasoning: Discrimination against gays ought to be allowed because, unlike skin color and culture, homosexuality is something people ''choose'' and therefore, can un-choose. So, critics say, society ought not be required to extend civil rights protections to gay people. Rather, gay people ought to be required to change. The most absurd of the many absurd things about that argument is this: It asks us to believe a man might have his choice of a sexuality that is accepted and celebrated and one that will leave him open to ridicule, estrangement, physical abuse, job and housing discrimination, and the loss of basic legal protections ... and he would take the second one. If that's not the dumbest thing I've ever heard, it's definitely in the top 10. CAUSES Granted, science has yet to figure out what causes homosexuality. Its roots may be psychological, may be physiological or may be, as I suspect, a combination of both. But ultimately, it doesn't really matter, does it? Whatever causes a man to be gay or a woman lesbian is obviously powerful enough that they have no real choice in the matter. The people who have been flocking to Mayor Newsom's city did not decide to be gay. Anyone who is watching them with that thought in mind is missing -- probably on purpose -- the point. What they have decided is that they are human beings worthy of human dignity. What they have decided is that they are tired of waiting for people to get that. What they have decided is that it's time to step off the curb.

      I never considered how amusing the American Family Association might be. In my attempt to follow up and verify a news article I ran across, I started searching their website and was surprised at how funny the whole site was. The claims made on the website are more outrageous than the supermarket tabloids they are, apparently, crusading against. And here I thought they were devoting all their time to stopping gay marriage. I'm glad to know the National Enquirer is taking some of the heat too.  The following is an unaltered headline from one of their  urlLink pages :  Supermarkets educate children in a "trail of sex." Kids corralled like cattle and force fed doses of porn   Who knew?  I obviously need to change grocery stores, because mine certainly doesn't have any "trails of sex." Although quite frankly, given the looks of most cashiers, I can't say I'm too disappointed, but there is the occasionally cute bag boy.  In this same article the AFA claims that: "Once inside the "chute," our children are bombarded by the company's complete lack of respect for traditional family values. It is here grocery managers, like cattle wrangling cowboys, start branding the minds of parents and children alike with images and descriptions of casual, social, and noncommittal sex from magazines like Cosmopolitan, Glamour, and Redbook."   5 minutes ago : Saddam       Out : Kim Jong-il          In : grocery managers  My sister reads  Glamour . Maybe she's a communist. Hmmm.   Slightly more outrageous than this claim and the spelling errors that pepper the "news items", is this  urlLink statement :  "A Christian attorney says homosexual groups are teaching student activists in public schools to use provocative behavior to goad other students into acting hostilely toward them."  ""Their goal is to transform American public schools into centers of pro-gay activity and training," he says. "They want the schools to advance the gay agenda through 'sensitivity training,' 'diversity' days, [and by] including homosexuality in curricula, etcetera."  "Lively says student activists who flaunt their homosexual behavior in front of students considered to be "rednecks or jocks" often succeed in forcing their school to adopt an anti-bullying policy that embraces a pro-homosexual perspective, because if the school does not take action they are likely to be sued"  Remember, kids, homosexuals like to be beat up. So don't do it; they'll only get off on it. The pervs.  What is flaunting anyway? Is that like patting a "jock" on the butt during a workout? Nah, nothing gay about that.  This entire evening of entertainment was brought to me looking for the AFA's poll on gay marriage.  Although I couldn't fin that poll, I did find a poll asking if visitors would be willing to boycott MTV. I guess Jesus says to make sure you can win a boycott before you begin one.  Was that in the book of Numbers? By the way, you don't get to vote "no," you just get to tell them you would support one.  Just to be sure you want to support the boycott, they link you to "very offensive" dialogue.   The dialogue is about whether one of the Real World cast members has a large, um, member not in a cast.  Unfortunately, the article just leaves you hanging about how low the guy hangs.  I had to read through it twice just to make sure I was sufficently offended.  Whatever happened to just turning off the television or monitoring your children?  I still didn't find the poll I was looking for. According to the February 14  Q-Notes , a Charlotte based gay newspaper:     The American Family Association, originally said on its web site that it intended to report to Congress the results of its internet poll on gay marriage. But now it is porbably not going to follow through...after nearly 60 percent of the more than 825,000 votes tallied expressed support of gay marriage. "Homosexual activist groups went ot the trouble of skewing this particular poll," said Gary Glenn directore of the AFA of Michigan.  "Perhaps it is some comfort to them." The organization considred pulling the poll off its webs site but decided instead to leave it as a wake up call to "traditional American families (who) do not realize the seriousness of this threat." said Buddy Smith, executive assistant to the chairman of the AFA. "We were surprised they hijacked the poll," said Smith.   The warning must have expired because I couldn't find a trace of it on the website.  One imagines that had 825,000 votes been hijaked by religious fundamentalist in support of the amendment, they would have still shown the poll to Congress. Perhaps the outcome of this poll is why you can only vote "yes" in the MTV boycott poll.  Perhaps the outcome of this poll is because most Americans are not as crazy and paranoid as these people seem to be.

      DontAmend.com, a website established to fight the amendment of the United States Constitution in regards to gay marriage, has set up a sister site, DearMary.com.  This website seeks to call Mary Cheney, out lesbian daughter of Vice President Dick Cheney, to activist service in the ranks of amendment opposers.  A similar website and movement was very successful a few years ago with StopDrLaura.com, which managed to finally help in the removal of the notorious Dr. Laura's television show.    Mary Cheney has been under heavy fire recently from many gay activists. Gay journalist Michelangelo Signorile recently wrote a scathing article calling Mary on her invisibility and inactivity at this turbulent time for gay rights.  He's not the only one questioning her absence, and now this website has emerged, promoted with a rather humorous graphic of Mary's face on a milk carton. Perhaps the most shocking part of this whole affair, however is, as one friend commented, Mary's tragic hair.  I am no apologist for Mary Cheney. I believe she could be doing a world of good by publicly supporting gay marriage and opposing amendments to any constitution, federal or state. Mary could make a decided impact in this whole issue. By remaining quiet on this issue, choosing instead to quietly run her father's campaign, she chips away at her own soul and smashes her self-dignity.    Despite my belief that Mary should be on the front lines with other gay activists, I am ashamed of these tactics and villifying columns. We need to act better than the opposition, and quite frankly, we are have sunk past the gutter to Karl Rove levels. Now, that should scare you.  In his article Signorile writes: "So let’s get to the point: What the hell happened to you? Are you just another spoiled rich brat—the lesbian Paris Hilton—worried about getting a chunk of those 30 million Halliburton bucks should Dad’s heart conk out?"  While I understand Signorile's frustration (I feel it too), this is nothing more than an  ad hominem  attack.  We can call Mary to action without resorting to being children in a school-yard.  And while Mary's hair on the milk carton is tacky, it is no moreso than the carton itself.  The campaign could have been launched without being so abrasive.  Perhaps more disturbing to me than Mary's absence is all this energy being directed towards bringing her forward. The Dearmary website is asking for donations in order to print full page ads in the New York Times and Washington Post.  These ads cost around $55,000.  Why gather this amount of resources to attract the attention of somebody who undoubtably could be a dynamic spokesperson, but who has no real governmental authority. Ultimately, Mary Cheney holds no office and wields no power to make change.  An implied understanding seems to be that Mary has not discussed these issues with her father. We simply don't know and ultimately it doesn't matter. The Vice President just a few years ago stated his position that the federal government should not be involved in this issue, which he has now retracted by supporting the President's threats to back a constitutional amendment.  Clearly, Dick Cheney held (and I believe still holds) a belief that would give his daughter some rights, but has compromised himself and his love for his daughter by advocating the President's discriminatory stance.  I doubt a public statement from Mary would impact the Vice President's stance the slightest.  Out politicians (Barney Frank) and relatives of politicians (Candace Gingrich) have been outspoken on issues of our community.  And we see the impact those with power and those close to power have made. Not a criticism of these individuals, they can only do so much without a wider base of support.  We would be better focusing our attention on winning the support of individuals with real power who would support us. We should be focusing on the American public and demonstrating that Rome did not fall because of too many bridal registrations at Pottery Barn.  Supposedly Mary Cheney helped convince some of the gay public to vote for her dad and George W. during the 2000 election with promises of moderation and compassion towards our community from these seemingly hard-line conservatives. And, so apparently, this vitriolic response is anger re-directed at Mary from that false hope.  The only people these activists should be angry at are themselves for believing that promise in the first place.

      Moms hold a special place in most boy's hearts.  I think this is often especially true for gay men and boys, who are often characterized or stereotyped as "Mama boys."  And I, for one, am proud to be labelled as such.  In the realm of Mom-dom, my mother is probably as close to perfect as Moms can get.  My sentimentality was triggered this week when I recalled the story of a young gay man whose parents had taken him out of a college environment he was thriving in, sent him somewhere to be "repaired" and then forbade him to contact his friends at the college, straight and gay alike, because they "made him" gay or at least encouraged it.  I was also recently thinking about the writings of Christopher Priest who has written several essays on the expectation his ex-wife's family put on him, as well as his own family, during holiday periods.  My mom has always been the great peacemaker in the family, between myself and others, as well as with other members of the family.  When I have been in serious relationships, my mother has never put expectations on me for being home at any specific time.  She has never pressured me to spend more time with my family than with other families involved in my life or how I should be doing that.  She has never asked me to stop being gay or told me it was wrong or said any one bad thing about it.  She has welcomed my boyfriend into her house as she would anyone else. And she has helped his assimilation into the overall family, working some kind of wonderous magic towards that end.  Peter's mom is a wonderful woman as well. She's a great source of support for him, a delightful and funny human being, full of energy and enthusiasm. She has welcomed me warmly, generously and openly. She even likes Godzilla movies. (My own mom loves old horror movies and it was her love of these films that sparked my own love for classic, and some more modern, horror and suspense movies.)    Some of my fondest childhood memories are sitting in the kitchen of my grandmother's house after Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner listening to my mom, grandmother, and aunts talk while the men went into the living room to watch football and the younger kids went off to play.  I miss those times, especially now, since as an adult member of the family I could contribute to the conversation. But then I just listened and watched.   All of this said, in effect, to present the following excerpt from the New York Times (February 15, 2004).  The article chronicles the search to replace Harvey Firestein as "Edna," the mother from the current Broadway hit "Hairspray" (based on John Water's classic trash classic).  Michael McKean who many may remember as "Lenny" from "Laverne and Shirley" or later a cast member of Saturday Night Live, or possibly from several hysterical movie roles (This Is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind) was chosen.    I have no idea about McKean's sexuality nor any interest in it, in the article, McKean comments on how playing this role in drag relates to the recent death of his mother.  His thoughts touched me quite a bit as I reflected on my own mother and how, possibly, being gay has allowed me a special perspective and closeness to my mother that I might not have otherwise enjoyed.   The real challenge for Mr. McKean will be to give the jokes their full due by finding the womanliness in his maleness. It's a job that seems timely to him. "I keep thinking about that lovely quote from Wilde," he said. " `All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.' So this gig is for my mom. She would have loved it."

      Having lived in Tupelo, MS, I feel personally responsible for letting this whole gay-marriage debate out of hand. I should've done the honorable thing and taken Donald Wildmon out with a katanna years ago. I apologize.   Last spring, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss., decided to hold a summit meeting of the Christian conservative movement.  Mr. Wildmon felt the movement was losing the culture war, he recalled in an interview on Friday. Since plunging into political activism nearly 30 years ago, Christian conservatives had helped Republicans take control of Washington but did not have enough to show for it, Mr. Wildmon said. At the same time, the election of Republican politicians had drained some of the motivation out of its grass-roots constituents.   So Mr. Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association and a crusader against sex and violence in the media, sent an e-mail message inviting about two dozen other prominent Christian conservatives to a meeting in Arlington, Va., last June. About 14 people turned up with no set agenda, Mr. Wildmon recalled.   "All we knew was we were going to get together and see if there were some issues of concern that we could agree on and combine our efforts," Mr. Wildmon said.   "The first thing that popped up," he said, "was the federal marriage amendment."   So, because another religious leader is losing his power base (although not in the scandalous way that so many of them tend to do ala Jim Bakker or Jimmy "Great Balls o Fire" Swaggart), gay marriage becomes a moving target. I'm reminded of the old Looney Tunes cartoon where Bugs and Daffy argue whether it's duck or rabbit season. The Rev. Wildmon plays the befuddled Elmer, not really caring who he shoots so long as he gets to shoot someone. In his own Fuddian epic, the Rev. Wildmon hunts for his raison detre and suddenly its penguin season.  Don is going after gay marriages. And, well, apparently, to paraphrase Annie Lennox, "penguins are doin' it for themselves."    There have been many famous gay marriages down the ages: Chip and Dale, Chip & Reichen from THE AMAZING RACE, Segfreid and Roy, and now,  Roy and Silo    [These] two chinstrap penguins at the Central Park Zoo in Manhattan, are completely devoted to each other. For nearly six years now, they have been inseparable. They exhibit what in penguin parlance is called "ecstatic behavior": that is, they entwine their necks, they vocalize to each other, they have sex. Silo and Roy are, to anthropomorphize a bit, gay penguins. When offered female companionship, they have adamantly refused it. And the females aren't interested in them, either.  At one time, the two seemed so desperate to incubate an egg together that they put a rock in their nest and sat on it, keeping it warm in the folds of their abdomens, said their chief keeper, Rob Gramzay. Finally, he gave them a fertile egg that needed care to hatch. Things went perfectly. Roy and Silo sat on it for the typical 34 days until a chick, Tango, was born. For the next two and a half months they raised Tango, keeping her warm and feeding her food from their beaks until she could go out into the world on her own. Mr. Gramzay is full of praise for them.  "They did a great job," he said.   And apparently these guys have received their copy of the homosexual agenda because they have recruited.    Roy and Silo are hardly unusual. Milou and Squawk, two young males, are also beginning to exhibit courtship behavior, hanging out with each other, billing and bowing. Before them, the Central Park Zoo had Georgey and Mickey, two female Gentoo penguins who tried to incubate eggs together. And Wendell and Cass, a devoted male African penguin pair, live at the New York Aquarium in Coney Island.   Maybe it's just something in the water in New York.  Not surprising with all the musicals running around willy-nilly up there, especially with Rosie and Boy George leading the charge (well, I guess not any more).   Fag hags even exist in the animal kingdom apparently:   [S]tudies showed that adult male dolphins formed long-term alliances, sometimes in large groups. As adults, they cooperate to entice a single female and keep other males from her. Sometimes they share the female, or they may cooperate to help one male.    We all have one, don't we? And sometimes we have to share her with our friends. After all, you may be the style-guru, but it's really Paul who know just how to apply that mascara.  The article does prudently state that animal behavior shouldn't necessarily be a barometer for what is or isn't genetic in humans or for constructing social or ethical policy. As the New York Times point out, lots of animals kill the young of other animals (and sometimes their own).  Just because it happens in nature doesn't mean we're going to legalize the mowing down of toddlers even when they chatter on in a movie theater. Perhaps we can do something about the parents,however.  Still, with this kind of behavior in the animal kingdom, it becomes a stretch to say that homosexuality is caused by some type of mental perversion or social ill. With these specific examples, it seems hard to argue that homosexuals do anything to destroy family structures. Rather, they nuture it:    Marlene Zuk, a professor of biology at the University of California at Riverside...notes that...homosexuality may have an evolutionary purpose, ensuring the survival of the species. By not producing their own offspring, homosexuals may help support or nurture their relatives' young. "That is a contribution to the gene pool," she said.   And you always thought that your Uncle Bill (three dollar Bill as your dad used to call him) was only good for being the only fun relative you had.    So, wow, look at the complete and utter destruction gay penguins are causing the fabric of penguin society. About as much as loving gay couples cause to human society.  The religious right constantly harp that gay marriage will destroy the traditional family, but never quite elaborate on how that will be accomplished. Quite frankly, we'll be too busy planning our far-more-fabulous-than-our-neighbor's house-warming/Christmas/cookout/Fourth of July party that everyone on the block must attend.    I've always thought that the leaders of the religious right were merely power-hungry. They can't stand giving up the power they have over their constituents, so they make up threats to keep them coming back for more. In the past it was slavery, then Communism, then often fighting black civil rights. Now the coffers are getting low and the sheep are shrugging their shoulders, so the next beast of the apocolypse must rear its ugly head.    Duck, Don and Silo, it's penguin season!

      I have a friend whose brother has been serving in the military in Iraq during the invasion.  Within days he should thankfully be back in the United States.  His girlfriend, to whom he plans to marry, but is not yet, is recognized by the US military as the family member to whom information regarding his status, including his expected date of return, should be communicated. This important information regarding his welfare and location in the world is sent not to his parents, or to any of his siblings, but rather to this woman to whom he is not even yet engaged to at this time.    While I'm exceptionally happy for my friend, her brother, and their family, nothing at the same time makes me angrier.  First, a person seving in the military who has a same-sex partner would not even be allowed to divulge that information without being drummed out immediately.  It wouldn't matter how faithfully and well they served. It wouldn't matter that he/she spent months on hostile foreign soil in service to the whims of dishonest politicians. If a serviceperson asked that their return home be communicated to their same-sex partner, they would be forcibly removed from the military.  But let's forget the insipid "don't ask, don't tell" policy for this rant.  Rather, do you think for one minute that, even if military personnel were allowed to be out and serve that the US government would recognize their partner as having family status and communicate with them? Of course not. The government would insist that the solider list a blood relative.  The courtesy they afford a potential heterosexual partner would not even be considered towards a homosexual partner, regardless if they had spent the past twenty years together.  Again, our commitment and dedication to our loved ones, and our service to our country (both military and financial) are ignored, devalued, and derided.  This is but one more reason we need gay marriage. This is one more reason why we need to challenge American cultural values about homosexuality. This is one more reason we need to preach back to those in the pulpits.  One more reason why America needs to provide the same rights and protections afforded its straight citizens to its gay ones as well.

      "It doesn't matter who's to blame. They are all a bunch of terrorists. One does it for God, the other because they think they have a purer blood line."  So, can you guess who said this and who it was said about?  According to the New York Times, Jesus Miguel Gomez said it in regard to the train attacks in Madrid.  I would be a travesty to compare the Basque terrorists or Al Queda to most of the population of the American Religious Right.  Although a few extremists commit horrible acts such as bombing abortion clinics, terrorizing abortion doctors, or protesting that "God hates fags" at funerals, these individuals are just that, extremists and atypical.  My first reaction to reading that line, however, was wondering if it was said in either relation to the Religious Right or possibly even the Bush administration.  Either is overblown, but I think my reaction speaks to the current atmosphere in America.  Fundamentalist Christians and Republicans in power have made me feel so uncomfortable in my own country that I am not surprised that some individuals, angered at the resistance gays face currently in America, did not make such a comparison.  The Bush/Republican opposition to gay marriage is hardly based on either on any belief of faith or idea of sanctity and purity, despite the rhetoric the President spews like so much vomitous garbage.  The President's support of a Constitutional Amendment is solely a political convenience to secure the blessings of Christian Fundamentalists.  At one point in my life I would have self-identified as a Christian Fundamentalist; today I see myself as a Liberal Christian.  Some of my friends and family are still Fundamentalists. They are good, decent people who have beliefs rooted in love, compassion, and beneficence.  Still, I wonder if the concept of  Fundamentalist  itself is not inherently troublesome.  Theoretically a fundamental belief  or understanding means an understanding on the most basic level. Rather than simpleness, the word actually conveys an understanding that is so complex and deep, that the person has mastered the understanding of the underlying principles of the complex system or theory.  Fundamental Christianity, however, is just the opposite. Today it means a simplified view of the Christian faith.   The central tenet does seem simple: Christ was fully man and fully God born of virgin birth and raised from the dead as an atonement for the sins of all people. However, most Fundamental Christians have added to this core principle a thoroughly non-Scriptural teaching: the Bible must be seen as inerrent and read without any historical-critical context.  Although the first tenet is not without problems (for one, it does not take into account the discrepancies in the Gospels concerning the life and teaching of Christ), but this new piece of dogma is the most problematic.  The idea that the Bible can be and must be read through an archaic (though beautiful) translation with a modern contextual understanding defies any logic, yet is how the Bible is mostly read by Fundamentalist.  No discussion is held in Fundamentalist churches about what Paul means when he uses the word "natural." There is no concept that what Paul thought was "natural" in his time and context might be different from how we use the word, the modern connotations of the word or how we define it.  Of course depending on the denomination or church, you will still have sections ignored that cannot be reconciled with a strictly modern context. The Bible stricly forbids women from speaking in church, advocates celibacy over marriage, and condones slavery, just to start.  Yet in most congregations, these problems are not addressed.  Still, most Fundamentalists want to jump on the "homosexuality is a sin" bandwagon because "the Bible says so."  I suppose this phenomenon occurs because most Fundamentalist know women, many are women, actually, and women have actually probably been responsible for helping maintain modern Christian faith more than men. Most Fundamentalist enjoy the opposite sex and having sex, so they marry. And many Fundamentalist know and are black, so slavery is not a good idea. However, gays make up such a small percentage of the population (3%-10%) that, even if a Fundamentalist knows a few, the critical mass is not there to make them change their mind.  And while even most rational whites can relate to the idea that your skin color should not make you bad (what is the roles were reversed?), same-sex attraction is completely foreign and unthinkable. Thus, it's an easy target.  And, much like a bully in a schoolyard, Fundamentalism has caused emotional and spiritual terror to many gays.  Fundamentalism has caused many of us to believe for so long that there is something wrong with us; we'd better change or we'll burn; and that we are Satanic deviants.  We've been ostracized instead of loved and embraced.  We've had parents and friends try to change our wicked ways. Fundamentalism has left deep psychic scars on much of gay-dom in the name of God.  And notoday, the terrorism expands to a legal assault.  Not content with the emotional sub-human status, they have labelled us with, many Fundamentalists want to instill into law our second-class position.  Although they haven't bombed or shot at us, who knows how many gay people have taken their own lives or continue to live as broken people because of this message.  Nobody thinks well when we talk of Islamic Fundamentalist. It's seen as a bad thing.  Christian Fundamentalist need to ask themselves what makes them different.

       "While [Will and Jack] are as stereotypical as Amos and Andy, they help humanize gay life."    --Gay author Felice Picano to Richard Burnett's Three Dollar Bill column in Montreal's Hour newspaper    "We're not actors, we're just guys on a TV show being ourselves. We don't claim to represent  the entire gay community. ... If that means that in some way we sometimes embody these stereotypes then so be it, because if it's not OK to sometimes be stereotypical -- whatever that means -- then it's allowing a fearful straight community to dictate to me how I should behave."    --Queer Eye for the Straight Guy's Kyan Douglas to Miami's The Weekly News, Dec. 18.   Much ado has been made over the stereotypes represented on Bravo's Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. I find it to be much ado about nothing.  With the exception of Carson Kreely, the fashion maven, I don't see these guys as being very stereotypical.  And while I think that while Carson may camp it up from time to time, overall I don't think he's playing a character. (Consequently, Carson, much like Jack on Will & Grace is one of the best elements on the show, adding a great touch of humor and particular queerness.)  Are the other members of the Fab 5 supposed to be stereotypes because they are experts on grooming, food, culture, and home decor?  That's something akin to saying that women hosting makeover shows are being stereotypical because women are supposed to be good with makeup.   First, stereotypes generally exist because somewhere, somehow they are built upon at least a grain of truth.  I have witnessed some of the harshest stereotypes played out in people, sometimes several people, I know and respect.  The primary problem is that stereotypes are usually employed by hateful and ignorant people to oppress entire groups.  These people seek to solidfy their power base by instilling the stereotype as The Truth and then spread this disinformation.  But stereotypes can be fun when rooted in truth.  I love, and I mean love, a good show tune.  And if you catch me on the right day, my inner drag queen will emerge and I'll do a full a dead-on Diana Ross singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."  I don't care that anyone knows it, although any who hear it may rue the day.    Unfortunately, the idea of the effeminate gay man is an object of scorn even among many in the gay community.  Look at any personal ad these days and you're more likely than not to see somebody seeking "straight-acting" or "masculine" men.  Some of the cruder ads specifically ask for "no femmes."  The only place it seems you'll find an effeminate man accepted seems to be on  Queer as Folk , with Emmet, the loveable flamer of the group.  Certainly when it debuted,  Queer as Folk  was held up as not only giving us stereotypes of the community, but dwelling on the most negative of stereotypes: promiscuous and orgiastic sex and prolific drug use.  And, for the most part, those critics were right.  Strangely, this criticism is rarely heard any more, perhaps because the show is in its fourth season now and is old news or newer, fresher targets like  Queer Eye  are available.  Perhaps those criticisms have died down because QAF was recognized as the soap opera it truly is (and what soap opera doesn't have the most extreme personalities of people represented). Probably all of these factors contributed, but perhaps also the realization that, despite all its sensationalism, QAF actually taught some very positive things to the straight world.    Straight people began to hold get togethers around the show. Supposedly it is a huge hit with straight women particularly.  The show also embraced feminine men like Emmet; inter-generational love; acceptance of HIV positive men; and accepting people despite their faults. The show also showed the struggles of gay life.  It showed the strains of gay parenting, making relationships work, legal issues, workplace issues, and more.   Complaints have been levied against Will Truman for his uber-celebate life as well as the uber-flaming Jack on  Will & Grace.   Critics target the character of Will as having no love life and, thus, being the ultimate non-threatening gay man. No wonder heterosexuals accept him, and by extension the show, they say, because Will doesn't exhibit any behavior (say, like kissing other men) that tends to scare the straights.  Also, could we have anyone more stereotypical than Jack. He's irresponsible, flighty, fashion-obsessed, catty, and incapable of sustaining a stable or single relationship. Oh, and he loves showtunes.    While these criticisms aren't foundless, what ground have we lost with this show?  Will & Grace  arguably made bringing shows like  Queer Eye  and perhaps even  QAF  to our television screens. This show laid a foundation that resonates today.   Ellen  could be mentioned here as truly setting us up for Will & Grace, but, unfortunately, it blew it.  Although the infamous "Puppy Episode" was handled well,  Ellen  subsequently shifted focus dramatically. What little humor there previously was drowned in DeGeneres working through her own issues on television.  It lost ratings once  Ellen  came out, and turned off viewers while  Will & Grace  sustains an audience after firmly establishing in the first episode that Will would never be converted to heterosexuality. (Consequently, Will's life has not been as neutered as some would make out. In one episode, his fantasy of sleeping with Stone Phillips was hysterically depicted with a guest appearance by Phillips himself.)  Ultimately, all of these shows do contain stereotypical behaviior from their cast to one degree or another. Still, none of them are the glitter-paint minstrel shows some critics would make them out to be.  Being queer once meant being something radical.  Queer politics was not about conforming to the mainstream, but standing apart from it and still demanding acceptance. Now being gay has somehow evolved into being as similar to straight America as we possibly can be.  The political line has become, "if we're more ordinary, they won't notice we like people with the same genitalia."  So, now, in true Donner family fashion, we are turning on these shows and our own sensibilities because they fail to hide  queerness .  They are criticized because these gay people are too, well, gay.  (Or in Will's case, he isn't gay enough, although Jack is too gay.)  Somehow we've become afraid that if we promote the idea we all like high coutre (the label I like best says "wash and wear"), or we have fabulous house decors (mine is chez Garden Ridge) that we'll quit finding acceptance among straight people.  Now isn't that a queer idea?

      Anti-Gay Group Accused Of Cheating Own Lawyers  by 365Gay.com Newscenter Staff    Posted: April 6, 2004 12:01 pm. ET   (Virginia Beach, Virginia) A law firm has asked a Virginia judge to seize the assets of the Christian Coalition to collect more than $75,000 in unpaid legal costs.  The firm of Huff, Poole and Mahoney says the coalition, one of the most vocal anti-gay organizations in the county, is seeking a garnishee of assets to pay bills that it says it is owed.   David M. Zobel, an attorney with the Virginia Beach firm, said the fees were from “a combination of several accounts owed on several files.” Zobel would not say if any of the unpaid work was dealing with gay issues.   The coalition has had an association with Huff, Poole and Mahoney since the conservative Christian organization was formed by Virginia Beach broadcaster Pat Robertson in 1989.   “It is unfortunate that it has come to this,” Drew McKissick , spokesperson for the Christian Coalition of America told the Virginian-Pilot newspaper.    “Our accountants have been working with the firm to work this out, and hopefully it will be worked out soon.”  The coalition reached the peak of its influence in 1994, when it was credited with playing a key role in the Newt Gingrich-led Republican Party’s takeover of Congress.   But three years later, its executive director, Ralph Reed, resigned.  Currently he is a political consultant on the Campaign To Re-elect The President.  McKissick acknowledges the organization has had money problems. But he said things are looking up.   Since the gay marriage issue has been catapulted to national attention, McKissick said, more money has been coming in.   He said that the coalition is now emphasizing “voter identification, voter registration and voter education” in an all-out effort to support candidates that support a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.    ©365Gay.com® 2004

      "All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to violate would be oppression.  Let us, then fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind."  "And let us reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions."  Thomas Jefferson uttered these words during his first Presidential Inauguration on March 4, 1801.  They are words the current President and many conservatives would do well to pay attention to.  We seem to have strayed from these ideals: that minorities must possess equal rights and that the will of the majority is not always just or correct.  In my opinion the so-called activist judges have done exactly what Mr. Jefferson said they must, making sure that the law protects a minority and to end oppression.   Popular opinion was against the legalization of interracial marriage even when the Supreme Court overruled any law that prohibited it in the 1960's.  Popular opinion has been against same-sex marriage. It doesn't mean that the majority is right.  Just because the majority isn't in favor of it, doesn't mean that right (and the Supreme Court defined marriage as a right in that landmark case) should be taken from a group.  To put it in the words of William Lowndes Yancey, a Congressman of both the US Congress and Confederate Senate, " Constitutions are made solely for the protection of the minorities in government, and for the guidance of majorities."   President Jefferson also alludes to slipping the snare of religious prosecution and intolerance.  Fundamentalist want to insist that this is a Christian nation built upon Judeo-Christian ethics.  This piece of creative rewriting of history ignores the fact that while many of our founding fathers believed in God or a god, several of them (Jefferson included) were Deist, who believed that God set the wheels in motion and left the system to run on its own.  This nation was set up in part to escape state-imposed religion,  yet this is exactly what the Religious Right seeks to establish.  Fundamentalists will not be satisfied until the United States is a theocratic democracy: you get to participate if you're a right-wing Christian. Christians who disagree are heretics and may not participate.  The Religious Right has already done a great job of sinking its hooks into the Republican party.  Christians need to wake up and realize that the Religious Right is a political movement about the establishment of power for certain individuals, not about the protection of some idealized Christian nation or even the protection of Christian rights and beliefs.  The Religious Right seeks to become that "despotic, wicked" persecuting power not seen since the American Revolution or perhaps the Inquisition.  Hope does exist, however.  A recent  urlLink LA Times  study shows an increased support for gay marriage, although not an overwhelming or even a majority numer.  Slightly over half the respondants favored at least civil unions.  Other values and ideas about gays also tend to be improving. A vast majority support keeping gays in the military (70%) and many feel that gays should have civil right protections similar to other minorities (62%).  So, the picture is looking up, although the struggle is not over.  Although some may object to my discounting the majority when it disagrees with me, but fully embracing it when its opinion is favorable, certainly that does not inherently make the majority right,  but it does make this minority happy.

      According to  urlLink 365gay.com ,  Providencetown is set to issue marriage licenses to out-of-towners without checking up on if their state forbids same-sex marriage.  You may already be aware that a law passed in 1913 that forbids non-Massachusetts residents from getting married in Massachusetts if their home state does not legally allow it.  The law was originally passed to restrict interracial marriage and hasn't been enforced in years.  Many have been concerned that this law will be enforced come May 17 to restrict gays in DOMA states from coming to Massachusetts.  In a very surprising turn of events, officials in Providencetown said they will not check up on applicants if applicants claim that their state permits same-sex marriage.  Other municipalities in the state may or may not follow this example.  I'm exceptionally happy about this news and hope it continues to stand.  I have been skeptical of gay marriage becoming a reality so soon, but signs are now very positive.  I thought that Mitt Romney might actually prevail in derailing the ceremonies, but he is almost out of options.  Although Romney is currently trying to get a special appointee to plead to the court to delay their ruling, so he could still prevail. Hopefully it will be a long-shot, however, as this attempt is very unusual and exceptionally desperate.  I have to agree with  urlLink Rex Wockner  who questions why Romney is so fervently anti-gay.  Doth the governor protest too much?

      A friend sent this to me and I thought it was hilarious. We all certainly need some levity while we struggle with this important issue.    Same-Sex Wedding Etiquette    A couple of things you should know before the same-sex wedding.....    1) On the day of a gay wedding, it's bad luck for the two grooms to see each other at the gym.   2) Superstition suggests that for good luck the couple should have: Something bold, something fierce, Something trashy, something dirty.   3) It's customary at gay and lesbian nuptials for the parents to have an open bar during the ceremony.   4) Gay wedding tradition dictates that both grooms refrain from eating wedding cake because it's all carbs.   5) It's considered bad luck for either of the grooms to have dated the priest.   6) During the first dance, it's considered unlucky to use glow sticks, flags, whistles or handheld lasers.   7) For good luck at the union of a drag queen, the bouquet is always thrown in the face of a hated rival drag queen.   8) A local saying from colonial Northampton: A lesbian who owns a horse will never tell a lie, But a lesbian who votes Republican will leave you for a guy.   9) The wedding singer is not allowed to play/sing Let's hear it for the boy, YMCA or I will Survive.   10) The father of the Bottom pays for everything!

      I'm solidly convinced the way to get gay rights in America is to humanize ourselves.  That doesn't mean "mainstream" ourselves - we should be who we are whether that is flamboyant, conservative, campy, quiet, partiers, 9 to 5ers, urban dwellers, country folk.  I'm solidly against trying to Aberclone ourselves or fit into some preconceived notion of who we should be.  Although I've made the point before, it was saddening to hear at a recent talk on gay marriage a student in the audience ask, "What's wrong with our community? Why do we fight and label ourselves? We call people circuit boys or ask in our personal ads for no fats or fems."  We need to start accepting the diversity within our community if we are going to ask American society to accept us as a whole.  But I think the best way to fight any "isms" is to make ourself known, to let others we work and play with, let others in our families know that we are gay.  If people can put a face to what they hate, it's harder to hate.  Probably a gruesome analogy, in  Silence of the Lambs , the senator whose daughter is kidnapped starts repeating her daughter's name "Kathryn" on a television ad. Jodie Foster's character comments on how smart that is because it makes the victim a person and not just an object.  A similiar principle holds true here.  If people can see that we're not freaks, or at least no more freakier than they are, then they are less likely to view us as such.  Another example comes from when I was a graduate hall director. One night I had a white freshman guy screaming racial slurs constantly and loudly in the middle of the hallway.  One of the black residents on the floor, whom he knew, looked like he was on the verge of hitting the guy (and rightfully so).  I pulled the white guy into a room and pointed out, "how do you think your screaming that word makes your friend feel?"  His reply? "Well, he's different; he's not like the others."  Okay, maybe the guy didn't quite get the point. But, he was at least beginning to see that not all black people fit into his tiny world view.  His object of hate had a face that he couldn't hate or reject. As for extending his worldview, well it was nothing a good sledgehammer couldn't cure.  Being out also builds allies.  They can help put a human face on what seems to be a ponderously huge metaphysical and legal entanglement.  One of the smartest things I ever did was come out to my sister early on.  My sister has been a wonderful supporter of me.  She's never waivered in her devotion.  She has actively advocated for me and gay rights.  She is the inspiriation for this particular entry.  A photographer, she recently did a photo project on gay marriage for one of her college classes.  One particular student was being fairly aggressive and provocative and asked her, apparently spoiling for a good debate, "well, why did you choose gay marriage?"  My sister simply stated, "because my brother is gay and I think he should have the right to marry just like I do."  Her questioner immediately shut up with an "oh."  It's hard to argue with love.

      According to  Q-Notes , a North Carolina GLBT newspaper, a couple in Wilmington, NC are holding a children's book hostage because they are outraged that their daughter (age undisclosed) checked out  book called "King and King" from her elementary school library.  The children's book is the tale of a young prince whose mother demands he get married, and so he does, to another boy (and he doesn't settle for a "separate but equal" civil union).   Publishers Weekly  deems the book suitable for children age six and up.  But the conservative Christian couple disagrees and is refusing to return the book until the school promises to keep it out of circulation.  Although the county has a review process for books that concerned parents can utilize, Michael and Tonya Hartsell prefer to enforce their position on the entire community.  One suspects the Hartsells would not give back copies of  Catcher in the Rye  or  Huckleberry Finn  either.  One also wonders if they also favor banning the Bible from the same library, given its graphic depictions of violence and sexual situations.  Fortunately, the school principal is standing firm on the issue for not removing the book and demanding it's return.  According to  Q-Notes , Principal Elizabeth Miars stated, "What might be inappropriate for one family, in another family is a totally acceptable thing."  My full range of thanks and appreciation to Ms. Miars for taking this position, particularly in such a conservative state and during such a volatile time over gay rights.  (Others who wish to express their appreciation to Ms. Miars may email her at the school, Freeman Elementary at  freeman@nhcs.k12.nc.us. I know I plan to do so.)  The Hartsells say they are considering removing their daughter and putting her in a Christian Academy where views contrary to their own will not be expressed.  Has anyone else noticed this trend among the Religious Right? Homeschooling is very popular with Conservative Christians nowadays so they can protect their children from undesireable viewpoints and experiences. These couples want to "rear their child up in the ways of the Lord."  Politicially, the Religious Right tries to institute laws that enshrine their own views into mainstream American society.  Anybody who challenges laws they favor is instantly labelled as persecuting Christianity.  Although nothing new, book banning and censorship seems on the rise, particularly after all the hub-bub over Ms. Jackson's nub.  And family groups have labored for years to "clean up" television and movies to make them more suitable for children.  I wonder if this new strategy is a misunderstanding of Jesus' proclamation that "you do not belong to the world, but I have chose you out of the world." (John 15:19).  They must have missed the other parts about "going out into the world" (Mark 15:16).  I don't recall Jesus telling Christians to be isolationists.  It also seems to reveal a fundamental uncertainty about Fundamentalism if these people don't think their faith and tenets are strong enough to be tested.  Isn't it good to have the opportunity to teach a child why you believe a certain way or disagree with a certain viewpoint?  And, furthermore, what ever happened to the responsibility that parents have to monitor and control what their children see in various media?  Why have conservative Christians decided to abdicate their God-given mandate to watch over their child and hand that responsibility over to media watchdog groups and media networks?  Are Fundamentalists unaware of the censorship technology of, not the V-chip, but the "off" button?  But, I digress.  I'm both amused and disturbed at the hijacking of this book.  Parents have every right to chose what their child reads, but not a right to mandate what other children read.  Truly, it's a snapshot of the struggles going on currently in America in micro-scale.

      I'm distressed that the state of Georgia has passed through the legislature a state constitutional amendment against gay marriage. The amendment goes to the voters in November.  Georgia is already a DOMA state, so here is yet another case of trying to make gay marriage more illegal than it already is.  Advocates for these amendments say it's necessary because the DOMA laws may get struck down in court cases.  But isn't that what the court system is for? If the law should stand, then won't the courts uphold it?  I lived in Georgia for six great years. And while I realize Georgia is a Southern state, I'm very disappointed. I always felt that Georgia was one of the more progressive Southern states. Georgia holds the great city of Atlanta, which is heavily populated by gays and lesbians.  Atlanta is the Southern mecca for queers. Miami doesn't count because Florida is just a Northern state that got lost.  Still among the gay residents of Atlanta is my partner.  We're carrying on a long distance relationship since I have a job in North Carolina.  And although we're trying to arrange things so we are eventually in the same city at the same time, I also have family in Georgia that I visit often.  Georgia played some significant roles in the black civil rights movement, and Atlanta is the final resting place of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  I would have hoped that the lessons and struggles of that movement would have sensitized the citizens of this great state to issues of discrimination.  However, many in the black community support this amendment as well, due to the highly religious nature of Southern (and American) black culture.    Cynthia Tucker, a woman of color, and one of my favorite editors of the Atlanta Journal Constitution makes this same point in an article with WorkingForChange.com as she denounces black America's "knee jerk hostility towards gays."  You can read Ms. Tucker's article  urlLink here .  I will at some point write an article parallelling and actually differentiating gay and black civil rights struggles,  but I won't address that here.  I'm certainly not laying blame at the feet of black Georgians.  And despite Atlanta's fairly progressive attitudes and policies towards gays, there has been plenty of discrimination for years from various quarters.  Still, I never thought the Georgia legislature, seated in the center of Atlanta, would pass such a resolution.    It's painful to me to think that should my partner and I legally become husbands one day that while visiting Georgia, our rights and privledges could be stripped away. It's upsetting to think that if one of us were injured while travelling visiting my parents or just going back to Atlanta to play, we could be denied seeing each other. I can imagine worse than that even.    Even though I am in another state now, I will mobilize as much support as I can for people to vote against this hateful piece of legislation.  I pray that the gay community in Georgia will rise up against this measure and soundly defeat it along with our straight allies. Then, I hope they vote every politician that supported this amendment out of office.  Georgians, do what is right. Lead the way. In the 1960's, an NBC program said that Atlanta was an example to Southern cities in regards to civil rights. I hope that same sense of morality prevails in the 2000's.  Until these things are done, I'm afraid the state anthem rings truer than ever: "No peace I find / with that old sweet song / Georgia on my mind."

      I understand the complexities of equating gay civil rights with black civil rights.  There are some significant differences, yet also some significant parallels.  Many black community leaders have balked at equating the two. Some black leaders support it, many others do not. If I thought black leaders would unilaterally support gay rights, I would happily acequesce in the debate. Given this, it's nice to hear from this prominent figure in the black community.  From the  urlLink Miami Herald :  Posted on Wed, Mar. 24, 2004     MLK's Widow Supports Gay Marriage  Associated Press   POMONA, N.J. - The widow of Martin Luther King Jr. called gay marriage a civil rights issue, denouncing a proposed constitutional amendment that would ban it.  Constitutional amendments should be used to expand freedom, not restrict it, Coretta Scott King said Tuesday.  "Gay and lesbian people have families, and their families should have legal protection, whether by marriage or civil union," she said. "A constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages is a form of gay bashing and it would do nothing at all to protect traditional marriages."  Last month, President Bush said he backed an amendment that would ban same-sex unions, calling marriage "the most fundamental institution of civilization."  On Monday, more than two dozen black pastors rallied against gay marriage at a church in Atlanta, attempting to distance the civil rights struggle from the gay rights movement. They signed a declaration outlining their beliefs that marriage should remain a union between a man and a woman.  "To equate a lifestyle choice to racism demeans the work of the entire civil rights movement," the statement said. "People are free in our nation to pursue relationships as they choose. To redefine marriage, however, to suit the preference of those choosing alternative lifestyles is wrong."  King, the widow of the slain civil rights leader, made her comments Tuesday during a speech at The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey.

       I think this is progress...at the very least I like the judge's reasoning. So take that Tom Cruise...   Judge: Homosexual Isn't Libelous Term   MARTIN FINUCANE   Associated Press   BOSTON - Stating that someone is homosexual does not libel or slander them, particularly in light of new court decisions granting gays more rights, a federal judge has ruled.   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner came as she threw out a lawsuit by a former boyfriend of pop singer Madonna who claimed he was libeled because his name appeared in a photo caption in a book about Madonna - under a picture of Madonna walking with a gay man.   "In fact, a finding that such a statement is defamatory requires this court to legitimize the prejudice and bigotry that for too long have plagued the homosexual community," she wrote in her opinion Friday.   The attorney for plaintiff James Albright, who had worked for Madonna as a bodyguard, didn't immediately return telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment Saturday. Attorneys for the defendants, who included Madonna biographer Andrew Morton and St. Martin's Press, the publisher, also didn't respond to messages.   Gertner said other courts' rulings that stating someone is homosexual is defamatory had relied on laws criminalizing same-sex sexual acts that might well be unconstitutional. Previous decisions hadn't taken into account more recent decisions recognizing gays' equal rights, she said.   She pointed to a Supreme Court ruling last year that found a Texas sodomy law unconstitutional, and to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling last year that it would be unconstitutional to prevent gays in the state from marrying.

      Currently I'm listening to Enya's Orinoco Flow, which is really a fine, soothing piece of music.  Unfortunately it has been forever tainted by an incident where I was kidnapped by the drunk ex-girlfriend of my roommate. Too drunk to drive herself, one of her roommates drove her to our apartment where she, on the edge of an emotional breakdown, asked me come over and visit. She then locked me in her room, lit candles, and played an Enya CD that repeated in an endless loop.  She asked me to lay next to her (fully clothed) while she drifted off to sleep.  No way I could possibly sleep and was horrified at the possibility of her trying to make a move on me (this is not vanity speaking; she had, at a previous incident, acted incredulous when I refused to invite her inside my apartment after having dinner with her).  Luckily, she drifted off in a drunken stupor and I departed post haste.  See, now that's why I'm gay!

      You must understand that growing up in the South means you look at the Confederate flag on a regular basis. Maybe not every day or even every week, but the Confederate flag, or at least the representation of its bars and stars, is pervasive.  In the South, someone somewhere near you believes that the Confederate flag is a symbol of pride and heritage, and many, although certainly not all, of these people truly do not understand how anyone could see it as an image of exclusion, hatred, or oppression.  Thus, you must also understand that, to a certain extent, this pervasive exposure dulls the senses to the inherent symbolism of the flag somewhat. Although I firmly believe that if a large majority of the black population sees the flag as offensive, then we have a moral obligation to remove it from our governmental buildings or anywhere else it is associated with a formal representation of the American people, the sight of the Confederate flag does not inspire in me much of any kind of feeling.  So, I was taken by surprise somewhat as I was driving home tonight by an abundant display of Confederate flags that drew not just my attention, but some deeper reflection. On my way home I pass a major NASCAR speed track and this week is one of the larger races, the Coca Cola 500, I believe. NASCAR, despite its mainstreaming, for some reason manages to draw out copious numbers of Confederate flags, whether they be flown over an RV trailer or worn as a dew rag on the head.  For reasons that seem both obvious and confusing to me, NASCAR, despite popular acceptance (at least by white middle-class America), has held on firmly to its anti-establishment, redneck roots and character.  I sighed heavily; initially because of the impending wave of traffic that would impair my way home from work in the approaching days, but quickly my exasperation with the traffic- jam-to-be turned into an annoyance with seeing so many Confederate flags on display. Why must these people insist on putting the flag in peoples' faces, especially after so much debate in recent years over its symbolism and meaning.  And then it struck me: this is exactly the question we face as gay people every day. "Why do those queers have to flaunt their sexuality? Why do gays have to talk about being gay so often?" Many straight people, and even some gay people, do not understand why anyone would choose to fly a rainbow flag in front of a house or put a rainbow decal on the back of a car. I myself have been conservative in this area, but understand and respect those who choose to do so. After some consideration, I recently decided to put an HRC sticker on my car to show solidarity and support for gay rights issues in these turbulent political times.  Gay people can easily hide their sexual orientation. It's not like race or ethnicity which is typically very obvious (although skin color is much less telling than it used to and certainly an accent or dialect is no clear indicator either). Nobody ever has to know that a gay person is gay.  So why do we choose to "flaunt" it? Why wear that t-shirt that says "I'm not gay, but my boyfriend is"?    The answer is simple; we do it for the same reason some Southerners or NASCAR fans fly a Confederate flag. We do it for the same reason that you put a "My kid is an honor student" bumper sticker on your mini-van or that high school kid wears a shirt featuring his favorite band.  We do it for reasons not unlike the one someone puts a "Vietnam Veteran" license plate on their car. We're proud of who we are and you need to know it.  All human beings fight a constant paradox; we desire both to be unique individuals and to belong.  As such, we choose to identify ourselves with labels and indicators of our characteristics, personalities, and/or preferences that people might not otherwise know about us.  We identify ourselves in order to serve our warring needs.  Gay people also do it because you need to realize that we're sitting right next to you. We do it because you need to know we are your son, daughter, neighbor, brother, sister, mother, father, co-worker, boss, cashier, teacher, church pew sharer.  We do it because we're here, we're queer, and, by God, you're not used to it by now?  If you don't want us putting our gayness in your face, then don't put your Confederate flag, Mary Kay lapel pin, favorite sports team banner, Shriner order, or kid's perfect attendance in ours. Don't want us to talk about being gay? Stop talking about being heterosexual then; you know, how great your girl/boyfriend, husband/wife is, how little Johnny/Suzie did the cutest thing one year after he/she popped out from between yoru legs, or what a beautiful wedding your best friend just had despite the trouble with the caterer.    The thing is that we aren't asking you to stop talking about these things. And despite my internal monologue, I wouldn't suggest we ban individuals from displaying a Confederate flag. All we are asking is to be included in on the conversation; to be allowed to share every part of ourselves that we choose to share just as you do.  All we're really doing is, like the people who display a Confederate flag, letting you know what we like way down south.

      I just returned from Seattle, where I was attending an educational conference. During my stay I was able to explore a little of the downtown area. Last year I was in nearby Olympia, Washington and had very little time to see downtown Seattle, but I fell in love with it anyway. The people were friendly and relaxed and the weather happened to be beautiful and warm. (This year the weather ranged from chilly to warm, with sunshine and rain sharing time.) Although Seattle suffers somewhat from having the same chain-stores that every other major city has (Gap, Macys, etc.), you can easily escape the corporate businesses for a slice of Seattle life and local ownership. Starbucks are much more prolific than churches in the South; you can find one every few feet, even in the community neighborhoods, but they don't overwhelm it.  One of my favorite aspects of Seattle is that the gay population is evident.  Actually, a totally remarkable aspect of Seattle is, as a colleague put it, the crazy homeless black man walks right beside the professional upper-class white woman and she doesn't clutch her purse. Seattle is home to a true diversity of people and everybody seems quite ok with the arrangement.  The only required fashion statement seems to be a backpack.   But, as I said, the gay community is out and evident in every part of the city. Having lived in or near Atlanta for several years, I'm used to seeing gays heavily populating a city. Charlotte, NC, where I live now, has a small but proud gay population that isn't very evident. Gay sightings here tend to be limited to Targets, Garden Ridge, and grocery stores (surprise, surprise).  Even then, you need to be fmaily or have well developed 'dar to usually recognize these queers.  In Seattle, it's much different than even Atlanta. I saw more gay couples holding hands walking down the street, and not just in the "gay section" of downtown, than I did straight people. And nobody gave them funny stares; no heads turned, no whispering lips.  I obtained a  urlLink map  of "gay Seattle" from a Seattle gay bookstore,  urlLink  Beyond The Closet  , a nice little bookstore with some great deals. So, using the map, I set off in search of said bookstore, as well as another bookstore on the map. Mostly, I just wanted to see the  gaytto  .  My search took me up a steep hill on Pike street (a fairly fitting name for a street leading into the gay area of town) which brought me first to the Seattle  Eagle , a leather bar. I probably would have passed on by it without even noticing it has it not been for a large crowd gathered outside, and a police contingent.  Not wanting to pass through what I thought was a fight, I started to cross over the street until I saw another crowd. The crowd that stopped my crossing held signs that said "God hates fags" and "Thank God for 9/11" (I'm not sure what that had to do with God hating fags; I guess we died too in the Towers.)  Looked like the Fred Phelps gang was in town. I chose to stay on my side of the street and passed through, what I then realized were, the Eagle patrons angrily shouting back. Nobody was accomplishing anything, but it made for an interesting welcome committee.  I found Beyond the Closet and made a few purchases. I continued on into a lesbian sex toy shop ( Toys in Babeland ). I didn't stay long; I didn't want to be evicted by a lesbian, but who could resist a window display of dozens of dildos waving at you? I peeked in some other local vendors and made my way to a couple other bookstores. The sun came out and the day seemed about perfect as I walked amid locals eating or drinking outside by alternative shops and cafes that nobody else has ever heard of (no Starbucks here although still plenty of coffee shops).  My gay adventure didn't quite end there. On the plane trip home, a woman in her late 50's/early 60's easily sat beside me, her husband on the other side.  She sat without speaking a word. I was reading  Fast Food Nation  and wearing an Evergreen College t-shirt (which has a rather phallic looking clam on it, their mascot the Geoduck) so I don't know if my apparent liberalism discouraged her from speaking. Her husband sat on her other side. She wore numerous gold braclets on each arm and large gold earrings. She smelled faintly of that heavy sweet parfume smell older women smell like no matter what time of day it is.  She pulled out a workbook, "When Godly People do Ungodly Things: Arming Yourself in the Age of Seduction." A little checking on Amazon reveals this to be a book; this woman was clearly working on the companion reader's supplement.  "Week One"'s course of the study included "Background on Satan" and Day Three:"Sexual Orientation Bondage."  Oh boy.  The truly perverse side of me wanted to lean over and demand to see Chapter Three.  The question, "Oh, are you into bondage too? Guys in chaps are hot, huh?" wanted to slip past my lips. I demured instead, hoping that if she happened to strike up a conversation that I would find myself with an opportunity to articulate a reasonable and sensitive perspective this woman was undoubtably unfamiliar with.  She never said a word the whole time. In silent (or not so silent, I can't tell how loud my earbuds are to others) protest, I listened to the cast recording of  Naked Boys  singing on my ipod.

      GAY MILITIA STORMS CHRISTIAN MEETING  Bandanna-wearing lesbians stormed the national convention of the Concerned Christian Coalition April 17 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Seven women and one man burst into the conclave at the Coast Plaza Hotel, screaming, "Right-wing bigots go away, Gay Militia is here to stay."  According to the Calgary Sun, convention attendees held hands and prayed as the protesters unfurled a banner reading, "Liberation: Queer Invasion."  Police are reviewing tapes of the intrusion and may charge militia members with mischief or with disturbing a peaceful assembly, said Calgary police Constable Doug Jones.  ******************** (news from  urlLink Rex Wockner  (where else do I get this stuff?))******************  People, please, do we really have to give people a reason to fear and hate us? Are people just not paranoid enough for you? What gives?  Despite this completely irresponsible and banal act, I can't help but find a touch of humor that it was a group comprised solely of lesbians. Which isn't all that surprising because fatigues just are much too drab, dearie, for any self-respecting gay man to be seen in them.  Now if they'd just worn black, then it'd be kind of a Hefner thing. It says "I can fight all day in the jungle and in the evening, come in, put on some pearls and I'm ready for dinner." (with apologies to Robin Williams).

      I'm suddenly having flashbacks to Kermit the Frog as the Sesame Street newsreporter, so "Hi Ho Everybody"..  **FLASH** Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero promised to legalize same-sex marriage during an April 15 speech to Parliament.  **THIS JUST IN** The mayor of Bègles, France, plans to perform a same-sex marriage in June. Bègles is a suburb of Bordeaux.  There's nothing in French law to prohibit the marriage, Noël Mamère says, and gays should have full equal rights.  **BREAKING NEWS** The commission reviewing Portugal's Constitution approved adding a ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation April 23.  "Portugal is now one of the few countries in the world that include nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the fundamental law of the nation," said João Paulo, editor of the Web site PortugalGay.PT.  Other nations that ban antigay discrimination constitutionally include Canada, Ecuador, South Africa, Switzerland and, possibly, Fiji  (news from  urlLink Rex Wockner )  **AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT** The Virginia legislature recently passed House Bill 751, which states:   " A BILL to amend the Code of Virginia by adding a section numbered 20-45.3, relating to the Affirmation of Marriage Act for the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia:   1. § 20-45.3. Civil unions between persons of same sex.   A civil union,  partnership contract or other arrangement  between persons of the same sex purporting to bestow the privileges or obligations of marriage is prohibited. Any such civil union, partnership contract or other arrangement entered into by persons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall be void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights created thereby shall be void and unenforceable."    You can read the law for yourself  urlLink here .  What's so shocking about this bill is that it goes so far as to nullify any kind of legal arrangement including medical power of attorney or wills, even health insurance from domestic partner benefits at your workplace.  Not merely satisfied to prohibit us from entering into marriage or trying to compromise with a civil union, Virginia leaps back in time (well perhaps Virginia didn't have to do so much leaping in the first place; go visit Gay American's blog on his encounter with  urlLink Virginia's PR department ) to strip any kind of legal benefit we might have.    What the hell is wrong with people? Why am I so frightening because I want to have a few basic protections for my partner and me. Why does my existance as a law-abiding, productive citizen (and hell I'm a Protestant white male even) provoke such hatred, evil, and maliciousness? Other have said it and I've repeated it here, but marriage is the most conservative demand/request in the world.  The other major world powers see us as people worthy of dignity, rights, and respect, why do so many of my fellow Americans fail to rise to this level? We're a nation founded on bestowing proper rights, liberties, and responsibilities on people; we've struggled with it for centuries to grant it to all citizens. Why haven't we learned our lesson?

      Back in November, it was reported that the IOC was going to allow transsexuals to compete in the Olympics and now it seems to have become reality. What a wonderful historic moment, seems we're having lots of those lately.  The following is from  urlLink ESPN.com  and called to my attention by my friend and OBSW, Countess, since she knows I don't pay any attention to sports news.  Athletes who have had sex change now eligible  Associated Press LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- Transsexuals were cleared Monday to compete in the Olympics for the first time. Under a proposal approved by the IOC executive board, athletes who have undergone sex-change surgery will be eligible for the Olympics if their new gender has been legally recognized and they have gone through a minimum two-year period of postoperative hormone therapy. The decision, which covers both male-to-female and female-to-male cases, goes into effect starting with the Athens Olympics in August. The IOC had put off a decision in February, saying more time was needed to consider all the medical issues. Some members had been concerned whether male-to-female transsexuals would have physical advantages competing against women. Men have higher levels of testosterone and greater muscle-to-fat ratio and heart and lung capacity. However, doctors say, testosterone levels and muscle mass drop after hormone therapy and sex-change surgery. IOC spokeswoman Giselle Davies said the situation of transsexuals competing in high-level sports was "rare but becoming more common." IOC medical director Patrick Schamasch said no specific sports had been singled out by the ruling. "Any sport may be touched by this problem," he said. "Until now, we didn't have any rules or regulations. We needed to establish some sort of policy." Until 1999, the IOC conducted gender verification tests at the Olympics but the screenings were dropped before the 2000 Sydney Games. One of the best known cases of transsexuals in sports involves Renee Richards, formerly Richard Raskind, who played on the women's tennis tour in the 1970s. In March, Australia's Mianne Bagger became the first transsexual to play in a pro golf tournament.   Michelle Dumaresq, formerly Michael, has competed in mountain bike racing for Canada. Richards, now a New York opthamologist, was surprised by the IOC decision and was against it. She said decisions on transsexuals should be made on an individual basis. "Basically, I think they're making a wrong judgment here, although I would have loved to have that judgment made in my case in 1976," she said. "They're probably looking for trouble down the line. There may be a true transsexual -- not someone who's nuts and wants to make money -- who will be a very good champion player, and it will be a young person, let's say a Jimmy Connors or a Tiger Woods, and then they'll have an unequal playing field. "In some sports, the physical superiority of men over women is very significant."

      I fully believe in praying for our nation's leaders. They can use all the help they can get. We can only benefit as citizens by God doing some intervention with the current administration.  In this noble pursuit, an organizaiton has been formed, The  urlLink Presidential Prayer Team .  So, on the face of things, the PPT seems like a very noble and wise idea.  Instead, unfortunately, while it does have an Adopt-a-Troop program (and hey, you can get your very own PPT dogtag for a minimal donation), it serves as a facade for the Relgious Right.  Rather than just putting forth issues that the President and his administration could use guidance on, and asking God to lead them to the right conclusion, the PPT presupposes what the answer should be. They ask God, much like lawyers ask a judge, to bring our leaders to the proper predetermined outcome.    The PPT has requested that we: "Pray for the President as he seeks wisdom on how to legally codify the definition of marriage. Pray that it will be according to Biblical principles. With any forces insisting on variant definitions of marriage, pray that God's Word and His standards will be honored by our government."  Futhermore, the PPT has The Presidential Prayer Team has since October 2003 urged members to "pray for the President as he seeks wisdom on how to legally codify the definition of marriage. Pray that it will be according to Biblical principles."  Also, on  urlLink March 25, 2004 , they asked members to "pray for the ongoing effort to strengthen our nation by creating and passing a constitutional amendment codifying marriage as being only between a man and a woman.  Pray that godly values will be honored."   They even put up a picture in the October edition of a cute young white couple to remind us what American marriage is all about.  Nonetheless, as my partner, Peter, pointed out, "any good religious person believes prayer should be balanced by action."  Therefore, I present to you the new PPT (Peter's Prayer Team) and its revised goals in  support of a proposed Constitutional Amendment codifying marriage entirely on Biblical principles:  A. Marriage in the United States shall consist of a union between one man and one or more women. (Gen 29:17-28; II Sam 3:2-5.)  B. Marriage shall not impede a man's right to take concubines in addition to his wife or wives. (II Sam 5:13; I Kings 11:3; II Chron 11:21)  C. A marriage shall be considered valid only if the wife is a virgin. If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed. (Deut 22:13-21)  D. Marriage between a believer and a nonbeliever shall be forbidden. (Gen 24:3; Num 25:1-9; Ezra 9:12; Neh 10:30)  E. Since marriage is for life, neither this Constitution nor the constitution of any State, nor any state or federal law, shall be construed to permit divorce. (Deut 22:19; Mark 10:9)  F. If a married man dies without children, his brother shall marry the widow. If he refuses to marry his brother's widow or deliberately does not give her children, he shall pay a fine of one shoe and be otherwise punished in a manner to be determined by law.

      Many of the couples in my life who got married had to decide on a critical factor of the wedding: must they invite that one strange or obnoxious relative that they really don't want there, but feel obligated to invite because he/she is family?  In at least two of the weddings I can recall, the unwelcome, but still invited guest was an alcoholic who could have disrupted the solemn proceedings and/or caused a scene at some point in the ceremony or celebration following.  Fortunately, none of these fears came to pass.  So why must Uncle George make a scene at one of the happiest day for gay Americans and certainly the most monumental one since Stonewall, if not ever?  According to journalist  urlLink Rex Wockner , our esteemed (and frankly uninvited) President took time out to wish the newly married couples well:  "The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few activist judges... I called on the Congress to pass...an amendment to our Constitution defining and protectingmarriage as a union of a man and a woman as husband and wife. The need for that amendment is still urgent, and I repeat that call today."  Wockner reports that Uncle G.D. made this comment while travelling to commemorate "the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that ended racial segregation in schools."  Wockner rightly points to the irony of the situation, or, as Dubya would say, it's ironical.  Not to be outdone by noisy Uncle George, not-so-much Friend of the Family James Dobson proclaimed this day as the moment when "we will look back 20, 30, 50 years from now and recall this day as the day..[when]the documents being issued.. [that] may say 'marriage license' at the top...are really death certificates for the institution [of marriage]."    And again I get to ask how allowing people such as Paul McMahon, 71, and Ralph Hogdon, 69, life partners for 49 years, sounds the death kneel for a sacred institution.  Are these people concerned that we might have longer lasting marriages?  If queers start lowering the divorce rate, then I guess we really have flouted the institution of marriage. We will have wrecked the institution of 50% divorce rate.  If our marriages start lasting, on average, longer than hetereosexual marriages, I guess we will have made a mockery out of their lack of commitment.  In the end, however, the point of all of this is to wish the couples getting married today the best of luck and love.  I hope this is the start of something even more wonderful for them and the rest of us.  As for Uncle Dubya and neighbor Dobson, who put their names on the guest list? Never mind, hand me that bouquet, I know a perfect receptacle for it.

      First, I'd like to say my term has been co-opted by the more famous; designer Isaac Mizrahi has obviously been sneaking a peek at my blog and found the term "gay face."  If he'd only have given me credit, I wouldn't mind so much. Nonetheless, he makes an interesting point that minorities may have to have this transitionary period before acceptance, as he applies the term to the non-sexual, non-threatening, fairy godfathers of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy."  Additionally, he also made the observation that "it is crazy to think that just because you are gay you have a great sense of style."  Meanwhile, National Gay & Lesbian Task Force Executive Director Matt Foreman complained that "People [who watch TV] believe we are all single, rich white males ...and are all good at interior decorating. We need a more realistic portrayal of our lives."  Really people, if this is how we're viewed nowadays, is it that bad?  They could view us as insidious whore mongerers out to destroy Christianity, heterosexuality, western civilization, the sanctity of marriage, and boring wedding parties.  Oh wait...

       urlLink Rex Wockner  reports that during an interview with MTV, Presidential candidate John Kerry said:    "My feeling is that what is important is equal protection under the law.  An equal-protection clause, I think, pertains to the rights you give to people, not to the name you give to something, so I'm for civil unions.  That gives people the rights: the rights of partnership, the rights of inheritance of property, the rights of taxation and so forth. But I think there is a distinction between what we have traditionally called 'marriage' between a man and a woman and those rights. ... I believe very strongly that we can advance the cause of equality by moving toward civil unions. But that's where my position is at this point in time.  What is distinct is the institutional name. Whatever people look at as the sacrament within a church or within a synagogue or within a mosque as a religious institution, there is a distinction. The civil state really just adopted that. It's the rights that are important, not the name of the institution."   Okay, so why not just call it marriage again? I'm not sure who exactly is indicted by this statement. Is this a sad reflection our social climate, where a candidate who is, for all intents and purposes, in favor of a civil arrangement that is equal to marriage in every way, forced to call it by a different name? Or does this reflect poorly on Senator Kerry? If he's in favor of gay marriage, which it sounds like he is, shouldn't he just have the courage to admit it and call it what it is? The answer is probably both. Mr. Kerry can't hope to win if he comes out in favor of gay marriage, but dancing around the issue and coming up with a "separate but equal" plan is laughable. We all know how well "separate but equal" worked. Still, while complete candor would be welcome, civil unions could be a good transistory step on our way to federally recognized full-blown gay marriage.  Although, with gay marriage set to happen in mere hours in Massachusetts, who really needs a transition?  If Senator Kerry is proposing, however, that the government shouldn't be in the business of marriage at all, but rather leaving the sticky issue of marriage to religious institutions and creating civil unions, I'd find that pleasantly refreshing. This idea certainly isn't new, but, as far as I'm aware, this could be the first time a major political figure has suggested it (if that is what he is doing). If everyone is given a civil union in the eyes of the government, that certainly seems fair play all around. And then you have the option of joining a religious organization that supports the type of marriage you personally believe in.  Sounds like everybody wins, no matter how you spell it.

      Good grief, I knew it was coming, but you still hold out hope. Still, it's not like moving from Georgia to North Carolina made a huge difference, since Georgia has introduced it's own constitutional amendment.  Still, I don't think I hear of most of these proposed amendments trying to bar all forms of recognition for same-sex unions. That's just particularly thick icing on this devil's food cake.  I'm afraid that this will pass, however. North Carolina seems even more conservative than most of the Deep South, given that it's home to Billy Graham and much of the regional evangelicism, including the long-defunct Heritage USA. And given that the turnaround time for this amendment process is so quick, there is no time to show the gentle God-fearing populace of North Carolina that gay marriage won't bring about the next Soddom and Gamorrah. I'm still confused as to why a conservative request for marriage is more threatening and evil than gay people who choose to whore around and abuse drugs?   According to Equality NC, a statewide organization that advocates equal rights  and justice for North Carolina's lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender community:  Sen. Jim Forrester (R-Gaston), the newly-chosen Senate Minority  Leader, has filed a bill that seeks to amend the North Carolina  Constitution to discriminate against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender community.  North Carolina already discriminates against same sex couples by  denying us the right to marry, but Sen. Forrester's bill would  elevate that discrimination to the Constitutional level,' said Ed  Farthing, Executive Director/Development.  'The bill also seeks to  deny recognition of same-sex domestic partnerships, civil unions, or  other similar relationships recognized in other states.'    In order to become part of the Constitution, the amendment would  need to pass the North Carolina House and Senate by a three-fifths  margin; the amendment would then be placed before the voters on the  November ballot, where a simple majority is required for passage.

      Tonight the progress and acceptance that gay people have made in mainstream culture was surprisingly and pleasantly highlighted during the live television finale of  Survivor: All Stars  .  Host Jeff Probst was going around talking about love matches various All Star Survivors had made since being on the latest installment of the show that made reality television the phenomenon that it is today.  Some Survivors had connected with other Survivors (Amber and Boston Rob got engaged on the show tonight) and so Jeff was talking about other matches. He then brought up that since being voted off, Richard Hatch, the winner of the first Survivor, had found love during a cruise the show sent him on.  Richard said he met a man in Argentina and they had been together ever since.  I'm unsure, but it seemed as if the camera tried to pan to this man, but was unable to for some reason.  I was really struck that a gay romance was casually mentioned liked any of the straight romances and somewhat touted and celebrated on a major show on a major network. It was a nice touch and one the producers or Probst could have easily glossed over. I'm glad they had the courage not to do so.  I'm glad America is finally becoming a country where we can express our love openly and freely.

      Last Saturday, May 1, Charlotte, North Carolina held Charlotte Pride exceptionally early. Going on downtown simultaneously was "Taste of Charlotte" an outdoor food festival where numerous restaurants and chefs from Charloote shared their wares for partiers.  I'm not sure if there was an intentional connection, although certainly Pride is a very particular taste. A salty and slightly bitter one if I'm to understand correctly.  Charlotte has not had a Pride event for many years; in fact, this was the fourth annual Pride. The Charlotte community is to be commended for starting one up and having it be so successful. A nice aspect of Charlotte Pride was the holding of free educational seminars. I'm not sure how many Pride events have those, but I think it's a wonderful idea.  What was interesting to me, however, was mostly the conservative nature of the attendees.  I'm not being critical, just stating an observation.  I showed up in khaki shorts and a white t-shirt with an embroidered pride ribbon. I thought I was being very conservative myself, but found that almost nobody else was wearing any pridewear other than volunteers.  No "I'm not gay, but my boyfriend is" t-shirts, no dykes on bikes, and a surprisingly low number of people who don't know when to keep their shirt on.   There were three leather men strutting about, but that was about it for outrageous. Normally I would ranting about how the media only focuses on the most outlandish people who attend Pride, but none really existed.  So, as Pride season typically does, I began thinking about if Pride was needed any more and if Pride has value or serves a purpose. We've come a long way, baby; we're days away from the first full blown, legally recognized gay marriages.  Sodomy can no longer be used as a legal means to discriminate against us or lock us up.  Many major companies offer domestic partner benefits. Even the universities I have worked at in the South have domestic partner benefits, although being state institutions, they're limited to what the university itself provides, rather than the state (ergo, no insurance or medical/dental plans, etc.).  So, really other than knocking down DOMA laws once and for all, what's left to do? And although I'm not a fan (nor am I necessarily an opponent of) the more outlandishly or skimpily dressed Pride participants, if we're all just walking around Pride in every day casual dress with nothing at all to identify us as lesbigay and proud (like even dressing the same as your partner), then what's the point?  The point is that I still think that Pride is a wonderful place to experience the diversity of the gay community.  For people just coming out, or still in the closet, it's a wonderful opportunity to realize that, hey, there are people who are gay and like you or, hey, there are people gay and very different from me.  For the non-gay person, it shows them that actually it's hard to stereotype us.  You can't, for the most part, tell the gay people from the straight people at Pride except for who is kissing who (and that's not necessarily telling either).  We're all different shapes and sizes, of various dispositions and personalities, of various levels of hirsuiteness, of diifferent tastes in clothes, of different faiths, of different ethinicities and different ideas of fun.  Gay people are as hard to characterize as straight people. We're, well, we're all the colors of the rainbow.  In other words, we're like everybody else: different.  And I'm proud of that.

      Civil rights issues should not be put on the ballot. ... How is my marriage under attack if two gays or lesbians down the street want to make a lifelong commitment to themselves ... Love is bigger than government. Government should not have the right to tell you who you fall in love with and who you want to spend your life with. ... I don't like it when I see human rights violated. ... We are not the Hetero States of America. America should be inclusive, not separating."  --Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura speaking against the proposed Massachusetts constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, in an appearance at the Massachusetts Statehouse, March 22.  ************  "Gay marriage is simply not a civil rights issue. It is not a struggle for freedom. It is a struggle of already free people for complete  social acceptance and the sense of normalcy that follows thereof -- a struggle for the eradication of the homosexual stigma. Marriage is a goal because, once open to gays, it would establish the fundamental innocuousness of homosexuality itself. Marriage can say like nothing else that sexual orientation is an utterly neutral human  characteristic, like eye-color. Thus, it can go far in diffusing the homosexual  stigma."  --Shelby Steele writing in The Wall Street Journal, March 18.  *****************  "The fundamentalist Christians and the Catholic Church and the Republicans and the Bob Jones University assholes and the Fox media guys, they're not fun to hang around with. They're mean, and you can't have a normal conversation with them. So why bother?"  --Queer As Folk's Hal Sparks (Michael) to The Advocate, March 30.

      The  urlLink Human Rights Campaign  has announced that a vote will take place in the Senate in  early July  on the Federal Marriage Amendment to the US Constitution.  The HRC is asking everyone to please contact their Senators today and ask them to oppose this hateful legislation. Visit the  urlLink HRC action center  to easily email your Senators or to find text for a letter.  A little input could make a huge difference in our lives as American citizens.  Personally, I don't think the FMA has much chance of passing, but we cannot be complacent on this issue. We need to send a clear message  NOW  that this politicially-motivated and Religious-Right pandering homphobic piece of legislation is unacceptable and unAmerican.

      "The evil that men do lives after them,/ The good is oft interréd with their bones." So sayeth Marc Anthony in Shakespeare's  Julius Ceasar .  However, just as President Ronald Reagan dodge the bullet of Tecumseh's Curse, perhaps he has also dodged the Bard's bullet as well.    Perhaps it is the American way to build up our fallen leaders. We certainly seem to enjoy tearing them down while they are alive, but a dead American President tends to be a saint. Even Nixon has been much less maligned after death, while controversy swirls around Clinton and Bush the Second.    I was not out or even aware that I might be gay while Reagan was president. During the 80's I had a huge crush on my high school best friend, but had no idea that meant I was gay. As so we cross path with another friend of Julius Ceasar, Cleopatra, Queen of Denial.  In any event, I do not remember much about how he handled anything much less gay issues. Recent editorials concerning Reagan have shown that he didn't really get involved with any gay civil rights issues, mostly because gay civil rights was not a topic of national thought, concern, or debate.  It is generally conceeded that he ignored AIDS until almost the end of his presidency, when he made some initial attempts to combat it, although at that point it was too little too late. Many believe that his inaction allowed AIDS to progress much further than if research was carried out sooner.  We'll never know. And although AIDS was primarily a gay issue in the 80's, we all know now that AIDS is a human issue and not the "gay cancer" people believed it was two decades ago.  So, I don't have much of an opinion on how Reagan benefitted or hindered gays.  What does bother me, however, is the iconic status that has generally been bestowed upon him. He has become the Man Who Did No Wrong and most notably the Destroyer of Communism. I'm not a fan of the man, but I'm not out to villanize him either. I suspect that years from now we'll find out that, much like Woodrow Wilson, he was incapacitated for much of his second term and Nancy and his advisors ran the government.  Alzheimer's, upon initial symptoms, often sets in about five years or less.  And he was showing signs during his first half. Still, I'm not interested in that debate currently.  The man is quickly being lost in the myth. Like some Greek hero, he's becoming invincible and a conqueror of giants.  Some have called for his face to be added to Mount Rushmore. Others suggested replacing FDR's face on the dime. When Nancy objected, they suggested he share every other dime.  These are presidents who formed and gave direction to the country during crucial and unstable times. Reagan, for whatever good he did, was not even president during any particularly delicate time. Sure we had the Cold War going on, and everyone was afraid of Russia, but the country was not going through any true war or upheaval, as was the case with the presidents on these monuments and currency.  Class points to Nancy Reagan for nixing the dime idea and for also asking for her husband's image to be striken from a Bush political ad seeking to capitalize on the current groundswell of positive feeling for the departed President.   So let us pay our due respects to the dead, feteing what he accomplished, but tempered by his faults and errors. The Bard also reminds us in  Twelfth Night  that "some are born great, some achieve greatness and others have greatness thrust upon them." Let us not thrust greatness where it does not fit.

       The following comes from a column from the  Orlando Sentinel  on June 9, 1999. It just made me laugh.   Well, I spent three hours at the big Gay Days bash Saturday at the Magic Kingdom and didn't get hit on once.   Nobody likes older men anymore.   After talking to David Caton of the American Family Association, I expected a San Francisco-style gay parade. In fact, there were more traditional families than there were gays. And all the latter did was mill around, looking hot, eating ice cream, socializing, a few discreetly holding hands. Kind of what we all do at Disney. If not for the red shirts, I doubt anyone would have known it was Gay Days.   But I must say the lesbians were completely out of control.   Two hugged when greeting each other by Cinderella's Castle, and a couple on the ferry boat exchanged a quick peck.   If I had had my camera, I could have snapped off a picture for Dave to put on his Web page. The American Family Association says the event is designed for Disney and gay leaders to acclimate children to the hedonistic homosexual lifestyle.   Well, they did a darned poor job of it. The only thing the kids probably noticed was that the adults were hogging the line at Winnie the Pooh.

      Although you've probably rarely heard of him unless you like watching the cotton-candy hair changes of Jan Crouch on Trinity Broadcasting Nework, Benny Hinn is one of the most prominent modern faith healers. Most sensible people write him off as a sham and modern carpet bagger, and you can even find many Christian  urlLink websites  warning devotees of Hinn's errant teachings.  You can take Hinn about as seriously as you do Pat Robertson. Their predictions are about as accurate. Robertson claimed several years ago that Orlando was about to be devestated by a hurricane. (I believe because said devestation would take place for a reason related to Disney hosting gay days.) You'd think that a fairly safe prediction would have come true by now, but hasn't.  Far better and bolder than this predictionhowever is  urlLink one made by Hinn on December 31, 1989 , :  "The Lord also tells me to tell you in the mid 90's, about '94-'95, no later than that, God will destroy the homosexual community of America. [audience applauds] But He will not destroy it - with what many minds have thought Him to be, He will destroy it with fire. And many will turn and be saved, and many will rebel and be destroyed."  The prediction is laughable. It's so far-fetched, it's comical.  I wish Mitt Romney and some others could see that not even the threat of gay marriage has brought down this fire. Although it's hard to claim victory against such a controversial and fringe element like Hinn, still, Cheers, queers, we're still here!  What is not so laughable is that the audience claps right after Hinn says God will destroy the homosexuals. Now, this happened on the last day of the 80's, but it chills me to think that anybody who is supposed to be a follower of Christ would applaud the destruction of a people. (Although one has to wonder if God was going to destroy a particular community: the Castro? South Beach? Palm Springs? And will God be destroying gay Christians too? Or do we only get partially destroyed?)Maybe I'm forgetting the part where Jesus said to nuke thy neighbor.   Relgion doctrine aside, how do people really feel like this. Racist thought has been driven underground. It's not socially acceptible to be racist; that's the good part. The bad part is racism is now more covert and insidious. Homophobia is going down the same path.  Within the next decade we will likely have full civil marriage. We may have federal employment protection even. But we still have work to do with how people perceive us. We must continue to work to help people understand that being gay means you're like anybody else: different. Not better, not worse, just different. Let this extreme example remind us of the mainstream impact we have left to make.

      Fox network canned the upcoming reality show "Seriously Dude I'm Gay" where two straight contestants tried to convince friends and family they were gay for a monetary prize. Reports indicate that thecontestants found their experience "hell[ish]" and a "nightmare."  Fox decided to cancel after prescreenings with  urlLink GLAAD  and other groups did not go well.   I am also glad that Fox, for once, displayed taste and decorum. Lately they had been travelling the Jerry Springer route to fame, trying to out-low themselves with each new show. Out of the litany of reality programming Fox has brought us: Joe Millionaire, Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire, Paradise Hotel, Forever Eden, Temptation Island, Mr. Personality, The Littlest Groom, and My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance (among others), none have shown the slightest modicum of respect or decorum towards their contestants or the audience. Luckily, this long list clearly demonstrates that Fox is an equal opportunity humiliator and opportunist. It's hard to call them homophobic when they haven't exactly done the straight community any service.  Still, the fact the network thought the show stood a chance does point to America's latent homophobia. The show was originally marketed with the phrases "It's a heterosexual male's worst nightmare: turning gay overnight" and "a jury of their queers."  Even though these phrases were pulled even before the show itself was, this is a clear indicator that, and they were probably right, most Americans would be drawn to the show because being gay is still seen as humiliating and degrading. Reality shows for the most part are just freak shows at best; The Littlest Groom is obviously evidence of the circus having come to television.   So it is with us queers. If being gay were not still seen as something undesirable, freakish, or lurid, shows like this would not be made. Probably shows like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy would not be made because people wouldn't care. To me, being gay is something special and distinctive about myself. I take pride in being gay. I don't want to lose what I perceive to be almost a cultural distinction as we gain the civil rights and acceptance we deserve. Nonetheless, we still have a lot of education and outreach to do to change the way our fellow human beings (particularly American citizens) see us. Getting rights does not mean losing distinction. But getting rights does not mean gaining acceptance. We still have a road of activism we must travel after gaining our full rights; that's just the reality of the situation.

      This year's Tony Awards was an even gayer celebration than usual. Super-hot host Hugh Jackman aside, several shows with gay stories, characters, and/or themes took home the more prominent awards.  AVENUE Q which features the hysterical yet affirming song, "If You Were Gay" along with "Fantasies Come True" by Rod, a puppet in the closet, took home Best Musical, Best Original Score, and Best Book. Avenue Q is an irreverant, non-PC musical comedy featuring puppets and live actors that features other songs such as "Everyone's a Little Bit Racist" and "The Internet is for Porn."  It definitely carries queer sensibilities,although not exclusively a gay story.  Hugh Jackman took home Leading Actor in a Musical for THE BOY FROM OZ. This play showcases the life of Peter Allen, the gay ex-husband of Liza Minelli, and famous song writer who died of AIDS in the 80's.    I AM MY OWN WIFE took home Best Play and the leading (and only) actor, Jefferson Mays, took home the Leading Actor in a Play award.  This one man show is about Charlotte von Mahlsdorf, a real-life German transvestite who survived both the onslaught of the Nazis and the repressive Communist regime that followed after World War II.  It's nice to see such strong support for works of art featuring gay themes and characters, particularly in a year that has seen polarization around gay issues. It could have been easy for voters to be turned off from all the "gay hype" and go with potentially less controversial or, in their eyes perhaps trendy, choices.

      According to Vh1's "Best Month Ever" show, the cowboy from 70's disco gay super-group The Village People has married. What, didn't know the VP were gay?  A little googling revealed this AP article:   NEW YORK - The cowboy from the Village People has gotten married. MTV News reports Randy Jones married acid lounge artist Will Grega Friday at a New York club.   Grega and Jones have been together for 20 years. Grega proposed that night and they were married on the spot.   Gay marriage is still illegal in New York state, but Jones says, "It's only a matter of time before the courts rule in favor of what's morally right and humanly decent." Grega, meanwhile, points out, "I have a lifetime membership to the YMCA."   It kills me not knowing if the perennially favorite wedding reception song "YMCA" was used for the happy copule.

      Apparently some gays are mad at Califohniah Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for his recent comment calling some Democratic politicians "girlie men."&nbsp; I say we shouldn't be mad at him for making any type of allegedly "homophobic" remark, we should be mad at him for using an ancient and annoyingly over-repeated&nbsp;pop-culture reference best left in the grave with Dana Carvey's career.  Oh, and&nbsp;no blog entries for at least a week; I've got to move this weekend and then I'm off on a business trip. Be good while I'm gone.

      According to 365gay.com, Mike White, the head of the Oregon Family Council, said that he hoped that Lynne Cheney "doesn't address the gay marriage issue " at the Oregon state Republican convention and that he was "troubled" that she refused to endorse the Federal Marriage Amendment.&nbsp;   Furthermore, Mr. White, who clearly suffers from severe cranial-rectal inversion, further stated that "[s]he is here to rally support for the president, and common sense would saythat she will only make remarks on issues she and the president agree on."&nbsp; Fortunately, the Oregon GOP Chairman Kevin Mannix was tactful enough to just comment that the convention is"just delighted that she's coming. She's an excellent speaker."   I suppose that Mr. White would also favor Mrs. Cheney's, and probably all his female's constituents' &nbsp;silence in any religious matters, given Paul's command that "Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. / And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church." (I Corinthians 14:33-34).&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, what do women know about anything other than cooking and homekeeping?   A mother bear is&nbsp;not begrudged&nbsp;for protecting her&nbsp;cub, but Mrs. Cheney apparently should sit passively by and say nothing while legislation that would negatively impact her daughter tries to pass.&nbsp; Mr. White's suggestion that Mrs. Cheney should ignore a threat to&nbsp; her child is an&nbsp;interesting family value.&nbsp; Why can't Lynne follow Laura Bush's example of having&nbsp;no personality&nbsp;and letting her man make all the decisions?&nbsp;  Common sense seems to dictate, in this case, that Mr. White should only make remarks on issues that don't expose him as a hypocrite and dolt.&nbsp; Or to quote a non-Biblical piece of advice, "Best to be silent and thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."

      From the gay spiritual magazine,   urlLink White Crane  , an exerpt from an article by Timothy Leary on same-sex love:  So, if God did not approve of homosexuality, God would not allow homosexuals to actually love one another. Homosexual people would only be able to experience the physical sensations of sex, but not know the rich life-giving experience of shared ecstasy. We would not know that sensation of being lost in ecstasy with another human being. The idea that same-sex love creates ecstasy and direct experiences of the Divine is frightening to people who want (or need) these cultural myths about heterosexual-only romantic love to be true. They do not want to face the idea that God may not care who makes love with whom. From their perspective it's OK if what queer people experience is furtive and hollow, but they dare not assume that we can actually experience real ecstasy. That would mean that God approves of our love because God is involved in it. Perhaps that is why the idea of same-sex marriage is so threatening. It shakes many ideas of love and sex to the core.   As long as same-sex couples can be seen as people who do not, or cannot, love in the same way as heterosexual people, we can be discriminated against. If our experiences of love are incomplete we do not need to be treated as fully human. If our relationships were accepted as loving and life affirming, the entire tenor of the debate over same-sex marriage, and queer civil rights in general, would have to change. If the layer of sentimentalism about heterosexual-only romantic love were lifted, it would blow the "God Hates Fags" arguments right out of the water.   The idea that heterosexual-only romantic love comes from God is a key factor in the mind-set of the religious right and those who oppose our right to live our lives freely and openly. This idea makes it possible to objectify us, demonize us and discount our loving relationships. Our love is thought to be of less value because it is thought to be for only furtive pleasure. Opponents of queer rights and same-sex marriage ignore us when we say that our relationships are life-affirming because it is important for them to believe that the Divine is not involved in our relationships. They are wrong about this.

      I was listening to a  urlLink fascinating interview  with journalist Hendrik Hertzberg on NPR the other day. Hertzberg served as President Carter's speechwriter for a time and is author of a recent book,&nbsp;&nbsp; Politics: Observations and Arguments, 1966-2004 . He was being interviewed about many different areas of interest, but the interview began with a look at the term "liberal" and the "far left."&nbsp; The author noted that the far left does not exist any longer. The far left was truly alive during the 60's various civil movements and has actually become now the "far right" with the various militias and "people..who blew up Oklahoma City."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hertzberg bemoans the demonization of the term "liberal" and bemoans the fact that "progressive" has replaced it, since, for Hertzberg, liberty (the root of liberal) is a better virtue that progress.&nbsp; He also rightly comments on how "liberal" and "far left" are both inappropriately applied to John Kerry, and, in general, are grossly misused to stir controversy.  &nbsp;  Arguably, Kerry strides the liberal fence, although Republicans seeking to villify John Edwards as a liberal clearly have no conception of what the word means. For a North Carolina politician, the man is a bleeding-heart, but on a wide-scale, he's a step away from Republicanism.  &nbsp;  Like Hertzberg I've also thought that "liberal" is a weak attempt at an insult. Why do people consider it insulting. People who are truly liberal must shed the label often just to be heard.&nbsp; Yet conservative retains a positive connotation largely, when conservative politicians have continued to put power and advantage in the hands of large corporations at the expense of working citizens.  &nbsp;  Prior to this broadcast, I was struck by a sermon from a local church broadcast on televison. The preacher railed on about the homosexual agenda and how homosexuals were working against traditional marriage. This was no simple country preacher; the man seemed educated and well-spoken.&nbsp; How then can he, like so many in the Religious Right, draw such a simple distinction between "homosexual" and "Christian."&nbsp; People use the terms like they are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Just as one can be Southern and Catholic, one can be homosexual and Christian.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Even from a theological perspective, there is no exclusion. Even if homosexuality is viewed in the context of being sin, the gospels boldly proclaim that all people are sinners . How is this one supposed sin worse or different?&nbsp; Again, words are used thoughtlessly and perhaps purposefully to hurt and divide.  &nbsp;  All of which leads up to my most recently fume-inducer. Bill James is the Mecklenberg County Commissioner. (Mecklenberg is the county where Charlotte is located.&nbsp; I happen to live just outside of the county in Cabarrus County.)&nbsp;&nbsp; James is a fundamentalist with a mission: define or redefine the county according to his faith. According to the July 7-13 edition of the Charlotte  Creative Loafing , James commented that he "[doesn't] know any liberal preachers of note anymore.&nbsp; the left doesn't seem to have any activist ministers...Liberals in Charlotte have given up...and won't even bring up gay rights.&nbsp; I don't know if there are any true liberals in Charlotte."  &nbsp;  Actually, many liberal voices exist around Charlotte, no matter how James or his allies may try to drown them out.&nbsp; This mere statement angers me for its complete dismissal of many good men and women who are fighting the good fight in the region.&nbsp; It's the view of a man who probably sees anyone or anything that disagrees with him as, if not non-existant, inconsequential.  &nbsp;  James, who&nbsp;opposes benefits for unmarried couples (gay or straight) and&nbsp;who thankfully&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;pass recently a bill prohibiting gays and lesbians from being foster parents or adopting,&nbsp;&nbsp;is proud of his attack on&nbsp;a&nbsp;1997 production of  Angels in America  at the Charlotte Repetory Theatere.&nbsp;&nbsp; James proudly and smugly sees himself as the man to "rid society of behavior that is un-Christian and wrong."&nbsp; He also implies that liberals can't be true Christians because liberals "historically [have] this inability to accept that Christ is the only way to God...Without the anchor of Christianity...they just make it up as they go along."  &nbsp;  James's actions and words mark him as the mean and stupid individual that he is.&nbsp; Clearly ignorant of anything outside his own world-view, he lacks the meekness, compassion&nbsp;and humility that Christ exhibited in His ministry.&nbsp; Still, they are but words from a small man and, as they say," sticks and stones".&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Bush continues to try and sell the line that a few special individuals (like, say, the same ones&nbsp; who put him in office) are trying to redefine the institution of marriage, an institution that hasn't changed for hundreds if not thousands of years. I find it interesting that Bushie wants to maintain and/or establish an enduring definition of &nbsp;marriage.  &nbsp; The Constitution was established to be able to adapt to the needs and demands of the times and people. Many religious texts, the Bible included, are understood differently given societal changes and advancements. Shakespeare, for example, while rooted firmly in his time, has themes, situations, and characters that are so universal, they are easily enjoyed and understood by modern audiences or are readapted with modern dressings.   If a society or a people want to redefine marriage, they should be able to. I find it interesting that although the Bible explicitedly prohibits women from being church leaders or even speaking in church, many evangelical leaders and ministers are women today. Why? We have different cultural understandings and values. Sounds a little hypocritical doesn't it to ignore or reinterpret one part and not another?   I'm tired of this slippery slope argument that says gay marriage leads to cats and dogs living together, mass hysteria. Society always has the right to draw a line in the sand. We can say two men marrying is fine, but marrying your sister or daughter is not. Laws are a negotiation among different people for a common understanding. We may think one thing is fine, but not another. People said the EXACT SAME THINGS about interracial marriage. I don't think Rome is burning quite yet.   As for Bush, regardless of his belief, he is using this issue as a way to solidfy his base of the Religious Right and other conservatives. It's disgusting. He's playing with my citizenship and making a statement about my worth as a human being and American citizenship for political gain. I loathe the chimp that is Bush.   Do you want an American theocracy? Then vote for the Federal Marriage Amendment (FMA).   If this amendment were to be ratified, this would only encourage and fortify the position and power of the Religious Right. Already the false idol of the Republican party, this movement will not be satisfied with making homosexuals second-class citizens.&nbsp;  Fundamentialist&nbsp;continue to define our great nation in the image they think is morally correct. I'm trying to avoid a slippery slope argument here, but it is not too hard to see that we could easily be headed for even more breakdown between state and religion.&nbsp; Recently on Charlotte public access, I heard a conservative minister extolling the virtues of Christians becoming involved in politics. Indeed, this is one of the few points I agreed on with the man. People of all religions, as a matter of fact, should be encouraged to run for public office.&nbsp; Mostly because if only Fundamentialist run, they will continue a clear agenda for setting the moral code by their faith. &nbsp; Fundamentalists seem to completely miss the point of the Christian faith. The whole gospel, indeed the entire message of the Bible, is about people choosing God.&nbsp; God never imposes Himself on people.&nbsp; Yet, Fundamentalists seek to remove the choice that is our God-given right.&nbsp; As an aside, I find it interesting to note that most Fundamentalists are economically conservative,&nbsp; cutting money to charitable organizations. I personally think that Christianity, taken to its logical extreme, leads to a very socialistic society.&nbsp; In any event, Fundamentalists labor under the delusion that they are, at any moment, about to be thrown to the lions for the hedonist secular throng. So, apparently, their tactics is to turn the lions loose on the public (or worse, try to invoke God to divinely punish the great unwashed masses). &nbsp; Secondly, Fundamentalists assert that they are returning us to our great Christian foundation as a country. Much has been written and debated on this subject, and I don't have the time, length, or energy to get into it here, but a quick perusal of information on this matter leads to the conclusion that while some of the founding fathers were Christian, many were not.&nbsp; Most certainly weren't the raving evangelicals we know today.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Regardless of their religious faith, this country was established with the promise of freedom of a state-imposed religion. Part of the creation of this country was for the exercise of whatever religion you wanted to. Trying to re-create a "Christian" nation is wrong both theologically, morally, and historically.&nbsp; Yet,&nbsp;under the guise of persecution,&nbsp;Fundamentalists seek to create a theocratic society.&nbsp;And we all see how well theocracy works in the middle East.&nbsp; You think Calvin Klein will be excited to design burkas for the modern working woman? Oops, wait, she can't work.&nbsp; Never mind. &nbsp; Despite what the Religious Right tells us, I don't feel like God is dangling us over the flames of hell like a spider over a fire&nbsp; so much as we are dangling over a fire created by these zealots. A fire probably created by book burning and the destruction of our Bill of Rights. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well, the FMA has been delayed for now by the failure to pass cloture in the Senate. I've been trying to fully understand the ramifications of the vote. At one point I heard that Republicans were actually filibustering their own bill, trying to buy time to raise more "yes" votes. Some politicians felt this would actually work against them, losing more votes, so it seems Republicans moved for an end of discussion, or cloture.  The failure to pass cloture means that debate can continue indefinitely on the bill, although C-SPAN notes that it means the bill is usually just set aside.  So, many are calling this a victory. Certainly from the perspective that 50 "Nay" votes is 19 less votes than needed to pass a full amendment in the Senate, we have a victory. However, this was a procedural vote largely. So, in some respects, it was easy to vote against ending discussion. Legislators can easily still say they oppose the amendment, but feel like more discussion is needed before passing a Constitutional Amendment.   I feel somewhat badly because I only tried twice to contact my Senators and when the lines were busy did not try again.  I feel less bad because my two Senators are Elizabeth Dole and John Edwards. Libby (R - in case you're living under a rock) was not going to be swayed. I understand why Bob needs viagra with her around the house. And, John, well John didn't vote. Neither did Kerry.   According to the  Washington Post  the two of them would have voted if they were needed, but with a clear win apparent, they abstained. This doesn't cut it with me. They just didn't want to be seen taking a stand for political reasons. And so they avoided the bullet. Still, they're better than the alternative, Mr. "I'm disappointed, but keep on bashin' those gays" Bush.    On a side note, both Senators from my previous home state of Georgia voted to invoke cloture, presumably in favor of the amendment. If I were still there, I would actively campaign to get Zell Miller, the Democratic Senator, out of office as soon as I could.  And after all is said and done, wouldn't have passing cloture been a good thing? Politically it is advantageous for Senators running for re-election. They can say they don't support gay marriage, but feel like we need to think about a big step like this. But, if cloture had passed, then they could have voted and, presumably, defeated the Amendment. Am I misunderstanding this?  Wouldn't this have been the true victory?  Still, I'll take it however I can get it. It's an encouraging sign, but just the start of the long haul. Things, I suspect, will get worse before they get better. Nonetheless, I'm cautiously optimistic and see this as certainly a good thing. I'm just don't see us in the winner's circle quite yet.

       A friend sent this to me; don't know where it originates from, but found it fairly amusing...   &nbsp;   The discovery that affiliation with the Republican Party is genetically determined was announced by scientists in the current issue of the journal NURTURE, causing uproar among traditionalists who believe it is a chosen lifestyle.  Reports of the gene coding for political conservatism, discovered after a decades-long study of quintuplets in Orange County, CA, has sent shock waves through the medical, political, and golfing communities.  Psychologists and psychoanalysts have long believed that Republicans'  unnatural disregard for the poor and frequently unconstitutional tendencies resulted from dysfunctional family dynamics.  A remarkably high percentage of Republicans do have authoritarian domineering fathers and emotionally distant mothers who didn't teach them how to be kind and gentle. Nonetheless, biologists have long suspected that conservatism is inherited.  "After all," said one author of the NURTURE article, "It's quite common for a Republican to have a brother or sister who is a Republican." The finding has been greeted with relief by Parents and Friends of Republicans (PFREP), who sometimes blame themselves for the political views of otherwise lovable children, family, and unindicted co- conspirators.  One mother, a longtime Democrat, wept and clapped her hands in ecstasy on hearing of the findings. "I just knew it was genetic," she said, seated with her two sons, both avowed Republicans. "My boys would never freely choose that lifestyle!" When asked what the Republican lifestyle was, she said, "You can just tell watching their conventions in Houston and San Diego on TV: the flaming xenophobia, flamboyant demagogy, disdain for anyone not rich - you know."  Both sons had suspected their Republicanism from an early age but did not confirm it until they were in college, when they became convinced it wasn't just a phase they were going through and "came out".  The NURTURE article offered no response to the suggestion that the high incidence of Republicanism among siblings could result from their sharing not only genes but also psychological and emotional attitude as products of the same parents and family dynamics.  A remaining mystery is why many Democrats admit to having voted Republican at least once -- or often dream or fantasize about doing so. Polls show that three out of five adult Democrats have had a Republican experience, although most outgrow teenage experimentation with Republicanism.  Some Republicans hail the findings as a step toward eliminating conservophobia. They argue that since Republicans didn't "choose" their lifestyle any more Than someone "chooses" to have a Roman nose, they shouldn't be denied civil rights which other minorities enjoy.  If conservatism is not the result of stinginess or orneriness (typical stereotypes attributed to Republicans) but is something Republicans can't help, there's no reason why society shouldn't tolerate Republicans in the military or even high elected office -- provided of course that they don't flaunt their political beliefs.  For many Americans, the discovery opens a window on a different future. In a few years, gene therapy might eradicate Republicanism altogether.  But should they be allowed to marry?

      The Great Uniter of our nation said this past February that "The union of a man and a woman is the most enduring human institution, honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith."  This week the Senate is debating the Federal Marriage Amendment to see if marriage can "be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots without weakening the good influence of society," as the President believes it cannot. This debate is being carried out for the sole purpose of forcing a vote during an election year. This is a tactic of the proponents of the amendment.  The President, an expert on historical and international affairs further commented earlier this year that, "After more than two centuries of American jurisprudence and millennia of human experience, a few judges and local authorities are presuming to change the most fundamental institution of civilization,"  Definitely the expert on confusion, our President further stated that "their actions have created confusion on an issue that requires clarity."   I agree this is an issue of much confusion. Let me provide a little clarity. Since many of the proponents of the FMA point to the emphasis the Bible puts on family and traditional marriage, and argue that gay marriage would certainly undermine these great institutions, I thought I would investigate what the Bible has to say about this great institution.  Now, mind you, the following is a strict literalist interpretation of the Bible, which is just as most evangelicals would have it. No need to be throwing confusing details like historical context or linguistic nuances in there.  We start off with a very cheerful passage in Hebrews 13:4  Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure...   Although perhaps if we should all honor marriage, then we should let gay people marry. I know, I know, I'm being silly.  But other passages paint a very different view of the great institution of marriage. Paul the Apostle, who causes most Baptists to just salivate with Pavlovian glee upon mention of his name, isn't so keen on the idea of marriage.  I Corinthians 7:1  It is good for a man not to marry  7:8-9  Now to the unmarried and the widows I say: It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am. / But if they cannot control themseles, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.   Sure, Paul ends up saying, "go ahead and marry," but it's just so you won't have sex outside of wedlock. That's a fairy-tale wedding come true. Get married so you can get knocked up.   That house with a dog, and a kid, and a white picket fence? Forget it. Paul makes it clear later on, (v. 28)  But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.   Why is Paul so down on marriage? Verse 33-34 explains it,  a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world - how he can please his wife - /and his interests are divided [between this and God] .  Paul just wants us to  live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.  (v 35)  And apparently Paul isn't so far out on a limb here. Jesus said it first in Matthew 19:9-11 [Jesus replied,]  "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery." / The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry." / Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given."   Romans 7:3 also emphasizes that if you divorce while your spouse is still alive, and you re-marry, you are commiting adultery. Why aren't we passing an Adultery Marriage Amendment?  Ultimately, though, I guess marriage isn't all that important to God. Jesus makes it clear in Matthew 22:30  At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage.  The ties that bind apparently are truly until death do you part. God doesn't do windows nor weddings.  Oh, and for all of you with mail-order brides or wives from another country, repent sinners:   You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt. ...Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and your foreign wives. Ezra 10:10  So, why bother with the FMA? If these Bible passages are to be believed, God doesn't seem to be all gung-ho over marriage.  I guess if we're saying we value it now, then the institution has changed over millenia. Or maybe Dubya is calling God a liar.    Come to think of it, if wedding is about all of this, why don't we let them pass it?

      June 26 was Gay Pride in Atlanta and San Francisco. There was no way to get to San Fran (although some day I would love to experience Pride there), and Atlanta was on the list. I hadn't been in a few years and thought it would be fun to return.  But I did something better. I celebrated Pride with my partner at a celebration of two women's love for each other. We went to the ten year celebration of our friends Anne and Leslie, joining in recognition of their commitment with friends and family of theirs.    Clearly, the sanctity of marriage is highly threatened. I think straight people are probably just jealous that their ceremonies aren't as much fun or don't have nearly as fabulous food.    Good food, good drink, and good times were all had. And not a mullet or flannel shirt to be found anywhere.  I think the most touching moment for me was when the father of one the women toasted them, stating he was happy to have gained two daughters.  May every parent realize they stand to gain two daughters or two sons; may people everywhere realize they stand to gain two friends or two church members or two bingo players or two neighbors with fabulous taste or the ability to fix your sink. May everyone realize that they only stand to gain more love in the world.

      Keith, thanks for the kind words.   Never fear, I shall not disappoint my entire readership of what, three, at most? No, the blogging continues despite the whirlwind of changes, most good, one bad, that have happened in a two week span.  About three weeks ago, my partner, Peter, who lives in Atlanta, found out his apartment complex was going to be destroyed to make way for assisted living housing. His lease runs out in August, so he decide that this was a pretty good sign from God that it was time to make to move up with me in Charlotte. We had planned on this eventually, but not for another year.  Since he's working on his doctorate, he has been unemployed other than a graduate assistantship.  The weekend of June 26, lesbian friends of ours celebrated their 10th anniversary together. Peter came up for that event and thought he would stay through July 5 so we could look for a bigger apartment than the one I have now for the both of us. (Conveniently, my lease expires in August also).  No apartment complex really struck us as quite the right fit. We settled on one, only to feel like it was not the best choice for us, and then pulled the application.  We ended up almost buying a house, but, in the nick of time, realized we were not ready for that step, particulary given Peter's unemployment and the fact that we had no idea what we are doing. (As an aside, we now have a great book "100 Questions Every First Time Home Buyer Should Ask" to help us when we are ready - I'm strongly recommend it.)  During this time, the technology person for my department quit after working six days. And before you know it, Peter has a job replacing this guy! Simply amazing!  We also seem to have located the nicest townhouse to rent. We're still waiting for everything to be finalized, but it's looking good. Keep your fingers crossed for us.  Hopefully by Monday we will know. If we get it, it'll be a perfect place for us.  Karma is a bitch, however, and this is no exception. My parents received some unfortunate news this week that was shocking.  I will not get into it here, other than to say that my parents have been completely wronged by small-minded (and probably small-endowed) selfish scared little men.  So, my life has been a rollercoaster that is not slowing down. Not only does the emotional peaks and valleys continue, but physical hills still exist. One of the busiest times of the year for my job is upon me in three weeks and we are planning on moving by the end of July because there's no better time before the end of August with our multiple obligations.  So, the blog may be slow for a bit while my life is slowing rearranging itself. But I look at it like this, once we land, there'll be no place like home.
