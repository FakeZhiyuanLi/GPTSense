      On NPR today, they had a breif analysis of the new Air America network (snicker).  I have to admit, I listen to it more than any one, including any liberals, I know.  But it's for the entertainment value, and I don't mean laughing  with  them.  Anyway, NPR called them 'just another network' and said the only thing that could save them was somethin I can't remeber, anyway.  I'm so glad the self-proclaimed "most feared thing on the planet" will have to watch itself crumble very quickly.  Yes, that's evil.  And yes, it's Holy Saturday.  We are all sinners.

      I row on my school's crew team, and we had early morning practice on the Chicago River today.  It really gave me some peaceful time to think and mull, so I'd encourage everyone today to take some time out for yourselves and just think.  Being as it is Good Friday, you could even make it part of your prayers.  Meh.  Just a suggestion.

      I just read that former president Clinton testified before the 9/11 Commission shortly after Condi....  behind closed doors.   It was stated that much of what he said would not be released because it might be classified.  Personally, I'd much rather hear the testimony of a man at the helm for EIGHT YEARS than of a woman in a lower position than the president.  But that might be damaging, God (whoops) forbid, to the partisan efforts of the Commission.  Double standards are victorious again.

      Well, I was listening to Air America (soon to be RIP, I'd wager) after Condi's testimony, and was heartened by the fact that the focus of the left's attacks were on Dr. Rice's opinion that "nothing" should have been done in response to the USS Cole attack.  If the best liberals are coming up with is attacks of "what if" history on someone who wasn't in responsibility at the time, we should all laud, or at least grudgingly admire, Condoleezza's performance under pressure.  By the way, the Air America host, I didn't catch her name, said that the station had a hard time getting on the air because it was "the most feared thing on earth."  And with ratings like these , you should have much less trouble getting off it.  urlLink

      Let's admit it.  We're all liars.  Or at least half-truthers.  But when I think about all the lying I do in a day, I can't begin to imagine the silver tongue of a politician.  Granted, I can't know how much exactly of what they say is true, but in a position with that much responsibility, I'd bet my bottom dollar the temptation to trick the truth is there.  Now, all that lying and acting builds up, so you have to tell someone.  I have a close friend, a confidant, who knows more about me than anyone.  So ponder, if you will, being the confidant of a powerful politician... the knowledge, and therefore the power, one would have with that post.  And maybe the reform that would ferment if these confidants came clean... but I believe in loyalty and trust too much to advocate full disclosure.  So I'll end with an ode to our confidants.   When I tell the truth I trust in you To keep the truth away From the masses Seething, eating at my trust in you each day.  I have said to them I never lied  To you when I did speak But the truth was slant I never knew And it slowly made me weak.

      Some days ago at school, the authorities dictated a "Peace and Justice week" for the masses.  We would all be given our John Lennon pins (no lie) and participate in anti-Iraq innuendated prayers each morning.  (We'll ignore the fact that the Jesuits are advocating the position of a man who once sang "and no religion, too.")  Well, I refused to wear my pin, as I had done several months before with the "No War" pins that the  school  itself was  selling at a price  to the students.  Well, not following Der Lefter Fuhrers orders can get you in quite some trouble here at school.  Asswads I didn't know at all would approach me in the hall and ask where my pin was.  I eventually tired of this nonsense and had a friend give me their No War pin, which, thanks to white out and scotch tape, soon read Go War.  I had my pin.  I'm so sick of the political double standards that run deep through this school, not to mention this city.  Last year, several students  walked out of school  to attend an anti-war rally, and returned without so much as a slap on the wrist.  I can't even imagine the uproar that would ensue if anyone tried to attend a "pro-America" rally, considering American flags are routinely taken off lockers and thrown away.  So, I do my best to fight back.  There's a surprising amount of quiet conservatives wherever you may look.  They're just not as loud and boisterous as the minority radicals, who twist everything to their favor, regardless of the consequences.  Lets bring some truth and justice to everyone, not just the cogs of the Democratic party machine.

      To be honest, I don't actually have a flag on my backpack.  With the way the zippers are set up and all, it wouldn't fit.  But the Stars and Stripes are safety-pinned on there in spirit, an invisible spite to those anti-American little brats I tolerate every day.  These people, of all the annoying, arrogant, and selfish souls I know in this world, are the worst.  They somehow feel that attending one of the most prestigious Catholic schools in the city of Chicago is a "dungeon" to them.  Let's dissect these folks in detail:  Social:  The "asswads," as we'll call them, can be separated into two distinct social groups.  One group is the "suis" (short for "suicidals") also known, as punks, anarchists, etc.  Yes, you know who I'm talking 'bout, Willis.  dressing in black, listening to punk rock, and writing "woe is me" poetry in the shitter stall.  Far from being anti-social, these asswads flock together in a hostile pack of raving, yelling, spiky-haired pricks.  The second group, one I find much more distasteful, are the ungratefuls.  These rich, preppy kids have been given the best America has to offer, but claim they "hate it" and will "move out" when they're old enough.  Unfortunately, few do.  Sipping their Bacardi as they pretend to care about 'lying Bush' and the war in Iraq, I spit on them collectively.  Political:  Well, I think I've already made clear their political viewpoints.  Rabis anti-Americanism and anti-Bushism.  They obviously never learned that a venture based on a mutual declaration hate instead of a declaration of love is bound to fail.  Religious:  Aha, this gets funny.  I would dare to say that a majority of the asswads are "idiotarian teen atheists."  Instead of making an effort to understand or enhance the catholic faith most were brought up with, asswads like to put on a sophisticated air of marijuana-induced enlightenment... well fuck that.  Goddam, just writing this makes me angry.  I'll try to pick a lighter topic next time.  Iggy

      Welcome, welcome.  Ever since stumbling upon such heroes as the Anti-Idiotarian Rottweiler, Rachel Lucas, and Charles at lgf, I've wanted to start a blog, but have been too lazy to get around to it.  Well, since I'm not too busy today, I decided to start it.  I hope everyone enjoys it, and I'll start regular posting tomorrow.  Iggy

      Oh boy.&nbsp; I went to the Barenaked Ladies concert at the Tweeter Center last night, and it was AMAZING.&nbsp; The band, I mean, not that the center was bad or anything... but anyway, they are so entertaining and have this fun, complex sound.&nbsp; Even if they are Liberal (and from Canadia :p) they manage to remember that they are first entertainers, and then political creatures.&nbsp; Alanis, who was touring with them, was a pleasantly rocking surprise.  But recently, I've been obsessed woth 'Float On' by Modest Mouse.&nbsp; Talk about superb music.&nbsp; I'm singing it out loud right now actually.  I'll be posting some political stuff later.&nbsp; I've been looking high and low for my epic 'Ode to Liberals' poem I wrote for English class this year.&nbsp; Hopefully I find it, and you enjoy.

      Woohoo!&nbsp; I'm finally home.&nbsp; It was a great trip.&nbsp; We spent the week painting a widow's house, who was so generous and delightful.&nbsp; On the last day, she made us jambalaya, fried chicken and a homemade cake.&nbsp; On our free day, we went to the French Quarter, er, Vieux Carre and the Rue Bourbon.&nbsp; I listened to a&nbsp; live street jazz band (!) and had po-boys and gumbo and umm... It was a great trip, very fulfilling, spiritual, and fun. &nbsp; Unfortunately, I've been feeling very sick recently, but I think it's just due to the change of diet from home to Cajun and camp food.&nbsp; I'll post later, when I feel better.

      I've often been angered and ashamed by the Vatican's statements and positions on politics over the years.  Its ideas about the War on Terror and Iraq, and socialized medicine, I think, are rather twisted into being "Christian."  But when I read about its  urlLink recent statements about Israel and anti-semitism , I'm rather encouraged that the Church was able to take this brave stance, and call evil as they (and I) see it.  Bravo, your eminencies.  P.S.  I'm going on a weeklong service trip to Nawlins with Catholic Heart WorkCamp (w00t!) so I will be out of touch.  Feel free to comment though; I'll eargely be awaiting some responses when I get home.

      I just finished, and was totally blown away by,  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn  by Betty Smith.  Never once has a book made me smile so often, and so sympthaize and empathize with the protagonist.  Each character is so developed and so really human that they enter the people of the reader's everyday life.  If, like me, your education never required this book as reading, I cannot recommend it enough.

      I know I'm young, but I've been doing a lot of thinking about my future lately, careerly speaking.  I always thought I wanted to be a politcian, but then I just started thinking about how slimy and virtueless most of them are.  And then the thought struck me: what about becoming a pundit?  Yes, one of those big famous ones on TV!  It would tie together my interests in politics, writing, and public speaking (and acting, I admit), while sparing my integrity.  Pretty soon I'll have to choose a college and my major (which I know aren't written in stone, but...), so any advice you can give on career paths and a young conservative's future would be appreciated.  P.S.  Another way to help would be to spread word of this blog to other folks, I love spreading ideas.  Anyone know how I can get linked to larger blogs?   Thankys.

      I just read  urlLink this story,  and GOD it makes me sick.  Okay, so doctors mess up, but this just goes  way  beyond malpractice, besides being further wrong in my mind with my pro-life views.  Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.  The French are useless.

      Apparently, there's been some confusion as to who "Iggy" and "Will" are, as the posts are signed Iggy bust posted by Will.  Now hear this: Iggy and Will are one and the same.  To avoid teary-eyed aggravation among my readers, I'll do my best to just refer to myself as Will from now on.  But no promises.

      Ah, summer.  I like it, but then again I like all the seasons.  There's something special about each one.  However, I always do miss my school, liberal as it is.  My friends, the beauty of the building itself (2nd Empire Fench style, 1870 fd.).  And I'm especially looking forward to going back to school this fall, as it's an election year  and  I'll be in a comparative politics class.  I can't wait to ruffle some feathers with 'Bush-Cheney' stickers all over my books and folders, etc.  Ahhh, the glory of conservatism.  Little amuses me more than inflamed, blustering liberals screaming "fascist!" at me will I sit smugly, arms crossed....  Lovely.

      Hey guys.  Sorry it's been a while.  And quite a while.  But with summer in full swing and my routine down, I hope I'll be able to post more often nowadays.  I've been reading a lot about the good news from Iraq's rebuilding, etc., and really hope that their teams do well in the Olympics this year.  It would be a great national morale booster, and hell, if the US ends up playing them in something, I'll probably root for the Raqis.  I'm at work right now so I can't post long, but I'll be back later.  Iggy out.
