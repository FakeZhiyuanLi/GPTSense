      Gyaa...It's almost 5:00 and I'm tired. I've been wandering around town with Lizzie, trying to find the market...but I'll get to that later.  Anyway, news flash: According to El Padre, I'm going to be doing most (if not all) of the textual input for this blog. This reduces it from "The McDaniels (and Arendales) Do San Miguel" to "Meagan Does San Miguel with Possibly the Occassional Piece of Commentary from Dad, Except He's Probably Too Lazy to Do Anything but Upload the Zillion Pictures He's Taking, and Even Then, I'll Probably Have to Teach Him How to Do That."   Oy.  But ah well. It's Mexico! Who really cares, eh? 'Sides, you don't mind hearing only one side of the story, do ya? Do ya? Well, you'd better not, so there.  Aaaaanyway...Might as well tell you about getting here, cuz that's a whole story in and of itself.   ---  THE McDANIELS GET TO SAN MIGUEL  Well, the first thing that happened was that it took us forever to get packed up and piled in the car. No surprise there. But we'd left the car doors open in the driveway for so long while we were loading our luggage that the battery died, so we had to use Dad's car to jump-start it. Yeesh.  We drove to Port Mansfield (sorry if I spelled that wrong) that day and chilled out. I called my folks and my best friend Becky, munched on peanuts, and watched Nick at Nite on the big ol' TV they had in the lounge at the Mansfield Club. Lesse, couple of episodes of  The Andy Griffith Show , couple more of  The Addams Family , and my first two viewings of  Green Acres . Yes, I had never seen  Green Acres  prior to that. Makes you worry about the world, doesn't it?  So Dad decided that we should go out and see the deer feed, which I didn't particularly care about, since I've seen more deer up-close to satisfy me a lifetime. But me, Dad, Laura, and Lizzie drove out anyway. It was too early, so we didn't see any, 'cept a couple. But we did see three turkeys, and a cat, and heard some bob-white quail. Turkeys! Whoo!  Back to the Club to eat. Had fish that the Arendales caught; was very good despite being bright green. I think they used green spices on it or something...*shrug* Dunno. But then we just went to bed and got up at six the next day to start driving. That was yesterday.  Yesterday was...ooh, bleck. Twelve hours in a car! Well, first we drove across the border, but the place where we were supposed to register the car had no electricity. So we drove around the border of Mexico and found another place, but we didn't have the title of the car. (Don't ask; I don't know. Some paper.) We parked, and Dad and Ben took a taxi back to the States to see if they could get the title faxed to them in a hotel. We could've taken the car back across, but the U.S. customs people prolly would've confiscated all the wine and beef we'd brought. *cough*You didn't read that.*cough* Yeah. So Laura, Lizzie, and I chilled out (metaphorically speaking; it was hot) in the suburban. Laura called her mom in Houston, who went to the house to get the title to try and fax to Dad as soon as his taxi got over the border and he found a place with a working fax machine. (Whew!) Mrs. Morton (sorry if I spelled that wrong too) couldn't work the fax machine, but fortunately Elliot showed up at the house and did it. And while all that was going on, Laura went to go exchange our American money for pesos. Finally, Dad n' Ben came back with like six copies of the Holy Title, and the cab driver that had gotten them through it all led us to the vehicle registration place. All went well there, and we paid the cabbie like $100 (American equivalent). Juan was one happy Mexican, I'm sure.  All told, we lost about three hours' time, and were really lucky that things turned out as well as they did. I didn't have a real problem with any of the delay...I was in the parked car the whole time and just sat and wrote. (Journal power! W00T!) We drove straight to San Luis Podaci (yeah, definitely spelled that one wrong) except for one stop for gasoline, which was like seven hours. We kinda got lost in San Luis, but we again paid a cabby to show us the way and made it to the Westin Hotel unscathed. (There were some close calls, though. Fortunately, Laura's an aggresive driver. Or maybe BECAUSE Laura's an aggresive driver...)   The Arendales, who didn't have all the mess at the border to contend with, had gone ahead, and we assumed they'd be two or three hours ahead of us. But as it turned out, they got lost at every turn, and showed up at Westin a mere fifteen minutes before we did. Har. Made ME feel better about it, anyway...  Westin was a really nice hotel, to put it mildly. Four-star for sure. We all ate dinner (the only real meal of the day) and crashed pretty early. Actually, Ben and I stayed up for a couple of hours watching TV...It was pretty cool. I saw  Invader Zim  for the first time ever, but it was in Spanish, so I'm not sure I quite caught the plot. One thing's for sure, though...Mexican Gir RULES!  But we finally went to bed around midnight or one or something. (There wasn't a clock in our room...strange.) Up at seven, breakfast at the hotel, and then it was back in the car for the last two hours of the trip.  Nothing unusual to report about getting into San Miguel. Saw lots of sheep, if that counts for anything...and those low stone walls that farmers used to fence in their livestock hundreds of years ago. Lots of those.   Skipping the part about getting here and picking out who was sleeping in what room and all that. Maybe when I have more energy I'll describe the house in Awesome Fiction-Novel-Esque Detail, but I just wanna finish this entry right now so I can nap or swim or something. Maybe nap in the pool...*yawn* Suffice it to say that my first reaction upon entering this house was, "I died. I fell over and died and now I'm in heaven." Seriously. It's THAT awesome.  Since we were all hungry from the moving and the driving, we went out to eat at Mama Mia's, the best bar in San Miguel. We had food, of course, not just alcohol.  Las quesadillas son deliciosas!  Then Lizzie wanted to go to the market, but Dad n' Laura didn't want her wandering around by herself, so I had to go with her. I didn't mind THAT much...I acted like I did, but it was nice to see the town again. And I found the Petit Four, my Swedish patry shop that I walked to every morning for breakfast. Score! ;-)   [We interrupt this blogpost to mess around on mIRC.  ...  ...  ...  We now return you to our regularly scheduled blog.]  But mostly it was just us wandering around lost until we finally called a taxi to take us to the market. By the time Lizzie was done looking around, we were both unwilling to walk home, so we took...yes...a taxi.   What is our address, anyway? 62 something that starts with a B. I wanna say Barrios, but I know for a fact that that's not right. Oh well. I'll figure out where I live later.  Maybe this wasn't enough of a post, but oh well. I'm still tired, and now it's almost 6:00. Yes, this took me an hour. I'm slow, OK?

      First let me explain this is my first ever web-log or blog experience.  I am not a very accurate or fast typer so any post of mine will not be of the length and quality of daughter number one.  Here we go…..  My thoughts on why I love San Miguel.     ·	The weather .. it’s as close to perfect as any place I’ve ever been.  Yesterday was typical, a bright clear day with a high temperature of 82 degrees and very low humidity.  Last night it got down to a cool 55 degrees absolutely perfect for sleeping with the windows open.    ·	Waking up at sunrise…. Well Listening to San Miguel awake at sunrise is more appropriate.  The random ringing of a church bell off in the distance, the song of the birds as they greet the day, a far off rooster cry, the work truck as it clanks down the cobblestone street,  the tinkling of our fountains as the water responds to gravity’s pull, the peaceful glow of the sun as it illuminates my bedroom through our skylight….. Heaven help me I do love it so.  ·	The freedom this place affords my children.  They get to experience childhood as I did for a short time.  There is virtually no crime, so they are free to leave and wander about all day long without any worries.  At night a curfew is all that is required, no need to document their every move.  What have we done to America?   With all our wealth and affluence, perhaps the truly important qualities of life are missing.  ·	A maid, cook, pool man, and gardener, did I mention our own personal cook……..nuff said.  ·	Doing nothing or doing one small thing at a time.  I cannot accurately describe how the pace of life here is soooooooooooooo much slower than at home but it really does re-charge my sole.  ·	Spending time with my kids.   We are forced to be more involved in each other’s lives here in Mexico.  There are not the distractions of home that pull everyone in a different direction.  A game of rummy-cube replaces TV, a day trip to the hot springs with the kids instead of golf for me, the entire family sitting and talking and watching the sunset together.  The elusive “quality time” is found here everyday.  Well now you know why I are an engineer and not a novelist.  That is all for now I’ll try to post again latter.  PS.. I cannot get my E-mail to work, I can receive them but it won’t let me send them.  I am off to the computer store today to see if it can be fixed.

      Alright...I know a lot of y'all out there that Dad gave this address to are "blog-challenged," so I'm going to point out a feature. See at the bottom of every post where it says "# Comments"? (It'll probably say 0 on whatever you're looking at.) If you click on that, you'll be taken to a page that has just that one post on it. On that page will be a link saying, "Post a comment." Clicking on those words opens up a box where you can leave comments about what you just read. It's pretty swanky, and you should try it if you wanna voice your thoughts or just drop us a line down here. Go on, I dare you. =)

      I'm sorry for not posting yesterday.  ...  ...  ...No I'm not. I didn't post yesterday and I couldn't care less. Deal with it.  Anywho, better get y'all up to speed. The Arendales' oldest daughter Katy was supposed to fly in yesterday, but she got there "late" (an hour before her flight) and they gave her seat away. But she got to fly first class today, so that's good.   Lesse, what did I do yesterday?...Taught Dad how to upload pictures with  urlLink Hello  from Picasa, so he's been having fun posting pictures. All day I pretty much just hung out in various outdoorsy places and edited the manuscript of a fanfic I'm writing. Tanning and editing at once...I  can  multitask!   urlLink SHAMELESS PLUG SHAMELESS PLUG   Sorry; had to do that...  But I did go swimming at one point, with Lizzie n' Ben n' Avery. OK, I know I definitely spelled Avery wrong...Hey, her stuff's right over there. Lemme see if she's got her name on any of it.  *goes through Avery's stuff*  Ah-ha. It IS Avery! Score one for me!  We had green enchiladas for lunch yesterday, which is worth mentioning because they're So Freakin' Good. A wee bit spicy, but hey, I like spicy. I ate three. ;-) I think that was before I went swimming...but I don't remember. Who cares? There's no schedule here.  Dad's been trying to get everyone set up for their classes and whatnot. He's got Ben all scheduled for guitar lessons, but Lizzie and I are still in the dark. I'm trying to get into a private creative writing session (whoo, big surprise there) and Lizzie wants to do jewelrymaking or something. She's only gonna be here till Wednesday...huge bummer. :-(  Dad also decided that we're going to have "Christmas in July"...or, as he calls it,  "Feliz Navidad en Julio."  Notice that he always says  feliz  Navidad, so it's actually "Merry Christmas in July." Again with the whole "I'm too relaxed to care" business...  Well, apparently, it works like this: Tonight, or sometime soon, we each draw an envelope that contains a small amount of money and a person's name. We use the money to buy the person a gift, wrap 'em all up, and have 'Christmas' on the sixth. Hey, it works for me. (Note: For whoever gets me, I appreciate gifts that I can eat.) I have no idea what I'll buy no matter who I pick, but that's alright. The market's got lotsa variety.  What else? Hm...Oh, yes. Last night around eight-thirty or nine, Alafair (that is how you pronounce it; PLEASE don't ask me how to spell it) and Ben were going out to Charrock (spelling?...), a bar down near the Jardin. They invited me to go, because...well, I don't know. But we went, and I sat around on the third floor with all of the crazy drunk college people, listening to Pink Floyd and trying not to look bored. I did try a sip of beer, since it was two-for-one night on everything, and I actually liked it. But because I liked it, I didn't drink any more. Does that make sense? Not really, but there you go.  So the college folks drank and were stupid and drank and got stupider, and I watched the lightning off in the distance and the fireworks that someone shot off at one point. Our "group" was a dozen people at four of those little round tables set down in a row, and they christened one the  Isla de las Cervezas:  the Island of Beer. Every time someone emptied a bottle, it would be "dubbed" as a famous person and placed in the appropriate geographic location on the island. I couldn't possibly remember them all, but they included: Dave Letterman, Robert E. Lee, George Bush Sr., Michael Jackson, Fidel Castro, Jim Morris, Howard Taft, Chewbaca (the big hairy brown thing [Wookie] from  Star Wars ), Napoleon, and (the one I named even though I didn't actually drink the beer) Elvis Presley.  But for me, the evening was really boring. People just drank and smoked and talked politics that were way over my head, and all the smoke gave me a headache. I did get beer spilled all over my leather sandals, but I didn't really care; I've had experience with leather sandals and they can take serious liquid damage. But I decided to leave at ten because I was just bored...and had that headache. Ben escorted me home, and I went up on the roof and hung out with Laura and Lyda (Lida? Laida? Lie-Dah?) for awhile before going to bed. And that was yesterday.  Today! Woke up, ate breakfast with  la familia , showered, met Katy when she showed up, and edited part of some legal thing for Mr. Arendale. I have to finish editing that, actually...it's open down here on my menu. He gave me my first-ever editing advance of 50 pesos. Additionally, Mrs. Arendale promised me last night that she would throw me my first bookstore signing party whenever I put out my first novel. Add that to the fact that I'm slated to get in touch with a couple of people's friends and relatives who are writers/majoring in creative writing, and you might as well just give me my Pulitzer Prize right now and call it a day.   I'm joking, of course, but this is the first time I've ever been taken seriously with this whole writing thing. I like it. *basks in all the glorious head-inflating compliments*   But enough about me--let's talk about San Miguel! I think I summarized it best when talking to Jessica online last night, so I'll be even more egotistical and quote myself. She asked, "So what's it like down there?" and this is the only way to answer that:   "Freakin' awesome. Weather's perfect, house is gorgeous, food is excellent, schedule is nonexistent, everything's cheap and you're 21 whenever you want to be."   Seriously. This place is the best thing to ever happen to me. I feel like a different person here; it's home and better than home because I'm actually happy and content. I'd just chalk it up to the fact that here, your biggest concern is trying to decide which of the numerous beautiful places you're going to relax...but there's something else, too. I don't know. The atmosphere, I guess. I know for a fact that I never would've even considered going out to a bar in Lake Jackson or Houston, not because I'm morally opposed to it, but because I just didn't have the self-confidence. And while I didn't have a 'good time' last night, I didn't have a bad time, either, and I'm glad I went. It was interesting. And I got B33R!  I can't put my finger on what I'm trying to say. I just...Here, I'm so much closer to being the person I've always seen inside myself than I've ever been before. It's like my soul is being rejuvenated just as much as my body. (Which I am trying to tan, by the way. I mean, it probably won't do much, but as long as you can't see every single vein that's even vaguely near the surface of my skin. I'm creepy-crazy-pasty-white, and I don't like it.)  But seriously. This place is...awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. And I think I'm gonna stop now, cuz I do have to finish editing Bruce's thingamabobber, and then I'm gonna keep editing that manuscript I mentioned. And then I'm gonna...Aww, heck, who knows or cares? You don't make  plans  here.   End of Post...

      Thank God for diarrhea medicine.  ANYWAY, things are still going great here. Yesterday was the Fourth of July, so we all went to this big ol' fancy-shmancy party...'cept for Alafair, cuz she got sick. Bum. But me n' Lizzie were so bored that we walked home after an hour and chilled with Alafair, watchin'  Independence Day . If you wanna hear about the party, tell Dad or someone to post. All I'll say is that the hamburgers were the only good part.  Anyway, on to more important things...like...um...today! We had  huevos rancheros  for breakfast, which is basically a fried egg on a tortilla slathered in picante sauce. (Yum!) I got/have  tourista , the diarrhea that tourists often get from the unfamiliar microbes down here, but then I took some medicine and have been pretty OK all day. We went to the market to do our Christmas shopping, and since I'm totally inadequate at picking out gifts, Laura helped me. My person and the gifts they're getting from me are--  *A motorcycle speeds down the street, drowning out all sound.*  --pesos. Neat, huh? I just need to wrap 'em all now. Gotta find a box to put 'em in...  Oh! At the market yesterday, I bought the COOLEST paperweight. I don't know if it's supposed to be one, but I love it. I should've taken a picture of it to upload, but I didn't. It's pretty much just a big hunk of glass that's been dyed green and cut like a gemstone, but I love it. It's maybe half the size of my fist and has all these pretty inclusions and bubbles inside of it. Reminds me of the "sunstones" from those  Dinotopia  books I read as a kid. SHINY THINGS RULE!  What else? Well, there's not a lot to say about what I've been up to...just working on my website. I love doing it; I can't explain why. It's just so rewarding to see myself build something from scratch without anybody's help. I dunno what the rest of the family's been up to...Ben had his first guitar lesson today, I know that much. And...um...Well, I don't keep up with everybody. Sorry.  Other people should post on this thing. Really...This has gotta be boring for everybody who's NOT interested in  me . *decides to poke the others and see if someone else will do at least one entry* I'll tell you all about Christmas tomorrow, at least. Today's Christmas Eve...how very strange.

      The Fourth of July  Meagan wants someone else to post so I’m going to try.  I really like our real time scrap book of our trip to SMdA.  Well here I am in Mexico on the day we celebrate the birth of our nation.  Being in this country with all its boundless natural attributes and its “third world status vies a vi the States, you really appreciate what our founding fathers accomplished.  We hold these truths to be self evident………. Those words on a piece of paper and their successful application and defense through the years is the key differences in these two countries.  Thomas Jefferson is arguably the second most influential person in history, in my humble opinion.  July 6th Navidad  July 6th aka Christmas day.  We are giving present to each other and having Christmas dinner tonight,  Bruce is going to grill a beef tender we brought from the states.  This morning for breakfast the cook found my field peas I brought for a southern dinner and made refried beans out of them they were really delicious.  Yum Yum!  We don’t have a Christmas tree so we are stacking the presents around our Christmas bongos. There is a Tuesday market today that Laura and Ben and Lizzie are going to.  Bruce wants some local honey from the market so he may go or get someone to buy him some.  I think I might go out and try the local 9 hole golf course.  Yesterday I talked to Ben’s guitar teacher who is also a painter.  He used to be a street musician in New Orleans and is a singer songwriter.  He is agreeable to doing a rooftop house concert so we are going to try and set that up for the night of the 21st.  The computer guy came yesterday and fixed my e-mail woop!

      Christmas July 7, 2004  Well last night we had Christmas in July, and the McDaniel and Arendale families exchanged gifts.  Lida and Laura cooked a great dinner of grilled beef tender, scalloped potatoes, fresh snap green beans, and a salad.  Our appetizer was cream cheese with raspberry jelly loaded with pecans and a jalapeño pepper on a ritz cracker.  We also had French bread and a to die for cheese cake with strawberries.  Yum Yum.  Katie read a bible verse before we exchanged gifts and the gift exchange was very sentimental, everyone took a lot of time figuring out what their person would like and buying that.  Lida cried when Lizzie gave her the gift she had purchased for her, it was a really neat moment.  Meagan drew my name and bought me a set of hand carved wood dominoes (destined for the hunting camp), a Limon cello glass, a SMdA shot glass and atop you spin for some type of Mexican drinking game (I’ll probably give that to one of the college kids).   Everyone was in agreement that they received great gifts; I’ll try to post some pictures when the internet is fixed.   Alafair is still under the weather so Lida called and had a Doctor come visit, a house call pretty cool huh.  Also yesterday Lida scraped her suburban on a beer truck turning the corner too tight on these narrow roads. We took Lizzie to the airport at noon and she made it home just fine, we also picked up Taylor White Ben’s friend who is visiting for a week.  I played golf yesterday and met some nice retirees at the course.  Ollie is 88 and has a live in girlfriend; he doesn’t act or look 88.  It’s raining and hailing outside right now.  It will be gone in an hour and the sun will return.  The internet has been down for 24 hours and we don’t know when it will be fixed, I’ll post this as soon as I’m able.    Bruce and I may play golf tomorrow.  Friday we are going to visit the glass factory that should be a lot of fun.  Friday we also have lunch at the Walkers house and are going out to dinner with Tommy Kimball.  Bruce is trying to wrap up one last case so he can stay the entire month without going home.  He had one case settle already so maybe it will work out.  Alafair came downstairs 30 minutes after the Doctor left feeling good, a miracle drug has been applied, the whole house rejoices, it’s so great to have Alafair back amongst the living.    We went out to dinner last night at Tio Lucas and had a wonderful time.  The Caesar salad prepared tableside was to die for.  The guacamole was also out of this world.  Ben and Taylor escorted Katie after dinner as they went dancing.

      The Internet was down for a day or so, so that's why I didn't post on "Christmas" like I said I would. At least Dad did...this morning, I guess. Jeez, all his posts are so deep and meaningful. This is a vacation! That means you're supposed to vacate your brain. And for me, that rules out all deep, meaningful thought.  *spaces out for a couple of minutes*  *snaps out of it*  Eh? Oh, right, right, the blog. Anyway, Christmas. Alafair couldn't come down and party with us, because she was sick. She still is, but it's not as bad; I think she went out to the barn with Avery n' them today. But she had to stay upstairs while we ate Christmas dinner. Let me try to remember what it was...  1) Really good legumes of some kind. 2) Scalloped potatoes with...something...cream cheese? 3) Beef, which I didn't eat much of, for I am not a beef fan. Not that it was bad. Bruce cooked it on the rooftop grill and everything. 4) A salad that Lida made. I don't remember what was in it, but it was good. 5) Cheesecake. I don't like cheesecake, so I didn't eat any, but everyone else seemed to enjoy it a lot. So I guess it was good.  We had to "dress up" for dinner, which for me was just some nice pants and a collared zip-up shirt. Dad blessed the food, we ate it, and then we moved into the second living room for gift-giving. Avery had the video camera, Dad had the digital camera, and Lizzie had the basket with everyone's names in it. We'd elected Katy a few days ago to read a Scripture passage, and I wish I could remember which one it was, but I can't. It's from one of the Corinthians or something...It was the "love is patient, love is kind"...etc..."and the greatest of these is love," one. 'Twas nifty.  Then we had the gift-giving. Lizzie would draw a name, and that person would get the gift they got for their person and give it to...well, their person.  Uhh...that's confusing. Lemme try that again.  Lizzie drew herself first, so she gave her presents to Lida. Got it? Yeah...So we just did that until everybody got their presents. I'm not going to list them all, because I'm lazy like that, but Bruce got Laura a wooden cross, and Katy got me some lil' jewelry items and such, and Laura got ben a cologne bottle that looked like a silver Cuban cigar case. And other stuff. Most people got more than one present, since we each had 200 pesos (roughly $20) to spend. The only thing we didn't do was let Ben give Alafair her present, because she was sick. As soon as it was all over, me n' Avery went to bed, because that's what we do. I'm glad we're roommates, cuz we both hate staying up and out and all of that.  OK, that was Christmas. (Ben gave Alafair her present the next morning.) We still haven't taken down the tinsel, I think, at least not the tinsel on the bongos. Hee-hee...Christmas bongos...That's very cool.  But now we move on to yesterday, which was when Ben gave Alafair her present. After that, Dad told me yet again that I needed to get out of the house and do something...because...I've just been hanging out here the whole time. Normally, the idea of leaving would bother me, because I'd be working on my website or something...But I had to e-mail one  urlLink Laurel Edwards  about the name of my site (don't ask; too long of a story) so until I get her reply, I'm halting all construction. This left me with nothing to do yesterday but edit my fanfic manuscript. And since Dad said I  had  to go somewhere...  There's a Swedish pastry shop waaaaaay downtown on the end of Mesones street called The Petit Four. It's connected to a cafe called Pancho and Lefty's; I think Dad uploaded a picture of the interior awhile back. Two years ago, I found The Petit Four and journeyed there every morning for a snack (no easy feat, mind you). I figured that sitting in tiny pastry shop in Mexico munching on a handmade treat and editing the manuscript of a story was just about the most writerly thing I could do, so...I did.   Dad lent me one of his old leather computer cases for this trip so my laptop wouldn't get banged up on the car ride down here. It has this one pocket that's the perfect size for my manuscript, so I put that in there and my red "Second Edit" pen. Then I figured that it would be silly for me to carry that thing all the way down there if all that was in it was thirty-five pieces of paper and a pen, so I threw in my journals and every pen, pencil, and highlighter that I brought. Satisfied with all of my useless baggage, I followed Laura down to the market; we parted ways at what I call the "fake Jardin" and I walked down to The Petit Four. This was around...hm, I'd say three o'clock.  So I got there, picked a table, settled down, and bought myself a fruit cup. It's a bunch of fruit in gelatin in this...cookie-ish cup thing. There was canteloupe, kiwi, strawberry, blueberry, apple, orange, pineapple, and other yumminess. So I ate that, then whipped out my Manuscript o' Doom and edited. I wanted to get all the secondary editing done three days before I left so I could have time to key in all the changes, and in order to do that, I calculated that I'd need to get all the way to page 48. That way I'd only have to do two pages a day until it was time to key in. So I edited and edited...and edited...and got to page 48...and turned around...and it was pouring down rain outside.  Now, I must explain that when you're occupied with reading, or writing, or editing, or anything of that nature, sudden and dramatic changes in the weather do not come to your attention. I watched the street turn into a river before shrugging nonchalantly, because if I know nothing else, it is this: If you are going to be trapped by heavy rainfall somewhere in the middle of Mexico, a quaint Swedish pastry shop is a freakin' good place to get trapped.  "Hmm, looks like I'm stuck here. At least I have my manuscript, and money. I don't wanna spend any more, though, since I already bought a...Ooh! 100 grams of miniature nut-and-chocolate-chip cookies for two and a half bucks? SW33T!"  So I just edited some more and waited for the rain to let up. Around page 52, I got to wondering how long I'd been out, so I decided to go home anyway. It wasn't raining any more, really; the streets were just flooded. So I packed up and headed out, trudging along the sidewalks (where available) and through the ankle-deep water where I had to cross intersections. Fortunately, I was wearing shorts and leather sandals, so I didn't damage anything. (Trust me, dude - leather sandals can take huge amounts of liquid abuse. Said it before, sayin' it now, and will probably say it again.)  Well, when I reached the "fake Jardin," I decided to take a cab, because I wasn't entirely sure of the way back. Then I had to figure out the front door, which took a moment, since you turn the key counterclockwise to unlock. But I finally got in, and it was a quarter till six. And that was my adventure for yesterday.  We went out to eat last night, but I'm absolutely starving right now, so I'm not going to tell you about it. I've taken to not eating breakfast, not only because I usually sleep through it (it's around 8:00) but because my  tourista  acts up the worst in the morning. But now it's 1:34, time for lunch, and I'M HUNGRY. So I think I'll go downstairs and see when lunch is supposed to be, and probably eat, and do more editing. I've discovered the power of sunscreen, so the roof is no longer dangerous. (I've been up there every day and have burned myself because of it.) So I'll see you folks around.   Adios, amigos!   P.S. I'm gonna call Mom today to see if I can stay an extra week, past the 23rd. I mean, why am I leaving on the 23rd? Originally it was cuz Kristin had something to go to, not me. So why the heck do  I  have to leave a week early? I REFUSE! I'M STAYING HERE FOREVER!!!  You: But Meagan - don't you miss your family, and Lake Jackson?  ...  ...  ...  *falls over laughing hysterically*  That's a good one, reader. That's a real good one.

      Have to post because I haven't done so in awhile, but I've been dragged around Dolores Hidalgo all day, so I'm tired and want to do leisure things. This'll be quick.  I can't remember when I last posted, so you'll just have to settle for what went down today. Around noon, we (the Arendales, the McDaniels, and Ben's friend Taylor) drove out to a town called Dolores Hidalgo to shop for pottery, or something. We had this really good meat at a restaurant there first thing off. I want to call it barbecue, but there was no barbecue sauce...it was more like tacos. And gorditas. And guacamole. And stuff.  After eating, we tromped around and looked at a bunch of pottery and antiques and churches. None of it was particularly interesting to me, so I'm not going to describe it. If you want that, make somebody else post, cuz you're getting one side of the story here whether you like it or not.  Actually, I will mention the ice cream, cuz it was good. There was this little stand outside one of the churches selling homemade ice cream, and...uh, well, it was really good. That's all there is to say about it. I got the "Vanilla Special"...it was like butter pecan with a hint of cinnamon. Very rich.  So after the ice cream, we headed out to some church in the middle of nowhere because it's one of the top ten restoration projects on Earth, or something like that. It started with an A, but I can't spell it...Atonta-somethin'. There was a cat chillin' in the altar, which was kind of funny, but that covers it. But it took us forever to actually get to the place because Lida n' Laura n' Katy n' Alafair (n' Taylor) wanted to look at antiques and stuff on the side of the road. I will never, ever see the virtue in antiques, but hey, we can't all be perfect.   We finally got home like forty minutes ago, but I've just now been able to get online. And I've got other things to do, so I'll see you folks later. Maybe Dad'll upload some pictures for you or something.  Adios.   P.S. Sorry if this post sounded grumpy; I just didn't get anything out of today. I wasn't miserable or anything, but I wasn't even told we were going anywhere until less than an hour before we left, and nothing about today was worth the trip.  Except maybe the food.  And the ice cream...

      Dad says people keep griping that there's no textual updates on this blog. Well, I'm on vacation - you know, that thing where you relax and don't do stuff like this? - but I guess I'll post anyway to keep you happy.  &nbsp; Lesse...We've gone on several excursions the past few days, though "we" is usually two adults and three kids. Dad, Bruce, Ben, Taylor, and I sought out some Mayan (Aztec? Inca?) ruins, but never found them, instead taking a four-hour detour through the middle of nowhere and seeing some interesting things. A dam in a canyon, a hole-in-the-wall village with chickens running through the yards, and a beautiful church in a town of a hundred people were a few of the things we stumbled across. Yesterday, the Arendales (sans Katy; she left for a few days) and I went to a market on the other side of town, just to check out what it was like, but it was mostly produce and clothes. And several days ago, we all went to this gorgeous ranch where some millionaire's going to build a golf course. Personally, I liked it the way it was. Actually, we were supposed to go to a glass factory, but we got there like half an hour late and missed our tour. So we went to the ranch instead.  &nbsp; Now what? Um...Taylor left yesterday. Katy's coming back...er, soon. Tomorrow, or something. Lizzie's been at camp for a week, or a bit more.  &nbsp; As far as what everybody's up to...well, I can't tell you for sure. Alafair and Bruce are taking a sculpting class; both are making fish of some sort. Avery rides horses every morning. Dad does whatever Dad does. Laura and Lida go shopping. Ben hangs out with a bunch of girls he's found. And I...Well, if we're not doing something interesting, I'm in my room, writing HTML code or some such nonsense. I brought my computer up onto the roof one day to work, but the glare was such that I could hardly see the screen. Don't get me wrong; I love being in Mexico, but web design is just so much  fun!  Seriously! Who would've thought it, eh? &nbsp; At any rate, I can't believe our time here is halfway spent. That's insane. I feel like I live here. &nbsp; Okay, I  do , but not literally. However, if home is where your heart is, then I do indeed live here year-round. It's just so...so....Not  perfect  (no place is), but so  close  to perfect. You know? No big-city pollution or shopping malls or glitz or glamor or stress anything like that. Just...life, diluted to its purest form. Again, it's not perfect (for one thing, the Internet connection is really spazzy) but hey, it's close enough for me.  &nbsp; Okay, that's enough. I'm off to gather manipulable graphics to mess with in PaintShop Pro 8. See ya.

      Well I guess I’ll try and give an update on what’s been going on.&nbsp; First, we eat like Kings, the cook prepares breakfast and lunch everyday.&nbsp; A typical breakfast is fruit (papaya, strawberry, pineapple, banana)&nbsp; Huevos rancheros, bacon, toast, fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee.&nbsp; Lunch the other day was poblano chilies stuffed with spicy meat, grilled Portobello mushroom caps stuffed with spinach, and a tossed salad.&nbsp; At night we eat out at the excellent restaurants all over town.&nbsp; We typically walked to dinner via the Jardin to see what is going on there.&nbsp; The entire social life of San Miguel centers around the Jardin or town square.&nbsp; After dinner it is back to the Jardin to see what is happening.&nbsp; The other night I hired a Mariachi band to serenade Laura and me.&nbsp; She was kind of embarrassed but she got over &nbsp;it and really enjoyed it I think.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We have taken some driving day trips out into the country that have been a lot of fun.&nbsp; The kids especially have enjoyed seeing the peasants toiling in the fields.&nbsp; I hope it will help them appreciate how good they have it.&nbsp; Meagan is completely absorbed with HTML programming.&nbsp; She has taught herself computer code and is building her own website from scratch.&nbsp; I have to insist she gets out and goes sightseeing with me at least once a day or she would never leave the computer. &nbsp;&nbsp;Ben is girl crazy.&nbsp; He met three girls from San Antonio and is panting around with them, showing them way too much attention.&nbsp; We have tried to explain to him to play it cool and act like he is not that interested, but he just can’t make himself do it.&nbsp; This morning he informed me that “Women are impossible.&nbsp; They are so weird.”&nbsp; I hope he truly has learned that, because I still forget it, and assume women periodically think like me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Lately we have been getting a cooling shower for about one hour everyday at around 4:30.&nbsp; It cools it off from 80 to 72 and then quickly goes away leaving no trace of rain 30 minutes after it has stopped.&nbsp; The weather is absolutely perfect here.&nbsp; I love napping (siesta) during the rain storms.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vickery’s, some friends of ours from Houston are coming to spend a long weekend in San Miguel.&nbsp; They are arriving Thursday and going home Sunday.&nbsp; I hope they enjoy this place as much as we do.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      BAM!   Let the cheesy Emeril references begin, cuz Lida, Laura, Katy, Alafair, Avery, Patrick (Katy's boyfriend) and yours truly took A Cooking Class today! I think I was the only person besides Patrick who'd never been; everyone else had gone two years ago or four years ago or five years ago or  whatever.  There's this eccentric (but very cool) lady named Patsy who has a house outside of town and gives cooking classes, wherein you all show up for five hours and make  comida.  (That's "food," children. Study your Spanish!)   Avery woke me up early this morning so I could shower before we left - thanks, Avery. Patsy showed up at the front door at 9:45, and we took two cars out to her house, which we probably never would have found without her. She's got two houses, actually, but she rents out the old one and lives in the newer one. Neither are big, but the newer is approximately 75% kitchen, which makes it suitable for giving cooking lessons in. I suppose that was the point.   At any rate, we got there and immediately got our hands dirty, preparing to make roasted pork, tamales, Aztec pie, chips, and chocolate chip cookies. I'd never heard of Aztec pie before today, but it's pretty much thus: Take everything you'd ever want to put on a tortilla chip. Layer it. Throw some whipped cream (not the sweet kind!) on top. And that's an Aztec pie. We're talkin' beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese, and all that jazz.   So we started cooking! We did everything from shucking the corn to shredding the chicken to roasting the peppers to frying the chips to grinding the tomatoes to dicing the onions to blending the tamale paste to  feeding the chickens!  OK, it wasn't entirely relevent, but still. I got to feed the chickens!  Patsy had chickens. Lots and lots of chickens. I'd say there were forty or so. There was a pen for them, but I guess that was just for at night, cuz they ran around all over the place most of the time. They lay eggs that she cooks with, and she feeds them all the food scraps (like corncobs and stuff). I got to take the bucket out there and dump it in the pen for all the chickens to eat. Heee! Chickens! I love the chickens!   Anyway, we cooked for, like...four hours. We also went n' saw her old house, but Avery and I didn't stay long, cuz it was small and Avery had been there before. But our main entertainment (when we weren't preparing something) was flywatching.   Patsy said that flies always proliferate before it rains. Well, I suppose she was right, because there were flies all  over  her kitchen. We're talking by the dozens. They'd land on anything they could, but if there was no real food out, they'd go for the two little plates of bait she had out...It was a combination of water and Snip, the stuff you rub on horses to keep the flies off. It works really fast, and it was extremely amusing to watch the flies die. They'd land, take a sip or two, walk around--then just freeze. Usually they'd fall over dead a few seconds after that, but some put on a show. This one fly - we called him Superfly - stayed alive for a good two minutes after eating the Snip, spasming and trying to buzz away. This other guy, the Spinner, spun around  insanely  fast for the longest time before dropping dead. Like, think of how fast a fly flies...then imagine one all spazzy so that it tried to fly with one wing and just keep going in circles. That's how fast he was spinning. Bet he got dizzy.   (Look, people, you had to be there...)  Anyway, we cooked n' cooked n' watched flies die n' cooked n' cooked and  finally  all the food was ready. We ate...and ate...and sat outside and talked...and ate. And it was good.  Los tamales son muy buenos!  (Or is it  las tamales son muy buenas?  *sigh* That's the problem with Spanish - everything has sex.)   But eventually we got done eating, and packed up the rest to take home. It was great fun. Lots of work, but great fun. Besides, it's  cooking,  which is always rewarding. You get food! Who can resist food, eh? Not me, that's for sure!

      I posted today about yesterday, but since Dad put up so many pictures, you can't see it on the right. Just scroll down to find it.  Anyway, some quickie updates. I have officially read two books this entire summer! Yay! You'd think that I'd be reading constantly...and I am. It's just never  books  anymore. I'm too lazy to go out and get them ,  y'know? But Alafair had a copy of  Mrs. Dalloway  by Virginia Woolf, so I read that yesterday. And Laura was reading  Angels & Demons  by Dan Brown; I picked it up two days ago and read the first hundred pages, then finished it today.  Angels &&nbsp;Demons  is the prequel to  The Da Vinci Code,  for those who don't recognize the name. Personally, I liked&nbsp;A&D better than  Da Vinci Code ...maybe because more people die. Like, way more people. In fact...*counts*...ten, I think. There were probably more that I can't remember right now. But at least ten.   My only gripes with the book are thus:  1. It's structured  so  similarly to DVC that you'd swear you were reading it over again on occassion. All the characters seem carbon copies of the ones in the other book, except that only Robert Langdon is actually the same person. The others are stereotypes:&nbsp;sexy sidekick braniac chick whose mentor male elder relation was murdered (grandfather in DVC,&nbsp;adopted father in A&D); stern, gets-in-Langdon's-way-a-lot head-honcho military guy; crippled guy who's really important to the plot; freaky-deaky&nbsp;strongman assassin operating&nbsp;for mysterious organization who&nbsp;is obsessive-compulsively devoted to his cause and&nbsp;does all the killing/grunt work;&nbsp;etc. There's even a "follow the clues hidden in artwork to get to the secret lair of ancient underground organization" thing...except it's the Illuminati instead of the Knights Templar or Holy Grail, and statues instead of paintings. It's more of a thriller, less plausible than DVC, and thus&nbsp;more exciting...but still. A  lot  is the same.  2. What's up with Robert Langdon and younger women? I think Dan Brown's just fantasizing in both&nbsp;A&D and DVC. I mean, c'mon - sexy genius chicks are not gonna wanna hook up with a 40+ art history teacher/symbologist, even if he is from Harvard. At least Brown got better at it...DVC ends with a scene wherein Langdon and Sophie pretty much decide their relationship can't work, and there's some unexpressed sexual tension. (At least, that's what I seem to remember.) But&nbsp;A&D just ends with Langdon and Vittoria (that particular book's genius sidekick chick) shacking up. Actually, it ends with Vittoria making some stupid I-am-a-yoga-master-revel-in-my-thusly-awesome-sex-skills joke. *facepalm* So retarded. You're a little too obvious for me, Brown; Vittoria was too strong a character to fall for Robert Langdon. The guy wears a Mickey-freakin'-Mouse watch, for crying out loud!  OK, OK, enough ranting from me. Other than those two points, I advise reading  Angels & Demons.  I'll say about it what I said about  Da Vinci Code:  bad writing, good plot. Good  thriller  writing, I suppose, but as far as craft goes...bleh.   Anyway, I'm a bit red because I laid out reading for several hours and lightly toasted myself. I don't mind or anything - I did it on purpose, and I'm not uber-sunburned or peeling or anything. (Tanned! Tanned! I must get tanned!) I also wanted to go to the Petit Four today, but  Angels & Demons  ate my afternoon, so I'll just go tomorrow. Hooray for lax Mexican scheduling.   Well, that was the Books. "Bites" refers to the fact that Bruce got the tip of one of his fingers bitten off by a horse. And that's Reason #17 why I don't like horses.  Seriously, though...I don't think it's that bad, except for the fact that he lost the tip of his finger. I dunno if they saved the joint or not; he's staying the night in the hospital to make sure it doesn't get infected. It was too chewed up and gross to reattach, but hey, it could've been a lot worse. He coulda lost his whole finger or somethin'. (Will give more details when I get them. Actually, I know more than all that right now, but I'm too lazy to tell you.)  And "Boyfriends" would be Mike. No, not my dad; Alafair's boyfriend Mike. He came down today and is staying till...when? Sunday evening? Eh, I dunno. He doesn't look like I thought he would; neither does Patrick. No one ever described either of them to me, so I suppose it makes sense that they don't look like I thought they would, but still. I didn't get to say more to Mike than "hi," so I can't tell you about him. Ask Alafair. Or maybe just ask Mike. That'd work too.   *yawn* Well, I'm tired, and am going to bed. Or at least get off the blog. I shall see you at some undetermined point in the future. G'night...

      I've been instructed to do a "wrap-up" post, since today is technically our last day in San Miguel. BOO!  It doesn't feel like the last day. I don't think I'll really get it until we cross the border tomorrow. Are you sure I don't live here? Are you certain this isn't my home? Why are we going on vacation to Texas, and when are we coming back?  Seriously. I know I haven't posted on this blog much, but that's because I've been having such a great time. Man, today's the  last  day? Crazy.  We went out to dinner last night, which was cool. More significant is the fact that I was taught how to do hair and makeup. I doubt I can remember it all, so I'll ask Katie and Alafair to write all of that stuff down for me. I think Dad has some pictures of me looking all snazzy...he said he'd post one.  Oh, and I bought Becky some presents today cuz Dad made me. I'm a terrible shopper; I never know what to get people, so that's why I haven't bought gifts. But hey, at least Becky'll get something. Not telling you what it is, though. I think she reads this blog.  Had something else to say...Oh, the Arendales are off in some town for the day. Except Avery; she and I went 'shopping' together. For gifts.   Bagh! Forget this. Maybe I'll post something else later. I'm too busy  urlLink reading Sluggy Freelance  to pay this thing any heed. And I'm hungry. I think I'll go seek potatoes...
