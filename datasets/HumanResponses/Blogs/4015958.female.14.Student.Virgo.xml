						    Ok, it's saturday and still no call! Maybe his parents took away his cell phone. Ok, I need to stop making these lame excuse to make me feel more secure and feel like he still cares, when deep down I know he doesnt. I need to let this all go. When I do finally see him or at least talk to him. I'm teling him off. He deserves it. I keep thinking i'm gonna do this but I know that's wrong too. He'll probably give me some lame reasoning, say something sweet, and i'll forgive him. No! I'm not doing that. Not this time. I just need to remember he doesnt deserve me, because he doesnt. Oh, this is all just making me so angry. But i'm hessitant to talk to anyone about this because who knows if it'll make me sound like a fool. Oh, but who am I kidding, I'm acting like one. Come on, I'm just being an idiot. Well, I wish i could solve this, but I can't. I could try to start something with someone else, but what good is that gonna do? It'll make me feel good for like a second, and then i'll feel guilty about cheating on Andrew. Oh well...      ~*  D  ANIELLE   C   AILA  *~

That fits, I just wish it didnt. I dont think i should have to be the one who fixes things with Andrew. If he's gonna be like this, not caing, he doesn't deserve me. And he definittly doesnt deserve me giving up everything just to fix things with him.      I never know what i want anymore though. One day it's everything perfect with Andrew, then it's drama, then it's Kyle, and then backto Andrew.      Kyle- what another subject! Everywhere I go something reminds me of him, whether it's his basketball number or a song he mentioned once. But he's so wrong for me, right? He practically hates me now, and you know who's fault that is... MINE! I'm the stupid one that listened to my "friends" that say " Oh he's a player" or "He's never serious, maybe he's gay" It's the stupid comments like that. I'm sick of it. I've seen the other side of him, though. He can be sweet, romantic, sexy, considerate, caring, protective, fun, funny, my list goes on and on. I really like him, and we used to be like best friends. We loved each other, as friends, maybe more. But that's all done now. I'm running my own life from now on.      Andrew's out of town. I miss him, but since he's not calling me, i'm not calling him. I'm sick of doing that act. If he wants to be with me, he's gonna have to make an effort. But i'm going out of town soon, so we'll see if he calls my cell... I don't know.         Leave me comments please.
