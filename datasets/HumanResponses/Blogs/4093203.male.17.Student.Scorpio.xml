       well today jaclyn woke me up at like 9.45 by calling me.  and then i went back to bed.  so i decided to start all of this cause i get bored a lot.   i read in someones profile today that god created adam and eve not adam and steve.  well god did create steve and if adam wants steve then thats cool.  it is called equality.   so i found my kanye west cd and have been listening to it all day.  i then went and typed my letter of resignation for McD's where i was like finally, two fucking years. and next saturday i am done.    i scare myself sometimes   by the way the early november sucks ass       emo sux, punk rock
