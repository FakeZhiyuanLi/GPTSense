      well you cant have everything, that's for sure.  thursday...... i narrowly avoided being absent in surveying (though i didn't attend my first subject which is physics). as i came to the door, i saw lemons, sitting with vens. i immidiately sat beside the two, started to talk to them, and ask lemons how it went in batangas. she was obviously tired (from the travel), and told that she was feeling sick. then the great professor analyn, ooops, anaLIN came. we thought that we had it wrap, telling us that we wont be proceeding with the experiment because of the rain and some event. as we were about to celebrate, she started her long, and i mean LONG speak about her guilt trip. we spent the time listening to her, we didnt even enjoyed the early dismissal. damn!  after the class, we went out of the room. i've noticed that vens wasn't in her typical mood, for she was too quiet. i just let her be and went on with the conversation. then we crossed the room of her ex. i spaced myself from her(for obvious reasons), and went down the 3rd floor. after going to lemons locker, she was approached by her ex, along with two cohorts, man, can't he even move to her ex without bodyguards?! where was his balls? lemons noticed the company, so she asked me to go back to the lockers to get something. but i've noticed the intention, and i respect the space.  when we were at the school gate, we met vens and her ex. i can't help but notice that vens can't look me in the eye, as if saying something is bothering her. so we went out, the two went to their class, lemons got home and me and edward went to eat. the thing that lemons said bothered me althrough the day. she told me that vens was saying to me that she was going inside, but i really did not noticed that she was talking to me. but i texted her and asked if she was going to do her book. she said that she was about to go home and that she was tired. i told her that it's ok and that she takes care on her way home. but the weird is that i saw her outside the school we the cohorts of her ex. karlo told me that she saw vens look at me like she was worried, or concerned. maybe because she was about to meet her ex.............  the day ended with me, karlo, olan and mark going to the hospital. julius' father was brought there because of being over-fatigue. at around nine, karlo and me bid farewell to the other fellas.......

      wednesday.....  i attended my class in physics (should i? i mean, i should!). i was with ernie and&nbsp;we did an experiment in physics, passed the experiment, went out of school, eat, and went to national bookstore. he was searching a book about LOVE, but sadly, he didn't found what he was looking for. me, i bought myself a book by brian adams (not the singer). after that, we decided to go, doy was going home, i am heading back to school to help vens with her book.  upon arriving to school, i met constance. he told me that he saw vens with her ex. then kajo came from school also. we three decided to go to an internet shop in front of the school. i opened my friendster account, when venus texted me that she was outside the school. i replied to her that i was in the computer shop. we met at the place, and started doing her project. the two guys left, so it was vens and me. we talked while doing the project. i was suprised when my favorite song was played, entitled upsided down. i ask her if she knew who sang the song, which she answered depeche mode. i was impressed by her musical history, that i told her that she was great. we had laughs and smiles along the way.  after that, we decided to grab some bite in chowking. this time, the talk was more intimate. i opened to her, little by little who i was, as we exchanged talks and ideas. she, also opened more of herself. we talked about the past, the present, views on love, someone else's lives, etc,etc..... we had a pretty long, and i mean LONG conversation. i believe we entered the shop at around 7:45 and we left at past 10. we had i great time. especially me, 'cause i got to know her MORE. one thing's for sure, she hates cocky, boring, immature, insensitive, egoistical, typical guys, was hurt before, trust very well her bestfriend, hates the idea that a guy befriends a girl then later he'll tell that he has feelings for her, hates PDA, likes a relationship that is relax, likes simple guys, has a thing on fast cars, guitars, little cuddly things, loves radio, needs someone who'll always be there,and, before YOU forget RONIE, she is a jealous type.

      i'll cut it short.......   lemons went to batangas with her friends may and karen. we were at school before they left. i was with vens at that time, when they decided to go to the bus terminal to catch the bus headed for batangas. we fetch the three out to the school. after that i was just me and vens.   we spent the afternoon doing her thesis. at first she was shy about me helping her, but with some asking and some joking i've convinced her. i helped her with the brainstorming part. i got to know her better with this time. i even had the priviledge to fetch her to the place where she catches her ride home. before she rode the jeep, she parted me a sweet farewell. it even lingered still through my brain.

      typical day for starters, except that it gradually transformed to a very beautiful day....  the day started, naturally, with me going to class. but upon coming to my next class, which is physics, because i was so late that i didnt attend my surveying class, i was approached by iccang and venus. they told me the i was like the highest (i cant seem to remember the exact term, but i was high) on our prelim exam. at first i didn't believe them. but i got my paper, and saw my grade (20/35, thats not high? maybe because of the fact that our so-called professor is such an asshole! almost all of us classmates are pissed with her...), it was fair enough, i just cant believe that its high already. my exam in natsci was also fair, 79 (damn! sayang!).  on to the show.....  i went to a computer shop with venus and ricca, with an intention to help venus with her thesis. at first i felt that we were both slighly uncomfortable with the space we're sharing but it turn out good. so we started searching for a related literature for her thesis. then we typed some things for her proposal. as we are typing, ricca went to us, and told us that&nbsp; she had to go back to school to attend to something.....in short, its just me and venus.  after finishing typing her paper, i asked if she like to have a reading, just for fun. she eagerly said yes, and i typed the website address. i was the first to have a reading. the first thing i asked was about my future, the reading turned out to be good. we were both laughing at the reading. the second reading was also for me, which i asked about was my lovelife. the reading came and i cant believe what i read. the reading said that the past was about pain, the present was about freedom, and the future was about new beginnings. i told her that the reading was near reality (especially the future part). afterwards, she had a reading. after 2 readings, i asked her if she wants to try a personality test (i intentionally diverted the topic because she told me once that she don't believe in clairvoiance) which she again happily accepted. the was the most fun part in that interim. she discovered many things about me, and me about her. we really had fun. then ricca came from school and&nbsp;she opened her friendster account. me and venus decided that we should logout from our computer which we did. we left the computer shop went back to school. again ricca parted from us again because she will be late for her class. so venus and i went to a nearby burger stand to eat. we talked about many things. i asked her about her ex, and i told her that i saw her last week with her ex talking. she told me that it was through, and that she was weary of her ex. the only thing she wants now is to know what she has to know. i assured her that no matter what happens, i will always be there ready to help her, which, i believe is warmly accepted. she paid for my sandwich (the rare opportunities that a woman payts for me), i blushed but said thanks anyway, and i told her the next time it will be on me.  the day ended with me walking her to the place where she rides jeeps. but before she rode a jeep, we went to a grocery. i bought some snacks, she bought a plastic cover. we left the grocery, and we crossed the street. there was a jeep across the street which she rode. before she rode the jeep, she told me "ingat", which i replied with "ingat din". i really enjoyed it.

      a typical sunday for me, boring. ernie just left the house (he slept at our house because he cant let her mom see his swelling nose). i was at my mom's room when our maid told me that beverly called. i was a bit suprised because what would her purpose be to call her ex? then i went to my room, read a book and then she called again. as i said hello, she started crying, telling me that she gave my telephone number to her boyfriend because her boyfriend does'nt believe her that we didn't had sex in our relationship. fucking bastard. so i told her that i will be waiting for that bastards call. as i was waiting for him to call, i confessed the conversation to my aunt. she told me that it crossed her mind that there is a possibilty that berly only wants to make me symphatize with her. it's a possibility, no doubt, knowing berly for a long time. but she won't get anything from me. well, at least a conversation. as afternoon came, she called again, this time she was drunk. i know the style, she did it already a long time ago. but despite all that, i pity her. maybe because the fact that we've been together for 4 years. but i can honestly say that it ain't love, its just pity. pity for someone who's suffering.   i wish her the best.......

      the day started with my cronic depression, thoughts came like magma, slow, but sure. thoughts of anger, treachery, debauchery, came to my mind. i tried to ward it off, scribbling and writing about it. gladly, it subsides.   in the afternoon.....   i decided to by me a harmonica. i had this knacking to by a wind instrument, about two days ago. as i got to the mall, i went to a music shop, bought me a harmonica. it suprised me that the price of a common harmonica is just 120Php, iwas expecting like 500. after buying, i went to wendy's to eat, because my stomach is growling with hunger. after eating i went above the fourth in the arcade area to wait for ernie, when i saw edward (edward is a close friend of venus). as we converse, i was thinking if it will help me if i tell edward about my feelings with venus. he was suprised when i told him, but he told me that he was starting to notice my "moves". i was glad the he acknowledge me as a good candidate to venus. he even told me things about her, like, she is naturally shy, things like that. he also told me that vens deserves to be happy, which i will gladly give. after that talk, ernie came, with a swelling nose. so we three decide to watch a last-full show movie. we decided to watch I-ROBOT. it was a good movie. the evening had me thinking, is the&nbsp;meeting with edward fate? i hope so......

      i did'nt go to class today, because, well, i have NO class (isn't that logical?). but i had this knacking to go, and thought crossed my mind&nbsp;was venus. for some reason, i thought that this might be a bonding day for us, but i didn't manage to got up. and i just took my rest. straight through the day.... lemons texted me in the afternoon, through the computer, she is asking a favor. she asked if where i was, and if i saw vens. i told her that i'm at home, and that i will text vens for her, which i did. but venus, was at anonas (a few blocks away from school), and that she can't fetch lemons. so after texing vens, she texted me if where i was and if i can teach her with something..... which she did not say what it was. just curious.......  &nbsp;

      the day started with me waking at 4 am to review...  i woke up to review for my surveying class, i rose from bed at 4am, got my notes and started to read. i crept back at bed at about 6am. after a light sleep, i tried torose from bed at past 8 when&nbsp;i had this heavy feeling in my body...it seems that i had a fever. so i took a little rest up until 9 when i still can't get out of bed, so i decided not to go to school.  at around 1 pm, i had taken enough rest to walk around...so i decided to go to school to get the plans i borrowed from julius. after being frustrated, i decided to get myself a piece of permit for my coming exams. when i got inside the school, the first person i saw was venus and her ex....so i greeted venus, and she greeted me back. but i think something's making her sad because of the way she greeted me.   my heart ached with every step i made......  so afternoon came, i decided to go to ernest's place and that i did after i called him. i came to his place, have a little chat and we decided to buy some cd's....after going out from their house, doy told me that someone wants to talk to me. it's my ex.&nbsp; she told doy that she wants to talk to me, settle things once and for all, but she was worried to approach me (because she KNOWS me). i told doy that if&nbsp;my ex&nbsp;was sincere about her intentions, i will entertain her request. so we arrived at musicland (the pirated type), bought an usher cd and a cranberries (both the best of). around 630 pm, my mom text me if where i was, which i told her that i was in doy's place. so i went to cubao to go home with my mom.  the berly interim....  upon coming home, maricel told me that someone called.... by the name of beverly. so i went to my room, did my homeworks, and took sometime thinking about venus. i told my brother that if my ex called tell her that i am already asleep. which he did, but beverly insisted. so i entertained her call, but i did not gave her a pleasing greeting. for 2 and a half hours i made her feel the pain that i felt (which i believe is justice), and for that long, she was crying all, if not, most of the time. but the humane side of my existence overode my consiousness, and that i felt a pity, aguilt, for berly. so i finish her suffering by talking to her, not shouting, but talking. for 2 hours, we reconcilled, talked, and talked some more, like friends, who haven't met each other for a very long time.   i'm glad i got some things out of my chest, particularly pain.

      my day in school started with a meeting with venus, i asked her how she&nbsp;was and she stroked her fine hair before she looked at me with a fine glance (in which my heart melted again, as always). i saw that she was busy and left her to do her thesis. i searched for maya, a friend with a common interest in chinese language, particularly the mandarin, because i am going to give her my book on mandarin (because it pisses me off when she ask about the book, i might as well give it to her and buy another one). frustrated on seeing her, i went to the lab to see vens again. but in my dismay, she already left, and i never saw her the whole day.  as the afternoon went on, the gang decide to search for a house that is on rent. we decided to rent a house for two months to finish our projects. the first house that we saw was on illinois st, across the school. the persons who attended to us were generous enough to let us look at the unit. it was small, musty, and ventilation was poor. so we left and look on for another. on the next street we came across another house for rent. this time it was more comfortable, roomy, and the space has a room for sleeping. we ask the owner how much the rent is, and he said it'll cost 5k a month, which was a nice bargain.   the day ended with me and manong chatting the day out. we talked from the school, to the bookstore and to the restaurant.

      damn!  &nbsp; my day started so bad that i can't even get up to my bed to go to school. it's like one of those bad habits of mine when i am thinking too much..... i feel stuck to my bed and couldn't get out of it. i think what icca told me last night lingered through my conciousness. well, i had a hard time getting up to bed but i did. fixed myself up to go to school and rode an fx. upon arrival on school, the first place i went to was the lab. i met venus there and just sit there with her (because i'm so late with my subject). we chitchat, but she's too busy writing her thesis that i minimized our conversation. when i took a rest to our conversation, i noticed that her ex was on the lab also! man! why did'nt i noticed him? &nbsp; now to the sad part........ &nbsp; mae was on the opposite room of the lab, she was in a classroom. then she&nbsp;called&nbsp;me to come to her, which i gladly obliged. what pissed me off was that she ask me if i was dating RICCA in front of venus' ex. naturally the guy will think that mae is&nbsp;wrong, and&nbsp;that i will fortify his idea that i was dating her ex! shit! and i thought mae was nice..... some people are just so hyped out when they see something to talk about other people's lives.&nbsp;i don't want to think mae is like that, but based on what i've experienced, i can only say my trust&nbsp;is broken.&nbsp;she was a quiet one, which makes it more too questionable. &nbsp; but there is a lighter side on that day..... &nbsp; later that afternoon, i helped venus on her thesis, along with ricca. theni also helped ricca on her project on building laws. after that, we had our afternoon lunch outside the school and we had conversations. we parted ways after eating. ricca went with ana and mae because they&nbsp;still have classes. venus and i went on to anonas. as the walk started, we had a good conversation, particularly on friends. we discovered that we had a common friend on eugene. we were both suprised on knowing that we share a similar friend! man! this ironies and synchronicities rattle braincells! but i enjoyed it! we parted ways in front of an hospital. she was going to a computer shop, me, i was going home. i bid her farewell and told her to take care of herself in&nbsp;her way home. &nbsp; the drops of the rain is as cold as dew....... &nbsp; KEYWORD FOR THIS DAY: DISCOVERY&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      i didnt know that my crush have pains, emotional pains, that you just cant see in the surface. the ironic thing is that we suffered a somewhat similar fate. i was left in the cold when i was in design 9 by that fucking ex of mine... her? she was left in the cold also by that fucking DONIE, with no clear reason, also while taking design 9. as her friend told me, she's having a hard time dealing with it, if only i can steal her pain....  &nbsp;  i've known her history through her bestfriend, she told me the whole sad truth. another ironic thing is that we both have loved and lost twice... a beautiful face with an ugly past, mychest ache with hers. of the pain given her by some asshole...the woman that i long to be cries inside... in her own domain, her world. if only she can share her pain.... if only.  &nbsp;  please, let me give you ease, let me carry your burdens, let me take your sufferings........ &nbsp; KEYWORD FOR THIS DAY: PAIN&nbsp;

      man, i don't even know where to start!   we met early at 730 in the morning (thank GOD i'm the first one to come), then venus came with her bestfriend ricca (which i'll call LEMONS from now on..). i was eating when conversations started, venus started saying that she had a hard time sleeping in which she doesn't know the reason(if she only knew that i was thinking of her last night...). then after i ate, we rode a jeep to mrt, to go to magallanes first, then from there we'll ride a bus to alabang.   the happiness started there...   the conversations started to get personal... they asked me about my ex, venus cannot believe that my ex and i are through. she thought that we dont have problems, which i corrected. then, she started to share about HER past,(hehe, i'm so happy that i got it out of her..hehehe..)stating that she and her ex are also through, and that the reason is that her ex is not the same as he was when they were friends (maybe the guy changed in a negative way, i dunno...). so, as the trip goes on, i got some JUICY info on her, althoughout the endeveaor.   to cut it short, let's just say that we three opened up to each other...   and i got to know her better... as we were heading for the festival mall, i told them about my impressions on them.. they where amazed that i got the right impressions(basing on their facial structure). after awhile, i told them that i can also palm read. lemons, as i've told her, is melancholic, introvert, hides her pain with laughter and is emotional. venus , on the other hand, is jolly, easily swayed by problems, sensitive, and also, emotional. we had good laughs after that, and that they'd enjoyed the session(if i were to ask them for payment i'll have money right now, hehe!). then in the mall, the conversations continued, as i had dwelled further into venus' world (bwahahaha!). i have known so many essential things like her ideas, dispositions, her faith, her beliefs(she believe in karma), her relationship with her ex, et al. im glad that the both of them trusted me enough to tell me those things, generally it was a bonding day! lemons was so happy with me that she told me that i was different, in a positive way(which i really appreciated).

      yesterday night was a killer!  i came with a good friend, etienne, to their hang-out place on friday nights(but i've been there, it's just that its rare for me to go there), there, i saw a couple of my close-friends already started drinking. after a few drinks and food, crazy conversation and tons of laughs, the guys decided to bar hope to a bar a few blocks away from it.  it had a nice ambience, the people were cool and chillin, and the interior of the place as a tropical accent in it. after sitting, i ordered a choclate shake to wash the alcohol down. the guys started laughing at me, wooing me that it is "kid's stuff", so i told them to fuck off in a joking manner and we enjoyed the night away.  again, after a few rounds, the fellows decided to yet move to another joint, right besides the joint that we were in. but the different thing to the next joint is that it had an open mike, were you can sing your lungs out along with a band, a typical open mike... we ordered AGAIN, a drink. i told jules, that it would be my last round cuz i really hate catching myself drunk, it's against my system... a minute later and my friend etienne got to the mike and sang(i didnt quite heard the song though), but i really appreciate his voice. and he has the angst to go with it. so a few minutes passed by when the guys who are playing in the front showed a pair of bongos. so asked my buddies if its fine if i can borrow the bongos, which they answered yes. as soon as i got the bongos, the fellas insisted me to jam with the band. at first i was like shocked because my intentions was to bring the bongos in my seat. so, to cut it short, i played with the band using bongos with a song i don't even know!  but it was fun!

      man is my day ironic!  my day started when i'm met my friends outside the school gates, they say that they are doing something in their design(design 7 to be precise). i was just about to enter the gate when they saw me. we chatted a little outside the school, but i've notice that i was late for my physics class so i had this thinking not to attend my class. but i told to myself no, i'll be back with my bad habits if i do that. so i told the guys that i'll see them later in the day.  now this is the fun part.  after my physics class on thursdays, i have to wait like 1 1/2 hour for my next subject, surveying. i thought to myself "man, another day with that bitch!", because my prof in surveying is a headcase. i don't know what's the matter with her. but the good thing in that subject is that my crush is there too. man, did we had a good time(i sure did, hehehe!).  we were told by miss headcase (let's make her name anonymous, for anima er.. human rights protection) to proceed outside the classroom and go to the school grounds to perform one of the fieldwork in the book. so we were GLAD to oblige(yeah right...), following the master's commandments. but because of that exercise, my crush and i had a pretty long and fun conversation. theres this time that she even squeezed my forearm out of laughter(call me shallow if you like but i got it bad with this girl, no, WOMAN). after the exercise, we went on the booth of UAPSA for an application form. and after that we went to the fourth floor to look for miss h., as we were walking the conversations continued. i really concentrated in making her laugh (in which i succeed). so we got to our room, talked more, then i brought the topic to the thesis. her proposal was in Anitpolo, in which she intends to put a commercial something in there. but i suggested her to change her proposal or her site, because it is not appropriate in he site because the site is institutional, and that it would be suicide for her to continue it. so as being the natural good guy (hehehehe!), i offered her my site (which is in alabang), which she gladly took. i treasured the moment.  ...now for the SAD part.  we continued chatting, until her EX came (at least that's what we noticed). then she told me that she's going home with her EX waiting outside the room.  my heart is aching with happiness...... irony is such a word.

      these past few days, i've noticed some changes in myself.  man! i'm head over heels in this girl (but i prefer to call her a LADY! not like someone that i used to know). the way she moves, her looks, everything! i mean, i can honestly say to everyone that i have strong feelings for her (but i can't say that i love her... i'm more careful now in saying the word LOVE), but i certainly want to know more about this WOMAN.   while STALKING (no, just OBSERVING) her last week, i saw her with her boyfriend. but these recent days, they just past each other. man, now that's IRONIC! i just hope to be close to her more.  my good friend took her picture using my celfone, man, did i ever jumped in glee after finding what my my friend did! i just hope she doesn't suspect yet that there's a person admiring her. yet.  staring at the evening sky, looking for a planet named Venus..............

      man! if there's a day in my life certainly wednesday was a weird one! first of all, my day started with school (as usual!). i reported on natural science (sheesh!!!) about the geological time scale. gladly, i finished my report with a bang; with a compliment from my professor (which i rarely hear from a her!).  then fast-forward to the afternoon. i watched game 1 of the best-of-5 series between the barangay ginebra and red bull. man, was it a blast!!!! we entered the arena behind an undergoing interview; i told my buddy, eli, that there might be a possibility that we might be seen on television, eli just walked in liked i've said nothing. then we found ourselves inside the arena, searching for a decent seat. luckily, we found some, out of the rowdy crowd, behind the opposing team (we are rooting for ginebra.)  the game started with the usual ceremonies, festivities abound, very colorful opening! then on the wide screen we saw ourselves, my friend and me, looking curiously at the camera! man! have we gotten ourselves a 15-minutes, or for that matter, 15-seconds of fame! my instinct was right.   after a grueling shouting taunting, the game ended great. our team won with a slim margin (just a point). then while waiting inside the arena for the crowd to subsidize, we took pictures of ourselves (me, eli and his girlfriend lyra). we also decided to go outside the carpark, where players park their cars. we were not disappointed we the decision! the first one to go out of the coliseum is alex crisano. he was very entertaining with his fans, we even had a good few minutes of chatting with him! what an experience! we even had a picture with him! my friends have a picture of mark caguioa, jayjay helterbrand and eric menk! man! a really weird day! weird but fun!!!!
