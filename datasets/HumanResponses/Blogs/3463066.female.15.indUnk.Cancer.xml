      i got 2 new cds today!! i'm excited. ben kweller (sha sha) and the new switchfoot one. yes, so that was the high point in my day. yesterday at the mall i got a bunch of crap so that also makes me happy, but now i'm almost broke and so i don't have enough for the camara that i wanted. :( poo.   And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45 Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45...

      it's the first day of summer!! yayyy! i just got back from katy's house... we're going to the mall today as soon as i get ready. last night i went to emily's @ 8 and we stayed there til about 11. it was actually kinda fun. after that i went back to katy's house and we sat in her room and talked, then went in the hot tub at 12:30. that was interesting. i think we finally went to sleep somewhere around 2:30. but yeah, now i'm home... for a little while anyway.  i'm so excited that school's out! this summer's gonna be awesome... we leave for virginia on saturday. i think we get back next sunday. after that, my room should pretty much be done so i'll get to move down there. can't wait.  well i suppose i should go get ready, otherwise katy's gonna be pisssed at meee.

      well i got a journal at livejournal.com now so i probably won't be posting in this one all too much. not a lot has been going on, just hanging out and being bored all the time. i wish i could drive sooo bad it's not even funny. but that will all come in time...

      well today certainly ended up being a good day, but it didn't start out that way. my brother makes me so mad sometimes, i could shoot him. but it was worth the fighting, wasn't it eric? ;)  i think i might try calling katy tonight to see what's up. i don't know if she's mad at me or not... pretty curious to find out. i think i have some special talent for getting people mad at me. and the crazy thing is, i don't try to make them mad. i just don't understand. it was finally sunny today. yayy for sunshine.

      i need to get motivated. here i am, sitting here on the computer yet again... but hey, it's not my fault the world is a boring place today. for the third day in a row it's cloudy and cool outside. it's not sunny and warm and bright, and it's not dark and raining either. it's like the world is stuck in the in-between, kind of like i am at this point.

      i am so bored today. i have nothing to do. katy is mad at me because i "overslept" this morning so i couldn't go to the sectional. hey, it's not my fault that i stayed up til 3:00 in the morning last night. well maybe it is a little bit... i got off the internet somewhere around 1:00 then watched sixteen candles -- again. hey, it's a good movie. but now i'm sitting here bored as hell and wondering where everyone is. i wanna do something. eric, you need to call me!

      today was a good day. i got to hang out with eric. yayy eric :) hahhhh katy just left. we were watching sixteen candles but then she had to go. :( joel has an uber-load of people over to play poker. i think they're spending the night too. should be interesting.  i have a sectional tomorrow. i don't want to go but katy's gonna make me. that means i have to get up early. i don't wannnaaaaa. some things just shouldn't be forced on a person.  i say revolution and you say die. die, die, die... die-day-ooo  thanks katelyn. you made my day.

      well i'm finally home. didn't think i would ever make it back. i think last week was one of the longest weeks of my life. don't get me wrong, i did have fun... it's just so good to be home. it was a crazy time getting there though. first our flight was canceled (after we had been sitting on the plane for an hour), then we had to stand in line for an hour and a half waiting to book another flight.. my mom and this other guy went up to complain to the lady at the desk, and they got security called on them. i think that was the highlight of the trip. but anyway.. we finally got another flight with a different airline but when we went down to that airline they said they didn't have room for us. so we got another flight with another airline... we ended up getting into norfolk about 5 hours later than planned. but anyway. i'm back now. yayyyy. today i'm probably just gonna unpack and maybe do some laundry. recover from my ohhh-so-stressful virginia experience. ;)
