      It is late (or early) and I haven't done a damn thing yet to prepare for our house guests.  I have dishes, laundry, floors, dusting etc... to do and here I am surfing the web and blogging.  I don't know what it is with me - I cannot seem to focus and work on household stuff anymore.  I don't know if it is just the working from home or something else.  Now granted I was never a big time house cleaner to begin with, but I never put stuff off this bad.  I guess it is all the family shit going on that just continues to get at me.  You would think after this long I could just not give a fuck.  I guess it is that co-dependency and shit peeking out every once in awhile.  Why is it that women are much more co-dependent then men?  Do we have to make everything better, do we have to make sure everyone is happy?  Motto should be - shit happens - Fuck It!!!  I am going to do that - that is my new damn motto - LOL!!    Other than personal stuff things are going pretty good.  Biz is really moving for the summer months and looking forward to joining some new party plans!!  My party orders from last week should be in later today so they should be surprised to get everything so soon.  Sometimes takes up to 2 weeks.  I have my first official online party this month and a fundraiser later this month!!  Not to mention the parties in between!!    Ok Ok I know you guys are thinking I am nuts about the paper route - I decided to do it.  I mean come on - I am going to get paid to walk now.  Whats hauling a few papers along and tossing them onto porches???  Adds some resistance to the walk and we all know how greedy I am!!!  Maybe I will take a few routes *giggle*!    I am sitting here waiting for the damn papers to arrive!  Talk about quick - I called Thursday and they have me doing papers on Friday!!    TGIF!!!

      Well today is thursday and I gotta tell you it is one of the calmest days of the week for me.  It's nice to sit back typically and not worry about parties, orders coming in, phone calls or anything!!  I do have to get this horrible office organized (you will learn I am one of the most laziest work at home woman there is!!).  We have some friends from Michigan stopping in on Saturday.  Should be fun - I haven't seen them in ages!  So I really got to get this house in order!!  Sad news is that I don't have any parties this weekend!  I do have an online party, a regular in home party and a fundraiser party next week!  I have never done an online party before so this should be intresting!!  I SHOULD take the time and pretype the online party so no one is waiting for the information during the party but we will see!!!  Want to hear something funny???  I have decided that I need to walk more, but I don't like getting up early to beat the heat to walk around here so I am thinking of getting (what till you hear this!!) a paper route - LOL *giggle*.  Figure that way I am forced to get ready and out the door nice and early to get some exercise in!!  I wonder if they will give me a discount to advertise if I am delivering the papers - LMAO!!!  Everyone is going to think I have LOST it!  Oh well at least I know I will be walking every morning!!  The greedy wench that I am I have decided on two other party plans to go with!!  One is a spa like party plan and one is more family oriented.  Talk about hitting all the bases!!  I tell ya I love money.  I cannot wait to build my dream house - if that's not an incentive I don't know what is!!!  Alright I gotta run for now!  Remember to always face life with a smile and a wink! and of course - keep on "buzzin"!!!!!

      Today has been a fun day.  Decided to try blogging my life away!  If only it was that easy!  See I have too much to do but yet I decide to add more!  I am sitting here deciding on my next newsletter to do and thought to hell with this I want something more fun!  I am an in home consultant selling sex toys and edibles.  What more can you ask for?  I have been doing this for two years now and couldn't ask for a better job!!  Talking about the job - think of the perks - items at cost!!!  What more can you ask for??  Too many options and items for a fun weekend with the hubby.  But ssshhh - he doesn't know yet!!   The poor man never knows what is in store for him half the times.  He comes home and my kit items are all over the place (picture that - penis shaped toys all through the livingroom) all because I decided I needed to video tape my demostration to help change things up at parties, or he will come home and find that I have so many different direct selling plan options strewn about because I have decided to "expand".  You will soon learn that I am one greedy wench.  Gotta make more money and more money!!  Well enough of my rambling.  Remember if it doesn't buzz it's not worth it!!
