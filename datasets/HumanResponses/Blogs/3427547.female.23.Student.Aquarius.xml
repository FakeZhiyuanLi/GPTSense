      Wow. I am so embarrassed. And I don't know how to fix it. I had my first day of work today at Central Production Pharmacy warehouse. And I am very pumped about it because it is really close (by car) to where Janet lives. So I got a ride to work with Janet today at 7 and arrived at 7:30. My boss was really great and very nice and gave me a schedule. I'll be getting off most days at 3:15 and on others at 4:30. Today I got off at 3:15pm. The arrangements today were that I was to take the bus from the warehouse, transfer to the train, then transfer back to a new bus to get home. But the thing is, the bus came early, and everybody at CP who takes the bus missed it, including me. The next bus didn't come for 35 minutes, so I thought: the drive was really short, I'll walk home.   I think in my head the drive was a lot shorter, because the walk took almost 2 hours. And here's the kicker. I was less than 30 seconds away from the house when I second guessed myself and became convinced I wasn't going the right way. So one secret room away from the treasure, so to speak, I turned around, walked through a wrong strange neighborhood for half an hour, went back to the last familiar intersection and hit the convenience store. I called Janet at work first because it was 5:15ish. Too late, I had missed her. I figured she wasn't home yet, so I called a cab. I waited and waited and waited and it never came. Probably becasue it was 45 minutes till game time and everyone in this city was trying to get home really fast. Then I called Janet at home..busy. So I saw the Safeway across the street and thought: I need a few things to add to my lunches. So I walked over and picked them up. At the Safeway there was a direct line to a cab. I called it and they gauranteed 10 minutes. A good 20-25 minutes later I caught one and took it back. The worst part was I knew that everyone in the family would be home having dinner and would probably make a fuss if I revealed I had gotten lost. Plus I was so embarrassed. So I fibbed a bit which I never do and I'm being eaten by guilt right now. All I can hear in my head is Vince saying adamantly GOD HATES IT WHEN YOU LIE. aaaaaah! I said I had been shopping and then walked up Falconridge. What a dork I am. I was so embarrassed though, and I didn't want anyone to feel bad because I got wonderful directions about the bus, I just missed it!! I think I came off as appearing to not care about being home in time for supper.  Plus I shot any small amounts of time to spend with Janet this evening. I suckkkkkk!!!!!!! aaaarg! I am vowing to never do this again.    They saved me supper, that was awesome.  Ok. Tomorrow is a new day. :-) GOD FORGIVE ME FOR BEING A SUPREME RETARD.

      "Live for the one who gives you life after the end Live for the one who is your daily bread Give all you have to living pure And you will be rich, you will be blessed, you will be of joy You will be rich, you will be blessed, you will be of joy"  It's the chorus. I have not written the verses yet. It always amazes me how easily a melody and lyrics will come out of nowhere one night in less than 10 minutes, wheras I will be frustrated working on a song for months and months with no luck.   I'm trying to be constructive. I always find emotional closure from writing songs after an intense relationship or physically intimate encounter with someone. Instead of trying to find meaning in the events, this time I am  trying to make myself remember how I should be living my life and what I should be striving for (instead of concentrating on what went wrong).   However, I'm still baffled over what went wrong. I don't know why Ben acted the way he did. I was at his house for a few minutes watching the Flames game before he was to drive me home. I know he is inexperienced and sexually excited very easily. But I barely know him. Were not that close. And Ive only previously hung out with him in group situtions. Why would he feel so comfortable with me to suddenly tear all of his clothes off as if I were his steady girl that he knew and trusted and was ready to become intimate with. I mean, I barely know him!! how embarrassing but difficult to object to! Next time I see him I dont even know how I'm going to handle myself or what to say. I mean. What do you say? "Hi Ben! Hows it going?  Do I even mention it?        Do I pretend it didnt happen?  I hope I am never in that situation ever again.   Speaking of Bens. Mike and I are mulling over trying to get out to New Hampshire to see Ben Folds with Rufus Wanwright this summer. We'll see if this hypothetical plan can turn to reality.  (I hope!!!!)
