      the free food place near my apt .. the religious center that gives out free pizza every thursday evening .. it's all the more crowded these days ... i mean when my roomies were going there .. it used to be crowded too .. but the line used to just abt come out the door ... now it's spilling over to the grass and even the walkway by the road on most thursdays !! also .. i see people in the line whom i never expected to see there .. dont know why .. but u have certain ideas/impressions abt people u see around you [even if u dont know them] and seeing these specific people in that line somehow contradicted the impression i had of them !   free bowling and billiards rocked last nite ... won loads of stuff in the free raffle ... we [my roomie] won a mountain bike !!! and bowling was fun too ... being out of practice is not fun in bowling ... and the freakin ball is so damn heavy !! im sure it'll stick to the floor and knock out the pins while still being a bit lighter ... i dont know why they dont do it .. but then im just a beginner .. what do i know of bowling ..  i had this super piece written abt just before my exam started yest. morning ... ive forgotten to get it with me right now to put in here .. but will do so later sometime .. which also reminds me .. was reading the univ paper yest and there was an article abt how a prof thinks there shud be discussion in classrooms ... he is a political science professor .. and im safely assuming there's no technical things in there ... coz when u r learning electronics .. not many professors bother abt what you think .. there's fixed ways to do things .. and rules to follow .. not many know why the rules were made in the first place .. and why systems and models were built the way they were ... the truly brilliant and inspiring ones in this field are not accesible to everyone and not everyone shares the same concerns in the field .. the field [like any other] is vast and wide-spread ... making it all the more difficult to follow it as a field !! so the point im trying to make is discussions are good in classrooms .. but somehow technical classes see less room for students opinions ... hehe .. who would pay me if i were to go ahead and say things like "Z-transforms are dope" ... im not saying it ... it's just that the Electrical Engineering world would laugh at anyone [even if s/he were legitimate] who comes up with such ideas ..  this weekend brings awesome matchups in football , both college and nfl ... there's 8 big time games which will have big repercussions on what the BCS standings show on monday ... here's a sampling .. and im gonna hazard a pick for each game !  1. Oklahoma State at Oklahoma - i think it's OU's year this time around ... do u know that OSU hasnt beaten OU thrice in a row in quite a long time ? maybe they could break that jinx ... but my gut feeling is OU will not go down this time .. both teams have work cut out for them.  2. Miami at Virginia Tech - Miami ... VTech just got a bit ahead of themselves when they were already thinking of the miami game while they hadnt beaten West Virginia yet .. hehe .. it's ridiculous ... they shud have played WV as if they were miami and the game should have been a rout ! instead .. we all know what happened.  3. Georgia - Florida - i'll say Georgia ... they're playing some good football this time around .. and Florida hasnt really been all that impressive in their run this year.   4. Nebraska - Texas - the Longhorns shud be able to pull out a win .. though to tell you the truth .. i'd said in here that texas would give OU a fight in the red river shootout .. hehe .. so u know the level of my knowledge ! but frankly .. i pick texas coz austin is closer to me [it's my home system team - UT]  than nebraska.  5. Ohio State - Penn State - i wish Joe Paterno wins against this Ohio st. team ... they dont deserve to be national champions ... finals appearance was all they deserved ... but sad to say Penn St isnt doing much to win these days .. looks like Ohio will win.  well .. thats just the NCAA football !!! sunday brings some good matchups in NFL .... a new matchup of big offense with big defense ... the colts head to miami ... and it's to be seen who comes out the winner there .. personally i think the dolphins shud win ... they have a winning streak [not that the colts dont !] and their confidence is high coz griese is doing it for them rather than all ricky williams [ go UT !!! hehe] ... but then u can never know how mr. manning decides to suddenly show up and win the game with his trusted sidekick mr. harrison ! u can say it's a toss up .. among other matchups .. there's the broncos-pats game ... i think the broncos would have won easily if they had plummer going .. but they being depleted .. i pick the pats ... also green bay plays at the vikings [no way anyone's picking the packers in this one !] and cowboys play the redskins at home ... this one shud be good ... parcells is surely mad abt how his players played the bucs game .. and he's as eager to win against washington as any of the players on the team .. probably more than any of them ! most of the other games suck ... though the NY-NY battle might be worth watching.  this has been such a long post ... i dont remember when i started writing ... and im sure my session at blogger has ended by now ... so i better copy-paste this entry somewhere before i try posting it ... this is how blogger ate my entry the last time around ... im not making the same mistake twice.

      i read the linked blogs daily [if there's an update ie. !] and most of them have something significant ... something personal ... something happening ... and i invariably compare it to my blog ... my blog features more of the routine .. more of whats happening around me .. or with me .. the generic things ... like most kiddy blogs have ... the quiz results and stuff ... now that i think about why it is so ... i realize that i want this place to be really anonymous ... some ppl now know this place exists and belongs to me ... so they can relate to everything personal that i put in here ... maybe i dont really want that .. thats not how i am ... so im a bit cautious as i proceed with my latest posts.  anyways .. i slept really early last nite ... around 10pm .. dinner was at CiCi's pizza .. and it follows that i was full :) .. but it was nice .. and though i tried to study .. sleep just took over and i was in bed and probably snoring by 10:30 ! ... what followed was really deep sleep and i finally awoke at 5:15 i think ... which made me wonder if 7hrs of sleep is enough for me ... i generally dont sleep for more than 7hrs at a stretch ... ie. i might decide to lay around in bed after the 7hrs stretch .. but most of the times ... i will wake up within 7hrs of when i slept ... is it enough ? maybe .. i dont know though, why i slept at 10 last nite .. i mean my routine for monday [or for any other day for that matter] doesnt involve any physical stress that would cause this.  morning was really pleasant .. there was a cool breeze around and the sky was cloudy preventing the harsh light of the sun while still maintaining the nice morning hue in the atmosphere ... i went to class ready to study .. ready to ask questions ... ready to solve last sems paper .. to review topics for the quiz ... it felt nice .. for the first time in weeks i felt really enthusiastic about the day ! i shud get up earlier more often now on ... will certainly help ..  dolphins played the chargers [MNF] at the sun devil stadium in tempe, az last nite .. they shifted the venue coz of the fire in southern cali ... Qualcomm stadium was setup as a relief camp for the fire affected people ... and hence they couldnt play there ... chargers lost giving me a decent 9-5 record for this week in my personal picks game !

      Blogger ate my log this morning … I mean I typed it all in and it was so long that in the end when I tried to post it .. .blogger simply ended my session .. and my entry was gone .. coz I typed it straight into the blogger window instead of saving it elsewhere and pasting it here … so .. Im kinda bored now to write it down all over again .. and hence the entry is being recreated in points only .. hehe ! anyways .. I’d blabbered on and on .. and maybe all of it wasn’t needed .. but that was my entry … my hands had been running all over the keyboard to type my memories of the weekend .. so only points –    - Semi-major fire at the central utility building on the univ campus caused loss of power [electricity] to all the buildings on campus. Campus closed all weekend disabling any kind of meaningful activity. No computers, no sports, no library … no vending machines even !!   - Diwali over the weekend sucked for many reasons, major one being im away from home and family and friends. Then u have the other smaller reasons .. which don’t have much of a value .. but are there nonetheless, like not as many sweets or new clothes or lanterns … no festivities in general. Diwali was nice and quiet though … fire crackers are illegal in the usa … so no noise and air pollution here … hehe .. even ganpati was peaceful.  - No much in the studies dept. over the weekend .. [almost] completed studies for today’s test .. and a few extras for the tests coming this Thursday. More needed to be done .. but then the amazing inborn quality of laziness kicked in and the dip in temp didn’t help much too .. felt like sleeping in a lot.  - Cowboys faced an embarrassing loss at the hands of the superbowl champions. The dallas offense just didn’t show up and make any significant plays … they were almost sleepwalking thru the game I tell you. The defense did its part but the offense left much to be desired. Redskins next week shud expect the frustration of this loss to be taken out on them.  I think that was all that was there in my morning entry … nothing more to add right now .. better get down to studies.

      everything on campus is closed today ... we had this big fire at the central utility bldg due to which it seems we lost some power ... and now to build it all back up [the power system] they'll need time ... the bldg was going down anyways .. the univ was making space for a new research facility and demolition of the utility plant was to start yesterday ... and we had the fire !! it was big ... and the news agencies covered it live ... no one was injured ... maybe some minor injuries to a couple of people.  was watching a dog show on animal planet this morning .. and it reminded me of my dog ... nostalgia !!!

             You are... WAIT! - you're none of the Sins you're an Angel! Perfect, or close enough, and annoyingly so! Did you always behave so 'just right'. ARGHHH . You can annoy the hell outta people with your attitude, but no doubt your church is real happy with you. The positive side certainly outweighs the negative, after all, you do chores, are smart, are cute, do charity work. Least you know what a perfect saint you are. You just make the rest of us sinners vomit. Perhaps you could break the rules once in a while, go wild - Eat an extra cookie or something. However - congratulations on being the most pure, of the entire human race.     urlLink   ??

      here's my picks for the nfl weekend ... no ornate tables ... just the name of the team i think will win. so the 14 teams are -- Vikings, Patriots, Saints, Cowboys [yes !! over the bucs !], Titans, Ravens, Bears [amusing matchup this], Seahawks, Rams, 49ers, Colts, Eagles [total gut feeling], Chiefs, Dolphins.  so there it is ... now i'll get back to my studying ... damn .. all exams in the same week :(

      wow ! that was a scare for a moment there ... the posts didnt show up and i though i lost em all ... anyways !  big matchup coming in Cowboys season this weekend ... they play in tampa ... and whatever degree of optimism you can achieve from looking at Bill Parcells guide the team is not enough to predict an easy win for the boys... but it is enough to say that the bucs wont have anything easy ... the boys will surely fight for everything .. and might just come out of it all with the win ! lots of tough games to pick this week ...   anyways ... i'd better run .. o yes ! predictions for the sunday games coming up tonite or tomm morning.

      good going for the 'boys as they go up to no. 7 in the nfl power rankings at espn.com. dallas has been unable to get out of the dump and had maintained a sub 20 ranking for a better part of the last 3 years .. and now .. with them heading into tampa this weekend .. there's a good chance we'll fight the super bowl champions instead of being submissive. the bucs haven't been on top of their game lately .. they lost to a horrible [this season] San Fran team ... so why not dream abt a win in tampa !! one more for the tuna boys .. lets go get em !  yankees won last nite in a rain ridden match ... there was a delay .. but yankees managed an 8th inning seperation when they scored 5 runs ... to take the game 6-1. good game guys .. i hope you can maintain your game, coz you easily get sloppy after an easy win.  on the personal front .. lots of work to be done .. but ive planned out everything ... so no need to worry ... hehe ! ive become a big planner now .. never imagined that would be true ... but i do plan things for the coming week or so .. there's been in a rise in activity level as ive joined the gym ... running... jogging .. cycling .. whatever's available.  o btw ... there's an imp news !! espn stopped publishing TMQ and says it wont be available there anymore .. how sad .. i rather enjoyed the insanely-long articles in that series ... maybe i'll find something new in the same vein.

      guess what, there's pretty much to write today .. i lot to muse about [i chk to confirm if muse is a verb .. dumb of me?]. first off [as always] sports news ... the mavs swung a major deal monday morning ... bringing in antoine walker and tony delk for raef lafrentz and a couple of sideys ... actually lafrentz himself would be called a sidey .. coz he's not really done much here .. but in the east .. he's a competent center !! he'll do wonders with his 7+ ft and 3point shooting ability there. but the imp part of the trade was who came to dallas ... yes .. walker isnt the best player around ... he's a ball hog .. and shoots three's when he shud be passing the ball .. he was in bad shape last season .. but then there's a few +ves to it all .. nellie is a coach who's always gotten some disfunctional groups to play as a team and succeed ... he'll surely find a role on the team for 'toine to play to perfection ... plus as David Aldridge of ESPN puts it, the situation is not so bad in Big D. here's what he has to say ...   "But if there's anyone who loves throwing guys out on the floor without a thought to their normal position, it's Nellie. If the Mavs zone it up more this season, they could force you to face these five at the other end: Walker at point forward, Nash (or Delk) at the two, Michael Finley at the three, Jamison at the four -- and Dirk Diggler in the middle! What center do you know that's going to chase him around screens? "   in football news ... kansas city maintains their win streak this season by a yard .. or so it would seem ... the raiders almost forced overtime but failed as tim brown was stopped at the 1-yard line  by 2 KC defenders ... i think though that even if the game had gone to OT .. KC would have found a way to win. this was the first weekend of my picks ...  and ive not done bad at all ... i maintain my own picks game ... i do the picks for myself and compare them with the picks made by the espn experts ! and this week im second with a 10-4 record ... pretty good for first time.  then there's my academics .. class this morning was dull as usual .. but the prof gave a stimulant .. hehe .. he's expecting one of the homeworks on thursday [day after !!!] and there's the 2nd quiz coming up on thursday next week ! so gotto study for that ... and then there's the monday nite quiz ... and the tuesday evening quiz to contend with next week ... so next week is busy as hell .. hopefully i can get some things done before time so it's not as difficult next week ...  i have today's quiz to contend with before anything else.  i had this dream last nite ... i dont rem what it was ... but i distinctly remember thinking i shud have writing pad at my bedside with a pen/pencil to write these things down ... i was like [still in my dream] .. " i shud write this down ... o .. forget it ,.. i dont have anything to write this down on ... so sleep on" ... haha .. is that amusing ? and i dont remember the dream now ... so it kinda proves my point.

      whats with me and my social behaviour ? im not really open and friendly all the times and it bothers me right now ... this is with reference to an incident that happened yesterday ... i was coming into the computer lab and this fine young lady [cute chic even !] was on her way out .. one of the two doors was broken so there was only one way in ... so i opened the door and waited for her to go out so i cud enter ... she politely said thank you ... now all that was expected of me [i expect this of me] was a simple "welcome" or "no mention" or "no probs" or some such thing ... and im sure, had it been some american ... i would have said it ... but the girl being an indian i didnt venture ... my lips froze .. and this simple one word return of courtesy was left hanging ... is it so difficult to develop this simple habit ? maybe ... but mostly not.  the yankees beat the marlins 6-1 with andy petitte going 8 2/3. he gave up a run in the last inning which was bcoz of an error by Arron Boone i think. why is this player still there in the lineup ? just bcoz he hit the winning home run against boston ? i mean .. thats his only achievement .. otherwise the guy hasnt done anything !!! nothing ...

      whats it that keeps me going ? whats my final destination in life ? most things in life have a definite life cycle ... like - u enter school .. to get thru with good marks and pass matriculation ... the aim is to get into a good college ... and even if this aim will take atleast 10-12 yrs to achieve .. u have one ! and im sure that there'll be ppl who work towards this aim from the time they start [unlike myself]. mankind somehow has failed to explain life as a system and nature has been successful in keeping its rules a secret. man cannot [i dont know why not !] explain his own presence on earth and the time taken by man to get here seems unduely long. i mean what was happening in all those years of evolution ... the evolution man has done in the last 100 years is so fast ... why didnt that happen earlier ? so many questions are unanswered and remain that way for centuries ... there's surely some point for us to be here right ? so pls pls ... pretty pls .. can someone .. anyone .. explain it to me ?   i have no idea what i will do with the answer ... but the answer is sure to change my life ... hell, it'll change anyone's life .. no ?  im going home and cooking fried baingan .. eggplant is rich in proteins they say and im dying to eat fried eggplant ... ive printed a couple of recipes ... and thats whats cooking !

      the former conjoined twins from egypt are doing great. they were operated upon to seperate the two. nbc's local affiliate has this to say abt the two: "Doctors in Dallas Sunday said newly separated twins Ahmed and Mohamed continue to show neurological improvements. Both boys have had fevers and are on antibiotics, but have no significant infections."  im just bored staying at home ... the more i stay the more futile i feel ... restless ... maybe i shud have gone to the gym .. but i chose to come here ... the football was good in the morning .. dallas beat the lions hands down. no comments there except that dallas shud have been better ... but then ... i always expect better of my team ! among other results .. some were shocking .. like san fran beat the bucs 24-7 .... mainly on the play of their defence which forced 4 turnovers. and then there was the baltimore - cincinnati game ... where i thought jamal lewis would run amok thru the bengals defense .. but turns out he didnt do enough ... his 101 yards total for the game was more than the team rushing yards by cinci !! hehe .. cincinnati won 34-26 .. so im guessing they had a couple of defensive turnovers ... or their avg starting field position was really really good ! whatever ... they have a win .. a second one at that ! hehe ... so dallas is not the only team to have reached last years win total by now ! i started maintaining my weekly picks score for myself from this weekend onwards .. so lets see how ive done .. not too bad i think.

      i havent been able to work this out yet ... i think ive solved the problem though there's no way to really find it out unless i install PWS somewhere and run my webpage with server-side javascript operational. the only reason im not going to do all that is coz i dont have my own permanent computer ... i know it'll run that way for sure ... coz other rss aggregators use php scripting to do the same thing .. all ive changed is the language .. so im quite sure it'll work. the best way to go right now is to create a webpage that aggregates the feeds from my personal choice of news sources and save it to my network drive .. that way i can access the news till i graduate ... after that ... maybe i'll have a pc of my own .. and we'll see from then on.  the day's been pretty busy .. i'd been chatting all morning along with the programming of webpage and it was fun ... i was multitasking big time ... chatting on one side .. writing the program .. chking out some rss feeds to see how i could parse one .. as well as go thru my staple of espn page 2 ! hehe .. good article  urlLink here  by Bill Simmons abt how the red sox lost and how red sox fans are stuck in a bad fan-sport marriage :) .. hehe .. it's good to know they dont change sides. and it was great to watch the yankees win after hitting pedro to level the game at 5-5. pedro sucks .. solely coz of what he tried to pull off during game 3 ... no way he was winning it all while being such a loser and threatening the opposing team. i lost track of what i was saying ... yeah .. so i did all those things today ... and though there must have been a few more interesting things to write about ... i dont recall anything really important abt today.  ive been thinking abt putting one of those neat small calendars here. most of the weblogs/sites powered by  urlLink MovableType  have one .. though im not sure if MT provides them with it or otherwise ... it seems like MT provides it coz all of them have the same look and feel .. so maybe someone can give me a similar calendar for my website ... maybe a javascript version or something ... i'll look into it.

      i dont know whats special with this one friend's computer or internet connection ... but she's the only one seeing anything on my 'rss aggregation' page coded in javascript. i started working on it this morning .. and it works just fine while on the server ... that is if i access it from my network drive .. it works perfectly ... but it doesnt work when i try to access it over the internet .. says the page that im trying to access is denying access to my page. now i have no freakin idea as to why this shud be so .. but the xml/rdf files put out by the major news providers arent accessible to my page's javascript ... which is sad coz im just small time netizen trying out something new ... or maybe ... just maybe im doing something wrong somewhere ! hehe .. thats a possibility too .. a major one i'd guess ! i think im gonna research more into that ...

      ok kind of a day it's been .. sat like a zombie in the dsp class, not knowing what was going on .. but thats normal for me .. in such situations i always carry around a print out of the latest espn article on football or basketball .. today it was "first and 10" by john clayton, who for some reason thinks san diego at cleveland is a better game than dallas at detroit ... well !! maybe it is .. coz i dont know how the lions are doing this season .. well well ... i simply forgot that mr. mariucci is heading the lions this time around .. and even though they aren't the team to beat even in their own division, they wont be pushovers for the more confident cowboys. i guess it's ok afterall that dallas-detroit didnt feature in the article.  found a new site today -  urlLink sautewednesday.com . pretty cool site that lists a lot of things related to food and cooking.   chat with mom was great today ... chatted for a long time .. and was thinking of saving it [chat transcript]. somehow in the end i didnt think of it .. and closed the window regardless ... so i dont have much of recollection of what we said .. which is bad .. coz i would have said some things which might need remembrance ! hehe .. all the same .. it was good.  vhdl class at 5:30 requires me to print my project proposal .. which is on it's way to the printer now.

      one of my hobbies [a special one at that !] is procrastination ... and ive just proved that to myself by playing pool with a rude canadian girl. we played abt 30 odd games and at the end of it all this female asks me why ive not talked all this while ... she hadnt talked all this while either ! but i guess she was just as bored playing me as i was playing her .. anyways .. she just quit and here i am .. hehe .. writing my blog instead of playing some more .. aint that passing time in a nice way :)  the yankees have lost game 6 by the score of 9-6 as boston finally mustered some strength to hit some runs. nomar garciaparra, who's had a depressing post season so far finally scored some runs this time around. game 7 is when ? lemme chk - yeah .. it's tomm in ny. shud be fun to watch ... clemens goes to work against martinez again !! expect fireworks.  i dont have much to do this week now .. i had the project proposal for vhdl to finish .. which im done with .. so i'll submit that tomm .. other than that .. there's no homework to complete and no test to study for .. so this weekend shud be really relaxed.

      red sox loose. not the happiest moment of my life or anything ... but it's good to know they lost. after what happened in game 4, i quite naturally put them in the same class as pakistani cricketers .. atleast paki cricketers are really good [if only in fits] at what they do ... the red sox are just being obnoxious for nothing ... well .. to have said this and nothing abt the yankees would be wrong ... the yankees arent really the purest, simplest guys either ... so there goes .. i have my judgement out on the matter .. hehe .. no one asked me .. but still.  the cubs lead their series 3-1 and most probably they'll make it to the world series.  they lead the game 1-0 right now .. good for chicago ... reaching this stage of the playoffs after so many years. haha .. i guess they were waiting for all the other teams to make it to the world series before they did it again ! [i dont have the stats on that ... it's just a joke]  o yeah !! remember the egyptian twins joint at their head ? well they were being kept in a drug-induced coma after the 34hr operation. now the doctors believe they can reduce dosage of the drug and get the twins back to normal slowly and steadily ... the twins are supposedly doing well. thats good news :)

      some very beautiful reading done today ... and today's  urlLink ziggy  is good too ! the amazing pieces ive read today include TMQ [official favorite article of mine for 2003 - this is the year i discovered it !] ... it's really funny today though it also talks abt things other than football more today ... maybe bcoz there's not much football to talk abt this week ? how about if TMQ expanded to college football ?   and then there was  urlLink this piece  about how and why God is a male. written by a female ofcourse - u'll know it too once u read it - it is really good and simple .. and small !   not much going on other than that ... done with the vhdl project for class this evening ... and ready for the next project ... will have to take my dsp paper from the TA while going back home right now ..

      great football day today ... the "boys" [americas team - with respect to tex schramm who supposedly coined the term] beat the "birds" [philly eagles] 23-21 in a match that was a thru and thru defensive battle ... both defenses made the opp. offense fight to score points but in the end dallas came up winners with a billy cundiff field goal at the end of 4th.   right now there's this amazing game going on at lambeau field where kansas city takes on the packers ... packers were leading comfortably going into the last quarter .. but kc managed to claw back and now has a lead of a touchdown in OT !! guess what .. it looks like KC will keep their win streak going ... there was some interesting statistice abt this in the morning - only one team with a streak of 3 or more wins going into lambeau field had won the game .. and 12 others had lost ... so the odds were pretty much stacked up against kc .. but they are the team to beat right now .. chiefs beat packers 40-34 in OT.   among the other unbeatens indy lost to carolina [no shit !!] at home, 23-20 in OT. damn ... nobody has really paid attention to carolina this season .. but they've put together a really neat winning streak here ... stephen davis is doing really well at RB but the team cant win without a joint effort ... another explanation for the indy loss - indy played their hearts out last monday against tampa. hehe .. i know it's a stupid excuse .. but im sure some "expert" will come up with that one ! looks like minnesota have a bye week this time. so there you have it .. minnesota, carolina and kansas city still unbeaten as indy gets their first loss of the season.  one surprising [atleast for me !] result is the raiders loss to browns ... i mean, yes, agreed the raiders suck this season .. but it seems so hard to accept such a vast difference in a team's level of play from one superbowl to next season. losing to the browns kinda seals the horrible season they're having ... they might as well officially give up and start preparing for the next season !  football apart ... schumi won his 4th straight and 6th career formula1 driver's championship today at suzuka, japan. the win for barrichello kept kimi raikonnen out of first place and a possible championship .. but it looked pretty darn difficult for him anyways .. coz schumi finished 8th which gave him a point and victory. ferrari won the GP, the constructer's championship, and schumi [driving for ferrari] won the driver's championship. tripple delight at japan.

      what a day in sports today ! the yankees renewed their bitter rivalry with boston in their 4-3 win today. the 4th inning was really embarassing for baseball after it looked like pedro martinez might have started it all. the end of it all [well almost !]was that martinez threw down don zimmer [72 yrs old] by the head ... thats a really sad story ... though don zimmer might have started it by lunging at pedro .. whatever .. it was sad to see the old man on the ground ... bottom line - yankees take game 3 and a 2-1 series lead.  in football .. it was a really really embarassing day for texas as they got pasted 65-13 ... haha .. thats how they defeated rice as we all remember ... so u can imagine how strong this OU team really is .. texas is no minnow .. but they were surely treated like one today ... OU played like the #1 ranked team that they are ... they are on their way to big things for sure .. Bob Stoops is running a great program .. wow .. it would be fun to watch them win the natl. championship over miami. VTech is also really hot right now .. though they are winning against relatively smaller and lower ranked teams ... today's victim was syracuse  ... the score 51-7.  big game for the cowboys tomm as philly comes to town ... you can say that philly owns dallas. dallas has been beaten pretty convincingly for the past 6 yrs. here's a statistic to cement that statement - "The Eagles have beaten Dallas six consecutive times by an average of 23.5 points." this being the first eagles-cowboys game under bill parcells, a lot better is expected this time than the last 6 times under dave campo. the losing streak just might end tomm since the eagles arent doing so well with mcnabb struggling .. but he's improving and the eagles defense  is tough as ever ... so a win is not really expected ... whats expected is a tough fight for 4 quarters ... whats expected is to not have eagles celebrating a win at half time. hopefully we'll get that ! and if the cowboys can conjure up a win .. which they certainly can ... it'll be a festive day in dallas.  among other news on the studies front - not much done ... lots remains to be covered yet and only 48 hrs remain .. lets see how i can do it .. coz doing it i am !  and then there's the conjoined twins that are being operated upon here in dallas at the Children's Medical Center .. hope they survive the operation.  o yeah, how'd i forget ! think schumi will make it tonite ? i think he will .. winning and schumi finishing worse than 8th is too much to ask for from kimi i think ... though he's a very good driver. once schumi is gone .. the field will be open for the likes of alonso, montoya, kimi, ralf and maybe trulli .. poor old jarno trulli .. missed out on the pole bcoz of stupid rains yesterday.

      oh yeah ! how'd i forget this .... i made a new sandwich today ... u know they have the BLT and BMT and stuff like that ... i made the HOT sandwich .. hehe .. guess what that is ! it's ham, onion and tomato !! how about that han ? lol ... it tastes good .. though the onion tends to overpower the other ingredients in taste .. ham cannot be overpowered so easily .. so i suggest less of onion [maybe a slice] and more of tomato .. i put in honey-mustard sauce in there and it tasted good ..  too cool infact ... i need to try something with the chicken now ..  the red river shootout tomm .. they'll show it on tv and thats where i'll have to watch it :( .. but then - atleast i get to watch it on TV !! hope it's good and texas fights ou .. though the immense odds are against a texas win.

      interesting article  urlLink here  about how Andy Grove - chairman of Intel is concerned abt the outsourcing of technology related services that is so abundant today. just yesterday i was reading abt global companies and how they dont really owe and allegiance to one nation ... and today im reading this .. and i think we need more global organizations .. there's enough animosity between certain countries and we do not need business rivalries to be played out on the international stage ... well yes .. there's the national pride part ... but we can find something else, something better to proud of .. cant we ? some of the points made in the article re-emphasize how india is slowly but surely taking over US businesses ... not merging with them or buying them out (thats the US way !) but by having indians in the companies work their way up to controlling positions. India is providing better services at cheaper prices which will attract anyone .. not just the US. Mr. Grove says, "More than 50% of graduate students are international". He'd know for sure .. coz his company is hiring so many skilled and brainy indians !! jokes apart .. it's a very true statement .. and i'd expand it by saying that more than half of those international students are indians .. so for now .. it looks like india is the big python [anaconda shall we say :)] that has its sights set on the US economy. India which looks small and incapable opening it's mouth wide enough to swallow the much larger pray, will sooner or later control the US economy than the other way round.  anyways .. i slept this afternoon ... more than 2 hours .. i shudnt have but i did it anyways .. now its gonna be hard to sleep at nite unless i can get tired again !! thats not the point though .. i couldve got some studying done .. which i didnt do any of .. i have my sites set ... so i'll get there, one way or the other.  got my credit card today ... need to get some  things done in that regard ... started that line of work. my right hand palm had been itching since morning - it means im getting some money - and i got this cc in the afternoon mail .. cool right ? hehe .. my palms still itching .. so maybe there's some more coming :)

      found a bigger better Curveball  urlLink here . was looking for a stand-alone appln actually .. but found this first .. doesnt matter .. this is good too !  Yankees win 6-2 tonite ... series tied 1-1 ... hehe .. wouldnt it be great to have a Cubs-Sox world series ? but then yankees-marlins wouldnt be bad either ... personally i'd love for the yankees to win it all .. whoever might be on the losing end.  oh yeah ! made chicken tonite ... was good .. though ive had better :)  ... but i made it .. and it was edible .. hehe .. thats the main part of it ... no ice cream in the fridge ... so will have to wait for next walmart trip now .. thats one thing im used to by now .. ice cream every nite .. even every afternoon if i can ;)

      slow start today ... 9:30am class as usual .. i got up at 8:30 ... and it was like i got up out of the blue :) ... one moment i was in deep slumber and the next i was up and awake and thinking abt wether it was time to go to class .. hehe ! how funny right ? but this is what causes slow starts to the day ..  anyways .. so i dragged the body that is me to class only to get bored just sitting there ... thought i wont attend it and got out of there ... the plan was to work on my vhdl project ... or atleast go meet that prof and ask him for some help with Xilinx (the synthesis s/w) ... but his office hours are for later this afternoon .. so will go and talk to him then. got to know the part of syllabus that is to be studied for the mid-term in the Engg Mngt class ... lots to study there ... so might as well get on with that too.  other than that - life is coolax ! watched 'Gangajal' (movie - Ajay Devgan) half way thru ... very melodramatic ... the kind of movie i dont like ... but some things in it were quite truly depicted .. i mean the police force is pretty much the way theyve shown it .. but i couldnt sit thru it.

      there's so much to follow in this world .. news i mean .. even if you narrow it down to sports ... there's a ton of sports news happening around the world and it's all interesting ... so how do u decide what to follow ? for a person like me .. it's a difficult choice and so i have my priorities ... first and foremost i follow sports close to me .. like if im in india, i will follow cricket and hockey and formula 1 ... then come the premiership and european club football (soccer to ppl here in the US) .. and then there's other fringe sports ... like rugby .. which, though i like to watch, i dont really follow year round. once in a while .. the rugby world cup shows up .. and im into rugby for then :) ... occasional follower is what you might call that.  the point here is .. for occasional followers .. how do u they decide on which team they like ? they go on past performances, star players .. maybe geograhic locations of the country .. and then there's the wierd reasons ... reasons u cant explain but still like the team for ! anyways ... rugby world cup is coming .. and i have no clear fav. i'd love it new zealand wins it .. coz i like the all blacks .. i like the way they play and i like their warrior "pre-war" dance ! hehe .. i dont know what they call it .. but so what !  other than that .. the day has started out good ... i had this slight neck sprain when i got up ... but thats gone now .. ive been chatting with mom for a while right now .. and that's always good! yeah ... one thing i wanted to write in here is a list of things im gonna eat once im back home .. so here goes - 1. SPDP 2. Kapila kathi kabab 3. Sabudana khichadi 4. Dosa/uttappa 5. biryani 6. steak sizzler  this is just a prelimnary list of things ... not the exhaustive one that i have in mind ! but its there .. and im gonna try and eat all of them while in india  ... lets see how that goes ...

      just finished reading TMQ ... the feature thats supposed to come out every tuesday morning actually comes out every tuesday afternoon ... like 1nish CST !! TMQ tries to explain the delay .. well .. excuses are always plenty .. the feature might as well be named TAQ (T Afternoon Q) .. hehe .. but the excuse that most of the time zones are still mornings is quite good .. so there .. it's still TMQ .. not that anyone was changing it anyways ... good feature ... im getting addicted to this one and needless to say i enjoy it thoroughly

      i'm enamoured with the Food Channel ... i love seeing food prep programs hours on the end which is what i just did for more than 3 hrs .. the idea of watching food being prepared is in itself so appealing to me that i dont mind the fact that i dont get to eat any of it .. but my cooking is improving too .. we had chicken fried rice for lunch !! made from yesterday's leftover rice and the chicken strips we got ..   TMQ published pretty late .. after noon .. they shud make it a point to put it up by 11am .. coz we ppl wait for it you know ! they shudnt make us readers wait like that ... hehe .. sometimes the monday nite games are so boring (almost depressing) that TMQ is the only thing left to cheer us up and keep us hooked up to football .. for example next monday Falcons vs Rams .. damn .. barring a miracle .. im sure that game would be less than humdrum .. so next tuesdays TMQ gains that much more importance. i cant read TMQ right now .. i have this weekly quiz in VHDL class .. but im printing it .. so i can read it after the quiz .. more on that later in the evening.

      o yeah ! forgot to write abt the indy-tampa bay match last nite ... indy was trailing 35-14 till abt 10 min into 4th quarter ... 4 mins left and peyton manning decided to rally indy to 35-35 by the end of regulation ... wow ! and they won it in OT ... tampa defence kinda relaxed it seemed ... otherwise there was no way .. absolutely no way a team comes back from that kind of deficit to win in OT ... damn ! .. but it's good in one way ... coz indy is currently riding a wave ... and this might take them past mediocrity that has been their second name the past season and especially offseason in that 41-0 loss to the jets. speaking of the jets - chad pennington is back to throwing .. but won't return till nov .. or so his team says. lets see how that goes ... the jets are expected to win games once he's back .. but that would hardly count for a playoff birth .. hopefully doesnt .. coz such teams dont deserve a playoff birth.

      i did not sit in dsp class today ... just didnt feel like it .. not that sitting helps my grade or anything ... so instead just went back to the library and read thru ch4 and ch5 from the vhdl book. not much ... but have to do it to score good in the quiz ... bcoz the quiz, u see, decides 40% of the final grade ... so thats where the treasure (40% of A) is ! hehe .. anyways ... while sitting in the library right now .. i was just getting to espn ... when this really shabby girl (i think she's a TA) showed up right beside me ... she had certainly not taken a bath ... and maybe not brushed her teeth (maybe for a few days !!!) ... yuk .. she was stinking bad ... and thats  the reason im in the NH EE lab right now .. writing this post ... onto espn now.

      day started out not so bad ... got up at 9:30 - 7hrs of sleep, less for me .. so got a nice cup of hot coffee which quickly stopped my sleep-walking ! got down to studies [engg mngt] soon after and till lunch time .. i tried and finished all there was to it .. a few things are remaining .. but i'll again have some time before the exam.  The Cowboys won last nite and though coach Parcells still gives an earful to players, the record shows that we lacked in coaching from the get go ... we are already 3-1 as against 5-11 for 3 previous seasons. so let's just praise the coach and let him continue in his ways ... as long as he gets the results we are seeing right now .. everything is just fine ... Big Test coming up this sunday at texas stadium ... Philly comes in .. if we can atleast compete and make the eagles work for the victory .. it will a job well done for  the cowboys and a boost for their growing confidence .. i will go as far as to predict a daring 3pt victory for the boys. everybody is expecting a loss .. but a tough one ..  There's this really stupid story on google news today about babies sleeping with their parents in the same bed face the risk of suffocation. i'm quoting this from www.wsoctv.com which published a report on the study. they say - 'A study published in this month's issue of the journal Pediatrics found that babies who are put to sleep in an adult bed face as much as a 40 times greater risk suffocation than babies who sleep in standard cribs.' i mean what they are saying is nothing really unique or not recent knowledge .. and do we really need to study such things ? it's like saying that the risk of burning is more when standing near a fire than away from it ... duh !! if you found this out now .. you wasted the money spent on such a study ... these are the ppl i'd call - oracles of the obvious. the world knows and they come out with a study that puts forth the same idea .. idiots.

      thanksgiving has come and gone ... it's never meant anything to us, hell we got to know what it is last year ... before that it was only some distant festive day celebrated in North America ... it still is ... but the difference is that it's not distant anymore .. we stay in the middle of it .. we try to participate by going out for shopping on black friday and im sure we would have eaten atleast some turkey had we been non-vegetarians :) ... but black friday is a really cool concept ... though it's tough to get up at 4am in the morning .. and go shopping in the horrible windy cold early early morning !!  we've been finding deals on good digital cameras ... and the plan was to go and buy one today morning ... but all the enthu just evaporated and we slept till 9:30 this morning .. hehe .. no digicam nothing ... we did go out for a token visit around noon .. but by then most people were leaving the stores rather than coming in .. hehe .. the only good that happened was money was kept safe in the bank .. haha ... anyways  got my project problem solved ... now it has new problems .. but i shud be able to work those out ... lets see how that goes .. the schedule for the next 2 weeks doesnt look tough ... but thats a superficial view ... i think i'll have my hands full for the 2 exams coming up .. what with the project still unfinished.

      the list of "things-to-do-once-i-get-a-job" just keeps growing and growing :) ... and the said job is not nearly in sight right now ... so i think i'll have to make one of those wishlists from now on so i can refer to one when i actually have the power to buy stuff.   I will probably buy a digital camera for my parents [facade; it's actually for myself !], and maybe some trivial buys during the shopping binge ... two reasons for the shopping ... one - im going to india .. taking something looks good .. makes the gift receiver feel thought of ... and two - im buying stuff for myself right now .. coz the prices are yearly lows in due to the thanksgiving/x'mas season.  the day is nice .. weather is great today .. but i must leave all .. get some lunch and head out to studies :(

I heard indiatimes.com is also getting into it … though the songs they will sell will be much cheaper than the 99c price std being followed here … lemme chk … but if I heard it correct, they will sell most of the songs for like 11Rs a song !!! that’s cheap compared to 99c.  Microsoft seems to have released it’s  markup language used for the Office Suite documents … this could be interesting in that I could now develop programs for personal use that utilize these schemas … and I could write office documents without using the Office Suite !! hmm … shud look into it   Ooh yes … before I forget … Kasparov beat the damned computer in the third game on Sunday … isn’t that just great ? kasparov shud have had a draw in the second game … but then we are humans and it is human to err right ? :) .. as long as the guy can win or draw the series … all is well   im hungry right now ... came out to help a friend with his project ... will go back .. get some grub and back to studies

      Australia beat NZ in rugby world cup for a berth in the finals... England beat France to meet up with australia ... england was expected i'll say ... but nz was supposed to beat aus. what happened there ? maybe i'll get to see the matches sometime on FSW ... that'll be great.  bobby jindal loses in louisiana - what happened here ? wasnt he supposed to win ? now they have a woman governor ... for the first time ever in LA it seems ... isnt that nice !   the 22nd list of the  urlLink top500  supercomputers [in terms of speed ie.,  # of calculations per sec] has been published .. guess what ? many universities in the USA have faster better supercomputers than anyone in India ... even among the two supercomputers from India that are ranked, one is privately owned !!! and the second one is PARAM based in Pune. Isnt this lack of money for development really frustrating ? i know ... this statement is quite shallow ... more money has to go to development of humans rather than machines and industries ... but seriously ... development of industries will cause development of humans ... im sure .. thats how USA has come to be what it is right ? maybe [mostly] im wrong ! fyi - Intel's supercomputer in india ranks 105 and PARAM ranks 258 ... among the other asian countries to have supercomputers ... i think china ranks highest at 14.  big day at the mall today ... shopping planned :) ... and btw .. you - you know who you are ... im seeing you tonite :)

      it's been a really cool, laid back day ... watched hindi tv in the morning ... all new songs and stuff ... it was fun .. then around 1:30 .. we [4 of us] went and got a haircut ... the ppl who work at my normal haircut place have changed ... and ive had 2 different females to cut my hair since .. the one this time was cute ... she has the potential to substitute the one who left ... hehe .. the other new one is just too fast for my taste ... this one .. she's younger .. and cuter ... and she cuts hair with great interest ... not as a job .. so i feel that much extra special about my haircut today :).  here's something interesting and maybe even wierd ! Google .. which had this programming contest called 'CodeJam' ... doesnt have any news about the winner and finalists ... or what happened with the contest or anything like that ... MercuryNews.com reports that Jimmy Mardell, 25, of Stockholm, Sweden won the contest finals and $10,000 as the prize ... he is also rumoured to have received a Google job offer ... the wierd thing is Google did not publicise this event at all .. they even hosted it on some other servers and domain ... the wierd thing is also that no indian is present in the winners ... or let's say no indian has been mentioned ... i had come to be proud of the programming skills of my fellow countrymen in recent years ... so many research activities and labs are headed by indians today ... its a bit surprising that none is in this contest ... i hope they atleast know about it.  india thrashed nz in the latest cricket match ... sachin and sehwag just smashed nz balling ... why cant india play like this all the time ? or atleast more than half the times?  why the inconsistency ??? why why ... ooh why ? anyways .. what do i know ? im just a fanatic !  cowboys play patriots tomm nite on espn ... its gonna be a big game for the boys .. and patriots are kinda riding high right now .. so we need to play our hearts out and get a win on this trip ... we cant afford a loss coz philly is right there on our tail .. just a game behind .. and chances are they'll win tomm.

      extra trying to improve a project will cause the project to start giving you problems ... understand your limits ... understand the requirements ... and dont tamper with the project beyond these limits ... once the project fulfills the requirements ... u stop working and get some testing done. ive been kind of "over-cooking " my vhdl project for a day or two now .. and it's gone bad now ... phht .. so much for all the effort to start out with.

      how is this idea for an innovative product ? a mind reader ... or atleast a brain wave interpreter ... something that will receive your brain waves ... understand them and convert em to proper english or the language of your choice for that matter. to start off it shud atleast give out simple words which describe your though ... or a combination of single words like when im lonely and thinking of home, family and friends ... the gadget shud say "lonely, family/friends" or something to suggest the same. it will be possible to make such a gadget once we've figured out if each distinct emotion of the human mind is decipherable based on what brain waves are sent out during the feeling of that emotion. it sounds pretty easy for the imagination and concept part of it .. but i have a pretty decent idea as to how difficult it will be ... there have been a lot of experiements on brain waves and making sense out of the results ... but i'm certain that the device i try to present hasnt been made as yet ... conceived - yes, i'll give you that ... probably as many times as the number of humans on the planet :)  whats with the online music stores now ? one [Apple] came out .. became kinda successful ... and all of a sudden you have so many following ... damn everything .. even Walmart is getting into the business ... maybe even Cnet .. who is rumoured to have bough mp3.com ... i tell you .. the US is such a faddist country .. i mean it's not like anyone didnt try to sell music online before Apple is it ? but now that this business model has been successful for some time .. everyone wants to follow ! it's such a stupid thing .. and somehow it's more evident in the US.  my roomies have this project in one of their classes, where they have to come up with an innovative idea for a product ... something which can be produced and is applicable to one of safety, everyday use or transportation fields .... hehe .. for the past 2 days .. the house has been a brain-storming room ... everyone comes up with ideas ... we laugh at the ideas and none are pursued ... we've come up with everything from modern automatic dumpsters to heated shoes for snowy winters ... from tubelight fixtures to vehicle attachments ... the most high tech to the most stupid ideas ever thought maybe ... well i'll take back the most stupid part ... coz all the ideas made some sense in the first place.  other than all this ... today morning has been filled with some nice articles ... and good cartoons at ziggy and garfield ! i just love the two ... have i said that before ? well someone must have guess based on the links being present.

      haha ... amazing morning this has been ... i started out with the intention of sitting in class for another boring hour and half ... only to reach the class room and find exactly two students sitting in there ... mind you the class size is about 75+ and shows up full strength for exams or such ... hehe .. but class .. well .. it's so boring .. so useless ... u get the drift ... i bunked !  since then ive been online ... did some work for a friend ... helped on his project for a common class we have .. and then .. surfing it was ! :) ... lots of interesting sites today...  urlLink Time Magazine Great Inventions 2003  lists inventions in various fields. some are simply awesome ... some are funny .. and some could really go place if put to proper use. do chk it out ..   and then i saw the  urlLink microsoft documentation  of all the ports that microsoft services use ... hehe .. not really useful right now .. but it's really nice to have this listing when u write networking code or want to run firewalls and dont know what ports to leave open for imp. services ... hehe could also help you figure out what microsoft service was used to hack into your system [just in case - i know it's unfortunate .. and may your system be never hacked].   other than that ... there was this - spywareinfo.com ... engaging site about how the many corporations are out to rob you of your well earned money and how sneaky they get to do so ... hehe ... im not exactly in alignment with all the views ... but it does present a pretty convincing picture of the situations it aims to tackle ... certainly worth a look.  other than the surfing .. the morning's been almost useless ... so maybe i shud get to some work now !

      damn ! didnt realize how fast this weekend went... friend was here and time was spent with him ... we ate outside on sat and went bowling and watched movies ... it was entertainment weekend anyways ... me having just finished my exams last week ... but the expenses may have been enough to keep me from anything more atleast in nov. .. the thing is .. i dont earn right now .. so i have to live off what i already have ... and conserve it so as to not run out of money .. sad situation, but quite real all the same. anyways .. so trip to houston postponed to dec.   i was thinking about what to take home for parents when i go ... they havent really suggested anything .. but i know they'll feel nice if i take something along ... it's not called satisfaction ... it's some other feeling which i fail to verbalize [is verbalize a word ? Yes it is .. i just checked .. why the hell did i need to chk that ?] ... but maybe i'll end up taking some chocolates along or something ... i hate being conventional ... but cant think of anything else to do ...  work week starts tomm morning ... and will have to look into the studies for tomm's quiz .. lets see how that goes.

      there are so many things about which u know just superficially ... and when u think abt it .. u dont know much ... hehe .. uve just heard the words and never made sense out of it ! anyways ... there are many such things for me ... i can confidently discuss these things without the slightest clue abt the latest development in that area .. and yet seem like a knowledgable person ! the success of this characteristic of mine comes from two things - a) My confidence while presenting my point and b) i know the person im talking to doesnt know enough to differentiate among a pretender like me and the real thing ! hehe .. it also depends on how much im in touch with the world and the fields of discussion.  anywho .. the weather here kinda sucks today ... it's been dark grey for like more than 2 days now .. the lights outside our homes [photo-dependant switching] have been on continuously for all of that period .. it's that dark .. and to top it .. it's been raining since early this morning .. it's gotten excessively cold all of a sudden .. the current temp is 6&degC and looks like no sunshine till monday ... i dont feel like doing anything in such weather ... it drains me of any small hint of enthusiasm and energy i have alloted for the day and i just sit back and enjoy "procrastination specialities" like watching tv, playing games on the computer, chatting or even sleeping for that matter ! hehe ..   saw matrix revolutions [the end of the trilogy] .. not the highly engrossing movie i was expecting it to be ... at times i was thinking of other things apart from the movie .. but all the same i liked it ... many a times in this part .. i ended up thinking of hindu mythology and even history at times .. and how similar the story of matrix is to those stories of hindu gods overcoming the villians or fighting for the balance of the system ! right ? i mean thats what hindu mythology and history is all about ... tolerate as long as you can and fight to the fullest when you cant tolerate anymore ! well .. to each his own .. and this is to me :) ... if u decide to watch the movie from a 'movie' point of view and not analyze the story line ... it's an awesome movie .. with some amazing animation/graphics .. and some really cool fighting scenes .. i liked the one where the humans get ready in their robot fighters with guns et al ! wow ! i just liked the possibility of having such a fighting machine actually being used in war ! haha .. can u imagine such a robot being used in the latest american excursion in iraq .. wow .. now that wud have been something ! overall a good movie .. and the trilogy ends.. leaves a lot of questions unanswered .. but then thats how most things end up when trying to answer "why are we here?" ..  other than all that .. well .. life goes on .. a friend expected today .. i was hoping the weather would be better .. but doesnt look like it anymore ... i just hope he brings along the requisite clothing for this weather ..  heyyy ! I almost forgot the big news ... i made a 98.5 on the VHDL exam ... the one which was later .. the one which i studied less for ... the one where im expecting an A .. this bodes well for the final grade .. now i have to concentrate on the project ... as for other subjects ... im hoping i can make a B in DSP and an A in Engg Mngt... not too difficult .. but u can never say .. atleast in my case ! my scoring patterns have always been erratic ... now isnt that sad !

      it's 11&degC here right now and nite time low is supposed to be 8&degC ... not really record lows for this time of the year .. but it's kinda without notice you know ... just yesterday it was a nice a sunny 26&degC and today it has come to this ... by the time weekend starts it'll improve .. so not too bad .. but now we've gotto get ready for the winter.  school has gone ahead and approved fee increases ... so will have to pay that in spring ! things change on when i want to finish my education now ... most likely i will make some decisions in my home trip this december.

      i was almost to the point of being sore all over yesterday due to the 3rd successive bowling evening .. but the scores i piled up last nite somehow softened it a bit ... hehe .. i made 147, 122, 119 and two more score which went in the descending order ... i know .. nothing to boast abt .. but for me - a below average player - these scores sound great ... i had 4 strikes in a row during the 147 game ... which felt amazing ...  now if i could just be consistent ... i could go above 160 !! thats the next objective if i live thru the sore right forearm and left inner thigh ! am i doing something wrong ? i mean physically my bowling must be flawed coz otherwise i dont think it shud pain at all .. right ?  something's wrong with the  urlLink horoscopes@yahoo  ... i have got 2 wierd daily horoscopes in a row ... i mean no relation at all .. till now i used to get something which i cud make sense of .. atleast one line .. just take a look what it says today -  "Short journeys or visits in your near neighborhood could catapult you into rather negative situations, dear Capricorn, so it's best to stay close to home if you can. An angry letter or phone call from a woman could put you into a rather shaky mood. Days like this are best for keeping to yourself and throwing your energies into taking care of whatever you're working on right now, dear Capricorn. This is not a day to socialize!"  hehe ... i mean im quite a loner - almost asocial - in the first place ... and im stuck here at the univ in most cases ... i cant go out ... and who the hell is gonna be angry and call me !!! more so a woman ??? no way .. that last line says .. "not a day to socialize " ... hehe .. for me .. no day is meant for socializing ..   anyways .. this week looks really dull .. till the weekend anyways .. rain is forecast and it's all dark and cloudy outside with the temperature dipping by the hour .. weekend brings a friend [school chum] and sunshine along .. hope it's good.

      wow ! haha .. my college football predictions have almost blown up in my face !!! just shows what i know of national college football .. though i predicted correctly the wins for Big 12 leaders texas and oklahoma ... both got huge wins over ranked opponents .. but whats happened with miami ... man !!! i dont think anyone expected this kind of a scoreline .. 4th Q still to go .. so cant say .. but the way things look .. it's tough going for miami.  today was unexpectedly enjoyable .. hehe .. got up real late in the morning ... like 10:15am or thereabouts. expected to laze around thru the day. then my roomie said he's going to this auto show ... all kinds of cars for test drives for free :) .. amazing .. i drove a corvette and a hummer ... damn cool ! day spent well.

      with my camera coming tomm and i having discovered [for myself] photofriday some time ago ... it was but natural that i would feel like joining .. but maybe that wont happen so soon ... maybe i'll just shoot some pictures around campus before i hand over the camera to dad ... it's been bought for him anyways ... but photography chances wont be any less as i'll bring back my Minolta SLR back from india ... lets see how that goes ... my enthu abt this topic is pretty high right now ... my roomie is very much into it ... so he keeps me going !  india is a healthy 108/2 at lunch .. shud win .. though u can never predict ... it hasnt happened all that many times before you know ... so we [indians] dont know what its like ... this is sure one of those times when we can experience first hand [its happening during our lifetime] a test match victory on australian side which is really good .. coz u c .. a win against some weak australian club wont have done the same thing for me .. so this counts .. BIG TIME !!! we [indian cricket team] are making history .. snapping australia's home winning streak of the past 7-8 years i think .. way to go ... now just hang in there and the win is all yours

      Has this ever happened to you – You are sitting on a chair doing something … maybe sitting at your desk or computer … and someone comes to talk to you … and when you look up at the person … your eyes go straight to their nostril and this visible sized blob [I don’t know what else to call it !] of mucus … how do u describe the feeling you get when this happens ? how do u let the person know about the situation ? mining for that treasure in public isn’t the best way to go about it for the person concerned .. and there’s no decent way I can think of to tell the person … or is there ? haha .. this has happened with me a lot of times … and everytime im distracted from what the person is saying … it’s just hilarious at times but there’s no way of laughing without hurting the person… hehe .. anyways   So … seen the score ? haha .. India has aus in control .. and we see a win in sights … wow .. and I was so happy to know that we weren’t losing this test !! hehe .. a draw would have been almost a win for us .. but not now … this is different now … we have a very very good chance of showing our true colors ! or lets say exposing the Australian arrogance about nothing .. the main thing is .. we’ve done most of the things without sachu dearest … the Indian team has finally come of age !

      This is cool … I wanted to write my blog on a nice plain sheet today … there’s so much to write that I thought having a blank sheet would help me put in everything … but I don’t write on paper and very much prefer to key in my entries … so I thought I’d write in notepad … and then came this idea … why not write in WORD with a full screen view … I only see the sheet im writing on … nothing else … pretty pleasing right now .. and oddly for no specific reason.  Ok … first off … roomies out to India .. one already there … two in flight. One will stop over before eventually getting to India while the other one goes straight to Mumbai. Fun .. went to the airport to drop one of em today .. and that took up the morning … afternoon was taken by the sumptuous lunch we prepared and the sleep that it induced … we made moong bhaji from some age old mix that would have stunk up the closet otherwise. We also had last nites rajma and made some fresh rice … which was really nice. The sleep was obvious and we only woke up coz bro dearest called .. hehe .. if the phone hadn’t rung then … we would have surely slept on till much later … in a way it was good that he called … we talked about his upcoming trip here … and planned a few things … still the picture seems unclear … I haven’t planned out much … things will work out properly … that’s not a problem … but all my enthusiasm for optimization of my decisions is somehow totally absent … but still I wont take it as it comes … I’ll make the decisions … and follow thru … and c to it that bro doesn’t have any problems on his vacation .. he shud enjoy all he can .. coz he’s gotto go back and work … unlike myself … hehe .. im headed home for a month ! Work scheduled for Tuesday 9:00 am … lets see how that goes … shud be like anything else … coz there would be a lot to learn and I want to personally finish it off asap … so I can use up the remaining time with bro.  I haven’t really kept up this place in a while … various reasons … it started out with the exams .. there was a lot to study and that kinda sapped a lot of energy and enthu … then it was all about shopping and packing for roomies and going to the airport and what not ! I even attended engineering graduation walk yesterday, which was really nice … impressed me and im going to take a walk when I graduate for sure … if not for anything else .. just for the sheer feeling of having achieved it finally … after all the troubles … not that im worse off than others … ive had it fairly easy too … but then .. any hurdles in the way have to be jumped over … and this sem seems to be the “break-away” sem for me … chances of good grades are pretty decent … thought the picture will be much clear [as clear as possible] only on wed.  Now its only me and one roomie at home … all the house to ourselves … just 4 more days coz then he’ll go to his brother’s place and bro will be here ..  and we’ll be traveling to Houston and surrounding places .. lets see how that goes. Days suddenly have become a bit slower to pass than during exam times … it’s nice how days go by faster when you are busy all the time doing something or thinking about something … hehe .. today I went to the airport .. and slept in the afternoon … and it seems like the day has been going on and on … are these the mysteries of the mind or are there valid theses about how the mind plays us ?  Anyways … how about the capture of saddam huh ? the guy hid successfully for so long from a braggadocious US Army … and he’s pretty old no less … bugger wont help the coalition anyways … this is just interesting coz it’s whats going on in the world right now … capture of saddam is world headlines … nothing less … and then we have the Indian headlines … India playing Australia in Adelaide … wow .. the ausies have batted really well in both the tests … but India has answered pretty much perfectly .. how would you describe this situation ? are both the sides weak at bowling ? or too good at batting ? or is Indian bowling pretty much at it’s age old normal level [getting beat all the time] and Indian batting is showing that aussie bowlers aren’t all that good either ? whatever the case … it’s really great to see Indians doing well out there ..  I’ll be online again later … this shud do it for now .. time for dinner … and there’s a few buggers in this half empty computer hall who don’t have the public etiquettes and are talking loudly on their phones … which is disturbing me .. time to go home anyways.

      wow ! no entry since the 8th !! how'd that happen ? .. well .. thats simple .. ive had exams .. so been studying .. and it's kinda distracting if i sit and write in here .. i dont know why ... also .. didnt have much to write !! but now ...    Exams DONE !!    hehe ... today morning was the last one and it went kind well .. i was hoping i'd get a favourable paper and all the questions were the ones i expected ... [most of those who gave the exam expected the same questions !] and so it was a breeze though i took more time than expected ... i thought i'd be out of there in 30 min ... but i actually sat and solved a couple of questions before writing the answer .. which took some more time ... finally got out in an hour ... the test according to me shud fetch me more than 90 ... but then .. i can never say .. so i'll wait for the result. If i do happen to get more than 95 on this test ... chances are i'll make an A .. which is an amazing amazing recovery for this particular subject ... not too bad after what happened in the 1st exam.  anyways ... so now that all the exams are done ... im free for the weekend .. and dont know what to do ! will be going out right now ... for some shopping ... lets see what comes home :)

      For the past few years ive known software programming in various languages. all of them present you with the feature of "step running" your code... so you can easily point out the line of code thats either causing problems or points out a certain time and place in the code when you want something to happen ... basically go step by step. right ?  well there's generally another feature ... where you put in breakpoints in the code ... and then run the code normally ... when the breakpoint occurs or the specific condition is met ... the program will suspend run and wait for you to start it up again after you've observed what you need to ...   well ive been telling you all that coz i want the same facility in life ! hows that ? imagine ... the code to my life has already been written. there's imp outputs manifested as achievement milestones in the journey of my life ... what if i could step run it ? what if i could control and observe and analyze every step of the code before it actually happened ? and even if i analyzed it wrong .. i could instantly go back and correct it ?  what if i could "Run to Cursor" [as in Visual Studio] to any line of code in my life [not necessarily the past] .. wouldnt that be exciting ? given that this was possible ... i know which line of code i would choose to run to ... :) .. but you know what ? even in that eventuality ... the program will run at it's own predetermined pace ... it wont run faster than programmed just to get to the end point ... would it ! just a what if ! :)  morbid thoughts are commonplace in my head ... and though this is not one of them .. the "thought express" was certainly running wildly in that direction ... so i halted it midway .. better that than the morbid thoughts .. what say ?  other than all this .. life is quite sweet right now .. all studies are well planned out .. and i'll be going to india soon ... though not before spending some time with bro dearest. ive also got the job training to handle .. hope that goes well.

       urlLink check out this article  about introverts ... pretty good .. though it kind of states the case in a hyped manner .. all that talk about introverts being opressed .. hehe ! where did the author see that ? im amused by the extroverts over introverts angle .. but some of the things about introverts are true ... and made me smile in agreement .. u will too . . if u have any idea of who introverts are and why they do the things they do .. :)  ... im not sure how long the article will stay there .. so if it's suddenly a dead link .. im not responsible ! [ i have no clue why ive said the last sentence]

      11:18 AM 12/4/2003 there's so much knowledge to spread ... so many new things that have come to my attention this morning  ..   first off - the comics links in the left hand side column arent working ... seems yahoo has changed the way it references the latest publication of the comic strips and the links that i have no longer have any utility ... so they are going .. till i can find a way to reference the latest strip again ..  second - though this is more imp .... BJP is winning big in the state elections across 4 states in india .. i dont know the states that are having the elections .. but these states send out 72 MPs to delhi and so winning is very important .. moreover Congress was ruling these states and it's come as a big big shock to them ... Go BJP !! you are doing a good job ...   and now we come to the perennial sob story - India couldnt help itself to a strong start in the first test at the Gabba against Australia ... it's a good pitch .. tough to bat on and still Aus almost cruised to 262/2 ... i mean how insulting is that to our bowlers ? cant even get more than 2 wickets in a whole day ? on a bowler friendly pitch ?? im hoping they can do much better over the course of this series .. like eminem says - failure's not an option ! and i say draws are perfectly fine :) .. anything as long as we dont lose .. right ?  i know i said there's a lot going on ... but for now this is enough ..

      nice photo shoot today in the early evening ... went around campus and took some nice pictures of the campus ... it was more of the artistic and beautiful pictures than what could be termed as a campus tour :) ... all the buildings were covered .. but attention was also paid to the aesthetics of every frame ... i was pretty pleased with the effort and the whole proceedings ... and im very eager to know how the photos turn out .. wont get em back till monday .. so thats a drag.  not much of studying today .. so will have to catch up on Engg Mngt tomm ... lets see how that goes ... but one thing im certain of ... im going home and sleeping ... due to staying up till 2 every morning .. my eyes and forehead is paining .. or so i think ... maybe sleeping earlier will help

      how did this happen ? i havent written in here since friday !! ok .. so ive been a bit  inconsistent this past week in putting up entries ... not much of an issue .. though i wonder if that happened coz i didnt have anything to write or i was just bored of writing !  so .. i had this really wierd dream this morning .. it was almost a nightmare .. i actually woke up scared [just a bit!] ... the dream was that .. i was bound to my bed ... by some unknown, invisible force .. and i had this sudden and bad case of [let me chk the spelling here] diarrhaea ... can u even imagine that ? my stomach/intestine is making wierd noises ... i _have_ to go use the loo and i cant move from my bed ... and then i lose control .. and it happens in bed .. and continues for like 5-10 min .. before i can move and go to the toilet ... damn .. all my bed is soiled ... and ive been laying there in that waste for all that time ... and now i go to the toilet ... im in my current apt .. and i see my roomie sitting on his desktop .. working ... early up in the morning .. thats not such a rare site .. so i dont mind .. but what surprises me is that i have nothing on .. no clothes i mean ... atleast nothing below .. only a nite-shirt maybe .. haha .. and this the point when i had enough and woke up .. it was 7am ... and i might have been sweating !! haha ... i did find some sleep later ... but this was scary !!! is there any meaning to this dream ? there sure is ... i just need to take it in the proper context .. just the other day i saw this software that helps you analyze and make sense of your dreams .. hehe .. how great is that .. what i make of it is im shit scared of not doing good in tonite's exam ... lets hope this dream doesnt ever ever come true.  hey ! a good news ... i got a job on campus today .. i'll be working in the bookstore ... i start training in dec .. and hopefully my actual job will start in jan .. when i get back .. this is a really cool development .. just goes to show that God has my back covered ..   hehe .. the mention of God reminds me ... we went to the temple this weekend .. where in we saw this regular sticker of Hanuman .. and on it in the top right corner were the words "Hum hai, to kya Gam hai" ... hahaha ... ridiculous .. never have i seen a cheaper sticker of any Hindu God than this one .. i mean how mortal can u make a God ? certainly not more than this ...

      i havent done anything worthwhile today ... except the following - - gotten to know that i can graduate .. there was a slight problem which my advisor solved before i could tell him what the problem was ! thank you dear texan-to-the-core ... that would be my advisor .. and the explanation for his name is the topic of another entry some other time - attended class without much growth in knowledge .. sometimes you have to drudge along with whatever's going on just in the hope that at some point down the line u'll learn something ... today's class was just one of those where though the professor is interesting ... what he was teaching was just not important ... - got some forms processed ... by me that is ! i completed [almost] the graduation form and the program of work ... i also got some information abt the OPT ... which will be duly processed over the weekend ..  which reminds me .. the weekend has started !! isnt that cool .. 4 days of classes .. and now the weekend starts ,.. though there's much to be done anyways .. but all the same .. expecting a cousin to show up on Sat. .. that shud be fun

      it's been an ok day ... i had this class in the morning ... and based on what went on in the class .. i was cursing myself at not having kept some of my notes from a class i took last spring ... im such an ass ... darn .. anyways .. the good thing is atleast i know what book to use and whats going on ... hehe .. the other classes ive taken this sem have kept me clueless abt whats happening ! anyways .. i met with the prof later .. and it was nice to have met him .. im taking 2 of his classes this sem and it's really imp that i make a good grade .. well see .. the categories for grades are so clear cut here at UTA -  A - good, B - bad, C - ugly, anything else - super ugly ...  there's nothing in between ... like the "decent" or " i'll be fine " category ... its tough for average guys like me .. anyways .. so looks like this prof will help out once in a while .. so i gotto work for his classes ... as for the other one .. i have two buddies who will hopefully pull me along with them to a passing grade ... i have my priorities straight .. hehe :) .. im just kidding ..  other than the class and all .. i gave a practice test for the Spoken English Assessment test ... gave as in went thru the practice test .. didnt really speak out the answers .. which was the point of the exercise ... but the test kinda brought into daylight my inability to verbalize things easily ... i mean i dont know if i was nervous or i just didnt want to answer such simple questions .. or maybe it was the fact that i was talking to a tape recorder ... who knows ! the test almost freaked me out ... but i'll get it done .. like someone must have said sometime [if not .. im saying it here and now] -  It's not about how much you know , its about how much you get done  ... so im passing the SEA ... who cares abt any other result.  I spent some time playing scrabble with roomie ... imagine !! scrabble .. hehe .. how long has it been since you played it ? fun .. isnt it ? i played after many many years ... atleast 10 im sure ... but i dont remember the last time i played [thats why 10 for sure]  ... and winning or losing wasnt the point of the game .. for me .. it was all abt the enjoyment of making words and competing ... hehe .. it was really entertaining .. songs playing in the background .. and me thinking of all the words i can make with the given letters ... that brings to mind this thought - do all the words starting with the letter 'q' have the letter 'u' in second place ? think abt it ... and let me know if you know of a word that isnt so .. there has to be atleast one word like that .. u would think .. exception to the rule .. etc etc

      it's become so cold so suddenly ... i mean yesterday the high was 72F ... which is like 22C .. so nice and pleasant ... and today it's not even 5C ... they are saying that a cold front has headed this way ... and its been so cold there's been snow in lubbock and parts of oklahoma ... hope we dont have any snow here ...  the thing is i dont hate snow ... but unlike rain i dont really see anything positive out of it ... just plain monotonous white all over ... so dull ..  anyways .. first glimpse of two classes today .. one more coming tomm ... hopefully i'll study more and seriously coz my first impression of both the classes is that they are tough ... the third one wont be any different ... so i'll have lots of work ..  other than that i scheduled a spoken english test for myself .. it's one of the graduation requirements .. that shud be done this friday .. after which i will fill up the program of work and file for graduation with the Graduate school ... im hoping things go smoothely ... and if not anything else ... the least im expecting is to complete everything ... however hard it may be ..

      why do i prefer to go to places that are less crowded ? why do i patronize places that not many people know about ? why is it an urge for me to associate myself to places which arent really popular ? so i can call them my own ?? or maybe have the peace and quiet that i go there for ? and not the chaos that is invariably the order of places more populated ? i was reading this article on the Sundance film festival ... and it says somewhere in there ... that "Sundance is at its capacity - too many people know abt it now " ... and that was similar to what i thought abt pavas during my recent trip there ... though the number of people i actually saw there was decent and low, i thought to myself and to my mother (verbalized my thoughts !) that once they start calling it "shree kshetra pavas" .. thats when i'd stop going ... coz thats when lots more people would know abt it than necessary ...   does this just show that i like myself to be eclectic ? so selective abt my taste of the place of worship i visit ? i dont know for now ... but i'll find out for sure ... maybe im just not ready to accept the answer as it is right now .

      it's been a while since i have said anything in here ... ive spent the last one month back home in india ... one beautiful month spent with family and friends ... enjoying the company of people i love ... and enjoying the environs (though polluted and crowded) of the city that saw me grow to be what i am today .. its been nice ... ive kinda recharged myself ... im ready to go ... another sem and job searching ... lets see how that goes ..  reviewing the trip - i reached india pretty close to the new year ... started meeting people and attending programs the day i reached .. new year was the dullest it has been in the past few years .. i was home with my parents and grandma (mom's mom) ... this in no way implies that they made it boring ... but in general .. i slept at 11 ... maybe the reason was fatigue ... anyways ... it was a welcome change from what has been the routine for new year ... the 3 weeks after that were really nice ... i spent time with relatives ... spent my birthday with them ... and my cousin decided to get married ... and i travelled to nearby places ... and what not !! but all in all .. there was this feeling of wanting to get back ... a kind of impatience to get working again ... get started with the Spring sem .. so i could finish it at the earliest and maybe land a decent job somewhere ... but then .. everything has a place on the timeline ... and there's no way im graduating before May ... so there i was .. enjoying every minute i spent in my hometown with my people ... relaxed .. no worries .. no chores .. just eat good (home-cooked) food ... and catch up on sleep ..   ive missed out on this place and the blogs that i read regularly ... so maybe some catching up is in order ... but lets see how that goes ... some new links will be coming in here soon ... i have rekindled my interest in the indian stock market and "technical analysis" intrigues me no end these days ... im trying to learn more abt the same .. and maybe test my predictions of the market so maybe i can be a good player of the market some day .... it's a really good investment and money increasing tool if u make informed decisions on known risks ... all u need is sane share brokers and some knowledge of whats going on .. anyways .. im just a kid starting out ... there've been so many kings of the market who have lost it all in one day ...  now its back to school and work (school related ! i dont work otherwise) ... it's nice to be back here ... excited abt the subjects ive chosen and hope to get decent grades out of this semester ... and graduate at the end of it .. lets hope im on the right track

      The wierdest thing happened right now ... i was chking my mailbox like i usually do ... going thru the bulk mail [spam] to see if there was any non-spam in there ... and there was lightening outside somewhere ... and as if on cue .. both the open windows on my desktop closed ... haha ! poof .. it seemed like the lightening caused it ! i dont know how .. but its a strange coincidence .. o btw .. its been raining since early morning .. so timely and as predicted by weathermen around here.  One more thing before i forget .. remember Martin Yan of ' Yan Can Cook ' ? He made cooking so interesting ... i loved his way of cooking ... the flat big knives .. and his unique english ... his show was real fun .. his show used to be syndicated on Star Plus in India in the late 90's ... well .. i saw him on PBS yesterday and thought .. i'd love to have a video or dvd collection of his programs ... so maybe i'll just go thru amazon today and find out if there's anything out there.

      again .. damn it !! so much has happened ... out of which a few things will be ommitted for privacy reasons ... but still so much to write !! lets start from the morning .. its been really cold [by texas standards] the past two days ... and it was like a punishment to me personally from nature .. hehe .. let me give some background here ... last week .. there were a couple of days when the weather was simply gorgeous ... beaut ! ... it was warm and sunny and made me feel like i wanted to go out for a hike .. or a drive .. or something of the sort .. u know .. and one morning i felt ... Spring is here !! even though i know that winter and rain lasts till atleast the start of march or even further at times  ... but i was stubborn :) .. and it might have slipped my thoughts that "winter was _gone _" .. hehe .. and now i think nature has punished me for even thinking that winter was gone ... it's rained here for 2 days in a row .. and rained longhorns [as i said in an earlier post] .. and then it was cold and cloudy ... and horrible in short .. so ! i think nature punished me for thinking this way ... blah !! whatever ..  going on ... there was this dull class i attended this morning .. and when i got out onto the pavement ... i saw the SAE people here at my univ doing "show runs" on the road ... right outside the engg bldg :) .. that was a treat .. the car was so small .. and light .. and for all i know it was going atleast 100mph at times ... it was a short patch of road .. with people standing on both sides of the road .. so im sure the driver wasnt going anywhere near the best ... but i could see the possibilities ... i could feel the power .. and there i was .. watching SAE and imagining what F1 must feel like .. and my resolution to watch a race strengthened many folds ... asap :)  real cool thing just happened right now ... i got a reminder from my yahoo calendar on a stock that i needed to watch :) ... and im gonna act on it now ..

      i come here with so much to write ... i mean i am always noting down things in my mind for future blogging .. and whenever the time comes .. all im left with to talk is the weather and school .. damn .. anyways .. i think i'll write about the current passions of mine .. hehe ..  - I'm into stocks big time right now .. it takes up atleast 2 hours a day of mine .. im just learning the ropes though .. no actual investing .. that , i think, will have to wait for atleast the next year or two .. not unless a steady income starts and im settled with a nice apartment and a good car (thats the new Mazda 3 - 5 door for now !) .. till then learning abt stocks is the chosen path   - Photography ... though i cant say im into it as much as i'd like to ... i dont have a camera at hand .. no buying power if i decide to get a decent one and no time to go shoot some photos if i do get my hands on a camera ... right now though im infatuated by all the different types of photography and the requisite equipment .. it's so amazing what today's digital cameras offer  - Sherlock Holmes ... the stories kinda inspire me .. hehe .. and i get into this detective mode at times .. without any need what-so-ever ! and im trying to analyze things and put facts together to make a decent conclusion (which is a rarity) ..  im getting the hang of it. what do u expect when im reading it for the second time !  anyways .. more later .. it's gonna rain longhorns (haha .. hows the use of local animals instead of the conventional cats and dogs !) around here in a short while and it's good i get to stay home while the clouds decide to burst ... i hope i can go home and find something nice to eat and drink .. hot coffee would do just fine ... thank you.  about the exam - well i didnt do as bad as i expected ... i thought i wouldnt be able to solve even one question .. finally though i think i did ok on 1 question ... i solved the paper in my usual ambiguous manner .. constantly doubting the answers i came up with .. and would you believe it was an "open-book open-notes" test ! the less said the better  ... im hoping things will only improve from here on.

      I'm so enthused this morning ... a lot more than usual .. it's a rare event ... but it's here all the same .. and the reason is it's Spring !! hehe .. the leaves havent started growing back .. i dont see any more than the normal bird sightings .. i dont see people in spring clothes .. and it's just been a week since it last snowed .. but still ..  it's spring :) .. the weather has been intoxicating the past 2 days ... the highs have been around 65 and a cool breeze has been sweeping the fallen dry leaves off the ground .. makes you feel like going out for camping .. or in general a trip to a nearby lake .. or something of the sort .. get out .. enjoy the nature ... u know what i mean !  and instead im stuck at the univ .. studying for the upcoming exam and finishing my homework for other classes .. waiting for spring break so i can get out of here for sometime atleast. anyways .. to celebrate this new found enthusiasm im out today in denim shorts ... boy it's good to be outside !

      well .. i started out thinking i'd simply edit the earlier entry abt my weekend rather than putting in a new one ... but then thought  .. what the heck ! .. so anyhow .. it snowed big time friday nite and well into saturday morning ... i think it was lightly snowing even late on saturday morning .. the snow flakes .. nice and soft covered all the surroundings in pure white .. all the cars were covered in snow and looked like snow sculptures except for the black tires which seemed to be stuck on ... it felt as though time was still and we would continue for eternity in this dull monotonous white world ! instead fortunately the sun came out .. and lapped up all the snow there was .. small streams of water flowing along the sidewalks was all that was left of the snow that came over in a flash ... we had seen it all through ... we were stuck on the freeway while it started to snow .. and we were at home when it melted .. it was fun while it lasted .. coz it lasted only a day .. snow in arlington is rare .. and the past two years we've had plenty ... it snows in arlington like once a year and they could very well name a day after the event .. like "Snow Day" ... every second friday/third monday of February ... haha .. might as well have a law that says the day will be a holiday in arlington .. not a bad idea i'd say ..  anyways ... ive enjoyed more than most other weekends since i came back .. we were invited to dinner by two extremely homely, gracious and enjoyable couples .. both being brothers of two of my roommates. .. food was especially good ... coz women were cooking ! hehe ... we all know our cooking skills pale compared to those of women .. anyways ... it's been a wonderful weekend .. i even finished my homework on time .. and am well settled in 2 of the 3 courses ... the 3rd one im still tackling ... im forming strategies as to how to score in the subject but even that is tough .. anywho ! lets take it as it comes ...

      i have serious doubts abt how im going to complete these courses ... i have significant problems in understanding what the professor says and chances are i'm dumb if i dont understand it. other people in class seem to have no problem !! how am i going to get out of this mess ??? and it's not like it's a one time exam or something ... this is going to continue every week as he keeps on giving homeworks ... how the hell am i supposed to do the homework if ive not understood the class properly ! i must figure it out ... finally all thats left for me to do is turn in my work as it is ... it might not be what he wanted .. but thats all ive been able to do ! whatever ... i gotto face it ... be confident for what i can do ..rather than scared that i cant do something

      Nature has the craziest ways to fool you ... it was so nice this morning ... bright and sunny ... after days of dark clouds and rain .. so seeing this .. is it wrong to assume that it would be warm too ? well .. as my experience proves .. YES ! hehe .. i assumed the same and got out in a half sleeves shirt .. ready to enjoy the warmth of the day ... only to find out that it was 35&degF outside  and the wind blowing at 20mph ... haha .. it was bloody freezing [thats freezing where i am] ... i was almost crying bcoz of the cold wind by the time i reached the lab.

      Ive been so damn busy with the class work off late … hehe … as in the past 2 days … and it hasn’t stopped .. I still have things to take care of and overall this may turn out to be the busiest semester till now … looks like time will fly … im just hoping that all this hard work comes to fruition in the form of a decent job .. that’s all im looking for… isn’t that a simple desire ? maybe god can help me here …  Yesterday while talking to my prof, I came to know (rather unfortunately) that he smells bad … real bad … he reminded me of a prof we had back home in college … who used to smell bad too. I invariably compared the two of them … and where today I respect this chap for what he knows (regardless of his body odour problems) , I used to dislike the other chap for his body odor … and now I feel maybe it was also bcoz he didn’t know a lot … or maybe Im comparing the degree the two of them have …. Oh damn it .. who cares .. both have a problem .. and it sucks.  Ive been eating pizza for more than 24hrs now … ive had pizza for like 5 successive times … and I don’t like it as much anymore …

      This IEEE Xplore website isnt opening for some reason. So I drifted to creative writing [which is my hobby on one-off ocassions like this]. I found  urlLink this website , where they give out prompts for amateur writers like me. I was just looking thru the prompts when i found this one that made me feel like writing. It's a tough thing to write abt anything on the spur of the moment and thats just the reason i chose this assignment. I've dreamt abt such a place for some time now. anyways ... here goes :)  My ideal place –   It’s quite easy to put down on paper my idea of a perfect place. I’ve thought about it a thousand times before and it’s pretty simplistic to start out with though over the course of this exercise it may turn out to be nicely decked out.  Any description of my ideal place has to start with the word “seclusion”. Isolated and in the arms of nature is how my dream destination would be. It would be well connected to all the important places outside that area. High altitude and moderate rainfall would characterize the place. A beautiful sunrise and sunset would be routine. Flora and fauna of the area would be splendid. A pond with an adjacent picnic place would sit in some small area of my property. The place would have a couple of horse trails through the thickets.  The residence would be a diminutive bungalow made out of stone. ‘Minimalist’ would fully describe my style of decoration. A far cry from ornate, it would be simplistic and natural. A computer with a broadband internet connection would be a must. A TV and phone connection would be important too. My place would have neat little kitchen gardens where I’d grow all my favorite foods. My computer would allow me to work in sunlight. Work hours during the sunrise and sunset period would be my favorite. The place would have a huge library and a big, fully equipped kitchen. A photography lab somewhere around would be quite handy too.   The most important aspect in my ideal place is its physical isolation from the rest of the world while it still would give me the connectivity to social life via networking gadgets invented by man, namely the phone, the computer, the TV and a car. The peace and quiet of the country side would please me no end. The hustle and bustle of the city would vanish and the pleasant chirping of birds and faint sounds of a flowing river somewhere nearby would be all that would remain.  Some day, it may come to be that I will be bored of staying in this place, but till then this is my ‘ideal place’. Come to think of it, the only place I would go to if this gets boring would be the Himalayas. I could meditate and lead a solitary life until God deems it fit for me to leave Earth.

      awesome  urlLink bulletin at cricinfo.com  describing india and in particular sehwag's slaughter of the pakistani bowling. hehe .. it's especially amusing what the author says abt dravid's early return to pavilion. one can just imagine [ not too tough if u've seen dravid play in recent times] what dravid could have done if he had stayed ... to say one thing for sure - tendulkar might not be on the pitch right now :) ...  the author says the paki bowlers will have to see the really depressing sight of tendulkar and sehwag come out to bat tomm morning ... add to this the fact that laxman and yuvraj singh are yet to show up !

      The univ campus was particularly deserted this morning when i made the pleasing walk from home to comp lab. i call the walk pleasing coz it was free of the regular crowded parking lots and large number of people hanging out in the cafe on my way ... and overall the noise created by so many people just going abt their business. I for once could experience a silent and exceedingly enchanting univ campus ... very rarely has this been so ... though the last time was last week .. thru spring break :)  my general routine of blogging in the morning is to come and read thru all my links and maybe some other news items i find on the way ... after ive done this i blog abt whatever i feel important or whatever strikes .... most of the things that i DO decide to blog abt ... i forget by the time i get to blogging ... how do you counter this ? use the BlogThis feature on the Google toolbar !

      This just happened this morning ... and i would have put it in earlier ... had i not been out to the mall, getting some lunch and some afternoon siesta before i eventually showed up here in the evening ! anyways ... generally i would have forgotten abt this coz it's trivial ... but for some reason .. it just popped up right now ... so ...  good for me :)  yeah .. so .. this morning i was on the phone talking to someone in india .. im currently using my roomies nokia 6800 mind you .. and it has a voice recorder ... and it has this nice feature i found out abt a couple of days back ... whereby you can record your call ... so as it happened .. im talking to my family in india ... and the reception is not all that good ... so my cousin asks me to call his cell phone ... but i didnt have the number, nor did i have paper and pen to write it down .. so what do i do ? i turn on the recorder and as he speaks the number ... my trusty phone with it;s neat little voice recorder captures the number ...  I conveniently went to the library near which i'd been standing ... and wrote down the number.  now isnt that cool ?  unfortunately .. the phone I got from t-mobile .. the nokia 6610 .. doesnt have a voice recorder ... and thats why I would love to prolong the re-exchange of phones with my roomie .. hehe

      this happened in january ... during my visit to pune.  I dont particularly remember where I was coming from though im sure I was on my way back home. I had mom's car i think and was waiting for the lights to turn green at the nal stop signal. It's a very crowded junction these days and I was there in the evening ours when every city working bird is returning home for ' garam garam chaha and pohe/samosa/khari ' .. whatever .. so this is when it happened ... I was looking around ... you know - browsing the people around .. and there was this car in front of me ...   Out of nowhere this kid showed up ... abt 12-13 yrs old ... and started wiping the windshield of that car ... the obvious aim being the car owner/driver would give him some money in return for cleaning the car ... he so dilingently went abt his job of cleaning that he didnt even think abt how the car driver could choose to not pay him anything in the end .. how he just might have to watch the car vroom away at the turn of the signal ...    Seeing this scene ... I checked my pockets ... for some change i might have to hand over to the boy ... I was ready to get my car cleaned in whatever haphazard fashion he would do it ... and I found a 5Rs coin ... which was ready in my hand ... and I was waiting for the boy to try my car when he wasnt paid by the other driver .... but he didnt show !! he just went by to the side of the road .. for whatever reason ... he just didnt come to ask me for money ... or clean my car or whatever !  Here I was waiting to hand him some money ... and there he was .. running elsewhere in search of that same money ... now this is a simple situation really ... but couldnt this be everyday life for so many of us ? We crave things everyday ..  we have no clue abt whether we deserve them .. or if we are  actually going to get them ... etc etc ... and we just get disappointed when we dont get them .. whereas for all we know those things are right there .. somewhere around us .. waiting for us to find them ...  all this makes me think ... why did God make man such a clueless being ?

      These past few days, Ive been looking around wherever I go for photo ops. Ive been pretty impressed with all the Pbase and Photofriday material I take in almost everyday. Just makes me feel like i shud put my photography skills [whatever little I have] to use and get some pics of my own.  I'm not expecting something really big on quality, but I would love to put in some actual work and see the results.

      Does it ever happen to you -          You are in a conversation with someone and they ask you something. some stupid little question you never thought abt in your life or maybe you just didnt care ! and when you answer them ... you say something which is like 'ok' for the moment... then afterwards [2 min , 2 hrs or 2 days later !] you feel like you shud have answered differently ? this happens a lot to me ... a lot i tell you ... i mean it happens atleast 2ce [twice] or 3ce a week.  all that tells me that i shud think before i talk, take some time ... or else ... just forget abt it and not care .. does it really matter ? i mean im not interviewing for a job or something where i shud be more prepared :)

      hey ... im just noticing this ... ive been using Mozilla Firebird on and off now ... and it's good ...  i think it's better than IE at times ... though i dont know the full functionality of it ... and how it compares ... i can say it's good for whatever ive done ... which is simple browsing ... it's got a built in pop-up blocker ... a built in Google search box ... simple interface with lots of space for the actual website [etc etc .. u know where im going] .. but i know there are going to be things with Mozilla that i wont like ...  but so be it ! who's ever got the perfect software , eh ? :)  thinking abt resources, i was just thinking yesterday how i long to do so many things right now when i dont have all the resources available. eg. - going on long drives to small towns around here, going on photography shoots, enjoying sports, eating out a lot ... etc . now that i cant do it all so often [ i dont have a car, camera nor the money and time to invest in any of the above] it all seems like the grass on the other side [greener !] hehe ... but the question here is ... will i actually do all these things when i have these resources at my disposal ? or will i find some new greener pastures and try to get to those meadows ? I think atleast for sometime, I will enjoy my new found freedom before it all starts to bore me and i move on .. so now a new question ... do your hobbies ever bore you ? i think such times are very rare.  Right now im sitting in the lab in a corner seat ... the window on my left shows big blue skies with puffy white clouds around ... the sun shines brightly at times and hides behind one of the clouds for sometime. The blinds are open which still leaves that shadow on me ... I'd love if I could find such a place for myself ... no disturbances ... no noise .. just me , sunshine, clouds, birds, trees, my computer , all the software i crave and a broadband internet connection. atleast for the weekends .. such a lovely image.

      Why !!  why ... why me ? why do i always have to get people who want to voice chat around me ? why ... damn it. It's so irritating when people do it in public places ... you have no intention of listening to them but they leave you no choice ... and distract you from what you are trying to do. It's good if they are talking in a foreign language ... it's just noise to you and you can find ways to ignore it .. but when it's some language that you fully well understand, it's so damn tough .. i think i'll have to change my place. I tried and found this place ... smooth keyboard .. optical mouse ... in the corner [so my cell phone gets a signal] and this guy comes and sits right behind me ... always ... this has happened for like the 3rd or 4th time now ... idiot.

      This week's photofriday promises to stand out ... im sure it'll have the most number of pictures worth another look ... "morning" is a subject dear to almost any photographer ... and so my guess is almost everyone [however amateur they may be] have taken a good shot to suit the subject ... and so the competition this week will be tough ... but that just gives us all the more amazing shots in the noteworthy column next to next monday :).  Finally got the haircut ... waited almost 2 whole months to get one.

      my roomie sent me today an awesome piece of news.    urlLink Samir Mathur , an Associate Professor at Ohio State University, has made a discovery about how information persists even inside black holes. Till today physicists all over the world had not been able to prove either sides of the statement and it was generally assumed that information is completely lost inside a black hole. Dr. Mathur along with his associates has worked on something called "string theory" to develop a new set of equations which explain how the information persists inside black holes in the form of strings. I know ... this will probably sound incoherent to you. but that's my fault ... DO read more abt the same here -  urlLink http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/fuzzball.htm .

       urlLink Photofriday.com  lists 5 noteworthy pics from the week's entries,. they are the pics which recieve the most votes for noteworthy i guess. So i just voted on my first full list today. haha .. and i chose abt 25 photos ... nothing wrong there ... just wierd that even though i know they show only 5 .. i chose more .. much more ... maybe now on .. i'll have to do my selection in levels ... 25 first ... then 10 .. then the 5 i think are best :) ... aah .. who cares ... all of them are really good efforts.  Race really late tomm nite ... well not really late ... starts at 2 i think ... but it continues till 4 ... so maybe i'll just set an alarm for 3:30 and sleep ... get up , watch the ending, sleep again .. and then get the details of it all on sunday morning !

      It's wierd how my "questions abt life and it's purpose" bout strikes without notice. Out of the blue, im thinking deep abt what it is that im doing on earth. The question is serious to me ... coz i tend to justify all my life moves according to the answer to this one question. while talking to someone today, i asked him this ... and he said life is about going on and on and on ... one day at a time ... take it as it comes .. etc etc .. and i agree with the philosophy quite a lot ... but it doesnt answer my question. he also said [must have been kidding] that you have to be very lucky in life to get some things ... and that wanting to find the answer to this question is one of them .. unfortunately the answer to this question is found and understood by only a few super super lucky people and i think that once you've found this 'one' answer .. you're ready to move on ... you get 'mukti' and you pass on to the next level .. be it heaven or hell ! so people who find the answers [or know them from birth] have the perfect knowledge of what it is that they are here to do ... and such people , being rare and almost godly are called 'saints'.  hmm ... not bad for one day :) .. more later. as per advice though ... im going to go for a walk .. i have a mobile now .. so im very much accessible. oh yeah ! thats the 'happening' thing of the day .. me exchanged my mobile with my roomie ... his phone is much better than mine and overall he's got the bad deal ... but [ofcourse there's a 'but'] we did this to test out the feasibility of such an option .. it's so much fun to have a choice of phones ... right ?

      haha ... just to show how wierd americans and their laws are .. here's a sample -   "THE HOUSE of Representatives voted 276 to 139 Wednesday to pass the Personal Responsibility in Food Consumption Act -- also known as the "cheeseburger bill" -- to prohibit overweight Americans from suing the food industry for their avoirdupois. Given that a 2003 Gallup Poll found that 89 percent of Americans don't believe in blaming the fast-food industry for obesity, you'd think the bill is unnecessary.   I take this vote as Washington's way of recognizing that in America, a bad idea, given enough time, will gain support, take root and become law. If there's one value that has been eroded in America, it is the belief in personal responsibility. Hence the House vote. "  This is from an article by  urlLink Debra Saunders for the San Francisco Chronicle .

      I haven't felt like writing these past few days ... maybe like the past 10 odd days ... ive been busy with exams [2 in the last 3 weeks] and projects [controls phase 1 and 2] and homeworks for Simm Comm ... i have put in some entries but they've been trivial things ..  anyways ... some of the other things that have kept me are Sherlock Holmes and the stock market ... ive made inroads into the domain of technical analysis and have been mystified by the analytical and deduction powers of Mr. Holmes of Baker Street at the same time. hehe .. if u've read all the stories .. and successively like ive done in abt a month ... u'll know how Dr. Watson is probably the stupidest guy on earth !! lol .. i mean being with a guy like Sherlock Holmes any dimwit would start to understand things .. u know what i mean ? wouldnt it be natural if some qualities of Holmes rubbed off on the doctor and once in a while he made a deduction of use to the case .. or maybe brought to light certain point ? it wouldnt hurt Holmes' reputation for sure ...  reading Sherlock Holmes stories along with trying to learn the ropes of technical analysis, ive learned a few important things in the share market. one very important thing ive learned is to guage the time span of a trade ... there are very many trades that in hindsight seem but natural to have made ... but when considering a new trade .. either buy or sell short [ see im fluent in the terminology ! doesnt take much time for that though] .. you have to be extra careful in your analysis, verify what you've concluded with some good sites [reuters, yahoo, msn, barchart and there are hundreds if not thousands more] and then have atleast a week or two for the trade to actually work out .. and this is for short term trading ... when considering investments .. dont even think abt timelines less than 6 months ... have patience .. it is a very very important quality in this field.  btw .. im getting my cell phone tomm .. it's a tmobile connection with a nokia 6610 phone .. good buy .. but now ATT came out with a super duper deal today which has kinda put to shame my deal hunting skills ... so there goes 3200 .. tata

      There is an amazing number of "anti-outsourcing  to INDIA " sites out there which is troubling. A few sites attempt to counter this movement and overall americans seem to think that India and it's superior IT services are to blame for them losing their jobs. How about thinking in terms of lowering their costs and improving their efficiencies to get their jobs back ? whoever makes these decisions to outsource certain jobs makes them out of intelligence ... they want profits out of every business move they make ... not because they hate americans or love indians ... i'm sure tomorrow these same people would take the jobs out of India and China to Africa if it were possible to get them done better and cheaper there .. so what exactly is so wrong with Bangalore and India that americans have made it a national cause ? haha .. they are actually talking abt tax dollars being spent on outsourcing ... do even half of these people know the numbers ? it's just sickening at times ...  urlLink Blame India Watch  is an awesome site that you must look at to see the other side of the argument .. it also lists some anti-outsourcing websites.

      " The mother of all games " ... thats what Yuvraj Singh calls India-Pakistan cricket games ... haha .. so true .. so bloody true ... there's never been another game in cricketing history with so much attention .. no tour ever played where so many people were watching ... except maybe if there was ever a China-India game that was so anticipated :) ... but only world cup football brings more people to the TV than a India-Pakistan match ... hehe ... if i were to predict statistics ... atleast 1/2 of India and Pakistan will be watching the matches ... which is in itself abt 500 million people ... so there you have it .. need more ? India rocks ... we have a great cricket team and i hope we win ...   On to Formula1 .. same old story .. yeah baby :D ... schumi and barichello take pole and 2nd on the grid to put montoya in 3rd place ... 4th is a surprise though .. jenson button and BAR Honda make it their starting place in Australia this year ... im hoping the race will be a great one and a fitting start to this season.

      here's a major mistake i was committing in my study of the share market. i just found it in  urlLink this book by Steven Achelis.  He says :  "Opportunities exist in any time frame. But I have rarely met a successful short-term trader who wasn't also a successful long-term investor. And I have met many investors who get caught by the grass-is-greener syndrome, believing  that using shorter and shorter time periods is the secret to making money - it isn't."  This is exactly what i was doing ... reducing my time period for analysis in the hopes that i could predict the trends better. Improvement in this regard is but natural now !

      i hate , despise, loathe ... absolutely abhor taking any sort of medication. i will not take myself to a doctor coz i do not believe in their capacity to heal ... yes .. i HAVE been to doctors before ... ive had a few of my body parts mended .. but not for stupid little things like cough and fever .. it's just not for me .. i hate the idea of depending on some little pill or syrup or injection to relieve me of my pain ... i know .. this is silly .. but thats how it is ..   now fortunately i havent had to take any serious medication .. no grave sickness ever .. but the occassional cold and cough or back pain or headache that i get .. makes me feel miserable ... and all thru this .. im open to let it go by itself .. rather than head straight to a clinic to get treated ... friends and relatives [who obviously care abt my health] are quick to suggest pills and tablets .. and as usual im quite eager to turn them down ..  i hate the fact that my body shud be dependant on some artificial substance to get better ... hehe .. now why cant i have some natural remedy .. im totally in for treatments like accupressure and maybe accupuncture [i'll have to try it once] .. but no taking anything.   i can imagine what my basic fear is .. i think that taking a medicine will disturb my body chemistry and will induce me into taking some more for the side effects that the first medicine may cause ... i am scared by the utterly limited knowledge we have of the human body ... even doctors - they just know more than ppl like me .. still i think its superficial .. we dont know the complexities of the human body .. and what we have is generic knowledge.  i guess for me .. being fit is a way of life ... not something you can mend and prop up from time to time .. i am proud to say that my body has been fit until now .. bcoz of all the physical activities ive pursued ... and maybe .. just maybe .. somewhere deep down .. my ego is hurt when such small things are enough to pester me ... make my days miserable.

      This entry inspired by another entry from a blog i read - that entry was about conversations ... but this is abt friends and acquaintances ... i remember one such acquaintance who thought she was a friend .. and when she found out things to the contrary .. she  asked me abt whom i consider friends and who are acquaintances ... i had no answer for her then .. but i knew i classify most people i know as just that - "people i know". that doesnt go well with certain people .. unlike me .. they tend to classify people as friends or enemies or unknown humans !  so getting to the main point .. i read an entry today that suggested me of an answer to the question above .. who would i consider friends ? well .. people who i can hang with without agenda .. people i can be comfortable with anywhere [almost anywhere!] ... people who know me .. my strong points .. my limits .. and dont exploit either .. people who just let me be .. to simply copy from that entry .. our friendship isnt changed by things like the distance between us .. or the time we spend together .. or the number of phone calls we make ... or our use of whatever other communication means the world has invented ... it depends on knowing that these friends will be there when i need them .. and i'll be there when they need me .. its that easy .. ive been lucky enough to find a few real gems like that .. they are always there .. always just close enough to be in touch ... that may mean a 4 line email in 6 months .. or even no emails no phones .. just knowing the presence of the person .. just knowing the person exists and is happy in his/her life .. thats enough to maintain friendship .. so overall i think friendship is something much more than being around in daily life .. it transcends the limits of communication and cannot be established in a day ... you have a friend when you have learnt to trust a person and are honest with that person ..   i hope all of you out there are fortunate enough to have atleast one of yours ...

      Things are getting busy now ... for the next 2 weeks i dont c myself out of work ... every breathing moment of mine should have a purpose !! hehe .. you wont see me just sitting doing nothing ... everything [from studying/projects/HWs to sleeping/eating] will have a time and will be done then :) .. strict time management .. hehe .. that just sounds so ridiculous ! ive never been able to do it .. but i'll try .. coz otherwise i dont c any positive outcomes from the next 15 days ..  anyways .. for the same reasons .. entries here might be sporadic and rare ... also another reason i need to start off with finishing the work is i feel too supine and lethargic today ... and its always a bad sign when i feel like this .. things never happen and im in a foul mood when i feel this way ... so better snap out of it ... borrow some enthu from friends ... and get down to work !

      Chk out the new  urlLink Yahoo! Messenger 6.0  .. i got it today .. and it looks good ! ready to compete with the new versions from MSN and AOL .. the thing i like abt it now is it gives me access to my Launch station thru my messenger ! no need to go to the site and play it ... plus .. everything looks so much better now .. till 5.5-5.6 it looked pretty much archaic ... from the Windows 98 days ... now it looks much better .. i can actually forsee myself using it more often :) .. haha maybe i shud say all this in a mail to yahoo ... they'll be so pleased with their efforts.  "Minimize any frustration by taking each worry as a separate piece. Check things off your list one by one, and don't look back until you get to the end." - Thats part of my horoscope today ... i desperately need to do that ... i have a homework due on wednesday that i haven't started yet ... and i have presentations due next week ... work on which shud ideally start a.s.a.p. so u c .. this applies to me 100% .. one more thing that applies to me and is in my horoscope for today - "You know how reserved and stoic you normally are? How you usually don't bat an eyelash when someone new and interesting goes by, especially if you're working?" ... hehe .. thats sooo true ! and my horoscope says its going to change today .. i dont see how .. but what the heck .. nothing provides as much entertainment value in the morning after ive chked my mail as much as my horoscope .. except for maybe Ziggy and Garfield .. hehe :)

      it's been a sporty day ... woke up early [6:30 am] to watch the San Marino GP. Schumi ruled as usual .. and that was that .. caught a few winks after the race before getting up .. and getting to the lab. got the daily stuff out of the way only to chat some time with mom [that's always nice isnt it !] and bro...  went home to get some lunch .. which didnt turn out to be such a good thing .. had to suffice on noodles and they didnt come out good ... were too soggy .. anyways .. it wasnt anything two bowls of ice cream couldnt fix :D .. this was while watching the Lakers-Rockets game ... slept again for like half an hour .. got up and went to play table tennis ... which was fun for a while .. just got back ... and now i was trying to get some stuff done related to my class ... isnt happening .. just wont work out .. i dont know what im doing wrong .. but im certainly doing something wrong .. hehe .. atleast i know that much !  When i watched the race this morning ... there were a lot of interesting bits i thought i'd write about .. but im just too bored right now to blog about it .. montoya was a cry baby ... thats whats important .. i dont understand why he behaves the way he does .. he's such a good driver .. give him a fast car and he's great on his day .. he doesnt have to be so aggressive to show people he's good.  more later maybe ...

      the rainfall here on campus leaves behind very bright and green trees and wet benches. This scene fascinates me no ends and i feel the urge to photograph any and all such wet benches on campus. The moisture in the benches gives them a rustic feel not so easily achieved otherwise. I love it ...  A short walk and then egg curry for dinner ... nice plan eh ? :)

      hello to anyone who's been waiting impatiently for an entry here ... that number would probably be .. eh ZERO ! hehe .. looking at my site stats i know for sure that the number ain't zero ... i also see some specific servers logging almost daily visits and am happy to note that those people are visiting and keeping up with my life .. ofcourse i wouldn't know who is visiting in case the servers belong to ISPs .. but in some cases i can deduce [long standing fan of Sherlock Holmes that i am] who is showing up to read ... or the least i can do is presume its the people i think it is.   Recently the days have been all about getting a job and graduation and exams and stuff like that ... life's not full of action ... im sleeping late everyday and getting up even later ... i shud make it a habit to get up by 7:30 max every morning ... i think it makes the day go much better than getting up at 10 or so...  Ive been seeing a lot of photo ops recently .. im training my eyes to visualize good photographs .. imagining/visualizing photographs is free :-), the equipment costs a lot of money ... but i'll have it someday ... these things are high up on my wishlist ... a decent car, a good camera etc ... and they will come ... it might take some time thats all .. im ready to wait. anyways ... so its rained big time here today ... and i could envision some really good sepia tone/ b&w pictures out there ... everything was two-tone ... either black/dark brown or some shade of green .. and it looked really beautiful  I saw Gothika last nite ... not such a good movie ... a good effort by everyone .. but the story doesnt have anything to it ... it's one of those movies where the actual point of the film takes 5 mins to explain and the rest of the 2 hrs are just fancy shots .. plus this movie is dark ... i mean literally !! hehe .. it could have been well lit or atleast decently lit ... but the movie doesnt have proper lighting .. and at times you get the feeling you are playing one of those "kill-the demons" games like doom/quake ... the lights keep flashing and your eyes bear the brunt. anyways .. in the end it turns out that the ghost has gotten into halle berry's character to avenge it's death .. it [a girl ghost] has been killed by berry's husband and his friend and the ghost is trying to avenge itself ... haha .. it uses berry to get the world's attention to the killings [haven't we seen that before !] .. anyways .. i didnt particularly like it. we're hoping to watch Kill Bill vol.I and Dreamcatcher sometime ... i hope they turn out better.

      I got a gmail account ... I GOT ONE !!! hehe ... the much controversial web-based email by Google [parent company of Blogger] ... i got what i wanted ... and it's amazing :) ... i was offered one as a blogger user and i jumped up to grab it !! it's 1GB .... imagine ... never have to delete a mail now ... haha .. not that im a big archiver ! but maybe i'll become one now ... who knows ...  the first impression abt Gmail - simplistic and minimalist. The user-interface isnt dazzling nor is the screen made to look good ... but then Google was never abt glamour ... its always been abt efficiency and getting the job done. and whatever you have against the privacy issues with Gmail ... im fully convinced by what Google says abt the issue ... I dont mind if they insert AdSense ads into my email [automatically - software does everything] ... as long as im getting an inbox of 1GB.  well ... i was planning on writing something nice [i dont rem what now !] when i logged into blogger ... and it all went poof once i saw the gmail offer !! i was so thrilled ... i forgot abt everything else and rushed to the gmail site ... lest they dont have an account for me later !!! who knows .. .anything could go wrong .. haha ... i was a child again .. now im at rest once ive checked it all out ... lots of cool features ... but more later !

      there's so much happening all the time ... life is packed with incidents and dialogues worth remembering. every little thing doesnt stick to the brain though so that i could put it in here ... believe me when i say i try to remember things that can be put in here ...   anyways ... this past weekend has been characterized by a cough/ dry mouth and voicelessness. ive been coughing all the time and i have lost any remote possibility of a high pitch in my voice. all shud be well though .. i'll be back to normal in a couple of days ... salt water gargling is a decent remedy ... ive been suggested hot milk with turmeric and honey and black pepper and what not ! it is evident to me that i'll suffer from the taste of that drink for more days than the original cough itself ... so it's been given a rest and ive continued with salt water gargling for the past 2 days ... i hope this goes now .. coz now my back is starting to hurt coz of the coughing and i might be sleepless tonite ... if i dont take a sleep inducing expectorant.  i have an exam tommorrow for which i shud be studying .. last one didnt go off so well .. so maybe i can do better this time around .. better get to studying now.

      Sorry to all of you who found the colors of the past 2 days to be revolting ! i myself .. after 2 days ... have come to senses ... and changed the scheme ... i hope this one is more soothing to your eyes :-).  On the personal front ... me is suffering from a soar throat and a bass voice ! i already had cough symptoms over which i drank some cold stuff with lemon ! and that has caused this problem .. i got complimented on my voice by a single person ... but that apart .. i'd be happier without this condition. it'll go on its own in a couple of days ... so that shudnt be a problem.  Life's been cool otherwise ... there's stuff to do .. and im enjoying the rest of the time with my roomies ... which is fun too ! it's going to be a frustrating few weeks to come though ... after which the battle to earn a living starts .. lets see whats planned for me :)

      Not such a great day ... very relaxing though .. i didnt do much .. just got on with the simulation that i need to finish sometime soon ... for which i need to get started with it ... which hasnt really happened in the past few days ... moreover i have an exam coming on wednesday which aint helping matters .. anyways .. this is fun so im not complaining. Today wasn't completely waste ... i got the two required books from library ... and cooked ... got some sleep in the afternoon .. so overall a very laid back day ... got some new ringtones ... the pan'jabi mc ringtone is wicked !! hehe .. makes you start dancing then and there :) .. bhangra and all .. hehe .. not much else to post right now ... i dont think much will come over the weekend ..  oh yes ... India won the test series ... how awesome is that ? they are slowly and steadily rising to the top in the world of cricket. i think australia and south africa are the only two teams india will find tough to beat on a given day ... but after the showing they put up on the aus tour ... those doubts are lesser .. now the australian tour of india in oct/nov. come over mr. ponting and company ... but be ready to lose. are we playing s. africa  or england [tests] anytime soon ? england needs a beating for sure ... hehe ... right now its almost "bring on the world" though this could easily lead to complacency and over-confidence [it usually does !]. i think i'll write abt some of the things im looking forward to doing once [and IF] i land a job here in the US. sometime soon...

      ROYALLY SCREWED !!! ... plz ask again ... ROYALLY !! is the answer ... the paper wasnt really bad ... but i sucked at solving the problems with any success ... my chances were like 1/10 of actually getting anywhere near the answer .. damn .. and yes .. you can blame me .. and you'd be right most of the times ... but this time it was different .. there are times when you just cannot do 'anything' to avoid the imminent low grade ... i'll be very very happy to scrape thru on a B here ... only thing remaining is the presentation .. no clue abt it .. but will have to put up a strong show there to get the grade. hope he's [the prof] not cruel to graduating students.

      " Here, with his eyes on the prize that this generation of Indian cricketers wants so badly, Dravid did not blink. "  So aptly put ... this is what Amit Varma [Managing Editor, Wisden Cricinfo India] had to say at the end of the bulletin describing the 3rd day of play in the indo-pak test match.  he was talking about dravid's 270 and how resolute and unwavering his stand on the wicket was. india  has been waiting for an overseas test series win for a long long time now ... and it almost came in the best of places .. Australia ... had we won it .. people would have cut the team some slack in this series ... but its pakistan ... they are not an overseas team [technically] but they are what we call "arch enemies" ... victory over pakistan is always the sweetest ... and if [rather when] we win this match .. it'll be a day of glory for indian cricket.  notice how a certain mr. tendulkar hasn't done so well in any of the wins ? i mean he's getting his century once in a while .. like every 2-3 matches ...  but thats expected from him .. heck thats like expecting a 50 from yuvraj singh every time he plays or expecting pathan to get a wicket ... but thats not enough from "apna tendlya" .. he shud be doing what dravid and laxman are doing ... winning us matches ... scoring when it's most important and needed ... not when it just counts as a statistic ! anyways ... it's always good to have tendulkar play for us .. always ... even though he may not score a 400 like lara ... and might not play on a given day ... he enthuses indians with his bat like no one else can.

      day has been ok types ... nothing big happened except spurious incidents that might sound slightly interesting when i read this some years later :) .. thats the point isnt it !  so ... this morning in the library .. i saw this woman ... she was wearing some old purple color t-shirt with a bead necklace. her hair was blonde and let loose ... and she was wearing denim shorts ... rather they were a pair of jeans cut short to the knees ... the most interesting thing abt her was that she didnt have any footwear on !! haha .. one look at her reminded me of "dharma & greg" [the tv serial] and how dharma's mom dressed on the show. this woman was straight out of the 70s. she looked wierd but the singularity of her dress and presence set her apart in that big crowd in the library. Even in the small time of 5 secs that i saw her ... she left a positive impression about her integrity. She looked really comfortable the way she was.  the formula 1 scene shifts to ferrari homegrounds at Imola ... the names of the turns at imola have always fascinated me ... for no particular reason ... i like the sound of them ... thats the first track abt which i found out they had names for turns !! Acque Minerali, Variante Alta, Variante Bassa, Rivazza and more .. the track is called "Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari" which roughly translated means - Enzo and Dino Ferrari's automobile race track. i hope im right !! hehe .. google helped me out here .. whatever ... it'll be a great race .. ferrari dominating the races this season .. and there's very little chance that something different will happen at the San Marino GP.  I shud be studying right now ... I have this exam tomm morning .. it's tough .. but it's open book ... I did study thru the day [as much as I normally do !] and more is coming ... i just thought i needed a distraction for now and hence wandered here .. i was browsing for some time before i logged on ... and found some cool sites ... and fool that i am ... i have forgotten abt them instead of bringing them to you :) .. anyways .. there's always a next time.  readership here is increasing slowly as people drop in from other sites i visit ... dont know how they feel abt this blog .. but thats not necessary right now. ive been thinking of buying a domain for myself ... but thats one of the things that'll wait till i get a job and start earning for myself .. till then ... wait for me my dear planned domain .. hehe.

      Nice day today .. it's warming up after the rain inflicted some cold on us for the past 2 days .. i was going home from class ... and what do i see ... two guys in a convertible went past me ... the music system in the car blaring out Usher's "Yeah" to the street ... the sun shining brightly and the guys enjoying their slow drive thru the campus ... i was almost dreaming and seeing myself in a covertible driving like them ! I dont know why, but opinions of strangers seem to have more of an effect on me than people around me ... people i know ... somehow i rate the opinion of a stranger as unbiased while the same might not be the case with known people ... for example ... someone tells me to read a book .. if a stranger is doing so ... say in his blog .. or a person whom i dont know as much is telling me that a certain book is great/must-read etc ... i take it at face value and think the book must be good ! .. in the same situation .. if someone i know very well tells me to read the same book ... i think .. why ? whats in this book that i shud read ? why does this person think i shud read this book ? basically .. i read into it more than necessary ... its annoying at times ...

      New weblog discovered today via photofriday ... it's called  urlLink Karmakar's.com  ... and it's by a guy called Amit Karmakar down in Australia ... looks and feels really cool .. especially his photography ... while you are there ... do chk out his  urlLink photoblog   too .. awesome.  I need to analyze my behavior in the meanwhile ... im doing some things which i dont understand why im doing ... im doing them solely on the base of my intuition .. and the only thing i can say to justify my actions is ... "i feel what im doing is the best for now" ... this behavior of mine needs some serious analysis and maybe some counter measures even !

      It's been an almost useless past couple of days ... havent done much thru thursday and friday .. and now it's time to get started. Digi Comm needs some studying and i need to look over the case study in the other class ... there's homework to be completed for the third class and job application never stops. So overall .. lots to do ... and im sure to pace out everything ... haste is not my forte ..   It's been a beautiful 2 days ...clear skies and warm temperatures ... basically Texas heaven :) ... shud have done something .. but !! anyways .. someday i'll do all these things too .. for today .. it's back to graduating and getting that desperately desired degree.

      anxiously waiting for Gmail, the webmail service from google ? so am i :) ... here's an interesting thing pointed out by  urlLink this post  on  urlLink slashdot.org . It says Google isnt really offering webmail .. as in the webmail service is just a facade ... the real thing they are focusing on all along [even through the search engine and other business they do] is the creation and management of "a massively scalable, distributed computing platform." ... hmmm ... interesting !

      there's been some things worth writing ... and time and again ive forgotten over the weekend to log 'em. anyways ... i think ive forgotten half of what i originally wanted to write ... so i'll just put in whatever comes to mind right now.  Great race over the weekend ... Bahrain rocked as Ferrari registered a "not-so-rare-anymore" 1-2 finish. they did a great job on a track where their closest competition produced 1 out of 4 result ... ralf finishing a poor 7th. montoya, raikonned and coulthard all disappointed by failing to complete .. montoya must have been especially depressed with his result ... his car gave up due to some sort of engine failure in the second last lap i think .. or maybe it was the last lap ! reminded me of how schumi once won a race when mika hakkinen's car broke down on the last lap with like a few hundred yards to go for a win. mclaren has been surprisingly lagging this year ... and raikonnen - expected to produce big results this year - has done bad more so. nobody was expecting anything good from DC [except DC fans !] .. not until Silverstone anyways ... coz thats the only GP he does well at ... ralf and montoya have been their inconsistent selves till now ... my good guess is renault and bar honda will compete well this year giving williams a tough fight for second place. mclaren has not done well till now .. but there's 15 more races to go ... u can never know !  there's this article i saw today on msn .. and it asked the question .. "married or single - which is better ? which is easier" .. and that set me thinking ! hehe ... i wont put my thoughts here ... but i'd like you to know that i was thinking abt the topic ... comparing merits and demerits of each.  hoping for better times soon ..

      Formula1 stops in Bahrain this weekend for the first time ever. Race track surrounded by sand .. sand .. and more sand. everywhere u look .. there's fine brown particles of the eye-irritating compound. Ferrari grab 1-2 once more and it shud be an interesting race for the sheer novelty of track that we can see. couple of conversations with friends brought out the ineptitude of the two williams' drivers ... and more than that .. just showed how experienced schumi is.  There was a suggestion somewhere in the Formula1 magazine [jan edition i think] which said schumi shud get into consultancy now abt car settings ... and though that thought sounds great ... i have my doubts abt how much schumi's settings will suit other drivers ... the thing is .. his experience in racing formula 1 will keep him afloat in the business for as long as he'd like. he'll soon be bored of dominating the season like he's done in the past few years and he'll let go of driving .. but formula 1 will stay .. maybe he'll be the next ferrari boss ? i hope not .. coz team bosses need to know a lot more than driving the car and driving it fast. whatever ... im sure we'll see schumi around in the sport even after he stops driving. the day just might come in 2006 when he ends his contract with ferrari.  and pray can someone tell me whats wrong with Mclaren Mercedes ? why arent they getting anywhere in the ranks this season ? i know it's only the 3rd race ... but still .. i mean they havent done anything  ... poor races have been the order this season so far. hope they'll do something abt it.

      heard abt Gateway closing its stores all over america ?    urlLink Gateway Inc. plans to close its entire network of 188 retail stores next week and lay off about 2,500 staff, the PC maker announced Thursday.   how about it !! 2500 people lose their jobs .. thats huge ... on the other hand .. Apple is expanding its retail stores and increasing the count.  Gateway continues its online computer selling business though.   does this mean that slowly but surely some businesses will start depending on the internet sales model popularised by Dell Inc. ? will other businesses follow suit ? maybe the news business ... i personally get all my news online [mostly free] and i think more and more people everyday are losing their preference for newspapers. im sure the numbers are nowhere comparable ... but its a possibility right ? in the near future .. people might be seen reading the sunday morning cartoons on their laptop at their newspapers website. some like me already do so .. everyday :)

       urlLink I wrote  back around the end of April about how I hate visiting doctors and taking medicines and so on. Here's an  urlLink article in the NY Times  about how communication with doctors affects diagnosis.   "Research shows that only 15 percent of patients fully understand what their doctors tell them, and that 50 percent leave their doctors' offices uncertain of what they are supposed to do to take care of themselves. Studies suggest that women are better at building relationships with their doctors than men. The typical number of questions a male patient asks during a 15-minute doctor's visit is zero, while women average six, according to a study by Dr. Kaplan."   Though this para doesn't explain my dislike for visiting a doctor, it surely shows that most men are like me.  On another note:  urlLink This article  is a must read for anyone who is already looking forward to a Lakers-Pistons NBA final. Especially if you expect the series to last 7 games.   "It will be interesting to see how Mailman tries to bully his way by Rasheed Wallace. He cannot hope to outplay Wallace at the point; nor, perhaps, ever."   ....... "You know who has that attitude?  Ben Wallace. "   And you  HAVE  to read the 2 paragraphs that follow this line. Simply awesome if you are a Pistons fan, idiotic blabber if you would like the Lakers to win it all.

      The Calgary Flames are making a name for themselves. They've reached the Stanley Cup finals when people weren't sure about their playoff chances. The fans aren't far behind and are doing everything possible for their team to win. I've not seen such passion among the fans of a team anywhere other than Indians during a Indo-Pak cricket match. If this  urlLink NYTimes article   [subscription reqd]  is to be believed, the excitement is much more than even these games.   "A city judge suspended deliberations in a robbery trial so the jury could watch the opening game of the series. A giddy young couple got so excited about the Flames' success that they named their newborn son Miikka, after the Flames goalie Miikka Kiprusoff. A group of police officers, called to break up a street hockey game on the northeast side of town because the youngsters were making too much noise and smacking the ball off parked cars, ended up joining the game. During the Detroit series, Jodi Hughes, a morning radio personality, called a hotel where the Red Wings were staying at 6 o'clock on the morning of a game to say that she was the wife of Curtis Joseph, the Detroit goaltender, and that she needed to speak to him. The operator put the call through. During the San Jose series, on the morning of a game, a flotilla of truck drivers armed with freight train horns made a racket at 6:15 in front of the hotel where the San Jose team was staying. So far, after police warnings, Tampa Bay players have been spared."

      [BIG Entry Alert] Yesterday was filled with activity. Throughout the day there wasn't a dull moment or rather there was so much going on that the empty bits of time faded into the background. It was invigorating to have spent an active day.  The morning was spent getting back a nice kitchen. The kitchen had been disarray due to the pest-control activities and needed to be set back in order. We spent the morning in arranging all the various items neatly and disposing certain unnecessary items. It was a bit tiring and we didn't feel like cooking afterwards.  We were headed out anyways so Taco Bell seemed the best option. After downing some soft tacos and chalupas, we were headed north-west. My roomie's brother just shifted base from here to a place near his company. He's out of town visiting India and naturally my roomie has to house-sit once a week while his brother is away. We tagged along bcoz we were promised a movie :). In the end we didn't do much, but the trip was worthwhile anyways. It was a hot summer afternoon and quite humid too. We saw a new club near his house and overall finding out new roads and areas around town is a good pastime.  We came back home around six in the evening and we were already planning to go back out. The temple was one of the destinations on the table, but then due to certain small problems we postponed that visit to today. The choice was pretty obvious once the temple visit was postponed. We decided to go to the local park. It's an amazing place. It has the dense greenery, the river, beautiful walkways and trails. Picnic and play areas abound and the lush greenery just brings you to that 'happy place' in your mind. Its very calm and quiet [in between the chatter of fellow park visitors] and the evenings are very beautiful. This was my first visit and I loved the place. I'll certainly go back if and when I get the chance.   We walked along one of the trails and discovered [for ourselves] a new fruit. There was no way for us to know what it was and after some investigation we just discarded it. It looked like a small round jackfruit and was very fibrous on the inside. We also found small trails in the mud which lead to a ravine with a river running at the bottom. It was fantastic and I strongly felt the lack of a camera and hiking shoes. I could have gone on the trail down to the river in my floaters too, but my companions hesitated. It was good in the end though for all that I got to see just stimulated me for some more.  We returned to the picnic area for some snacks and drinks. The conversation was entertaining and the people around were amusing. The evening had been very energizing though we were a bit tired in the end. Yesterday was my day away from the regular and routine. I wasn't online and didn't check my mail till 10pm last nite. I hope I'll have more of such weekends when I finally start working.  Yesterday, or maybe day before, I came across this small piece written by a famous Marathi author. It was about how everyone has to struggle in life to get to where they want to be. Here's what it said [roughly translated]:  "We know how a satellite has all the strife and struggle till it gets to the designed height. It then just floats along or is in harmony. Similarly for a man, all his struggles last until he has reached the destined heights. After reaching this point in life, the man's status takes care of him."  I agreed to a certain extent with this perspective, though not totally. The struggles I feel last your lifetime as you never know when you are destined to reach the level of floating. It's upto you to get that bird's-eye view of the world, or the unbiased third person look of things and happenings. When you have achieved these things, that is the point of no struggle. It just felt nice though to read something like this. Im struggling right now and it feels rather nice to know that struggles do end !  Another thing I though about last nite was black and white photography and why [if] I like it more. I've been looking at some photoblogs over time now and b&w photos just seem to appeal a tad bit more to me. I mean if I were shown b&w and color copies of the same photo, chances are high of my liking the b&w copy. I don't know why this is so. I also know that I like color photos only when they are full of various colors. I like high saturation images with vibrancy which means lots of warm colors. There are some exceptions though, like the photo of the clouds or a seascape or a sunset or greenery. These photos have to portray those specific colors [blue,grey,red,orange,green] to be effective images. This just something new I've learnt about my taste in pictures and hopefully it'll help me when I start shooting with my camera [hopefully sometime later this year or early next year]. Maybe a photoblog will be necessary then :).  Today looks pretty relaxed, but then the past two weeks have been relaxed. We'll go to the temple in the evening and that's the only plan we have. I might watch the Sherlock Holmes movie I got from the library. We watched The Omen on friday nite and it was nice. hehe .. pretty long entry .. and I've not even started about the sports results, viz. lakers-wolves game last nite ans schumi's victory this morning. maybe later ..

      Its going to be a busy day today. I have to go work at the bookstore 11am - 1pm and then go out for lunch. Time till 3pm looks like packed.  I was watching Macaulay Culkin this morning on TV and he has this new movie coming out about Christianity. He said something about his beliefs which I found really true. He said he's more a spiritual person than a religious person.   I've felt like that for a long time now. I don't bind myself to any one particular religion. I'm a Hindu by birth and I adhere to the principles of that religion out of comfort. This does not stop me from questioning the religion or accepting other religions for what they are. All through this I think I'd be right at home being a person of some other faith.  Its really all about whether you believe in God rather than  which  God you believe in.

      We've had a big cockroach problem ever since last year. They have been ubiquitous and the situation has been really annoying. We've gotten the regular pest-control services and follow-ups done to no avail. They always manage to come back to haunt us.   This time it just got too much for us to handle. After 2 real elaborate [supposed] roach killing missions by the pest-control (pc) man, they are still around. The pc guy brought us some glue-paper as an added measure. Its a normal thin cardboard that folds into a box with some open sides for the roaches to climb into. The center of this box has a tablet that maybe attracts the roaches. As the roaches climb into this contraption, they stick to the glue floor. They can't move any further and die of starvation.   Its a very cruel but effective way to get rid of roaches, but then any method that kills the pests is cruel. We've had two such glue papers since yesterday on the kitchen tops and when I checked this morning, both were like circus tents full of animals. Now that I know of this method, I feel this is much better than the vaccuum-em method we were implementing ! haha ... we'd run the vaccuum cleaner and collect all the suckers. I think roaches can't hear. They'd easily be sucked into the cleaner without running around. We would then just change the cleaner bag once it was full [ie. started smelling]. This system is much better if we can obtain the glue paper easily and on a regular basis. Two papers through the night every month or maybe twice a month would take care of our roach repelling needs.  I'm sorry to have put you through this elaborate roach killing scheme. I hope you don't mind. I promise this is a one time deal only :).   Its my roomie's birthday today. Nothing fancy, but we did go and get a cake and some chips and Coca Cola last nite.

      I have this serious urge to cook some new dish. Something simple but very tasty. Today has been a day for food blogs and I have enjoyed browsing through most of them. Concerning cooking though, I have to consider the situation of others eating the same dish. I love cooking and eating all kinds of food, but others in the house have specific requirements regarding what they will eat. Adhering to those makes it incredibly difficult to try out new dishes. Maybe some day I will have the resources and courage to try out whatever fancies my mood. That will be the day I tell you, that will be the day !

       urlLink check this out  ... how cool would it be to get to use something like this ! :) -     " The result was R1, a 110-pound, 6-foot film camera that produces what experts say are some of the highest-resolution landscape photographs ever made.     Kodak Chief Technology Officer James Stoffel says Ross' file is more than a thousand times the size and resolution of those generated by a typical digital camera for consumers. High-end professional digital cameras usually create images that are around 20 megabytes, offering less than a hundredth of the resolution of Ross' images. "   ive added a couple of food blogs to my favorites today .. maybe you'll like going there too. so try out -  urlLink The Amateur Gourmet  and  urlLink Saute Wednesday . I remember visiting the latter site sometime earlier .. but i wasnt saving my favorites at the time. I havent really gone through the sites in detail .. but i like what i see.

      the one word that might define my feelings toward life in the coming few days if nothing happens -   despair  .  I know this is a tough time and I gotto face one day at a time, but the plans change every day and its difficult to decide on how to tackle the situations. What ive decided today might not be the best solution for reasons that surface tomm. there's no clear way out of this .. you got to get up every morning and think of how that day can be the best you've had in recent times. I hope I can get better at doing that.  The place on my mind right now is -  urlLink  Corfu  . Its a Greek island and for some reason just came to mind. Actually I seriously dont have any clue as to why it popped up .. at first I couldnt even remember the name .. just that its a greek island .. and then i put in some effort to find out the name.    Camera   - The one thing i'd love to have right now. I'm in a really bad position right now to be dreaming of such stuff .. but then dreams take you forward right ? the hope that one day your dreams just might come true is what drives you ahead in life.  So check out this scenario, hehe .. and remember .. im just dreaming here -    Im a travel photographer currently on a project in Corfu ! Im on my own with enough money and maybe im even learning to cook Greek food from some granny who lives atop a cliff somewhere secluded on the island .. haha .. i have a bicycle and the latest camera and equipment. the photos pay for my expenses while I enjoy myself around the island - swimming.. cooking .. photography .. biking .. hiking !! what else could i ask for? :) .. its just a dream .. dont judge me for dreaming :)

I'm here looking at books in general, not knowing what to check out and read. Ive already seen a few movies out of here .. and this time im a bit bent on checking out a book. whats come to mind is Fight Club. I havent seen the movie, just heard a lot abt how good it is. so here goes ...

      This is for anyone upwards of 21yrs of age. Its interesting what we keep in the space between our ears :).   Do you remember the address of the place where u lived from age 1 to 5 ? Do you remember your first ever phone number ? maybe the number of your family's first vehicle ? or maybe the name of your class teachers from grade 1 ? you do ?   isnt it nice to find out such things after so long ?  personally i dont remember half the things .. coz they didnt mean much to me then and nobody re-enforced this knowledge on my mind .. but still .. i remember that the first vehicles we had were a bright yellow Bajaj scooter and a Luna. we had a three wheel project car for some time. we had a M50 from Bajaj and it was green and white. hehe .. i dont remember the exact time we got our first phone .. nor the number .. but i remember how excited we were to have a phone at home and to be able to call dad/mom at office anytime we wanted. it was fun to have the ability to talk to people far away and get our message thru. haha .. it was even more fun to make crank calls at midnite .. and sometime later thru the years id carry a phone book in my wallet. I remember some teachers from my grades 1-10 and its fun to try and remember particular incidents in the schooling years.

Oh yes .. did u here abt the Pakistani guy who got arrested here in Texas for trying to buy weapons ? i dont know the name .. but the TV reporter said he was a pakistani national related to some organisation that has contacts with Al Qaida ! haha .. i know its not amusing .. but every Pak/Afghan organisation is related to Al Qaida .. anyways .. u never know ! .. so .. the thing that surprised me is the guy came here for further studies .. and guess what ! he's an MS in EE from some university here in the US .. no prizes for guessing why it surprises me.  and then there was the news of some new polygamous church building some property at a ranch in texas !! hehe .. and how the other residents of the town weren't so comfortable with the idea of having these people in their midst !

      is it wierd that i was dreaming abt my graduation more than a week after it was over ? well .. this was abt some graduation party which no one attended and so you can imagine what the dream went like .. more details are not for everyone .. but suffice it to say that understanding or making sense of your dreams may not be so pleasant all the time. This dream wasn't exactly a nightmare .. nor was it a good happy dream ! it was somewhere in between .. if u know what i mean .. hehe .. but i could make sense of it .. and remember it later .. i dreamt of all this post the event .. and thats why i could make sense of the whole story .. haha .. are afternoon dreams always post events and early morning ones pre-event ? that would be fun wont it .. well .. most people my age dont get to sleep in the afternoon everyday .. so .. anyways  i had this thought earlier in the day ... do they have metrics for things like taste and smell ? well .. im not referring to the property of a substance .. but more the sense of animals. think abt this ... take a standard flavor/taste/smell of some substance. lets go with potato for this example .. now everyone tastes potato differently im sure ... do we have a metric to quantify what i taste vs what you taste ? i hope you are getting this ! :-) .. like my taste of potato is say 75 on a scale of 100, 100 being closest to how to scale was developed or something .. and then we could know better as to preparation of food keeping in mind certain groups of people and data on their taste preferences ? maybe we could have a similar system for smell. im losing it, aint i ?  life's swell apart from these wierd thoughts i have .. hoping for better luck with the job search .. this year will define how I live my life henceforth .. im at the starting block of a 100m race .. and the rest of this year will show what kind of a start i get for this race .. ive already screwed up a couple of times just getting to the starting block .. but that dont [i know .. doesn't, but dont sounds novel to me :)] matter now .. what matters is how i start off here .. and how hard i race. it is a race right ? or is my comprehension of facts wrong? agreed .. its a race against myself .. and i shud not compare myself to anyone etc. but its still a race ... i need to do certain things in a timely manner to be considered a good citizen of this society and to make a name for myself .. right ? ah well .. who's ever had all the answers !  o btw .. i started my temp job at the bookstore today .. just put in an hour and my job starts next week .. its ok .. im earning some money .. and if all goes well .. im expecting to make abt a $100 next week .. or more if things are good.

      yeah .. so as i said in the morning .. the weekend has come and gone .. not that other days of the week im really busy or something .. but the weekend has its own identity. anyways .. ive been upto my usual search for a job .. i have zero leads .. but thru the days i hope to find something that will lead upto a job .. something that will sustain me for the months/years to come .. i realize and acknowledge the possibility that i might not make it at all and im ready to move back to homeland in such a case. the ideal condition would see me working here for atleast a year or two before i decide to go back forever. all the indians here say it's pretty tough and they have this 1+ funda .. where each year you say you'll go back the next year :) .. but im hoping i can be a contradiction exemplified ! lets see how things go .. im sure  God  has things planned for me.  Oh .. on a good note .. i have a temp job at the college bookstore .. its only a week long .. but i will earn something .. haha .. pennies really .. but so what ! i wont have to sit at home and get bored while searching for a job. and perhaps i might also get a longer stint there .. who knows !

The colors are not too bright .. atleast here on my monitor. though im not a big fan of white lettering, i do like it here, looks good. Clean ! have i said that before ;) .. hehe .. lets just say  something  is clean in my life ... just kidding.

      New template ! i created it ... good enough i guess... there are a few problems here and there .. but i'll fix em over some time now .. ive been thinking of whether i want to use the Hello photoblogging tool pushed by blogger .. but as i see it right now .. i dont have the proper equipment to shoot photos anyway .. so i'll postpone any such plans.  job situation is looking real bad right now .. its scary and confusing most of the times .. is it really meaningful living here ? the standard advantages of living in the US are much greater than those in India .. agreed .. but maybe i dont need to compare the two countries on the basis of living standards. India is growing at a much faster rate and India is not hated as much as USA in the world today ! plus having my family around me all the time is important to me. so why not forget job search here and go back and do something ! .. hmm .. certainly something to think abt !  i have taken off comments .. no one was commenting anyways ! maybe i'll put em back someday. till then .. you can just read and think of things you'd like to say to me :) .. hope your thoughts reach me !

      Do u like nicknames ? i mean for yourself ... like for some ppl its ok for friends to call them by their nicknames/petnames. its for people whose full name can be shortened into something thats conventional, normal, socially accepted and heard all round .. like dave for david or bill for william and so on .. u get my point right ? but for some ppl .. its difficult to find a good short name ... for example people who already have short names dont need a  shorter  name ! case in point .. david again ! david is a nice short name .. its not too much stress for your tongue now is it ! why would someone make it into dave ? there are other examples .. though none comes to mind right now .. except my own name .. ppl all over make it into a shorter version thats invariably a female name .. which i dont like .. my school chums call me another name and im not so fond of that either ... and more than not liking them calling me something else .. i dont understand whats wrong with my original name ! hehe .. its pretty short, its not a tongue twister .. americans can say it !  people say its endearing to call someone by a petname .. ok ! i can understand that .. but find a new name .. a shorter name .. work together with the person who will be referred to by that petname .. hehe .. i know this is a bit extreme .. but its doable and everyone will be happy.  I went out today to the local public library and got a card made ... and right away borrowed two movies .. or videos .. coz one of them is not a movie. I got a) Sherlock Holmes - The Creeping Man, and  b)Alfred Hitchcock's - Blackmail I saw Holmes in the afternoon and tried to go on with Hitchcock later .. but I cannot watch 2 movies in a row .. so i stopped. the holmes video is a pretty dull mystery .. not one of the best ... maybe the library has more videos in stock. im hoping so ..

      Among the most prominent news doing the rounds is that of the Indian Prime Minister position and its possible occupants. Till now Sonia Gandhi was the forerunner and might have taken over the reigns of the largest democracy in the world. She has now refused and "humbly stepped aside" ... and maybe .. just maybe .. what humbled her in a single day was how the stock markets dished out a dismal, rather abysmal performance when they recieved this news of her being considered as PM. Ms Gandhi must have been terribly disappointed by these consequences to her desire to be the PM .. and she wasn't even sworn in by this time .. haha .. one can only imagine what would have happened had she actually become PM !! maybe the country would have just stopped working .. one thing i cannot understand is if the nation as a whole is so disappointed in having her as PM or a congress govt. why in the first place did they elect such people ? why o why .. pray someone tell me .. did BJP lose !! politics is beyond me .. but i feel maybe someone can tell me .. i hope to learn more on the subject !  meanwhile .. more on the share markets ... they lost a whooping 800 points before recovering to a loss of just 564 pts for the day ! damn ... thats the largest loss ever in the history of the indian share markets .. and i havent even started to gather stats abt how much money that loss translates to !! who needs those stats .. imagine .. 800 pts .. damn .. we are back to where we were 5 yrs back .. well not totally .. but yes ! the Vajpayee govt. took us through a trough and its start and end can be identified by the two peaks ! .. and still .. india thinks congress is better !

      [ BIG Post Alert  .. this post started abt an hour ago .. and ive been typing things while chatting] have you checked out today's  urlLink Ziggy  ? its the normal monday morning blues cartoon :). Even yesterday's Calvin was nice.  The NBA playoffs are going on right now ... and it's never been so tough a competition since i started following the game .. and as people are saying .. never in this format of the playoffs .. its amazing that all the semifinal series have gone to atleast 6 games with 2 going 7 and a third showing potential !! we know who's going to win it this year .. but lets be cautious and not divulge that info :) [psst: i think its the lakers turn this time] .. but overall .. the series are so tough .. just look at the pistons-nets series .. awesome .. i wonder how the nets manage to win .. but thats not the point. the point is its interesting after so many days .. the NBA was getting into a rut of sorts ... the same teams were winning with the same margins and overall the affair was lackluster .. now its different .. even a minnow like miami is giving indy a tough time and they have tough series on hand ! pistons are facing trouble putting away the nets even with their proven superior team ... the lakers got off easy though they had to play defense to get better of their champion opponents.  which brings me to another topic .. is basketball such a difficult sport to play ? i'd say no .. knowing fully well that u need better skills in some of the other sports .. waterpolo comes to mind coz ive played it at a significant level for some time .. and its one helluva tough sport .. u need strength, breathing skills, swimming skills, stamina ... u name a skill and a waterpolo player needs it. not to say that it is  the  toughest sport in the world .. but its degree of difficulty is certainly higher up than maybe basketball or cricket or baseball ! which makes me wonder : is the number of players that a sport has any indication of its difficulty ? coz waterpolo is not as popular even in countries like russia and hungary, who are at the top of the sport today... and i would say thats coz not many people know swimming to start with .. maybe violence is also an indication of how tough a sport is .. thats why boxing came up as the toughest in the world according to a recent discussion at espn.com.  all of this brings back memories of waterpolo .. i havent played in more than 2 years and i miss it .. all the people i played with .. the feel of competition .. the frustration of losing a winable game .. going on tour .. calcutta, delhi !! all those new places i got to see .. i miss the feel of it all .. id give something to play again .. be a part of a team .. be active ..      i was just checking the  urlLink fina.org waterpolo   site and found that the latest listing of international referees has the name of ajay apte !! how cool .. its just amazing to know when people u know succeed like this .. there's going to be a major waterpolo championship in california in June-July and i wish i could go .. its just a wish though ..

      A new template today. return to a decent, simple and earthy template. all the earlier were imaginative flurries of a hopelessly uncreative mind. anyways .. this template comes from Blogger's arsenal of all new templates. They were given to lazy, unimaginative bloggers like me when Blogger rejuvenated its tools. Ive made some really small changes to suit my taste in fonts and sizes. Do you like it ? the 3 regulars .. pls let me know :) ..   ok ! moving on .. have u noticed how characters in tv shows always know what they want to say ? i mean exactly .. their choice of words is perfect .. the idea they put forth is clear and they are never confused .. i mean yes .. in principle .. they may be confused .. but they know what the confusion is about and can put it into words without any sort of difficulty. i wish i could do that .. i have to wait a while .. form several different sentences in my mind and then choose the best one .. and its not even a problem with my language or vocabulary !! it's just that putting ideas and feelings to words may not be my best attribute. it is for the same reason that i frequent  urlLink dictionary.com . I also identify with things these fictional characters say, and try to remember what they said and in what context. lame ? u bet ...

      ive been really not interested in voting at  urlLink PhotoFriday  off late ... it's been just too tedious a thing to do .. ive more than enjoyed watching the work of a few artists ive come to follow since finding the site and that is good enough for me. sitting and perusing thru 300 odd pictures isnt for me .. which brings us to the point .. how many ppl actually sit and vote for 6 winners out of the weekly entries ? im sure all the posting members certainly do :)

      I graduated today ... actually felt proud of myself while taking the walk and also a bit relieved after the whole thing was done. hehe .. went out to eat and came home only to sleep for 2 hours ... in the evening !! and now im up again .. and dont know what to do :) .. thought it amusing.  so !! graduation done ... took lots of photos .. all on someone else's camera. I wanted a photo of only me taken in some good location with sunlight and green grass etc ... didnt happen .. maybe later in the week. No one attended the ceremony for me .. but i was content to have done it myself. its quite a milestone in life and i might as well do it the one time i have a chance. There are so many people who helped me in some way or the other in these past couple of years .. kinda pulled me thru .. i would like to mention everyone here .. but i wont ... instead, tonite i'll be thinking of you all and thanking you .. hope the thought trickles thru and you realize that you've meant something to me.  without getting anymore sentimental and emotional abt the affair .. lets just move on. life's gonna be a big drag for sometime now ... getting a job isnt the easiest of things .. especially for average students like me .. but still .. trying isnt impossible is it !  on another point of note: following the NBA conference semis ? wow !! none of the series has been slow or boring ... every series is now a best of 3 and it just makes everything all the more exciting .. hehe .. even the east series are going ok .. with miami not giving an inch to a much stronger indiana .. awesome :)

      one day late .. but even more confirmed. the results for the general elections in india were declared yesterday and it was a devastating elections for the ruling National Democratic Alliance. they were the ones to hurry up the elections in the hopes that they would win big time under the "India Shining" theme thats been going on .. and somehow it has backfired big time ... they lost in stronghold states like Gujrat and Andhra .. but won in Maharashtra and Karnataka !! very perplexing results these ... never knew Sonia Gandhi could become the Prime Minister of India .. this is surprising and shocking and i feel at times that it just shows our level of illiteracy as a nation or maybe how we as knowledgable people still have to put up with ignorance and bad govts. just coz we are a minority. is the lack of education to blame ?  having said all of this .. its pretty stupid to assume that Congress wont form and run a good govt. the sudden changes in the fate of ruling govts arent a new thing in today's world. Spain saw it a month or two ago .. and chances are USA will see it in a few months .. overall u could say change is inevitable and the NDA just didnt do enough to guarantee another term in office ... hehe .. that is the most surprising part of it ... they fizzled out in 5 yrs .. just one term ! more was expected ..  on a more trivial note : I got the graduation gown and cap and tassel today .. the tassel for engineers is orange in color and looks really vibrant. maybe i'll take a picture :) ... really waiting for the ceremony now .. its exciting.

      Do u feel the need to categorize all your relationships ? to name every relation u have ? does it confuse you when u dont know what kind of behavior is expected in a new relationship bcoz the relation is not defined ? i hope you get my point ..   Movie news: a few good movies are coming this summer, among them are Shrek 2 and Troy which release sometime soon. Also, the DVD release for LOTR:The Return of the King is due for May 25. not that im buying .. but still .. im excited.

      The day has been excessively boring .. installed a new software on the home desktop and tried using it in the evening ... intentionally took some snaps for this purpose .. didnt come out too good .. but its not bad for a start ..  i need to catch hold of a graduation gown on friday and attend the actual graduation saturday. i also need to start paying more attention to the job search and overall spend my time meaningfully. by the looks of the situation, it seems one way ticket to india for early november isnt a bad idea at all. right now its wait and watch !

      I was going to write something abt what learning is ... i went to this class today .. my last class at the university .. it wasnt a class as such .. it was the last of the class presentations today and it was ok .. except for one guys presentation .. he got really nervous which was to be expected since the prof isnt a great guy .. but what annoyed me was the fact that 2 of the other students were laughing at him .. he was totally uneasy in the first place, even frustrated with his inability to come up with quick answers and this one guy was laughing at him .. quite unbecoming of a PhD candidate who is quite as intelligent and essential part of academia as that specific guy ..   so .. learning ... shud it be abt gaining experience ? or shud it be reading abt things and trying to keep this knowledge in mind for latter use or maybe just for lack of current purpose ? i think its all abt gaining experience ...

      I love the new blogger... cool ! gives me everything i want .. except stats ... but thats not what blogger is here for is it ? but then maybe ... im sure when they can provide me with webspace at blogspot.com .. they can also swing some deals to get me a counter ! maybe its already there ;) .. i think i'll find out later ..  for now .. exam was horrible .. not studying as much as possible does have its demerits .. but here i think the whole class didnt do so well .. im hoping so anyways .. coz otherwise my grade will suffer ... i know thats selfish and mean of me .. but right now .. im just hoping against hope .. o god ! help me ...   the posts here will probably increase in volume now that im done with my exams ... and job search re-starts with a renewed enthusiasm and vigour [vigor: hehe .. now americans can rest in peace]. life's awful confusing right now .. but i know better days shud be ahead .. somewhere .. in the distant future. im thinking - let me do what i can for now .. and when i close in on those nicer days .. i'll enjoy !   i hope someone comments .. uses the new comment link ive put up [courtesy: the new Blogger, yeah !] .. i do have a couple of regular users .. so lets hope one of them lets me know they were here.  Oh yes ... i wanted to put down why i write here ... why i maintain a blog ! the thing is .. i also maintain a private diary .. a place for more personal feelings and events and thoughts ... but this place gives me a public place to vent my superficial problems .. or share my worldly achievements with no one in particular .. i dont have to justify to anyone about anything that i write in here .. nobody needs to know why i think in a certain way abt things mentioned in here ... u c .. im more conscious of my public image and standing than i'd like to be .. and thats not changing anytime soon .. so maybe .. i need a place where i can put in any unbrideled, unrestricted thoughts of mine .. without any pressure .. without any prejudice .. without any consequence to bother about .. plus ! it helps me develop a personal writing style :). haha .. do u think this is irony that i write here for the above stated reasons and still am eager to see how the comments addition works out ?   a serious question abt myself:: am i too eager to please people ? .. obviously .. most of you wont know !

      it's so damn difficult to come to blogger almost a week after the last post and try to remember all the things you wanted to put in here ... the last week has been hectic and ive gotten really nothing to show for the back breaking work ... chances are all the work will go waste and i will be left with squat .. but thats fine .. i did my part and now its up to the powers that may be ! i have just one exam to give on monday after which i'll hopefully have completed every requirement for graduation. seems cool ! MS EE :) ... the same degree my dad has ... though his is from a much better university.  yeah ! so before i forget .. i want to write abt this incident that happened .. oh i guess last tue .. maybe monday ! im not sure ... i got up around 8:30 and after the regular "brush-my-teeth, head-to-the-loo" routine .. i was still very sleepy ... i got myself a nice hot cup of coffee and came and sat on the couch to watch the morning news ... inadverently .. i happened to hold the cup a certain way - with both my palms wrapped around the warm cup trying to soak the heat and energy of the hot coffee to soothe my palms .. it's a nice feeling .. and very innocently with the cup in my right palm .. i proceeded to touch the cup to my cheeks and eyes ... feeling the warmth .. trying to wake up and feel better than the groggy self i was ... now all this activity could remind me of only one person .. and it did :) ... hehe .. i know you are out there reading this .. and must be feeling nice abt the fact that i learnt this from you .. if u still do this every morning/evening .. keep doing it .. if u dont .. try it sometime again .. its just that small moment of happiness you need to kickstart a lazy morning ..  Other than this .. wow .. most of my week has been filled with oh so small things regarding the presentation and project report ... ive been in the library for 7+ hours continuous on more than a couple of occassions.. ive watched a few movies here and there ... and my cold and cough is gone .. well almost ... its on its way out ... thats abt it for now ... there were so many things i wouldve wanted to write but my memory is kinda uncooperative right now.. maybe later.. i slept at 4:30 last nite .. and got up at 9:30am .. hehe .. 5 hours of sleep .. but thats the best i could do .. i was awake at 8:30 but just couldnt get up .. my eyelids were as heavy as anything you could imagining .. and just would open !! so i let go and slept another hour .. now i think i'll be sleeping earlier than normal tonite ... or who knows !

      it's been a really long day ... ive been out since 9am and except for the one hour i spent at home from 5-6pm ... i havent eaten or had anything to drink ... all day ive been working on this project of mine for the simulation class ... and its just not working out ... i dont know why ! i guess in my usual exuberance to get things done .. im not paying full attention to the minute details .. just like me .. though for now .. for this project .. it needs to change a bit .. i need to get this done as quickly as possible otherwise i'll be screwed ... the grade will be worse than my gpa can tolerate and i'll be left back again ... that cannot happen .. so this project has to be made possible .. just 7-10 days to go before im free from these things ...   yesterday i went to a gathering of people in the northern parts of dallas downtown .. just a bit away from the downtown is this place called dallas theatre center ... they had this Art of Living gathering organized there ... and while my thoughts abt this event were completely neutral and unbiased before we started .. it was a wierd experience overall .. i went there for food .. and thought it would be a cool experience to go out to the downtown [we dont get to be in a big downtown as often !] ... the food was great .. the meeting also in some respects was decent .. all the people there were good too .. but the things they did .. I dont know .. I dont need to be in a group and pay good money to learn breathing techniques from anyone .. however good the person is .. not right now anyways ... maybe 5-10 years down the line .. when i actually have the stress levels out of control .. maybe then i'll pay up and do any courses in the "Art of Living" .. hehe ..   oh .. just an interesting fact for you :: Did you know that there's abt 7-8 different towns in USA called Delhi ? and 4 Bombays ! and 4 Calcuttas !! hehe .. this is a bit extraordinary.

      1. Check out the  urlLink "Movie Review Query Engine"  ... its a really cool thing that scours the internet for movie reviews for the movie of your choice. you shud give it a try .. 2. I just searched for movie reviews for Kill Bill Vol. I ... which i happened to see a few days back ... and i found the NYTimes review for it ...  and i agreed with one line so much ... that here it is :   "The film's detractors and its fans are likely to agree, however, that the movie, a densely referential pastiche of B-movie attitudes and situations, is above all an exercise in style."  -- A. O. SCOTT (N. Y. Times)  so true ... thats what it is !!  anyways .. enjoy finding what the critics have to say about your favorite movie.

      it's wierd .. but i actually wanted to go spend $10 and watch a hindi movie with shah rukh khan in it ... i have no reports on what the movie is about .. who else is in there ... but it seems to be the current hit in india ... this just came up last nite .. and i was in the mood to get out ... so i said yes .. but heavens disagreed and it poured like anything .. we had golf ball sized hail in the area and couldnt go .. this morning .. out of curiosity .. i ended up reading a preview ... and it doesnt look so good .. i hate the words " complete masala film " .. and it just ends there. so ive saved $10 and valuable sleep time by God's grace :).  Edit ::  urlLink Movie review for Main Hoon Na  [the movie i was to watch last nite !] at Mid-Day .. haha .. only phrase to describe the treatment the movie gets - "torn to shreds". o .. and btw ... the review is by Mid-Day but this is at the yahoo movies website.  Edit2 :: Y! India movies also has a  urlLink review by IndiaFM  for the same movie ... and how contrasting it is ... the Mid-Day review referenced above dislikes the movie like anything else is better ... while this review is all praises for it ... hehe .. i dont know how this works ... do these people get paid for writing particular reviews ? or it this just the difference between how two different people percieve things ? i hope its the latter .. though im still not watching the movie unless its on video for $1 .. haha

      I saw this gorgeous little kid right now. Sitting very comfortably in the arms of presumably the child's dad. I was walking towards the library and presumably the child's mom or atleast someone who was with the pair [child and dad like guy] walked past me to join them. I looked at the baby and the baby smiled at me ... smiled like it knew me. It smiled at me like it knew me from before and was happy to see me and would have said a big "Hello !" if it could've. All this made me smile so much.  And then the older guy said,"Youngest freshman ever!" That just capped a very beautiful moment in this really boring evening otherwise.

      I know .. no posts over the weekend and then some. Its been something, but the main things is current happenings are not open to public scrutiny. So I have kept away from here.   Anyways ... among all the activity going on is some good news. One of my roomies has bought himself a new car - a 2005 Toyota Corolla, Phantom Grey in color. Its a really cool car with loads of space inside and some cool features like an in-dash 6 CD changing player. He's moving out northwards into Kansas for his new job and that leaves just the three of us now. The original three of us ! The ones out started out together here at university. Its been an amazing ride guys, I hope I meet good people like you at all turns in my life.  Other than that, not much. Posts might be a bit scarce in the coming weeks, but then maybe not. July seems like a not-much-blogging month of sorts right now. I don't know why, just instincts I guess.

      There's a new book I'm reading -    urlLink I'm a stranger here myself: Notes on Returning to America After 20 Years Away  - by Bill Bryson  It's really good. It points out the various unique things about USA in a very endearing yet sarcastic way. He complains about how he's missed the USA as his home and remembers his childhood days while mocking and complaining today's USA in a very entertaining way. People from outside of the US can certainly relate to most of it. I will try and put up some of the things he talks about. The book's a collection of small essays and makes for very interesting reading though Americans might not enjoy all of it. It was originally written for the British audience.

      Everyone must have noticed how we swing our arms while walking. Left arm goes forward with the right leg and the right with the left leg. HAve you ever wondered why we do this? I guess to maintain balance?   Some people move them like throughout - shoulder to finger tips while some just move their hands, wrist onwards ! Its quite a characteristic how people walk .. very many individual styles. I find it wierd if I spot someone who's walking without moving his/her arms. Haha ... they _have_ to move their shoulders either way coz thats just natural for the way human beings walk.

      My dinner tonite was quite like the one served at one of these chain diners. I know Denny's for one, where they serve this quite American ensemble of eggs, potatoes and some meat. They have their different combinations of these three basic things where you can choose the style of eggs you want [omlette, scrambled, sunny-side up, etc], the kind of potatoes you would like [grits, hashbrowns, mashed] and then they give you bacon or sausage or ham or some such other meat with it.   My dinner was like one of these combos tonite, except I made everything at home. The time it took to make all this is what made me happy more than having cooked all of it at home myself. I made scrambled eggs with some milk in it, I had a hashbrown, some toasted wheat bread and washed it all down with some pineapple juice. The juice might not have been the best choice. In hind-sight, I might have enjoyed some warm milk with sugar more. All in all a pretty decent meal that took only 15 minutes to cook.   If you ever meet me, make me cook for you. I'd love to. Afterwards, if you live to tell, you can maybe tell the world what a great cook I am. haha ... just kidding.

      I made this dish for lunch today and I liked the way it tasted. I will certainly make some more again. I made small pizzas with normal wheat bread slices as base. I diced some green pepper and put on some onion rings and tomato slices. Topped all this with some oregano, salt 'n pepper and some red chilli flakes. Covered all this with big amounts of shredded Mozzarella ! YUM !! It tasted wonderful for something that worked out in an instant. Nothing - except the cheese - is indispensable. I might try something similar with the single garlic flavored burrito-wrap we have, just lying around in the fridge. Its not as thick as the bread but then that just makes it interesting.

      Hope  YOU  had a blast on your special day of the year !  A slightly amusing thing happened today. I was watching 'Seinfeld' re-run on TBS. In one scene Kramer picks up the phone and dials for Jerry. Hehe .. it just so happened .. that he finished dialing and the phone in my house rang. Almost like Kramer called me up instead of Bally's in Atlantic City where Jerry's supposed to be staying. :)

      It is really unbelievable, but you can get really bogged down and tired of doing 'nothing'. I have been hunting for a job for a month now and during these days, I haven't really kept myself up physically. I get up late, am seated most of the time in front of a computer and my hardest physical activity might be cooking or walking to the lab/library. Typing comes a close second. hehe .. and still I can easily sleep for 7 hrs every night and 1.5-2 hours maybe 3 times a week in the afternoons. Generally I will lose sleep even when the slightest lean patch in activity hits my days. Not this time. Today was extremely lethargic for some unknown mysterious reasons.  Yesterday turned out to be active. 'Lunch and a movie' at a local cinema hall turned out to be exceedingly profitable. The lunch was decent Indian fare, filling to say the least. Nothing was particularly extraordinary, but the ensemble of dishes was good enough to make lunch fulfilling. At one point I was worried about overeating and then sleeping through the movie. It was supposed to be a particular movie that was free when you paid for lunch. We had no clue. We were there thinking we'd get to see a movie of our choice. The 'ticket collector' [for all I know he could have been the owner of the place; I'm just trying to give him a designation describing his activity] pointed us to a particular hall, where a completely different movie was showing. My partner is this adventure was doubtful the whole time about wether we were in the right place. His fears turned out to be true and as soon as we realized our mistake, we walked out, promptly asked the guy where the correct film was and went and watched that movie. We had no clue that this movie wasn't for us. We only got to know about this when we got back from the whole thing. We effectively watched an $8 movie for free. We fooled the guy into letting us watch a new release without him or us knowing what was going on.  The movie was good.  urlLink "Lakshya"  is the new offering from the director of  urlLink "Dil Chahta Hai"  -  urlLink Farhan Akhtar .  Dil Chata Hai  was a cult hit of sorts which appealed more to the urban upper classes. It was an intricately woven story told beautifully by the debutant director. I loved the film and thus had high expectations from his latest film. Fortunately, I read the  urlLink Rediff.com review  of the film and thus agreed readily to watch the movie. After watching the movie, I've read a couple of other reviews which aren't so good. I loved the film though, with all it's shortcomings. The film does have some, but in the overall scheme of things they are not as bothersome. Like the songs and the apparent excessive length of the movie. The movie is much better than other war movies in that the storyline is much more subtle. The main aim of the movie is to show a boy's transformation from an aimless Indian youth to a responsible and mature officer in the Indian Army. The war scenes and the importance given to that track of story might not suggest so.   Hrithik Roshan does a wonderful job as the lead. All others are good too and the end result is a slightly long but very smooth flowing narrative. It certainly does not disappoint the discerning viewer though there is room for improvement. I loved the movie. I might not watch again, but it will certainly make me go watch the next Farhan Akhtar movie.

      Some really interesting and revealing blogging about outsourcing to India goes on at  urlLink BlameIndiaWatch . Today's post focuses on how the real issue at hand for the " downsized/rightsized/ laid-off/fired/canned I.T. people " here in the US is not the outsourcing but the misuse of their tax money for the improper operations of big corporations in post-war Iraq.   "Now, instead of using US I.T. worker's tax money to at the very least extend unemployment benefits, that money is being given away to waste agents such as Halliburton, which don't do the work they claim, yet charge the government."   Do read it, it is really eye-opening. I'm a proud Indian, so I've never understood this hatred or dislike people show towards India for all the outsourcing. It's not like India is the only country benefitting out of this situation. Outsourcing is done to so many countries and India is nowhere near the top of the list in terms of 'jobs taken away' or 'money made' out of business taken away from the US. I don't understand why China doesn't get any flak when they are manufacturing so many things for the US markets. As a matter of fact, you go to Walmart or the Dollar Shop and you can check this out for yourself. So many of the things are made in China, you wouldn't believe you were standing in a store located in the US. I don't want China or for that matter any country to be hated for business being outsourced to that country. It's just baffling to see how India is the only country targetted.

      Latest book I checked out from my library -    urlLink I'm Just Here for the Food: Food + Heat = Cooking    Looks amazing and I love his style on his TV show. I think I really get to learn a lot through his way of teaching. I'm not cooking yet, but I hope the book itself will be interesting to read.

      has this ever happened to you -  you pick up your phone (mobile or otherwise) to call a certain person and just at that moment the other person is calling you. I just picked up my mobile to call my roomie who had a job interview this morning. I just thought of him and decided it was a good time to call. So I picked up my cellphone and just when I was to start calling [he's on speed dial], the mobile rang, the screen glowed and displayed that this particular friend was calling. hehe ... how do you describe that in one word ? Am I psychic or telepathy works amongst us or what ? Not that it matters, the experience by itself is incredible and amusing.   At times it has so happened that I'm calling someone and that someone is calling me at the very same moment. We both find each other's phone lines to be engaged or are forwarded to voicemail. Just like it happened in "When Harry Met Sally". It is a common thing to happen once in a while, but I think its a bit mysterious when it happens out of the blue. Both of you have thought of each other at precisely the same time. Its even more incredible when its the same person at the other end of the communication attempt most of the times. Aaah ... I'm sure I'm reading into this more than I should :).

Don't complain." -Maya Angelou  "To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; to leave the world a little better; whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is the meaning of success." -Ralph Waldo Emerson

      Its been a pretty pleasant morning today. I have visited and added quite a few photoblogs to my favorites list. It was an exciting journey through some of the sites I browsed today.   I'm getting my degree and transcripts today. They have started giving them out. Nothing really surprising to be expected there. The feeling of having a piece of paper to prove you are a Master in your field is something totally exciting for a minute or so.  Yahoo increased its storage limits to 100MB which is very cool in itself. The fact that it comes months after the launch of Gmail is suggestive of the competition. I feel a bit disappointed in Yahoo. 100MB seems meager compared to the 1GB Gmail is giving out [will freely hand out once they are open for business]. Though a tenth of what Gmail is giving is also excessive for users like me, there is no fun in this competition. When you are competing with a big promise like Google's, you need to do better. If one company promises me a Gold car, you cannot hope to compete with a Gold plated car as your offering. You have to come out with a thicker Gold car or a Platinum car or atleast do as good as your competitor. Yahoo has certainly pleased long time space-starved users of its email system though. People have wanted more space to store their email for a long time. You have to thank Google for coming out with the 1GB concept, thatis what creater this competition in the first place.   I tried the Yahoo system today, its still a bit slow. Its not settled into the bigger space thing and they have changed the appearance also. It looks much much better now and I've said for a long time that they needed an overhaul in the looks dept. I hope Yahoo can do better with time. I'm seriously rooting for them. They've been around for too long to just fade away because of Google.  A complete change of subject. Have you ever seen a potato plant? I'm surprised that I have never ever seen a potato plant or field, never seen a freshly harvested potato. And to think of it, potato is probably the most commonly used vegetable around the world. Did you know that half of the world's potato is grown in Russia, Poland, China and India together? haha ... there's so many interesting facts out there about the most mundane of things. I'm extremely surprised at never having seen a potato plant.

      It has been a pretty dull day for me. I got my friend’s vehicle registration sticker renewed. I’ve not done much else throughout except a visit to the public library to return some stuff I had checked out earlier. I loved the Harry Potter movie though the non-fiction book was not quite to my liking. I checked out another non-fiction book this time on a completely different subject. Food – something that interests me immensely. I had been sitting at home reading the book. The book was interesting but I switched to watching TV for sometime. The evening was growing duller as time went by and I’d been watching TV for some time now.   Finally I freshened up and ventured out, my book in my hand. The tentative plan was to get to a bench near the library and read. It was early evening and sunset was more than an hour away. Normally the place saw its fair share of people in the evenings during spring and fall semesters. Not many people frequented the place on summer evenings though and this quietness was a big draw for me. I would sit there for around an hour or so, looking around, observing people, reading my book and in general enjoying a peaceful evening.

      Hmm ... no post yesterday. I was pretty active for most part of the day. I didn't find the time to write through the various interesting events of the day. Though writing is fun and clears my mind, physical aspect of it is not as tiring as is necessary to put me to sleep at night. I hate the restless feeling I get when I've not had enough physical activity. It causes me to have sleepless nights when my legs are just rearing to go for a run or my arms are eager to shoot some hoops or something. Right now, what adds to my enigmatic zeal is that the NBA playoffs are on. I watch every game and it just enthuses me when I watch the Pistons running all over the court and the Lakers. It makes me want to go and shoot some hoops myself, not that it counts.  I am passionate about hard-work. I am emotional [to the slight extentof emotional vulnerability that I allow for myself] about anything that puts to use or tests human physical ability. Sports, Military, even Farming. I appreciate anyone who shows skills of the most basic kind. Endurance, for me, shines as a quality. Any activity that wills human body and mind to achieve exemplary objectives stirs me.  I shud be writing about the race and the game last nite. But you all know already what happened. Schumi won again through some really good racing strategy. I didn't get to see the race live but it must have been really rocking cause schumi qualified sixth on the grid. The basketball last night was just awesome. Lakers and Pistons went at each other till three full quarters. They were 56 all at the end of 36 minutes of play. And then 'Sheed showed up. He along with other Pistons players made a run. They took a lead and kept it safe till the end of the game to win 88-80. Just another game filled with tough defense and good enough offense from Detroit. I'll even say that Lakers have really stunk it up till now. People were expecting them to win - and look what we have here.  Euro Championships started recently. I will only get to see a few free highlights that show up on the website. Hope the competition is good. No favorites coz I haven't followed soccer for some time now. Still ... all teams should do well to make for a highly watchable tournament.

      There’s a dialogue in “When Harry Met Sally”. Harry and Sally have slept together for the first time the earlier night. They both think it’s a mistake and admit it to each other over dinner.  Then there’s a silent pause as Harry’s busy eating his ‘Mixed Greens Salad’ as is Sally who seems a bit annoyed that the conversation ended so abruptly without much discussion. The pause continues, and then Harry says, “It is so nice when you can sit with someone and not have to talk”. This particular sentence reminded me of the definition of a good friend that a friend of mine once gave me. I asked her how she categorized friends and what was the defining factor for a friend to be close or good etc, you get the point. She said, “Good friends are those with whom you could sit for hours without saying a word”. I being the silent guy that I am identified with this definition a lot. I’d never heard someone put it this way before and I loved it. Formula1 drove into Montreal, Canada today. Its been a Schumi-Ferrari show till now though it looks like this race maybe a complete reversal in fortunes. Michael Schumacher and Ruebens Barichello qualified a lowly [for them anyways] 6th and 7th today. Ralf Schumacher qualified at pole. I don’t know who else has done well enough to be ahead of Ferrari on the grid. Oh, by the way, did you know these cars rev at 17,000+ rpm? For some unknown reason, this [useless] fact excited me like nothing else this afternoon while watching the end of qualifying. I’m going to try out the use of index cards as suggested by Anne Lamott. Maybe they’ll help me a bit more in my writing endeavors. For now, my card shows me that human thoughts are generally so incoherent. When we say our mind is blank, our thought train is going so fast, we can’t comprehend each and every station it stops at, if at all it stops. Also the topics are so varied and rave, it hardly makes sense.

      Last night I went to the Hindu temple that we frequent. After the regular prayers [begging for mercy and goodness] I was sitting down on a mat and observing what others were doing. It was very interesting to observe the people around me and come up with so many things worth writing down. I seriously felt the lack of a notepad or index cards and a pencil. It would have been worth noting down certain characteristics of people and so many other interesting things going on in there.  Many different deities reside at this particular temple site. The various statues are placed in their own small ‘houses’, all in one big hall. India is a very culturally diverse country. Almost every region in India has their own deities and customs regarding religion and prayer. Whenever I go there, I stand at a particular place where I’m facing all the Gods in the temple and I pray to all of them simultaneously. I don’t believe in the multiple manifestations of Gods. I mean almost every person has a form to one’s own God. My God doesn’t conform to any of these visual manifestations. My beliefs regard God as an energy without any form. This is the true description of God given by my religion. So it does not matter to me if I pray to all of them at once. It is of trivial importance then, that I’m even standing there. I could pray anywhere in the world as God is also ubiquitous. What I noticed last night at the temple though was two types of people. There were some who would go to all deities in one particular order, say clockwise. One little temple after another, they would pray in front of each of the idols separately. It is a bit amusing to me because for me the idols are just the different forms of God. The prayer for one manifestation might be different than all others but at some level of abstraction we are all asking for the same thing. These people would go in front of each possible statue in the temple and go through the same ritual through and through. I could understand if they were praying for different things from different gods but I don’t think they were. There are approx. 10 different statues in there. By the time you got to the last one I’m sure you’d have repeated your requests over and over.  Then there was the other sort. They were the ones who believed there was a single God but also believed in praying to only a particular appearance of Him. They would walk into the hall and straight in front of their favorite idol. They would go stand there and pray and then walk away, no “hi, hello” to all the other Gods in the hall who deserve at least that! These people, in my understanding, believe that they have their own idea of what God looks like and they will only pray in front of that particular idol and leave it at that. Religion and Prayer are really controversial subjects open to individual interpretation. My comments here do not reflect my judgement on how people pray neither are the types given above examples of any wrong sort of praying. I just wanted to say that everyone has their own style and these specific ones amused me.

      Did you see the way Detroit just suffocated the Lakers offense? Oh my god ! I mean when was the last time you saw such tight and stingy defense win so convincingly against such a star-studded prodigious offense? Not since the Jordan-Pippen era has the East been so convincing in its bid for the NBA championship. Awesome ... go Pistons.  Finished reading  urlLink  Bird by Bird  by Anne Lamott . Good book. I must say I learnt a lot about writing and professional writers in particular. I'm continuing with non-fiction though I've gone to a story this time. No more instructions, hehe. The story of six MITians has captured my interest for now.  urlLink  Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions   by Ben Mezrich describes how a group of former MIT students legally took away millions from casinos in gambling. They used something called 'card counting' to up their winning percentages considerably and beat the system in Vegas. Should be extremely riveting.

      Right now, life is going ok. I want and need stuff and that never ends. The three things I'd love to have the most right now are the "three  C s" in my life. Don't get me wrong, there are other things I crave for, but if I land a decent job somewhere, these are the things coming in during the first six months. They are:   A Car - for obvious reasons, Computer - I can't be offline for long, Camera - I will get desperate to shoot as time goes on.  Oh how I would love to be able to pay for these on my own.

      Is it just me or does this happen to everyone? I keep finding these pennies all around. The  lucky  penny. hehe. I don't know what to do with this coinage that keeps happening my way. Is there something you are supposed to do so that the promised luck shows up in certain needed ways? Like you wish for something when you see a shooting star or you wish for something when you blow off your birthday candles. Well if not anything else, I've made atleast a dollar or two in found lucky pennies till now :).  Its been raining since afternoon now. Just pouring in at a steady rate. Not much water has come our way, but the climate has been perfectly rainy. I saw the sherlock Holmes movie I rented. Its more a video of a TV show than a movie. Anyways. Sherlock Holmes finds himself unable to overcome the blackmailing endeavours of a certain Mr. Charles Augustus Milverton. The name reminds me of Colonel Julius Nagendranath Wilfred Singh, hehe, from the Hindi movie Choti Si Baat. Finally having exhausted all his possible means of solving the case, he just goes in one night, robs the blackmailer and burns all his loot. These are the letters based on which he's been troubling people. There's a side-track too, but maybe you should read or watch it. The name -  The Master Blackmailer .  After the video, I went up to get some reading done. This book - Bird by Bird - is really interesting and teaches a lot of things. I laid down on my bed reading. The rain outside just made it perfect to be sitting near a window and reading and drinking a hot beverage or something. Its just one of those things people love to do on a rainy afternoon. If you are from Pune [my place in India], you would probably go out to Sinhagad or Khadakwasla or Mulshi [all nearby places of interest] to get wet and enjoy some hot snacks and tea. Its almost like a ritual with so many people out there. We just love to get out and enjoy the rains [though some of us like yours truly don't like to get wet]. I remembered all those activities, lying there on the bed, the book in my hands.  I turned my pillows over to the other side. Earlier I was sleeping with my feet towards the east and now my head was towards east. This gave me a better view of the rain outside rather than having to stare into the staircase of the neighbouring apartment. It was wonderful. This weather just makes me sleepy and thats just what happened. I dozed off only to get up 2 hours later. The deep slumber was so deep, someone might have mistaken me as being anesthetized. The rain was really cool though. Everything is soaking wet outside. The trees are beautiful in all their glory and various magnificent shades of green. The asphalt streets instead of being hot are cool, wet and dark grey. The white and yellow street markers are all clean and bright. The streets are sporting small streams flowing along the sides. The grass is lush and moist and it all just comes together to make this place enchanting and enticing.

      I know - no post yesterday. What I don't know is "why?". Anyways ... Did you see the Lakers last nite? Oh forget about the Lakers and the Pistons for a moment. Concentrate on Kobe Bryant. He is  THE MAN . Who other than Michael Jordan has saved his team so many times in the fourth quarter in the last decade?   I expected Kobe to drop that three on the Pistons any moment on the last play in regulation. It wasn't surprising at all, what was surprising though is that Rip Hamilton couldn't do anything to stop Kobe. He couldn't even make it a bit difficult for Kobe to get his shot off. Kobe shot like it was a practice game or a school game or something. So easily. So smoothly.   And Detroit and Hamilton are supposed to be the best defence around in the league. Surely they weren't thinking about guarding Shaq. Larry Brown has come up with this amazing strategy to not double team Kobe or Shaq and let them score whatever number of points they want to. It will succeed most of the times no doubt. But hey !! you are up by just three you schmuck. You know its going to be Kobe ... why in the name of God did you leave a tired defender on him !! the least you could do was the double team him.  I know - hindsight is always 20/20. But it just pains me to have seen the Pistons lose last night. They erased a double digit lead to almost win it in regulation. I hope the series goes to seven games. As I see it - its even now. Very difficult to predict who will win. Brown's strategy is working wonders and the Pistons just need to keep scoring. For once guys, just score 91 points. I'm sure you'll have won the game.

      I wish I was like one of those characters from a WB serial. Articulate and exact. Absolute. These characters, all mostly in their teens [not that it matters], are always sure of what they want to say and the correct words just pop out of their mouths like they've known this is the best thing to say in the given situation. Some times I can predict what the character will say but most of times I'm left imagining about what to say while the character has already said the perfect little sentence and moved on.  My problem is I cannot put my ideas into words effectively all the time. I do not lack in vocabulary [hopefully] and I have a command of the language. Its just that at any given time, I always have options for myself and I like to choose one of the best. The thing is - this choice is very difficult. Im very capricious when it comes to deciding whats best. I cannot for the life of me decide why something is the best.   These characters on these TV shows on the other hand - they know just what to say. I know these dialogues are written and perfected after hours of deliberation and hard work. But the characters, when they put out these ideas in the show, seem so fluent, so perfectly expressive of their feelings. Most of the times I cannot even adequately define how I'm feeling.  Just to put you all in perspective as to what TV show triggered this post - its Dawson's Creek. But you can take any other serial on TV right now and I'm sure it'll be the same.

      Finished reading  Fight Club . Good book ... not for everyone. The central theme of the book is confusing for me and I didn't totally understand the point the author was trying to make. Other than that, whatever I did understand was really good. Chuck Palahniuk is really creative if this is really his first novel ever.  Here are some  urlLink quotes from  Fight Club  .  Next book -  Bird by Bird , by Anne Lamott.   Its about instructions for writers. hehe ... I don't know if I'm seriously going to take up writing, but I feel I have an interest in knowing what it  means  to be a writer. That is what this book promises.

      How is this idea?   You add up all the money in the world. Everybody in the world - e v e r y b o d y - gives up everything that is worth anything in money. You convert all the belongings of every person into some ubiquitous form of money and pile it all up.   Whatever total you get, you divide it by the number of people in the world. Each person gets this amount in return. We start life on earth as equals.   Fresh start.   Everyone gets the world average of wealth. There's no poor or rich in the world. All the houses are re-alloted and bungalows or mansions are not allowed. Everyone gets units for themselves.  Re-start.  Whoever is destined to be rich will find a way to get rich after this overhaul. Whoever wants to be poor will donate or lose their money in due time. The least we will have achieved is for everyone to start off on the same level.  Just an idea.

      Dum Aloo: A potato dish originally from the Kashmir region in extreme North India. Characterized by the very small sized soft [after cooking] potatoes and the various flavorful spices including saffron, it is a very tasty preparation. haha .. why am i telling you all this? Well we tried making something similar today for lunch .. and though whatever turned out was decent fare, it was not Dum Aloo. Anyways .. we thoroughly enjoyed what we made with some rice and later on, some ice cream. Pretty good for us bachelors :)

      It’s been a different week all together! I worked at the bookstore for some hours on Tuesday and Thursday. Friday was movie night [ Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban : did I write about the movie? really cool] and plus we enjoyed some relaxing time at the lake nearby. Saturday was cool too - went to the library in the afternoon, Wal-mart and then Ft Worth all of which was fun. Dinner was out last nite and that was cool too. We tried out this new place called Don Pablo’s. I guess it’s a chain but I wont bet on it. Later on they had karaoke night at the bar which was amusing too. We capped off the night with some enjoyable time at the lake again. All this worked out to just tire me off to sleep in a jiffy when we finally got home.  The past week has flown by very fast. The consequence has been mostly less writing here though I don’t think it shows. I’ve written something [if not everything] but maybe the regulars have noticed that I’ve just written about fringe things, the sundries. There’s been so many things I’ve been doing [well come to think of it, I’ve been doing a few things a number of times] that I’m losing out on all the memories of even a single day. I cannot recount yesterday as effectively as I’d like to. Well I can, but the effort it would take me to do so is more than I’d like to take.  Anyways … yesterday was sporting “bad luck” day or something? The Calgary Flames lost a home game to let Stanley Cup chances slip and Smarty Jones lost out on the Triple Crown at the Belmont Stakes. I had my hopes up for both wins to come through. I guess both the teams in the NHL Finals are underdogs but Calgary just appeals a bit more to me. They are Canadians so they are the underdogs amongst the two. That’s my reasoning, I don’t know how many of you will agree with that. As for Smarty Jones, I haven’t the slightest clue about horse racing but I know how the Triple Crown hasn’t been won for a lot of years now. So I wanted this horse to win just to break that streak.  Well, at least the Rangers beat the Yankees convincingly! That was one good thing yesterday. The focus is on the Lakers-Pistons finals now. They start tonight and its going to be a really good series. I’m hoping for one. Detroit is positively miles ahead of the league in defense with their shot blocking antics and the Lakers meanwhile are near the top of the league in offense. The NBA finals bring together two oppositely polarized teams with two equally accomplished coaches. Its certainly one of the better East-West finals we could expect in these post-Bulls years of West’s dominance over the league. Last year’s finals were such a drag, I hope they are much better this year. All said about how good the Pistons are, they will find it a mighty task to stop Shaq and Kobe. I predict a Lakers championship in 6 games though it would thrill me no ends to see a Game 7 in LA.  [Edit]: Yeah baby ... Mr. David Aldridge of ESPN also  urlLink predicts the same results  as I do for the Lakers-Pistons NBA finals. Lakers in 6. The link might not be permanent, so please don't blame me if it does not work.

      Why am I confused about so many things in life? Why is life so full of questions that I must find answers to in order to be any happier or have peace of mind? Why does perfect and exact knowledge put me to rest? Does this happen to everyone? Why has God made me? What is the purpose of life?   I'm sooo confused at times, I don't even know what I'm thinking about and why I'm thinking about it. The hardest of times for anyone are those spent aimless and workless. I know, its heaven to be just sitting around watching tv and eating food someone made for you, BUT only when you work your ass off at other times. If you were to just sit around doing nothing at all, I bet you'd feel restless pretty soon.  I read somewhere yesterday that a good way to write is to start writing rather than to think of writing. Its a quote of some famous personality. I liked it - its witty. I've made all this effort in bloggery [like pottery?] just to see if I have any potential in writing. Until now, I haven't seen a hint of talent.   I've been reading  Fight Club  and listening to the audiobook of  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets . Don't be shocked if I say I haven't really liked any of the two. I like the subjects, the stories, the theme of the books. No doubt about that. The books don't hold me or captivate me though. They just rattle on about the story providing really banal minutia. I know - to make the story vivid and alive, you need to write about such things. What I don't understand is if these things don't matter in the story, shouldn't you just leave their form and properties to the imagination of your reader ? What use is it if I describe to you the really ornate glass ceilings of the temple I frequent, if all I'm trying to say is I get peace of mind when I pray? I hope you get my point.  Fight Club looks like strong idea. Its not for everyone and I haven't fully grasped what the author is trying to say. I'm only 20% through the book, so its difficult to judge yet. Its creative to say the least. I'm really excited about the movie tonite. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Movies are so convenient to enjoy unlike the books. I mean, you can just sit through a movie and enjoy the visuals rather than follow the story line.

      It seems like a long time since I wrote in here. Since I graduated, I've taken the time to write in almost everyday. I didn't write yesterday but there wasn't really a reason as such. I worked at the college bookstore on Tuesday and today and I'll be making some money [hardly any really] of out that.   Recently I've frequented the public library nearby for books and videos. I finally managed to check out the  Fight Club . I've wanted to get my hands on this book for some time now. I've heard so much about it that I've been really curious about why its so special. So I have the book now and I've started on it. Lets see how that goes.  I also have  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets . I got that as an audiobook on CD at the library. I could not watch the movie and getting my hands on a DVD/CD/VHS has been tough. So I thought, "Why not try the audiobook instead !" I figured I could continue doing other stuff online while I listened to this book and its always nice to have someone read you a story :).  Work at the bookstore wasn't tough at all. Tuesday was busy though, while today was really empty. Hardly any customers in the store today and so the manager let me go early. It was a different experience and I'm sure I'd get used to it if I put in enough hours.

No one likes the  "big picture"  people coz no one has the slightest clue about what the big picture is. Even the people who think they are in this category only have questions about the big picture and like Calvin try to use these questions knowing fully well that no one has the answers. No one has the answer to the last  why .

      What a day ! I've worked at the bookstore from 9am to 6pm. Its been wonderful to be back in action and work all day although a bit tiring. That's ok I guess, I'm making enough money to stay here for 15 days .. hehe.  Anyways .. I dont have much to write about right now. I just came in to check my mail and stuff. so ... later.  [Edit:] oh yeah ! part of my horoscope for today goes like this:    "... Larger forces seem to be at work shaping your destiny and remaking the world according to your dreams. Seize each opportunity as a brilliant gift from the gods. Get into the habit of believing. ..."   haha .. what do you make of it ?

      As I use Mozilla Firebird [now called Firefox] more and more, I'm falling in love with it. It's just so much cleaner and simpler to use. It gives me tabbed browsing and integrated Google search. A pop-up blocker is included in the browser and it has less clutter in the toolbar [at least I feel so]. I discovered a new thing right now - I can open all my bookmarks into tabbed windows in a single click. I think its wonderful. Moreover I think I'm just a bit tired of IE and its flaky behavior at times. I think this browser suits me more. I think I've been satisfied with IE coz I have been using it for a long time now. Just like I prefer PCs to Macs. I don't know why ! I haven't even used a Mac long enough to form an opinion. Anyways - Firefox it is now onwards.

      We have a few fellas coming in. They've shifted almost everything and it'll be complete over this weekend. It's going to be a bit crowded now on, but the rent will come down like anything. Yesterday and today have been a bit hectic, with a lot going on at home. I think some residual stuff will trickle on to the weekend, but that should not be much.   Weekend movie plans include  urlLink The Village , the new movie by M. Night Shyamalan. I don't know the story yet, nor the plot, but whatever I've heard and seen about the movie seems good. It should be another good movie from the young director.  Oh yes - after 2 days of rain, the skies are blue again with some white clouds strewn about probably just for show. Its nice and warm again, like summer should be. It'll probably get back to being hot like earlier.

      I'm considering a template change, considering being the key word. I don't really look into my blog as much these days, but I have a feeling that you people might get bored of the same look all the time. I also need to figure out how Blogger presents my archives. I have a feeling they show them in their original templates.

      Have you heard about  urlLink Orkut  ? The "social networking" website that helps build a "trusted, online community". If you've never heard of it, you should find out something about it. It's nothing really new - maybe you know about  urlLink Friendster . I know they've been around for quite some time and I've known the concept since they actually came out with the service. But you see, only recently [today] have I been "special" enough to get an invitation. Plus, Orkut is a Google baby - it's developer is a Google employee.  Now that I'm a new member of this  invitation only  online community, I don't know what to make of it. Its in beta stages right now and hardly runs properly for more than a minute at a time. So going through everything can be a tough task. When you register, they ask you to fill out tons of forms about yourself. Maneuvering through all the links is a bit tough when your session keeps ending every 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. These seem to be temporary problems though. There are a few reviews out there saying what a cool site it is and how its better than others out there.  Here's  urlLink one review  and  urlLink here's another .  I'm giving the whole thing a week or so during which I will try out the various features on the website. If things work out, I'll continue. Otherwise, I really haven't understood the concept in the first place. Isn't my normal social network enough for me? Hell, even that's a bit more than I want to handle at times!

      Following are parts of my daily horoscope at  urlLink Yahoo! Astrology . Now I'm not a strong believer in&nbsp;astrology and the predictions, I take it at face value and enjoy&nbsp;if its something nice [which it generally is]. If they predict something bad I forget about it. Through this past weekend, I've gotten&nbsp;really wierd predictions though. Check 'em out.  Jul 24 - You're due for a lovely surprise tonight, most likely in a group situation. Someone you've only thought of platonically may be seeing you in an entirely different light. Ready?   Jul 26 - You may not have expected a drastic change in a formerly platonic relationship -- but it's en route. If you've been wondering about it, wonder no longer. You're not crazy. They're flirting.   Jul 27 - That dance you've been doing with a much older or younger person? Those barely disguised comments you've been exchanging? They're real. Time to decide what you want to do next.   Now I understand the face value these predictions have and that I'm not supposed to think of it. But you see, when something like this comes up, its quite intriguing. The mystery -&nbsp;of who this person could be -&nbsp;is&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;hard to solve. I've raked my brains without any positive results as to the identity of this person. Its really ridiculous what I've done, so I'm just going to stop bothering.

      What a fabulous weekend. A road trip, to a dear friend's place, with two other dear friends in the car with me. Drive, travel, eat out and laugh all the time. Its something thats very dear to me and I enjoy it anytime, everytime.   We drove to  urlLink Wichita, KS  which is approx. a 6 hr drive from here. It was a really fun drive till the rain got to us. It was really heavy downpour [is that one word?] and I don't exactly remember why, but we didn't bother to stop. We just wanted to get out and reach&nbsp;Wichita at the earliest. We made it pretty much in time even though the rain delayed us by at least half an hour. My driving style was a good mix of mature and rash, hehe. At times I was driving 100+ mph while at other times slow drivers made me go 50 mph, but thats a different story.   Wichita is a nice little place. Kansas itself ain't too big I guess, personally I don't know, but I liked what I saw. It's one of those small time big cities if you know what I mean. It's got all the amenities a big town has, but the look, feel and space of a smaller&nbsp;city. Its the big city in its area, surrounded by really big farms all around. It is mighty big industrially too, just that it doesn't show. Many people don't even know Wichita by name or that it is in Kansas. Most of my friends asked me if I visited Wichita Falls here in Texas. I am surprised. I mean yes, I've known about Wichita quite recently, but I've known Wichita as a city for quite some time now.   We reached there&nbsp;early [very early - 3 am] on Saturday&nbsp;morning. After some sleep, we went to the  urlLink Sedgwick County Zoo . Before that we took in some delicious Chinese/Thai [I couldn't tell, there was no discernable coconut or curry powder or pepper to call it Thai] food. It was a big buffet and I went about sampling everything that looked appetising. The zoo was really good too. We went through all the exhibits. The zoo had pretty much all the animals you would expect to see but it was a new experience for me here coz I'd never been to an American zoo before. It was wonderful.   Evening was spent watching  urlLink "I, Robot"  after having downed some pizza at a local Pizza Hut. Little did I know then that Pizza Hut originated just 5 min away from where I was enjoying it. Yes ! Pizza Hut started in Wichita and next day [Sunday] we actually saw the place where it's supposed to have started.&nbsp;I was&nbsp;sceptical of the whole scene then but now I've confirmed. The movie was nice - a typical summer action flick. I hope humans have complete control over how they allow their computers to evolve. The story line is pretty old - based on a Isaac Asimov novel. No movie critique here though, this is about my trip :).   On Sunday, we visited Wichita State University. A nice place, pretty big and clean. We didn't really get into any classrooms but overall the Univ. seemed a nice campus to be at. Downtown, whatever little there is, beckoned. We had to see the downtown otherwise we couldn't say we'd been to a city, could we? :) It's an OK place, certainly bigger than what we have here, it at least felt like a downtown. Lunch was Chinese again though a different place.   Overall the trip rocked. It gave us some time away from the drudgery of life and I always love driving. Drive I did and oh how I drove! I set the highway on blaze at times. We had this friendly race with a cute gal in a Jetta. Fun, I tell you. A great weekend raced away in the company of great friends in the comely city of Wichita, KS.

      Oh my, today's lunch time presented me with a unique challenge. I had some ingredients but apparently nothing to go with one another. I finally decided to go with a hashbrowns and Boca burger sandwich. I personally don't like Boca burgers [made with soy protein, they don't particularly&nbsp;appeal to my taste buds], but that was the only protein readily available in the fridge.   I had to prepare some kind of dressing for the sandwich. I got mayonnaise, ketchup, buttermilk, jalapeno, onion and carrots. I added some salt, black pepper powder&nbsp;and garlic powder to this mix and put it instead of just the ketchup and mayonnaise. This ensured that the bits of vegetables didn't fall off while eating. It also formed a kind of glue to hold on to the patties. I got two hashbrowns, one Boca burger and a cheese single.   Lo and behold, I had a wonderful sandwich like never before that went down very easily into my empty stomach. Only thing to enhance this dish would be your favorite drink [soft, hard, i don't care which !]. I couldn't find any at home and was thus left thirsty.

      This is the story of when we finally won the State Junior title in water polo. I had&nbsp;joined the team just recently and it was probably my 3rd or 4th major tournament. I had played at major tournaments before with the same team but this was the meet when all of us actually came together to form a real team,&nbsp;a cohesive unit.   We&nbsp;had some experienced players, but most of us were there for the 1st or 2nd time. We had that enthusiasm and will to win thats always there in players who've never lost close matches or not played at the highest level before. We were very excited to be there, be a part of the biggest tournament we'd seen.&nbsp;We as a club/city team had&nbsp;always shared top honors with another city. There was a&nbsp;rivalry between the teams though&nbsp;no one&nbsp;would&nbsp;admit to it publicly. Every win, either of our teams got, was cherished at least until the next time we met. We'd been beaten the last couple of&nbsp;times and it was time to get the title back. The rival team was very strong and it would be a tough task to get past them to lay our hands on the trophy.  Most of us were looking upto&nbsp;the senior players&nbsp;to tell us what to do and we would follow. The most notable difference though, was that this team leadership would give us a free reign to do things our way. We had strong basics and everyone was really hungry for a win. The seniors in the team gave everyone the freedom to express this hunger. We were all in the water one time or the other and we proved our worth. We did whatever we could to ensure a win. Every game that we played was do-or-die for us.   I was the goal-keeper. Our team had always been strong defensively and so I rarely got to save any shots. The ball would always deflect off of players hands. That day it was somewhat different. Everybody got to make crucial plays, including a few very important stops from me. The rival team had all but one national level players and we were just beginners compared to them. Still we found a way to defeat our accomplished opponent through team work.  This years Detroit team that won the NBA title reminded me of my teams back home. My world was much smaller then, but to me, those winning teams were just as great as this Detroit team. I remember that a year or two after this tournament we went into the National Varsity games as losers. We had lost the earlier year to another team and that loss was generally considered as the most stupid loss&nbsp;our team had suffered, ever.&nbsp;That was just the motivation our team needed that year. We romped through the competition in adverse conditions. I didn't allow any goals through the tournament and overall we allowed just 4 goals in 5 matches. To give you an indication of our dominance on the tournament, we scored about 50 goals on our opponents through those same 5 games. We were just unbeatable that year. Nobody could've stopped us.   Whenever I see&nbsp;success stories in sports, I'm reminded of my teams. We were dominant at&nbsp;our level and we won whatever there was to be won. It was a great feeling of male bonding and camaraderie as well as the joy and pride of winning at the highest levels. I will never, ever,&nbsp;forget those days in my life.

      Some people so plainly lack enthusiasm that its really tiring to be around them. I mean they do not appreciate their surroundings or that they are living and are completely consumed by some petty worldly problem like family problems or lack of employment. There are thousands of problems out there unique to each person. In all their worries and tensions, they forget that they are missing out on clean air in the park, the gorgeous spring flowers, some awesome sports maybe. I doubt if such people have a hobby of their own. Their life is ridden with so much reality that their own conscience pinches them with guilt everytime they try and enjoy some little thing.   I am currently unemployed but I have faith that I am doing or at least learning and trying&nbsp;to do everything thats in my control. Beyond those efforts I do not sit and crib about my condition. I try and show enthusiasm about everything that interests me - eating out, going to the park, movies , shopping, visiting friends. My excitement about these things doesn't wane suddenly because I don't have a job. Its like punishing someone for someone else's mistakes.  Anyways, moving on. How 'bout 'em&nbsp;Rangers ! In first place with a 6 game lead. Its really nice to see such a downtrodden team rise and be counted. Especially after A-Rod left at the start of the season. He was supposed to be a saviour on this team, instead it now seems like he was the anchor here. The Rangers are so free in their play now, all of them on the same level, they are a much more cohesive unit. Hopefully they'll make the playoffs this time. I think it's been a long drought.

      They have this wonderful SAE racing car kept on display at the library. I haven't been here since the weekend and a general guess would be they did it sometime then. They have some events planned for the coming weekend which are very much worth a watch. I might be travelling elsewhere though, so its no use.  Seeing this beautiful piece of engineering reminded me of my layover at the Amsterdam [Schiphol] airport. We [my brother was travelling with me] had about 4 hours to kill before our onward flight. The airport is big and very entertaining. We were just going around looking at interesting things. Around one turn we found this big Formula1 racing car on display. We are both big fans of Formula1 and had never seen a car live till then. Imagine our faces, we were just too happy. I couldn't believe my eyes. I think it was one of the Renault team cars though I'm not sure anymore.  Racing cars are just so different. They have some kind of an aura around them. I feel a certain kind of energy the moment I see one. I dream of getting to sit in one someday, even if just for a ride. Oh if only ...

      There's so much going on right now regarding finding a job for myself. Everyday I get a word or two of advice and suggestions to do that "something different" from someone or the other. I met my teacher from last semester right now. He's an Indian too, a Ph.D. student here. He's pretty accomplished I must say and has done well for himself till now. His advice means something. He came out and said I should do what most others are doing today. Join some staffing firm which will atleast give me some time to think about other prospects I might have. All this makes sense, but I'm not confident enough about the abilities of these firms as well as how things will work out if I can get a job with one of them. It was surprising for me that my teacher came and talked to me, remembered me from a class of atleast 75-80 students. &nbsp; Another quite amusing thing that happened right now. I was walking into the computer lab at school and this guy was going the other way. We exchanged glances, I said "Hello!" like I normally do in such cases. He looked back at me and said,"Hook 'em Horns". I was wondering why he said that and then walked through the door. The glass door reflected my Longhorns cap. That's what prompted him to greet me that way. Quite amusing.

       I just went swimming today after a long long time. Well, not that long a time, but still considerable. I'm famished right now after swimming just 500mts. I think it's because I haven't been near a pool in a while. To get those of you who don't know [which is 99.99%] up to date, I've been swimming since a pretty young age of three. Kudos to my mom for introducing me to one of the most pleasing activity I have known. I started learning at the age of three and pretty soon I was swimming competitively in age group meets. I did so along with school for some years before I just got bored of the whole competition thing. For some reason I did not want to go to the pool anymore to practice hard and compete. I couldn't find the pleasure I had come to expect everytime I entered the pool. I stopped short of the nationals then having grabbed a medal or two at state level meets. Had I continued I would have most certainly gone to the nationals and who knows maybe even could have&nbsp;won something !  &nbsp;  I was 11 then. Though I was above average at what I did, I wasn't ever enamoured by the glamour that came with winning. I always saw the hard practice that went into winning. I loved swimming and the camaraderie of the team, but was very lazy to go through the rigours of that lifestyle. My mother resigned to the fact that I did not want to continue with competitive swimming. I got away from the pool for the next 7-8 yrs. I didn't completely stop swimming though whatever I did was always for fun and way apart in time to be considered consistent or for fitness. It was much better having to do it on&nbsp;warm summer evenings to cool off or maybe somewhere on a camping trip in a lake. This was much more fun than swimming 3 kms every evening and maybe even more while preparing for a meet.  &nbsp;  I went back to the pool around the start of junior college.&nbsp;I had heard that my school had the best waterpolo team in town. I had known waterpolo since my early swimming days. I used to watch some very senior players who played at the same pool in those days. They were very good and the club team and its players did very well at all levels of the game. They even played for India at the Asian games in 1982 which is just an&nbsp;awesome achievement. So the pool always had this environment conducive to making waterpolo players. I decided this was the game for me. I already knew the basics of swimming and the only thing I would have to learn was the rules of the game.  &nbsp;  I was really excited to have joined the club. We were a select few who were bold enough to play this rough sport. We had control of the playing field during the evenings and an unspoken supremacy of the pool. We were the uncrowned kings and could do whatever we wanted. Ofcourse I had just started, but thats the treatment the waterpolo team would get. Slowly my laziness and long arms and legs transformed me in to the goal-keeper of the team. I was practicing day in day out. Every evening I would be present at the pool to practice and play. The next summer, I remember one of the coaches took a camp to teach all the new kids what waterpolo was all about. All of us who took part in that camp excelled. We were proud of ourselves for having completed the camp. To this day, that coach is revered for his skill in building our team. Slowly but surely I made a mark in the sport. First at the club level, then state level and finally I won Gold medals for my home state and my university at the national level.  &nbsp;  Those were the days. I loved playing so much that nothing would stop me from showing up for practice. Not my girlfriend, not studies, not family gatherings. My first priority would be to go play waterpolo and then everything else.&nbsp;I loved how the team was bound together. Those evening shootouts, the practice game, the morning practice, the heavy breakfast after practice, the trips we made to places I'd never have gone otherwise, it was all really awesome. Winning made it all even better. We played some of our best waterpolo in those 4 years. I was studying engineering then. During the last two years of engineering, I couldn't compete as much as I had earlier. Reality caught up and better studies/grades were required of me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Today its been almost 4 yrs since I stopped playing. I have missed it all the time. Seeing the Olympic qualification trials here and swimming today brought back very fond memories. It is disappointing that I could swim only 500 mts today, but then thats the maximum I've done in the past so many years.&nbsp; Being a goal-keeper, I never had to swim much.&nbsp; Oh ! how much I would enjoy going back once and playing with all the old teammates.

      As you might have noticed, I have started giving titles to my posts. I have not yet paid attention to how they look in the blog. I'm guessing they look in sync with the stylesheet of the blog. The main thing behind this decision to start giving titles is the neatness I seek in the Previous Posts column. I hope this achieves it.   You may have also noticed the new blogger, if you&nbsp;use it. Its a new post editor and they've done a really wonderful job. I think I like it though I've gotten used to the earlier version. Progress is good most of the times, right ?&nbsp;

      There's so much news out there to be followed. Above and beyond your normal sources of news. I personally have quite a considerable list of favorites on my IE and going through all of them everyday is impossible along with all the other things I do when I'm online. Check mail, chat with friends and family, look for jobs and after all this I go through my collection of photography sites and blogs and food sites and news sites. There are days when I'm not able to do any of this because of some prior engagements or some other preoccupation. My point is, even through everything I'm doing in the day, the only sites I am sure to visit everyday for sure are the mail sites [hotmail,yahoo,gmail] and maybe google search.  I've been following my site stats for this blog for sometime now and I see that I have a couple of loyal readers. They are here at least once everyday. They keep in touch and they read the archives if they happen to miss a day or two. I admire you guys for such regularity. Its a mystery to me how you find my writing enjoyable and you like to follow my blog. The writer inside me also feels praised and appreciated when I see your visits being logged day in day out. Though this blog is just a personal expressin, having you visit and read through is nice and appreciated.  On a sad sad note: At least 75 kids were killed in a fire in India. Its all over the news. There were no fire extinguishers in the school and the fire started because of a short circuit in the kitchen with a thatched roof. The poverty and lack of resources in my homeland is just too sad. I'm sure, given similar conditions to those prevalent in the US or Europe, India would be a much better a greater world power. I'm also hopeful of the path we've taken to get there, coz one day we'll get there for sure.

        Have you seen the woman's 9-ball pool tournament they are showing on ESPN right now ? The ladies have their seperate league and tournaments ! My question is - are the ladies really different from men at playing pool ? Maybe we should have just a single universal league here ! Some other similar games would be card games [poker, blackjack] and chess. I mean in pool you don't really need power where presumably men would have advantage. I think its just conventional to have seperate games for women where they are probably just as good [or even better] as their male counterparts.    I was also watching the "Outdoor Games" on ESPN a while ago - specifically the dog agility trials. When these dogs and their handlers finish the course they are so happy to have done it, whichever way they finished. The dog is jumping up and down, responding to the delight shown by the owner and all in all its a very pleasant sight. Reminded me of my own dog and how we used to play around at times. I most certainly hope to have another dog one day, but there will always be only one "Blacky".

      Do you know the difference between a  sunroof  and a  moonroof  in cars? I had just some clue till now and it proved out to be true. There have been long discussions and the opinion seems to be that moonroofs are transperent [read glass] while sunroofs are metal. Both are openings in the roof.   urlLink http://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20030617.html    urlLink http://forums.maxima.org/archive/index.php/t-320564

      Have you seen the ad where Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf's son [the ad shows it that way] is playing this pro and basically kicking ass ? hehe .. the punch line goes something like "Genes make all the difference". Its one of the cutest ads on tv right now, always gets me to smile. Imagine what kind of a superb tennis player their real kid could be once he grows up :). They have a daughter too. So it could just be that the tennis couple's son and daughter could be atop the tennis rankings in like another 15-20 years. You never know right!  Onto food ... I had one of the best mornings in recent weeks with reference to breakfast. It was the simple donut and coffee thing. The difference was the coffee was really good. It was slightly bitter and I managed to put in the right amount of sugar for once. The donut was chocolate frosted and was really sweet, so went well with the coffee. After a not so successful attempt at cooking salmon [I overcooked it], this was a welcome break. I wish I could develop a really good coffee recipe and follow it everytime to get a cup like this morning. I hope I can do it. I think there's been a previous entry to similar effect.

      I was just imagining how easy it is to find your way around in the US. All you need is the correct street number of the place, the street name and you can find your way. There are websites like Yahoo! Maps and Mapquest and many more that will easily plot out a road map for you to get to the specified place. Try that in India.   Any Indian can tell you this. It is almost impossible to have a service like that in even the most modern of Indian cities unless we are talking about Chandigarh or Gandhinagar [the planned cities]. The thing is none of the cities in India are planned. They just grow as the need be and proper roads are an afterthought. If you need to find an address in a given Indian city, you are much better off having someone local with you or getting into some form of local cab.   When you are to find an address in India, you could easily get directions that go something like this -   Follow this road down to the police station, take a right at the next signal, into the no-entry, avoid the traffic police, slide behind the fruit cart at the corner of the grocery shop, take a left, turn around the tree smack in the middle of the road, pray to the God at the temple on your left, turn around and ask the 'panwallah' [Americans can't even start to understand what this person does for a living!] for the next step.  Haha ... I won't blame you if all this confuses you no end. Its normal for people to feel confused trying to find an address. Its not all that bad though. Generally if you've lived in a city for more than 10 years, you've been through most of its bylanes and major communities. I'm just contrasting what we have here in USA and how things work in India. To tell you the truth, the Indian system, though backward, has its own little fun. You don't have to remember most roads by names and most residential buildings and communities aren't known by numbers. There's no necessity of knowing which direction is north to reach your destination. It is all so different.  Anyways .. I found some really cool links. Most of it seems to be true though you'll have your own opinions. Do check it out.   urlLink How to tell if you're American  and  urlLink How to tell if you're Indian

      251st entry! I don't know what I'm so happy about, haha, its just like any other entry. Milestones don't impress me as much I guess. Or maybe they do and I'm just in denial or something. What am I talking about?  Anyways .. Does anyone out there think  urlLink Eric McCormack  [Will from  Will and Grace ] and  urlLink Adrian Paul  [Duncan MacLeod from  Highlander ] look like long lost brothers? I think so. I happened to catch some episode of the Highlander, the very old series, where Adrian Paul played this Immortal! Did anyone else like this series? I mean I liked it against all odds. I don't know the reason I liked it, maybe it was the swords or the realistic duels. The series got monotonous, you knew what was to happen. I mean how many fights could you watch where you knew Duncan was to win anyways. But I liked it all the same. That is the reason I watched it again this morning.  Maybe I'm addicted to TV or something. Hope not.

      I was wondering, about Tibetan monastaries. Suppose I were to reach some really remote monastery in and around those mountain areas. I'm in really good shape and I'm there particularly to join them for life. I want to learn what their religion is all about and live there in peace doing whats necessary. In short - become a monk. Would they take me? What are the criteria for such an entry? Forget Tibetan monasteries, would it be possible to leave everything and become a monk in some Christian monastery in the European Alps or maybe some "ashram" back in India? What are the criteria for one to become a monk?  There are several monastery websites that advertise all kinds of learning courses from a week, a month to six months to a year long. They ask for money ofcourse and it seems interesting. I wouldn't mind doing it, why not get some perspective in life.  [Edit]: It might seem that I'm being ostentatious about this, but I don't mean to.

      If you know about water polo ... great. You know what a tough sport it is. I played water polo for long and cannot understand why the Americans don't love it as much or for that matter why it isn't such a popular sport in the world. I guess its because not as many people are comfortable with swimming.   If you don't know the first thing about water polo, I would suggest visiting  urlLink FINA's water polo website  for rules and regulations. If it gets boring, find a place nearby to watch a game or two live. You'll know what I'm talking about. Water polo is a very thrilling and exciting game. It is a true spectator sport where the viewer is never bored. You should also check out what  urlLink Eric Neel  of  urlLink ESPN  has to say about  urlLink his experience of the game .

       urlLink PhotoFriday  is just getting out of hand. Boy o boy! they have 400+ people posting their shots every week now. I think this week was an especially common subject that every photographer has to have a shot of - Clouds. The photo list shot up to 600+ this week and if the themes remain as simplistic, more and more people will find out about it soon enough.   All this is great as everyone including me enjoys all the posted entries. There's only an upside to it from whatever viewpoint you see. The only thing that bothers me is as a viewer and occasional voter for my fav. entries, I will now have to go through 600 entries in a week! I tend to view all the links at once, that is after the deadline. This way I know which ones create more of an impact and which ones I really like and so on till I've voted for my top 6. It gets just more and more difficult to judge now. There's no doubt this community will increase rapidly and soon we'll have a 1000+ fotos every week. Wouldn't that be awesome!   I'm getting ideas now about how to make it more interesting. Maybe I should email the guys at Photofriday.com and let them know of some.

      I've been reading  urlLink Bill Bryson's "I'm a Stranger Here Myself" . This book is a collection of 70 essays Mr. Bryson wrote for the readers of some British newspaper's Sunday edition. Most [read 90%] of the essays in the book are complaints about how Americans are different and how it is very amusing indeed to him as an original American who has stayed away in Britain for 20 years. If you are not an American or have not stayed here all that long, you will definately identify with certain quirks that the author describes. Its a very interesting book indeed and I've loved everything in there.  Its quite eye-opening too if you read between the lines. The most subtle remarks the author makes about Americans in general are very valid points indeed. I just found out a whole bunch of his other works at the public library and will make it a point to read through some of them.  [Edit]: One article titled - "Life's Mysteries" is really nice. I will type it in if I find the time. If not all, atleast some of the lines which are highly amusing.

      Oh My God! How much more can they [Sports Media] chew on the "Coach K to LA" story? I mean the man says he'll decide by Monday so let it be unless there's some new development. These guys are going at it like there's no other news in the world.   Missed out on the Schumi win at Magny-Cours early this morning. I slept late and as a consequence didn't even open eyes until 9:45am. It was good though unlike nite before last when i slept in spurts of 2 hours ... got up at 1, 3, 5, 7 and then finally 9am that morning. That was horrible. So anyways - it seems Schumi just decimated the Renault challenge with some really superb driving and a really clever strategy to his backing. I HAVE to catch the replay tonite.

      Oh yes, before I forget [which by tommorrow morning I most certainly would have!], I had a really nice new ice-cream tonite. Its the "Banana Split" from  urlLink Blue Bell Creameries  made right here in Texas :). Sweet ... just read the ingredients of the ice cream and I'm sure your mouth will water ... hehe.  "Banana Split - Combines fresh sliced bananas, crushed pineapple, diced maraschino cherries and chopped, roasted almonds into a rich vanilla ice cream with strawberry sauce and chocolate sundae sauce." - as taken from  bluebell.com

      I have times when I prefer not to speak. The frequency I'd say is around once every 8-10 weeks. I just don't feel like speaking, contributing to a conversation. Every conversation that's going on around me seems the most trivial and avoidable. At these times I can go without moving my lips for as many as 24 hours without saying a word. I tend to think of it as cleansing, whatever it is it makes me feel different at the end of it. Its quite natural too, I don't force it on myself. Its like a bout that strikes every once in a while.  Have u seen the moon these past 2-3 days? Its been at its fullest and rises pretty late. It appears larger when it rises. This time its given me the feel of being very artificial. For some reason, it looks like those fake moons they made up in studios for "moonlit" scenes in old movies. I don't know if it's just me or what.

      I got up pretty early today because of which sleep in the late afternoon/ early evening was almost unavoidable. I had just started reading a book in bed and in 5 min I was sleeping. I had to force myself to get up after an hour and a half otherwise I could've just continued sleeping through the evening.  Incidentally, I got up early [6:30] to go drop off a friend at the aiport. It was a pleasant drive, I wish I was driving :). I always wish I'm driving, unless the vehicle isn't in good condition where the rightful owner/daily user can have it. Otherwise I love to drive. And oh ... I do ask for directions if I get lost, only I don't get lost.  Free food beckons in some time so I must leave in a few mins.

      There's so many things I actually long to do. I just don't have the courage/confidence to go ahead and do it. This lack of confidence comes from the fact that I have some basic social responsibilities to take care of. I'm expected to find a good job and stable living. I'm expected to earn money enough to give myself some standing in society. I personally expect myself to have enough money to live a decent life.  I know, all this is what normal guys do. I don't disagree with the importance of these things. My main aim though, is to find happiness in life through some other means. I want to be able to cook - that makes me happy. I want to be able to buy good [read expensive] photography equipment by myself and use it for some pleasing shots. I want to be able to travel the world and see all the beautiful places out there.   In short, I want to do things that please me, but don't pay me. I don't want to be super good at any of these, though if an opportunity to do that presented itself, I would jump on it with my eyes closed. Can I go to cooking school somewhere at this age? Can I go learn photography somewhere? Ofcourse I can. Should I? Thats where the debate starts.   My morality says I have spent enough of my parents money on education [I am an Electrical Engineer] to leave it all behind and go into something new. It says I should look for a job right now and find a source of income to complement my parents. I feel a guilt of sorts that I will have spent all my parents money and not achieved anything substantial [in terms of money]. I am going to give this a serious thought. I don't know what I will do, but  think  I will.

      I got a new book from the library today. Its a book of short Short Stories. That's supposed to be some kind of sub-category of a literary genre. Its very very short stories that don't need much time to be invested. I could read one in say 5 min. That way, I figure, I will have the next 5 min. to think about what I just read, and then I can go on to the next story.  I also got the book thinking it might help me think of stuff to write here. You know, there's so much happening, even in this mundane life of mine that could be worth something if I put it here. I never remember everything that happens during the day and for all I've tried, I've not been able to get myself to write things down. Lets see how this book works out. If not anything else, I hope it proves a good read.

      I just wrote down a long post about how I loved Mozilla Firefox and then about the movies I watched over the weekend. Now in all my innocence, I closed the tabbed Firefox  parent window, closing in effect all the windows inside :(. Damn me and my stupidity. Well ... I'm not going to write everything again. I'll be a lot concise this time.  I saw "The Village" and "Gayab".   The Village - awesome, beautiful. Gayab - ok, made me laugh at times.  In general, I was thinking about what kind of movies I like. I think I like movies with a fixating story line and stunning visuals. The movie presentation has to be the best and its story cannot be cliched. Give me those two things and chances are pretty good that I'll like the movie. Give me something new.
