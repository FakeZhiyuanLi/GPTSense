      Well, you’re either here because you know me or because of a search engine mishap. I signed on here in the hopes that I could maintain some sort of web journal, since that’s what the kids are doing these days. That, and it makes me feel important, a side-effect of living in a media-saturated post-modern society. You’re not really somebody unless other people pay attention to you. I’m going to try to keep it updated regularly, but don’t hold me to that.   I’m basically going to use this page to rant or rave about various topics, though I think there will be a focus on five main interests: my wife Shannon, who is also my best friend and easily the most interesting person in the world (you should probably be reading her page instead of this); my daughter Emily, who turned three months old last week; movies, a topic I occasionally claim to know something about; music, something I couldn’t imagine living without; and video games, which essentially suck up my free time like some sort of all-consuming rift in the fabric of space and time.   I discovered this site through Bill Harris, a talented and eloquent writer who maintains his own site over   urlLink here . He was a long-time contributer to Gone Gold, where his thrice-weekly column was the main draw to that site for me. Anyway, I highly recommend that you check it out.   So, as I said earlier, Emily turned three months old last week. I don’t know how that happened so fast. She’s doing really well, though. At least, I assume she is, having never done this before. It’s so funny how something will strike her as absolutely hilarious, and then 30 seconds later will have her tearing up. I’m starting to think that she knows how her tears and pouting face can pretty much bring me to my knees. Shannon says she’s got me wrapped around her little finger, and she’s pretty much on the money. This could be bad in later years, but I don’t know what to do. She’s just so adorable.   As I was driving to work today, I was listening to Ben Folds’ solo album – Rockin’ the Suburbs. I haven’t listened to it in a while and I realized today, again, that it’s a damn fine record. Obviously, his piano is up to snuff, but the lyrics are so well-written; the songs run the gamut from hilarious to heart-rending. The last track, “The Luckiest,” may well be the best love song ever written…well maybe not, but it’s up there. I guess I must have been feeling sentimental today, because the part about the 90-year-old man dying and then being followed by his wife two days later brought tears to my eyes. I’m not ashamed to admit it. Ok, maybe a little ashamed.
