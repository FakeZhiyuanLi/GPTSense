       Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their "tact". Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    "We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap." ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  "The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair." Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the "meager handouts" to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those "meager" handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular "welfare system". My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string.  Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be "We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it." If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. "Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions." Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  "Addicts out of control were a tiny minority." Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.
