      June 28th, 2004, my first meeting. I actually weighed a little less than I thought. My bathroom scale said 270. OK, 2 pounds, not much in the grand scheme of things, but I'll take all I can get. I've actually lost a few pounds on my own, I was 285 about five months ago. But I can't do it myself, I don't do well without some structure. I'd love to say I'm completely self guided, but I don't want to delude myself. I'm happiest when I've got a plan.  When you join WW, you don't get a target weight right away. Your first goal is to loose 10% of your current weight. For me that means 26 pounds. 10% seems like so little, but it also means 242! Put in that perspective, it seems like a LOT.  The meeting itself wasn't much to speak of. Since I've done it before I understood how to use all the tools, how to calculate points, etc. The leader this week was not the regular, she's on holiday. Though this leader was nice enough, she reminds me a bit too much of one of my aunts, and I'm kind of glad she's not going to be our regular leader. She's a bit on the fake side, and her leathery tanned skin freaks me out.

      I'm starting this blog a week late, only because just this evening I just though of documenting my weight loss. Last week, June 28th my wife and I joined weight watchers for the second time. We joined a few years ago when we lived in Washington State and we both lost quite a bit, myself a bit more than 60 pounds. However, life caught up with us, we moved to Boston, left "The Program" (Weight Watchers speak), had a baby and I managed to gain back all that I lost.  Now, we're back on the west coast, and we have a beautiful little 14 month old girl. I want this little girl to know her father when he's 60, 70, 80..... and I know that if I don't change my life a lot, she's not going to. I start this diet with 60 pounds to loose, going from 270 to 210. I haven't weight 210 since I was, hmmm, 25? Maybe less? I think 210 is a good weight for me. I'm 6'5" and I've got a fairly thick frame. Any less I think I'd be doing a Kate Moss impression.  I know the extra weight is killing me. I can feel it. I loose my breath climbing a flight of stairs. Running around the back yard with my daughter never lasts more than a minute or two before I'm too winded to go on. I had a blood test to get life insurance and my rates were higher due to my cholesterol. My knees hurt, I don't fit in a chair properly, my gut hits my desk, and I hate looking at my body in a mirror. I'm ready for a change, I'm doing it for me, my wife and my little girl.  I know Weight Watchers (I'll be lazy and type WW from here on in) works, and I know for me, it's the right way to loose weight. Some people may disagree or pooh-pooh it, but WW makes sense. You get tools to help you easily measure what you eat, keep track of it and get support and motivation. In some ways it's very basic. Eat less and exercise, the time honored and sensible way to cut the flab. Easy to say, but not easy to practice. WW gives me the structure I need, motivation (not the least of which is the weekly weigh in) and a sympathetic shoulder when I have a bad week. And no, they don't pay me :)  In fact, what I learned from the last time I did the program was how to cope with your desire to eat. One of the things they recommend is keeping busy. You can't eat if you're using your hands for something else. Hence the blog. Some rationale:  - A positive outlet for my emotions while I struggle with my weight and cravings. - Keep motivated via the prospect of extremely public humiliation. - Once I've lost the weight, having something to remind me of why I want to keep it off, for good this time. - Blogs are cool. - Maybe motivate someone like myself to loose some weight too.  Here's what you can expect if you read this blog on a regular basis. Please hold me to this! I tend to not follow through on things unless kept in check by some external force. Give me crap if I don't do these things!  - Post every time I weigh in, what my new weight is. - Post a picture of myself each week so I can see the change. - Post when I'm up or down, no matter what!  Thanks for reading.

      Again, the late post. You know, having a toddler makes you realize that you operate on their time, not yours! Emily was ill last night with (we think) the stomach flu, so we were up with her most of the night. Poor thing didn't know what was going on. It's the first time since she was a baby, still being breast fed, that she'd thrown up. And she couldn't stop, I think she vomited 4 or 5 times, about 1/2 hour apart. She's better this morning, and starving, but still obviously not feeling well.  As for me, another successful week. -2.4 lbs. I did a much better job of staying on program, and used my activity points wisely. I havent' started DDR yet, I really need to get in to gear with that, but I've tried to keep up my daily afternoon walks. I don't predict any challenges this week since we're home and Maegan's been doing a lot of cooking (thanks sweetheart!) I'll try to post new pics soon.

      -2.2 lbs this week. I was a little concerned I wouldn't loose, as my wife and daughter were away, and I didn't do a great job of journaling my food intake (this is a pretty vital tool for me to stay on track), and I ate out a lot, but I did try to do some good walking, so I think that helped make up for it. I know I went over my 30 points each day, but I think I barely stayed within my flex points, or just a bit over. I didn't "deserve" to loose the weight I suppose, but I think my body is in "loss mode" which happened last time I did WW as well. Once I hit 10% the loss slowed down a lot, and I'm expecting that to happen again.    Good things I did this week:       Even though I ate out, I made good choices. Subway has really good salads now, and they're a good way to shave a few points over having a sandwich.     Walked every day during my afternoon breaks. That makes 15 minutes walking, plus 2 * 10 getting to and from work, so 35 minutes of brisk walking a day as part of my routine.    Last week introduced activity points. Bascially there is a formula that determines how many points you can "get back" by excersizing. This is really a motivating tool for me, since it means I can eat a bit more on occasion. I don't like to abuse it, but it is nice to have some flexibility, especially when I hit 249 lbs and I have to take 2 points a day off my allowed amount.  Since the higher impact the workout, the more activity points you can get, I'm going to start doing Dance Dance Revolution again. What a great thing, I can burn calories and play a video game at the same time! It's not a joke either, and  urlLink I'm not the only one who's found the benefits of playing this game .    Note: My wife suggested that I only do my pictures once a month, so that you can notice some change. So, once a month it is! Though I don't think there's much visible change, I've noticed some clothes fitting looser. I have a pair of shorts with a build in belt I haven't been able to close for a while. It closes now, whoopee!

      My wife took my weigh in information with her, so I don't have the exact amount. I believe it was -2.8, but I won't be able to update accurately until then.  I had a decent week. We had one night which was our first "date" night since Emily was born. It was very nice, but we splurged and went out to a very fancy dinner. We had a cocktail, appetizer and desert, wow! Actually, I would have stayed in my points (after eliminating ALL my flex points! :) except we went to Starbucks later in the evening and I got a strawberry cream Frappucinno (sp?) Little did I know those suckers are  11 points ! Holy cow, it's iced tea from now on (can't stand coffee.) Most of my meals are fewer points than that. However, since I was very agressive with the plan the rest of the week, I still had a good loss.  This week has been a bit more of a struggle. With Maegan and Emily out of town, I'm on my own, and I'm not being very structured. We don't have a lot of "easy" food in the house and after a day of working I hate to cook, as I'm usually starving. So I'm about 12 points in to my flex points already and it's only Thursday. I'm going to try to straighten it out today, but I'm a little worried about the weekend. I'm going to join everyone at my wife's parents, and they tend to cook very good, but not so WW friendly food, as well as eat out a lot. I know it's up to me to control the portions and make healthy choices, but I often find it difficult when I get in this situation to do that. It's a mental thing I need to overcome. We'll see what the scale says on Monday.

      Went to the meeting last night and I had a good loss. However, my wife and daughter were travelling to her parents today, so we spent time in the evening together. When I get home and have the exact numbers I'll post them here.

      Wow, these are about as unflattering as they come. Here's how I look this week...       I didn't realize I had such the double chin going on. Yeesh.

      Wooohoooo! What a freaking fantastic start! OK, they warn you, the first week or two you're loosing water, whatever that means, which water am I loosing? You tend to loose more in the first two weeks than in the remaining. This is a good thing. I don't think loosing 5 pounds a week would be very healthy, and I mean the renal failure type of unhealthy. But it's dang motivating nonetheless.  Here's what went right this week: - My wife is going to do the  urlLink Weekend to End Breast Cancer  walk in Vancouver at the end of august so she's been doing training walk. She had a 24k scheduled for Canada Day, so I joined in. Though sore, it felt good, and I'm sure a 3 1/2 hour walk has to burn a calorie or two! - I was vigilant about my food journal. Keeping track of what I eat really shows me what I did and didn't need. - I usually drink a good deal of water, but I drank twice what I usually do. Probably 64-80 fl. oz. a day.  What went wrong: Canada day/4th of July means visitors and barbecues. We had one with a friend on Friday, and I'd planned for it. I knew I'd go a bit over my target for the day, but since we were buying the food we could control it as well. We didn't want to serve "diet" food to our friend, but we didn't need to go crazy either. So that was fine. However, we had another friend visit the next day, and originally we though we'd go out for dinner. However, friend set #3 invited us all over for yet another BBQ. Oh oh, these two friends aren't exactly svelte. And, to top it off, due to a large breakfast, I'd skipped lunch, and dinner was late. So, ugh, I gorged on their appetizers. Chips, dips, cheese, crackers. I couldn't even keep track. Well, so my journaling was vigilant EXCEPT for Saturday evening.  I was really worried that my food orgy would blow the week and I wouldn't post a loss. Well, I didn't need to worry obviously. I think I was good enough for the rest of the week that I still lost that mysterious water. Next week we don't have any functions planed other than a private dinner and movie, so I can order something sensible and skip the buttered popcorn.  I promise to post some pictures soon. It's too late to do it now, I'd wake up our visitors since the computer is next to their room and it's way past my bedtime!

      Monday was a holiday in Canada (BC day here) so there was no weigh in. I think that's a good thing because I didn't have a great week. I don't really know why, I just blew it over the course of several days. This week I'm back on track, and I'm hoping this coming Monday shows a loss.  It's time for monthly pictures! The exciting thing about these pictures is that those jeans I'm wearing haven't fit for a year. So something's actually happening!
