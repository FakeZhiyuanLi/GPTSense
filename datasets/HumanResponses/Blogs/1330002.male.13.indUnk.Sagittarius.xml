      This is a photoblog (sometimes called a 'photolog'). A photoblog is an easy way to share pictures, with comments and such, on the internet. Most of the pictures on this blog are ones that I have taken or made, though some aren't. For camera I use a less-than-great Kodak CX4230 (2 megapixels). I'm hoping to get a much better camera as soon as possible.  Some hints/tips for my photoblog: - You can click photos for larger versions - Click the 'Comments' link at the end of each post to view and/or post comments. Feel free to post... - As the blog gets bigger, older posts are be archived. You can access them by click on a link in the archives. The blog is archived once a week.  Guide to categories: (effected) - Means that the photo has been drastically changed from it's original by means of effects in Adobe Photoshop. Though I do make changes to lighting and color, they are only to make the original photo look better, not to make it look different. (not by me) - Pretty obvious. For photos not by me.  If I have posted a picture that has you in it and you object to this, simply email me at  TristanG@Gmail.com  and I will remove or edit the picture.  Also, I am accepting donations. ANY donation that you make would be greatly appreciated. 5 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, more? It all is appreciated. Donations go toward a much better digital camera, so donations help toward making this website's content even better! If you enjoy this website, please consider making a donation! Just click this button:        ">    Enjoy and check back frequently! -Tristan

      Below are a bunch of photos from my family's trip to Bermuda. We went from the 19th to the 25th of June. The pictures are in reverse chronological order, so scroll down to the picture from the airport to start from the beginning. Since I didn't want to overwelm you all with pictures, I only chose a few. In total we got about 75 pictures from the trip. Enjoy!  -Tristan

       urlLink    I don't know if any of you are wondering about the lack of updates lately, but I've come with an explanation anyway. This week I'm taking a photography class, using good ol' black and white film in a good ol' Canon SLR. The class teaches camera functions, composition, and developing of film. It's been great. I've enjoyed using the film camera and can't wait to print my two rolls of film. I've already developed the film and made negatives, but am going to print them tomorrow. Maybe once school starts I'll scan a couple of them if they turn out well (I don't have a scanner of my own). Once I finish this class, I hope to start up on digital again. Though, I don't know if I'll be able to bare using this Kodak point and shoot again...it seemed a big pain taking these pictures. Maybe this will be what gets me to buy a new digital camera. Who knows, maybe I'll buy a film SLR and a scanner...who knows....

It shows it being supported by a small, twisty-tied  tube. The second, a small vine of some sort growing up, twisting and bending, without any support at all.

      Well, I'm back at it! To make up a bit for all the days I missed, I decided to post  three  pictures today. I hope you enjoy them.   A note about the photography class :  I thoroughly enjoy it. I was pleased with most of the prints I made and I learned a lot. I was correct in predicting that going back to the Kodak point-and-shoot camera would be painful. There were pictures I really wanted to take, but just couldn't because of limitations of the camera. I hope that soon I'll have a digital camera with which I can take all the pictures that I would like to.  [Shameful begging starts now] If you would like to help me get a camera with which I can take pictures with real creativity, a donation would be  wonderful . From one dollar to  five hundred, they all would be greatly accepted. If you would like to donate, click the donate button on the right column below the copyright text. [/Shameful begging]  Anyway, it's changed my view of photography. I enjoyed doing black and white and I think I might start doing more black and white or de-saturated photos. We'll see. I hope you enjoy these three pictures.  -Tristan
