      Good Afternoon!  I got to sleep in this morning. It felt good. I prayed at some point last night. I don't think it was before I went to sleep and it wasn't quite when I woke up. It  must have been at some point in the middle of the night during one of my fitful bouts of sleep/sleeplessness. Anyway ... I prayed for God to take away the darkness from within me. Get the Devil the heck out of my thoughts. He's there ... always challenging me and my thoughts on God and Jesus. He's there always tempting me with things I know I should not think, do, say, etc. Just get him out! I want to commit my life FULLY to God ... FULLY to the good ... FULLY to the light.  I do long for the day Jesus comes to defeat the evil on this world. It just seems to get worse and worse. I pray for my children that things don't continue to get scarier out there for them. What kind of world will be waiting for them when they grow up? It's such a scary thought.  I pray for my children to have a strong relationship with Jesus. They cannot depend on my salvation for their own. I love them dearly. I want to see them in eternity.  I can't wait for the day I can sing praises to God for eternity. Isn't that such an awesome thought? No more darkness. No more tears!!!!   To look over my words here, I think that I might look like a fanatic. But you know what? That's okay! God needs more fanatics out there to share His light and His love.  Prayer topic for today: The church is doing an outreach at the fireworks display tonight, handing out cold bottles of water. I pray first of all that it doesn't rain out the fireworks display! Second of all that the community will receive God's love through the volunteers who are handing out the water. I pray that it will bring some closer to God who might be seeking Him and not even know it.  Lord, be with me as I go through my day today. Help me to make the right choices, say the right things at the right times. Help me with the temptations that I always struggle with. They didn't seem quite so strong this mornign after my prayer last night. Thank you for battling that evil for me. I want to be strong and to play my part in the battle. Thank you for giving my life a purpose.  With all my heart in Jesus' name,  Amen

      Day 2 begins ...  I woke up this morning with a man on television telling me why it's a sin to not worship God on Sunday. But  really , doesn't God want us to worship Him every day, not just Sunday?  CeCe Winins keeps singing through my head ... "Let everything that has breath praise God!" I want to keep the spirit of praise alive all day long. I tried yesterday. It was hard at points. I got to work after a week's vacation and BAM! It was like I never left. I was exasperated as soon as I walked through the door. Bombarded with deadlines and goals to meet. Sometimes I think I need more than a vacation ... I need a re-dedication to what I want to do with the rest of my life.   Forgiveness ... I need forgiveness. We all do. Speaking of work - another bad habit fell right back into place as well - gossip. I hate gossip. It's so easy to fall into its clutches. Someone starts gossiping and my ears immediately perk up. Tell me! I don't want to miss out! Is gossip so interesting because at least they're not talking about you at the time? You know that as soon as your back is turned, it's your turn. I hope not ... I like to think not, but you know it happens everywhere. It's such an evil thing. I need to read James. I need to pray for forgiveness and strength to avoid gossip.  I also need strength to stick with my new diet and exercise plan. It's not much of a diet and exercise plan if I don't follow them. I didn't follow it at all yesterday. One step at a time. It was stressful enough just going back to work. I will try harder today, and pray for the strength to avoid the junk food and the encouragement to go to the gym even if I had a hard day at work. I NEED to do it. My body is a temple. You couldn't tell by looking at it!  Am I trying to take on too many changes at once? I hope not.  Prayer Adventure time ... Prayer topic for today is: Volunteers in the Vacation Bible School. They are such wonderful people! God, please bless them and the work they are doing with the kids ... with my kids as well!! They love going and are being drawn closer to You in the process. It takes a special person to have the strength and courage and tenderness to volunteer to work with tons of kids like that. To give up their free time in the evenings. All to show God's love to the children. Bless them and their work, Lord.  Amen

      I always start out strong. I have the best intentions to start journaling and I end up losing the journal. None of them are actually lost. They're all buried under books that I've started reading and never finished. I would find them if I actually looked. But then I'd have all that blank time between the last entry and now. I thought maybe journaling online might make it easier. I always seem to be at the computer for one reason or another - to check email, look into something I'm curious about (lately it's been African Daisies). So here I am. This is where I will bring my thoughts. This is not your ordinary journal. This is my Heart and Soul Makeover journal. I'm trying to better my heart through exercise and diet and I'm trying to better my soul through prayer, journaling and reading the Bible. This is Day One. It's always easy to get started. It's once you're a few days into it when things start going willy-nilly. I plan to journal out my thoughts every day and then spend some time reading the Bible, and in prayer. Oh yeah ... I forgot to mention that I willfully got up at 5 a.m. this morning to begin this quest. Because I have no other time throughout the day to accomplish this ... and it's something that I really WANT to do. I don't NEED to do it ... well I do ... but I WANT to spend this time to sort out my thoughts and get closer to God.  So with that little intro ... here's what's been on my mind:  I thought I was over the thing about the guy taking the money out of our checking account. I really thought I had turned it all over to God. I truly am thankful that he only took what extra I had saved up and didn't touch any that we NEEDED to live off of. But it's just so stinking unfair that he can get away with it. God, I want justice to be served on him. Why isn't justice swift and immeidate? That would stop so much evil that's out there. I know justice will be served in your time. I know Jesus died on the cross for all of our sins. Maybe someday before he dies, he will find your WAY and repent for his wrong-doing(s). I need to pray for this man. I also need to pray for my feelings of anger towards him and what he has done. I spent much of yesterday just thinking about it and even crying a little. I was misdirecting my frustration on myself and on Clark. Please help me to not do that God. Help me to just turn it all over to you and to let you deal with it. I need to hold out HOPE in this dark world.  God, help me to be a light, shining your love onto this world. It so needs MORE of your LOVE. I don't feel right when I'm carrying anger, hurt, worry and all those dark feelings around with me. Help me to shed them and shine your LOVE.  Today we start our Prayer Adventure at church. Today I am to pray for the Jr. High ministry team as they guide our early teens into a closer love and relationship with God. I pray that they are able to show these teens their excitement for God's love. What a difference it can make in a life - and to imagine it making that kind of difference in a young person's life!! To see our teens want to serve God and spread His love. God I pray that the Jr. High ministry team is blessed through Jesus' name.  Finally, help me to keep you in mind as I go through my day today, Lord. I want to lift you up in Praise. Above all else. You come first!!!  Amen
