      Ahhhh fleet week in New York City. All those neatly pressed white uniforms. The presence of America’s fighting men and women brings back memories of my  urlLink gay-cation   (Don't ask) with rob last year. (Seamen's Bank...the irony) We were hanging out on the porch of the little inn we were staying at, watching the bears stroll by to the convention. (Don't ask) Just then a sassy lil fella wearing a sailor hat storms up in his rusty 1979 Monte Carlo. He slams the car in park (leaving the car running, I mean who would want to steal it) and proceeds to sashay into the BBQ take-out joint. Just then we hear someone yell in the queeniest of voices: "Heeey it's a sailor".   Those were good times!

      Guest blogging now and every Thursday is the fashionable girl with the world’s shortest attention span -  KATE ALLEN !  Kate's first entry:  So apparently, the new trend in pornography is crotch shots on escalators with digital cameras and camera phones.  I was watching the NYC local news the other night and out on Long Island, 31 year-old  urlLink Scott Lyons was arrested for such an act .     Wondering if this was really a trend, a conducted a google search which provided me with a few news links to similar occurrences around the country, and a conducted a phone poll of my friends across the country and many shared similar stories they’d seen in their local news.  But back to the NYC local news….the most entertaining part of the segment wasn’t that this guy was taking crotch shots, but that apparently the police were asking that the victims, these women, to please come forward.   And what, identify their crotch?    Victim:  "I was in the mall the other day and I saw this flash.  I think you might have a picture of my "present"  The office:  "Would you mind taking a look at the evidence, to determine which one, if any, you are?"  Victim:  “Yes officer, that picture is me, I’m very bushy”    The officer, having been looking at them for hours with his fellow officers and never would have picked her for that shot replies: “Are you sure? You’re not a real blond?”    So, Mr. Lyons was charged with unlawful surveillance-- a victimless crime. Participants in a victimless crime will not report it to authorities because they’re unaware it even happened- as is the case with the Long Island crotchographer.  But if you're unaware that it happened, should you even care if you get snapped?  I mean, most likely Mr. Lyons, though obviously not the smartest man, isn’t taking pictures of fat girls...we all know it’d take more than a flash to navigate between two eighty pound thighs.    So should we feel sorta happy if we get snapped—it means your hot, right?

      Two quick points for today:  Summer has arrived in NYC! You want proof? Here ya go:  Crazy people are back in effect. I have seen SO many crazies in the past few weeks. I think it's the heat that encourages them to get out and "discover" NYC. Today as I unwillingly return from my lunch, (which sucked) I over heard a much deschelved black man having this conversation on his cell phone (while similatiously drooling): "Fuckin Bloomberg. The Jew-black relations in this city suck. The Irish be sellin drugs all over west fourth street. The fuckin Irish." I thought I had stumbled into the five-points and Leonardo was about to slice me up.   Blogging...some thoughts on the subject:  The NYT says that  urlLink blogging  is the new black. The rule is: if it's in the NYT it's over. That's it...We're disbanding. The good news is we won't be missed by many, as no one reads this (which is what they say in the article...98% of blogs aren't read. Yadda yadda yadda.) I need to get the RSS fired up and the readership goin so I can get that book deal to save me from this fucking hole I call work.  urlLink Simon & Schuster ...are you listening? Save me.

      Air Supply never made a song that didn't concern love to some degree. That's a beautiful thing. To have that much love inside of you and the gee-tar is your only outlet. Most men will turn to the bottle, but not Air Supply. Rock and roll. Rock and fuckin roll.   urlLink    They Built this city.&nbsp; urlLink     In other news:  urlLink    I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever &nbsp; urlLink      Every now and then I get a little bit restless and I dream of something wild.  After I dislocated my fucking arm for the fiftieth time, I mosey on into Best Buy to literally lick my wounds. I walk directly to the TV section and decide that right then and there I HAD to have a new 13 inch TV for my BR. (Cause the 47inch TV in my LR isn't enough - -GO AMERICAN CONSUMPTION) While I stare at the TV's I decide that due to my bum wing...this might not be the best time to purchase the superfluous TV. So I pick up 3 DVD's ( urlLink War ,  urlLink War  &  urlLink Porn ) and bounce.   Can't wait for  urlLink the day after tomorrow   Michael  urlLink "Hard Earned Pay"  Williams

      Ok...update from this weekend. Friday night wasn't as bad as I imagined. Worked till about 12:45am. Got home at about 1:44am. I did manage to see some celebs. Now don't get all strange if I drop a few names. Adam from Maroon 5, Lindsay Lohan, Eliza Dushku and  Hillary Swank to name a few. When I finally managed to get away from my responsibilities at the front dealing with the humanity, I went upstairs to the party. I found my friend Masha in the main room. I'm chatting her up and then I notice her lean over to Hillary Swank and say something to her privately. Obviously I was curious as to what the hell she said. Masha then tells me that a few minutes earlier Hillary came over to her and told her that she was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen and that she has been staring across the room all night. Sweet Jesus. That's a compliment for Mz. Masha huh? Crazy. Other than that the night was fairly uneventful. It wasn't too hot or too cold so I can't complain about being outside the whole time.  Saturday I went swimming at the gym on Whitehall street. Nice place, damn near deserted. I love lower Manhattan on the weekends. After swimming I went up to union square to the green market.   Today I went running in Central park. There were what seemed like a million people milling around. There was some pro Israel rally...so needless to say lots of cops and random Israel supporters. The weather was beautiful. The biography clock / thermometer said it was 84 degrees. I enjoyed the run. I did the 6th ave entrance - around the Reservoir and back down.   It's still pretty hot right now. I trying to avoid using the AC till at least June. Right now my  urlLink remote-controlled lasko  is the only thing keeping me sane.

      My first entry on this blog. I have another blog which will remain unnamed as it was merely a trial run. it's only partially discontinued. Well this blog is coming courtesy of my lovely wi-fi connection, my newly purchased  urlLink cloud-9 chair  and my recently utilized roof deck. God I love Brooklyn. I love my neighborhood more and more everyday. The wi-fi took a little coaxing...but i made it work. Speaking of work, I should probably tell you about my day. I think that my work life is focused on the wrong things. I literally spent my entire day trying to arrange a 35 minute interview. I have been trying, back and forth, for three weeks to get this damn thing scheduled. All so some retard in Detroit can read FHM and buy a tracksuit. Good lord how did i end up this way. Tomorrow (Friday) I have the launch of the new Calvin Klein underwear collection. We have to work from 5pm to midnight. On a Friday night mind you. I might as well work at a movie theater. Well at least I get played well. Wait a minute...I don't make any money. Ohhh that reminds me, look on craigslist for a part time summer job. I sold my old stereo on craigslist today. I should send Craig a couple of dollas. It's a lot quicker and cheaper to sell on craigslist and FREE. I can't believe the response I got. So many emails. Either way I made a couple hundred bucks...which is good cuz American express has a hit man looking for me.  Michael  urlLink "Hard Earned Pay"  Williams

       It might as well be updated Quarterly. I mean, really. I've commissioned  urlLink Bruce Weber  to do the creative. I need more homoerotic imagery in this blog.   New York has brought a few things to light for me...New annoyances. First being: people that swing their motherfucking arms when they walk down the street. If I can't walk thru garmento land without you hitting me with your giant grandfather-clock like arm swinging, there has to be something wrong. Second, non-rush hour middle seat usage. If it's not rush hour...DON'T sit in the damn middle seat.   I constantly have competing themes for my life. I'm either trying to be faux-gay, hipster, Midwest frat-boy, etc etc. My current them is a granola eating, liberal voting tree huger. That being said: I recently purchased a very nice Specialized mountain bike. I have been riding it all over prospect park. I see lots of nature and all of the amazing nooks and crannies that PP has to offer. I also see lots of the very questionable shit that happens on a daily basis in the park. Even the squirrels look suspect. Quick hits:    I think I fell in love with San Francisco over craigslist. (as if my sexual orientation could be more questionable)   I want to go 3 NFL games this coming season. All in different cities. Last year I went to Browns at San Francisco, Raiders @ Browns and an Eagles game at Lincoln Financial field.   urlLink Nomah now Nomar  Boston fans are lame.
