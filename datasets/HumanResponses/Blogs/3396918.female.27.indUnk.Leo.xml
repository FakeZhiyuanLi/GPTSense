       I brought Pepper to Sentosa today. Expected a warm and sunny afternoon. It doesn't turn out that way. Been raining since morning. I nearly want to give up going there. Luckily the rain stopped before the appointed time I'm suppose to meet the others. It's was a nice cooling afternoon. The only day I didn't get sunburned. There were 5 doggies there. Pepper, Rose, Cola, Coco and Minnie. Cola is the only stud among the bitches. A 3 month old stud who is very lecherous. He wanted to hump Minnie and Coco. Had to push him away from the bitches. He had no interests in Pepper though. Think he preferred white bitches.    Minnie was a poor gal today. Cola started to chased and bited her when she first arrived with her "parents". Her "mummy" just stood down there watching her being bullied by Cola. Finally Minnie had met her match. She was always the one who bullied others. She had her taste of her own medicine today. Thanks to Cola. My Pepper is still the most obedient among the group :)

        My good old days are going to be over soon. Starting to get busy with the 2 stupid protocols. What the heck! Have to do it one after another. I'm not sure whether I'm up for it. These two days , I nearly have to do overtime. Luckily, I'm still able to drop everything and leave for home on time. I'm not the type to stay back to do work unless it is very urgent. So that's me, "shang ban yi tiao chong, xia ban yi tiao long" :)    The gals are going for a movie (Movie title-The day after tomorrow) tomorrow after work. Janistary told me a joke today regarding the movie title. Her hubby was driving her and Pacific Ocean home yesterday(wed)when the gals asked him whether he wants to watch the movie with them (which is auppose to be on fri). He asked for the movie title And his dear wife told him is the day after tomorrow (movie title). He replied I know is the day after tomorrow (fri) but what is the movie's name. Janistary replied the movie title again. He replied I know the movie is on friday. Get the joke??????????????? He mistoke the movie title for friday. I was laughing away when Janistary told me this. A booster jab for me for the day.

         Hehehehe!!! I'm smiling at last today. Think the mood swing is over. Hope that I don't talk too fast and the mood swing come back to find me tomorrow. I was occupied the whole day. Non-stop for the 8hrs. Time flies faster~~~~ I prefer that way rather than being free. Too free will be like bluesky, feel boring the whole day.    Just taught Pacific Ocean and Janistary how to do the blog after work today. Hope that they will start using it. If not, I'm going to knock their heads. Make me stayed in the office after work.

         I'm still moody today. Not sure whether is it PMS. Hope that it will go off soon. Hate this feeling. Furthermore I have to do my stupid PM. The worst is that my brain is dead now so quite hard to revive it. With my brain gone, I still have to do this PM thingy. Hai.......................................     Bluesky's sis is going to Melbourne today. I want to go also :( Missed Melbourne. Atarena, why don't we switch place???? I stay in Melbourne to rot and you stay in Singapore to rot. I WANT THE WINTER WEATHER........................... So hot here. I'm more a polar bear. Want to stay in the north pole type.

         I'm not sure what happens to me today. I'm really in a bad mental state. Today everything looks unpleasant to me. Really not in the mood to joke or laugh. Maybe it's because of work, people, stress, biological............ I'm not sure. I can only declared today is a cloudy day.     I have a lot of grievances to say out. Can't seems to put it into words though. Well thought this blog is suppose to serve this purpose but it doesn't work. Hai...........     Maybe it's just a bad day. It will be better tomorrow. I hope~~~~~~~~

        I saw the movie Van Helsing with Angel this afternoon. My verdict : Prefer Van Helsing to Troy. Even though Troy has more good-looking guys than Van Helsing. I don't like Troy because the characters in there were all involved in the war for the stupid reasons. Prince Paris was for love but he was a coward and brought the downfall of his country. Archillies was for fame but at least he is a fighter. The stupid fat King was for his own selfish desire for power. The only honorable character is Prince Hector who died for his country. Make me wonders what is life all about!!!!    Van Helsing is a movie about Dracula (Vampire) and Van Helsing (Hunter of the dark turn Werewolf). From young I have been fascinate with Count Dracula. I remembered watching a movie of him when I was very young. I'm not really frightened of him then. Just find that he was a interesting guy.

        I just saw eyez's comment on my blog. So glad to hear from her. I feel so guilty that I missed her wedding. Sorry~~~~~~ I have no spare cash then and Mable decided not to go in the end too as she doesn't want to get $$$ from her parents. Furthermore, I didn't let you know that we were not going. I have disappointed her again and again by not going to Penang. I have not been a trusty friend. I have not been e-mailing her recently. Hope that by using this blog, she will know how I'm getting with my life.  p.s. A zillion apologies, my dear friend for letting you out of my life for quite some time~~~

        I just came back from the gossip session with the Lilly folks. Seems like there are few capable people in Lilly. Well, frankly speaking it's none of my business as it's not my problem. I just do whatever I'm suppose to do.     I really have no aim in life now. Nothing interest me and I'm like a zombie. Go to work, back home, watch tv programmes and sleep. Everyday is the same routine. It's only when I go out with the Lilly folks then it break the routine. I'm looking forward to the trip to Melbourne.

         So sian~~~~ My life is so boring. Don't know what to do everyday. I missed Ginger~~~Saw Atarena's blog just now. Her posting today is written by Ginger, topic~A day at the park. Ginger has a lot of friends. She is very sociable unlike Pepper. Pepper is treating those bitches and studs as aliens. I think she thought herself as a human being. Well, the blame is on me and my family. She is the queen in the family.      Seems like everyone at work is so busy especially Vivien. I don't have the motivation to work. Although I have things to do (non-urgent ones). Don't feel like doing it. I'm rotting away..........................................................................

Atarena suggested just NaNa but I have already type in the 76. HMmmmmmm Not sure still can change. Try it out later. Or maybe I have change it already????? I quite slow in terms if these online thingy. Always make Baobao furious. Hehehehe!!! Aways ask her to help me set up internet access, ICQ n MIRC when we were at Deakin hostel. Furthermore, I don't know how to use it when it's already set up.  Pepper is knocking on my door. She wants to come in. This gal, always come in n out. Let the air con dewarmed.

        I went Zouk tonight with the TTSH kakis. Very fun~~~Nearly didn't managed to go as I was having diarrhoea the whole day at work. Furthermore, a lot of work to do. We went by Velvet and it was very crowded inside. I didn't even go to the dance floor. Angel managed to squeeze herself in with some others. She said she can't even moved her arms. Imagined that!!! CherLi (supermom) and I went over to Zouk instead. It was playing trance then. Reminded me of Melbourne clubbing days. Missed the Melbourne style of trance. I think I'm old and rusty already. I couldn't even lasts for a full hour, unlike the past. Hai!!!! Overall - Fantastic!!! At least a bit of exercise for me :)    Drove to West Coast Park MacDonalds for some food after that. 24 hours drive thru. I woke Pepper up from her sleep when I got home. She was so funny when she walked. Like half asleep. I shared with her the food I bought from Mac. Yum Yum~~~ Nothing beats a meal after clubbing. Hehehee!! In that case, the exercise earlier was sort of wasted ;p

        Today was so chaotic at work. First thing in the morning, breakfast for the subjects went MIA. The gal in charge was panicking so L and JL had to go search for the breakfast. Heard they went "running" while looking for the trolley filled with high fat food. One thing went wrong in the morning, the rest will follow. Think this might be true. Today was a jinx. One thing happened after another. Poor R and JL had to sort things out after the peak period.      Lucky for me, I'm not so affected by the chaotic. At least the part that doesn't involved me..... I was dammed "pek chey" when the stupid ECG read AMI. Had to report and did a repeat. Waste time and I still had others to do. I suspected it was beacause the subject moved when it was saving it into the disk. Made me ran from one room to another with the stupid result. Early in the morning made me exercise!!!!!After my turn, the rest of the jinx followed. The room was so full of noise, like a market..... Now I really believe in Jinx~~~~

           My days are so boring. Not much activities. The reasons......... too lazy to go out, too tired after work, no kakis (half true), no money (very true) and no aim~~~~ My life have been slow and steady if not from some excitement from this special someone (you know who you are). Your life is much more exciting than mine. But more problematic as well. I'm trying very hard to keep a neutral stand while giving you advice...As I don't want to impose my values on you. It's your life so you should be responsible for it. Sometimes you make me laugh and sometimes you make me "fan". Maybe you should give me 50% of you excitement and I give you 50% of my stability. Then we will balance up :)    My dear friend, just be yourself and think twice before jumping into anything. I will always be a call away :)

          Pepper's Dinner - 1 Boiled Chicken Drumstick, 1 Boiled Carrot and 3 Spoonful of Rice. Looks and sound delicious!!!! My sis's dinner didn't look that good as Pepper's. Hehehehe!! I have spolit her, I know. But I can't help it. Those who knows me will ..............      After chatting with Atarena yesterday about dog food........ I decided to get chicken for her today. Since it's a must for a veggie, I think carrot will be a better choice than lettuce. Cos carrot can lasts longer (my own assumption only) ;P

        Today is my SUM. Asked Kent to set up the video recording but in the end..... He tried the new recording system. Supposed to be high tech with all the microphones and wireless keyboard and mouse. In the end, we wouldn't capture the sound in the recording. Have to re-tape it tomorrow again~~~~ Dammed "sway" nowadays.    I went to Pet R Us after work to buy Pepper's food. Supposed to go at 4.30pm sharp but was delayed by Rachelle. She also want to go but she is so slow in going home........ For me, I'm like a dragon when I'm off duty :) I was supposed to go yesterday but because I waited for her nearly 1 n half hours and she still cannot leave... I went home instead. Poor Pepper had to eat Canidae instead. Bought Pepper a very expensive box of biscuits. Cost me $13. And she doesn't like it......... "Bo Wei Kong"

        I have been feeling down lately. Not sure why??? Think maybe stress/displeasure at work. Think it's really getting into me. Really feel like shit working. Have to defence myself from here and there......    This morning might be the utimate. Spolit my day early in the morning. I was assigned to assist YS in the HJAE Admssion ECG yesterday. I was just helping to put the leads and taking it off when we were done. Therefore I had no idea on what's the readings of all the ECG. First thing in the morning, JL told me that there was 1 subject's ECG that stated AMI (nobody was informed). Asking me whether I knew about this. I was shocked as YS didn't mentioned anything at all to me. When JL ask YS about it, she said there was 1 AMI and SHE MENTIONED TO ME!!!!! FUCKING BITCH.....................I later learned that she sorted of knew how to interpreted the readings. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! She is not a doctor. What the shit is she trying to do. Make me to double work today checking on her work. Waste TIME!!!! Not only that......    Later in the day, she had to do the ECGs again. I thought luckily I don't have to partner with her this time round. BUT I STILL GANNA FROM HER MISTAKE!!! DAMMED SWAY TODAY.... Subjects were supposed to rest supine for 5 MINS before the ECG. But she did that 10 mins in advance. So I kindly reminded her that it is only 5 MINS but the egoistic fellow said IT'S IS AT LEAST 5 MINS. Fine with me cos I'm not the one doing the ECG. But Maggie (CRA of the protocol) questioned me instead. Asking me why we were not following instructions. Dammed it, not my business but still ganna. My face was so black the whole day. Ganna stab in the back for nobody business. Next time have to wear amour to work.

         It's been quite a while since my last posting. I went Orchard yesterday. Was supposed to just get the Hep B vaccination jab then go shopping. But the nurse was not on duty so have to see the doctor instead. I had to wait for an hour+ just to get the stupid jab. Since had to wait so long, might as well see the doc for my suppose "ringworm". Luckily I seen the doc, if not I won't know that the "ringworm" is just an allergy. I been applying the wrong cream for 1 week+.      Immediately after the consultation, I went Mphosis to get some sandles. 50% off storewide. But not much size left for the designs I want :( So just bought 1 pair only. After meeting up with rest of the gang, we went URS. Hehehehe!!! I bought another pair of heels. Cheap~Cheap~Cheap!!! Wanted to buy some stuff from Lee Hwa but unsuccessful. Luckily didn't buy any, if not will be very broke now. I'm going to meet Angel tomorrow. More shopping!!!! :)

         I'm not sure what came over me these few weeks. Stress??? Mood swings??? I had been feeling out of shape since mid June. Too much work maybe??? Well, that's bad for mental health and physical health. I think this current job is not much different from the previous one. It's made me stone a lot. Worse still, I nearly black out a few times ~~~ Think might not be able to cope already. Hai!!! Another month to go......    So I just went and cut my hair real short 1 hr ago to de-stress (weird thingy to do). With my big round face, a short hair style is not advisable. But I don't care, need something different in life. Fed up with the shoulder length limpy hair. Think to "gu niang" for me. I'm still a tomboy at heart. So I just told the hairdresser, cut as short as possible. She suggested GI cut jokingly. I'm tempted but dare not try. Face too big!!!

        Haven't been blogging for some time. These past two weeks were the busiest time I have encountered in Lilly. I was wiped out totally. Been staying back after work until I'm like a zombie now. Dragging myself every step or will stone out or black out.... The boss even knows I stay back until 8+pm. Wonders how he knew???? Since he was overseas then.     I have to lead this kind of life for another month. Hai!!! Really need a break after that. Melbourne looks heavenly to me now.

      My working life is more or less back to normal now. This week no overtime yet till this hour. Hope that's it will continue :) Bluesky, Ocean and me are looking forward to the bright light at the end of the tunnel (Melbourne)!!! I'm still stuck at the dark tunnel now, really hope the time will pass quickly so that I will see the bright light soon. Unfortunately, I have a strong hunch that I will see the black tunnel again after my Melbourne trip. Mainly end of the year. I really pray that my hunch is wrong. My six sense is always quite right on the dot, hope that this time will be wrong.  I bought some toys for Ginger yesterday. So happy :) I wanted to pack my luggage immediately. Too early for that. Bluesky and Ocean also have the same feelings too (packing). We really look forward to this trip. I have already planned my makan itenary ;p Yum Yum
