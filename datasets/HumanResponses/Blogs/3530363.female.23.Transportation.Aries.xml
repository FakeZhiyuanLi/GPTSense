      I erased a whole fucking post again. Trust me it was brilliant. I spoke of my long trip. My lack of sleep. My crappy ride home. Jay and I getting along this week. He wants to pay for the pill. Slow night at work last night. Decided to start a cabdriver's blog.       >See Below>I find it really interesting that it left the one ingrediant empty. I think that actually speaks worlds. And it was completely random. All I did was type in my name and that's what It came up with. Hmm.   I had a splitting headache all night last night. Grr. And speaking of grr, this guy Sean all the sudden wants to date exclusively. I met him friggin once and he wants exclusiveness. Um.. hello?   You know I havent written in like 2 weeks and there was all this stuff I wanted to say, but now I can't think of a damn thing to say. I guess that's what's bad about not updating often enough. You forget what happened from day to day that was really important at the time but then tomorrow is here and there's a whole new day of shit to deal with, yesterday fades, and suddenly it's not as important. Actually that says a whole lot about life. I guess it all tends to be that way. Here today gone tomorrow. Look at me an armchair philosipher at 7 in the morning. (In a kitchen chair rather than armchair no less.)   So I'm supposed to call Jay at 8:00 to go out to breakfast. I am freaking starving. Really I shouldn't be, I shouldn't be eating at all at this time in the morning. I should be going straight to bed. But I want to see him, and I need to go to the bank, and I need to mail a Congrats on Your Baby Boy to Ken. Boy is that some funny shit. Jody has the baby 2 weeks before her due date which is over a month early for when she says she got pregnant to begin with. Then she dosen't tell anybody she had the baby. She talks to Tina from the hospital, and never happens to mention she's in fact in the hospital, and just gave birth. Then we find out the baby is a Graham. Nice. What a fucking whackjob. So I'm mailing an anonymous card to Ken. That was like the best idea I had ever heard.  Since I came back Spanky has some kind of weird bump growing out of her back. It looks like it's all crusty, but I don'want to touch it. I'm already fraking about having to pick her up to clean the cage. Crusty bumps are not cool.   It was father's day today. I took dad out to his fave diner over on King George Road. It was actually a good time. We hung out afterwords in the backyard for like an hour just talking. We don't do that very much, especially without arguing. He was really pissed at Mark. One, for getting oil stains all over the driveway, and just coming here all the time and hanging out using all Dad's car wash stuff, and the water and everything else just because it's free when he really has no right to do so since Dad owns the house. But also because he made Dad park in the street the other day, the neighbors mowed the lawn with no bag on the mower so all the grass went on the car and baked on, and it must have spit out a rock and it nicked a big spot on the tire rim. He's really really pissed about that.   All right I'm gonna go finish setting up the other blog and run. Mom will kill me if I go over the time.  I can't believe how fucking hungry I am.

      FUCK! I had written all this shit, and accidentally x'd out the box thus losing everything. FUCK! To sum it up I'm leaving in less than 8 hours. All packed, don't forget anything. Don't want to leave. Sure I'm gonna get searched, sick grandma alone & young bad story. Hope smooth crossing. Uncle Edward got breakfast & lunch buffet. Gonna be fat. Hot dogs for dinner, Cheesecake bites must be eaten. Went food shopping, library, said bye to Jeanne, & Tant Joe. Watched sunset & fog rolling on water pretty. Looking for porn sux too slow. Wish journey home was faster. I think that's about it only much faster.   I talked to Jay last night for some time. Had interesting sex talk. Always been worried to tell him about my fantasies, cause I'm afraid that I may not like what I tell him. Last night was about violent ass sex. Which in theory sounds really fucking good, it's just a matter of it being good for long in real life. I think grandmere is coming in for bed now so I gotta run. I will update as soon as I get home Wish me luck!!!!

      So I'm officially leaving Tuesday. I won't be home until Sunday sometime though. Dammit. This is gotta be the longest travel time EVER! I could probably swim home faster. Gotta be at the boat at 7:00 Tue. morning. Mary will pick me up in Maine that night around 9 or 10. Camille will come to Connecticut Friday night. When I'm told I'll be babysitting. Head back to Jersey Saturday where my mother will pick me up Sunday. I wouldn't mind spending the week at Mary's except for the fact that Scott totally creeps me out. When I was on my way up here last month, and we got there he was wasted and kept telling me to sit next to him he needed to ask me something. Samantha was sitting next to me so I tell him to just ask, and he's all "nevermind". Then he says something all fast and quiet and when I ask him what he said he waves his hand like forget it. The fucking guy can be cool as hell when he wants to be, but most of the time he's so creepy. Propositioning me by way of asking if I'd tell Mary if he came to me in the middle of the night is not winning him any points. Hell, propositioning me at all ain't winning him no points!  Then sleeping at Camille's is no fun either. That fucking dog is obnoxious, and I hate sleeping in piles of dog hair. Plus the fact that I don't think either of us can stand each other.   I have been smoking like a fiend today. I have 1 left and I'm sure that will be gone by tonight. Which means no smoking tomorrow. It's gonna be phone bill day. Plus I'm gonna have no money at all for the boat, and I have nothing for the week I'll be at Mary's either. Damn I hate having no money. It's been awhile since I've been completely broke. My cell phone bill came in and that's another fucking $170, which I totally don't understand, I haven't been using it at all. Hopefully I don't have a warrant out when I get back for that fucking accident court date. I wish that could have been taken care of at the first court date I had. Fucking unprepared prosecutor. It should have been dropped to a fine 3 months ago.   Made chicken marinara tonight. Well I thought. I had taken the last 2 packets of meat out of the freezer. I thought it was 2 chicken breast, and 2 thighs. I bit into it and said "Oh I guess I overcooked the chicken", and grandmere says "And it's pork too". Whoops. But it was pretty good with the marinara sauce either way. Also sweet potatoes and corn w/ peas. We are going food shopping tomorrow morning, then grandmere has a funeral to go to.   Heard from Jay this morning. He says he was out with Ken all weekend. Says he was shooting pool last night. Only talked to him a little while, he said he'd see me online tonight, but I've been on almost 2 hours and no sign. Craig either, but he never seems to be around on weekends. Hopefully I can catch him tomorrow night and tell him I won't be on for the next week or whatever. Actually after tomorrow, I'll probably never talk to him online again. I'm NEVER online at home. Which also means I won't be updating this thing very often either. I wish I had thought to start doing this sooner. Could have documented the time up here much more. Plus it would have been a big help all those grouchy rag times. Maybe I can sign on the crappy computer at my place in the mornings when I get home from work. Gotta be quick about it though, Mom only gets like 5 hours dial up time or whatever. No long ranting bitch fests.   It was a pretty quiet day. Did some laundry. Had to handwash my hoodie Grr. Totally forgot to put it in the wash till I was done & drying things. It really needed it , it was all smelly from getting damp the other day swimming. Plus I can't remember the last time I washed it, and it's been like a second skin up here. Then hung out outside and read 2 Koontz novels. The Mask, and Funhouse. Listened to some music. Can't get fucking "Summer Sunshine" out of my head. Driving me nuts! Got some sunburn on my shoulders. These bug bites are driving me CRAZY! I mostly took care of one on my finger, I stabbed it with a needle and kept squeezing till just blood was coming out and it wasn't such a big bump anymore. Doesn't itch as much anymore. But I can't be stabbing myself all over the place. I have like 5 bites on my chest, and it seems like they are from various bug species. Some are average mosquito bites, but some are those giant teeth with wings marks that swell up like a friggin abscess.   Maybe tomorrow, while grandmere is at that funeral, I will take a walk in the woods. I can't believe I have been here over a month and haven't done that yet! I guess it would have been difficult to do so for most of it with all that rain & shitty weather. I know at a certain point back there it gets way too wet to walk through. I haven't been back there in years. The last time was with Joe for christ sake. But I remember we got to a point that there was just no walking past. I seem to remember someone losing a shoe. I don't know if it was from rain, or just natural, but we'll see tomorrow. I think it's supposed to be mostly nice. Maybe partly cloudy or whatever.   Ok so I'm gonna run, maybe hit some porn before grandmere decides to come to bed, I'll be on tomorrow for the last time before I get home. Bye!

      Today was a long day. Couldn't sleep very well last night. Slpet really light, and kept waking up. Got up at 8, spent the morning finishing up "Sphere" by Michael Crichton. Maurice called at 11 telling me he needed mr for like 15 minutes to do something in the garden at the camp. i told him I needed an hour. So I finished my book, jumped in the shower, and ran to the library cause they won't be open again untill Tuesday. Grandemere wanted me to look for some books for her also. Then I hit the grocery store to pick up a few odds & ends for Grandmere. Made it back at 5 after 12. So we run over to the camp, unroll a bunch of neetting to cover peas, and then plant said peas. Goddamn bugs; I feel like a human pincushion. I'm covered in bites! So then he wanted to run to the camp to pick up his paddle boat. So we get that in the truck and he pulls out a bottle of rum to take a hit. Subsequently he almost dies. I don't think rum is something you want going down the wrong pipe. So much choking & gagging ensues. Somehow he's able to drive. I was thinking about it if we were to get pulled over; and the cop asks me why I'm in the car with him driving like that I would have to tell the cop that he's been in that state as long as I've known him (since I was 2), and he's always driven. Hell, I don't know if the guy can drive sober! So this is what I'm thinking about all the way down the camp road.  Then we stopped at Jeanne & Yvettes' flea market to see how they were making out (very well!) They decided they would be ready by 3:45 or whatever. o he wants to go to the club to put his dollar in the lottery drawing which is up to $1000.  We shoot an abysmal game of pool, and by this time, I am DEFINATELY driving. Once again proving to myself that i can drive whatever you put me in no problem! :) So I help pack up and load the car & truck. Drive Maurice home and have Jeanne drive me & grandmere's exercise bike back here. Unload that and I'm finally home! When I remember that I still need to go pick up bread.  So I made breakfast for dinner. Bacon & scrambled eggs, toast for grandmere. I wanted a bacon & egg burger so I made a hamburger as well. was pretty good. I think we are going food shopping on Monday. After dinner I just passed out. Couldn't keep my eyes open worth a damn. I guess I slep about 2 hrs or so. Hope I can sleep tonight.  Haven't heard from Jay, no surprise there. I'm sure he's out there somewhere living it up. Doing shit he's never gonna tell me about. And Craig never seems to be around on weekends. Maurice (of all people) tells me I may be leaving this week. Nice of them to tell me! I had mentioned to grandmere that the 15th would be a good day to be home. Really want to see Vast! But if they want me to go on the Prince and tuesday's are 1/2 price day. It would have to be this Tuesday. Since next tues. is the 15th. Who knows?  Dad never put anything into my bank account like he mentioned he would. I don't know what I'm gonna do about the phone bill since Monday is definately going to be the day. Launch or whatever took thier money out as well, so there is now only $14 american left. I was hoping to at least have 20 bucks. Aside from the fact that inevitably, I had to spend some of what I had on me. I now only have like $30 to give her which is not going to be anywhere near enough. Fuck. Plus I seem to be smoking like a fiend lately. Bought a pack last night, and it's more than half gone already. I'm fiegning now. I can't wait to taste a freakin Marlboro again. These Canadian ciggerettes are rough!  Need to do laundry tomorrow. The clothes I was swimming in last night don't seem to want to dry, and they are going to start to smell soon. If they don't already.  My back is killing me. I don't know if it's from the firewood yesterday or what but damn! Not sure how exercising tonight is going to go as a result. But I need to do them. I've only been doing them once a day the past few days. Lazy ass. But at least I've been doing the other active stuff w/ Maurice.   I'm reading "The Mask" by Koontz (previously printed under Owen West) now and it seems to be a fairly easy read. Should have it finished by tonight. I only grabbed 2 books out of the library, plus the 1 for grandmere cause I was in a rush. they were both Dean.   Well, I guess I won't bore ya anymore for now. I seem to be writing a lot. But the subject matter is really friggin inane. I wouldn't read this if I were anybody else. As a matter of fact I wouldn't read it if I were me either. Certainly nothing interesting or noteworthy like some of these other blogs I've seen. I'm definately no Salaam, or Ugly Fat Kid...

      So Brr. I went out for a swim. Yeah it was fucking cold. Yeah.  Today was an interesting day at least. Woke up late, (another safe day yayy!) about 1/2 hour later Maurice calls and asks me to be there in an hour to unload a cord of wood. Sounds good to me, don't have to exercise this morning yayy. So I head over there, and we throw all this wood into Pierre's basement. Then we load the lawnmowers into the truck and head over to the camp. Mowing was fun! It makes it so easy when you have the ride on dealies. But my god, those bugs suck balls! They are like teeth with wings and god forbid they bite you. You get these humongous bumps like mosquito bites only worse. The proboscis hole is freaking HUGE! Maurice has this cool jacket though it's like a windbreaker, but instead of a regular hood, it goes over your whole face like a netting. Works pretty good, but it makes you feel like you are safaring (sp?) in Africa. So he keep telling me "Go get yourslef a cold beer" I swear the guy is trying to get me drunk! So after we mow all the lawns at the camp, and unloading all the equipment back at the house we head over to the club to pick up tables fro Yvette's yard sale. While we are there we play 1 game of pool. why is it htat whenever I am there I get all sorts of nasty looks? I know I am a guest, and I am not from around here, but I have not been looking too outlandish lately, I swear! So we head back here and load up grandmere's exercise bike for the sale, and Maurice leaves. I asked Grandmere if she would mind if I drink one of Maurice's beer if I replace it, and she sends me to the store to get a 12 pack. Why i don't know. So I do that (actually end up getting a 15 they are having a sale) and come home to make dinner. I had a hamburger and some tater tots, but I made grandmere scallops with minted pea puree which sounds really wierd (especially for me, I ain't eatin no fish!) but she says it was pretty good. Particularly the way I made the scallops. She says even if I don't do the pea thing to make the scallops that way again. I didn't do much though, all I did was pour some olive oil into the frying pan, toss some garlic powder, and a bunch of pepper, and heat it untill it smoked. Then I threw in the scallops, and just kept flipping them for 5 minutes. Apparantly I am some kind of good cook. i think I am mostly just adequite. Need to eat? Ok, I'll make something. That's pretty much it. up here has been a lot of experiments. "Let's see how this comes out" and so on. So far it hasn't been too bad. My fave was the "steam bake" or so I'm calling it. Breaded chicken, colored peppers, onions & sweet potatos wrapped in aluminum foil. 20 minutes in the oven and OH MY GOD! It was so freakin good!  A little off the subject, but I am fucking HORNY AS HELL today!  So after dinner I headed off to aunt francis' house to watch the sunset. She is dead and the house is empty, but what a view! I watched that for quite some time untill I couldn't take the sound of the waves anymore and I had to jump in. That takes me to Brr. Yeah it was cold.   But either way I have to run. Grandmere wants to go to bed. So ends a not so ranting rant. Maybe tomorrw I'll actually tell you how I feel.

      I am so freaking aggravated. I am trying to register on this website that has tix to see Vast on Carson Daly, and I can't get on to the fucking thing. I e-mailed the tech guys and no one is getting back to me. FUCK! I was going to try everything in my power to be back in time to go... that is if I could get tickets, but I am just so sure I could have gotten them if I could have gotten on. It is a time is of the essence thing too. Dammit. My 2 fave bands come around and I miss them both cause I'm up here. FF was like the day after I left.   I'm just in a really pissy mood today. Antsy, very antsy. It was another safe day at least. No phone bill yet.    Jay is being all weird. He's all quiet, at least he's on which is rare if I'm on. But he;s not really talking to me and I know he's gonna wanna sign off in 20 minutes. How does he manage to make me sooo fucking mad? I don't get it.   So I noticed that Stephen Root is absolutely everywhere, I was watching Ice Age today, and it's not that I recognized his voice just on a whim I looked a the credits for him, and sure enough there he was! Voicing 2 characters no less. He's also in Finding Nemo as well as Vicky Lewis. Gotta love News Radio!!! He's gonna be in Dodgeball which looks freaking hysterical! Harry Potter comes out tonight, I really want to see that. Gotta wait till I get home though. Grr, going home is gonna be a freaking bitch. Gotta work my ass off and move. Trepidation about that. But at the same time there is so much I wanna do. Wanna see Cheap Trick. Wanna take Joe out. Gotta see The Corrs. Need some new bras. One just ain't gonna cut it for much longer. REALLY want to see Vast. Doubtful that's gonna happen though. Plus Shrek is out and I really want to see that. Hopefully I can do Shrek & HP in one matinee day.   I miss working in music. I miss the old days working in the store w/ Jay. I still wonder if I had never gone to the warehouse would we have had the problems we did? Or would I be engaged by now? I'm so sick of being fucked up. I wish I didn't have the problems I did. I'm really really sick of being so lonely all the time. Lonely even in a crowd.   Of course he's signing off now. Fucking asshole. God he makes me so fuckingmad!! the im box was open for an hour now, and there were like 20 lines of conversation. I just don't want to be so fucking lonely anymore. AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! Fuck it.   Dinner was chicken wrapped in bacon with buttered Ramen noodles (no seasoning, bad sodium) and brussles sprouts. Tomorrow I'm gonna try that pea & mint scallops recipe for grandmere. Hope it turns out ok for her. I won't know either way, I don't eat that shit.   Where the hell am I gonna move? I'm pretty sure I can afford monthly rent & stuff, it's just saving up the security deposit and all that's the hard part. Plus my credit is shit. Fucking hospital.   This is really long, I'm surprised I have this much to write about. Well granted it's really boring shit, nothing of any interest for anyone to read, which again is cool no worries about editing myself... funny I find myself doing that anyway. I wonder why. I guess maybe I'm thinking Jay or someone I date will read it one day, but I'd rather they didn't. Privacy in plain sight. I just can't be dumb enough to tell them about it. When it comes to Jay though, I always want to tell him everything. I guess that's part of the reason I get so mad at him, cause I wanna tell him everything, yet he dosen't feel that way about me. The whole Sara thing... jesus. He keeps telling me I'm so wrong for feeling cheated on. But my god for like an entire year (while he was dating me) he has a realtionship with another girl that he COMPLETELY hides from me. Jesus christ, I didn't even know she existed. Sending gifts and whatnot. Honesty people, Honesty! I guess there are things I hide too, but that's now, not then. And even then I STILL want to tell him everything. He really killed the VERY little trust I had in people. I know I never really trusted him implicitly, but now there's nothing at all.   Well, I think I still had a lot to say, but grandmere wants to come in to bed so I gotta run. These are really gonna end up as some run on entries, I'm finding that as long as I have to type I'll just keep on going. Maybe I really am that psycho?  Anyway goodnight then.

      Ok, So now I'm here. Jay is making this whole big deal about this thing, so I figure maybe there is something to it. But then again I have the attention span of a 2 year old so it probably won't last long. I doubt anyone will read this, which is cool I guess which means I can actually write whatever I want and not have to worry about a goddamn person saying a goddamn thing! :)   Well here I am, stuck in Canada. It was actually a pretty big day though. A month here, I don't do anything, and then in one day my cousin (65 yr old cousin mind you) takes me to "the club" (yup scary place) to shoot some pool, and Jeanne & Yvette come over to play cards. (I won yayy) That is a big huge day here. I had another "safe" day today. The phone bill hasn't come yet. I am petrified of that day. Fear all morning. I really don't want to see grandmere freak out. So scared of what that bill is going to be. That 2 weeks Jay was in Tenn. is gonna be really bad. He wouldn't call me at all.  Even still he pretty much dosen't call unless I call him, or take the first step somehow. Even yesterday, I told him I am online all night. He still dosen't show. I gaurentee he'll pop on like 2 minutes before I gotta go. (holy shit I guess I meant it when I titled this thing rants! I sound like a freaking lunatic I think)   But I guess I'm still just really hurt. I shouldn't be, I'm moving on too I think, but sometimes I just don't want to. Even though things suck, I still think we should be together. What the fuck is wrong with me? I guess I just need that final safety step to move on. The way it was with Mike when I met Jay. There's something to think about. I feel like I'm bieng just as guilty of all the things I blame him of, but in reality, I'm really not. We aren't dating, I'm didn't do anything while we were together... then again I'm not really doing anything now... it's just getting mad at him for not paying enough attention to me. Which sounds really selfish I think,  but that's not quite how it is. I just want him to extend the same fucking courtesies I do him.  So I met this dude online, but I don't know if that's really gonna go very far. I don't get this online crap. Jay was so into it (still is). I doubt it's gonna last much past up here. We'll see...   But anyway for dinner I defrosted the last of the stuffed (and not so stuffed) cabbages over spagetti. We need to go food shopping! I think I'm gonna put that in here, what I make for dinner... it's a good way to keep track. Once I get home of course that won't be a feature as I don't eat dinner at home. That is if my crappy attention is still focused opn this thing. Probably not if for no other reason then lack of computer time.  I hope no one actually is reading this, and if so how the fuck did they get this far? I know, there is no actual theme, and it's mostly me looking like a psycho...  Holy shit what did I tell you. Here it is 12:01 and who shows up? What An Asshole. Ok now I'm pissed so anything I type is going to be really nasty. Guess I should go now.

         My life is rated NC-17.  What is your life rated?     Yup that's me, although it's been a good 2 weeks since I've had any anal sex. but I did recently sit between 2 guys that are interested in me, and neither one had a clue about the other one. Tina would be so proud!
