       You all have probably wondered what your significant other would do without you and some may have even asked. I think I got the best answer last night from Tom. I asked what he would do if I was shot and killed in a robbery and he&nbsp;replied after thinking about it for a few minutes that&nbsp;he would carry on with the rent on the apartment we share for as long as he could. Wow. That's exactly what I would be worried about if I was bleeding to death on the floor..."Oh no! Will Tom keep the apartment?!" Whew, what a load off my mind.

       Hmmm. I think today might have possibly topped yesterday. I went in to work and shortly after we opened we were robbed. (I work at a large bank that shall forever remain nameless but you might now of it it is big, green and has a logo like a pacman that likes to eat other smaller better banks.)I had been called to the desk (where I used to work before my bank got eaten by said pacman and they decided I wasn't good enough for the position because I believed in finding the right product for the customer not the sell-sell-sell attitude that makes the bank so large but so untouchable by the average person.) because my assistant manager (one of the great minds&nbsp;at the branch...Oops was that sarcasm?) wanted me to help her make signs for the big FC day on Friday. She needed help cutting paper into cute shapes in other words, good to see my three plus years opening accounts and closing loans paid off here at "chez craphole" I get to cut little pieces of construction paper like a 2nd grader. Well a few seconds after we start snipping like mad women we get notified by one of the tellers that she was just robbed. Yay. Now just for the record when bank robberies in new England happen its not normally like in the movies with the uzis and people with ski masks and the whole locking some poor schmuck in the vault thing, its usually some poor sucker who has a drug addiction and the I.Q of a baked potato that quietly(and sometimes politely) asks for the money and leaves. The real circus starts after when dealing with the police, FBI and security weenies that think they are on dragnet that show up after.&nbsp; Well we survived the disaster and went on plugging for the rest of the day where I got home, went to mix up some yummy gerbil medicine and grabbed my new pill cutter to cut the dosage to the right size for the new water bottles I&nbsp;picked up&nbsp;to give the meds in when I noticed this funny plastic barrier covering the razor blade that cuts the pill. "Well" I say "how is it going to cut the pill with something covering the cutter I wonder" and place my pudgy little digit over the plastic which moves aside and I get to watch in horror as my finger parts like the red sea over the blade. As I bandage said pudgy digit I look down at the box that shows a nice illustration of my new pill cutter that has a cute little arrow pointing at the plastic barrier that says "NEW Blade Guard TM   for added safety." DOH! It cuts pills nicely with said protective shield by the way.

       Oh my god. I think losing the entire thing I just wrote should be placed&nbsp;at #1 of the list of&nbsp;many reasons why today would inspire me to drink a large glass of bleach.&nbsp;Well ok we know #1 ont the list of suck but here is the rest of my day in a nutshell. I woke up, tried to hop out of bed and hit a huge pile&nbsp;of blankets on the floor and slipped. Not so bad because I didn't fall. I had new clothes to wear today so I&nbsp;was pretty happy about that, plus I got some super cute underwear with&nbsp;a stripey pattern on them(I have a thing for obnoxious underwear designs...Its a girl thing.) so that was&nbsp;a pretty good start of the day plus I had Tom to give me a ride and my Dunkin Donuts coffee was excellent this morning which always makes me happy. I was early for work, not a bad thing it gave me some time to hang out with Tom and listen to the second CD of Avantasia I picked up while we waited for someone to let me in. D.A was the first&nbsp;to show,&nbsp;she is my supervisor that they hired a month or so ago and she is great. Well D.A informs me while we are going to enter the building that she is being transferred and was asked to step down.&nbsp;I am crushed. She was the best person they had in there. There are a lot of people that&nbsp;should have their jobs looked at and asked to step down and D.A is not one of&nbsp;them. I also got violently ill most of the day (something I&nbsp;ate). I came home hoping to relax and I found out my gerbils babies have a respitory infection and I have to give them antibiotics for ten days and even then they might not all live.&nbsp;I don't know if anyone out there has small animals but let me tell you 3 babies and 3 adult gerbils plus one&nbsp;eyedropper and one clutzy human make for quite the show. Oh well maybe tomorrow will&nbsp;go better....After all then it will be 9 more days of antibiotics. Oy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       This is a test of the emergency blogging system. If this had been a real message the occupant of this space would have thought it through before clicking that tantalizing little button that brought her here to post this nonsense. Thank you.

      Well Tom is away for most of this week only to come back on Friday to pack for his three week stint in CA.. It is three weeks there, come home for a week and then another three in CA. He will be gone on my vacation and my birthday again, I secretly think Best Buy is trying to sabotage our relationship! (JK) I have posted pictures of all my pets down below simply because I could. I am bored and lonely and it seems that the only thing I can count on being there for me is my pets and that's not their doing they just haven't figured out how to pop the top off the cage yet. Feeling depressed and just generally cruddy. Going to bed soon, was supposed to clean the house but didn't feel like it. I will do it this weekend when I am not tired form too much overtime at work and not enough sleep.

      Alright I admit it...I have a problem. I am addicted to pets. I have now taken in a hamster that nobody else wanted to go along with the five gerbils (soon to be 6) that stand in thier own display cabinet of glass aquariums.  A quick word to the wise for anyone that can be out there thinking of getting a hamster or small pet out there, those cute cages with the tubes and cute little compartments look fun but they suck ass to clean! Miss hammie is getting popped into a ten gallon glass palace today and thats that!
