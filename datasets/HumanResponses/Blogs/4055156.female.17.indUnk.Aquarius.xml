      I don't get the deal with people, why are the so ignorant and just do the things they do!? I don't get it...like cummon...you think they know someone but you really don't...Whatever, it's alright...I wrote that first part when I was in a bad mood...Now Jordan just gave me a lecture about how "good" of a person I am and how I have all these qualities that he wishes he had...I don't get it...like people are retarded, are we just brought into this world to all be backstabbing bitches!? I dunno, this world is fucked in it's own way.... ---------------------------------------------------------------------That was last night...here's for today ---------------------------------------------------------------------Mood swings...why have I been having so many of them, like...why do they happen!? What's going on...This is messed up, I don't like feeling like this...I'm SO happy, then I'll sit there and I won't be anymore....I'm not the same Erika right now...what's going on!? I feel like I'm in a movie that has the worst ending ever...Like I'm gonna die from some disease or something...I dunno man, it's messedup, and like the way people talk...You do one thing...it's your life, it's what you decided to do, and they have to judge you on it, what's with that!?  Everything is always so messed up these days man, like I seriously am thinking about going to Australia for like a month or so when I get enough money for it...Would that be cool or what!? But I'll write more later, we're going to watch a movie --Erika   Ok I lied it's like a day later, BUT what can ya do eh!?

      By the time you're all done reading these, you'll know me inside out...and if you don't, then there's something wrong with you!   Well, I just got home from "party" jumping lol We went to the campground...that was lame, Cool Cousin was there, she was prolly the only person happy to see Heather and I lol it was funny, then Seth and Ghis were all fighting and shit pretending to be serious...Stupid fucks cut their hands lol...I was just about to start having fun when we left to JPs house...wow...when I was there I haven't laughed that hard in a looooooong time! Stoned people are SO funny even when you're completely sober! Man those people (I won't say names cuz yeah some people may not want that!) And yeah, I tried to get Heather to teach me to be mean, she told me to do what she does to Ghis...It's not gonna work for me, heather, sorry dude! lol you gotta teach me better, oh great obie-wan! but yeah  Things are messed up, I keep thinking about that dream....it's messed up, it's gotta mean that for every like 3 things that go bad in ur life, there's gonna be one or more thing(s) that come out of it that make you forgive everyone and everything...It's true though, if you think about it...like when my dad had cancer...and grampa...and we moved...look at that, 3 things gone bad in my life, all taken back with my friends Jordan and Heather and GRADUATING! like there ya go....3 more things...think about like 3 bad things in your life, and then think of one AMAZING thing in your life....good eh?? If you think about that all the time, I'm sure you'll feel better about your life, like cummon, I've had a rough life...Most of you may not know, but it's not like it was HORRIBLE, just rough...bad luck I gues, if it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all! that's what my mom says!  Hmm...I'm sitting here at 2 in the morning...just thinking about how stupid guys can be...like wow...it's weird man...I dunno I don't wanna go into this...but hey...why not!? I lived here for 14 years...then I moved and didn't come back too often...and then I change into a completely different person, looks and all, but I'm still myself, and people around here notice me! I don't get it, it's mostly guyys, the girls knew I was there, they just were in a different "clique" then me and you all know how girls are in little school to grade 11...DONT TALK TO PEOPLE OUTTA UR CLIQUE!!! Whatever, I'm wasting my time on worrying about this shit! and guys...they've just gotta learn to stop being so damn confusing! It's a complicated situation...so nevermind!!!  Onto more important things....uhh wait, I don't have any...WAIT Tuesday for all you people in GP, I'm going to there for uh...Tues, Wed, Thurs and maybe Friday...so yeah gimme a call at my home for that time period and I MAY be able to fit you into my busy schedual!! It's cool man I am loved everywhere! HA joking, I wish! That'd be cool....I wanna be from a small town near a big city with a cool name...RIGHT HEATHER!? like Bonanza, it's a small town near a big city (Dawson) and it has a cool name...or uhh...Pouce Coupe it's by Dawson and has a cool name! lol I like how I get made fun of for calling "small cities" BIG cities...hey SETH I have my different outlook on cities OK! lol you're cool though...love the face expressions and the complicated way you talk..."Go down the stairs to the tunnel on the right, and it'll be the third door on the left"  ...Right Seth...get Glen lost in the basement! lol Poor Glenny! None of ya'll have changed yet and DONT EVER I wanna come back here in like a million years and see that you are STILL THE SAME! lol like when we're dead and in heaven, you'll be all ..uh...funny...and whatnot....yeah..that's it...and we'll be teling people on earth the confusing ways and using them as our puppets! Good fun now! lol man o man...I gotta stop writing, I'll write more tomorrow! WAIT FOR MORE ADVENTURES FROM.... MRS. BUMKIN ( lol Heather and Barnacle boy!) Love you all Miss you all Erika

      Well, Hinton is pretty interesting...Jordan is one cool guy, I'm so glad I have him as a friend...Seriously, he does anything and everything for me and I say anything around him. He's just a cool guy! That's all I gotta say, and as for Heather, she's cool too. It's not like I need a TONNE of friends, I just need a couple close ones like I have and not have to worry about having people say shit about me and stuff, it's great!!  But yeah, I dunno I'm so glad to have the people around me I do, and as for you people reading this, you're prolly one of those special people in my life...I'm all mellow and shit so yeah don't mind if this is all mushy and stuff...PLUS this is what's inside my mind right now...  All I wanna do right now is find a cool guy. One that'll do anything for me and just have a lot of fun with me...Not like get larried and stuff, but like just find a cool guy that'll just wanna have fun and be happy! lol that sounds REALLY corney...but hey, that's what I think life should be all about, being happy! You people are lucky, this is what's REALLY inside my head...yeah it's messed up, I've been told, but pretending to be someone you're not isn't a cool thing at all! I went too many years doing that (when I lived in Hinton) and I was sick of it, that's why I was SO happy when I heard we were moving...Cuz now I'm me, and that's all I have to be, and people are accepting me for me...it's really cool, and school's over so I may not have all that many friends right now, but the ones that I still talk to are AWESOME! I love you all to DEATH! I mean it!  Umm yeah things in Hinton are alright, the parties are good, lol Seth's was the best lol my leg (heather) and just chillin with people that don't remember me, although I'm sure some people did cuz someone told me someone was asking who I was and if I lived here b4! it was kinda cool! I was SO drunk...I mean...Uhh..WHAT!:-O Hah, what can ya do eh!?  I'm sitting here in the basement as I type...and it's making me think about a lot of stuff cuz I'm sitting here by myself listening to music...I forgot my sister's bday 2 days ago, so I feel like shit and I had a dream last night that Hell was full so it was coming to earth, like that movie, and like everything went bad, and I found my "bf" that I had in my dream and he was the BEST ever! It really makes me think that like dreams mean something..like this one would mean that bad things are gonna happen on the way, but when it's done, something is gonna come out of it that will make ur life WAY better...I dunno about you all, but that's what I think....Umm I'm running out of things to say so yeah ...I'm out LOVE YOU ALL to BITS!

      Well, I went to Grande Prairie and it was amazingly fun! Didn't party hard, just visited but it was still fun! I miss everyone in GP! I REALLY DO! Umm not a lot happened...I think I'm falling for someone tho...It's really weird cuz I dunno if I can picture us together...Hmm but yeah I dunno I think we have a lot of fun and stuff together but I don't know if he sees me the same way or not, maybe I'll talk to him or something... ANYWAYS Back to business Chace is back from Europe! He brought me my gift, he got me SO MUCH STUFF! He got me a Keychain, Chocolates from France and A shirt from Italy and a skirt! The skirt didn't fit, I'm not like the tiny french/italian girls, but the shirt fits and it's amazing! THANKS AGAIN CHACE! So yeah I dunno I didn't see very many people while I was there. But the people I did see were fun! so yeah I dunno...I got nothing, these are getting really short and boring, some day I'll write something cool, I promise! LOVE YOU ALL Good Day

      I'm starting to learn that no matter how bad things may be, there is always something waiting at the end for you, in my case, a lot of stuff has gone on in my life, but I know that in the end, whether it's tomorrow or 70 years from now, something good comes out of everything...A lot of stuff in my life has been going on, some of you may not know about a lot of it, some of you know all of it, some of you have no clue about any of it, but there are good things that come out of bad things...For Instance, when Ryan and I broke up and all that sit went down, I ALWAYS had my friends with me, they NEVER left my side, we went out and had an awesome time and I met more people, more people, the better the time right? This probably isn't makeing sense to any of you, but remember, THIS IS ERIKA DAWN LAVALLEE'S HEAD! But yeah...I dunno GOOD THINGS COME OUT OF BAD SHIT! I have a friend, she recently moved and her ex bf is being weird around her and his current bf...She keeps saying how lonely she is, but she knows, deep down inside, that she's always got all of us back here at home, and we will always be there for her! After all, what are friends for?  Also...Umm yeah...I'm in love with Tim Mcgraw, I was just dowloading songs of his today, they all have meaning and they're SO GOOD! lol and Keith Urban too, of course! Man, there's some amazing people out in this world...Like MY FRIENDS!! Here's more shout outs!  Kassie...You know it all girl, you always know what to say to cheer me up...Like who else does that!? AND you always get me hyper, no matter what mood I LOVE YOU SO MUCH and remember...IM CALLING YOU EVERY HOUR ON THE HOUR WHILE YOU'RE IN KELOWNA!! I'm gonna miss you so much, I'll get home you YOU WON'T BE THERE! YAY SEATBELTS!!!!!! lol yeah love ya HUN, SWEETIE, BABY! lol oh boy...P.S. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! PS...PS is cool lol oh the good times OH PS...YOU ARE JARED ROCK!  Ok...Heather... Heather, Heather, Heather...you're growing up so fast...lol I'm kidding, I'm so happy you got a bf FINALLY!!!

      Well, I love stories! They're the greatest...I haven't put any new ones in here, so I thought I should today since I'm doing a whole lotta nothing while Uncle Troy's camping with the kids and I'm here all by myself...  So I went back to GP...It was so much fun, I hung out with Kassie and Tyler and we all went for supper at Moxie's, mind you, that wasn't a good idea cuz me and Kassie aren't supposed to eat at resturaunts together, cuz last time we at at Moxie's, we were EVERYWHERE, the fries jumping in the ketchup...yeah, I think we embarassed people there...but yeah the food was good, the time was good, that waiter was creepy, he was friendly and all, but a little too friendly...THAT was creepy...So yeah I could still be up in GP but I'm not, stupid me decided to come home early...BAD ERIKA BAD! lol but yeah I dunno...  Things are pretty crazy these days, like I dunno, I've been so bored and whatnot, I don't know what to do with myself...it's weird...But I'm helping Uncle out so I'm alright...Maybe when I get back to babysitting again, I'll be ok cuz it'll be someting to do. Last night I was really bummed out, I don't know why, but I was, like I found out amazing news last night, and I was still all bummed out, just all ho hum...It's prolly cuz I hven't done anything fun in a few days when I KNOW I could be in GP having fun right? I'm hoping that was it...Umm yeah it's weird...MOOD SWINGS!  BUT Sorry to say, I have to go eat and go pee so I shall write more EXCITING things later.... Love you all! ERika
