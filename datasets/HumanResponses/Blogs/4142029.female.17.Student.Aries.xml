      i feel tired and exhausted and sore and everything dah. reg brought me the huka today. we have to fix it up, but its looking ready. im excited.  the cleaning sucked this morning, and i still have to dump all the trash, and i hate how when i mentioned it to my brother like...hey we should do the trash hes like you do it. i fucking cleaned the whole goddamn rest of the house. very gay. nonetheless, my mom could smell the beer, and i just lied and said it was 5 people. she isnt mad. but of course my brother implied that i had people over, just like he constantly implies to my mom that im a pothead and all this shit, and lots of times its more exaggerrated than it actually is. i find that very uncool of him.  lately ive been so pissed off about everything. my curfew, my parents, my work, my friends. the little things have been getting to me. i talked to annie about this...everyone has something or someone and i just have the summer. i dont have something to look forward to each day, but i get to hear everyones complaints about how their perfect relationships went wrong for an hour. not that im nessesarily complaining, i dont mind giving advice or hearing what happened, but you have to understand how it would get to me after a while. everyone has something and i really dont. especially someone. all my best friends have boyfriends and girlfriends and im stuck with noone, and not even someone to pick from. and the single ones are hooking up with people all the time.. im just not seeing such options for myself. i think id be lest pissed off if everyone else wasnt with someone. but i really have limited single friends in my position. it sucks. it pisses me off. ive been thinking that a lot. im just jealous that i cant find anyone. makes you feel like its never really gonna happen.  ill stop moping, im usually a happier person than i am right now.  angie is doing an article on teens who abuse aderol. shes quoting me. ha. cute.  i read esquire magazine today. the donald trump issue...hysterical. manda has introduced me to the funniest magazine ever. thanks bud  piece
