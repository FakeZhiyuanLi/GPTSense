      back on blogging after stopping for almost a month...form six is very tirin' always busy everyday....homework and all....basicly it all because now i`m like on my own teachers in school don`t spoon feed us like they use to anymore....was not so happy about to form six and had like a big thought about pursuing something else but well ...it wasn`t as bad as i expected it to be...ppl there are nice and all ....have pretty great classmates but one thing they are reallly LOUD ppl the class is 24/7 noisy....ahhh.....there is this two sitting at the back they just crap and crap and crap dana and latchman haiyoh always talking nonsense..although they aren`t talking about me but i just can`t help not listening and start laughing at their funny remarks.....a reall stand up comedy show happening at the back of my class....  got pn yip- the fashion misterress of SMKTS as my class teacher and bio teacher....everyday she comes in with like different outfits ....sometimes reallly weired ones and some intersting ones like the one she wore yesterday .....a yellow 3/4 shirt with a tie that has a print of a real human heart(her husband bought it for her) ...talk about the love of science....oh well shes my BIO teacher....  what hapened today??? well i had my first practical fo chemistry ...it was just simple titration but guess? what i screwed up ....it seems i took the wrong solutions, so sad i took the upper sixer punya solution which was oin the left and  has the same labelling like the lower six ones but i didn`t read the smaller print which has a 6A(upper six) and not 6B(lower six)  haiyoh i thought it would be the same ...hmm no wonder pn gowry told kean sheng ,siu fai and chai kun from the bio class to use the solution on the right side....and i was thinking why lah my reading all wrong i remembered doing every procedure rite.....anyways i wasn`t the only one, my other classsmates also took the wrong solutions...hehe....so with only 15 mins left after the teacher found out what was wrong with our readings ..i rushed like crazy ..by washing all my apparatus all over again....quickly went to get the right solutions and finally i manage to get the CORRECT readings this time ..hahah...thankfully i didn`t make any mistakes again..and well got kinda accurate readings...very similar to the teachers one..pheww...  tomorrow is my schools sports day but hehehe....going to ponteng it...lazzzzzzyy lar to go to school.....anyways i`m not taking part in any event also this year so why not i just catch up on my beauty sleep.....=P...
