      SAY IT AIN'T SO!!!!!  *Ahem*  Allow me a moment to gather some thoughts. This trade is probably not as big of a deal as I think it is. Is it? I'm confused. I just don't know what to think. I feel like I just lost a best friend.  I have sometimes been a fan of baseball, at times more, at times less. The first MLB game I ever went to was in Philadelphia, on a band trip. We saw the Phillies play...someone? I dunno, we did the wave and I took a close-up picture of my mother (which was my MO for a while, there's a whole page in one of our photo albums dedicated to my close-up shock pictures of people one Thanksgiving. My mother, as I recall, looks less than pleased in this particular shot. But I digress). My second MLB game was a wedding present from my first husband, when we lived in San Diego. We saw the Padres play the Cardinals, in 1998. Yes, Maguire hit a homer that night. And thusly, baseball fever gripped me for the first time, and held me tight until we were swept by the MFY.  And I thought we had a chance. PEH!  After that, I didn't really have much of a place in my life for sports. My father has never been a huge fan (although he rooted for the Mets in '86...), so sports weren't a huge part of my life. Then came Cliff, and the introduction to Red Sox baseball, a world I had only experienced from the outside, and even then, with trepidation.  It was that California-born, glove-adjusting, toe-tapping shortstop who entertained me, who threw on the run, who made catches I thought weren't possible, who warmed me to the taunts of my Yankee loving friends and co-workers, and made me proud to be a fan. Not to say I didn't warm to the rest of the team over time, because I did. But Nomar was the one who broke the ice with his boyish good looks, his athletic ability, and his predictibility in the box. I was disappointed in him during the ACLS, and I was sad for him over the winter during the now legendary A-Rod talks. I didn't want to see him go...I know, I know, he wasn't happy...If you love something, set it free.  I truly think that the only way he'll ever come back to Fenway is in a different uniform. Makes me sad, makes me hope for his future. This is, after all, the first BIG player I've seen leave since I've really been following.  I'll miss the toe-taps most of all though.

      Wheeeee. Boy, watching last night's game was about as fun as having ten hours of laser eye surgery with no anasthesia. As my husband bartended at the local somewhat seedy bowling alley bar, I sat by a video machine, foot up on the ice machine, waiting for a miracle. At one point, I looked over at Cliff and said, "Why do I even bother hoping?"   And that my friends, sums up this season in so so many ways. It makes me ill. I loved last years team, and I was glad and relived to see it come back this year largely&nbsp;unscathed. However, with my boy Nomar being Mr. Pouty Pete and Millar acting like a chuckle head, I hate myself for believing.   Let's review. I missed a large portion of the game while getting the little ones off to bed,&nbsp;checking in periodicilly to make sure all was well in the RSN. I saw Pedro getting his K's in the early innings, and I began thinking that this was, perhaps, the triumphant return. Hah. Well, while I wasn't watching (we have something like 6 TVs in our house, but only one in the living room, which my father usually keeps tuned to the Hammer and Nail channel, whose motto is "If They're Building, John's Watching.") the birds pecked away at our anemic defense, and the game was largely lost by that point.&nbsp;   Which leads me back to Ye Olde Seedie Sports Lounge. Between cigarettes, several glasses of water, and chatter, we watched a lost cause last night. I sat under the green fluorescent cast from the way-too-bright-for-a-hole-in-the-wall bar Rolling Rock sign (no one who frequents this establishment drinks Rolling Rock...Perhaps the college kids, but they don't return until next month) and cursed at Manny for being a flake. Just for a moment here, let me ramble. First, Johnny tries to catch the fly ball by running into the wall face first. Then, Manny catches the throw (?WHATTHEHELL???) that was intended for Bellhorn. As bad as the first game at Seattle was, this was somehow just that much more agonizing. They looked like the Three Stooges out there.   As I can tell, we're all ready down 3 runs in the day part of the day/night doubleheader. I wish I wasn't so sure that this series will be lost. My faith is running on fumes. Hope springs eternal, but man, this is brutal.   I'm out for now, hoping to be optimistic about the Sox tomorrow. Can't summon it up at all today.&nbsp;   .500 Ball tends to do that to a body.  &nbsp;

      Ah, the not-so-victorious return to Fenway tonight. Where the ghosts of the greats stand shoulder to shoulder with modern-day legends. So much chatter on the airwaves today and yesterday, so much speculation and fantasy trades being bantered about by sportscasters who I honestly think are little more than over grown frat boys who get paid to talk about sports all day.   Yesterday was the day of WaltherQuest '04. Walther is my oldest step-son and he just returned from West Point, where he was guarding the post for a year. He also has...Issues, like wanting to take a Glock to Iraq with him. Last I knew, the military  really  doesn't like it when soldiers bring their own firearms, but hey, whatever Walt. We drove relentlessly all over the state yesterday, in an attempt to get his car registered. I drove from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. We ate at Hooter's, and had a wonderful waitress even though I wondered how she could be so nice while being half-dressed.   God I'm only 27 but I'm turning into a prude!   But I digress. While on WaltherQuest, I spent my time trying to ignore&nbsp;Walt's prattling by listening to WEEI. There came a point when I wasn't sure which was worse, listening to the boy or listening to them.   Sheesh. Lighten up on Nomar, and put the onus where it squarely belongs--on Francoma. Seriously, watching Francoma manage is like listening to Clinton's 1996 State of the Union Address, in which I sat dumbfounded wondering if Clinton was talking about the same America I was living in. I wonder if Francoma is watching the same game the rest of us are, or if he's imagining some wonderful place full of rainbows and unicorns and a championship ring...Because outside his head, it's not happening the way he's been managing the team.   Truth is, it looked like our boys tried like hell to lose that game last night. Thankfully, Foulke didn't give it all away, and I could not have stomached another extra inning game. No way. This win one lose one stuff has got to stop. All this talk of trades, sure, yeah, whatever, but make something happen, shake these guys up and get them to play solid, great, inspiring baseball.   Yea Fenway. Go Sox.   I'm out.

      I can stand here today and tell you many things about myself, but this time of year, the most important thing is being a Red Sox fan. More specifically, I am a Nomar fan, but he is another topic all together. I am also obviously a female fan, and I will admit to having been "converted" only a few short years ago.   Prior to that, and my subsequent marriage to a die-hard Sox fan, I was unabashedly&nbsp; a Padres fan. I lived in San Deigo during the 98 World Series, and I already hated the Yankees.   Because of my husband, the night our youngest son was born, we were watching the game. Thusly, Daniel became the 3rd generation of men in his family to be literally born a fan.   I mostly gave my fandom lip service until last year (yeah, go ahead, call me a bandwagon jumper, to you I say a hearty whatever and keep reading), when Cliff and I were driving to the casino one night and listening to the&nbsp;Sox play the Yankees&nbsp;on AM radio. The signal kept fading in and out as we passed under power lines, and as the rolling hills and farms gave way to highway, we were steadily losing the game. I was praying, I was crying, and&nbsp;I knew at that moment why it wasn't a joke to my husband to say "games over," when we were up a few runs at the end of the 7th inning (like I had done a few weeks previous when we had been playing some other random team that I hadn't cared about at the time). Because ANYTHING could and would happen.   We went to Fenway last year, and seeing the players in the flesh was truly awesome, and the Wall was as magnificent as the Grand Canyon-It draws the eye up and over and dominates the place like a monolith. I got to touch it. And, since I hadn't become a vegetarian yet, I ate more than my share of Fenway franks. By the way, if you don't like being stuck in post-game traffic, go play some candlepin bowling. Did I mention the Sox were playing the Skankees? Did I mention that it was the time of my life?   This season has been a roller coaster, but I figure that I have a love of writing, and I am a hell of a lot more literate than some of those guys on WEEI and NESN. So if you can tolerate the game from the perspective of a lady in Connecticut who has three&nbsp;boys and an adoring and patient husband, then you're in luck and I'm your gal.   I'm out for now.

      I thought I had summed my thoughts on Nomar the other night, but I was wrong. I still haven't gotten over it. It still feels wrong, like when I got dumped 3 days before the prom. Now, reading articles on MSN about how welcome he feels in Chicago, how the fans are loving him already...it's like watching your ex-boyfriend date a really ugly broad and know that somehow he finds her more attractive than you.  Chicago is the bastard red-headed step-child of Boston, the absolute antithesis of a sister city. I wouldn't be able to say these things if I hadn't lived there, but I did, and therefore I have reason to bitch.   Anyhow...Let the new era for Red Sox baseball begin. Pray that we have eliminated dead wood. Put this behind us, move on. *sniffle* With that, I am done talking of Nomar forevermore. Amen.  I have to give Cabrera a hand for making a fantastic homerun in his first at bat. Way to go! Whee! Too bad we lost the game. I hate Red Sox road trips, they never turn out well at all. Tonight begins three-in-a-row with Tampa Bay. At this point, nothing is certain. All I know is that I continue to hope against all hope. August is August, and the Wild Card Race is on. May the best team win.  Feh.  Is it football season yet?
