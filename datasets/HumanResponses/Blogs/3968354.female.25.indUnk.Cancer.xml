      The ONLY thing I had to eat today was four small slices of pizza, which promptly made me very, very sick. Ugh.  Total lost for the week: 2.5 pounds. Go me!

      I've lost 1.5 pounds since yesterday, GO ME! And I did it all without counting calories or carbs or sugar grams or what the hell ever. I think Lisa and I both are more concerned with just generally developing healthier lifestyles, as opposed to following any kind of restrictive plan. IMO, any diet based on deprivation or strict rules is near impossible for the average person to follow for any prolonged period of time. It's far, far healthier and effective, I think, to slowly adjust your habits and choices to be better ones. This means that yes, it's okay to have the occasional bit of chocolate or a grilled cheese sandwich. That's a far cry from eating McDonald's every single day, after all.  That said, on to today's list: Breakfast: generously sized bowl of Fiber One with vanilla soy milk Lunch: 1/2 cup (measured before cooking) of brown rice Dinner: 6 small pancakes with fake butter spray (0 calories, 0 fat) and light pancake syrup.  1.5 liters of water, no snacks. Exercise: general chasing around a very active and friendly dog

      &nbsp; breaky - fruit toast (x2 slices) recess - Apricot Fruiche lunch - roast lamb and tomato sauce sandwich dinner - vegetable pie, hash brown  snacks - handful of Nestle Choc Melts drinks - 2litres of water, glass of shiraz, glass of milk, hot chocolate  exercise -&nbsp; SDEB - 40 mins    I am choosing to ignore our anonymous poster for several reasons. Mostly because they are so clueless that it would take me hours to explain all the ways in which they are wrong.     &nbsp;  Anyway, good news is that these past two weeks I have lost three kilograms.&nbsp; I am awesome!! :)    &nbsp;

      I'm going to be slightly less polite than Lisa in regards to the anonymous commenter. All bodies and metabolisms are different, and as such, there is no "one size fits all" approach to weight loss. The anonymous poster lacks certain vital information about me, specifically that I have a pre-existing medical condition that dictates what is and is not safe for me to eat.   So, if you don't think I should be eating any of the things that I am eating,  mind your own business  and please keep your opinionated venom to yourself. Your attitude is very pushy and judgmental, and I do not appreciate it one bit. Also, your assertment that I am "near despair" is a rather deluded bit of melodrama. I will be disabling comments on my posts as of now, because frankly, I don't need that kind of hostility.   Now, let's get on with it:   Breakfast: small banana  Lunch: Vegan boca-burger on a bun, with ketchup, tomato, and a slice of Kraft cheese.  Dinner: a medium-to-large bowl of Fiber One cereal with vanilla soy milk.   For a snack, I had some vanilla wafers with lowfat peanut butter.  If you don't like that, you can sod right the hell off.    I exercised today, a 30 minute aerobics tape.   I feel good today. Very good.    edited to include 1.5 liters of water, and a small slice of watermelon as an evening snack

      &nbsp; breaky - half bowl of Coco-pops w/ full cream milk recess - lady finger banana lunch - one tomato w/ melted (50% less fat) cheese on it dinner - roast lamb w/ steamed veggies (potato, pumpkin, corn, brocoli), buttered dinner roll.  After dinner I intend on drinking some wine and sharing in chocolate fondued fruit with my best chick friends.  SDEB - 20 minutes (because it's the only free time I had today).   &nbsp;  I would have liked to have ridden for longer today - believe it or not, I do actually like riding my Super Dooper Exercise Bike, but today was busy and stressful and I have friends coming for dinner very soon.     &nbsp;  In response to our anonymous poster - thanks for your comments - I would appreciate though, if you lost the attitude and were less forceful in your offering of advice.&nbsp; While I understand that those are your tried and true weightloss methods they don't appeal to me.&nbsp;I cannot speak for V (as this is a shared journal) but&nbsp;I do not wish to count calories or fat or any of that.&nbsp; I just want to gradually modify my diet to be healthier.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I like my exercise bike - and in case it isn't apparent, it is winter here and riding in cold, wind and rain doesn't appeal to me.&nbsp; *sigh* And just for the record a bowl of Coco-pops&nbsp; with full cream milk has 5 gms of fat, and 32gms of total carbohydrate, overall -&nbsp;200cals.&nbsp; I don't want ot be miserable, I like to eat and I want to be able to enjoy my snackfood and wines but also to be healthy as well.

      No food diary yesterday as my day was completely taken over by chaos, and I don't remember what I ate. Today, I've been back on slimfast (breakfast and dinner) just out of&nbsp;a complete unwillingness to actually cook anything. I did make a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, though, and had some vanilla wafers with peanut butter on them as a snack.  I am reformulating my entire plan of action. More on that tomorrow.

      Breakfast was an oatmeal bar. I like oatmeal bars. For lunch I had a few bits of cheese (muenster again) and some crackers. As a snack, I had an Almond Joy candy bar. And for dinner, six very small pancakes with calorie-free butter and light syrup.   Also, I drank a liter of water today. Goal achieved!  But, I've gained yet another half pound, bringing me up to 176. Okay, granted... perhaps I am eating a little more than I should be on a diet (cheese? I probably don't need cheese) but at worse, I would expect I just wouldn't lose any weight. I am not eating ANYTHING in massive quantities that would make me GAIN?? I am fed up.

       Man, I suck so badly at this. This is what I have eaten this weekend:     &nbsp;   yesterday   breaky - pancakes (as mentioned before)  lunch - left over pork (3 slices) half a tomato  dinner - Rogan Josh (lamb) on jasmine rice, w/ puppadums (x2) and a chunk of Naan bread accompanied by four or so (possibly more)margaritas   snacks - caramel slice (minus the base, I don't like the base), popcorn, soft drink (Solo), over 2 litres of water.    Today   breaky - rashers of bacon (x2), egg(x1), buttered toast (1 slice), hash brown (x1), fried tomato (x1/2),&nbsp;chocolate milk  lunch - cheeseburger, regular coke  dinner -&nbsp;Home made pizza (tomato, fetta, olives, cheese, oregano), crunchy herb bread (x 1 piece), Shiraz (x2 glasses), Irish Coffee (x1)  snacks - chocolate choc fudge ice cream   &nbsp;   I will try better tomorrow.&nbsp; I intend on going to the gym twice this week and in riding my SDEB everyday before work. Big goals, but achievable.&nbsp; It's a lame excuse I know but this week has been stressful and the last thing I wanted to do this weekend is think about food.&nbsp;. .     I have decided that I am going to be careful with what&nbsp;I eat but not to starve myself or anything and just try and increase my exercise majorly.    &nbsp;

      Screw this liquid diet bullshit. If I'm not losing weight on it, there is no point at all in starving myself. I've been miserable all week.  So today for breakfast I had a bowl of Fiber One cereal with vanilla soy milk. At around 3:00 my mom and I went to a place called Wade's for a late lunch, where I had some white rice, a VERY generous helping of mac & cheese, a yeast roll with butter, and some sweet potato souffle for dessert.   That was a lot of food, but I needed it after a week of starvation. Also, since I had such a massive meal so late in the afternoon, I probably won't have dinner at all. Maybe a light snack (something healthy) later.  As for exercise, I think 3 hours of brisk walking while pushing a shopping cart should count for something... or maybe not.  My goal next week is to go to the gym at least 3 times, optimally 4. And to drink at least a liter of water every day. Water, not tea or diet soda or juice.   Yeah. Cos I  have  to be a size 12 for my wedding. There is no other option.

      Okay so, yesterday... Slim-fast for breakfast and dinner, and a Lean Cuisine fettucine alfredo meal for lunch. I had a bit of baguette and butter with the pasta. Also, in the evening I had a small bit of really really good cheese (muenster, yum) and some saltine crackers as a snack.  As of yesterday&nbsp;I had lost a pound (down to 174.5) but as of this morning I am right back to where I started (175.5). Being as I've been flipping STARVING all week from the damn slim-fast,&nbsp;I am very frustrated and discouraged. If I'm not going to lose any weight, I might as well eat :(

          &nbsp;   I ned to add to yesterday's efforts - we had a games night with our friends, after I posted, during which time I snacked on: caramel slice (x2 pieces), more Cadbury's Chocolate, Honey Jumble biscuits, coke. Today isn't off to a fantastic start either. Though I am going for a walk now . mm does sex count as exercise? ...       &nbsp;     &nbsp;  breaky - pancakes w/ maple syrup, vanilla bean cofee      &nbsp;     &nbsp;

Be careful though V - don't overdo those SlimFast shakes as they can damage your metabolism and do nasty things to you if used for extended periods (or so I'm told).     &nbsp;   Exercise - Rode my SDEB today for a little bit.

      I have lost a half pound since Monday. I think it's a result of not feeling well, so it probably doesn't count.  Today for breakfast, I had another slim-fast. I had that for dinner as well. For lunch I had a cheese & vegetable sub sandwich and a small macadamia cookie. Not very virtuous, I know, but it was the first meal&nbsp;I was able to comfortably eat all week...  No exercise today either, since I still felt a bit like hell. If I am feeling normal tomorrow I will try to do one of my workout videos.   My goal for the coming week is to drink more water. I don't get nearly enough. I should be getting 2 liters a day. That sounds like a lot, so for now my goal will be 1 liter.&nbsp; Once I can manage that, I'll work my way up.

      Well, here's what I ate today. Not really sure how accurate this is, because I've been pretty sick for the past two or three days.  For breakfast I had a slim-fast shake. Mike probably will not like the idea of my trying a gimmicky diet.  For lunch, I was feeling a bit better and decided to tempt fate with some solid food. I had a frozen Lean Cuisine diet TV dinner, cheese cannelonis. I also had a small bit of french bread with lowfat butter.  Then I started feeling bad again. Solid food was maybe not a great idea.  I had a handful of saltine crackers as a snack, and also hoping they would settle my stomach.  For dinner, I had another slim-fast shake. I didn't really feel like eating but figured I could use the protein and vitamins in the slim-fast.  No exercise today, cos I felt pretty rough.

I am still hungry after all that food.&nbsp; Granted, they were all small portions but there was some serious carb action in there.&nbsp; I shouldn't be hungry.&nbsp; I think it is just because it is winter.     &nbsp;  I need to go and ride my SDEB (Super-dooper exercise bike).    &nbsp;  I'm so glad V is here !

      The wonderful Lisa has invited me to share her diet journal, because I'm trying to lose a bit of weight as well. I thought it might be easier if I tried doing it with a friend. It's really late right now and I've been sick all day, so I'm not going to try listing what I ate or did.   But I will say that on Monday (yesterday) I weighed 175.5 pounds, and would like to lose at least 15 of that before October. My long-term goal is 30 pounds. That would put me at a weight I feel healthy &amp; confident with. For comparison, right now I wear a size 16/18 (that's American sizing) and would prefer to be a 10/12 (or maybe an 8, oooh 8 would be nice).

See , this is how it is,   I like to eat.&nbsp; I really like to eat&nbsp;but sometimes it makes me randomly sick.&nbsp; The plan is to record what I eat to help me see what is making me sick.  &nbsp;  Plus,&nbsp;as per every unhappy girl, I'd like to be a few million kilos lighter, so this will help me with that too.&nbsp; Or something.     &nbsp;  It's just going to be food and stuff.&nbsp; Don't read it if that bores you.&nbsp; I wouldn't read it, except that I writing it.&nbsp; Sucks to me.    &nbsp;

And I feel bad because predominantly all I want to eat is chocolate, tomato and cheese and without these foods I wouldn't actually be eating much at all! Though, having said that - tomatoes and low fat cheese aren't the worst things I could be eating.           I didn't write yesterday because I was sick with a headache and didn't eat anything much except a bowl of rice.          I am losing weight slowly but I think I really need to do more exercise.

      I didn't update here for a few days because I was distracted by some family stuff. And I kind of began to realize that writing down everything I ate was maybe stressing me out a little bit. I was starting to obsess over it, trying to keep my calorie count extra-low, denying myself a lot of stuff.  Also, I was weighing myself every day, and that was getting frustrating. A person's weight is going to go up and down a bit regardless, and if I had an up day, even by a half pound, I felt bad about it.  So I'm going to try a different approach. Instead of reporting everything I eat, I'm going to set some ground rules for myself. I'll post two or three times a week with reports on whether I have been eating healthily or if I've slipped up. I'll report whether I'm getting my exercise (I haven't been). And I'll weigh in once a week, maybe twice.  My Rules:  1. No dairy.   2. No fried foods.   3. Minimum of 64 ounces of water per day.  4. One day a week, probably Saturday, I'll suspend my rules for a free day. Otherwise, I'll probably go crazy.  So that's that. Today I ate pretty healthy. I baked brownies and ate a couple of them (but they make my teeth hurt, so I won't eat any more). Also, I went to the gym and ran a mile.

      Brief downfall today. But hey, every once in a while we all need to eat something sinful and decadent that we are craving. It's not as if I do this every day, so I don't think it'll hold me back too much!  Breakfast: standard bowl of cereal (this is getting boring, tomorrow I might try something new)  lunch: a small patty of some soy stuff that pretends to be chicken, on a bun  dinner: a large serving of Hardee's (fast food) spicy fries. Bad for me, but sooo tasty! And given that I've averaged 600 calories a day for the past week, not likely to do me much harm.

We will get better at this though.  I'll admit that it is hard in wintertime when you're spending your days watching vids, staying warm.      Adding to which,  an excessively busy schedule last week meant I didn't achieve my gym goals so they are now this week's goals.  Meanwhile, I signed up for a netball comp today :)

      New plan this week - I'm quitting dairy. It's something that I've wanted to do for a long time, but as my diet is already so restricted (medically) I've been hesitant to restrict myself even more. But upon lots of reflection, I think that ethically, I need to avoid dairy as much as possible. I think I will still require cheesecake on special occasions ;)  So this week at the supermarket, I loaded up on soy-based dairy replacements. I've been drinking soy milk for a long time now. But this week I also got some soy yoghurt, and some soy cheese. In my experience, soy cheese tastes rather a lot like plastic... but I think I'm just going to have to learn to like it!  Today's food: Breakfast - A large bowl of fiber one with vanilla soy milk Lunch - no real lunch, but I had 1/2 a chocolate donut at the supermarket. It's a weekly ritual I share with my mom. Dinner - A lovely vegan frozen dinner made by the Gardenburger people. It's a new thing, and I was eager to try it. It was penne pasta with soy "meatballs" in marinara sauce. Very filling and delicious. I had a slice of bread with diet margarine along with it. I had a little bit left over, which my dog enthusiastically finished.  Saturday is kind of my "eat what I want" day, hence the donut. Also I had a sprite. But I am very happy with my weight loss so far this week! I monitor things on  urlLink this  diet software, and according to it, if I keep up what I've been doing, I should reach my goal right on schedule!
