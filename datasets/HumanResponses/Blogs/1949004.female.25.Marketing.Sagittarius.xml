      Today Has been a long day. I got off of work at 12:30 am and came straight home to work on MJJF projects. Didn't get to bed til around 3 am. Woke up at 7 and went back to bed for 2 hours and then jumped on the computer.  Hoping my proposal to BCA will be accepted and I can start work! PA!  Peace, Cre8tor

      Today. working on the same stuff. Club MJJF, the newsletter, club merchandise and hopefully my proposal will be accepted with BCA and I can get into my element again. I sorely miss the cre8tive flow I get in when deep in a project; and the mad money that comes with it. lol   I still get ideas in the middle of the night, as usual, so I don't dream that much, but they come out in the middle of the day. Kinda like daydreaming to music.  Diggin E.Badu's new album. Gonna get MJ's new album Number One's this coming week, prolly.  tip for life: try to live it with a new idea each day, pass on a smile, laugh with someone else and tell someone, anyone, u care about them.  Peace

      Hey Cre8te Blog.   Well it's been a while, but there are a lot of things to update u on.  Earlier this month MJJF was approached to work on a project that is HUGE! Through ROPA Promotions, Michael Jackson wented to have them build his web site, MJJSOURCE.COM. So, I was brought on to build the flash intro and work on some graphics.  Well needless to say I was excited, the excitement still hasn't hit me though. I think because I am too tired. lol Still I have taken on the challenge and we are doing very well. The site launches on March 1st and I CAN'T WAIT!! Simply because I'm ready to move on! When a project starts getting stale and aggressive, I loose my flow. I'll get back to you more on my progress.

      Hey C. Blog,   Today is another busy day. MJJSource launched well on monday but with a lot of heavy criticism, good and bad mostly from fans. Talk about a stressful day. Anyway, there is still work to be done as we are progressing for the better. Last night I worked straight through on the clubmjjf web site and set up 4 pages. Excited about that one. The Sense of Being web site is up and still have some changes to that one as well and then I will jump on an Author's web site for her books this coming week.  Tonight I will do double duty again and work on MJJSource heavily and some of the Club SSite. I am so exhausted. My eyes burn all the time and I barely get 5 hours of sleep, between working 9-6 and the about an hour to rest or so and then jump back on the projects til about 1 or 2 am the next morning.   I am doing my best and though I get burned out, there is always the feeling of isolation and lack of self completion with my work.   I easily do not like my work more and more lately. I don't even complete it 2/3 the way and I easily want to drop it or start all over again because I do not have direction or the sense the project will go right. I have become less optimistic in my art.  I am loosing my spark.  I need it back.  I have read some of Van Gogh's letters to his brother Theo and I kinda feel that way as he did...very unsure about myself in my work and that there is something more to convey in it and through it.  It's very frustrating at times, so much so that it makes one cry.   Well, at this point in my cre8tive life, I hope that this is a passing faze.   Peace

      Hey C Blog,  Again...stress is as stress does. I am now on the line with 4 projects in total. MJJS, CMJJF, Sense of Being and now a short web site for an author which I will start on this week.  MJJS: continue with flash update CMJJF: continue with building and luanching beta v1 site SOB: continue updating Author's web site: begin on framework this week   There are moments when all I want to do is find a quiet spot and just draw and meditate and just "be". Right now, all I can do is work in the moment and create. I had a nice weekend with friends on 3-6-04, playing mini golf and what not. It was cool but i was so tired afterwards, all I wanted to do was sleep and rest my right side which takes on all of my stress. I Had 3 anxiety attacks there with my friends and did my best to hide it.  I do not dream as much as I'd like to as I'm sacraficing everything just to work and make these projects come to life. But with those sacrafices I have lost my cre8tive spark. I do not have that lust to make what I wish from my heart. Everything comes in as black and white and exits as simple putty. I feel that I may break down and loose my flavor to cre8te the way I wish and I will fall off and not be able to get to the point where I enjoy it anymore. As of now, it's a stressful chore that I am only doing to make others happy and I barely find any happiness or satisfaction in it...the motions have become repetative. I feel I may even push friends and family away and if it becomes too much, I will have to push work away for a while so I can come back to life. Until I get these projects up to full speed and on track, I must continue to sacrafice for the good of cre8ting...but not for pleasure.  Peace

      Hey Blog,  "i live to find that passion inside that once burned me each time i laid my head down. on rotten patches now i walk and search for the way i onced walked where dreams inspired me to cre8te" yasmin   Started back on CMJJF last night and added a little more info and some more pages. Looking good so far. I need to add a few more interactive touches and hopefully we can launch this week, beta v1.  Jumped on romancingu.com web site layout with the author. Deadline is the 29th of this month. Not too hard of a project but it just takes time, which I don't have much of.   MJJS: right now I'm in love with P Machine. God it's so freaking cool! So many things are going to happen through MJJS, it's so hotness! *thanks Trish* I want to learn more about it and then learn how to maniuplate it so much more. It's gonna be fun!  SOB is coming along slowly but surely. Just a work in progress. Added the bios and fixed the links page./  ----in other news---- my mom i believe has vitiligo :0( i have anxiety attacks still. looking forward to getting to the beach and relaxing  ----  Peace, Yas

      Hey C Blog,  "sometimes it's like painting in the dark. i so wish i could see what my mind cre8tes. as it comes out on cavas, my hands feel the paint like brail to a blind person. i long to really see the colors that are given to me in dreams. one day i will see without wanting more and i shall be content with myself." -- me  ClubMJJF is twerking overtime right now. The deadline launch is sunday the 21 no shit!  I am dying to get back to my art though. Photography, painting, drawing and learning the guitar. I can't wait. I have to take care of some business though and then I can relax.  Senseofbeing.com is going well. Just have to set up their gallery and then they are done until I get on their logo branding.  Romancingu.com will be twerked on this week as well.  MJJSource. still have to fix the flash intro and then we will move on up. :0) That'll be fun and rewarding.   This weekend should be not as hectic.  I still have blank moments in cre8ting but it is better as of lately. Maybe just trying to live as it is and not make it what it should be really helps.  The beach is calling me. I love it.  Peace to better things, Yas

      Hey C Blog,  well well well. i have nothing too fancy to say right now. no special quotes. just feeling the moment, which is tired right now. cre8tive wise, i'm on a good path. extremely busy and never enough time.  the projects i am working on:  MJJSource :: My new forte of professional experience and cre8tive explosion of fun and new things. Plus it's the Mike to the Jackson!  MJJF :: Redoing everything. Not an easy task. I wish I had more hours in a day to work on everything and learn it all.  ClubMJJF :: let's just say it's a hot tea bag that has lost it's flava for me at the moment. But I continue to watch the steam pour off of it and I know I have to take it out of the pot sometime soon and taste it.  Sense of Being :: still updating. i should have the gallery up fully tonight. i updated everything else. once the gallery is up and then april pics go up. i will work on the logo again, which came out very nice by M.H :)  Romancing You :: simple site. done and it came out nice. congrats to the author and her success on her books. www.romancingyou.net in case you like romance novels :)  My new project is designing a logo for a baby botique that is being set up online.  I just sent in my proposal for it and now it's time to deliver. I will be working on it this week for drafts and next week for the final.  I know I know...too much work. I love working, but I have to be comfortable and in good surroundings. At this point in time, I am adjusting to my new surroundings and my limited techical capacities. It's a wonder I have been able to do what I am able to do. *thank god*  I do miss one thing while cre8ting though. I usually have tea or some liquidy substance to keep me flowing. But I am lacking in the music department. Usually it's Radiohead or something abstract. Nothing as of lately in music is inspiring...more or less it's all irritating. For now...I cre8te with my favorite cartoons, Futurama and Family guy in the late hours of the night.  Until next time...continue to cre8te!  Peace

      Hello C Blog,  Yesterday April 21st, 2004, MJ was indicted. Jan. 16th 2004, he was arraigned. November 27th 2003 he was arrested.  Makes my life look a lot less stressful.  Yet I still go on cre8ting. I will be there for my friends when my friends need me. Right now, they do!!  I finished the SOB.com gallery! Looks good! I will implement a Blogger of their own soon as well adn work on the logo later on. Then try to incorporate some flash in there.  I finished a task for MJJS. I will work on the rest of it this week and this weekend as well.  I plan to jump on the rest of the MJJF stuff as well this weekend, in strides. But I do want to start on the logo design for NinaBina Botique asap!  Cool ideas for it as well :0)  "gotta get away from the system, rules and the world today...XSCAPE!~" MJ  Peace, Y  --Music: nothing right now  --Mood: overwhelmed / a lil stressed --Inspriation: the future / chai tea hording this weekend  --Drink: Cranberry Juice --Food: Granola Bars

      Hello C Blog,  This is me now...here and ready to take on the world.  So what is my motivation? mmm...working! This weekend I will be taking on a new project learning p-machine and working closer with my staff on the SOURCE.  Next week will be pretty heavy with MJ headint to S.M so the press is already having a feild day.  I'm in the background mostly working on his site and doing other things as well to support. A lot of things most don't know about. Which is cool since I don't do what I do for the glory but for the purpose of supporting my "teacher" and the truth!  This weekend will be busy as I work on the logo for NinaBina, coding for the SOURCE and working on clubmjjf and the newsletter. Oh yeah and I plan to watch Kill Bill 1 and 2 with friends! lol  Who says you can't work and play at the same time.  Also I just want to support some of my best friends who are like family while they go through some things :) If they read this, I'm there!!   Peace and never stop cre8ting!! Yas  --Music: Damita Jo and Led Zepplin double disk --Mood: learning like a mofo and excercising energy --Inspriation: the future / chai tea hording this weekend / learning and movies --Drink: Greentea with honey --Food: Healthy shit!

      Hello C Blog,  What a busy mutha jumping week! Damn!  Tired and stressed and a little disappointed in some situations but what can I do mm?  Main design priority right now is creating a logo for Nina Bina. I have some cute pictures of the subject "Nina" so I will start drawing her out tonight in Vector and see what I come up with. This will be my first time attempting this so I assume it will work. 100% or nothing!!  MJJF stuff...well it's coming along. As usual, sometimes I wanna kick someone's ass. Right now I want to go to sleep.   The Source *shoot me please* lol Sometimes it feels like that.  Sense of Being. I just created a flyer for their show at the Kelsey Club and I will try a new design for their t-shirt  http://www.senseofbeing.com/flyer.jpg  Came out pretty good actually :0)  Cre8tepro.com --- hopefully I'll get an idea for a better logo this coming week and post it :0)  KILL BILL (both parts) is my new GENIUS FILM!! And it's only Q's 4th film! And the 1st soundtrack rocks!  Peace, Yas  --Music: Kill Bill Soundtrack  --Mood: Fucking tired!   --Inspriation: Sleeping and not worrying  --Drink: Crazy Raspberry Jamba Juice Drink --Food: Subway Turkey Wrap (healthy shit)

      Hello C Blog,  "When time is running out, why do we ask for more time, when usually we want it to run out? - So if you had more time, what would you do with it?"  My Fortune Cookie of the Week says:  "You will be awarded some great honor"  We'll see. I've had a few of them actually come true lately!  Today is a day...unlike any others. I worked a lot last night on about 4 projects. Still have more to do as usual. I hope I get promoted internally soon at my company.  Freelance Cre8ting: My client for NinaBina loved her logo!! I have to retouch up a few other things on it and then send the final with 4 other versions to her.  Sense of Being has a new Blogger which will launch tonight. Also their Gallery has been updated with new pics of April.  Funny, I was at work and one of the band members father's called me and wanted me to put up the MP3's of their work. It was totally unexpected! lol But the MP3's are up on the site, thanks to Mr. Parez sending them to me :0) I'll work more on the site during the week.  Tonight I will focus on my resume and portfolio and web site. I put up a crappy ass logo on the site last night. www.cre8tepro.com Just so people can go there for my contact info in case they want to get some work done :0) ClubMJJF (blah)  I know I need to work on more MJJF stuff but I'm burn the fuck out of it! I need to get inspired again. I almost rather work on MJJS stuff instead. In actuality, I'm Mike Jacked the fuck out! No offense of course...it's all work and no play....the dullness is setting in. It's like everyone else around me is all MJ MJ MJ and i'm like "so how is life?" *bang bang...he shot me down...bang bang, I hit the ground...bang bang, that awful sound...bang bang...my baby shot me down...*  Gorgeous outside! I love Cali weather. Freaking fires though are out here so i hope they burn out really soon and we don't have a bad fire season! Last year it was horrid! ugh! I'm in desperate Need of a Vacation! Las Vegas, Reno...anywhere else right now!

      Hello C Blog,  Well hot damn!  The logo is finished for NinaBina :0) They Absolutely Love it!!  urlLink NinaBina Boutique   Some of my best work yet, I must say so myself. Very happy at the results and so is the client and that matters the most.  -- SOB -- SenseofBeing's Diary is down and I don't know why. Blogger better get back to me!! They had a great show on the 8th and their fans want to read their feedback!!  -- MJJF -- And the Phoenix shall rise from the ashes (muahaahaha) New things planned for this ish. Sometimes I get so tired of it though. I think we have these ideas and then it's like let the magic begin and there is no magic wand to make it happen all at once.  Sometimes it gets really annoying and stressful...but that's how it usually goes. I can't wait until the magic does happen. Tired of waiting for the white rabbit to appear.  -- MJJS -- More updates coming soon. My task has been complete for a while now. But I have one lil thing bugging me I can't figure out.   -- Should be getting hired on finally at the company- Whoohoo- Looking to do some light traveling this year. Maybe vegas, reno, florida, palm springs, san francisco...anywhere actually.  We have a dog now in San Diego! Formally named "Frodo Baby" now called "Cookie". Sounds lucid to me, but i didn't name it. It's still a cuttie pie! Our bird Carlos F. Santana is already jealous of him! Lil spoiled Wanker!  --MJ-- pimping in the city :)  In the mean time...keep on cre8ting.  Peace, Yas  --Music: J5 (Jurassic 5) --Mood: Whatever freaking mood strikes me --Inspriation: The Weekend and taking pictures by the beach --Drink: Blended Chai (tropical passion -- thanks courtland for the addiction) --Food: Whatever is cheap and somewhat healthy

      Hey C Blog,  Did you ever feel like punching something so hard that you can almost feel your fists swell up before you even hit anything?  Today is one of those stressful cre8tive days with multiple projects. I'm going to explode. I'm very frustrated, sad, angry and not in the mood for much of anything today but working my stress off and eating pasta!  I can't wait til I get a promotion.  I will work on NinaBina first off cause that is a rep business first.  Then S.O.B cause they are a client as well.  Then MJJF stuff...right now I'm desperate need of a bullet to put in a 44 magnum. I've noticed as well that with each new project, I get more and more anxious and I find myself less interested in it each time around as well as MJ's music. Most of the time I am stressed with the meetings or projects and it shouldn't be that way at all.  It's becoming tainted fun -- on a scale of 1-10 right now I'd put working on the projects as a 4. -- but i do want to learn Mambo now.  Where does my portfolio come in? Psh, beats me! :> Peace I guess, Yas  --Music: Off The Freaking Wall - MJ(something fun and happy that i haven't listened to in ages. funny cause the last mj thing i listened to was HIStory cause I was pissed off too. lol ) --Mood: Pissed off and trying to get inspired --Inspriation: A break from working - and having fun in cre8ting --Drink: Te/Juice spiked with red wine --Food: Shrimp Pasta Dish

      Hello C Blog,  What's life like? No really, what is life like? I dunno, I'm trying to figure it out. :>)  Well today isn't as crazy as it was yesterday. There is some sanity in today, though it's just Thursday.  Projects are finally smoothing out and some will be reorganized totally.  Maybe Zen does really exist eh?  Thanks Blogger Support for finally getting back to me about my client. Their diary is back up at senseofbeing.blogspot.com  Remember I talked about my tainted fun? Well, the paint is wearing thin so after tonight, I will see where the direction will take me and go with it.  Projects:  * Nina-Bina.com is coming along well - did some more logo work :0) * S.O.B - Need to add more to the gallery. Blog is back up and dlow their songs!! Withered Away is hot hot hot!! ; * MJJF - getting back on track. I think everything will start falling back into place.  * I must work on my portfolio this weekend and divvy things out so I can turn it into work and hopefully they will bring me on as a designer.  Planning on head up to San Francisco for memorial day weekend.  i'll bring back some pictures. I want to build a branch on cre8tepro.com of just pictures i've taken over time. photography, my other passion :0)  Peace, Y  --Music: Jill Scott  --Mood: Mellow --Inspriation: Wind in my hair --Drink: Water with lemon --Food: KFC Twister with orange slice

      Hello C Blog,  When reality seems a little more bearable...so does life. ~ Me  Projects are kinda on prozac this week. Taking it really easy in the busy department. Restructure and reorganize.  I've been so busy that I almost feel guilty when I don't work.  - Learning Mambo is fun actually. I can't wait to start setting up the templates and getting ready to roll them out :0) - Trying to work on a new graphic technique with some images, but I can't seem to do it as of lately. Thinking too hard. - Photography -- taking it up again with digital camera! - MJJF: learning some cool out shit! - ClubMJJF: will be doing some cool out shit! - MJJS: cool out shit anytime lol   I have this horrid urge to strum my acoustic guitar out of tune lately to anything I hear. I need to buy a new one. There is a black one that I've seen at Guitar Center! I truly love it!  ** random thought -- need chai tea -- 3rd day without it **  Planning on going to San Francisco next weekend and chilling with a friend, so I'll be disconnected from cyberspace! (oh no, the world will end as i know it...well at least for 2 days) I can't wait to see N. Cali!! Get some air and take a hella lotta pictures!  Time to work on my website and portfolio. Trouble is, I'm such a prefectionist at my own work that I can't even get started. I see what I want, but I can never create it. That is very very very painful. So for now I have to back away let it be born on it's own. I even think of changing my blogger every day. It's like I crave constant change. Especially with scenery and art. I think that's why I like to move things around, even when I'm comfortable...I like some chaos and then I relish in the order I create when I fix it. (Van Gogh) Time to consult my ho-psychologist *durhhhh*  I had a good weekend. Chilled with friends. Lakers Game in LA with some good company, Sunday had lunch with college buddies and then home to hang out with the family and eat way more than I needed to!! *Drool...sweet potato pie* Life is good! Hopefully it will get better :0)  Wicked thought of the day: Wondering what it feels like to sky dive off of Mt. Capitan in Yosimite -- RUSHHHH!!!  That's all I have to spill so far! Until the next time C Blog...live and let live and then go cre8te!

      Hello C Blog,  Well didn't I say I felt like changing my blogger? I did, so what?  Shoot me ok! geesh!  I thought I'd try one of the standard templates. Seems pretty cool as I am a mellow sorta artist. But I love the chaos of the mind it brings!! *muhahahaaha* (so not devilish i promise) I think the next one I will incorporate my logo in it.  Absent without greentea 4th day! (the pain oh the pain)  Cre8tively I'm not sure what you'd even describe me as an artist. I was thinking about that today as I sat the duck pond by my job. Like, which pigeon would I be? A fat lazy one (hell no, cause i excercise), a stubby one who waits for food to drop in front of them, or one who goes and gets that big huge piece of bread?  I'm all over the place, but I like that I can't be pigeonedholed into one style or category. But I am a lil of everything :0) I like different styles, different flows, experimenting and even trying to understand something that I know I already don't understand. Like math! (bastard of an invention--lol)  But art progresses and so must the artist or it all will fall out of sync.   Projects:  NinaBina: update the logo look  MJJF: work on mambo and look at xoops CMJJF: design themes S.O.B: updating still --can't wait to launch new site Cre8tepro: on hold still   ---Learned something new today. Inspired by a teacher of mine (MJ)--- No matter what you do, how hard you try or even if you prepare people on what you plan to do...people would rather you not succeed and see you fall. Then no one will throw you a rope to really save you out of the quicksand without wanting something in return.  Sad but true.  *random thought: i love my mom, siblings and friends*  That's about it today Blog. ps: anxiety sucks ass, watch FAMILY GUY and FUTURAMA!!!

      Hello C Blog,  I love this song by Radiohead    urlLink Knives Out      I want you to know He's not coming back Look into my eyes I'm not coming back  So knives out Catch the mouse Don't look down Shove it in your mouth  If you'd been a dog They would have drowned you at birth  Look into my eyes It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth  So knives out Cook him up Squash his head Put him in the pot  I want you to know He's not coming back He's bloated and frozen Still there's no point in letting it go to waste  So knives out Catch the mouse Squash his head Put him in the pot   ---- It's still early. I will update later. This song gives me goosebumps. I can listen to it back to back to back to back...to back!   - jacked up on the ninabina logo. i forgot to make another small change. (greentea w/o -- long week without it) - too lonely today.  will rinse and repeat and go running later on today. go to see the ducks by the pond. chill in the shade, sit in the sun. swim so as not to sink.  ciao!  Peace, Yas

      Hey C Blog,  (thugged out cheba kitty    I was too lazy to update fully yesterday. Been online in meetings and working on mambo most of the day. Very exhuasting. If we can just get the template set up right, we'll be in business.  Gonna work on NinaBina logo and turn it in.  I need to vacate totally, my mind especially needs a break.  Almost a whole week without greentea or chai! Wow. this is a record!  Loving Lenny Kravitz's new cd "Baptized". I suggest picking it up! Reminds me of his work before "5". Kinda funky and retro! Favorite Track is "I don't want to be a star" cause I can play along a bit on my guitar and "sistamamalova"    Today I realized the value of my family and being humble. Appreciate what you have today and realize that you are blessed beyone comparisson no matter how much or little you have.  "Happiness isn't in a great white castle...it's in the snail shell you stepped on." ~~ Me  Can't wait to get going to San Francisco next weekend with a friend.  *vision is going...exhaustion setting in*  Crashing.

Always one more day to live as we all slowly die.  urlLink Scatterbrain   I'm walking out in a force ten gale. birds thrown around, bullets for hail. the roof is pulling off by its fingernails. your voice is rapping on my window sill  yesterday's headlines blown by the wind. yesterday's people end up scatterbrain. then any fool can easy pick a hole. (I only wish I could fall in) a moving target in a firing range.  somewhere I'm not scatterbrain. somewhere I'm not scatterbrain. lightning fuse powercut. scatterbrain  ----  There are days when you just feel like a song, and a song totally makes up your soul.

      Hello C Blog,  today has been a day of thoughts and questions. maybe someone else has the answers. if you read this and have answers to these questions, comment please.  - a world away...so where do i go?  - is it easier to please than appease?  - what do you do when you are not sure of what to do?  - how can you be found when you not sure of where you are?  - can anyone make sense of nonsense?  - is it all that important to be right?  - do you think about the person you told "i love you" to, after you said goodbye?  - if there is no one left to talk to, is talking to yourself considered talking to someone?  - will there ever be too many questions?  - will there never be enough answers?  - if you were really free of all burdens, what would you do?  - would life be worth living if you knew we had no purpose?  ----- One of my favorite lines from Rumi's "An Empty Garlic"  "Let yourself be silently drawn by the stronger pull of what you really love."

      Hey C Blog,  Three day weekend has come and gone. Didn't do anything. :0/  I'm back to work and there is nothing wrong with that. Third week and no greentea or chai...somehow I am still sane.  Getting back to work on MJJF stuff, which is cool. I have a busy week but I am gearing myself up to work on schedule. I don't want to move too fast or I'll crash.  Crashing can be good at times but not when your car doesn't have an airbag.   Nothing else to report from the feild...off to cre8te.

      Hello C Blog,  It's Sunday...early Sunday. Like 2:30 am Sunday! Niceee...but no greentea.  Cre8tive wise: Working on MJJF Stuff...that's about it for now. Nothing major hitting off.  "sometimes when the ones u care about are floating too far out, can you really jump in and save them, when all they have to do is stand up and walk on water?" ~me  "it's hard to see the sunset...when you really can't see at all" ~me  "even in the wind, strong arms of those u love can't protect u."~ me  "when they will never be the one u need...for someone else they will have to be." ~ me  "their rain, their pain...your hope, someone else's dream." ~me  Having a chill weekend so to speak. Went to Venice Beach and just walked the strip. Haven't been out there in a long time so it was cool to see some wessside culture. Going to see Dave Chappelle tonight! I can't wait!!  I'm Rick James Bitch!! :0) Loving the Chappelle!  Hung out with a few friends on Saturday afternoon and evening. It was a very funky and weird day and evening...just was like being stuck in a fish bowl and unsure of where to swim to.  Sunday should be a better day and I hope to get some much needed to complete work out of the way.  Here are a few pictures from the day by the beach.         --Music: Lenny Kravitz - Baptized --Mood: Unsure but waiting --Inspriation: Until Tomorrow --Drink: water --Food: fruit and veggies

      Hey C Blog,  Fucking LAKERS!! Blah!  Anyway...I had a nice weekend Blog. My youngest sister graduated from High School. She's the youngest in the family heading to college now. I'm out and done on both degrees but itching to get back into school. I'm very happy that she made it out and is very ambitious to continue her education. Congrats to lil poodha :0) My lil sqauter sister with the model looks and aggressive lil attitude!  I missed San Diego so it was nice to be back in my old stomping grounds, but I'm also glad that I have been able to move out. It feels good but I'm preparing for the next step.   The job is going good.  I'm planning on preparing for a new beginning...my own business. I'm inspired to start getting tips and advice on how to start up my own company in freelance multimedia and outsource myself better. I've done is slightly before but I'd like some help this time. Everyone has told me I CAN DO IT! I just think that it's about time with this new opportunity in my job. It seems to be going very well. This year was one of the most busiest years I've had so far making about 1000.00 in jobs. My fortune cookie told me, "Yes, DO IT With Confidence!" and "You will show what you are capable of."  It's time to make it happen.  Dave Chappelle was off the hook last Sunday! I'm a bigger fan now more than anything and TOTALLY in love with Southpark even more and Futurama and Family Guy! STEWY RULES!!  I'm preparing for the week so I'm back on chai this week! YUMM!  That's about it...and OH! My sister did this awesome picasso inspired painting. That shit is off the hook! I'm so inspired to get some acrylics and get going it's rediculous! I'll post a picture of it online this week!  MJJF - coming along well. Sense of Being is shut down. The band dropped my friend E.J from the band so I am no longer the webmaster. Bastards...but good luck to them~!  I'm still looking for more work :) So if you are looking for a easy to work with and very talented designer...I'm your cre8tor!  Peace, Yas

      I'm back again C Blog today.  Congrats to Casey!! First step out of high school, next step into adulthood!! :0) U go man...it's a great achievement and you'll truly remember it and treasure it. Now it's time to punch it for real! Time to celebrate for the summer!  Cre8tively --- I found this great site and it totally is my new heaven for me. HowDesign.com I have to post this cause it's so true!! ---- Has Your Creativity Gone on Strike? Try These "Block-Busters" by The Creative Group   After a good night's sleep, a few cups of coffee and an adequate amount of sugar, you're ready to tackle a new project. Unfortunately, after staring at the computer for an hour, you have no new ideas. You don't even have any old ideas, for that matter.   There are days when a blank screen is equivalent to a torture device for creative professionals. Fortunately, there are many tactics you can employ to maximize your creativity.   Try something new. If you have a creative block, take a break. Put the project aside and do something else you enjoy such as jogging or reading a book. A change of pace often provides a fresh perspective. One art director, for example, heads to a nearby driving range to hit some golf balls. Upon return to work, she finds herself re-energized.   Early to bed, early to rise. In a survey of top advertising executives by The Creative Group, two-thirds of respondents reported that they were most creative in the early hours. It may be especially difficult to greet the dawn when you're in a slump, but an early start ultimately can help you conquer it. If, however, you're not a morning person and never will be, schedule your most demanding work for times of peak creativity.   Get some clarity. If your creative block centers on a particular project, you could be unclear on what's required. Review your notes on the piece, or contact the client directly to discuss his or her objectives and expectations. A more detailed explanation of what's desired may provide just the nugget of information you need to trigger ideas.   Choose another angle. Sometimes a creative block can stem from an unworkable concept. In this event, consider approaching the project from a completely different perspective. For example, if you're designing a company Web site and the overall look and feel of it just isn't working, consider the project in a whole new light. Is there a possibility for a humorous approach? Can you build on the existing site and infuse some more excitement there? Explore others ideas, then pick one and run with it.   Seek inspiration. Nearly everyone has a certain setting in which they're most inspired. These places are fairly unique to the individual and can range from a museum to a secluded beach to a local art gallery. Try to seek out an environment that is meaningful to you and spend time relaxing there. Often, the right atmosphere is all you need.   Once you've broken through your barrier to creativity, take time to consider its cause. If you think stress is the cause of your block, it may be time for a vacation or a change of pace. Perhaps you need a new project to challenge you. Whatever the cause, by taking a break, you'll give yourself a chance to regroup and be back in business in no time.   --  So true in so many ways! Plus I found this geat site with tons more work from artists. I feel so puny now looking at it all!!       This one is KILLER!     oh man! i need to save up and get my paints and sketch material and get back to experimenting. just never enough time to do it all u know! so i gotta make time!! wozzzers! i'm floored and ready to twerk it back to my roots!

      Hello C Blog,     I am in a cre8tive unpeakness but I want to move my mind. (yes that does make sense to me) So many ideas and it's hard to get them in order to know where I want to start. Actually, strike that! I know where I want to start but I need to start it with so many ideas. First goal - working web site before MJ's B-Day!  Right now deadlines are close for MJJF project! Big Bang happening soon! MJJS - Gotta get back on that project in a day or so.   Looking for freelance work still. Maybe I need this 20% downtime to organize those ideas!  All is good...GREEN TEA IS GREAT! Everyday...drinking it is really amazing for the mind and body. I think that is why my mind is so stimulated. When I wasn't drinking it, I was so blan and dull in thoughts and dreams. Now I can combine both and get the most wicked ideas! Hence the half collage above there I created from "Picasso Inspired"  Looking forward to try out some new digital ideas and play around with some tutorials on blends and funky lil art spurts. Also head to SD for an art show next month for Ninthlink! Food, Art, Music and Culture! So sweet!  random thought *if you wondered how many times in the day you are really alone, would you really be happy you found that being alone is actually nice?*  Good thoughts: - hopefully seing a long time friend next month i've never met in person :0) - going to london this year - going anywhere this year  - cre8ting a piece i'm really happy with  - bringing back my six pack -- it's flat so need to tone it - find that spot on the beach where the earth isn't speaking - iPod and new computer this year!!  So far...anxiety and cre8tivity haven't met up this week!! whoohoo! let's keep them single a bit longer shall we? ;0)  Peace, Y

      Hey C Blog,  Thank God for Billie Holiday and Ray Charles! (may they sing together in heaven and tear up the place) They can put things back into perspective of life... forget the rock formations -- I think I can be happy coming back as a feather.  But not a dingy piegon feather... Yes, I may get wet and tossed around in the ocean and even pushed up against rocks...but somehow I end up back on shore, dried off by the sun and allowed to catch a breeze once more.  Cre8ting something I've realized is like a test in life...either you let it get you and knock you down, or you take the damn paint brush and get crazy with the canvas like your life depended on it. In other words, perfectionism is way overrated...  so why can i never stop going for it with my art and other ventures? :0/  *dang this greentea is kicking with the vanilla candles tonight*   btw: Happy Birthday Twisshy Poo! :0)  (weavalicious and awful  awfuls all up in there mmmkay)  There are no faces to blame when I am made to work harder, there is no one to kick when I do not live up to what is desired, there is no one to be upset at...but myself. There is some ultimate reason why I think like this...if you can tell me why, please send it in a fortune cookie lol  *Everything in it's right place...* Radiohead  What does not kill you makes you stronger right?  Wrong, it really fucks with your head and then you get drunk (or you want to get drunk but drink extra strong chai instead), go for a run by the beach, eat too much chocolate and lock yourself in a room bitting hard on your lip and having anxiety attacks while your right side freezes up.....  But then you get a little stronger and go on ... so yeah I'm not dead! wohooho! Van Gogh may have blew his brains out...but I'm nowhere near the end. This is the beginning...or maybe, just another pit stop before I get to the toll road on the freeway of someplace obscure enough to be on earth --- yes i wrote this while not intoxicated with anything but a little peace tonight.  *thank you Billie, Ray and MJ for bringing me back from under the water -- time to float back in the sky*  Work: MJJF MJJS (and no MJ is not all i work on...i do have a life lol) Cre8tePro website - will be my launch into freelancing myself out :)  Peace, Y

      Hey C Blog,  let's just say...i'm not in the mood for cre8ting right now. though i have to for a upcoming deadline.  the work i do seems to suck so why try anymore right? righttttt????  it's not my fault i do big projects on a laptop computer that is at least 3-4 years outdated, full to the max, that i don't have the propper lighting, the proper chair to work in or even an actual desk...so why keep trying when everyone thinks my shit sucks anyway. i don't believe in luck but actually making it happen...still trying to make things happen though they go so slow.  blah!  this isn't about criticism, it's about constantly trying and never really getting anything out of it. it's about the constant walk alone and no one seems to know when you have actually left. it's about being there and finally someone turns around and seens u but never really says anything to you.  am i starting to realize the fakness in it all or is the sense of doing something good for the hell of it, is being clouded by the artistic truth that things created for good, actually don't spawn good things? karma...i'm not sure it even realizes i exist - or it's playing tic tac toe and jumping over me.  i once asked a painter if she liked rejection. she replied: "are you kiding me? i can't stand it. i cry, get angry and want to throw tantrums! if i liked rejection, i wouldn't be human! you try painting something and having a stranger or even a friend says it sucks! knowing you spent hours doing it. knowing they'll never know how much you put into it. of course you will be hurt and of course they'll never know how hurt you really get."  yeah, they'll never know what it's like.  i realized wow, i can be a humanist cre8tor afterall and not feel guilty for letting my feelings get in the way.   this day...the artist does not feel appreciated, wanted or needed. i'm not sure...but i wonder if van gogh felt this way? if i cut off my index fingers, the main fingers i use to work with, would anyone notice?  think about that why don't u!!

      Hey C Blog,  very early for me to start chatting today...  just kinda pissed i can't go to magic mountain tomorrow with friends. i have too much to do this weekend in radiation central (aka - pc world). :0 oh well...not like the park is going anywhere but it would've been nice to go with some peeps and have a laugh or too.  hey, i still plan to save for london though! i really really do!  --anxiety met up with stress yesterday and the day before just a bit ~ i had spoken too soon this week-- i hope they don't morph into anything worse. gotta calm down. right side still hurts so i'm gonna just focus on work today at the office and not jump to my other projects while at work today. if i do, i'll restart the anxiety machine.  --i think fathers day (though it's past) upset me too cause i have disowned my father and i don't speak to him. i just recently saw him at my sisters graduation and i hadn't seen or spoken to him since last november. one part of me wants those old days to come back when i was knee high to a twin bed and he'd pick me up on his shoulders, or we'd dance to stevie wonder and i'd be on his feet dancing...those days seem like a past life now. he's a mental patient in a ward that he doesn't even know he's checked into (his own dillusions). to those kids with awesome fathers...don't take it for granted. that supportive hand on your shoulder never leaves you. i wish i had that. --  so here's to friday, the day before saturday, two days before next monday --- lets see what trouble i won't get into this weekend eh? (as if i ever do)  Work: same same .......work out a bit same  Music: Common Drink: Iced Green Tea Mood: somewhat eh...with a touch of anxiety Plans: who, me have plans? haahahaha  Peace, Yas

      Hey C Blog,  So like, it's really cloudy today. Why am I not sleepy, usually I am.  Greentea Biyotch! Perky all day and not even feeling a bit exhausted like usual.  Anyway, work wise, I'm swamped tonight. Get in and get to work and get to bed before 1 am. I still must watch my Futurama, Family Guy and A.T. Hunger Force then go to bed.   If you have an ephiany and then take it back, what does that mean? lol  --T got all of her gifts today! That's so sweet-- i want to go to the islands too lol  *someday*  Focused on finishing up MJJF and then MJJS and then hopefully get this bid on another freelance job. That'll be cool. Save from these jobs and get a computer which I so desperately need more than anything right now if I'm gonna make a living doing what I love do to.  If I couldn't cre8te, I think I truly might go insane...not that I'm that far from it as is. lol  *random thought: if there was no wind, how would clouds get around?*  Peace, Y

      Hey C Blog,  Did you ever wonder if some thoughts are too big for the world? To ahead of the time? That some souls are too beautiful for this earth? That some people, are Big Fish in small world? I think that about some people. Mostly about those that touch us in such a deep way that they are here for such a short time and accomplish powerful things to last forever.    Then I think about those that push the envelope and will always be a step further than the rest.  I wonder...sometimes I just wonder.  --More to cre8te. MJJF: Flash still in works -prolly a redo again tonight. Icons done  MJJS: need to get on the programming and talk to L and S on the backup stuff. *yikes mom, i'm building it from the ground up*  -- Nip Tuck~ Awesome episode! Can't wait for next week! --  Be in late tonight...gonna have fun tonight ;)  Peace, Y

Can I speak my piece?

      Hey C Blog,  MJJF Launched. Wooohoo. As always a work in progress. Happy to have it set off so nicely. I really learned a lot about the staff, about myself and about working online with a team. This is more than my degree taught me lol  *loving this french remix of YRMW, so mellow. got my incense going and chai tea...hotness*  Had a nice two day weekend, though I acutally had three days off, I still worked 2 days mostly. Still very exhausted. I can't get enough sleep and it makes me cranky and a bit irretable. I'm used to not sleeping when I'm working, but many years of doing that in my teens and in college and worn me down to really having anxiety attacks and flashes of light in my dreams...when I do dream that is. 4th of July was cool. Worked from about 10 am til about 4 pm and finally went to a friends house for a bbq and hang with friends. Ate a lot, walked it off and went to see fireworks at night on the beach. I enjoy my friends :0)  Enjoyed Saturday evening the most. Dinner, movie, nice company and a mudslide on the rocks! *1st hangover ever* ouch! lol  Well four day work week ahead. Gotta twerk it. I'm very exhausted though...still got a lot of work to do. Never finished.  *praying for a computer. gotta work to get one*  I hope I get enough sleep this week to enjoy the weekend. Though I had 3 days off, I didn't really have 3 days off at all.  *yawn*  ----poetry time----  Never enough  Sorry for not having enough time for not finishing it when i said i would Sorry for not being there when i had to work there wasn't enough time Sorry for being a little late when I said i'd be there on time and for falling asleep when I was too exhausted to stay awake to work. There wasn't enough time...  Sorry for not having enough hands, or ideas or solutions to the problems. Though I am trying...it's never enough Not even for me.  Sorry for holding out when I know I should speak on it. I'll make it up to you.  Sorry that I didn't make it up before. There wasn't enough time... there still isn't so I have to cut this short.  If there was more time I'd...  copyright - I.Y.S @ 7/5/04  ----  Peace, Y  music: Butterflies Remix featuring Eve drink: i need something strong - just water right now vibe: cre8ting in exhaustion mood: numb and calm thoughts: vacationing on a beach half naked with a cute bikini

      Hey C Blog,  my poetic flow has been coming back so i share it:  It Has Been On My Mind  Lately, There's nothing I'd rather think about  for the first time in a long time It's been on my mind.  When there are moments that I pause slowly It creeps in. Taking me to that higher High.  Lately, your smile gets me by. Even when I don't think you realize It's the simple things you do.  A captured kiss   in a stolen bliss Everything that makes you  wanting me to want you.  It has been, sinfully, lovingly, desirably on my mind.  ~Y 7-7-04 ------------  That's all for now. Really busy working and tired. Will work on MJJS tonight. MJJF store almost done.  Newsletter template this weekend hopefully.  ------  Greentea Boba on friday Ginger shrimp, rice and steamed veggies  ------  random thought - some people do the sickest shit for money or in the name of those who are suffering. geesh man!  god bless MJ!

      Hey C Blog,   Cre8ting right now at work on some web banners.  Only enjoying it with the grace of my Dr. Pepper (out of greentea til the afternoon), and listening to "Sweetback" to calm my tension.  Overtime is good, but really draining me this week. I've had to cut my hours with freelance projects, MJJS and MJJF.  Sometimes barely putting in 2-3 hours, cause by the time "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" goes off I'm so out of it.  Taking a week off from doing crunches...I need a mat cause my back is killing me now. But my abs are burning like fire! wohoo! getting my six pack back.   Anyway...everytime I go to the computer store I see the computers I need. It's such a challenge and a pain to work on a little laptop doing major projects.&nbsp;  What I wouldn't give for a Mac studio based set up or a bigger monitor and cordless keyboard and trackball mouse and pen pad! geesh!  Hopefully within a few months, I can get some of those things. If not, screw it and go for the polished black acoustic guitar! Time for some lessons!   I think I know what I want for my logo.      But I want to draw it like a vector. My theme will be cartoon upon reality.  Once I get this set up then I can put it on my site and put up samples. At least for now. I just need time. I may have a fellow artist draw it for me or I'll experiment myself. Whatever I can do to get going.  I just need to get my work up. It's been requested so much but I have nothing to show of my current work.   Anywhoo...Picture Time!  I enjoy photography. One of my past times. I love the beach and I'm starting off with beach pictures so I can get back to using natural light and shadows. I love sunsets, especially at the beach. It's so reflective of life and each day we take for granted, despite the trials and tribulations of everyday life. I hope I can get up to Santa B, next month to do that photo shoot I've been putting off. Take pics of the beach, city, towns, mountains and just random shots here and there.  But for now, the beach will do nicely, then I'll move onto taking pictures of people and light.               "!Ah! The beauty of real moments like these can never be replaced by strife." - Me ----------  *random thought*  What is the enigma of Michael Jackson? He's just a human being for god sakes! Chill out people!   *too much time twerking for M.*   I want to go visist my long lost sister in Reno ;0)! I need to get away! *after projects settle down...then maybe?*  Lets hope I can enjoy the weekend a bit and not put in 20 hours of work this weekend on freelance projects. I need rest or I'll get sicker. Dumb summer colds.   Peace,  Yas   music: Beastie Boys - To the 5 Boroughs food: health fruit bar mood: freaking tired need: vacation and computer want: iPod and guitar drink: (want spiked greentea) Dr. Pepper right now.

      Hey C Blog,  You know you are on the brink of a blow out, burn out or fry up concerning Mike Jack when you start laughing your ass off at Smooth Criminal.  I did that on Wednesday night when watching a movie with a friend. As much as I love to disect and be in "awe" of the direction and dancing in mike jack's short films, when my friend played the Short on her computer, I suddenly started laughing so hard at every little thing in the clip, I was literally crying and coughing from hysterics. Stuff like him bitting his lower lip, grabbing his crotch, the broadway style jumps and so forth...seriously was like me being from another planet watching this person do these jumps and moves like he was on crack! (not that he is).  Maybe it's the influx of working too much on his stuff and just standing at the edge really wanting someone to push me off the cliff, with a parachute. Then I can decide weather I want to get back up and do it again.  I realize there will be cool consequences from this project but right now, I feel like a repetative guitar riff in a Police song. You know the guitar riff, it seems to always pop up in every other song. It's like, someone please pull that guitar string off of Stewarts guitar! lol  Anywhoo...this is still one of the most challenging and demanding projects I've ever been apart of. I never thought I'd be doing this, but actually, as a kid (this was a semi-secret dream ... but without the stress attacks). Right now, my pictures of the beach keep me pretty calm when I run out of greentea. I think I'll have to burn some incense tonight to help me chill a bit as I work.  I've thought about writing a message in a bottle and tossing it into the sea with a queer message of  "Really, HELP ME! I'm trapped on an island in the USA. If you can find me, please send a plane fully stocked with Plum, Mandarine and Regular Greentea, Cheesecake, Velvetta Cheese, Crackers, Shrimp Sushi, Skittles, Snickers and plenty of tasteful and eclectiv DVD's. Make sure the plane has a PILOT to fly me to Bora Bora islands (a good one with a liveable space). From there I will send you $10 for your helpful services and write a book or a blog in your honor. Again, HELP ME! I'm really stranded. Sincerely - Deserted Soul."   I wonder what kind of response I'd get if any. lol   Right now, my hero is the sunset. Yes, I'm that lonely right now. But I like my own company, especially when I brush my teeth in the morning and dance to my own tooth brush song.   So thanks Mr. Obscure...maybe one day, we'll meet and I will honestly tell you how much of a challenge, experience, inspiration, confusing, sleepless,back aching pain...and honor...it is working for you.  It's not that bad...sometimes I can bare it enough to smile after I've done some of the work. hehe I wonder if Michelangleo felt this way when he was comissioned by the Pope Julius?

      Hey C Blog,  Woke up too early this morning by a mobile msg from a friend / coworker. Lovely morning message about editing graphics and the low quality. lmao! ah man...such is life for a designer Beautiful day today in So Cali. Got a blended Greentea w/o Boba this time. Yummers!  I had the weirdest dream. To sum it up simply  Africa, Neverland and too much candy, Driving to the mountains with a friend, water slids, Magic, Doritos, Cheese, Monsters, Holloween in the summer, Fireworks, Graphic design on a Mac in the middle of a forest, and far away images of people that were too blurry to see.   I woke up wondering "WTF" what that was all about. Didn't seem to have a meaning. I think that is what happens when one is just too tired and eats Doritos after 1 am.   Getting ready to work right now. Hopefully things will workout.  Found some cute pictures of family, friends and sunsets. I'll have to scan them on monday and post them...or if I have the chance, I'll hook up my scanner and get to it. Gotta clean up my computer. Poor lil laptop!  Anyway...of to worky work and maybe a movie this evening. Or the beach @ Sunset  * so tired *  Peace, Yas  Music: Van Hunt Food: no food today - just juices and veggies Drink: Blended Greetea (more greentea and water later) Mood: just is now and whatever Want: sleep Need: sleep on the beach

      Hey C Blog,  when you see things sometimes, that just don't seem fair, it makes you work harder to get what is deserved.  i work to the point of exhaustion and still...i see others just "get" things without working that hard or not working at all for them. i search, i do, i cre8te for better, i need and desire my dreams so badly. not just in material things, but for the future, for family.  i sacrafice loss of sleep sore back and right side in pain anxiety and planning thinking and trying to make it happen trying to network and make connections organizing and doing things the "right" way.  yet, i see others who don't do even half...yet - they "get" things.  i don't want to just "get" things.  i need to work for them i have to work for them i have to bust my ass for them i have to cause no one will just "give" it to me.  i see life sometimes...just as is others times, it irks me when things are the way they are. when there are those who had and still have nothing. my family, who is just barely making it myself, who has had some of the crummiest jobs, working in the rain and blistering heat just to make ends meet.  then, there are those who have "it" and don't see what they have in totality. i think, "gosh, can't you see what u have?"  but such is life some may never truly know what it's like to be so lucky. some may never truly know...  now i must work for what i need cause needing is much more rewarding than wanting.  --- this week shall be a long and busy week. lets hope i do not fall out from exhaustion again. no more playing around. i will probably missout on the weekend.  i may disappear for a while to concentrate on working and projects.  Peace, Y

      Hey C Blog,  today i had a cloud "cloud" meaning, i had an eye opening moment.  i'm so small. small in life small on earth small to everyone and everything else around me  we are nothing something has to move for us to actually make a spark.  without an action there cannot be a reaction  am i a reaction?  yes. i'm a reaction of a generation of a family a reaction of art of freedom of those that still struggle and will never stop a reaction of perfection going down an uncharted path i'm a reaction of truth and falsehoods of a drowned ego  i am a spark waiting to be born  ---- cool uh?  Peace, Y

      my right arm hurts a lot. a lot. a lot. so it will take at least 10 mins to write this and check fir errors. i gave blood yesterday and they jacked the needle in all over the place. in and out, side to side, back and forth! geesh! my arm is swollen and bruised and throbbing like the blob, and i'm still a bit tired and dragging. hopefully i won't be out of comission too long on projects. it really hurts to try and work. i have to put off tonight and possibly some of tomorrow if the swelling and pain doesn't stop. not like anyone cares anyway.  In other news...this graphic describes me for now. Not sure who the artist is...but i love the digi art.    go  urlLink here  to see the full image  i'm gonna see if i can finish up some work this weekend and maybe get out for a while. the beach again.  did i mention i hate sprint? well i do. buggers!  Peace, Y  food: nothing yet. - fasting half the day drink: blended green tea music: mos def - black on both sides mood: mm - waking up still

      Hey C Blog,  It's been a while I know. Sorry for the neglect. I've been mad busy lately. Barely any sleep and crunching hours at work as well as freelance stuff. I can't wait for MJJSource to bang out.  The exhaustion is making me ill actually. I'm lucky to get home and have the strength to fix dinner without dozing off. It doesn't work. I did about an hours worth of work in about 3 hours cause of my damn laptop being such a challenge and not having real working space. It takes longer to do things. Ugh!   *breathe*  Taxes. Fucking Government. Just give me what you owe me and we'll call it even. Straight up just dropped in the bucket with a freaking frog! blah!  2nd job interview. I Hope i get it. My current place is treating me well but i think the new job will be awesome. :0)  I've got someone sweet who is really doing right so far so good :0)  Anywhoo...just a quick update into the life of the silly things that are me!  Peace, Y  ps: GO SEE THE NOTEBOOK! WHAT A GREAT LOVE STORY! Happy early birthday HO!!!

       Happy Birthday Mom! I love you more than you'll ever know! I hope I can live up to you dream for me. I'll never make you anything less than proud!   It's been 3 years since I've been able to say this.  I have the official title of Graphic Designer once again at a company.  I had it once before when I was coming right out of college. I was laid off and from there struggeled for 2 years to try and make ends meet and make a life. Now I am starting back up again and looking forward to attaining what I have wanted for so long.  Here it is now. A dream stepping into reality! I am so thankful and blessed.  I can't thank my family and friends enough for their support! I love you guys all!!  Cre8tion is a wish, a dream or a reality. It's up to you to make it what you want it to be ~ Me  Peace, Yas  music: surprisingly MJ food: chicken salad (denny's) drink: Iced Tea mood: numb from excitement and work =0) weekend: wow, i think i'll be able to hang with friends after I treat my mom to a day at the spa!
