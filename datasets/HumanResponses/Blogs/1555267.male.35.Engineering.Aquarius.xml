        remove it!     I finally removed the key of my totalled car from my keyring tonight.  The bulky key had been sitting on my keyring so far just because I always found that the key is far inside of the key ring whenever I tried to remove it.  In order to remove it, I had to pull out all other keys first.  But I did it tonight.  Maybe we do the same way when we have to remove something settled at the bottom of our heart.  Just remove it.....now....

        Beautiful French wedding     It IS possible to marry a dead fiance in France (  urlLink Paris Journal: A Love That Transcends Death Is Blessed by the State  ).  How lovely it is....  I want to meet one of them and ask how they feel.  I wish I can feel their emotion and warm hearts.....

        Illusion....     I just hope the words, songs, and talks that I had with beautiful-minded friend were not an illusion.  It'll be really hard to admit that a warm feeling settled for a while in my heart was another illusion.....  Just hope that the sun doesn't rise so the images on the window doesn't go away.....

        time to say goodbye...     My Golf was totalled because of the accident happened last week.  It was quite unlucky to have theose airbags deployed.  I've got some comments from the vw.watercooled news group that some of the older VW models have quite sensitive airbag sensors.  I partly agree because the speed was quite slow.  The estimated cost for the airbags exceed the total value of my car so it's the time to say goodbye to this poor guy.  I also started a thread at the same group that asking "Am I doing right?".  Some says it's quite understandable for older vehicles but some says why don't I forget about the airbags and secure the seat belt instead.  No..no....I need airbags....  You can read a series of postings under my question on "rec.autos.makers.vw.watercooled", with a title "time to say goodbye to my A3"

I finally took this picture of street light this morning.  I've long been thinking about taking a picture of this light ....so, instead of torture me to take new stuff, I just decided to make myself get used to the past thoughts first.....

I got Gimp this morning so, now I can edit the picutres just like before... yipee!!!

        Got ready?   I'm trying to get ready for the conference in Seoul, Korea.  Now I have my presentation file sent to the conference organization so there's nothing left to do with the conference itself.  I just need to be familiar with my presentation :) and on board early Friday morning.  But....I still have lots of stuffs in my hand....about the journal paper, several model re-run, and the next step of the research....gee....  I'm planning to have my Dimage Xt during my trip so hopefully I can post some of nice pictures from Korea.

        Blue Sky     This is for a friend who missed the blue sky yesterday.  During I put this picture in the frame, a song from Pink Floyd just came to my mind.... a sad song that a part of their legendary album 'Wall'.  It starts with 'good bye...blue sky...good bye....'.  I don't know why I feel so sad when I look up the sky these days....  Oh, I just changed the size of the picture frame.  Now it is 307 by 410, vice versa.

        Digital version of Rolleiflex   Wow...... The Rolleiflex is one of my dream cameras since I saw this in my grandfather's workshop.  I think I was 10 years old but I just counldn't move my eye from the amazing dual lenz camera.  And today I found that Rollei unvealed it's new ditigal version of Rolleiflex (  urlLink RolleiFlex announces first ever twin-lens reflex digital camera : Digital Imaging : MobileMag  ).  I can't wait until it launches on the US market.  Now this beautiful guy is the first item of my wishlist.  Oh....what a sweet piece.  I think I'm gonna go to the grandfather's workshop during the visit on the fourth week of March.  I'll do.

        Feeling dizzy     Having no food this morning..... I felt a little bit dizzy.  Coffee just didn't helpful at all.....  Maybe the life itself is similar to this.  Whenever we feel lacking of something, we just pour some bad stuff again and again to our soul and make it really sick eventually.    I'm still searching for a 'button for help'.

        Conference schedule        The conference (  urlLink ICHWC 2004 - The International Conference on High-Impact Weather and Climate : Understanding, Prediction and Socio-Economic Consequences  ) schedule is now fixed and I'm going to give a presentation on March 24 at Seoul.  Actually the acceptance of the presentation was made long ago but the notice of the detailed conference schedule has been quite delayed.  It's going to be an important conference attendance in my life, I guess, because I'm supposed to defend my thesis at the end of this year.  I need some support for further research or a research position.

        snow again....     Yeah...it's snowing again.  I'm so happy to see and feel snow again in late April but it was not that cold and was very wet snow.  Oh, and there was a power outage this morning for an hour.  It brought me a very cozy and snowy morning time, which was so good.....    This is the first picture that I do some trick on any of my photo.  I really hate doing anything on the photos but I like this style....a little bit of bright color does give an accent on the calm b&w photo....

        BEAUTIFUL!!        Yes!! My new laptop has just arrived this morning.  I've been searching for a new one for a long time because current laptop is quite an old model and VERY heavy.  This beauty is one of the lightest model in the market ....I guess....  It's Fujitsu Lifebook P5020D.  Other considerations were IBM X series and Dell Inspiron 300m but this model is very attractive to me in terms of its connectivity.  It has memory card slots (CF and SD, I use SD only though), external display port (VGA, S-Video.... wow), DVD, etc.....  I love this machine....  Now I'm ready for writing the dissertation.....oh, boy.....

        No more snow     Yes, snow is almost gone as of today but I really want more snow.  This is the picture I took during the last snow bomb.  The beautiful flatiron is covered with snow and mist.  You can see the other flatiron picture on my Apr.7 blog below.  That's probably the 'normal' view these days.....

        More snow pictures...     This wonderful snow pile on the fence didn't last long.  After I took this, it just melted down (or just fell) less than a half hour.  Lucky...    The window of the famous Grusin Music Hall.  It's a part of the music building in CU.  I've been here in the building once for my friend's recitle but I really hope to be there on any Wednesday's jazz events.... sometime soon....

But there IS a bright side.  I found a efficient way of my interation in the code, so it'll take less computation time.  And this is the first b/w picture on my blog.  I LOVE b/w pictures but I just didn't try on my blog.  I remember the day I first bought a roll of ILFORD b/w film quite a while ago.  The pictures that I took with that films are sill some of my favorates....

Even though it was not from the place that have perfect view of the rocks, it was quite nice.  After I finish the 'almost-final' draft of my journal paper, I feel pretty cozy feeling with Norah Jones' music.  It is supposed to be crazy day until the end of this year before I defend my thesis, I'm feeling warm and cozy now....at least tonight.....

        PEACE you mean?    urlLink    Taken at Broadway, Boulder.  Marriage issues are on every newspaper these days.  As a presbyterian, I 'technically' oppose gay marriage but seems like I'm not the only one who have sympathy on this issue.  Last Sunday, Pastor Peter gave a very impressive sermon on this issue and you may want to read it ( urlLink First Presbyterian Church ).&nbsp; During the sermon, a girl just sitting in front of me with his father jotted down his sermon time to time especially when he mention some survay results or give strong opinion on the marriage issues.  It was so funny to see the worrisome father trying to peek at her note.  Oh, yeah, absolutely you want to know what your girl's thinking on this issue....I understand..... urlLink

        DIA     Clear sky at DIA.  Anything behind this photo?  It's really getting hot this week.    "Tyrannosaurus' back bone".  I'm having trouble to find best quality picture through my new laptop Fujitsu P5020D, which has 10.6inch wide screen.  Last time I posted the snow photo, I was really fooled by the crisp looking photo through my small display.  It'll take some time to fit myself into this machine.
