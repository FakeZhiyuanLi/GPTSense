       As an experienced computer engineer who is presently pursuing a bachelor degree in Communication Engineering at UMIST, Manchester, I am willing to join in an  IT Company.  I am interested in a position that will allow me to combine the talents I have developed in both computer Engineering and Communication Engineering along with my strong customer handling and communication skills.  However, as you can see from the attached resume, I have extensive experience in many related fields, and I always enjoy new challenges.  I feel that it is important for me to maintain a practical, real-world perspective while developing my academic abilities. I am proud of the fact that I have financed my entire education through scholarships and summer jobs related to my field of study.  This work experience has enhanced my appreciation for the education I am pursuing.  I find that I learn as much from my summer jobs as I do from my academic studies.  For example, during the summer of 2003, while working for PC INTERWORKS the system centre for FUJITSU SIEMENS COMPUTERS, Staffordshire I gained a great deal of practical experience in the field of electronic circuit logic and driver design, microprocessor assembling (most of them were INTEL processor starting Pentium 3 to Pentium 4) and 3COM wireless networking components.   I was dealing with UK and European Customer return of Fujitsu Siemens Computers and I was sorting them for possible problem and put them in an order for repairing and No Fault Found department. My work was based on customerâ€™s problem with the brand new computer and gives them the best and possible solution over phone, email or face to face. When I returned to University in the September last year and took Computing and communication engineering, I found that my experience with PC INTERWORKS had thoroughly prepared me for the subject.  I love to study and work on communication field every time and which was a passion to me from my childhood. I thoroughly enjoyed my jobs related with WTP, WTLA, WSP in PENTASOFT, Bangladesh. I even started talking the terms of Mobile communication in my everyday life.  I have a strong knowledge on Mac OS 10.2.2 Panther. And I am confident on sorting any problem of Mac whether it relates with software or hardware.  Having said all this, I realize that your first consideration in hiring an applicant must not be the potential educational experience your company can provide, but the skills and services the applicant has to offer.  I hope the experience and education described in my resume suggest how I might be of service to any company.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss with anybody how I might best assist any company in fulfilling its present corporate needs. I am looking forward to the employment opportunities in your company  for Full-Time in confidence with my education, experience, and interests.  You can reach me at the resume address or by phone at 07958619590 .
