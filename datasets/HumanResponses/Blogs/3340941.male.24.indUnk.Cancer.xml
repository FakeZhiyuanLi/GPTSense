       Ok jst got off the phone...was talkin to a frnd...not an old one but still a gud one...ne way she said " it jst made me think about how empty a life can be..." so now i'm up with my "BRAIN" doin over time...  The thing is i dunno how do u measure wot the hell do u hav in life...let's see how can u'r life go........  U'r born and u fall into line.....the only things u can do are either follow wot the ADULTS tell u or do the opposite...now not much of a choice, is it...Thus life can't b messured at this point ..........  U pick wot u wanna do with this bloody life u'll have to live (the whole damn thing!)......tht is usually (talkin abt percentages...) more or less broadly decided 4 u and u continue unless u have BALLS OF STEEL which i think u most probably don't.....so no question of life here either...  Hmmm now u r u'r own person......NOW THE QUESTION NEEDS TO BE TACKLED.......whn do u say life is full??? jst b coz u hav ppl directly involved with u'r life does it make u'r life full??? ok so as the society wanted u to u have the model famil pretty wife, gr8 kids the ppl arnd u will say u have a GR8 life hmmmm.......  but wot abt u??? now u r not livin for u'r self...... so u r basically making the life of u'r family NON-EMPTY....but they are not livin their life either so they are makin u'r life NON_EMPTY..but since none of u find u'r life FULL ne way u r SCREWED!!! both of u r livin EMPTY LIVES!!!  The other end....no family...every goddamn gadget and f*%#in cool thing u cud buy......hav all u need.....but every 1 says u'r life is empty may be u do too............  I dunno wot the rite choice is...may b i'll let u know in another 25 yrs may b u tell me, but i'd say touch as many lives as u can but create a void in theirs jst to try to fill u'rz IT WON'T WRK SO QUIT TRYIN TO TRY..................

       Hmmm so i'm back with my fascination.....ok this time it is something serious (yeah i talk abt serious things too). This thing has been bouncing around in the vaccant space between my ears........  I hope u don't but if u hav lost some one close to u or know some one who has...u mite relate to this....so teh deal is this person u know looses some one close.....and then is informed of the fact tht certain rites need to be performed, fair enuf.......  Bfore u can get to the rites u need to inform every on eu know of the death....ok agreed...now comes the shitty part......u can see ppl aproach the door with a very sad mood ( as expected) as soon as they see tht atleast 1 person can see them (mind u it doesn't matter if they can see the body of the departed) they strt cryin their heart out....but it is for all to see tht even Fardeen Khan cud've cried better....(i dunno if it is just me or ne 1 else also feels tht thr is a civilized way of lettin others know of u'r emotion...i'd preffer if u jst lemme know thn to give me a performance so i realise wot d hell do u want)  Although it is a loss, but the ppl directly affected by it need to brace for impact they are not supposed to look after people who are being looked after by all their SHUBH CHINTAKS.....the thing tht really pisses me off wud be if i dnt know u and u do know me (some how knew the person WE lost) and u come to me as my best frnd who is the only 1 who can console me ...BACK OFF...if i need u'r help i'll ask for it u wanna tell me u r sorry abt the loss TELL ME, dn't dump u'r baggage on me.....  in a few of the western countries it seems after the cremation, the lfe of the departed is celebrated sounds like a reasonable idea, but will have simillar issues too....  I dnt have ne thing against the rites and the things tht need to be done as per the religon wot i guess my point is KNOW tht u r feelin sorry for the dead and the dead must not jump out of the grave for the craving of stranglin u so tht U SHUT UP!!!

       Hmm wierd choice?? read on....ok, i'm tht kinda guy who gets fascinated by things tht u can't necessarily explain....all the unexplained stuff....i can sit for hours at a time jst staring at the tube watchin discovery air the unsolved things cases, things tht happened....  So, obviously Death also fascinates me!! nah i'm not a wierdo (ne way not tht big a wierdo ;)) it is jst tht i get bored of things pretty fast, ne thing....TV,muzik, ppl books..once the surprise element is gone it tastes bland to me...  This is exactly where death charms me...(read on read on i'm not losin it, yet)....See the very fact tht you will NEVER know wot did happen when some one died.....even if u do find out it will not be proved....If u find out first hand u can not tell ME so i'll never know!! Basically it is a secret all of us are bound to find out (assuming we remain concious after our respective deaths (HUH??)) but can not tell, atleast not to ne one living and the dead already know.....  If u into real muzik (read rock) do 1 thing switch off te lights, insert the floyd or coldplay cd.....shut u'r eyes....think of one thing, ne thing.....the moment u can not listen to the music ne longer.....i hope tht's how u'll feel when u r dead but then again....i won't know soon( hope not, if u already wanna kill me!!) and the day i do i wont be able to tell u..................prt II in a couple of days.....diff issue of death............be patient ;)

       					THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS    Hi, I am Rahul. I am studying in the final year of my B.Com. course in Mumbai. Unlike most of my friends I stay with my parents.....   However, there is one part of my routine i really do enjoy. The college not being too far away from home i usually take the 8:30 am    bus instead of the usually preffered local train. Most of the people at the bus stop are regulars and are quite friendly to each other.  		This morning was a bit special though, as i was waiting for the bus we had a new addition to the morning travellers.   This really pretty girl joined us at the stop. The attention of all the men was obviously now solely devoted towards her. Surprisingly,    the few women there were also looking at her. I thought of this as a great chance to make a new friend, and then my luck kicks in,   my bus arrives at the stop. On time for the first time in 3 months!!! Thanks a lot god. Anyway I shrug the disappointment and get on   the bus. As the bus starts to move I realise our new visitor did not join us. Now with nothing else to do I switch on my walkman and    retreat back to my own world, forgeting her.  		The bus stops at church gate, about two stops before my college. I look up for a second and THIS IS NOT    POSSIBLE she just climbed on to the bus. But how could she???? I just left her back at that stop. I muster enough courage to go    up to her and talk to her. As soon as i get up the bus comes to a screeching halt. What now?? I ask my self. I must have been   thinking out loud because someone replied the battery is dead. Everybody starts to get off and in the commotion I lose sight of her.   So it will remain as another unsolved mystery.  		Back to business, i have to get to the college or will be kicked out of the class. The only option to reach on time    will be to go by an autorikshaw. I wave to the first one in sight, but it already has someone in it. As the autorikshaw passes by i get    a glance of the passenger WHAT?? IT IS HER AGAIN!!!! This is it I start running behind the auto not seeing where I am going and before    I realise this gigantic bus is heading towards me. Over the sound of the traffic i hear a familiar voice......it is my mom. HUH?? " Rahul    get up or you will be late for college...." I get up bathed in sweat and out of breath....                             I think of telling my mom about it over breakfast but decide not to and start reading the newspaper. On the page    which has local news there is an article on a college girl who was run over by a bus near church gate. The article also has a picture    and it seems familliar.........

            Just think of a scenario, u live in a place where the day for you lasts for eight hours and for your next door neighbour it lasts for just 4 hours. once you get up from u'r sleep it is not necessary that it is sometime in the morning....u might not even get up at the same place where u slept last night....U'r next door neighbour has no recollection of u and u have no clue who he is either(u knew about his day coz i told u!!)      If u havn't guessed as yet, what i'm getting at is what if you were living in some one's dream. A parallel universe of sorts....where u have no control over what the hell is going on with u'r life the pretty gal who u met yesterday and married is no where to be seen and what really hurts is u can not even recollect her face.....the good part will be although u have no control over it u might end up driving a ferrari ENZO and beating schumacher at his own game.....       Coming back to the neighbour guy, you passed him (while lapping Mr schumi) and he was being fined for rash driving (in a maruti!!!) u saw him, u smiled.....but u never got a chance to really piss him off by repeatedly talking to him about it.....u had no idea wot u wanted to say to him jst the fact tht it would hav been fun.....       How annoying wud it be if you got up and had to go clean up the mess some guy made (most prob it wud b u who here on earth had screwed up.....again) and every bloody day u curse the guy how the hell can he be this stupid but the fact remains....HE IS THE 1 CONTROLING U!!!! so SHUT UP!! an dnow u r blanked again as u do not know who r we talkin about.....but it wud still be paradise coz u get to sleep for 16 Hrs a day...so pray to god(pick 1 every day) u r in the dreams of a workaholic and live for ANOTHER #%@*ed up day in PARADISE.....      Now herez the killer.....wot if the 16hrs u sleep and DREAM u r actually spawning another dream which is actually the life of u'r boss who is eventually screwing u on earth...tht's when u create the mess which u will end up cleaning the next 8 hours u get to wake up SO BEWARE DO NOT SLEEP!!

          I have quite a few "friends" who say they are atheists. Some of them i'm sure beleive it and for others it is jst another thing tht makes em cool. I myself do beleive in god but i actually loath the concept of religion.............  God, i beleive in.....why??? I like the concept that when i screw up BIG TIME i can still look up n say....OH god save me this time, i promise not to trouble u again....till the nxt time ;).....i also like to think that wot ever i do there is some one to watch my back...n actually never ask for ne thing from me.......so, basically i think i need ATLEAST 1 parasitic reln in my life n i'd preffer it to b some one i can't directly relate to.....a higher power.....the divine....who (i hope) will never get pissed at me, n whn some thing happens to me i can make him (or atleast try to...) feel guilty...one more thing i m almost sure tht god is either a surd or a negro....based on his sense of humor!!  Now the thing i hate.....Religion......originally i'm sure it was made as a rule book (hopefully with some logic) to guide the society (WHOAAA) ne how it is completly screwed up now.......i havn't studied ne religion in depth so i'll refrain from makin ne big time controversial statement.....but how the hell can u tell me tht i can eat a chicken but need to worship some other animals.....if the animals had a union (a la Dr Dolittle) they wud hav sued us by now for discrimination and species-ism!! the form in which religion is rite now is pretty shitty......i remember this incident naseerudin shah's (who is married to a hindu) son was refused admission in a school coz his father filled in INDIAN as his kid's religion n refused to fill in hindu or muslim......ne how u r entitled to u'r choice............  As is customary i'll end this piece with some lyrics ;) the beauty abt it is u can interpret it as u want.....this can also be a dedication frm u'r dad to u'r mom.....  FATBOY SLIM _____ PRAISE U  we've come a long, long, way together through the hard times, and the good i have to celebrate you baby i have to praise you like i should

       Last sunday i went on another one of my shoppin spreez....the only thing it includes is MUZIK..of the cdz tht i bought one was "ELEPHANT By THE WHITE STRIPES"....i was waitin fr a long time for this album to be released in india....and it finally arrived....the muzik is obviously gud.....but in the cd thr is a booklet (as is usually the case).....this post is completely frm tht and is not my creation.....The following is an explaination of the muzik...wot it is about and stuff....      This album is dedicated to , and is for, and is about the death of the sweetheart. In a social plane, impossible to exist, and in memories, past defeating present. We mourn the sweetheart's loss in a disgusting world of opportunistic lottery ticket holders, caring about nothing that is longterm, only the cheap thrill, the kick, and for the moment pleasure, the easy way out, the bragging rights and the trophy holding....The thirteen year old tattoo, the hard attitude, devil may care, dnt call u'r parents, drink, abuse, thnk only u'r self and blame every 1 else if u dnt get u'rs. Gone to the ether, gone to u'r mother's hope chest, buried in the boot of the rocker, the trunk of the car, and they get laughs, they get home late, they missed the rent, they forgot u'r money, they've won't be told they are wrong.      Burn baby burn, take the trash to the living room, laugh at the sweetheart, you and your friend can kill it if television's aim is bad, Break it hard or die, Hard or die. It keeps going, u r not wrong, keep going, dn't worry abou tit, what matters? U'r havin fun rite? break the rules, break them hard, help u'r self. Make u'r self at home, turn on the video games, dn't bother to contact, gorge u'r self, it's all here for u, take u'r sweet time,if u r confronted by it, blow it off and get paid quick. This is wot it is all about, and we r with u baby, take my bite as high support, take my argument as something that is my problem, u dn't need this, u need to please u'r self. The dream is alive and well, And we dnt wanna wake up from it. ETHICS, MORALS, SPIRITS, BREAKFAST CEREALS................  Ok so this mite be more relevant for americans but belive me WE R GETTIN THERE!!!

       Wierd one huh?? BIG DEAL u shud've expected that from me! ok i'am making an effort not to write in the SMS lingo.....now i don't remember how to spell so.......  So, u obviously read comics when u were young. When we think(whenever!!) abt a super hero we usually get an image of a geek who transforms into a caper having special powers and usually not knowing where is he supposed to wear his chaddiz(eng wala dsn't have the same ring to it!!)  Even if u grew up with the indian super heros u obviously know about SUPERMAN!!! So why superman?? i never thought of this till i saw KILL BILL vol 2.....(HUH??) ok in a conversation in the movie this fact comes to light:  What is the difference between Superman and all the other super heroes??(there mite be more who set the bill but i'm talkin abt the ones that come to mind immediately)  All the other super heroes are regular ppl who become their alter egos i.e. the superhero but super man has an alter ego who is a regular geek Clark kent..wierd huh???  wot if superman was sick n tired of being him self wot wud he be thinking??? the perfect ans is this song by a band called "Five for fighting" chk out the lyrics bit long but be patient!   I can’t stand to fly I’m not that naive I’m just out to find The better part of me  I’m more than a bird…I’m more than a plane More than some pretty face beside a train It’s not easy to be me  Wish that I could cry Fall upon my knees Find a way to lie About a home I’ll never see  It may sound absurd…but don’t be naive Even Heroes have the right to bleed I may be disturbed…but won’t you concede Even Heroes have the right to dream It’s not easy to be me  Up, up and away…away from me It’s all right…You can all sleep sound tonight I’m not crazy…or anything…  I can’t stand to fly I’m not that naive Men weren’t meant to ride With clouds between their knees  I’m only a man in a silly red sheet Digging for kryptonite on this one way street Only a man in a funny red sheet Looking for special things inside of me  inside of me ......  I’m only a man in a funny red sheet I’m only a man looking for my dream I’m only a man in a funny red sheet It’s not easy  It’s not easy to be me...  so who wud u rather be?????

       ok ok, this one is a bit early but WOT TO DO WE R LIKE THIS ONLY!!   Let's see, pick up u'r resume, most probably under the header HOBBIES u hav listenin to muzik!!! who doesn't me too.....and i take it seriously (seriously, i do!!) may be all u ppl who hav stayed in a hostl wud identify with this....listenin to the walkman 24/7 (well, almost).....ne way if u dn't listen to muzik on the walkman tht often....u mite wanna try it after readin this......  Since we hav already established tht u r a hostelite( logical approach!!) to head back home u must've taken a train.....and tht to sleeper....and now since the guy below u is snorin tht loud u do it again....wot, u ask?? PUT ON THE WALKMAN......TRAIN KI AAWAZ (eng wala did not hav the same ring to it!!) is a bit annoyin but it doesn't last....  Ok now herez the POINT (if u were lookin 4 one...) the sound did not last coz....pick up any song of u'r choice (nothin obscure ok!).........filter out all the other soundz except the BASS......now concentrate.....after a couple of secs when u get the beat......u'll fell u'v heard it b'fore!! TRY THIS....ne beat u hear can be thot of the sound the train made all u have to do is change the speed of the train or change u'r reservation ....WOT DO I MEAN??  If the beat is heavy, u r in a A/C compartment.....if it is a bit loud u r back to the sleeper......if it gets loder u r standing next to the train door!!! It suddenly becomes shrill.....the train jst passed a bridge.....tht was the pitch.....the speed of the beat is directly controlled by the speed of the train (hope u r not travellin by a mail or u'll lose all control ;) ) i think this is especially true for the new brand of muzik...the rmx, rehman's, mainstream rock...and the MONOTONOUS POP.....  no disrespect to ne onez creativity all i wanna say is all the beats in ne song when toned down a bit will fit in to one case of u on a train.....u decide u'r location and the speed of the trainn the TRAIN KI AAWAZ will no longer bug u...  it did wrk fr me so............  If u dnt belive me, jst give it a shot try it out....:: FOR BEST RESULTS USE A WALKMAN  ;)

       The other day i was watching "28 days later".........it raised quite a few questions in my head........herez one of them........The muvi had a scene when the lead actor is crossing the london bridge and there is absolutely no one there.........(not 1 soul..) So, wot is interestin is this.....  U get up one fine morning and there is no body there!! NAAAAH not like a disaster muvi...there was no epidemic jst tht frm this moment on you will never ever have any human contact, OK pretty predictable till now....the real question is wil u be happy or sad?? or will u hav a nervous break down??  Mind u i'm not talkin abt a guide to survival (a la "CASTAWAY") the simple question i'm askin u is if u have every thing u'd ever want, absolutely no human contact......wot will u do and wot will u'r reaction be??  Hmmmmm......i dunno, may be i'll be relived tht all the screw ups i did yesterday can now be overlooked, seriously i wud be relieved.....nothin to be done......nothin to be answerable about, but the problem is that my survival mechanism is HUMOR but i need a SUBJECT for the HUMOR to wrk........so now i need something else.......DIFFICULT  But whatever u'r reaction was for the question initially, i'm sure u'd agree to this: wotever u do from this moment on, will b for u.........not for a family or a frnd or u'r boss........no one!! it'll b for U tht might be the frst time in u'r life U did something for u'r self, not for ne body else and not asked for ne body elses opinion(unlike here ;))IT WUD BE FOR YOU!!! I think it will be worth it........ne way if u get too bored u can always KILL U'R SELF!!  (it wud no longer b a crime!!! :))

       Prerequisites to read on, u mst b crazy and/or know how to drive.   Ok, here goes....so, i'm jst another guy who luvzz gadget (yeah yeah i kno, u like it more thn me!!) ne way so the thing is i luv to drool over all these locomotives (ahem ahem) carz and bikes both included. If u like speed, and like to push u'r limits thn may be u'll agree, then again even if u don't WHO CAREZ?   So back to the point, You are cruising on the ring road (ne clear stretch of road for tht matter) in u'r car, with the muzik blasting(one of the only two advantages of a car)  and the only thing tht wud tell ya tht u are goin really fast and are about to shatter u'r own land speed record is tht boooooooring speedometer......  Take two, You are cruising on the ring road (ne clear stretch of road for tht matter) on u'r BIKE, i don't care which one coz u'r not racin against me, but u'r self.....now take a moment (FREEZE FRAME) if u r as mad as me u'r listenin to u'r walkman (marilyn manson or rammstein still tryin hard to make u deaf) u r hunched over u'r bike's tank (yyup jst like valentino rossi!!) and u jst need to add only 1km/h more to the speed to SHATTER the record but SHIT!! If u were in u'r car, this wud hav amounted to jst watchin the speedometer.....ne way the other major kick tht u get is u r "responsible" for u'r own life coz at 100-105 it jst doesn't matter how big a screw up u did, U WILL PAY!!!  The car had a roll cage and air bags (how boring) tht wud make u pay only for the car...so wot's the use u cud've let some one granny drive!! This remindzzz me of the muvi catch me if u can.....the conversation is......  de' caprio: What makes u so sure i wont run. Hanks: Coz there is no one chasin u!!  This is some thing pretty simmilar, whn u'r screw up will not make tht big a difference, u won't care.......but when u'r life is on the line, u better give it u'r best shot......so basically carz suk!!!  Ok the GYAN is over i think this wud sum it up.......  Life is like a video game (NFS NE ONE?), Loosin is not an option!!!  Hope u set a new recrd today headin bak home!!! gimme a call if u need some blood donations;)

       Back to death........few things about the present day that absolutely pisses me off....media taking sides instead of presenting the facts....ppl pretending to be from the main stream (read as moderates) irrespective of what they actually think when in there homes.....remixing of songs released as "tributes" (seperate blog on tht later)...  The recent episode in West Bengal led to a debate on capital punishment on a popular site(rediff).....I hav a different approach ....i think u can't let a rapist and murderer of a 14yr old kid get away with jst a single death...i DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS if it acts as a deterent to others or not this gut should get his dew...all the STARS gather for human rights...the fact of the matter is u hav absolutely no right to decide that the victim's rights were not as important coz he/she is dead....  If u hav lost some one close to you....u'll know how painful it is......but u r helpless coz u cnt blame ne one....now imagine the rage in u'r head n heart if u cud see the guy who did that....balls to his rights.....i wanna kill him.....as fat boy slim wud say "rite here, rite now"......  So my solution...even if tht guy was an animal he wud be shit scared when he knowz hez gonna be hanged on a certain day n date.....wot i say is this.....tell him the date only 2 weeks in advance....write a s/w(wot to do we r n d IT age) to randomly decide the date and then decide...if u wanna conduct the death on that day (by wotever means) if not.....cancel it....and decide for a date again.....this can be continued for a maximum of 14 yrz(the life sentence)......after which he'z gotta be hanged...  Twisted and sick?? yes that is the point after all!! make him beg for wot he never wished for but did to the victim........  if u hav time read John Grisham's The Chamber and u'll get wot i'm drivin at.....

       No pretentions....this has nothin to do with einstein's masterpiece...  I met Mr layman again ysterday (to b understood as cudn't sleeep so was TRYIN to think)....and the conversation went towards theories....and then obviously to relativity....  From a person's point of view....imagine u r bugged up with u'r shity life.....everything around u is movin too bloody fast u want to stop relax and take a break....wot do u feel like doin?? yeah thts rite SCREAM!!! but y??....bcoz when u scream really loud.....all u'r other senses won't b workin (not tht well ne way)...u won't b able to hear ne 1 else....so u will be alone..in a shell relatively speakin ;)..  The other way to look at relativity wud be this message tht i have on one of my T'z   Success is relative... the more the success...the more the relatives :)  Home work for d weekend..if u r a techy...or ne other trade wrkin in an office wid cubicles....U GOTTA TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO....

       I'm BACK.....i started readin The emperor's new mind by roger penrose(must read if u hav ne interest in maths and/or physics and/or computers).......ne how, i started the 3rd chapter and it has this HUGE pattern plastered over a couple of pages...and the author says this is maths HUH??? man u R crazy....  Ok, so as it turns outit was maths after all...abstract maths at that...but it turns out if u plot all the points that satisfy an equation(due to amnesia...cudn't remember) this pattern emmerges.....the point being this wierd patter which can be broken down to the scale of a building block is the result of a computer solving an equation....not interestin enuf??? read on......  Here is the BIG question........what make u say that you nd i are not the results of a comp solvin an equation..bouncer??? ok my thots....  BIG BANG.........=> the biggest comp u can imagine (may b a quantum wala!!!) strted                          solvin THE equation....  Building block.....=> The smallest particle discovered last or to be discovered yet (i                         lost count)  who started it all..=>   who cares for u it may be u'r respective god....or if u r an                             atheist...which quite a few of d ppl i kno are then may b the                            janitor of the place...he jst plugged in da m/c...    where am i goin......herez d deal......u r jst followin the rules defined by THE equation......no control over wot u r doin...when u think u r a rebel and are not following the rules may be u r just following the equation and are supposed to be tht way...........(MATRIX ishtyle)  ZOOM OUT..........the comp has jst strted solvin the eq and plottin the results....the millions of years old our universe is a couple of nano secs for the m/c...so STOP LIVIN IN U'R PERFECT WRLD AND LOOK OUTSIDE D WINDOW........puts things in perspective dsn't it......

       i don't know if you are a music buff to but i am a complete BUFF....the thing is for every thing that happens a song usually pops up in my head...so a couple of days ago when I read of the nafisa joseph's suicide.... a couple of songs popped up in my head...the first one was SUICIDE IS PAINLESS (title song of M*A*S*H)...nd the other one was adam sandler's KILL ME (from the wedding singer...)  why??? the first one for the obvious reasons the second one coz it is about a disgrunteled lover tryin to cope with the rejection....so wot went thru your head (after you thought poor girl obviously....... :confused: )  Suicide is painless --- jay jay jhonson  Through early morning fog I see The visions of the things to be The pains that are withheld from me I realise and I can see  Suicide is painless It brings on any changes But I can take or leave it if I please  The game of life is hard to play I’m gonna loose it anyway But losing cards are some days late So this is all I have to say  The sword of time will pierce our skin It doesn’t hurt when it begins But as it works it’s way on in The pain grows stronger watch it grin  A brave man once requested me To answer questions that I keep Is it to be or not to be And I reply oh why ask me ?  And you can do the same thing if you please   Kill me ----Adam sandler  [Spoken] Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the Cure a lot. [Sung]  You don't know how much I need you.  While you're around I don't feel blue. And when we kiss I know that you need me too. I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.  But it all was bullshit. It was a goddam joke. And when I think of you and I, I hope you fucking choke.  I hope you're glad with what you've done to me. I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy. You left me here all alone, tears running constantly.  Oh somebody kill me please,  somebody kill me plee-ase, I'm on my knees, pretty pretty please kill me. I want to die.  Put a bullet in my head.  [Spoken] Kid: You're going to the mental institution.  Ps: if u did not know M*A*S*H was ironically a comedy on the lives of army docs during the vietnam war!!!
