      i've been reading a great book the past week called 'making the corps' by thomas e ricks and he's made some really great points about the military and civilian life.  most of the stuff is great and i agree with it, like "there is, of course, much in american society today deserving of dismay."; "changes in society have helped widen the gap between it (society) and the military." and "american society has become more fragmented, more individualistc, and arguably less disciplined, with institutions such as church, family, and school wielding less influence."  i couldn't agree with that more.  i remember sitting in school in the 2nd grade saying the pledge of alligence.  you don't see that today.  you're lucky if you see an american flag inside any school now.  yeah you see them outside, but i don't remember seeing them inside when i was in highschool.  i think that the quote that i most agree with most is "starting in the mid-1960's, we have thrown away the values, morals, and standards that define traditional western culture.  in part, this has been driven by cultural radicals, people who hate our Judeo-christian culture.  dominant in the elite, espically in the universities, the media, and the entertainment industires (now the most powerful force in our culture and a source of endless degradation), the cultural radicals have successfully pushed an agenda of moral relativism, militant secularism, and sexual and social 'liberation.'  this agenda has slowly codified into a new ideology, usually known as 'multiculturalism' or 'political correctness,' that is in essence marzism translated from economic into social and cultural terms."  as far as political correctness goes, you never used to have to worry about that, but now, that's all you think about "will i offend someone with what i have to say?"  screw it, who cares, if they get butthurt, that's their problem.  people that take their freedom for granted and don't care about the military piss me off.  if it wasn't for the military and the thousands of people that died, you wouldn't be able to say what you want.  God bless the US and the military.

      well, i just found out what kind of friends i have out in california.  people like to use you and abuse you, and then when you're not needed/wanted they ditch you by the side of the road.  why are people like that?  don't they understand that in a place like we're in the only other people you have to support you who are close are your friends?  you would think that after 3 1/2 years in this place i would learn it's every man for himself, but i guess i always try to give people a chance.  someday i'll learn.  i miss the old highschool days when my best friend and myself wouldn't do anything with out eachother.  if we had a problem we'd talk about it, work it out, and in the end would end up closer than before the problem because we'd understand eachother better.  the fact that we're both Christians helps, but it shouldn't make that big of a difference.  who said, "my friends mean more to me than any adult.  they are my lifeblood and strength?"

      what would i do without my friends and family?  i think that i'm really blessed when it comes to family and friends.  i hear people talking about their families and how their parents don't get along or are divorced.  or that they don't have a good relationship with their parents.  my parents have shown me so much love and commitment over the years it's unbelievable.  i can remember when i was in school going through my rebellious time and wishing my parents would just leave me alone.  i wonder what would have happend if they had and not shown that they cared?  i know i wouldn't be the way i am today.  what about friends?  i've had my share of friends and i know who the ones are that will stick close to me no matter what happens in life and who i can count on in hard times.  i can tell you that that number is really small, but of the few that i can go to, they're the best.  i just got onto that line of thinking today after talking to one of them online.  no matter how long we don't talk for, when we do get back together and talk, it's like we never really were apart and we pick up where we left off.  the only thing that sucks is that we lived together for years, and now that we live in the US, we don't get to see eachother as often.  i'm lucky because one of my best friends is my brother as well.  the love and support he's shown me over the years when i've been down/in trouble is awsome.  i look around me and see how other people are, and i feel like yelling at them that they don't know what they're missing.  not that it would make a difference though, they're so caught up in furthing their own lives that they really don't care about the people around them.  it's sad to see.

      here i am after another 24 hrs of working at the brig.  i can't wait to get out of this place.  most of the time the work isn't too bad, but sometimes it really blows.  working 24 hrs and then having to pt isn't too much fun either.  most of the time people are tired and aren't really putting out 100% and the cpls end up yelling at people trying to get them to move faster, but today that didn't happen.  our senior cpl decided it was a good idea to work 24 hrs, and then run 11 miles.  i have to admit that the run was pretty motivating.  the joy of being a senior lcpl is that instead or running in the formation with everyone else i got to be a road guard and run at my own pace.  it was pretty motivating, but i'm dead tired.  got a lot done on the hill yesterday though.  got posted in squad bay 3 watching some stupid math class and decided that i should look up information on 4 year colleges.  it looks pretty promising with going to school in tx and being able to live in the dallas/ft worth area.  i even got to read a good quote: "freedom suppressed and again regained bites with keener fangs than freedom never endangered" - Cicero

      i just got done field daying my barracks.  i've got some boot cpls who think the world evolves around them and their rank.  what is it with people on power trips?  why is it every time you give someone an inch, they want a yard, or even better, a mile?  why can't people be happy with what they have?  i've been a lcpl for about 2 1/2 years and i really don't care.  yeah, it would be nice to be a cpl, but i'm happy with what i have.  rank isn't everything in life, and the amount of money you make isn't either.  why can't they understand the measure of a man isn't the position they think they hold in man's eyes, but the position they hold in God's eyes?

      why does everything in life have to be complicated?  work, friends, relationships with the opposite sex, it's all complicated.  sometimes you sit down and wish you life was simpler, like i do every night.  of course i wake up the next morning and plug myself back into the machine we all call life and burn through another day.  why, what's the point of it?  i don't even get the woman i loved in my life, i'm at the point in my job where i really don't care anymore what happens to me, and the people i call my closest friends live on the other side of the US.  the only constant in my life is God, and the relationship i have with Him is on loose ground.  of course, most of my problems can be changed by no one but myself, but most of the time the energy required to do the changing is no where to be found.  i can't say that about work though.  all my problems are caused by other people and their retardation.  screw 'em, only 6 months left and then i'm gone.  relationships, ha, don't even get me started on that one.  MOST relationships i've had end in broken pieces.

      when will things stop changing?  i had to change the address of my photo webpage, again, but i got to put new pictures up so that's good.  the brig had their first escape attempt yesterday, and of course my section had to be the ones working when it happend.  he was gone for about 2 hrs before we caught him.  that was a problem, but the bigger problem was that he got out, and when he did he had a weapon.  somehow he had a metal rod that he had sharppend on the end.  the only reason you make that sort of thing is if you intend to use it, and if there had only been one person who found him, i think that someone might not have been coming home this morning when we got off.  all the higherups said we did a great job, so that's good too.  now all they need to do is let me go on leave so i can burn some leave days and not have to sell them back to the military.  why they closed off people taking leave is beyond me.  they say that we don't have the bodies, but yesterday we had plenty, and that was with 3 gone TAD.  why is it every time i turn around security is getting screwed?  we work the longest, hardest hours of any marine up on the hill and we always end up getting the short end of the stick.  why?  only 5 more months, 5 more.  please God let the end come soon.

      i love this place and all the politics that come with it.  i finally got myself on the range, but it took too much effort for it to happen.  it finally came down to me requesting mast over such a small thing as the range.  it's amazing what happens when you say those 2 words, request mast.  things start to happen when you bust them out.  what's great is that people always say to use your chain of command and do things the way they're supposed to be done, but when you do nothing happens.  my ssgt got all pissed about that.  he came to me and started yelling at me because i didn't use my chain of command.  what's great is that i told him for the past 2 months i have been, but it failed me so i took matters in my own hand.  i told him if people when us to use the chain of command, then when we do they have to pass the word onto the higher-ups.  i also told him that if he wants to get pissed then he should go and talk to my cpl (also my squad leader) and ask him why he never passed the word up the chain.  i'm not complaining, don't get me wrong on that end, all i cared about was getting on the range, and i am.  it's wierd, for the past week or so there's been nothing going on that really upsets me.  hope it stays that way.  ha, what am i saying, this is the military.

      i just got done with the last pft i'll ever take in the marine corps and i feel great.  5 more months and i'm outta here.  one major thing is done, 1000 other to do between now and oct. for once in my life i really don't have anything on my mind that i feel i need to put into words.  that's wierd for me because i usally have something to say about whatever is going on, but right now, at this exact moment, i'm drawing a blank.  i'm happy, talking to friends, life is good.

      finally things are starting to go well.  the leave i've waited so long to get was finally approved yesterday, only 8 days prior to going on leave, but it was still approved.  the only bad thing is that tomorrow morning there's a commanding general inspection, and i'm in it.  it wouldn't have to be so bad if i was in the pft, but i'm in the alpha inspection so that sucks.  what's worse is one of my cpls came up to my room and asked if my room mate's alpha's were ready because his house got robbed and he wasn't really in the mood for the inspection, so we ended up getting another guy to fill his spot.  oh well, sucks to be the guy that robbed the place.

      i've had 2 thoughts on my mind for awhile; 1) it's hard to trust again when you've been hurt in the past and 2) we can learn so much from our parents.  i've been thinking about my past and everything that i've done and some of it i'm not proud of, but i know that i've been forgiven.  some of it i knew what i was doing at the time, but did it anyway without regard for people who were in my life at that time or who would come into my life in the future.  some of it was done to me.  do i feel bitter or hold grudges againts the people responsible, no, that wouldn't make sence in regards to what i believe.  what i regret the most is that it made me unconsciously put up a wall so it wouldn't happen again.  i've come to realize that taking that wall down is extremely hard when it's been up for so long.  having to relearn all the things that i've forgotten to do is very important to me, and as hard as i try, it's not getting any easier.  i understand in a relationship people are concerned with the girl getting hurt because usally it's the guy who screws things up and hurts the girl, but every once and awhile, it's the guy who gets hurt.  after showing who i was and the 'me' to someone, after all my feelings were laid out, it all came crashing down.  it's hard to learn trust again, but it's coming back.  i just hope that my future wife and i can be like my parents.  the way they trust one another is amazing.  watching them in their every day life and the way they act around eachother is a great example.  of course my marrage will be my own, but they provide the greatest example i've ever seen.

      so i'm back.  i really don't care about this stupid blogger anymore, i just use it to talk to friends/family who i can't get a hold of at any time i want to.  i've started to put pictures up on a webpage, but because i'm not willing to pay 5 dollars a month i can only put 1 up a day.  it's going to take a few weeks to get the all up.  it's coming, just wait.
