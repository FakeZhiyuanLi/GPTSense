       Monday morning.... Thoughts for the day: * How does one thrive in challenges? * What does it take to rise back from a defeat? * Do serious activities stop being fun and enjoyable at some stage? * How much is too much?

       Read lots of interesting articles/references on the web recently.  Mainly gnome related: * gnome 2.6 reviews ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) * State and future of gnome ( urlLink here ) * More on future outlook of Gnome ( urlLink here ) * Mono ( urlLink go mono! ) * debate on the language choice for the desktop

        Weekend...  Was good. Saw 'Hum Tum' on Friday (took tickets in black after a long time, in fact so long that I don't remember when I did that last!) Was worth it. Good movie, great company :) Caught another movie ('Yuva') on Saturday. Proper  masaala  movie according to me. Gals swooning over Abhishek Bachchan all over the place.... Had a nice shower to end the day.... no not at my home, on the road. Its pouring in mid-summer at Bangalore. Lucky me.   Fedora & Gnome 2.6  RPM upgrades are not as smooth as I wish they were. I need to read up more on what the issues are with the same. Am reading an increasing the opinion on the mailing lists that a clean install is the best way to go with Fedora. I think I'll try that next time at home. (Fedora Core 2 ISO download is still not complete, so there is some time for that). For now, however, I'm stuck at office with all my MIME-associations lost after an RPM upgrade to Gnome 2.6. On the brighter side, I got to read the  urlLink shared-mime-info-spec  which is good reading, and which I would not have seen unless I encountered  urlLink these problems .  Meanwhile, a very heartening  urlLink post  on the mailing list which says I can continue to dual-boot after upgrade to FC2 without _any_ issues if I just take some care. I don't use XP so much these days, but my gaming is almost entirely on XP, and for that I can't remove it totally :)

       This is my first post from BloGTK. It got a decent review  urlLink here  and so I wanted to try it out. My opinion: * The front-end is good (HIG compliant as far as I can make out). * Back-end seems to use XML RPC, while blogger is moving towards ATOM. So that may be an issue. Not right now, though. * There are shortcuts to edit HTML without writing the markup yourself. That's a plus. * The line feeds are not coming in the preview whenever I press an 'Enter'. If they don't show up in the final blog, then it'll be sad.  Lets see how this goes :)

       Serendipity  Ah.... what a pleasant surprise to start my day. Read on PlanetGnome that blogger has new templates available. Came over to check out the same. Got a new GMail account in the process :) .... AND .... I must say the new templates are a great piece of work! Kudos to the creators!! I'm very impressed with the same.   Blogging (and news aggregators) are really innovative means of having a presence on the net and being in touch with folks you'd like to hear from. Seen several offerings over the last fortnight, out of which I particularly liked: pLog, pyBlosxom and WordPress. I was beginning to feel Blogger is not quite there, but guess what.... I was wrong. The new look of the site is a big plus. I'm here to stay!

        Hectic days.  Looks like they are here to stay. Its both good and bad. The good: I am really getting to learn more on my job. Also, I'm managing my time better to get the optimum results out early rather than relax and do it. The bad: I have personal commitments that may take a hit and my real estate hunt is worrying me no end when I can't give it the right time slice of my working day. Its bad to be flooded with work when you need to be out of office early for some other reason.... but that's the way life goes these days. Things are moving along though, and we should be in some shape to freeze matters soon.... so I hope. For the moment, hanging in here. :)  Ah.... My compilation must have finished. Time to close this note. Ciao.

        Back again  Its been a long while since I posted anything out here. Its good to be back :)  Meanwhile, trip to Kamath's wedding was quite good. We did not see much of the wedding though. Am still waiting to see the Chitradurga pics taken by friends' cameras. Its so easy to be trigger-happy with a digital cam :)   More soon.

        Lazy weekend.  Spent whole time at home or at my desk at office reading up on stuff pertaining to managing finances. I don't feel quite rested though.... One thing is certain, it feels good to dream of building our own home. As expected, its the journey from the dreams to making it a reality that is a little exhausting ;)  Happy Father's Day to my Dad and Father-In-Law-to-be :) And.... congratulations to my little sis (Nupur) who'll be graduating next week!!

Quote of the day  (Read it  urlLink here ): Success:  To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.

        Life....   Okies. Its been a nice weekend and its a very hectic Monday to start the week (Its almost time to go home now). My uncle (Rakesh Mama) was here for the weekend and we had a pretty good time with him. I realize at times like these that my life as a bachelor is not what my parents or elders would feel remotely comfortable with. Half the things in my room are in a mess (quickly dumped below the bed to give some area to walk on ;) and the kitchen hardly contains enough stuff to make tea (coffee is not the house, sorry). Its a tough task to find more than 2 cups which are of the same design or size and the windows have enough dust on them to make them look naturally coloured brown..... amazing how these things don't attract your attention on a normal 'non-parent-association' working day since I and my room mate don't usually cook at home anyways and by the time I enter home its dark enough not to notice any weird colours in any part of the room under the tubelight. I'm pretty certain that after seeing my place all elders in my family will thank God that I'm getting married soon.  But I digress, coming back to the weekend.... On Saturday, Mama and both of us (I and Vrushali) walked around a whole lot of Bangalore and were driven around (in an auto-rickshaw) even more than that. The matter of search: real estate. The search was an eye-opener for the most parts since the property rates turned out to be even higher than poor-old-me thought they were. But it was better to find that out now than later. We stopped only for a brief lunch throughout the hops. The high point was the wonderful dinner to end the day....  Sunday morning, I continued to display my love for badminton for the third straight week.... partly to my own surprise ;) One hour and 2 broken shuttles later I and my friends returned home. Then again the trio (Mama, me and Vrushali) were off. Met my aunt and had another good meal with their family. Went to see off Mama at the railway station after that. That concluded a rather nice and tiring weekend.   Evolution   I finally managed to get some time to download newly released testing binaries of Evolution (1.5.9.1) and see first hand what so many people were praising. I join that crowd as far as the neatness of the new GUI is concerned.... Installation was not so much of a breeze as I thought it would be, but since my system at office is not a standard Fedora configuration (its a result of numerous RPM upgrades of RH 9.0) I half-expected things to break anyways.... I had to remove the evolution data created by the older evo and move the older gconf entries out of the way too. Then Evo 2 beta came up nicely. The disappointment was that I lost a few old mails in the inbox of Evo 1.4 and had to configure my account and re-create my mail filters all over again (basically start from scratch). Logged in to IRC to see what I did wrong and learn a few tips in case installation should have been more easy for me anyways. Happened to meet NotZed who showed me how to reclaim my 'Sent' mails from Evo 1.4.... Was very pleased to get that done. Now, I just need to get my addressbook imported again. But that, my friends, is another story :)

        Word processor woes   Topic for the day.... why is MS Word is the de-facto standard?! I've used that software for years now, at college and at work and never thought so much about it as I do these days since I've started using Fedora as my default workstation. Here is what is my evaluation....   The good:  I like the interface. Its good to have keyboard shortcuts for almost all your regular work; and given some patience you can even understand specifics such as how to get your templates and auto-text to function as you want them to. Its a good editor for documents which are less than 100 pages long. On Windows, I did not know of any utility which came close to offering the functionalities I would get in word.... at least a couple of years ago AbiWord and OpenOffice were not in the same league, I felt.   The bad:  For all the convenience to create the document, it offers nothing but major inconvenience to share it once your work is done. There is no default PDF export function available. The word document format is not made available for others to be able to write/edit a document made in Word using any other software. For the same reason, MS Word does not allow you to save your work in any open format which would be handled better by other editors. In other words, a pure and undiluted monopoly. If I need to give a document out to others, I have to hope that they have MS word installed on their system.... and preferably the same version as what I'm using. (I've seen colors get screwed when an Office 2000 doc is opened in Office 97).   The downright ugly:   urlLink This link  may come as a surprise to some MS users. That the word format stores some information about the document creator was known to me (I think I know how to instruct word to store correct information for the creators), but that it would include text from other open documents was a surprise. I don't know under what conditions this happens, but ignorance is certainly not bliss in this case.   If you are reading this and still not convinced, I think  urlLink this article  on the GNU site may do a better job of explaining it....

        Things you get to see from other blogs   Browsing from  urlLink PlanetGnome  led to some interesting pages on  urlLink IMDB . These are the  urlLink top 250  and  urlLink bottom 100  movies rated by users online.... Suddenly, I feel better about not getting enough TV time on some days.  From  urlLink slashdot : Here's someone who can  urlLink tell  which parts of america prefer to use the word 'pop' and which like to use the word 'soda' for carbonated drinks. I'd like to see a similar study for Indians who use the words 'cokk', 'phanta' and 'coool drink'.

        Weekend highs   Had a really relaxing experience at a restaurant after a long time. The place in question:  Bombay Post  on Airport Road (Carlton Center). Cuisine is primarily north indian and not extremely high on spices (which is good for my taste buds). Price tag is on the expensive side with bill touching around 800/- for a couple. Its worth the money for an unhurried (but not overly slow) lunch. Ambience is good too. Do try the  Jewel Thief  if you like black currant :)  Another weekend, another movie. This time it was Potter time. Checked out  urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . The book was more gripping I thought, especially because the director had to remove some content to fit the movie within the desired length. But, all in all, decent entertainment.... worth the 45 minutes I spent in queue to get the tickets ;)  And, last but not the least, a  big  thanks to the blogger folks for their service :)

        Night outs and Pilani....  I guess for almost all BITSians, these 2 things go along together. Okay, I agree, I'm almost an old timer now since its been 4 years from college; but yesterday's night-out reminded me  of the 'good old days'. The sore difference was that I missed my wingees. It used to be fun to put laccha even when you thought you were just about to give in and go to bed. The topic never mattered.... maximize the time awake and minimize the genuine output of the activity (in most cases.... "Lets go for chai/maggi at ANC. We'll come back and ghot after that!") I wished it had been my wing and ANC all over again. But then, there was work to be done....

         General ramblings   Things are going okay for the last couple of days. Nothing particularly new or interesting to write about at the moment. So this post is more like a list of ramblings.... come to think of it, everything in my blog is more like a list of ramblings in the life of 'yet-another-software-programmer'. Ocasssionaly I do write about work or software or echo other people's point of views (which I agree with). But for the most part, I like to talk and talk.... and talk about casual stuff.        Picasa      The topic for the day is the now free Google Picassa software.   I had been looking at Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 demo for some time recently and I had liked the convinience that it offered. So much so that I had called up at least 2 Adobe retailers in the city to find out what a licenced copy would cost me. Sadly, I never got any proper response and the thing persisted like that because the demo version was okay for the mean time since most of my requirements are to do with organizing the photographs into albums and viewing/searching them.        But now coming to Picasa, the following sums up my opinion:           I was quite impressed on the usability front when I gave it a whirl recently. I distinctly remember getting a Jasc Software demo download for similar purpose, but I found the GUI was simply not good enough. I uninstalled it after the first hour or so that I used it. For me to use a photo organization software, it  has  to have a good interface. Picasa scores heavily on that front. Its elegant and simple. Sort of like most GNOME apps that I like. Its easy to do most stuff and is presented very neatly. The menus are not heaily nested and 'organized' in that sense.        Another big plus is the fact that I can post images to this blog online from the app. Although I haven't tried my hand at that yet, I'm sure I will soon. Going by what I've heard from my friends it should be a nice no-hitch experience.       I read it serves as a means to transfer photographs between friends using the app. That would be a nice thing too. I'd rather not send huge pics through mail or reduce their size by uploading to a photo album site. I would really love to send images in the actual size to my friends. So I look forward to that too.             The downsides that I found during my trial run were:           there is no zoom option.       there's little image manipulation that one can do from within Picasa. The enhancement and the red eye reduction work well.... but still, it would have been good to have a few manual controls instead of only one-click operations.        the software litters Picasa.ini files all over the hard disk (I would like to know the necessity for those files sometime, maybe I'm missing something here).        there is no option to change a photograph's creation date timestamp. This usually gets in my way of navigating on the timeline. If I take a scanned pic and enhance it in GIMP or some app like that, then when I come back to Picasa I end up having the pic showing up as recent instead of old. Or even if I get pics in mail from a friend, they end up having a wrong timestamp. Adobe allows you to correct this.... I wish Picasa did too. I need to do some RTFM to see if there is any workaround for this issue.       there is no Linux port for this application too. Maybe I can use it with Wine. But I'll have to try that some time at leisure. I dislike booting into Windows for specific apps. If only I could find something equivalent or better on Linux. But that requires some more search.           All in all, Picasa is more than just flashy software. It serves most (if not all) of my photo management requirements and is free to use, so I can definitely recommend it to a friend. Adobe may still have an edge over Picasa at present, but at least the competition has increased for it. I can only hope for better things to come :)

         Personal stuff   Its mid-week and time  is flying . Went to Golden Palms resort on Monday evening. Was a nice trip. Felt good to talk to Mama after a long time. The place does look grand. Too bad, I don't have any pics to upload. Looking forward to spend this weekend at Ahmedabad if that trip goes as planned.     Work and misc  * Could not agree more to  urlLink this post  from Callum McKenzie. I've been in a project which used C and where memory allocation/de-allocation was a mess because we were afraid of customers who would 'go to bed thinking gotos are bad' (in the words of my lead). I wish there were more people like this guy.  * Yay! I notice Blogger sports a new look again. I like the keyboard shortcuts and stuff.... though I thought the previous look for composing messages was good too.

        Philosophy.  Never studied it, but have one none the less ;) To see which thinker would you agree with, you can try  urlLink this page . My first 5 results were:  1. 	Aquinas   (100%) 2. 	Jeremy Bentham   (89%)   3. 	John Stuart Mill   (79%)   4. 	Aristotle   (76%)   5. 	Epicureans   (62%)    Note: The highest score, 100, represents the closest philosophical match to your reponses. This is not to say that you and the philosopher are in total agreement. However this is a philosophy that you may want to study further.

        Almost here.  So many things....  * the long awaited weekend is almost here.  * the passport renewal is almost here. * the expected refund for the real-estate hunt that went awry is almost here. * the visit to the travel agent is almost here. * the completion of my house shifting exercise is almost here. If only I could remove the 'almost' and get on with it ;)   Memories.  As I collected my stuff from my present residence and moved towards my next, I realize I have a load of stuff which (strictly-speaking) does not make much sense to keep, but which I think I'll be nostalgic about if I let it go. I wonder, does this happen to everyone? :)

        Weekend approaching....   Continuing from where I left off last time:   The real estate hunt proved too much to take. After hours spent in talking to the builder, financers, family, friends and the lawyer we finally hit on a stumbling block that forced me to let go of the same. I'm exhausted.... but still not sure if I should take a break from the whole thing for a little while or to press further and carry on to the next builder, and the next, and the next.... what was that bit about perseverance again? ;)  Had a nice trip to Delhi (apart from the not-so-nice experience in the morning). Spoke to Sandy after a long time. Missed Nirula's burger though.... Maybe next time? ;)   Later in the day:   Got drenched again. But for a change, I don't mind it so much. Point is I got my work done for which I had to venture out.   Upgrade to Thunderbird working very fine for me. Tempted to switch back from Evolution. But I shall wait for Evo 2 before making any decisions.

And a very big thanks to the guys who called in or mailed in and gave their wishes.   But the biggest thanks of all to my fiance who made a cake for me, got some really lovely gifts (note the plural) and   made me feel extremely special for all the   bhaav   I was getting ;)      PS: I now have 2 big Dave Barry books to enjoy! I like that guy's writings. For those who enjoy reading sarcastic humour with a lovely insight into life, you will not be disappointed to try the  urlLink Miami Herald articles here .

On other notes, I'm back to using Thunderbird since I finally gave up on importing my t-bird contacts into Evolution and more importantly, because I discovered   this  . I'm still to complete the procedure, but it sounds great. *Just* the thing I need.

         Documentation generators  Spent some time yesterday reading up doxygen and its usage. Also, in related work, read up a little about Javadoc. Since I might be working on Java code sometime soon, this was nice piece of information. Am quite impressed with doxygen in particular, though the Javadoc commenting style does not look very attractive to me.... (I've used a different coding style all along, so that comes more naturally even now). I think it would be wise to change habits now to use Javadoc style since that can be used (thanks to doxygen) for generating documents from several programming languages including C++. Or maybe I need to look a little deeper....  PS: Just read on a blog site about this   cool phone accessory  . Wow!
