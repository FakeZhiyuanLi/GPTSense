      =) Am very tired after today. Watched a series of movies. Good movies, movies I've seen before, movies I haven't, old ones, new ones... Yeah basically that's the gist of today.  Went out with Ms Wong. haha. Some girls from school are, dare I say, jealous? =) Too bad. I don't give a damn, seriously. Jealous, so what? It doesn't affect me. Nor Ms Wong. Our consciences are clear. We're doing nothing wrong. Oh yeah. =)  So, yeah, as I was saying, we were just talking about movies... And I realise she watches movies once a week on average. *Hears the gasps from everybody* Yes. One movie. One week. Teacher = Supposed to be very busy, no? Apparently not =D  So, yeah. Both of us were crying ourselves silly during Troy (AGAIN!) and A Walk To Remember. Was at her house, you see. =) We used up like, 3 boxes of tissue? Okay  lah , the first box was almost empty. Hehe. Ohyeahs I was telling her about the shoe thing right after Troy and she burst out laughing. Whahahaha. So comical!  Will be going for the Media Camp from the 3rd to the 5th.. So yeah, bye everybody.. =) Journalism, here I come.. =) Ms Wong's the teacher in charge, yes. With Ms Leong! I'm gonna kachiao them like mad. Whahahaha.  Comments worth noting:  `We had to choose 20 participants for the camp. You were the first name that sprung into our minds.' -- Ms Wong =)  `IT WAS SO DAMN SAD WHEN HE DIED *SOBS*' -- (Yes, caps intended =P) -- Ms Wong  `I've watched The Day After Tomorrow.' `You've watched it? Never ask me go with you...' `I've watched Shrek too. Haha' `Yuck Ms Wong I hate you *=P*'  `How come *sniff* Paris doesn't *sniff* die? He should *sniff* die *sniff* because he's such *sniff* a hum*sniff*ji.' `Because *sniff* the directors were afraid that *sniff* the 10 million Orlando *sniff* fans will charge and murder *sniff* them.'  =D

      =)  Ms Leong rocks. Hehe. Well. She managed to appease my mum; not like I had extremely bad results  lah , but my mum suspects too much. *Shakes head* And expects too much from me as well... Oh well.  Ranked 2nd in class, though. Lost to Thunder. Hah. His maths got a frickin' 97? My average was only lower than his by 0.3, grr. Not fair!! 2nd in level as well. =) Beat Woonpeng and ZW! =) I'm a happy girl.  Comments worth noting from Ms Leong:  `A very responsible and helpful chairperson, I'm making her the chairperson for the whole of the year; the other classes are changing their hierachy.'  `I'm very impressed by how she is able to concentrate in class despite the chaos around and behind her!'                    (My class is notorious for being very noisy and rude to teachers =))   Teehee. =) Ms Leong is cool.

      =) I'm getting back my report card tomorrow. Let's see what kind of remarks/comments Ms Leong would put in the report!  `Sihui is a very nosey and inqisitive student who pries into teachers' affairs but if you get used to it she's quite okay.`  `She is a good class chairperson; although sometimes very forgetful and pushes herself all over the limit.`  `Always helpful and doesn't mind running errands for teachers.`  `I enjoy her presence and intelligent questions in class.`  whahahahha I'm so bhb. =D

      I want to sleep. I  need  to. I have eyebags under my eyes. But nevermind... I can catch up with sleep during the weekend. =)   He  said goodbye to me on the bus today. =) I didn't think he'd do that, though. I'm feeling happier now. Yay.  Had a lengthy talk with Ms Wong today... Personal affairs and stuff. *Hugs* Ms Wong, thanks for being there. I really appreciate it.

      Someone tell me why life is so unfair. Why do teachers leave us in the lurch. When all of them said they'd stay with us until we graduate. It's so bloody unfair.  First, Mrs Howard. It was she who promised us the most. And let us down the most too. What A1 for O's. When she isn't here for us? Sage is bad enough. I really appreciate she put me out of Sage.  Then to Parsley. With Ms Leong. Now she dropped a bombshell. "There's a very high possiblity that I won't be teaching Parsley anymore." What she said this morning.  She'd be teaching Sec4s.  What crap.  I'm disillusioned.   ETA:   Calmed down quite a bit... =) Didn't expect an outburst myself. But I'm really very disillusioned. I hope no more teachers will start telling us they'd be going. Not until we graduate.  Went for CIP today, as said yesterday. Funny experience plucking mushrooms off the logs. Ms Leong and Mrs Chang were sitting there talking while we  fooled  did some gardening. =) Then came home, totally xiasway because Ms Wong was waiting in school for me for like half an hour. Didn't turn out very bad though, after she told me she came to school to settle some stuff on her table. Then we made a trip up her table. Haha. It's now very clean and tidy. So I asked:   Me: How long did you wait for? Her: Erm, about 2 hours. I cleared papers, took out unwanted folders, cleared computer folders, and cleaned up the table; went down to the canteen to buy sweets [*She points to her container*] and waited in the car. Me: [*Aghast*] Then you should've SMS-ed me and tell me to go home by myself!!! Her: Well. I felt it was okay doing this. =)   She gave me a toothy grin. Hahahahahhahahahha. Cute. =) So after that we got home, she stayed for a while, then had to go out for a school function, and then Jiaqi called to ask if I wanted to go down to Toro's autograph session. So I pia-ed to the MRT station, then her father drove us there... In the end, I left even before Toro came. Laughs. Jiaqi had Ame there too so it's okay. Besides I don't like to squeeze with people. =)  I'm off to revise a little for chinese (express)! =)

      ohmigosh, the chem teachers decided to moderate the poor results by adding 5 more marks to  everybody . Which means I got 71! =)=)  I'm going to Kent Ridge Park tomorrow for CIP (Community Involvement Programme) and have to report to school at 8 a.m.. `Bleaugh. When I thought I could sleep in late tomorrow. I'm involved in the drama performance on Tuesday, too! Ms Wong saw us and was giggling away. o.O  We were totally `xiaswaying Ms Leong just now.    "Ms Leong, we love you!" "Ms Leong, we support you forever!" "Ms Leong, wo men yong yuan ai ni!" "Ms Leong, we will miss you!" "Have a good trip home, Ms Leong!" "Ms Leong! Wo men yong yuan zhi chi ni!!!"   Haha... She was like "EH?" and then went:   "Yes, the whole school knows you will miss me." "Yes, yes, my loyal supporters, I will love you too!"   So cute. =) And so is Ms Ng... I got her favourite book home. Before she allowed me to take it, she was all like:   "Remember, I want it in perfect conditions, no bends, scratches..." -- Ms Ng "Ms Ng, I treat books like friends so don't worry. If anything happens to your book I'd buy a new one for you!" -- Me   All the teachers are so nice. =)   Ms Khoo: "Sihui, I'd expected you to do better." Me thinks: "WTF?" Me says: "Oh, um, because the day was together with the maths exam and I was concentrating more on maths... *nods solemnly*" Ms Khoo: "Ohhhhhh... That is so sad for you..."  *Dies laughing*  She is so gullible. Mwah. And no, she's not a young teacher (Like Ms Ng, Ms Wong and Ms Leong). In fact, she's an old maid. Who is biased with boys. And doesn't like girls alot. =) So... Explains why I was lying through my teeth. Haha.   Oh, and Ms J's getting married on the 6th of June. I'm on her priority list for invites. =) The only student too! Now, if only Ms Wong would get married... *Winks* Yeah, I won't even mind being a flowergirl. Like for Mrs Howard.  =( Speaking of Mrs Howard. She's leaving Singapore for good. 30th of June. I was really sad when I heard the news. She was my English teacher, and I'm considered close to her (Hello? Flowergirl?) and well... =) I hope we'll keep in contact!  Anyway, I wanna go sleep. Adequate rest is important, ain't it? ;)

      =) Aah. Got back all my results and they... well, suck. For me, that is. Here's a run through of the list: (Note that all scores have been calculated to 100%)   English:  74.6%. I hope the teachers round up and then I'd have an A1. The paper is so friggin' hard, I tell you. Something about Penan and tribes and stuff. =) Ms Leong stamped a "Top Effort" on the paper. I can safely say my paper was the only one she did that for. Hah.   (A1. Hopefully.)    E. Literature:  73.9%. Not too bad, and the teachers were quite pleased, so I think it's okay? I could've pushed for a A1, though. =) My literature is ranked #1 in my class. Teehee.  (A2.)    Higher Chinese:  71.5%. Yuck yuck yuck. Although I don't like the subject... =) It's an okay result. Felt that I could've done better though. If my composition had been written a bit better. Or rather, if I had more time to write more for the argumentative essay. =)  (A2.)    E. Maths:  83.5%. Whahahahhaha. The only girl who got a distinction + Ranked #3 in class. Not too bad. =)  (A1.)    A. Maths:  73%. Not too good. But more than 3/4 of the girls in class failed, and I still managed to get a distinction.  (A2.)     Combined Humanities:   History  --> 69.5% for the history paper; and blame it all on the source-based questions. =) My structured essay was only deducted of 4 marks out of 25 so I'm happy! =)   Social Studies  --> 92%. I am  so proud  of this paper. Ms Ng rocks. =D I was deducted marks from my SBQs(again!) and I got full marks for the SEQs. =D  (Combined Humanities rawscore: 80.75%)  (A1.)    Physics:  72%. Ehhhh. =(  (A2.)    Chemistry:  (Ms Wassan is a terrible setter of a paper) 66%. HORRORS! But hey, more than half of the level failed. Haha. =P  Edited to Add:  WOOTS! 5 more marks for moderation. Which means Chemistry = 71 = A2!  ( B3 A2.)   So that makes my L1R5... Wait lemme count. =D  9 8! I want to aim for a perfect 6 pointer, though. =( And after deduction of higher chinese and CCA points (I'm already way above 10 ;)) It'll be 5 points. Think that'll be good enough to enter NJC? =)  PS: I  did  cry during Troy. =(

      =) It's officially (Actually not, but who cares anyway) the end of the evil mid-year papers. Now all Nanhuarians can relax, and wait for the dreaded day when the results will rush back to us. Yuck.   Myself, I went to SzeTeng's house to watch The Park and I think I was reacting quite a little overboard. I mean, The Park was supposed to be a  scary  movie. I was crying at the last part. =$ Eek. It was really sad! The thought of having to shoot photographs of those you have caused the deaths of, and not being able to hug your own brother, and watching your mum die protecting you.. =) However, this doesn't happen in real life. So there. =P  I'll be watching Troy tomorrow. =) Had good reviews from friends who watched it, so I think it's pretty okay. I just hope I don't bawl over when people die in the film. Bah. =) I spent a few hours playing CM4 today... It was quite refreshing because I haven't been playing it since a few days before the midyears. I have now regained my freedom of play and  there's no need for me to do things sneakily anymore! Whee. Which means I have a few things on my list that I need to do:  Put up content on my website  Leo Piper: Forbidden - Design & Content  Help Cas do up her blog - i.e put the design up and stuff  I'd add on the list if there's anything I need to. =)  Mum wants me to sleep now. =) I want to sleep too, actually. HCL listening comprehension tomorrow. Why don't the CL people come too. It's too unfair. Speaking of papers, today's Lit was fairly easy. =) Mdm N. gave us the whole chunk of information for that particular question. I should've known it was what she set! But I think I'll pass this time round (After all, I  did  hand in my Anthology =) ) and well... Let's hope for the best!   It's 10.03pm and I'm still crapping. Old habits die hard, I suppose! =) I want to pamper myself but I know I must revise for the coming common tests and other exams. In Singapore lingo, yes, it's  kiasu  but logical, isn't it? The subjects that I'm taking aren't those that you can study overnight and score well in! Things like, er, physics, HCL, chemistry, literature, and especially history/SS. =) I want to study. I want to score well. I want to enter a prestigious JC (In my case, NJC =) ) and I want to become a teacher. I don't want a tiny slip in my results to cause trauma in my life!!!   You can ignore the paragraph up there because I was paranoid. =) But when am I not paranoid, I ask? I fret over the simplest of things. Besides doing that, I still worry incensively(Er?) over things I should not. =) I won't go in details, though. Be glad. Be very glad. Be glad that you are not one of the ( 2 3!) people I complain to. Ms Wong, Ms Leong and ST. =) Cool eh.   I updated RWAC. =)   urlLink What The World Needs Now  ! Click and read and review! Whee. I hope the people involved won't kill me =)  Alright, tata, I gotta sleep =)
