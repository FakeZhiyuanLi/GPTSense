       Check out these links for photos.        urlLink Photo Number One     This is a scanned photosticker of mine. I took this with my friends at Robinson's. We watched Spiderman, and then shopped, among other things.        urlLink Photo Number Two     This is Belle. I felt bad about cropping the picture, but ah well. She's in the other photosticker as well. She's not hard to spot. The other girl, by the way, is her older sister, Anna.       More coming soon, count on that!

       Once upon a time, in a place far far away, and in a time that was long, long ago, there lived a princess. This was at a time that there were many princesses in the land, and they were not uncommon. Princes were many too. Princes lived relatively easy lives, besides all the hunting, politics and the occasional rescuing of a damsel in distress, yes, they live easy lives. Think of all the good things they got. Feasts every night. Maids ready to pamper them. Whole castles -- theirs to rule. And add to that, if you're a prince, you can basically do anything you want.   That also includes being able to pick any princess in the land to marry you. And because you're a prince, it doesn't matter that they don't want to marry you, or that they hate your guts, or that they think you're a disgusting pig and should get a haircut because that style is sooo last century, it all doesn't matter! You're a prince, and that's what matters.  On the 15th of July, Princess Julianna Arisben Riyala Nostradam is born. Obviously, Princess Julianna Arisben Riyala Nostradam is a very special princess -- hence the long name. Before the story about this very special princess can continue, we must learn about her parents.  Her mother's name was Mary Elizabeth Nostradam, maiden name Malone. She was not of any royal descent, but actually was a lowly peasant, whose family worked in the fields. Mary Malone grew up with straw in her dark brown hair and the smell of manure a constant companion. But she had a heart of gold, and Prince Roberto John Nostradam the Second, could see that. He fell deeply and madly in love with her, and because he was a prince, he was entitled to do anything he wanted. So, begrudingly, his parents, Queen Elizabeth and King Roberto John the First allowed the marriage, and on a cold winter day, when the air was frigid and you could see your breath come out in white mist, Mary Malone, a lowly peasant, was forever united with Prince Roberto John Nostradam, the Second. That day, was the 5th of December. Since that day, Mary Malone was Mary Malone no more, she became Mary Nostradam, and to please her mother-in-law, adopted Elizabeth as a middle name. So she became Mary Elizabeth Nostradam. Queen Elizabeth was very pleased, and the two women began a close friendship.   A couple of months later, Mary becomes pregnant -- Prince Roberto is delighted. He orders a huge banquet, and even invites Mary's family to join. Despite the fact that there were many lovely French maidens entertaining, Prince Roberto does not commit adultery. Mary is delighted, and realizes that their bond is true. She loves him especially that night.   At around early January, King Arthur passes away, quietly, in his bed, and on the 23rd of January, Prince Roberto John Nostradam becomes King. Mary, though heavy with child, attends the coronation. A couple of months later, around mid-March, a neighboring kingdom thinks that King Roberto is a wimpy king, so they decide to attack. King Roberto rides out with an army of many thousands to meet the attack. The war lasts for a couple of months, but King Roberto is triumphant. After making the necessary arrangements to take over the defeated kingdom and assimilate it as his, he makes it back in time for his baby's birth.   So, it is July the 15th. Early morning, Queen Mary goes into labour. Mid-wives rush to the scene, and one is sent off to find King Roberto John, and after five drueling hours, the baby is born.   "Tis a girl, milady," Brona, one of the mid-wives, says. She wraps the newborn baby girl in a blanket and hands her to Queen Mary. Narobi, another mid-wife, goes to the door, and tells King Roberto, who has been pacing outside the door for the last five hours, that he can come in now. Abigail, the third mid-wife who was the one sent out to find King Roberto John, is cleaning up.   The door bursts open just as Queen Mary Elizabeth has taken the babe into her arms. She looks into the babe's face, and then up at her husband. She says, "Roberto, isn't she beautiful? Just beautiful?"   King Roberto John gazes into the babe's face, and cannot help a smile breaking onto his face. He feels a fluttering and bubbling in his stomach. He feels immensely happy. His voice breaks as he exclaims, "I'm a father, I'm a father!"   The next day, the newborn girl is baptised as Julianna Arisben Riyala Nostradam. "Why the long name?" King Roberto askes his lovely, lovely wife after the baptism. "Tis such a mouthful."   Queen Mary says simply, "My husband, she's a special one. I know it. I've known it since the moment I gave birth to her. A special one like her, deserves a special name." She smiles playfully, looking into her husband's deep blue eyes. "I know you like her name too."   King Roberto looks right back into his wife's light grey ones. "Well, maybe." They lean towards each other, and kiss. A quick one because Brona is coming back with Julianna in her arms, squirming and restless. "Milady, she's hungry," Brona says. She hands Julianna to Queen Mary, curtseys, and leaves.   After Queen Mary has fed Julianna, she cradles her in her arms, and sings her a sweet lullaby. King Roberto sits next to Queen Mary, making faces at the baby so that she laughs, and stays awake. Eventually, Queen Mary hits King Roberto, so that he can stop making little Julie laugh. She needs her sleep. Now, don't you have any important political things to do?   King Roberto rises, and says that he always has important political things to do. A quick kiss, and he is off striding towards the monks. Queen Mary stares lovingly after King Roberto for a moment, and then turns her head back to little Julie. She starts to sing again.   "Sleep now, my dear child, for your mother is singing you this sweet lullaby to show you that she loves you She loves you..  "And may your dreams be pleasant with beautiful flowers and butterflies honey bees, and majestic skies  "Whenever your mother sings you this sweet lullaby..."

       Hello. This is my photo blog. I'm just posting random photos here.

        Well, if I say so myself, I think this photoblog of sorts has been doing pretty well. It certainly   looks   nice. Doesn't it?    Anyway, I would've written earlier/sooner except that the modem has been broken for about five days. I'm not exactly sure how long, since I've never really had a good sense of time -- that is, ever since my watch broke and the year ended, and my beloved Harry Potter calender (that cost a fortune) was no longer usable. Those were pretty much my only sources of time.    If you were wondering how I've been these past five days, well, the answer is: pretty good. Lately though, I've been having a certain, well,   reluctance,   in getting out of bed (even though I have been sleeping in) but I'm guessing that I won't be having this same reluctance for long. Internet is back, there are things to do! I have discovered that my life is quite dull without the internet, really.    I have gotten a few things done with my embroidery. Without internet on to keep me occupied, I have managed to do a few other things. Embroider, for one. Read. (although not as much as my bookworm-self would like) But, mostly I've been playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Trying to up my Amazon's (whose name is Blotty -- in "honor" of my Yahoo! sign-in name) level and avoiding Andariel as much as possible. I have also begun using a new character, an Assassin, whose name is Sapries. Don't ask me how she got it, I was rather stumped, and lately I've been writing whatever comes to mind.    Anyhow, enough about me, what   is   this entry supposed to be about?    Well, before I can begin, I must say first that I frequent boards. I used to be a part of many boards, but now, it has boiled down to a round (well, not round, but you get my meaning) three. One of them, is the Harry Potter Boards. More commonly known as   HPB  . (My username is sleepless -- if you're interested in joining and giving me a point for referrals. [;)) As in most HP boards, I get sorted, and I'm in Hufflepuff! I rather think that Hufflepuff suits me, and that I belong there. It's a fun house, and really, Hufflepuff has its share of smart, brave, and kind people. There are none that are really, well... sly. Or evil. It's not canon!    Anyhow, there is this new challenge,    found here.     It's called The Personal Badger Challenge! I have a badger myself,   Badger #11: The Babbling Badger.   And you bet you'll see my entry in here. I'm afraid that I'll have a hard time making it only two-hundred words though. After all, I   am   the babbling badger. [:)    Hope all reading are doing well!  For now, ciao!    Edited:   Oh wait, it has to be   over   two-hundred words! This is great!   urlLink

      Currently Listening to: And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead - How Near, How Far  Did you know this song was on the tv series John Doe? I immediately recognized it and got really really happy because it's such a great song, and how shall I explain myself?  Anyhow, I'm going to go to bed soon so I'm sure Mesu will be very very relieved. (Somewhere in the back of this bare and empty room, Mesu nods vigorously) Just typing another post because it's one of these wierd things I do. I don't understand it myself, really. (Be-be bonks Mrs. Eraser on the head, and she says "Ow!)  Don't mind that other post, by the way. By the way... who's reading? Anyhow, these past few entries were completely useless, and I fear that this entry will be useless too. You know what, screw the parenthesis, my muses should not be contained!!!! At this, Mesu rises up from the corner of the room, suddenly levitates and smoothly glides over to the.. the what? Center of the room? Well, I dunno. Mesu is a she, by the way. I finally remembered.  Oh really, why am I doing this?

      Currently Listening to: Sunny Day Real Estate - 47  Actually, you know, I'm having a lot of fun here. I just wrote myself a very boring profile and well, just checked out a few things and well, did stuff. But it's fun. Blogger is very very cool. No wonder lots of people use it. Anyhow, I really have nothing to write about. And so I'm just typing around, doing nothing of much substance. I haven't had dinner yet and I'm kinda hungry. Should I go eat?  "Yes!" shrieks Mesu. She, or maybe it was he, could no longer stand all this.. all this... whatever it was, the genderless Mesu can no longer take it, and is cradling his/her head in agony. Be-be, sitting next to Mesu, laughs mercilessly. "Don't stop Sarah, don't stop! Leave Mesu in agony," he says. Be-be throws back his head and laughs evilly: "Mwahahhaha!"  Kiyo is worried. She is worried about Mesu  and  Be-be. "Look Sarah, something is wrong with the both of them. What should we do?"  Sarah aka Elle aka Yu aka Mrs. Eraser frowns. "Well how am I supposed to know? I'm not a know-it-all, you know! You can't just all of a sudden ask me these things, and expect an answer from me! I just can't.. can't.." She breaks down and cries.  Kiyo throws her hands up in defeat. "Oh screw it. I'm going to go raid Be-be's life-time supply of ice-cream. I can't take this anymore."

      In the mean time, I'll just type around. If anyone is wondering why I got a blog in the first place if I don't even know what I'm going to do with it then, my reply is: good question. Well... I already have a  urlLink diary , you see, so I don't think I'll be doing a lot of personal writing, but I guess this blog is just for all things. I was thinking of putting in some stories around here too. I write, you know?   Fancy some mad girl like me writing, but yeah. Hmm. I'm sorry, I'm sort of loony and giddy right now. Would you like to know more about me? Hmmm... yes, maybe. I could type up something, but you see, I'm rather tired or writing about myself so I'll just pull something up from my other blog somewhere, and anyone who's reading this can read that.  The templates here are quite cool, no? Very very nice....

      Okay, so my name is Yu and I'm starting a blog. More details later, but I what I really want to do right now is just get this over and done with and see if this works or not! I've tried doing this before but there were some problems. Maybe later I will start writing about my dream about Spiderman. :)
