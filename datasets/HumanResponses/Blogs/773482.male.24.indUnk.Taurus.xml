        Jovi was great on the drive back from North Carolina which was much much shorter than the 11 hour drive down to Raleigh. The best part had to be when she had her first french fry and then proceeded to roll in something disgusting and sticky. Dirty dog in less than two hours after adoption. She was pretty good on her first night and slept for five hours. Little did I know how much I would appreciate that chunk of sleep time at once.
  Kami was not at all happy to discover that one of those evil little white animals she thought had been left behind in Michigan, had now followed her to her new PA home. She sulked for awhile until realizing that Jovi was on lockdown. Then she pranced. :) Jovi, in the meantime, is terrified of this caramel blonde animal who is three times her size and makes funny sounds at her. Since this meeting, Jovi thinks Kami would make a great playmate and tries to play with her tail when it hangs off the couch. I'm just waiting for Kami to smack her upside the head!
  Sunday was a  challenging day with many potty accidents inside. The funniest part has to be when Jovi discovered that there is a dog in the oven who looks at her every time she walks by. The first time I heard her bark was at this reflection. Now she growls at herself everytime in the kitchen. 
  The other kitchen battle occurs with morning feedings. Kami is used to being promptly fed the moment I wake up and not waiting one second longer. When I had the nerve to put Jovi's food down first, Kami body-slammed her out of the way and started to eat her food. We're still working out the kinks of the food system, but Kami is now fed first and I stand guard over Jovi to block Kami's vulture attempts.
  The last couple nights have been rough with the interrupted sleep for potty breaks. I don't know how people handle babies. I have newfound appreciation for them now! I'm hoping the nights get better soon because the RAs arrive this weekend and life is crazy busy for the rest of the month. There may not be enough coffee in the world to keep me awake through this.
