      there are people in my life that i have deemed life suckers. they are people who have no identity at all. somewhere in the grand scheme of things they never developed a personality. they take your taste in movies, music, clothes, or any absurd personality qwerk, and somehow it becomes theirs. it is a subtle process, and trust me, it doesn't mean that you are this cool, amazing person. it just means there is at least one aspect of you that can be life sucked. i will not go into specific details unless requested.  why do these life suckers exist. well, i have only been life sucked by two people, both female. this may only occur in females, but i have learned that this is usually the result of taking a fancy to a specific male. pathetic? yes. fiction? no.

      for being homeless and unemployed i sure haven't been keeping up with this thing. i guess this gives me a reason to take a break from my strenuous trash tv watching, but sometimes i guess my blog isn't enough to distract me from gathering details from the secret jlo marriage to marc anthony (i know!).  anyway, i have something to write about now since i spent some time away from judge joe brown. I was listening to Stevie Wonder's fulfillingness' first finale and the song "they won't go when i go" came on. it was weird because it was like hearing the song for the first time. the lyrics of the song are a perfect expression of what's going on with one of my closest friends, who i am going to refer to as miss. X. i guess it just goes to show that most people will in the end of it all disapoint you. that may make me a bitter cynical person, but, well, who cares. I can say without hesitation that she has probably never cared a thing about me or the other people close to her. but i guess that is just life. it all balances out in the end.

      i am completely baffled by my taste in men. i am having a hard time figuring out why i just have to fall in love with the disfunctional dregs of society. they are all insane, on drugs, or completely immature and incapable of having a normal relationship. is it me? i guess it is, but why? i just can't figure it out. and it's not like these guys are all winners in the looks deparmtent. i mean they're not ugly, but definately not good-looking enough to say, "hmm, i don't usually date coke heads, but i'll make this my one exception."  that's another thing, is this 1985 wall street or is coke on the comeback? maybe i'm just lame and should know this, but it seems like 'la coca' is the cool thing to do now, everyone just has to do coke. no more pot, just coke. it used to be the prep drug, but all sorts of cool people (and a lot of my friends) are doing it. oh well, i guess i will just have to find out if this fad will end soon and hopefully without me having to visit anyone in rehab. anyway back to my original point. i guess i just have to make the sacrifice and give up dating. i feel that i would be much happier single. i mean the only alternative is me going insane because of some guy. i would love to know what's wrong with me though, it would just make things so much simpler. maybe i'm the crazy one and they're all normal! i just don't know...

           i talked to my best friend last night and he gave me very sage advise. look at your life as if it were a tv program. this is very easy for me since i am very dedicated to television. i like to pretend that i will teach my kids to love books and pass up nick jr. for the "lion, the witch, and the wardrobe," but who am i kidding?      anyway, i am now looking at my life as a spin off. like it or not the people in my life now will be special guest stars, but there will be a lot of new characters(crazy or annoying or amazing). am i ready for this spin off? will it flop or be a success? this worries me because there is nothing worse than a bad tv show. i guess time will tell, at least millions of people won't be watching.

           as a new college graduate i find myself unemployed and extremely bored, so, i thought i'd try this blog thing. I hope that it slips between the cracks because I'm not witty or funny, but i do have an abnormal amount of dissatisfaction with the world, which is probably what i will choose to write about. i'm also a horrible writer/speller, so even if one person gets the gist of what i am trying to communicate, i guess i can call myself successful. right now i have a number of friends going off the deep end because their live are about to change quite abruptly, so i will depend of this as a somewhat sane form of outlet. ok. i'm going to go now...
