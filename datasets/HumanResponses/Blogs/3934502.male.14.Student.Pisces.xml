      Whew... Debate is over already and so is my Chinese presentation. I didn't do too well for the debate... 13 out of 20. But who the heck cares huh? I&nbsp;destroyed my teams definitions and debated pretty badly, so that was probably the main cause of it. The class also weren't quite following what I said so it was likely that my speech was contradictory and conflicting. I also accepted far too many POIs (Points Of Information), so I ended up wasting a lot of time, forcing me to skip an entire paragraph of useful information I could have used against the opposition! (Rar!)  Sigh... On the contrary however, my Chinese presentation has been better than expected. I got a reasonable 15 out of 20, much to my surprise. The speech was on teen smokers, but it's&nbsp;doubt it really represents what I think of&nbsp;them of smoking... Hehehe... Get the idea? Anyways, I got screwed for RE today because I didn't have my photographs and I didn't bother to get a CD. Man, how mean some people can be because I only recently ran out of CDs dammit! Those photos were damn big and how do you expect me to lug it to school? Take the whole notebook? Yeah right, and risk losing it in school, just for the sake of a stupid project. What's more, today we were told to assess one another, and guess what were the only marks for each section Alexander gave me. 1 or 2!!! That bloody arrogant idiot thinks that he's so great, and he keeps sneering at me and discriminates against me for no good reason at all. Someday I'll just break him, I swear it.  Heh, the com labs are still kinda faulty 'cos you can't log on to the server on some of the computers, so I'm suspecting a technical fault of some kind. But who cares? They ain't mine, so why bother? I've been given until Friday to complete both the photos and powerpoint presentation... Oh dear oh dear oh dear... Before I finish up this&nbsp;entry, I just have a request to make: please click on the links I have provided at the top of the page, 'cos I need your support here, thanks. By the way, does anyone know of a job which I can take up? I need the cash... For what? I won't answer that.

      Kao... My debate is tomorrow and I'm getting so stressed out! The day after that will be my yan jiang too! Aaagh! And my homework still isn't done! Aaaaagh! Lolx. Don't forget to help support my site by clicking on the links at the top of the page, thanks. I won't be telling you why I need them now, but I will when the time is right. Today's assembly was damn sian... Rambling on and on about helping disabled people and blah blah blah. I have a better idea: kill off all of them. Makes sense right? It's because of these retarded idiots that the good people can't get any better. They're a burden to society and by the Ultilitarian Theory, we should wipe them all out and rid us of our unneccesary worries and such. Wahaha... Today's Philosophy presentation was like the most unique - 'cos they were the most confused! Not saying that ours isn't, but they just ran through the issues like the same and I don't think they put much thought into it, as they ended the presentation without a&nbsp;conclusion! Lol! Ah what the heck... Sounding like a nerd now... After that was Physical Science... Still the same old ramblings... Nothing new. After that was Chinese... Nothing good. After that was Oral Communications... Nothing. But the real highlight was the matches in our class. It wasn't surprising considering that Judo has already become part of our life in the class, with Lee Jiao Lian throwing every other guy who got in his way (including me!),&nbsp; but in the last one he was pitted against Luo Yiheng, our resident poser. And did they stir up a commotion or what! Ming Xuan kept tossing Luo Yiheng just like that and with all the cheering everywhere, I'm surprised no teacher or even other students were attracted to our class. Eventually, in the last match Ming Xuan practically threw Yiheng and pinned him to the ground. Ouch! Hah, but that was really something before Martina Ong came. At first we thought she was absent, until I ran out to look for her (as usual, I'm the scout). Anyway, there wasn't anything new, just the usual notetaking in the darkness of only one out of the four sets of fluorescents in our classroom. Until, of course, Shaun, Kiat Wee and Prahlad started talking. That really pissed off Martina Ong and he told them all to leave. Of course, being the idiots they were (I love being biased), they refused to until we pressured them to do so. Clearly, both the Utilitarian and Kant's Imperative Theories state that they must go out, so there can't be a single leg for them to stand on (no arguments!). After that... Er... Nothing of course. Unless you want me to describe how to walk home and then post on my blog - duh.

      Ole! Friday! Weekends are back! Woohoo! I was timekeeper for the first intra-class debate of the year for our class, but everyone wanted to play with the bell and so there was a mad rush to press it and listen for that "ting". They would hear plenty of it later in the debate so I wonder why they were so curious for... And this was a sec 2 classroom! Wahaha... Now you people know how our class is. I nearly got thrown by Mao Wang today, and almost got pounded by Yu Tong (class monitor aka "thinker" or Zhu Lao Shi), but I managed to run away, but those are just normal class things. That's what you get when you put 3 judokas, 2 taekwando guys and 1 wushu guy in a class room plus a lot of violence-inclined youngsters. No other class, not even 2A can measure up to our discipline (we don't have any in the first place). 2A is the slacker class, pretty much a complement of our class, which explains why we are on such "good terms". 2C is the most "wu liao" class... Just confused and plain lost, but I never said ill-disciplined. My muscles hurt like crazy... Yesterday I was flag-bearer and was waving the flag right to the very end of the competition and man, was that flag heavy! It ain't easy waving that flag as high as possible all the way throughout the competition! But I think I was formidable enough against even all of the Chinese High flag-bearers put together (the product of ego). They may have won, but I claim a moral victory!

      Wah, thanks to Tian Zhi not coming for the debate, now both teams can have enough time to prepare for a good debate! Not good too, 'cos people will be expecting a really nice one. Anyways, the highlight of the day was that my class got selected to support the Judo Championships. Our classmate Ming Xuan (or also known as Lee Jiao Lian or Mao Wang) was one of the competitors and he managed to win over his opponent! But in the end, Chinese High had the power of numbers (and flags) and we lost. Damn them! Fortunately, RJC won in the A division boys, and since that was the most important one, we could just as well take comfort in it. But that competition was a hell lot less violent then we expected, and probably more injuring.&nbsp;The RGS judokas literally got held down by the pure force of the weight of their competitors - you should see the weight difference! On one side were the RGS judokas, normally-built for their category and on the other hand were the elephants of the C division girls. Bam! All they had to do was lie down and the RGS judokas couldn't get up. Oh well, back to sleep... Again... Zzz...

      Ole! Miss Peh gave us another chance to present our maths project so we wouldn't get a 0 for our presentation. But since I already split from my former maths group I had to do it all alone and likewise present it myself too. Anyway, I think I did pretty well, though she did comment that I kept looking at my script. Who cares anyway? I got an intra-class debate tomorrow! Aagh... So stressed out sia. And what's more, I think I have a sore throat, so how to debate? Besides, my debate script is so damned short - I don't think I can present enough to impress Mr Tan (English Literature teacher - or Tit, as we call him), or fill up the 4 minutes of my speaking time. Hopefully the opposition team isn't competent enough and we would be able to manage a victory... But till then I'm going to keep worrying my head off. I had some&nbsp;exposure&nbsp;to debates last week when I was the reserve speaker for two inter-house debates.&nbsp;During our brainstorming sessions, it seemed that they could think up points I would never have even have&nbsp;contemplated. I also picked up a few things that could be useful here, but... Oh well. Better to sleep now!

      Weekend's over... Back to school... Sheesh. And what's more, my Eve Online trial account is probably on its last day or something. I managed to pass up my project on Graphs to Miss Peh on time (7:25 am as promised)&nbsp; this morning, though I was working late into the night the day before - I think I was still doing it at around 1 am? Anyway, my class (entire Sec 2 level in fact)&nbsp;had our Chinese Oral Test today, and I most probably failed, since my command of the Chinese language is ba-a-ad. I couldn't even speak a single fluent sentence! Think about it, three components and I didn't even have a single good point for any of them. I guess I got pretty stressed out in the classroom while waiting for my turn... Ah well, so much school, and so little time... Oh yeah, forgot to do my homework again... Cya!

      Ah well, school sucks. More homework every day. Today, Miss Peh (Math Teacher) made us present our findings on the application of linear graphs in everyday life, which was much to our horror and surprise. Of course, few of us actually did it and in the end, only two groups were prepared while another two made impromptu presentations and the majority of the class ended up not having done a single thing. As a result, those who had not presented at all got a definite 0 out of 9 marks for their presentation. Then I keep forgetting my work again (punishment likes me - but I don't like punishment), so I got scolded again, and again, and again. Nothing much really... Hehe. Eve Online rawks, but the only problem is buying a code for it... Sigh. Any way, this is my first post, so stay tuned for more updates!

      Heh, haven't updated my blog in a long time. Funny thing that I'm updating it in the morning, too. Anyway, National Day was yesterday, and I must say, 'twas nothing spectacular. I was expecting some dramatic performance like those in the past years' National Day Parade, but I was severely mistaken. There were just a lot of formations and stuff, and I would have appreciated it if only the cameras in the National Stadium didn't start crapping up! The performances were ho-hum, and the commenters were like running off a script on how patriotic and enthusiastic the crowd was, and how "moved" they were by the "meaningful" performances. I hate propaganda in any form, and this clearly can be seen here. The stage, even, was said to be "specially designed for the performances on hand", but I say, why the hell are the ramps there? No vehicle ever goes up there, no one in fact even walks up there in the first place! So all that "artwork" and "effort" has gone into creating a stage that is ab-so-lute-ly useless? What's more, they even remixed just about every song, and it was only towards the end of the parade were the original ones played! At first I though, ah okay, only a few songs remixed, but it turned out that nearly all of the songs - yes,  nearly all  - were remixed! Does anyone know how much I hate remixes already? Remixes are really just good songs ruined by techno and so-called "upbeat" rythmns, and now they have to do that to these national songs and take away the element of emotion and patriotism! Aren't 39 years enough for any of us to learn anything? Does USA remix their national songs? Does Malaysia even alter their songs? Why do  we  have to do it then? That aside, the only interesting part was the fireworks session. 6,000 different types of fireworks from all over the globe, converged to one small island for a short 3 and a half minute display. Nothing great? Well, at least the variety of fireworks kept me happy enough. There were these comets and sub-shell fireworks (small firework shells packed into a firework shell - something like submunitions in weapons), plus a variety of other treats for the eyes. GWG woudl probably like to note that a notable number of these came from Australia! Oh well, gotta go!

      Same thing every 168 hours... Back to school again. Sigh... Sigh... Sigh... Wel, at least there's one good thing: I did my maths assignment at last! LOL... Not that it's supposed to be a great achivement, but more like I haven't actually passed up the previous few maths assignments. ^^ I wouldn't be surprised if I failed my maths... Anyways, I'm still on "good" terms with Samuel Kwek (Shamuel Quack/Sa Mao)... If you're from 2B you should know what I mean... Heh heh heh... Sacarsm aside, as I write this post right now I can hear a lot of booming in the distance. I know it's pretty rainy these days, but these booms aren't the normal rumbles of thunder - instead they sound like cannons... And  very  much like cannons at that. I wonder if it's a live-firing exercise out there... But the sounds just come from every direction in the north, so if it is indeed a live-firing exercise, I must say it's pretty darn far inland. Then again, I could be wrong. Thunder is, after all, quite frequent in this areas and it wouldn't be much of a surprise if it was thunder. But it can't be, because the booming just stopped altogether... Oh well who cares? None of my business riiite? The whole day I was confined to the house to read and read and read... Books of course, but I managed to get a few minutes to myself and the computer, as I have just done to write this blog post. My mother had a leg injury last week because she fell down, and during her retreat on Friday, she fell down again, so now that leg injury has gotten from bad to worse, so she's pretty much disabled for some time to come. As of yet, I don't think she might be able to go to work, so that means she'll probably be at home for the next few weeks... Eeek! Byee... My time online is up!
