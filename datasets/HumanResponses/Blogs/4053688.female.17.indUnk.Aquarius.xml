      Today, I went to Monterey Park with my mom and brother. I did in the end, go to that academy and it turns out that I will be going to classes until my SAT testing. Right now, my scores are on average a crappy 1010, and in these few months, I have to raised it up to at least 1400. I am hoping that I reach 1500, but 500 points in a few months is supposed to be really hard, so this means that I have to work really hard. This also means, less online time, less fun times... basically, less hanging out and being loose all the time. I may even have to cut back on gym time... unless I'm studying vocab or something, then I'll just walk for about 2 hours, while I memorize vocab. I think that's reasonable.  I asked my mom if I could go to that dance tomorrow. It's a key club thing. I told her that I need to help out and volunteer and stuff like that, and she said okay... she believed me. I'm relieved because if she didn't, I wouldn't be able to go.  From now on, less going out, with the exception of: the dance tomorrow, Knott's (or Raging Waters or another theme park), and maybe DDR competition day. I'm limiting my movies to once every other week, unless I really want to see something, then maybe once a week. It's time for serious business.  When going online, I'm limited to: homework (sparknotes, etc.), blogs (that's a lot actually), and minor chatting. Only an hour a day of the later stuff. Homework is limited to 2 hours.  I just hope I can follow these guidelines that I just gave myself. Now, I must play pictionary, as this is my last chance for a long time. Goodbye.

      I feel much better today. A few times yesterday, I was on the verge of crying, now I don't feel like crying anymore. Perhaps though, that if I did cry, I would feel tons better anyway, because crying does that to you. They say crying doesn't solve anything. That may be true, but crying sure does make you feel better.    Today, I found out that Melinda knows about Susan's blogger, so Susan's not linking this blog anymore, for fear that Melinda might read my previous entry. This is how I feel about it: I don't care if she reads it. I mean, I don't like hostility, and I don't want to create any, but I hate lying. I will not delete my words out of fear of hurting someone's feelings. The only thing that could seem to have contradict my statement is that I had some hostility with Zuri back in freshman year, but to be honest, I think that was different. For one thing, I was a different person back then, and even if I wasn't, I honestly did want to be Zuri's friend. It was in my nature then, I guess. Nowadays, I don't really seem to care if I lose certain people as friends, because then they must not be worth my time. Now, don't get me wrong, if Zuri and I started fighting or whatever happened, I would be sad; I would still want to be friends with her, but some other people are a different story.    There is only one person that I regret ending a complete friendship with and that's Nancy. I'm not even sure that it would be called regret, but it's just a longing I have every now and then to talk to her. I guess, it's because, I want to hear her side of the story. I want to know why things ended the way they did. I want to see from her point of view, but I don't know that I want to talk to her. Brandon asked me the other day: "what's the worst that could happen [if you talk to her]? you might actually become friends?" The worst thing that could happen is precisely that. I do not want to be friends with her, because I might be blinded again, and hurt again and I don't need that. I've changed a lot because of my friendship with Nancy and I know it's made me bitter, and the sad part is that, I don't care about my being bitter.    Anyway, I got side tracked. If I talk about you on here and you don't like it, you can either don't read it, or tell me and maybe we can talk about it... I promise I'll be honest with you.    Later tonight, I'm going to go to Gautam's house to watch some movies. I think it will be fun. A bunch of us will be there and late night movies at Gautam's house are one of my favorite things to do. Since I had some left over chips from the Potluck today from ROP class, I took it over to Gautam's house so we can eat it later. I'm going to tell my mom that I'm going to the gym. I would tell her the truth, but then, I get the feeling she's going to yell at me that I'm going out too much, she does that a lot.    Tomorrow morning, my mom and I are going to this school/academy. If things go well, I'll be enrolled in this SAT class. I will have to work really hard, but it will be worth it if when I see my score, I get a 1400 or higher. I really do hope that I will work hard though, because I'm lazy a whole heck of a lot.

      I wish Eric was online, because right now, I really want to talk to someone. It seems though, that lately, Eric doesn't go online at all anymore. I'm guessing he's either skating, swimming or working out at the gym. I just hope it's not the later. I'd be annoyed if they went to the gym and didn't even call me. I know I'm not gonna go today, but that's beside the point. I just want to know that they would think of me... invite me to go with them... you know?    Two Fridays ago, I ran over a red light and I got caught by a camera. It was on the corner of Bloomfield and Artesia. I was on Bloomfield, turning left into Artesia. That was the Friday that Susan, Jason, Eric, Susan's cousin, and some other people (I think?) went to see I, Robot. I was gonna go, and then I didn't. I should've gone, then I never would've ran over that red light. All the time, I was thinking I made the right choice in not going, I was wrong. That night, I felt like crap because I found out that that movie was good and my friends had seemed to have a good time. I hate missing out on stuff... and then I was really depressed for the rest of the weekend... it just seemed to be getting worse and worse.    Anyway, it's a $340 charge. They mailed it to us and it has pictures that were so clear and so specific. God, I hate rich Cerritos. This would've never happened in Norwalk. I wasn't home when my mom opened the letter, but she told me that she was really angry. By the time I came home, she was more calm. But anyway, ever since I got it, I feel so fucking depressed. I feel like I let my family down. I mean, $340 is a lot of fucking money. I could buy a playstation 2 and like 4 games. I feel like such a fucking failure. This $340 billing represents who I've become. I'm so reckless and I hate it. I'm like this with everything. I just don't seem to care anymore. I hate the attitude I have about everything, it's fucked up, and it's my own damn fault.    We were going to go to DDR competition, Melinda, Susan, and I, because DDR is fun, and it would be cool if I could kick someone's butt at it, but we'd have to drive all the way to Burbank, I think it's about 45 minutes away. And I'm so fucking scared to go on the freeway. Lately, I'm so doubtful of myself. I don't trust myself to go on the freeway. You would think that if I got into a car accident, I would be scared to get back on the road, but that's not what happened...    I did get into a minor accident in the parking lot when I first started out driving. I was supposed to park the car, and I was in the car by myself. I couldn't seem to park correctly and when I saw that there was a car in front of me, I started to panic because I felt like I needed to do this fast. I was taking up too much time. In my state of panic, I backed up the car, and a bit too fast, because I bumped into a car in back of me.    However, that never scared me into not driving again. I think it's funny how this one little ticket could cause me so much more damage than an actual accident. Maybe it's the thought that I could've been in one really scares me this time. I don't know. I just know that I'm sick with guilt from all this and I don' t know how to stop. I wish I could stop feeling like a failure.    My mom has been a bitch lately, which I'm not surprised at because of that ticket. I guess she has good reason to be mad at me, but when she gets mad at me, she brings everything that's happened in the past and just keeps adding on... and the more she says, the worse it gets and it almost seems as if she's yelling at me because I have sex, do drugs and get invovled in murders or something. I don't need her to tell me any of this. Doesn't she know that I feel fucking bad as it is that I got a ticket? She's always said that I'm like a log. I don't give any response whatsoever. I guess that's true, but I do have feelings, but I could never open up and share that with my mom. I guess because, if I did, then she would expect things from me, and I don't know if I could come through... and if I didn't, I couldn't bare disappointing her like that.    I went out to the mall today with Susan and Melinda. I was only going to go with Susan, but when Susan said she was coming to ROP class, I knew Melinda would want to come along too. And of course, Susan is really nice, so why wouldn't she let her come? I just totally felt like Melinda butted in into our mall day, but I don't know, whatever... I figured this would happen anyway. By the end of the day, while we were walking out of the mall, I felt like a third wheel. I feel like this a lot - that I don't belong with the people I hang out with. I mean, if it was only Susan and I, I would not feel this way, because you can't be a third wheel when there's only 2 people. I guess, if I really cared about Melinda coming along, I would've told Susan that I would pick her up at her house, but since I didn't, I guess I didn't care all that much. I'm beyond caring, I guess... which brings me to...   Lately, I have not cared about anything. Thinking about anything just makes me want to fucking cry, I don't want to think anymore, but I can't avoid thinking, because there's just so much that I have to work and plan out. I wish I didn't feel this way. And if even Chris would sign on, I could perhaps even talk to him, even though we haven't talked in a long time. I'm a little worried about him since I found out he got charged for arson. I guess, things could be worse then? I really wish that I could talk to him... or someone.    I have no fervor for anything anymore. I'm not interested in cosplay for AX, DDR... hanging out with friends, movies... not even cute guys or Court (not that I ever thought about Court much... but yeah). I just wish I had someone to talk to...    There's only one more month till school starts... I must get my act together...

      This blog was totally random and totally a spur of the moment thing. I only did it cause I saw Susan's blogger. This makes the 6th diary I have. In total, I have:  >> ******** - the most significant and most important one. I've had this for over 2 years and it's very in dept about everything that I've dealt with and felt. >> ********** - a secret diary that nobody has the password to. I do not write in it much... actually, I only write in it when I can't write about it in ********. >> attente - it's a french diary, with translations in English. I'm willing to give out this link, if you want it... but only to certain people that I really trust or I haven't mentioned. The entries on this diary are mostly about guys... entries are very short, and not very comprehensive. >> creativitly - poems and songs that I've written. This is open to all. >> darkangelz5 - this is very public because I think everyone that I know in person and I hang out with has the link to this one, so I don't open up feelings in there. This diary is opened up to everyone as well.  If you would like to know the URL for any of these diaries, please ask me. With the exception of the first two, I could give you the URL to the others.  This is what I hope to accomplish with this blog: to open up myself more than I did on xanga, so people could really see what I am like. I hate the fact that I couldn't open on xanga, so I'm going to try it here.

      Yesterday, I went to Nickle Nickle with some people, where we just hung out and stuff. Afterwards, drove some people to Fullerton to get Andrew (Rick's brother) a birthday gift. Though, now that I look back, it's kinda dumb, because none of us ended up going to the party. :( I think I may have ran over a red light. I am hoping that I didn't. Susan is confident that I passed the intersection, and to be honest, I am pretty sure that I passed too. I kind of remember reacting to the red light, during the middle of the intersection. Please, I hope that I didn't get a ticket. Everytime I think about the possibility that I might have gotten one... it just depresses me so much. :( But I try to be logical about it and well, I don't think I got one then, but it's hard not to panic.  SAT classes are going pretty well. I'm dying to know what I got on my practice test that I took Thursday. I really hoped that they've improved. If they haven't... I guess I'll have to work harder. >  I am worried for Eric and he's leg. I talked to him today and it seems like we're okay now. I don't think he's mad at me anymore, so that's a good thing. I really feel bad for Eric... but I don't know at all how to express my sympathy for him. I wish I was better at cheering people up. *sigh* Pray for him... that he won't be in pain... and me, so that I won't get that ticket.

      I always loved this song since I first heard it, but I guess I never thought much of it until today. I heard this song while I was drying my hair at the gym, because I went swimming, and I did some laps.  Iris is the goddess of the rainbow and the messengers of the gods. Did you know that?  As I was listening to this song, I realized how much it reminded me of ****.  And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies And you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am ---Goo Goo Dolls  The surprising thing was... he called me today. Actually, he called me last Tuesday too. Today he told me that he called me just because he felt the need to tell me that he loves me still. I told him I do too, but if he could see how much I really missed him... well, then maybe he would say he missed me too, because it seems like that's what he was trying to say, but I know better. Nothing between us will work out. They never do and I'm tired of that kind of pain. I just wish that my heart would listen... cause if it did, I wouldn't think about him as much as I do.

      I haven't written lately because nothing much has happened, with my classes and all. Today, I had to take a SAT I, and two SAT II practice exams. That's 5 hours and thirty minutes of straight testing. :( By the end, I had a massive headache, so I know I did badly on my SAT IIC math, which was the last section I did. I also ended up with a stomach ache too, because I didn't eat so late in the day. I tell you, that was one of the worst stomach ahes I've ever gotten. It's never gotten that bad before. :(  Anyway, since I've got nothing much to say, here are a couple of dreams I've had this week. First one is geeky, second one is scary.  The first one: I had a dream about Jason Behr. It was so weird, made no sense. First, i remember being in a parking lot and he tells me that his spine broke (he's supposed to be an alien) and he's holding this wire and that was suppoed to be the spine. That sounds ridiculous, but you know how dreams are. So we're walking along and then we go into this hideout place. He led me to this apartment building or something and there was a room on the first floor that was cleverly hidden. So we go in and I said "oh... so is this where you've been hiding? It's a pretty safe spot... never would've thought of it." And then this little girl comes, she looks about 4 or 5, I think, but I think she was supposed to be 3. And then it's weird, because I say "wow, she's grown from when I last remember her" and it felt like I came from the past cause I last saw her as a baby. I don't even know who she is, some random child, I think. And then I found out that Jason Behr and I broke up in the future, or will break up in the future; it's so confusing. I think I was playing Liz Parker, but it's unconfirmed, and then Max (I called him Max in the dream) goes into this room, and he's lying on the sofa, or couch. And then I had to go. It was weird, because I kept thinking about my SAT classes and how I was gonna be late even though it was like 5pm in the afternoon (in the dream) and I kept thinking that I was gonna be late for that... but then I was also trying to recall the actual SAT class, and I couldn't remember (duh cause I didn't go yet), so I figured I needed to go, that I was late... very confusing.  Anyway, I told him I was gonna go and he asks for a kiss. The kisses were very hesitant, because I was reluctant about it. And then, he says to me "I'm glad I know where you're going because it always bothered me when you left and never said where you were headed..." For some reason, even though he didn't explain it to me, I knew how he knew where I was and that was because he saw the future and he knew what happened or something. Confusing... again. Then somehow, I knew the past too, because I knew what he was thinking... i don't know how, but yeah, and I said "I'm not going to doctor's appointment" and then I forget what happens after that.  The next thing I remember is that I was crying, really crazy, asking why we broke up. I think he was crying too. He either said "I don't know" or "I don't remember" and then I stopped crying, and I said, "we'll find out online" So I clicked on this Roswell TV show site and just as I was about to find out how we broke up, I woke up. You know what's weird? Max told me to type in maxim.com and then I did, and this chinese writing stuff came on.  The second dream: It was unlike any that I've ever had a dream about. It kind of reminded me of The Exorcist actually. It started out kinda normal... well compared to the rest of the dream it was. I was inside this video game with my brother. There was this ship that was frozen on the side of the shore. It was nighttime and it was freezing. I know so because the sea had turned into ice. Somehow, we managed to kick the ship and it floated and cracked the ice, until it drifted a little outward.  We went inside... and it didn't seem like we were in a ship, it looked like we were inside a house. The house also had long stairs which ended in dead ends (a motif in all my nightmare-ish dreams). We left the "home" and went out a door to find that we were surrounded by a market place. I don't remember what happens after that, but by then I had these powers, and they were really strong shit too. Scary as hell. I was about to leave because I heard my dad calling me, but before I left I had to check up on these caged things...   Now first, these cages, they were really small, and I swear that when I was looking through each one, I was scrolling down. On the first row, it was my siblings... however, they weren't really my siblings, because they were all about my age. The first one was the oldest, though I don't know if she was older than me, but it seemed like it. Then, it was a boy. He was younger, but looked about my age. The last girl, in the last cell, looked about 13. As I scrolled down I saw a dog cage and I knew the dog's name. It was something like Soto, I forget now, but it was written on the cage. Then I had a flashback of the dog attacking feverishly at this mat... it looked kinda like a mat on a chair maybe? But yeah, because of that, I didn't want to free the dog.   Then I encountered this doll on the lower cage. This doll was really scratched up and beaten. It was scarred everywhere. I was creeped out, so I put it back, and then, my oldest "sister" awokened. She somehow got out of the cage so I used my powers to get her wrist chained to the ceiling, now and then I saw her trying to break loose... her vains looked like they were bursting from her skin, so I used my powers and said that they were the strongest metal, so she wouldn't be able to break it, and then she gave up.   Somehow, some other people came into the room and this black guy comes up to me and said he's looking for someone to fuck. And I ask my sister if she's up for it. She says yes. And then I tell her, "if dad comes and sees this, it's gonna be totally your fault." She says ok. Then I tell her something like I was going to send her downstairs (with my powers) and that they would automatically reappear back in the room in 10 mins, so if dad sees, it wouldn't be my fault. Then the whole cage, my sister and that black seemed to have slowly disappeared. When they reappeared again, which seemed like a split second, my sister was free from the chains. They were on this counter and she was on top of them. Oddly enough, she had clothes on. I don't remember about the black guy, because next thing you know, she throws the guy against the wall... and then he's this most hideous thing you've ever seen. Most of his body was drenched in blood, and his face was so gruesome. The bottom of his face looked like... it looked like my sister took a big bite of it, so there was a hole. His cheeks, mouth and chin were missing. At first it didn't register what I was seeing, so I wasn't grossed out, but then when I did, I noticed that he was still alive. I think he was talking about (I don't know how since his mouth is gone...) how he was gonna turn to something evil and then, I was freaked out, so I used my powers and said, "he has no soul, and if he has no soul, then he's dead." And then the black guy blew up into little pieces that then turned to oblivion.   Then, I noticed that my brother, the non real, about my age one, turned towards this flimsy, fragile girl. As he was about to kiss her, she grew extra lips on her forehead. I looked at the shadow, and it looked like the lips on the forehead had really sharp teeth and she was about to bite him. And then next thing you know, my sister walks toward me to  urlLink cow  (haha SAT word!) me. She mentioned that those powers weren't mine and they only became mine because I killed somebody or someone gave it to me, or something... I forgot, but in the dream, I knew what she said was true. I got scared, because then, I tried to use my powers to force her back, but it didn't work. And then I noticed that a bunch of people were comining near me and I told them all to back away, but they didn't. And I said it louder, and a few of them got sent back, but not all... and that's all I remember, because then I woke up.

      I realized something when I woke up today - I forgive really easily. I guess the reasoning behind this is that, why should I hold a grudge against someone? Why waste my time like that? Life is too short for things like that. It gets pretty bad too. What I mean by this is that even though one of the worst things possible happened to me, I forgave within a couple of days.  I'm not sure that I am ready to tell you what it is, because it would really give a huge chunk of the deepest part of my life away. Let's just say that a friend of mine backstabbed me with a guy I liked, and this guy I liked, well, we liked each other and my friend knew... but she still did that anyway. I was never as sad as I thought I should've been. I was never as angry as I should've been. I just let it go. From the second I heard about it, I didn't even try, I just gave up. I'm not sure if I've always been that forgiving, or if I started at that moment. But ever since then, I don't get mad. I only temporarily get pissed. I do not hold my anger in, I do not keep grudges. I let you know how I feel. I don't believe in keeping it to myself. Why should I bottle my feelings inside, and let it eat at me, when it's the other person's fault?  That's why I'm so mad at Eric for not telling me. I thought he knew me better than that, but he doesn't. And maybe I shouldn't be angry because, I'm turning it around and making it into about me, even though it was about him, but I can't help how I feel. I would tell Eric how I feel about it, but I think it would only get him more angry, and in the end, what my friends feel always seems to be more important than anything about me. And that's really sad, because I don't think anyone could ever show me that kind of appreciation (especially not Eric, I think), and yet I keep doing it anyway. And then I tell myself, that there's no point in being angry. It's stupid, so then I forget it all for just awhile.  I wonder if people know this about me... that I don't get mad very much, and I forgive easily. I'm sure if someone did, they could walk all over me... if they haven't already. Sometimes I think that a lot of people do, but I just never realize it. Sometimes, I think I've changed, but I haven't at all. There is a side of me that hasn't changed at all. There is a side of me, that still remains who I was when I was friends with Nancy, but most of the time, I hate that girl, so I've changed because of it, but she comes back. I know she does, otherwise, I wouldn't be as nice as I am sometimes. And even though I'll make some mean comments now and then, people that know me, know that I am a softie at heart, and I have a soft spot for my friends.

      Today started off pretty good. It looked promising. I had a long chat with mom about our relationship and things like that. Every time she pointed out something, I had to look up to keep from crying, because she asked me these questions that just hurt so much to answer, because they were all true, and I think she finally knew.  The dance was pretty cool. I had a pretty okay time.  Then Gautam came to pick us up, and then Gautam seemed to be his usual self, but I noticed that lately I was getting bad vibes from Eric, and it turns out that he was mad at me about something from a week ago. I wish people would tell me these thing when they are wrong. Now, I feel fucking depressed. I want to cry... because I feel like a fucking failure again. I thought that people understood me. Eric said that he was too angry that day and shouldn't have told me... well, then he could've at least fucking told me the next day... instead of waiting till now... after I asked him. Now, I feel like a fucking idiot. I feel so dumb. I guess maybe if it wasn't Eric, it would be someone else that would tip me off into a brawl. I just want to cry. I'm so sick of everything and I feel like I'm under so much pressure. Once again, I feel like I fucking failed something. I fail at everything I do.

      I got into a fender bender today, or rather the other person that hit me got into one. It was scary. The bastard that hit me ran off. I don't feel like talking about the details, so I'll leave it at that, unless someone really wants to know. I almost got into an accident while merging on the freeway... gah... today was horrible, kinda like last Saturday actually.  I've been too envolved in my own problems lately to really care or notice anyone else's. That's what happens when you have problems I guess, you don't notice other people's. I think I may have caused someone grief and for that I'm sorry. I guess I was kind of angry and took it out on this person. *Sigh* Well, I feel much better about everything now and the anger is relent.  Here's one thing that I have thought of in the past week though... I think I rush into things. I think I become too close with people too fast, and I end up getting hurt a lot, and I usually hurt the other person too, and ultimately, that hurts me. I can already name a couple of people at the top of my head that this has already happened. I'm going to try not to open up anymore and just go with the flow. I'm going to try really hard to be more easy going. I don't like being serious all the time. And I'm not going to care... after this year, I won't even be around anymore, what's the point of caring?  I said that I would keep in touch with the seniors from this year, that we would hang out this summer and all that, but I haven't really tried. I thought I was going to watch a movie with some of them, but I found out that they already went without me. It figures. I'm not angry, just disappointed at the truth. It sucks that things had to end up this way, but I've got to just admit it, this is life. People are gonna come and go, so no more anger... I don't care what happens. In a year, none of this matters. I'll just sit back and see what happens... maybe things won't be so bad then.

      Hey...yea... Will I close my eyes? Will I hold my breath? Will I wanna cry? Will our souls connect? I've been thinking about it When I go to bed At night I wonder (wonder)  Will you hold my hand? Will you speak a vow? Will the stars be shining in the sky above? Will it be all I've been dreamin of? For so long, holding on?  Our first kiss won't be the last Our love's too deep to end that fast And good things come to those who have to wait I believe it's only time that keeps us from the thing divine And when it's here ya know I’m gonna say (lay it on my lips)  Will it taste like candy? Will it be that sweet? Will our hearts be racing to a heavenly beat? Will the moment sweep me off my feet? And draw me under (under)  Will I tremble (tremble)? Will I beg for more? Will it be like anything I never felt before? Will we be down for a little more? One thing I I know for sure...  CHOROUS  I can picture it all Inside my head Just how it's going to be But a girl can only dream so much Now she wants to make it real (make it real) --International Five  I saw  The Prince and Me  today... ending sucked, didn't like it, but the guy, Luke Mably, totally hot. And his accent... gah, hits me right in the heart. I'm a sucker for accents.   urlLink    click on pic for a closer look.  Also saw  13 Going on 30 . I didn't like that one either, ending was blech.  Life's been tough, but I'm tougher. I've come around, so if you're worried about me, don't. Don't waste your time of feelings on me. I'll come to you if I need it and if I don't come to you, maybe it's not that I don't need you, but I want to spare you my feelings.  One more year, and that's fucking scary. I get knots in my stomach thinking about it, but I am sick of this place, I won't lie.

      Well, yes I am still worried about the ticket, but I have been feeling better because I've been talking to someone kind of unexpected lately. I'm going to call him Kurk, for the sake that, I just don't want to reveal his name. I felt like I got betrayed by one of my friends lately, and maybe even 2. After what happened with Eric, I thought maybe things would look up... but it hasn't. Everything has been so fucking wrong and I'm just dying to hear some good news from anyone, but I haven't. I would've talked about this with the friend that "betrayed" me, but... well, if this person betrayed me, why would I talk to him/her? Anyway, this person didn't really betray me, I just feel that way. *sigh* Instead, I'm talking about it with Kurk, which makes me feel better, because I need to talk about it with someone. I made all these bunches of new friends this year, and I thought that I could turn to them, but I was wrong, it's those that are now closest to us, that can hurt us the most. With everything going on in my head, and the things I'm feeling, I just don't care about other people right now. Well, except Kurk's problems. I guess, cause he's listening to me.  My mom got a phone call from my cousin (on her side). Her name is Yang-Shung (I think that's how you spell it). Yang-Shung is my oldest cousin, and she has her own family, including a baby boy, who's now 3. My only other cousin from my mom's side is Ling-Ling. She's younger, but she also has a family and a baby girl, who's about 1. Yang-Shung told my mother about the lifestyle that Ling-Ling was living, who then later told me. You see, out of my cousins (I only have one other cousin who's still a baby (from my dad's side) so yeah...), I'm kind of like the last chance in the family to go to a good school (excluding my brother, because he's a boy and the rest of us are girls). Yang-Shung's mom died when it was a critical time in her life... She was about 13 or so, and because her mom got cancer, all the attention was focused on her mom and she had nobody left... nobody that took care of her. She slowly built ties with this boy at school and began dating him, secretly. Her grades dropped (well they had since her mom was dying, but it got worse)... and her life just really sucked from then on. She didn't end up marrying him, even though she still loved him. I'm not very close with her, but I'm sure that even now, she still thinks about the guy she could've been with...  Ling-Ling was a completely different story. She started skipping classes in middle school to go clubbing and dancing. She never even finished middle school... well, she did later, with make up classes. I was really close to Ling-Ling when I was younger. She was always smiling and had a positive influence on me. I did not learn about her destructive past until I went to China last summer, when my mom told me. I'd never have guess that she's gotten that bad. Ling-Ling was always kind of a role model in the back of my head... Well, she ended up going to Ireland, where she met her husband, Chris. I've met Chris, and there's something about him that I really can't stand... I can't quite put my finger on it. Anyway, Ling-Ling came back with her husband and they're living with Ling-Ling's parents. Maybe that's not such a bad thing, because if that was the worst part, I wouldn't feel shameful for her. But the thing is... Ling-Ling doesn't work, only Chris. Chris teaches at some international language school. Ling-Ling claims that she doesn't work because she wouldn't earn much money (which is true). Chris earns a hell of a lot more money than she would, but she should still work... but anyway. What happens is that, Chris only works about 3 times a week now, mostly afternoon classes. Ling-Ling and Chris get up around 1pm or so and then shower and eat and then while Chris goes to work Ling-Ling is out doing who knows what, because they always come home together at night. After eating dinner, they go on the computer for the reminder of the night, till about 2am or so and then they go to sleep.  If Ling-Ling doesn't work, at least she could watch her own child... but her mom is always taking care of her. Ling-Ling doesn't act like a mother at all. My mom told me that the baby keeps getting colds and stuff and Ling-Ling is blaming it on her mom because she doesn't take care of her baby well enough or something. That's not only impudent, but it's just fucking messed up! If she's got a problem with it, she should take care of her own child, that's what she should be doing anyway. Fuck, she's a horrible mother and I feel sorry for my niece. I'm sorry I had to say that, but that's how I feel.  It makes me wonder how I will turn out in a few years. Fuck... if I turn out anything like my cousin, the least I could do, is not bring a child into the world.

      I can't get the possibility of having that ticket out of my head. It's driving (haha) me insane! I just wish I knew if I got one or not, so I wouldn't have to deal with the possibility of getting one. Everytime I think about it, I just want to cry. I get so frustrated with myself. I try to slowly convince myself of it, but it comes back after awhile. I can't seem to concentration on any SAT work I'm doing. I just keep thinking about it, and keep thinking about it, and my head really hurts. I don't want to think about it anymore, but it keeps coming back to scare me. Just tell me if I got a fucking ticket or not already! I don't care if I get one now (actually, I do, but...), I just want to know what I need to deal with!

      Sometimes I feel like I have no idea what's going on in my friend's lives and then I feel left out. Am I supposed to ask "what's up?" in order to know what's going on in someone's life? I thought that friends would instinctively tell you. I suppose that it depends on how well you know someone then. I think maybe it's time I stop trying to talk to people then. Maybe it's best for now if I'm more seclusive.  I have been reading transcripts from old Roswell epsiodes ever since my dream, about 5 days ago. Here's a scene that I really liked.  (Max and Liz are running down a dark street)  LIZ: Max! Max, please. We have to stop. Please, we have to stop.  MAX: Let's just keep running, you and me, away from here, away from everything. I see everything so clearly now. We'll go someplace where no one knows us. As long as we're together, nothing else matters.  LIZ: You're drunk. Nothing that you're saying is true.  MAX: It's all true, Liz. It's how I really feel. It's all just magic when I think about you.  (Max touches a lamp post and causes the light to shine in a pattern)  LIZ: Max, turn it off. Anyone can see.  MAX: And when I'm not with you...I go crazy.  (Max touches a car and the car alarm goes off)  LIZ: Max.  MAX: When you're here...  LIZ: Oh, Max. Please.  MAX: You're my dream girl, Liz.  LIZ: And what if I believe you tonight?  MAX: Then we live happily ever after.  LIZ: And then what about tomorrow...when you go back to realizing who you really are, and all of your fantasies go away.  MAX: I'll still have you.  LIZ: This can never be normal, Max.  (Max touches the tops of some parking meters, and they start sparkling)  MAX: What's so great about normal?  Call me a dreamer or a romantic, I guess, but that's what I've always been. Sometimes I wish I had a crazy life like that to make things more interesting. And sometimes I really do wonder why life can't be like TV shows, where I gain some kind of wacky power, like Charmed, or if I knew Clark Kent, or even have a good relationship with my mom like in Gilmore Girls. I've always had a continuing obsession over the unnatural.  Now, I wish I had paid more attention to Roswell... I remember that I even used to have this little mini poster of them in my room... I wish I didn't take things for granted. Now, I don't think any channel even plays Roswell. It might be played on cable, but I doubt it. What's the use though? I don't have cable. Perhaps in a few years, I will even miss Buffy the vampire slayer, even though I was never really into that. Even though Charmed is on today, I don't like it as much. You can tell the show has lost it's touch. The plots seem kind of repititious and to be honest, I would much rather watch an old episode from the first few seasons with Prue and Andy (from the first season). Which makes me realize that in a few years when Tru Calling is going to be gone, I will probably miss that show too. Now, I wished that I had recorded episodes of Roswell... because I've seen most of the first season. When I'm reading the transcripts, I remember the scenes. If I recorded Tru Calling, I wouldn't miss it in the future.  All I have left is everything I remember, that and a few episodes of Charmed that I recorded some years ago. When you think of all the TV shows that's come and by, sometimes you're amazed to find that you forgot they even existed, and you forgot that you even cared. That's life, I guess.

      I want to talk to someone that understands. I want to talk to someone who would or could be able to help me, but nobody can. Everything seems at an all time low for me and conflicts with friends are arising. My new perspective won't work this way, not if I keep feeling angry. I'm just so angry at everyone lately, all for different reasons. Some, I'm not exactly sure why the resentment, but either way, I can't really seem to stand anyone.  I tried to talk to someone earlier and he/she didn't make me feel better. I think he/she was trying to make me laugh, but it only made me angry that he/she didn't take the situation seriously. I know he/she meant well, but it pissed me off. If you think it's you, don't worry about it, I'll be over it... I'm angry at everyone, remember?  To simply state this... I fucking hate everybody right now and maybe I thought that one person could make me feel better, let me down... Another person that I wish I could talk to... I just can't reach to him, as much as I want to.  I just want to fucking go in the corner and cry, because I hate living. I want to fucking die.  Here's a quiz to lighten the mood (bolded parts are things I think are true; question marks are unsure):  FEBRUARY: Abstract thoughts. Loves reality and  abstract . Intelligent and clever.  Changing personality . Attractive. Sexy.  Temperamental . Quiet, shy and humble(?).  Honest and loyal .  Determined to reach goals . Loves freedom(?).  Rebellious when restricted . Loves aggressiveness.  Too sensitive and easily hurt .  Gets angry really easily  but thoes not show it(?). Dislike unnecessary things. Loves making friends(?) but rarely shows it. Daring and stubborn.  Ambitious . Realizing dreams and hopes. Sharp.  Loves entertainment and leisure.   Romantic on the inside  not outside.  Superstitious and ludicrous.  Spendthrift(sometimes).  Tries to learn to show emotions.    urlLink What does your birth month say about you?  brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   Oh yeah, I won't be writing in here for awhile. I'll come back when I'm feeling better. No need to exacerbate the situation, right? Same goes for AIM, I'll be back when I feel better... unless I need to talk to someone...
