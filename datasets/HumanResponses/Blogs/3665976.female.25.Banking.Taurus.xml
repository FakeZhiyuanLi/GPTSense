      看了一部滿感人的電影、這是我第一次走進柏斯的電影院。  來柏斯一年一個月了、感覺空蕩蕩的。在這期間當然充斥著許多的變化、可是對我卻是飄渺虛幻的。我怎麼當初會有這麼樣的決定、單身一個人就一股勁的來到這。真想不通。或許在某個角落我給了自己一個解釋一個理由、所以我離開了家。  回想剛來這的日子、我真不知道自己是怎麼走過來的。可是當時真的很快樂。當然現在也不差、可是周遭的變化讓我回頭一看、直冒冷汗、一步也不敢停。我不能退、不可以停也不可以頓。我的天、現實在追趕著我。我有一大堆的條例在等著我背、有一大堆的工作積在床頭、而我還在爭取時間規劃下一步該怎麼做。真可惡。  我該從哪開始？  可是想想當別人還在十字路口徘徊的現在、對於我只是要不要打開書本、就覺得慶幸、嘻嘻。我想我爸媽到現在應該還摸不著頭腦、為什麼我當初那麼堅持的要繼續唸書。連我也沒有答案的問題我希望有一天我會頓悟。  我很少打電話回家、因為覺得家裡應該不會須要我。我在搜尋自己、一個真正的自己… 	 在這裡、我看到了許多不同於我的故事。真真正正的人生百態。我看見了生老病死、體會到原來在家以外的、是那麼樣的驚心動魄。我不能進入一個那麼殘酷的世界裡、即使現在我碰到了我前所未見的人生也一直是個旁觀者。冥冥之中我們的命運都被安排好了、我是屬於比較幸運的。  == ^ ^ == ^ ^ == == ^ ^ == == ^ ^ == == ^ ^ ==  飛行了五個小時、我從小窗口看見了萬家燈火、我感受不到一點溫暖、我沒有輕嘆只有淡淡的憂傷… 請代我告訴他、我到了。  坐在小巴士裡、看見許許多多的白色平房、只有白色沒有彩色、人煙希少、也許是入夜了、我在試圖找尋著什麼。我有點冷﹏  沒有人知道我下飛機後會有什麼接踵而至。到今天也沒有人問過我。     真不曉得我是如何走過來的。應該在我身邊的都不在、看看天空、他在那裡？距離我十萬八千里。永遠學不會東南西北、所以繞了一圈、想著他在哪個方向。  從那以後、我討厭這裡的天空。  四天後、我終於打電話回家、耳邊傳來竟是我姐的叫罵聲。你都不知道人家會擔心嗎？竟然四天才打電話回家…我靜靜的挨罵、突然電話那頭傳出了我母親的聲音。這時的我已不自覺的流下了眼淚。好遠︸ 家距離我好遠啊！

      All alone I have started my journey  To the darkness of darkness I go  With a reason, I stopped for a moment  In this world full of pleasure so frail  Town after town on I travel  Pass through faces I know and know not  Like a bird in flight, sometimes I topple  Time and time again, just farewells   Day by day,my story unfolds  All alone as the day I was born  Till your eyes rest in mine,I shall wander  No more darkness I know and know not  For your sweetness I traded my freedom  Not knowing a farewell awaits   You know, hearts can be repeatedly broken  Making room for the harrows to came  Along with my sorrows I buried  My tears, my smiles, your name   Songs of lovetales I sing of no more  Once again with my shadows I roam  I love you All alone as the day I was born  I love you Still alone with my shadows I roam

      一封信、一件舊的毛線衣、誰是誰的紀念品、拿什麼來回憶？  一場雨狠狠下在眼睛裡~ 已經都沒關係  問自己、沒有你我行不行、顯微鏡裡看愛情、我慢慢看仔細  遇見你、之後愛上你、然後恨透你、原來愛是回不去的旅行。  親愛的、讓我忘記你~

        I'm sorry I didn't mean to call but I couldn't fight it I guess I was weak and couldn't even hide it and so I surrender just to hear your voice I know how many times I said I'm gonna to live with out you and maybe someone else is standing there beside you but there's something baby that you need to know that deep inside me I feel like I'm dying I have to see you it's all that I'm asking. Vida, give me back my fantasies the courage that I need to live the air that I breathe carino mio, my world becomes so empty my day's are so cold and lonely and each night I taste the purest of pain. I wish I could tell you I'm feeling better every day that it didn't hurt me when you walked away but to tell you the truth I can't find my way and deep inside me I feel like I'm dying I have to see you it's all that I'm asking
