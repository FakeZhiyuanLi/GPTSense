      Valuable advice:   "That is goal obsession, which is a subset of wanting to win too much. It rears its ugly head in many ways. In its broadest form, it's the force at play when we get so wrapped up in achieving our goal that we do it at the expense of a larger mission."   urlLink Fast Company Goal 1 Mission 0   Solution:  "The solution is simple, but not easy. You have to step back, take a breath, and look around. Survey the conditions that are making you obsessed with the wrong goals. Time and deadline pressures come with being a leader. We confront them every minute of every day. They do not go away. Which makes it all the more important to reflect upon our work, match it up against the life we want to live, and consider, "What am I doing?" and "Why am I doing this?" Ask yourself, "Am I achieving a task and forgetting my organization's mission? Am I making money to support my family -- and forgetting the family that I am trying to support?""

      Something we constantly forget is that data quality plays a key role in integration with SOA due to:  "Because SOAs emphasize loosely coupled interactions between services, they must move data from one service to another with enough context, quality, and syntactic structure to allow services to perform their tasks independently of any other. Each service must ensure that inbound and outbound data is not only syntactically correct, but also is valid and complete in the context of the business application being performed."   urlLink Enterprise Architect - SOA's Achilles Heel
