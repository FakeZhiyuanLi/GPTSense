      what's the point of me trying anymore.  i really do think i should just give up.  obviously me doing my best to be with you isn't working.  i know you probably are annoyed with me and wish i would just go away.  it is so hard to go one day and not see your face.  that is how much i love you.  i am not talking about the serious love stuff just love like a friendship type of love.  your smile and your eyes just make me like you more but i should just give up and stop fighting myself.  sometimes you make me wish i was dead and sometimes you make me happy i am alive.  most of the time i don't know what to think.  well i guess all i can say is what's the point of ding what i do to myself and putting myself through what i put myself through?  if you have an answer leave me a comment. please.

      ok if you lived like you were dyign you wouldn't be afraid to do the things you are scared to do.  i would actually be able to tell someone i loved them.  or i could jump off a bridge.  or i could actually talk to a midget and not be afrid of it killing me or even a clown for the matter.  i could fly with the birds.  to live everyday like there was no tomorrow would be so cool.  i really wish i could.  then i would take chances worth taking instead of waiting around for someone to tell me what to do.  even when people tell me to do something i don't listen to them.  i always dwell on the past.  guess what i did something adventurous the other day (maybe it isn't to you but it is to me)  i actually was on something high off the ground.  i was so proud of myself.  i don't think that i am scared of heights anymore.  i don't think i have to worry that everytime i am up somewhere high i could fall and in some crazy way hang myself. (don't ask it is a long story)

      ok last night manny, courtney, nate, heather, kelly, shannon, maggie, keith, caleb, katie, dirk, bob, nate, matt, and all went to the drive-in.  kelly and i decide to joke around with dirk and tell him that shannon wants him to kiss her in front of everyone.  well i guess dirk didn't get the hint that we were joking.  he actually was going to try to kiss her.  then he realizes we were lying to him. at intermission dirk decided he was going to yell at me and only me about it.  he made me feel like shit and the biggest bitch of all.  i know it was mean but we were joking.  he is trying to get with shannon, but shannon doesn't have feelings for him anymore so i think he should just move on.  it would be for the best.

      ok i think i am falling for someone all over again.  i thought i might be over him but i know i was wrong.  i tried so hard to get over him but it never works.  he sucks so bad.  he just makes me like him more and more everytime we hang out.  maybe we should stop hanging out.  i dunno.  i love his smile.  i have a thing about smiles and ears.  and i like both of his.  i thought i was falling for someone else as well but he told me to forget about him and just keep liking the original person.  he doesn't think i could ever like him.

      guys are so confusing.  first they tell you you need to get over the guy you liked and think more about them.  then they turn everything around and say no go back and try to get with the guy you just got over. what is the point of even trying.  there isn't one.  i think a girl should just sit around and wait to die a long, painful, and lonely death.

      everyone tells me that my life isn't that bad.  how would you know you haven't lived it.  who are you to judge if someone has had a bad life.  my parents may still be together and i may still have all my grandparents but how does that seperate a good life from a bad one.  i have gone through a lot.  between my brother and my sister ignoring my practically my whole life, the guys i like always liking my sister, and all the trouble i have had with guys it has been pretty bad.  i will admit that i have thought/tried to commit suicide before but obviously since i am writing this i didn't accomplish my goal.  i figure that i have a life a head of me and maybe it can get better.  there was also these two people who helped me through a lot of that and i thank them from the bottom of my "little" heart.  Courtney you were always there to talk to me and stop me from thinking such bad things about myself.  you always boosted my self-esteem.  I love you so much and i know that i have helped you in return.  Manny you have also helped me.  when i use to talk about it and say that if i did go through with it you would always be the one to say there are people who would miss me and that you are my friend and you would miss me.  it is scary when you stand on the top of something at an amusement park and wish that there were no bars on the edge so you could just jump off.  i know it is scary and i shouldn't think like that but i do.  a lot of the times now a days i believe that if i were gone only a selected few would miss me.  i really hate to think like that but i do.

      i have had like some of the worst troubles with guys.  for soem reason i am attracted to jerks. if you're not mean to me and treat me like dirt, i don't like you.  this all started when i liked cade klein.  he was so mean to me at first that i fell for him.  after that it was worse.  then there was grant and max.  grant and max weren't that bad.  i actually got really close to grant.  we were like best friends my whole freshman year.   then as soon as he graduated he started going out with tara.  i don't see him hardly ever.  he doesn't even talk to me unless he is calling to talk to my brother.  max he was fun.  he was crazy.  i really really liked him.  but he didn't really like me like i liked him.  next there was brett.  at first i didn't like brett.  i just kind of used him to get to max.  that didn't last long.  i kind of fell for him.  and i also fell for manny at around the same time.  but i lost both of them to cora.  manny was going out with cora and cora was cheating on him with brett.  jeez what a whore huh?  well after that i stopped liking brett for a little while.  i couldn't stop liking manny though.  after manny went out with cora he started liking my best friend since i was born jessica.  you could tell they wanted to go out with each other and you could tell.  being the jealous person that i am i told them if they went out with each other i couldn't be either of their friends. because i didn't want to be stuck in the middle.  but then i put myself in the middle of another friends relationship.  i felt like a total b*tch.  manny then was with abbie.  i didn't and still don't have a problem with abbie (even though everyone thought i did).  manny and i use to fight all the time.  we don't as much anymore.  we just play fight a lot.  then a couple of days ago someone asked me what i would say if they asked me out.  i was so shocked and all these things ran through my head and i was dumbfounded.   i couldn't answer.  the only thing i could say was i dunno.  saying i dunno is likeeverything i am against.  i believe people should tell there true feelings and not i dunno.  that is just mean.  but all i could say was i dunno and i feel really bad now.

      i&nbsp;finally figured out why&nbsp;i like you.&nbsp; it is the little things you do to make me laugh, mad, grossed out, or just whatever.&nbsp; i mean it is the way you can make me mad in like 2 sec.&nbsp; or the way you can make me laugh with a stupid face you make or your smile.&nbsp; or the way you can gross me out when i say i have to go to the bathroom (that was really gross by the way).&nbsp; i didn't know&nbsp;what it&nbsp;was about you that is so special to me but i figured out it is the little things. (and i am not being perverted when i say little things.&nbsp; well at least i don't think i am)

      Matthew Humphrey (my color guard instructor at the Smith Wallbridge Clinic) told us that the best way to fool the audience is to make it seem like you know what you are doing when you screw up, mess up, or just don't know what to do.&nbsp; That is what I have been doing with my life for the past three years.&nbsp; Whenever something went wrong i just played it off as if it never happened.&nbsp; Like when something went/goes wrong between me and my parents I play it off.&nbsp; Yeah sometimes my parents are great.&nbsp; Yeah that is when they need me to do something or whatever but most of the time they tell me to shut up or that they don't care.&nbsp; When my brother and sister were/are mean to me I use to play as if it didn't hurt me but it tore me up.&nbsp; How do you grow up with a brother and sister hating you and not wanting you around ever.&nbsp; They you to tell me that I was a mistake and that my parents never wanted a third child.&nbsp; That is a lot to deal with when you are a teenager and having to live some of the best times of your life thinking your parents never wanted you.&nbsp; They use to tell me my mom tried to kill me when she was pregnant with me by continuing to take birth control.&nbsp; When I asked my mom about that she said she didn't know and it was an accident.&nbsp; But my mom and dad say I was a surprise and not an accident which is practically the same thing.&nbsp; Then when Grant ditched me, I pretended like I knew what I was doing and just played it off and pretended I didn't care and I still pretend I don't.&nbsp; When Cade treated me like shit I made it seem as if it hurt me for a while but it really didn't because I had already moved on.&nbsp; Max hurt me but I sometimes played that as if I didn't care and now he tries to talk to me and I act like I don't want to talk to him but I really do.&nbsp;Brett Penning,man when&nbsp;I talk about PEER PRESSURE&nbsp;&nbsp;I am talking about him.&nbsp; He has tried to pressure me into almost everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;From drinking and&nbsp;smoking to touching&nbsp;his dick.&nbsp; I played that like nothing happened also.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is just one thing&nbsp;I&nbsp;am having trouble playing off.&nbsp; That is my feelings for this one person.&nbsp; I can't hide them and I can't try to get rid of them.&nbsp; They haunt me all the time.&nbsp; &nbsp;No matter how mad I get or how much I want to just forget about you I can't.&nbsp; I say I am through but I'm not.&nbsp; I don't know what it is about you that makes you so special but there is something.&nbsp; I know you don't feel the same way about me but I have tried and tried to not feel that way for you but I can't stop.&nbsp; I think it is the little things people say that makes me keep feeling things for you.&nbsp; Like Keith saying the we are into each other which I personally don't think is true.&nbsp; People say that our eyes tell the truth.&nbsp; What some crap.&nbsp; Well I don't really know what I am saying right now I am a little mad.&nbsp;

      ok get this.  sunday i went to church and i had decided that i was going to get baptized at 4:00pm.  well between church and my baptism court-nay and i decided that we were going to go swimming and practice how we were going to get baptized.  well court-nay was climbing out of the pool and her butt was in the perfect position for me to kick it.  so of course i kicked it.  she flipped out of the pool and landed right on her boob.  i could not even move i was laughing so hard.  i almost drowned.  well we decided to get out and go tell my mom.  well we didn't want to walk through the house dripping wet so i was going to get some towels out of the dryer.  before that my dad had set a garbage bag in front of the dryer that you would have to step over to get to the dryer.  well i was stepping over it and my heel hit something.  well i looked down at my heel to see if i hyrt it and i saw something hanging on it.  at first i just thought it was a peach or a piece of food.  then i see all this red liquid building behind it and i realize i had cut a chunk of my heel.  i looked at court-nay and told her to go get my mom, dad, anyone.  well she got the closest person(my dad).  I look at my dad and was like i didn't want you but i had him look at it.  he just yelled for my mom and told her to come look at it.  my mom took one look at it and started getting sick to her stomach.  she made me sit down and then she said she had to look at it again.  well she saw it again and said lets go.  she took me to the er and they got me in right away.  my doctor was HOTT!!  he gave me six shots to numb my heel and i didn't feel any of them until he told me that he was giving me the last one.  he also told me that my heel was so hard that i broke one of his needles. it was kind of funny.   i ended up getting 12 stitches.  it hurts but it is all good.  i get them out on the 21st.  i am excited to see the scar.  i love scars.

      why do people think they have the right to tell you that you need to change.  whether it be your personality, your looks, or just you in general.  the only reason people tell you to change is because they aren't happy with theirselves.  why should you change to please someone else. the only person you need to please is yourself.  i know it is hard.  i hate everything about myself.  there is not a single thing that i like about myself.  i have the worst attitude in the world.  i live like 4 different lives to please the people i love.  i have a pretty good sense of humor but that is about it.  i hate the way i look and the way i act.  if it were up to me i wouldn't be here but i guess it is just not my time.  there is a bigger plan for me.  i wish i didn't have to change to please myself but i am not happy with being me.  i dunno just something to ponder.

      i am so tired of people toying with me.  what i mean by that is that i am sick of people playing with my emotions.  it really hurts.  it doesn't matter who you are it isn't funny anymore.  there isn't just one person specifically well maybe there is two or three but a lot of people do it.  just there are those few who do it all the time.  i am so sick of it.  a lot of the time i just want to lock myself in my room and never com out.  like anyone would care though.   well i really am tired and i am talking about sleepy tired so i am going to go.

      I serious don't know what the point of having guys on earth is.  The only thing they are good at is pissing girls off. I mean come on almost every guy I know has made me cry or really hurt me to the point that I hate them.  There is those selected few that a girl can talk to and be real good friends with but then later on you find out they are gay.  You know what bothers me is when you are such good friends with a guy and you hang out all the time and every 20 minutes you have people asking you if you are going out with him but he is STUPID and doesn't want to ruin the friendship or he just uses that as an excuse of not exactly telling you that you are an ugly fat bitch and he doesn't like you.  Stop being such a pussy and be straight up with a girl.  It is better than being dumb and avoiding it forever.  That isn't even what I am mad about.  My old friend came over today for the first time in months.  hmThe one og the first things he says to me is where's my hug.  Yea a hug is the last thing I want to give him.  After all the crap he talked about me and all the mean things he tell my brother I don't even want to hit him with a 30 foot pole.  That isn't what is really bothering me either.  It is the fact that when he was trying to talk to me he said so I hear you're going after the black guys now.  Oooooo how low can you go.  Well and then he told me one of the real reasons we took a break on our friendship which is some real bullshit.  I really don't want to talk about that.  Guys really do suck ass though.  What also pissed me off is that yesterday Manny hit me like I was a fricking guy.  I have like a million and one bruises.  What the freak was he thinking.  Like I really wanna hang out with him anytime soon.  Well I think I am done venting right now.

      have you ever noticed that people act different behind closed doors.  like pepole have a totally different personality as long as no one else is around.  it is actually really stupid.  why can you act different when it is only certain people.  what are you afraid of.  it never makes any sense.  i have been behind the doors of to many people.  what is the point of living to lives.  there isn't one.  just let the doors blow open and show people how you really feel about them or others.  stop being a coward.  just let them see the real you.

      band camp sucked so bad.  except some parts.  i kept getting ditched by heather and shannon.  they couldn't go anywhere without each other.  everytime they ditched me they left me a lone and i had to go find someone else to hang out with and that was usually either keith or blake.  i will admit i ditched them like once or twice but at least they were with each other and not alone.  that makes a big difference.  there was this one girl named lou anne from a different school there and she was so hung on blake and keith it was scary.  within the first hour of meeting the boys she had her foot all over them.  i walked up to blake and asked him why she had her leg all up on him and he said that she had a bad foot.  i was like hello i just had my stitches taken out do you see me with my leg on anybody? no.  i was like the next thing that is going to hurt is her boob are you going to hold that up for her?  then i told him or she is going to say my coochie itches will you scratch that for her too.  well that was like the highlight of my week.
