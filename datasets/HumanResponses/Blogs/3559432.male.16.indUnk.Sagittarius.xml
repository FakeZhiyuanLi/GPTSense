      Hello everyone  Friday night was a blast at the WNS? CD release show. CountMeIn played and put on an amazing show. I was so happy I could share the experience with Ang and Dana ( You 2 Rock). The night went smoothly at the show and I hung out with the 2 girls and I knew a lot of others there too. If any ones looking for tix's for the June 19th Last Class show ask me for details.  Shatterday was pretty sweet aswell that night Corey and my self hung out with the       3 tequila's which was fun to start with but then it felt like corey and I were being left out of all decisions and conversations. That night I called both Dana and Ang to explain why we were upset but then we all resovled our problems and the 5 of us are looking forward to the great friendships well have ( What a summer its going to be).   I'm off to see my baseball girls in action so hope every one had a blast of a weekend like I did and I'll talk later or call my cell  MITCH

      Hello again  The past few days have been alright with school and all. Monday  was kinda boring at school with lots of work but I just kept leaving it because I was looking forward to the evening where I would see "Harry Potter 3" with Ang, Kay, Dan, and Cor (Dan's Dana she just wanted her name to be 3 letters like the rest). We met up with the lady's at the mall and took the city bus downtown to get to the 4 o'clock show.  When we arrived we thought we would be late  so we were all running and stuff but as we approached t he cinema doors we realized the first show starts at  6 ( Thanks ANG :>)so we rush there for nothing. We had a few hours to kill so we went out for some dinner  but couldn't decide were to go because everyone had different ideas. We ended up going  to Burger King for a quick  bite. We went and got our tickets for the movie and got our seats. After many arguments we ended up sitting together but through out the movie I was bugged by the 3 stooges ( kayla , Dana, Corey) They were yelling  stuff such as "SEX" and  rubbing my neck and my legs. But the movie was only alright and then we all took the city bus back to the mall.  I arrived home to see my Favorite NHL team lose game 7 of the Stanley cup playoffs so I wasn't that happy at all ( NEXT YEAR)  Tuesday was pretty boring at school I had TEMPS all day and I feel asleep in 2 off my classes. That night I had to work and it was so boring beacuse it was so nice outside and no one else was working but DANA woo woo.   "AND THATS THE WAY THE COOKIE CRUMBLES"           LATER DAYS

      Last night was one amazing night. I went to see  "The Day After tomorrow" w/ ANGELA which turned out to be one of the top experiences of my life. She's so wicked and if you don't know her then you better because she's so amazing. The day started off when I had to work which wasn't all that bad and went by so fast. I had a good break because Lindsay from NY told me that Angela was In the mall so I called her up and I meet her at MMMMMuffins. We went to the Bank so I could take the hold off my check so that I could pay for the night and the surprise I got her. I ended up spending my whole break with her  and Dana which was really fun. But I then had to go back to the Dub to finish work. I got home 1 her 30mins early so it gave me plenty of time to get ready. I walked to her home to pick her up and I was introduced to her parents who were really nice. We then walked to bayfield 7 cinemas and along the way we talked about a lot off stuff from parents/friends/ music. When the music topic was up I thought I would give her the surprise I bought earlier in the day. I reached I not my pocket and placed it into her hand. She asked " What is it" then she opened it and was so happy and she said " I cant believe you bought me a warped tour ticket". Just the expression on her face made me so happy :>. We mad it to the movies and we chose " The Day after tomorrow". It turned out to be an alright movie and just to share the experience with her was magical. We proceeded to walk home and I learned just so much more of her personality it was great. She likes everything that I do so its pretty crazy.  I dropped her off at her house and that's how it ended with us making plans to hangout again.   I walked home and watched the rest off Game 6 Calgary vs. Tampa Bay and it ended in 2OT with a bad result( You'll Get them In 7 Calgary) I went to bed after the hockey game and entered the depths of my dreams when I was thinking of how incredible the night was.
