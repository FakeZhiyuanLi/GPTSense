       *****Movie of the Year*****     "I was stunned by the cover with Elvis and all. I bought it and watched it this movie is awesome funny as hell and the dopest one of the year." - Nick  An ancient evil finds resistance in the most unlikely of places in this oddball comedy horror effort from Phantasm director Don Coscarelli. Resting in the confines of a Mud Creek, TX, nursing home after fading into obscurity following his departure from the limelight, an aging and embittered Elvis (Bruce Campbell) befriends a delusional patient named Jack (Ossie Davis) who claims to be John F. Kennedy. It seems that at the height of his popularity Elvis had switched identities with a convincing double, and, upon the death of the substitute, missed his chance to reclaim his former fame. Despite his anger at never having made a comeback, Elvis finds a new reason to live when Jack tips him off to an evil mummy that is feasting on the souls of hapless nursing home inhabitants. Before long the geriatric duo must muster the strength to fend off the malevolent soul sucker lest they ultimately fall prey to the fearsome Bubba Ho-Tep (Bob Ivy).     Acting Rating: 9.5/10 Story Rating: 10/10 Sound/Music: 10/10  (Elvis!! of course)  Overall Rating: F@!#in 20!!!! and plenty agree

       Sorry For The Wait  I've gone awhile mainly because I was hanging wit my big sis. I've been talking around for another MC. And looking around Soundclick for one as well. And after a couple days in Alb. I had found three who just gave me a demo CD out the blue beacause they were handing them out around the city. I listened to it and they were ok. The lyrics were what I subjected too so I asked if I was to give you a beat could you make something they said sure. I thought how about the new one "look around" one of the ones that are only exclusive on my CD. And ask them too try something and they didn't like the beat. They said they're more into Southern beats. Well I gots look some more so I need an MC again but if you know someone have them contact me so I could have them flow to some beats and start my voice-over beat collection CD. Contact Me by e-mail: DJ_JEM1N1_SM1TH@hotmail.com.

       My First Mixtape: Track 5: My Favorite Ladies - MF Doom   I have this relationship with this girl Randee. We have been off and on on several occassions but lately haven't talked cause I don't like to speak to exes so much and she cheated on me the last time we were together. But this one it might be that I was with her so long that I've attached. But yesterday she say me and decide to talk to me and she asked why I never talk to her anymore. In a descritly tone of voice I told her that I had no reason to talk so why bother. She said she miss talking to me and she still likes me. But could I say well I chose to say nothing just put my head down. We talked about old times and specifically one time when we hid from her mom and auntie who didn't allow us to go out. Well we hid in this bush and we began to talk non-sense and I could see that we slowly were moving closer together. I should've moved in for the kiss but I stopped and said we better go. I don't know why I did that what was on my mind to not kiss her. I always use to regret like crazy my action. I told her that and she said that she wanted me to kiss her so bad. I felt I could kiss her again at that point but I didn't wanna ruin everything at that point. So I said my good byes went home and put on some danger mouse. I heard the phone ring and I answered it and it was her. I was so suprised cause she never called me. We talked for 2 hours and I let so much things out. We told each our feelings how we missed each other after everything had happened. She  told she regrets cheating on me anf I told her how I felt about her cheating on me. And she started to tell me sorry. But after those words we started talking about usaul stuff and I asked does your mom let you go on dates yet. She answered with well kinda and so I said," So if I said you wanna go watch a movie or hangout then you can answer with what you feel." "Yeah" she said. "OK then I just asked you" "Of course but when"she said. "How about like during the whole fiestas and that" "OK" I felt so relieved and happy with that answer and now I have a date for next week. One prob I gotta find something to do with her well I guess whatever comes up.

       My First Mixtape:  Track 4: Social Distortion - Prince Po feat. MF Doom (produced by DJ Danger Mouse)    People kill themselves holding in their gases. Like when you need to fart but you don't, you hold on to it in. You're having these toxic gases that are actually killing some of your cells. You're actually letting methane into your system. You're suppose to let it out. Thats the way your body is suppose to work. But society has stop us from doing this. So we're making our lives shorter by not letting go or holding on to our poison to be polite. So people should fart.

       Best MC ever: MF Doom   ......plus this muthafucka makes his own beats     "I can stop anytime I want to/  Famous last words that came back to haunt you" -MF Doom Formally known as Zev Love X from the early '90s crew K.M.D., MF Doom's 1999 debut full-length Operation Doomsday, on Bobbito's Fondle 'Em Records, was undoubtedly one of the year's finest albums. Strapped with a descriptive and charismatic, multidimensional rhyme style, Doom's lyrical skills put most emcees to shame. As fierce as his verses are, he is also an incredible producer, with an affinity for '80s loops and dirty drum sounds sorely lacking in an increasingly synth-based medium. Interspersed with freaky storybook record snippets, he weaves an intricate web of nonstop sonic magic incomparable to 99 percent of modern hip-hop. Guest spots feature DJ Cucumber Slice, Kurious, MF Grimm, the Monster Island posse, and more. Keep an eye out for his new records, plus the finally released K.M.D. Black Bastards LP from '94. If fresh samples, bangin' beats, and high-caliber lyricism are what you're into, few can do it with more flair and originality than MF Doom.

       My First Mixtape:  TRACK 3: Welcome Back - Mase    Part 1   I had three favorite MCs/ Now I need replacements/ One's gone, One retired, The other one might be a racist/ Just look at the game and see how the pace is/ Its time for new voices and change of faces/ It usually comes in threes/ I'm a third of the fraction/ So let me be the first to make affirmative action/ I ain't playing no more/ No I'm coaching instead/ You can't say shit to me my emotions are dead/ Have you sleeping wit the fishies/ Make the ocean your bed/ You wasn't beefing/ You made a comotion and fled/ Burns are gonna be close to your head/ So when its time to shine you get skipped/ Like the top loaf of the bread/ So if I ever decide to fall off I still a level higher than you/              - IV tha MC

       My First Mixtape:  TRACK 2: To a Black Boy - DJ Danger Mouse and Murs     Up and coming producer Danger Mouse and Cali wordsmith Murs have collaborated on a truly inspired song “To A Black Boy".   Danger Mouse explains the story behind the song: "This true story took place in rural Rome, Georgia, USA just last year 2003! Marcus Dixon, an 18-year old African American high school senior was accused of rape by a classmate (a white girl only a few months shy of 16, a sophomore). The Jury quickly came back with Not Guilty verdicts on all rape & use of force, they agreed the sex was consensual (only took them 15 minutes). However, the prosecutor added the charge of child molestation since the girl was under 16. He was found guilty by this charge by definition and sentenced to a mandatory 10 year sentence. No high school boy or girl has ever been charged with child molestation of a classmate less than three years his or her junior until Marcus. Marcus was a star on the football team, an Honor Student (3.96 GPA) and had a full scholarship to Vanderbilt University. Marcus has already served one year and is still currently in prison. Please go to www.act4justice.com for more info and how you can help."   You can also check out the premiere edition of the new DJ magazine called Scratch (XXL's DJ mag), where they talk to Dangermouse all about Marcus Dixon, and "To A Black Boy" You can listen to the track at this  urlLink link . I listen to this and thought it was great. I found out about it through the Danger Mouse website cause I'm really big fan of him. But I never really knew of Murs that much but that man is ill.

       My First Mixtape:  TRACK 1: The Champ is Here - Jadakiss    The Last two days I was in Albuquerque. So on the way I just took a notebook and thought of some ideas of beats or scripts. I came upiwith a plot but I also came up with an idea for a beat. I was bored outta my mind. I finally came up with a solution onthe next stop I'll purchase the new  XXL  or  Source . So when we stop I got both new mags. But what I saw was pretty fuckin ill. It was the  premiere issue  it was  SCRATCH MAGAZINE . A magazine made for music producers. I was like wow!!! So I got all three. And right away when I got to my truck I had my eyes quickly reading through. And I spotted what is spotlight of an angel it was a Pioneer DVJ-X1(CD/DVD Turntable). This has its own hard drive so you can save samples and add it in when mixing. It also has a CD/DVD-RW drive to burn your work. but the cost is $3,299 but look at it its pretty too.:  .  But the look wasn't everything it just had everything I need so I figure I'll save up. So all there is to do is wait......oh yeah pick up the new  Scratch  magazine.  .

      I wonder what the world would be like without the hatred a scum for of its own self. Like people for the foundations that "save" dogs from hurt. You have heard it before its  PETA . They save a little over 3000 dogs a year but they also save other animals too. But did you know that they also but put some of their somewhat unhealthy dogs to sleep for good. Amount for this year was 2750. So lets do the math:   3000 -2750 ---------  250 saved by PETA   Hmmmm..how the hell are they saving dogs if they put most of them asleep. So I have conclusion that these people of  PETA  are BULLLSHITTT!!!!!!!!!

       Movie of the Week     A wave of kidnappings has swept through Mexico, feeding a growing sense of panic among its wealthier citizens, especially parents. In one six-day period, there were twenty-four abductions, leading many to hire bodyguards for their children. Into this world enters John Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA operative/assassin, who has given up on life. Creasy's friend Rayburn brings him to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to nine-year-old Pita Ramos, daughter of industrialist Samuel Ramos and his wife Lisa. Creasy is not interested in being a bodyguard, especially to a youngster, but for lack of something better to do, he accepts the assignment. Creasy barely tolerates the precocious child and her pestering questions about him and his life. But slowly, she chips away at his seemingly impenetrable exterior, his defenses drop, and he opens up to her. Creasy's new-found purpose in life is shattered when Pita is kidnapped. Despite being mortally wounded during the kidnapping, he vows to kill anyone involved in or profiting from the kidnapping. And no one can stop him. Starring:   Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Walken,Giancarlo Giannini,Radha Mitchell, Marc Anthony,Rachel Ticotin, and Mickey Rourke   Directed By: Tony Scott   Acting Rating: 9.5/10 Sound/Music Rating: 9.5/10 Overall Movie Rating: 9.5/10

       Where are you Andy?      Some of I hope have heard Andy Kaufman. If not then you have missed out. This man had a very unique sense of humor. It was kinda like a prank but never a punch line. He was on SNL(Saturday Night live), Taxi, and numerous appearances on Late Night Talk Shows. He also had an alter-ego  Tony Clifton (in pic to the right) . He also try to make people seem that he wasn't Clifton by having his best friend Bob Zmuda perform as Clifton and Kaufman would arrive on stage suprising everyone. Well he performed acts all around the states. He do several sketches as a "Foriegn Man", Elvis, he would lip-sync too the mighty mouse theme song, read from a novel The Great Gasby, taunting women into wrestling matches, singing the entire "One Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall", and my personal favorite he would take a sleeping bag on stage and sleep though the entire act. He later "died" on May 16, 1984 at age 35. But he once told his friend that he would like to fake his death and appear 20 years later to shock the world. But did he return well the world is not sure. Yahoo!! even posted a news bulletin about him being  urlLink alive . Even his alter-ego has appeared up again with Bob Zmuda in sight.   (Bob Zmuda does not appear in this pic) So in my belief I think Andy is.....Dead I don't know really. I just know he did pull the ultimate prank on everyone even 20 years after his "death". His prank was having everyone argue over his "death".    In Memory to Andy Kaufman (1949- 1984 or ????)

       In Memory Of Ray Charles Robinson (1930-2004)     BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Ray Charles, a transcendent talent who erased musical boundaries between the sacred and the secular with hits such as "What'd I Say," "Georgia on My Mind" and "I Can't Stop Loving You," died Thursday. He was 73.Charles died of acute liver disease at his Beverly Hills home at 11:35 a.m., surrounded by family and friends, said spokesman Jerry Digney. Blind by age 7 and an orphan at 15, the gifted pianist and saxophonist spent his life shattering any notion of musical categories and defying easy definition. One of the first artists to record the "blasphemous idea of taking gospel songs and putting the devil's words to them," as legendary producer Jerry Wexler once said, Charles' music spanned soul, rock 'n' roll, R&B, country, jazz, big band and blues.

       Andy Kaughman By Sage Francis   Now I know it ain't right, but I decided I hadta' / Us poets paint life, but don't get recognized till afta' / So I faked my own death just to see what would happen / As I taje shallow breaths and wait for people's reaction / It was funny at first, but I had to hold my laughter...wait / Before long I was on display at an open casket wake / And I'm the main attraction who draws a crowd. A freak show of sorts / Good thing my skin is pale enough to pass as a decomposing corpse / Frozen in my thoughts, laying stiff...playing with  / People's emotions and awaiting a kiss from praying lips that I hate but miss.  She didn't show...although she sent a card with flowers / How considerate. That little bitch would make me sit in my car for hours / Heartless powers start to devour my patience...it gets me violent / I'm ready to fly shit and end everything like "I QUIT!" Then again I sit deathly quiet...biting my tongue / Just excited that some kids...who were invited to come did / I'm the center of attention...the talk of the town / It ain;t all that profound, but on this special day of mine I'm the one the universe revolves around / It's like a birthday...kind of. I also found that it's the worst way to find love. White doves battle black crows in one of the back rows / And everybody my ass knows back home is sporting black clothes / Looking glum as usual...it's all too familliar / I put the fun back into funeral. My morbid humor'll kill ya' / For all that it's worth...the people who I thought were jerks / Were putting on the water works and it sorta hurts / My momma stroked my hair with so much care but hardly spoke / Now my heart is broke, and yeah...I should've let her in on the joke / But I'm honestly choked up, and I'm stuck holding back my tears / As I absorb the atmosphere, "I wanna turn back I'm scared!" Then a hand touches my shoulder to calm my nerves / And something odd occurs because I heard my father's words / So I got disturbed...as he expressed what he's never said / What bothered me the most is that I remembered...he's dead / I manifested destiny. The best and worst of worlds has come true / As I'm buried alive, in the back of my mind echoes his words:  "I love you."

       Rumor!!! or Real!!   &nbsp; We get a whole lotta stuff to these rumors. Believe it or not, it's hard work verifying what a RUMOR is and what it isn't! Well here is one. We hear there is some kind of brewing rap war in Queens, as someone recently attempted to take the life of Bang 'Em Smurf. Word has it the guy was a friend of Smurf. Ahh read the thing yourself, it came to us via the good old fashioned fax machine

        Lyrics with Meanings        &nbsp;     "Why are you even alive, Why they kill Tupac n' Chris, Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist', Why them bullets have to hit that door, Why did Kobe have to hit that raw, Why he kiss that whore,/ Why would niggaz push pounds and powder,  Why did bush knock down the towers,  Why you around them cowards,  Why Aaliyah have to take that flight,  Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari,  Why he take that bike,  why they gotta open your package and read your mail,  Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail,/  Why niggaz can't get no jobs,  Why they come up wit the witness protection,  Why they let the terminator win the election,  Come on, pay attention,  Why sell in the stores what you can see in the streets,  Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least,/  Uh,yea, yo,  Why halle have to let a white man pop her to get a oscar,  Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it,  Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch,  And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jadakiss, "Why featuring Anthony Hamilton"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Picking Next Week's CD   I felt like making a little competition between my CD collection in an interesting way.  Here are the rankings of this week's competition:  &nbsp;    5.Slum Village - Detroit Deli   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Voice:  4/5      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beat/Production:  4.5/5      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lyrics:  3/5  &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Credibility:    2/5      Singles:   "Selfish" Featuring Kanye West and John Legend    Why?:   Consicous rap has begun to takeover with Slum Village on board. They help the movement with great beats and lay back songs.    Why Not?:   They lost a key lyricist(Jay Dee) which made songs missing a key element.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;    4. Slipknot - The Subliminal Verses Vol. 3    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Voice:   3/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Beat/Production:   4/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Lyrics:   2/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cre dibiltity:   3.5/5     Singles:  " Duality"     Why?:  Great drum solos. And also an anticipated album with no disappointment.    Why Not?:   Lyrics! All Rock lyrics sound the same.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  3.  Brother Ali - Shadows on the Sun     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Voice:   2/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Beat/Production:   3/5&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lyrics:   5/5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C redibility:   5/5     Singles:  (none)     Why?:   Great lyrics probaly one of the best lyricist.    Why Not?:   His Voice and beats hurt the record.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;   2.  Immortal Technique - Revolutionary Vol. 2 &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Voice:   4 /5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Beat/Production:    3/5      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lyrics   :&nbsp;5/5      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Credibility : 4/5&nbsp;&nbsp;      Singles: &nbsp;(none)&nbsp;     Why?: &nbsp; The Realest MC out there. Everything he speaks is the truth. His has rhyming skills to&nbsp;kill.    Why Not ?: &nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;beats are good but when they're not good they're terrible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     1 .  Lloyd Banks - The Hunger for More   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Voice:  5/5    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beats/Production:  4/5    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyrics:  4.5/5     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Credibility:  4.5/5     Why?:   His punchlines will knock you out!

       CD of The Week: The Roots - The Tipping Point     On their sixth album, the Roots backslide a bit on the creative promise they showed with 2002's Phrenology. Instead of expanding into more ambitious and experimental areas--the way Outkast has, for example--the Roots tend to fall back to basics with vigorous, but ultimately conventional, lyricism. There are definitely some truly great moments here: the album opens with near-magic on "Star," a mesmerizing song that is one of the finest of the group's career, and Black Thought is a one-man tour de force on "Boom!" where he mimics Big Daddy Kane and Kool G Rap down to their velour sweats. But The Tipping Point also has some of their blandest production ever, and, at 10 tracks (plus two hidden cuts), the compactness of the album makes the problem spots stand out more than usual. "I Don't Care" and "Duck Down!" in particular seem derivative and commercially tailored. The main thing missing here is an overall guiding concept, something the Roots have never lacked before. The CD cover is featured in four-different pictures. Each has a pic of a different member of the band. I prefer Black Thought (shown at top).  Overall this is a straight classic album.

       Movie of The Week     The Butterfly Effect Director's Cut   I saw the original in theaters when it came out and was very happy with it. But the directors cut featured on the DVD is 10x times better because of its alternate ending.   A young man struggles to access sublimated childhood memories. He finds a technique that allows him to travel back into the past, to occupy his childhood body and change history. However, he soon finds that every change he makes has unexpected consequences.

       My First Mixtape:  TRACK 9 - Obnoxious - Immortal Technique     Part 3 of 3    Sean “P. Diddy” Combs’ Statement     The truth of the matter is that even though Shyne is young, he is a very independent young man. He’s always been in control and wanted to make his own decisions, whether it was his musical career or his personal life. And when the unfortunate situation went down, it came a time for all three of us—Shyne, Wolf and I—to get together and decide what we were gonna do legally. Shyne was adamant about wanting to choose his own legal team—which he chose, and whom I don’t know. My only connection is that Ian Niles’ wife has worked for me.  There was a time, early in the trial, I had offered my defense team. Shyne decided to use his own. I felt Johnnie [Cochran] could help. Whatever he wanted, it was done.   The only time I had a conversation with Shyne’s mother was after the verdict. I consoled her and said I would help her through the appeal process—which I did. Matt Middleton (Shyne’s entertainment lawyer) sent the bill, and I paid it to Alan Dershowitz.  Before the trial, we were in the process of recording Shyne’s second album. We renegotiated his whole situation and made sure if something went wrong, there would be money left for his mother. I don’t know if that money was given to her. There was a time I attempted to get in touch with her, and the message was that she didn’t need my help. So I didn’t push the issue.   I had no decision in his style of defense. If, legally, your defense is that you were in possession of a gun, and you fired it, there will probably be some time served. We were all upset and disappointed by the amount of time that he was given. It’s an unfortunate situation that I wish never happened. I am hopeful that Shyne’s time gets cut.   He’s not currently signed to Bad Boy Records. A few months ago, I had a calm discussion with his lawyer about his desire to be in total control of his own future. We decided it was best. It was no “I don’t want to fuck with you from jail” shit. Shyne and I have no problems. There’s no beef.

       My First Mixtape:    TRACK 8 - The Yo-yo - Little brother    Part 2 of 3   Pain from the Game     No one can imagine the agony a mother goes through with her only son incarcerated. In an exclusive talk, Shyne’s mother Frances Franklin speaks on the trial that changed her life.      Frances Franklin gave birth to her only child, Jamal Barrow, in Belize on November 8, 1978. (Her baby’s daddy, Dean Barrow, is the former deputy prime minister of the Central American nation.) Seven years later, she brought her baby boy to America—Flatbush, Brooklyn, to be exact.  Times were tough for a single parent in the hood. Frances worked as a housekeeper, hustling as many jobs as she could to keep a roof over her young son’s head. Her mother helped out, but often left to his own devices, Jamal found his way into trouble. He was shot in the shoulder when he was just 15.  Doing everything she could to prevent her son from becoming just another statistic, she moved the fam to another section of Brooklyn and encouraged him to hit the books and stay off the streets. Jamal got into writing poetry, and seemed to be headed for college. One day, Foxy Brown’s ex-manager Don Pooh heard the young buck rhyming in a barbershop. Soon after a meeting with Sean “Puffy” Combs, Jamal “Shyne” Barrow was signed to the hottest label in the game, Bad Boy Records.   December 27, 1999 is a date that Frances will never forget. Shyne, Puffy and the Bad Boy entourage were partying at Manhattan’s Club New York when what started as a minor dispute led to chaos and gunshots. Three bystanders were struck by bullets. Shyne, Puff and his bodyguard Anthony “Wolf” Jones were arrested and hit with weapons charges. Shyne, though, faced additional charges of attempted murder, reckless endangerment and various counts of assault.  The high-profile trial began January 17, 2001. Each defendant had separate counsel. Shyne’s lawyers, Ian Niles and Murray Richman, were paid by Bad Boy, but Puff retained the more famous names Benjamin Brafman and Johnnie Cochran.  Frances, who attended every day of the two-month trial, believes that the turning point occurred when the defense called a witness, Club New York bouncer Cherise Myers, who named Shyne as the shooter, and (in a detail that differed from an earlier account she’d given police) said that Puff had no gun. A week later, in Niles’ closing arguments, he acknowledged, for the first time in the trial, that Shyne did have a gun that night.  On March 16, 2001, while Puffy and Wolf were both acquitted of all wrongdoing, Shyne was found guilty of two counts of weapons possession, two counts of assault and reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and is currently incarcerated at the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York (formerly home to Tupac Shakur and Ol’ Dirty Bastard).  Three years later, Shyne has secured the heavyweight legal help of Alan Dershowitz in hopes of winning an appeal. Rumors of his impending release have reached a fever pitch and, as XXL went to press, label sources confirmed that Def Jam has entered into a multimillion dollar joint-venture deal with Shyne and his company, gangland Records. Frances, meanwhile, remains convinced that her son took the fall for his boss. Holding him responsible for Shyne’s current plight, she often refers to Puff as “the other guy” to emphasize her anger. Today, in an exclusive interview, Mama’s got somethin’ to say.    XXL: In the aftermath of the trial, you were quoted in a couple of newspaper articles. You seemed very upset with the things the mainstream media was writing about your son.    They were saying that he was a gun-toting brother. They were saying he was reckless, which he was not. He just made one mistake. I don’t see why during the trial they really bashed him. The reckless endangerment, the hurting of other people—they don’t have proof of that. There was another gun in the club too, a .40 caliber there. Linked to nobody. It wasn’t even a trial about him. It was all about the other guy. I always wondered why.    Do you think your son got a fair trial?    I don’t think it was a fair trial because of the lawyers. The lawyers didn’t do their job for him. My son’s lawyers were working more for the other guy. Ian Niles was a friend of Puffy. That’s the way Jamal got to know him.  If the other guy’s paying for your defense, most naturally the other guy can call the shots and say, “I want you to do this” and “I want you to do that.” It’s a conflict of interest right there. Ian and Murray Richman didn’t care about working for Shyne. Puffy was telling them what to do, what not to do.     Were you in the courtroom during the trial?    I went there for three people. I didn’t go there to just support my son. I went to support, God bless him, Wolf, Puffy and Jamal. I went there not knowing anybody, this was the first time I ever went into a courtroom. The first day we was sitting on the other side [the prosecution’s side], ’cause I didn’t know there was gonna be any place for me to be. When we had a break me and my mom went downstairs and, later, we were coming up in the elevator with Puff. He looks at me and said, “You look familiar.” And I said, “Yes, I’m Shyne’s mother.” He said, “Oh, you’re Shyne’s mother. I knew you looked familiar.” And then he said, “Well, I want you to come and sit on the other side [the defense’s side] with us.” So I said, “OK.” Days after that, when me and my mom came, there was no space for us, no seats for us. Already the people for Puff were there, seated—they weren’t thinking about Shyne’s mother or his grandmother. A lot of people came in support of Puff. So this tall guy, the guard, one day he had to say to them, “There has to be a row of seats for Shyne’s mom and his family.” And that’s the way we tried to squeeze ourselves in. And from there I looked at them and thought, they don’t care anything about us—it’s all about the other guy.    What was your opinion of the way the trial was going?    It was looking bad—not for Shyne but for Puff. Puffy’s driver went on the stand talking about the gun, and that was really looking bad for Puff. And I felt very bad too. And then Cherise Myers came on the stand and I could not believe it! Puff came up to me to apologize. And I was so shocked, I couldn’t say anything to him.    He apologized to you after Cherise Myers testified?    Yes, he said “I’m sorry.” Puff came to me and said, “I’m sorry.”    Her testimony was damaging to Shyne?    She totally changed her story. When we was going down in the elevator with the lawyers, I said to Murray, “How did you let this happen? You didn’t know Cherise was going to talk against my son?” He said, “You have to ask Puff that.” That’s what opened my eyes. If you are representing my child, how could you let something like this happen? But then again, it’s about who calls the shots.  I always thought there was gonna be a unity between them, that they were going to work something out. But he wasn’t looking out for nobody else but Puff. Do you think they always had that intention? Or did something happen in the trial that made them go into panic mode? I think he always had that intention, because we never knew what was going on until that day I walked into the courtroom and I heard this and I heard that. I don’t think he had a way of letting my son get off. Another thing I was totally upset with was that the jury didn’t even bring Puff in guilty of gun possession. Nothing!  Every day I get… Not every day now, because I’ve accepted it—but still not fully... But, God did it for a reason. Because if Jamal had gotten off, if he was free, maybe he would have to go back with the other guy. He betrayed my son totally. I don’t know who in the whole world doesn’t see that. But I read in the Village Voice that after the verdicts were delivered, Puff, his mother and Johnnie Cochran came over to you and said something to the effect of, “We’re going to appeal this, we’re gonna do whatever we can.” I wasn’t even there. I was not hearing anything. I was in total shock. I didn’t even shed a tear then. I couldn’t even cry. I cannot remember what Puffy said. I was out for a few seconds. I did not think that was going to happen. I didn’t like the defense. ’Cause all along they were saying Jamal didn’t have a gun, he wasn’t guilty. And then all of a sudden they have a plan. You understand? I didn’t like when I heard my son was gonna acknowledge guilt in any way. They threw the bag in his lap, let him be the fall guy. They think he had nothing to lose.

       My First Mixtape:  TRACK 7 - Start from Scratch - Shyne feat. Mase, Loon,& Mysonne   Part 1 of 3   Shot up at 15. Dismissed as a Biggie sound-alike. Billed as the gun-toting thug in “The Puffy Trial.” Jamal “Shyne” Barrow deserved better.    Carved into the facade of the New York State Supreme Courthouse in Lower Manhattan—literally written in stone—are the words, “The True Administration of Justice is the Firmest Pillar of Good Government.” True administration of justice? In the criminal case of Jamal “Shyne” Barrow—what the mainstream media calls “The Puffy Trial”—the truth is still a mystery. Even as Shyne was found guilty of assault, reckless endangerment and weapons possession, questions remain as to who shot guns, who shot first and whose bullets injured the three people who got hurt.   Here are the facts: On Dec. 27, 1999, there was a shooting at Club New York in Midtown Manhattan which injured three people. Testimony indicates that perhaps as many as three people shot guns. Yet only Shyne was charged with a shooting crime. Evidence found on the scene indicates that bullets were fired from a .40-caliber weapon. Shyne fired a 9-mm weapon. Who shot the .40-caliber gun? It isn’t clear. That means the truth may turn on the identity of a mystery gunman, a man described by two witnesses.  Should the mystery gunman have been charged with assault or attempted murder? Should Sean “Puffy” Combs have been? Can justice be done when only one of the people who shot is charged with shooting? And if that one person claims self-defense—as Shyne did—shouldn’t the alleged instigator of violence also be charged, or at least investigated? With so many questions unanswered, it’s a wonder that anyone was charged at all. Shyne spoke to XXL in the midst of the trial’s turmoil. It was a few days before closing arguments, and he had no idea how the jury would rule. He was firmly immersed in the details of the case, and fully determined to live by the code of the street—no testifying—even as he desired justice from the court. “I’m Gotti, nigga, for real,” he said. “I’m going out like a true warrior.” But Jamal Barrow is not John Gotti. He’s no master criminal, making himself wealthy by extortion and intimidation. He’s a 21-year-old musician who escaped the horrors of street life, only to be pulled back into violence by the overlap between the streets and the rap world. Shyne chose to carry a gun, and while it may have saved his life, it’s also sealed his fate. Awaiting that fate, Shyne was angry, fiercely intelligent, careful, emotional and articulate     XXL: You appeared on Politically Incorrect recently. Bill Maher really came down hard on you and you held your own. Do you feel that his attitude represents the mainstream view of hip-hop?    His attitude represents the White, Anglo-Saxon ignorance and disease that exists in the world—people that claim America was discovered even though people was already living here. There’s a continuity in his behavior. It doesn’t disturb me because I know that ignorance exists. And I thank God that I have the power to enlighten the people rather than just let them be bombarded with his ignorance.    One thing a rap star needs to do to succeed financially is to maintain credibility. Rappers rap about being tough and it sounds great on wax. Then you get out to a club and there’s people there who try to test you. How do you deal with that?     don’t understand why you are using the club situation, dawg. People try to test me anywhere. Here’s what I’m tryin’ to say, dawg: I’ma keep it real with you if you keep it real with me. Ask me the shit you want to ask me, and we get to the meat. I’m at a point in my life where I don’t play no games; it is what it is. So if you want to ask me what went down in the club, you do that. Other than that, a nigga get tested anywhere, man. A nigga get tested at the airport; a nigga get tested walking to the store.    Do you feel that when you were with Puffy, or now that you’re a well-known recording artist, people try to test you more often?    I don’t really put myself in the position, playboy. I keep it all the way real. I had two incidents being in this industry. One was when I got shot at in front of Daddy’s House [recording studio, in November 1999] and another one was in the club that night. Other than that I been cool. I keep it quiet, man. A lot of these rap niggas be living the life and they get caught up in the hype. I’m really not with that. I don’t have nothing to prove to nobody. I’m just a cool nigga, man. It seems that more than one gun was fired in Club New York that night. Why do you think you’re the only one who’s been indicted for attempted murder and assault? That’s just how they be livin’, playboy. Them kids don’t come to play. You get caught up in they backyard, they gonna jam you. The DA can charge you with anything. If he had an inkling he could have charged me with murder. Anybody can get indicted on anything, keep it all the way real. And the DA ain’t come in there with good will. Two shots fired from the burner I had—I did have a gun. But that don’t mean I tried to kill nobody. Niggas was bustin’ at me. Niggas tried to kill me. I was just tryin’ to defend myself and I still ain’t even aim at nobody. I just shot up in the sky, like, “Yo man, let me get up out ’chea.”     You fired twice?    Yeah. Yeahhh! I mean, niggas is sayin’ they heard seven shots. That means, yo, it was two more guns fired, and I didn’t even fire first. All these people claiming that as soon as they heard the shots they got hit, so that means somebody else hit ’em, man. And the ballistics experts is talkin’ ’bout, “Yo, it could be a .40-caliber that hit these people.” You know, the fragments in honey’s [Natania Reuben’s] face could add up to a .40-caliber. And they sayin’ that she didn’t get hit with a direct shot, ’cause if she did she’d’ve died.    Whose ballistic expert was that?    The DA’s ballistics expert and my ballistics expert    Witness David Cubilette said that a man standing next to Matthew “Scar” Allen—the man arguing with you and Puffy—fired his gun toward the ceiling. Did you see that?    Yeeeeah!

       Shyne Walking the Green Mile PT. 1    by Jigsaw     To have Shyne tell it, he learned quite a bit during his truncated stint as Sean ‘P.Diddy’ Combs protégée. Perhaps, the Bad Boy mantra, “We won’t stop” is an appropriate motif for Jamal “Shyne”Barrow’s life. The last four years of his young life, Shyne has made the Clinton Correctional Facility his home after being convicted for his role in a 1999 shooting. Since the altercation, he has maintained his innocence and his silence – until recently.  From the Dannemora, New York jail, Shyne secured a record label, through Def Jam and signed himself, a deal worth a reported $3 million. During his time away, Shyne’s allure and mystique has only grown as have his legions of fans. All of the aforementioned attributes have culminated as Godfather Buried Alive, his first set since his self-titled debut in 2000.  Scheduled for a release no later than 2009, Shyne is banking he will be out with a bit of trust in a higher power and the worldly help of Harvard law professor and lawyer Charles Ogletree (Tupac Shakur) and Alan Dershowitz (OJ Simpson). AllHipHop.com talked to Shyne to get the story straight from the gangstas’ mouth. (Part one of two.)     AllHipHop.com: What’s up, Shyne. How are you doing?    Shyne: I’m doing well under the circumstances.     AllHipHop.com: Now, how do you feel about this considering some of the material is old, before you went in?    Shyne: Well, that’s to be determined. There is new material.     AllHipHop.com: Some of it is old though, right?    Shyne: You know, I can’t really get into it, but everything on there is fresh. I can’s be too specific, but everything is fresh. As far as the fans, they are the reason I am even putting anything out. They are the reason I even came back in the business. That wasn’t my priority. My priority was to get back to the town (freedom) and get this appeal happening. But, the fascination, excitement and the demand for Shyne was just overwhelming. It was like, “Wow.” I had that Godfather sitting and I was just like “Why not put it out?” I got about 10 albums in my head so I’m like, “Why not just put this out?” I’ll put the other stuff out when I touch the town. If it wasn’t for the fans, I wouldn’t have put that out.  I’m not thirsty like that. I sat for four years, I didn’t talk to nobody and could have when for a longer time before I touched the town but I’m not pressed. What [this album] means to me is that God has made some people timeless. Some dudes don’t last four months in this game. It’s been seven years for me. From the B.I.G. s**t when I was criticized, to people judging me off of the strength of my talent for that to be coming full circle is great – especially here [in jail]. It ain’t like I’m on the town. To invoke this type of fascination from here, without talking, without doing nothing, just falling back, is miraculous. Godfather Buried Alive is my lifestyle, my struggle. I’m the voice of the suffering. This is a way for the suffering to be heard. The same way they are crying for me, they are crying for him [other prisoners]. He can live through me.     AllHipHop.com: Do you think the material and the things going on around the release of this album will affect you getting out of jail?    Shyne: This is American and in this land you have the opportunity to say whatever it is you want to say especially in art and entertainment. Me not being the guy that shot those people is going to get me out and the fact that my co-defendant (Sean ‘P.Diddy’ Combs) was paying my lawyer fees so my lawyer was doing whatever he said –that’s going to get me out. The fact that I was defending myself, because somebody else pulled out a gun and fired it at me – that’s why I am banking on.     AllHipHop.com: When do you expect to get out, because I have heard as early as 2005?    Shyne: Yeah, I have professor Charles Ogletree, Harvard Law professor, and Alan Dershowitz and I couldn’t ask for much more as far as lawyers. I’m on a journey. Worse case scenario, I got three more joints [years] to do.     AllHipHop.com: Have you learned any lessons since being in jail?    Shyne: I learned more than anything to listen to your gut and to answer to God. At the end of the day, I was the one doing the time. I’m the one that has to suffer and nobody is there trying to suffer with you. Everybody moves on and they keep going, which is fine. Now, that’s why I couldn’t sign as an artist on Def Jam, I had to sign to Gangland Records and then do a joint venture. No one can tell me what to do. I could never put myself in that position again. I had to put myself in a position where I had partners that wanted to invest financially and were willing to trust my creatively and support that regardless of how out-the-box it might be.     AllHipHop.com: Do you feel like you should have looked out for No. 1, meaning yourself, during the trial? People feel you rode for Diddy and actually, not talking, helped others that might have been guilty.     Shyne: Nah - black, white, from the street or corporate America – that’s unethical. I believe in loyalty honor, respect and that’s just the way I have been all my life. It’s just about putting yourself in the position where you can’t be the victim. I own half of my masters so I am getting my paper. I can’t blame L.A. [Reid], can’t blame anybody, because I made all the decisions. It was all my vision.  Unlike the trial, when I wasn’t paying for my lawyer, you understand? That’s the only thing I would have changed was having my own lawyer. But, as far as being more vocal, I wouldn’t have changed anything. The prosecution should have gone and found the people that shot those people. That’s not my job.     AllHipHop.com: Indeed, and that’s why I think people respect you so much, because you didn’t run your mouth. You mentioned L.A. Reid, but [former president] Kevin Liles has recently left Def Jam. He was a big reason why you came. Have things changed with your relationship with the company?    Shyne: Like I stated earlier, its Gangland. That’s my only concern. Yeah, Kevin was a big part of me going to Def Jam. He called me years back, when it was him and Lyor [Cohen]. I still talk to Kevin, but this is business. He made a decision that was about him and his family and I respect that. The only thing [that would have bothered me] would be if L.A. would have said we don’t want to manufacture and market Gangland Records anymore. He was trying to do something with Gangland when he was over there with Arista so its not like he was outta the loop. He had input and he’s been there. He is a venture himself. He started LaFace with Clive so he knows what it is to execute your vision and have that autonomy. That’s all I can ask. I’m not asking for anybody to hold my hand, I’m just asking to be responsible. I want to be able to put forth that effort. L.A., Kevin – whoever -just don’t interfere and we’ll be friends. I have all the respect in the world for L.A., he’s a f**kin’ legend.     AllHipHop.com: What your issue with 50 Cent and why you have been silent for so long?    Shyne: It’s my time. Timing is everything. He said something about a year ago and it just wasn’t time. [Editors note: In a freestyle rap, 50 Cent said, “I heard Irv [Gotti] trying to sign Shyne so I don't have no love for him/ tell him 50 said he's soft he won't shoot up the club again."] I was working on my appeal and I had priorities. I know who I be. I’m not here [in jail] as a pedophile or raping nobody. I’m here for letting my thing [gun] go off with some real killers, not rappers guys that really kill people. So, I didn’t testify, I faced 25 to life. [50’s diss] was a joke to me and he was calling apologizing. I don’t know if you heard the skit with Sha Money…     AllHipHop.com: Yeah I heard it.    Shyne: So, he was apologizing after he did the thing on the radio. That call came after, he was like, “I’m sorry, my bad.” He even asked me about [signing to G-Unit] so I let it ride. It wasn’t nothing I had to address, but cause he didn’t keep going on with it. I wasn’t talking at the time, I had the VIBE s**t set up, I had a lot of sh**t set up. I’m a business man. When it came time for me to talk, I had to set that straight. You don’t talk about OG’s like that. You don’t talk about dudes that’s buried alive, fighting for their freedom and its just going to go like that. That’s why [my diss record] is called “for the record.” It’s nothing that deep. You had your time to speak, I held it and now its my time.    AllHipHop.com: Will you continue against 50 Cent when you get out?   Shyne: Anything further than this, I’ll speak to him personally. He can respond, but after this, I’m not rapping about it. I’ll talk to him personally.     AllHipHop.com: Most times, 50 would have fired back something, but they did want you on G-Unit, correct?     Shyne: Yeah, you heard Sha Money [on the beginning of “For The Record”]. Everybody knows Sha Money.     AllHipHop.com: In not signing with G-Unit, one of rap’s powerhouses, did you know that you were destined to a bigger situation anyway? Some people would have bitten at the first think that came their way .    Shyne: You have to understand that labels have been getting at me since ’01 and I decided not to take anything, because I wanted to get my appeal shit together and make sure I was right. I wasn’t trying to get slutted out. I heard the Pac stories and just wasn’t trying to get slutted out. I just got done being slutted out and I’m doing 10 years for being somebody’s prostitute. Its like, f**k that. Never again. It came time to live it. I remember when Murder inc came to see me and they were the No. 1 set, on the way to the MTV Awards. Ashanti was on fire. Rule was killin’ em. I was honored that they wanted to f**k with me. But I understood the same way that they had their time, the same way it was Cam the year before, if I stick it, I might get my turn. I might not, but I might so let me wait. So that’s what that was, I could pick and choose. I could be a soldier all over again or I could take what I learned from one of the bosses [P.Diddy]. Despite what I feel about my co-defendant, he was a boss, he was a pioneer on this Hip-Hop entrepreneur s**t. I was there soaking it all up. I said to myself, “Its time to apply what I learned under his watch” and wait. I waited and I got my shot.     Part 2 of this interview is forthcoming.
