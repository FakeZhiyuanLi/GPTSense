      Hmm... I think I'm beginning to be aneroxic... Not sure... but I've reached a stage whereby I'm quite comfortable eating n vomitting... I think in no time I'd lose all the fats... Burn more fats and lose more weight... Hehe!!   Well, today is just another long long day... Sometimes I just dunno wat to do... Quite sick of it... At times I wish there was some powerful ideas that'd rise up n I'd get great ideas of how to do my sales.   Anyway today quite weird... Only managed to eat 1 meal n out of that 1 meal that i ate, I vomitted out... Oso had asthma attack... Thank GOd it was a mild one... Thank God I has my inhaler with me too... Else I think I'd be dead by now... Haha!!   Haizz... this Janice Teo ah nearly got me into trouble ah... She go n tell Ken from FF I like him... Pengz!!! How can she anyhow say de wor? Wait ah can't even be friends ah... Super scared of such things... To me Ken is like a big brother lah... Nothing more... Coz he's not a believer mah. Even if he was I think I dunno him well enuff to like him oso... Gosh... I hope such things dun repeat ah... Very scary... Thank God he din take it seriously...    Well, watched some magic shows just now on Channel 8 too... Quite funny... There was this part where the magician took two books then he flipped the page asking another person to say stop then after that the fella would flip the 2nd book to that page n the magician would be able to tell him the first few words from that page... Then hor there's another part whereby they pretend to burn the clothes n stuffs with cigarrette butt n scare the owners when end up nothing happened. Weird illusions... I wonder how they did it... Interesting...

      Well, today had meeting at work... Kinda sick of all the meetings... All they do is just to remind u of ur sales... Goodness... I sometimes just hate it so much that I wished there was such a thing called conference meeting so I can just shut off the volume n pretend to be listening when in actual fact I just listen to some nice music...  Anyway received a shocking news... Jason's dad passed away. I wonder how he'd take it. I hope he's fine. He's always such a jovial one in the office. Always encouraging me to close more cases. I hope one day can invite him to church. I think I'd think of ways to make a difference in his life.   Actually was thinking of going for his dad's wake but I dun hv money for the bai jing leh... Anyway I think I will SMS him n send him my condolosense(Dunno how to spell)   Above all I hope I can clear my Fast Start award by end of the week... Stressed ah!!!!

      Wonder why... See kkshi online like super hyper de. His life is like so carefree. Well, Gammadog disappeared halfway through the chat... Anyway tonite kicked quite a number of ppl out of #christian as well. Dun really wanna hv any enemies in IRC but seems like if I'm an op that'd be the case... Anyway, I hope that they will really stop creating so much chaos in the mains.   It's been some time since I last blogged then out of nowhere I oso dunno why I wanna blog again. I guess it's just a way of putting my tots into words bah. At least I dun have to report anything to anyone.  Well, today suppose to go over n play basketball with the cg but end up i wasn't feeling very well so didn't go. I wonder how did it go. There are so many things on my mind now... Sales, mum's biz, dad, cg, etc... There are so many things that I wish I can do but it seems like there's nothing much I can really do...    Perhaps the best solution is still to catch some rest n think about tomorrow as another new day.

      1st day of blogging after many many months of not doing so... I dun even remember wat's my previous blog's account n name... It's been so long... Inspired to blog again after some time...   Sigh... Dunno why... Saw Jan's blog today then kinda felt a little upset... Tot of my ex as well... Dun quite understand... It's been quite some time since I last had such thoughts... I may not really understand why but I guess things do happen for a reason bah.  Talking to Gammadog now. Was telling him about my stress... He dunno understand or not oso... I guess the best person to talk to in such a time is still someone who understands u n God...  Anyway I'm left with another few more days so gotta jia you... I must make it... Else it'd be so ridiculous to stay on... Sigh... God, pls empower me!

      Today is such a long n draggy day. I guess I'm supre pissed off with the fact that my pay was not fully paid. They actually held back my commissions. I'm so sick and fed up with the way they do things. Sigh... I guess the only thing that cheered me up to day was my work out at the gym. Apart from that, I found nothing interesting. Of course I hated the fact that I'm paid less than what an NS man can get by serving the nation.   Well, mum's shop is going to start soon. I'm planning to go teach part-time and probably earn extra income from there. Of course in my work at Manulife, I have to buck up too. Well, I don't know why but lately I have been avoiding Kenneth. I just don't feel like explaining anything. Also helping mum with the shop so kinda tired. I just need a break. I need a break from both mum's shop as well as my own work but I can't just go away like that at mum's shop. Sometimes I just wish there was an easier solution out.   Sigh... Kor is in Penang now. I wonder when will he ever have a gf that doesn't require him to go that extra mile. I do know that his love for that girl is real but sometimes I am afraid that the girl is not serious about him. Well, I don't know about this new girlfriend of his but I really hope that things work out for them this time round since he's going all the way down to Penang to meet her. I guess I can't blame him too since he really loves her n after mum's shop starts he may not get to visit her that often anymore.    Of course now he's not around I oso kinda feel a bit lonely. Usually there'd be someone around to argue with me, to fight me, to share jokes with me, to pick me up from customs, to play CS together, to go for supper together but now? Hmmm... No one around....  Some more must go home on my own cos he's not around...   Kaoz... Tonite took a cab... The taxi driver siao one... He very tiko leh... Pengz... How I wish kor was around to pick me up then I wun have to see him. He asked if I wanted to take his cab every night then he'd charge me RM6 special rate to go home. Pengz... I rather go to the other uncle whom I usually see at the customs man... He almost made me puke...   Oh ya... The porch light is down... I wonder when will papa repair it. It's so inconvenient. I just hate it man... It's like I can't see my poor doggies. Even to feed them oso so difficult... When there's no light, there's also more mosquitoes... ARrghhh... I just wish something can be done soon...   Well, I hope by the end of this week, my week will turn out better... I'm just so tiredz....

      Just got home not too long ago... Well, learnt a very valuable lesson today! Dun put aside whatever knowledge n gifts that God has given u. Still recall how I yearned to learn how to play the guitar when I was just 17 years old. At that time no guitar n no one taught. Yet, I just wanted to learn it somehow someway. I guess God is always there to grant us the desires of our hearts as long as it's of His will. Although I was being mocked at by others for the stiffness I still pressed on. Hallelujah!! I finally learnt how to play the basics n of course out of somewhere God provided a guitar too!   All these years, I have played my guitar on and off. Didn't really practice it fervently. When I went for the Chinese Church's CG today, I felt so paiseh. Paiseh coz I felt it was not well done n I was the cause of it. I didn't practice the guitar for so long. 3 months?? Gosh... It's so obvious till my fingers started swelling as well. Somehow along my way back I just felt rebuked by the Lord. The flow was however still ok I guess. Anyway from today on I'm never gonna put aside my gifts n knowledge, the valuable ones that God has given me. I'm not going to look back as well. Will look ahead, learn from my mistakes n move on. Nevertheless, I thank God for today's opportunity. It was truly a great learning experience. I will make sure my guitar stops collecting dust n is put to good use... Will bring to mum's shop n play there whenever there's time to spare.   Oh ya! Wei Hao is back!! Yippy!! Will be seeing him for service this Sunday. So glad he's back. When he's in Bangkok he always say he dun go to church. Sometimes can get quite worrying too coz it took so much to invite him back to church where he started to rededicate his life back to God... I dun wanna see him backslide again leh... I hope when he's back he'd be regular... Anyway meeting him up for breakfast on Sunday at church. I'm gonna step out n fight on. Time to reach out to more friends too!  I must do it!

      Wow!! Just realised that I've not been blogging for so many days already... Well, so many things happened over the past few days that I din blog... On Friday nite (4/6/2004) went to Jean's place to stay. At 3am, her dad sent us to Suntec to queue for her audition for Singapore Idol. She got interviewed by Gurmit Singh... Kenny's friend Sabastian too but haha not Kenny... Hehe!! He so funny... He asked is it because he dun hv a good face... Anyway there were other funny contestants who were interviewed too... I wonder when are they gonna show it on tv... Can't wait to see it. :) Must be quite funny... Gosh... Halfway through queing, it rained heavily. Thank God Kenny took the stuffs to the shelter n din queue with Sabastian coz if he did so all the things would have been wet n I would not have clothes to change coz I was drenched. Sigh... The ppl who had umbrellas din go back to find me... :(  Think coz in soaked clothes too long already so asthma oso came back. So scary...Thank God again that I had my inhaler with me.  Well, apart from all that happened of course on Sunday evening, met up with Angeline n the rest from Guitar4Christ at Marina Bay. We ate at Zhen Fa Huo Hai Sian. I think it could have been much better just that I was on diet n wasn't feeling very well so didn't eat much lor... Ate most of the soup stuffs... Aiyoh... Din realise that 7777777 was Joel my ex cg member till ah he called me Carol on the phone then when I saw him... Haha!! So funny... It was nice to see an ex cg member again. :) Haha!! End up Grace n myself learnt how to chop crabs but I must say I'm still quite scared of them... Haha!! Think must chop off their claws first before doing anything... better way...   Haha!! Went to the gym on Tuesday evening... Of course it was about time to weigh myself again... Guess what?? Hip hip hooray!!! From March till now I've successfully lost 5KG!! Hehe!! More to go!! Finally my mum sees that I've lost weight... Haha!! But of course I didn't tell her lah... Hehe!! :) Maybe I should put up a before n after... Haha!! Think not so obvious lah... Maybe just a bit...  Hmm... Guess that's about all that happened bah... Didn't do much after that... Not feeling very well also... Oh Yan Chiu called asking me to help her find guitarist for Chinese Church's CG but I didn't manage to find her any. So end up she asked if I could play for them. Pengz!! I very long didn't play already. Actually got phobia leh... Some more dunno so many chords. Had to bombard Wui Ping... Somehow feel that God's telling me to rely on Him not on myself. Will do so... I hope I'd be sensitive to the Holy Spirit...   Well, rashes have evaded my back. It's so irritating... Thought Mopiko helps but it din.. Even bought the Prickly Heat's soap to use oso no effect... Dunno how man... I hope it doesn't itch while I'm playing tonite... Else ah dunno wat to do... Still claiming His words... By His stripes I'm healed!   Think I should stop here... Else too long later people read till fall asleep... Continue tonite...

      Kinda feeling really tired... Seems like it's more n more tired each day... I wonder why... Even when I go to the gym, it's like such a stressful thing to go through... Well, all these won't last for long when mum needs me at her shop. Sigh... By then even CG n Service would be a problem. If only there was a way out. :(   Well, today suppose to go over back to office to submit some stuffs but then just don't feel like going out at all... It's such a hassle. I'm beginning to reconsider my thought about moving out. Perhaps it won't be that bad an idea after all... Hmmm... I wonder...   Well, it's still 12 more days to pay day... Gosh... I'm getting more n more broke each day... Still gotta clear bills... Gosh... If only there was an easier way out... Anyway I think I can carry on dreaming on coz the day would probably not come that fast... Boy o Boy I'm hungry... TIME TO EAT THE MEAL OF THE DAY!!!

       Sigh... So bz these few days... Applied for phone line with Dad on Saturday... Were pushed from one place to another... Shopped for furnitures but didn't find any suitable ones... Sigh... Internet can't be subscribed too coz they wanted us to go to another place to subscribe... So many things!! Arrgghhh!!!  Well, Sunday itself was a bad jam at the causeway. Called this friend to ask him if he wants to go down for service with me or not coz he was also late already. Was intending to take cab down so tot it'd be good if he can come along with me lor... Sigh... End up kena big aeroplane ride... If I know I don't wait for him... Well, no point crying over spilt milk...  Anyway, my CGL going to Israel this coming weekend ler... That means I wun be seeing him ler... Till the time he comes back. I hope he gets his LKY award along with the other one... I pray that he gets it n hv ppl hunting for him to work for them. It'd be a great testimony. He's such a brilliant young man. I admire him for his brains man... Sigh... He wun be around n that makes me a bit lost too... So used to having him around...   Well, din exactly have a very good day today... Not feeling well then some more must help mama do the paper work... Help her do ler then papa not happy with it... say not nice lah wanna edit this lah edit that lah... Really a headache man... Sigh...   Was talking to Lirhen just now... He was asking me this, "Would u be ready to give up everything n anything just to get a breakthrough in ur life?" Hmmm... That's such an easy yet difficult question to answer... Anyway I guess I would be. That'd also mean to have a lot of perserverence regardless of wat happens...   Well, tomorrow is yet another day.. Gotta go catch my beauty sleep now... Yawnzzzz
