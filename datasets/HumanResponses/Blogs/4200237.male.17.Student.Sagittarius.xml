      i had a good day today, oh man it was a georgous day out side and i didnt even mind having to work in a basement, me and my dad are putting the heating system in this dudes house (he's a teacher at NCHS) and i dropped a piece of sheet metal and it felt like i had cut my thumb off, but alas it was only a flesh wound, i wrapped a piece of shop towel around it and taped it on there with black tape and i think i will survive, but what i wanna know is who is going to write for me when school starts on tuesday.  i think i am addicted to mt. dew, i have a bad day unless i have some in the morning.  tomorrow is going to be a goof off day, we are going to a flea market early in the morning then when we get back we are heading to olney to a car show. so im not going to do much tomorrow cept spend money. we are having major problems lineing the tailgate up on the bronco, the tailgate itself is crooked, it had been dropped on its corner. so we are going to work on that somemore tomorrow as well, so this weekend marks the last free days i am going to have for about 9 months, it sucks, but it has to happen. later people

      Why do there have to be days that every little thing that could go wrong will? I mean the tiniest of things like knocking something off a table or cutting your finger.  The smallest most insignificant things just bother the hell out of you. and you just hate the world, you hate every thing about it, every person that comes near you you just wanna get away from them.  It just seems that i would rather die than put up with the shit.  Its not everyday that i feel like this but today was one of those days.  But I do have something to look forward too, school starts in 4 days.  I will actually get to see people again, people i cant stand and people i wish i was around more.  It has been an ok summer, but over all i think that i have been home way way way way too much. Not next summer, no way im movin out.  going off to college, i cant wait to get away from here. everything has become so bland. nothing new happens and my parents get on my nerves and when they get on mine i get on theirs so i think it would be better off for all of us if i went on my way. way way way way away.  Maybe i'll actually meet some interesting people there, where ever i go.  I am feeling a little bit better now. but not much.  It feels like every one is against me and i cant be myself without someone saying "Man that is stupid" I feel like that everytime i show my true self to anyone that i just get the door slammed in my face, and after a while my nose starts to hurt so i just keep the door locked up.  I am so ready for school to start, I think this is the first time in my history that i have been ready for school to start. I havent done anything but work this summer.  I went camping at Aaron's house i think twice and when i did that my dad was mad because i couldnt help him but damn it, when my brother was 17 he was out almost every single night and it was fine, but when i wanna go out one single night he flips out and stops talking to me for a couple of days, it pisses me off so bad.  thats why i cant wait to move away. i dont have to worry about pissing him off, cuz he know i wont be there.  I wanna do the things with him but he pisses me off, he gets mad at stupid stuff, and he has no patience what so ever and it makes me mad. i dont know i just can't wait till school starts so i can actually do something for once.  and to see some girls. man i have been girl deprived all summer practically and im about to go crazy.

      i wonder what it's like to be a chipmunk. gathering acorns and running around. its just one of those million dollar questions. kindof like what to eat, bowl of cereal or bowl of ice cream, man i need someone to make my decisions for me. like a woman, but i dont know, they take so long to make any decisions, i mean who cares if your shoes dont match your purse, oh excuse me "handbag", then the handbad doesnt match your top then they are just another hour late so im thinking man i would be better off with a man, NNAAAHHHH what the hell am i thinking, girls got such nice asses, oh man i see a chick with a tight butt and my attitude all clams up and i suddenly cant talk right, i always sound like a total idiot, well since ive got my sexuallity all out in the open, today was just another day, i woke up at 12 and ate lunch, talked to my dad for a while then watched tv for a while, got on the internet and chilled for about 2 hours, then looked through my senior pictures and picked 10 out of 50, it was hard, cuz as you can see i am so damn sexy, then my dad got home and we worked on our shop for a while then at pizza, i am so not ready for school to start, it starts the 24th, i do miss seeing and talking to people but i am not looking forward to 7 hours of people, people make me so made alot, just their stupidity, they think they know everything but really they know nothing, and throw everything away if it means gaining a few inches on the societal ladder. i have it figured out, highschool is all about being better than everyone else at whatever you do, whether its academics, sports, fashion, beating people up, having more money than other poeple, or even being a slut, its all a competition, and if you arent good at anything you are left in the dust with the scum of the school, i guess i am here because i dont try to be the best at anything except at being me, i guess people just dont like me because i wont play their games, and if i do they just put me down and leave me again making it hurt twice as bad, so i just stay back and watch, waiting for a chance to be the best at being me, i havent lost all of the battles i have fought, i have came out on top a few times, but not very often, i usually just dont fight them just to avoid the hassel, if i stay the same it is so much simpler but yet it is so boring, i am jealous of the people that go out partying every weekend yet i am not because i have somthing to show for me not smoking and drinking, i am clean cut and have money, i dont try to be like them and they put me down for it, i am jealous of the people that get invited to go out on the weekends but again i dont like the people that invited them anyway, its just the thought that counts, i dont talk to people much except for people that are in my circle, and those people i just chill with i never do anything crazy, except for the time i put my moms brand new explorer off in a ditch, it was a funny story, there also was the time craig drove out behind aaron's house and got stuck in his truck and in an attempt to pull him out aaron's dad bent his bumper and craig had to come to my house so me and my dad could fix it at 10 pm so craig would nt get in trouble, we get into some crazy situations but none on purpose, we are all clean cut, dont drink, dont smoke, and just arnt crazy motherfuckers like i know at school, i just wish people would see that and not the fact that we dont try to be better than anyone, but maybe since we are all seniors this year it might be different, maybe, well i am really looking forward to my senior year but i am not ready for it to be over all at the same time, well hell it hasnt even started yet so i dont have to be sad yet. girls for me this year is all going to be a different approch, i mean totally different, i am going to talk to her in person and hang with her and actually go on a date, yeah i know its pretty damn pathetic, but hey i've been burned in the past and havent had much luck with girls since, i guess im not cool enough, or not the best of the best so i dont know, i just want a girl that will love me and care for me, and not compare me with other guys all the time, i want to feel like i am the only one that she is concentraiting on, not me being just another guy that she might like, im tired of being a girl's friend i wanna be the boyfriend, i just dont take it that far, cuz it takes effort i guess, i wish it was easy, i find girls i like and can talk to but they always live like 2 hours away, and that just dont work worth a damn, well i will update more of my thoughts at a later hour, probably still tonight, but not right now

      I figured i would start off with a little about myself. I am a senior in high school that is very unique to my world.  I have several hobbies(mechanic, welder, demo cars, paintballing, computer geek, electronic freak, and anything i can do to get my hands dirty) i am also the co-editor to the yearbook at my school, speaking of that i need to work on my advertising example.  I also have a missile sitting in front of my garage, not many people can say that, i have many ideas that i am going to work on in this comeing year.  of which include, putting an engine on a shopping cart, and a remote controlled car powered by a weed eater engine.  I am an extreme paintball player, i play on a team, the name is Paintthinner, we just play in my friends backyard but its fun as hell, i have no commitments except whatever idea i am working on at the moment, then that is all i will do, everything else gets backseat.  I am rebuilding a 1986 Ford Bronco, it is going to be sweet when i finish it, i have rebuilt the engine and put a tricked out intake, exhaust, carb, cam on this baby, it also has a 3 inch lift and has 33 inch tires on aluminum wheels, only been working on it for about 2 years, i cant wait to hear it start up, i got the dash put back in last week and my brother is going to come and wire up the sound system he is putting in before i finish the rest of the interior.  then after this thing is done, i have a 1970 MG Midget that i am going to start on, it is a convertable 2 seater, we are looking for a small 6 cylinder to put in it because British parts are so expensive, I just ran a demo car a few weeks ago and for my first run i think 14th out of 26 cars in the feature isnt too bad seeing as how i only died because the inner finder pinched off my gas line. Well i reckon i will head out, i have some sleep to catch up on, its only 2:30 in the morning. i'll write again soon.
