      Yes, a very depressing title to yet another amazing song yet puts u in that mood where u start thinking bout things and well i guess thats good n a way...but ya =this is gonna probably not be the most uplifting blog out of em all cuz im writing to that song...theres this one line that says O HOW time has FLOWN...and well it has...i have such a short time on earth....i just realized that ive already lived 1/5 of my life,  20%(according to statistics)...thats alot of my life already GONE...and well its been fun but dude its not long at all down here...and man i really dont know what i would do if i wasnt a christian and didnt believe in God...there just wouldnt be any purpose...at all...Sometimes we get wrapped up in crud that really wont matter later on...and i say we cuz i do too...and it really doesnt so why do we do it...cuz we are human and we are blinded by THE TEMPORARY...sadly tons of people will be blinded until their death.........man i was listening to The radio today and this Expert guy or whatever was talking about all the Attack threats on a america n crud and i was like uh Oh...he said that he would be very suprised if there wasnt a nuclear bomb exploded on US soil within the next 3 years... and i was like wow my dads a conspirasist...he'll probably make us move to IDAHO!!!no just kidding but seriously that didnt make me too happy and ya they were sayin that NEW YORK CITY was probably the main target...and they were saying if it got hit...the worlds economy would PLUMMET and that we would likely go into a depression again and the STock market would just be GONE and ya not good stuff........so ya i would really be worried about all that stuff but i know ultimately God is in Control and he wouldnt let anything happen to me or anyone else who is his...so i hold onto that...and that keeps that FROWN UPSIDE DOWN or however that goes... so ya i guess basically the main message here is...BE HAPPY!.................o by the way we beat oakridge by 18 in BBALL...anyways where was i...o ya.................

      Today i officially declared war on my phone...i decided to switch phone covers....just for a change you know...nothing too drastic or anything...so i finally get around to switching the covers cuz it takes like 2 minutes to do it...so i start and well most phones you can just slide on the covers or snap em on...nooo you have to unscrew these 6 screws to get it off and to switch it...so im looking for the right screwdriver to switch these lil buddies up and ya none of em fit...so i get frustrated and my dad later on tells me u have to buy a special screwdriver for thosethings....So ya i was like OF COURSE...they couldnt of made it simple but anyways he goes out buys the screwdriver and i get to unscrewing...and i get em off and switch covers and i put the phone cover back on...and im like ok that wasnt too bad...so i call my friend cuz he called me earlier and then i realize he picked up but there was no sound and he couldnt hear me either...so im like hmmm this is gay...so i soon find out theres a microphone and a speaker that u have to take off the old one and reattach it!!!So by this point ive unscrewed the thing 5 times and im on edge a little bit...but not wavered by the mounting pressure...i kept my cool...so i continue to attach the speaker and MIKE and then i screw the thing back on only to find out that THE MIKE was put in backwards so it didnt work...so now im like aight this is the LAST STRAW...so i take it off turn the MIKE around and its all set...so i screw it all on AGAIN and im like this is it...its complete...AAAAANo the stupid phone wouldnt turn on...the battery was FULL!! yet when i pressed ON it wouldnt come on...just blackness...so man im killin rite now...so i storm off and scream and just go around dissin the phone and how homosexual it is...and then i finally decide to touch it again and dismantle the whole thing and start from scratch...i made sure everthing was perfect...no dust...no blood...no scratches...i was clear so i moved in and put it togetha and well it worked...so ya i dont know... me n my phone... we arent real tight right now...whenever i answer it...if i do...i hold it away from my head so i can touch it as little as possible...but i think we'll work it out somehow...if not, its all good... ill just buy a cingular or verizone phone...(this whole thing reminds me of 2 people somehow...)anyways the whole thing took about an hour n a half outta my day...so ya phones are gay...

      Ya i dont know if these is going to be a recurring trend...but ive had 2 different days already with 2 posts each on em...so i guess we'll find out if it stays this way...anyways call me a girl call me sappy call me w/e...but it hit me as i was driving home tonight...i was like...man i am alone...so i was like man i  wish i had a girlfriend...and then i started thinking of all the girls who i could see my self with...and really i was suprised cuz it was more than 3...hmmm....ya anyways and then i thought how this special girl would make me feel important and umm not alone...and then i was like well then she'll dump me or id dump her and then aloneness sets in again...not saying girlfriends are bad At All and they dont always end up bad either but ya moving on and then i lookd up and i saw the moon...or a sliver of it... and then i looked at the sky and how vast and HUGEE it looked in comparison to that sliver of the moon...and i was like man thats how i feel right now...unimportant, insignificant, and small...i mean in comparison to it all...everything that is going on in the world...what do i have to offer??? what do i matter...and i was all down and then i guess it was God b/c then he was like dude but u know me? i made all that stuff...and well you know me on first name basis...and i was like whoa dude  thats right... and then he was like dude i love you more than anyone on this planet could ever love you... well wait he didnt say dude but ya...and that hit me pretty hard cuz i kinda forget that ALOTT of the time...but ya that helped me cope with that lonely moment...i think every one in this world strives to be loved...people need to feel needed i guess...i mean i dont know if anyone could survive without love...love is what makes the world go round...so cliche...so true...so overused...still true...so ya thats my sappy...already been said...yet needed to say it BLOG for the year...might be more...who knows? who cares?...probably no one...I FEEL SO UNLOVED....ahhh WHERE IS THE LOVE...haha no jk...but seriously...

      Dont ever try to please someone if its gonna change who you are...its not worth it...you'll end up questioning yourself and most of the time the person won't even like you because they didnt like you for who you really were... so ya thats it(i bet everyone has said that once in their life...o well) BE WHO YOU ARE!! MAN im crying rite now...no not really but i would if i could..or if   i   wanted to??? i dont know it just seems to me that a lotta people rite now are doing that sort of thing...but o well... its high school...so i guess all that this blog really means is, is that im single and im lovin' it.........well not really lovin it but not hatin ya know...cuz there are definitely too many hatas' in this world...i think every one will agree with me on that one...but ya i just need someone to TURN UP THE HEAT!...or something...OR FREEZE ME...nothing in between...dont want that lukewarm stuff...ya...but i guess thats upo to GOD...and well....thats fine...

      Hey yall whats goin on....alrite moving on...ya...if i seem a little out of it on this Blog then just ignore it cuz man i stayed up all night at this lockin thing and im dead tired so ya...deal with it.....alrite well i was talkin to someone the other day about something that kinda made me feel bad and convicted inside....the issue was Making Fun Of people....or just even teasing....well if u know me i like to mess around and tease alot so when it comes to this matter I am definitely found GUILTY...and well not proud of that at all....but i believe ive gotten better at it within the past year...just cuz ive seen what it can do to someone...even if you are just...Joking around...so ya i guess ill talk some more about this but lemme show yall an email i got from someone the other day....     Hey, i just thought this would be a good thing to share w/ yall. Its my personal strugle with being the odd man out. Im sure there are many other stories out there that are probably ten times worse then mine but hopefully this one can make a diffrence in your life. In Junior High I was teased alot, and back then I didnt know how to take it very well so every little thing hurt. And I dont know why they chose me to pick on. I might not have been as "cool" as them in there eyes but did they have to point it out in front of everyone else? Anyways, the next year came and it was the same story just worse. They always seemed to some how know the one thing i was strugling with at the time and pick on me about that. Even though i was never put through physical abuse, the mental abuse was enought to make an impact on my life. So then the next two years were came and the teasing became less frequent to me, but more frequent on others. But even though they stoped picking on me as much, i still had the scars from those first two years. My self-estem level was killed in those two years and i've never been able to recover it. So im very self consious. Like one friend will blow me off one time because there busy and I'll automatically assume that they dont like me anymore or that they never liked me, they just pretended to. And this has destroyed a couple of my realationships with people. Also, its held me back in life because i just cant seem to get past what they told me i was in those two years. Its like something is always in my head tellin me im not good enough and theres always someone better. Which stinks because I know if i keep this up ill never amount to anything. Right now im considering going in to counciling to try to work this out so i dont have to deal with it the rest of my life. Now this isn't ment to be a guilt trip for those who have ever made fun of someone, but as just a reminder of the how u can hurt someone with an "inocent" little joke.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ---Anonymous     With that said i think that its safe to say that...Ya Joking may not get to You yourself to the point to where itll make you self conscious about yourself...but everyone has there presssure points...And i believe everyone out there has at least once in their life felt self conscious...or just flat out hurt by another persons remarks thrown at them...You may be like me and just joke around with a friend and say something that u didnt mean seriously at all... but sometimes people do take it the wrong way and ya...they may not show it up front....but back at home or wherever...it hurts....so ALL of this to say....YEa its cool to have fun and joke around but ya theres always a limit ya know...just always keep those in mind...and hey...maybe try Building someone up every once in a while...I know thats something i need to work on like a motha....or a fatha....or...nvm....but ya...thats it for today....  PS:just BE REAL tomorrow...thats what people want...to be real with them...no wonder REAlITY tv is at an all time HIGH right now...cuz people are starving for people to just be REAL...so...be yourself...haha...its more fun that way anyways...  &nbsp;

      Would you like to be known as someone who is easily read...and someone can automatically know what you are likely to do in a given situation???Or would you like to be someone who is  Mysterious  and can never be read at any given moment due to their wild, or   just longing to be different   type of personality....I dont know about you....but&nbsp; a part of me wants to be that person that has that mystique about em' and people are always wondering what he'll do next in life...and yet they will never find out due to his/her&nbsp;persona...i think everyone wants to be that type of person at some point in their life.........yes/no,maybe so?( most &nbsp;everyone i know is like the first person i described....easy to read...and thats why alotta people long to have that mystique...because its not them...and well its fun to not act yourself for a little bit....... thats why the girls are attracted to the bad boy....least every girl is to some degree deep deep down......but yes, the very sad thing about all this is......no matter how EASY to read a girl gets....i'll never be able to read one of em'....i mean She could be at the first Grade reading level and i wouldnt even have a clue...i guess thats how its supposed to be?.....All th girls who read this will probably IM me and say OMG U ARE SO WRONG...DADAdadad....GIRLS ARENT LIKE THAT............and that will just prove my point........o well......sometimes i wish i was Mel Gibson...he knows what women want...&nbsp;but i dont...and i guess thats alrite...it makes things a little more interesting....yet annoying at the same time..............but ya anyways its not like im caught up in this mess right now anyways....but i bet i will...anyways IM OUT...  &nbsp;  "What we do here&nbsp;on earth ECHOES through eternity!"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Maximus   &nbsp; ummm PS:....idk...just a little side note.......I think its pretty cool about how THE AD BANNER at the top of the page advertises stuff that i talk about in my blog....For instance, when i talkd about CHipotle....it had a little thing up there for chipotle....anyways i think that was pretty awesome....but im probably the last one to discover this phenomenon...

      Well im over half way done with high school and so i guess its time to reflect(no not really but we are going to anyways)...ya the whole time ive been in high school have been like a roller coaster for me...like highs n lows...well actually...the high's arent too HIGH and the LOWs are nt to loww...so i guess my life is like the Judge Roy Scream...cuz its not really the big daddy of all rollercoasters but anyways...ya....idk my high school "career" has just but been ok....i really havent changed a whole lot since 9th grade...in my eyes...i mean ive just been the same person...with a few exceptions...those late nights are killer......no j/k....but seriously.......im trying here......ok ya i havent really changed and well in the spiritual aspect of things i mean ive definitely had my highs and then there has been times where i just leave God outta my life for a while....i mean no joke...i would pretty much leave my house to go out one night and leave God at the house saying...Alrite God ill be back at 12!...see ya then big guy....and he is sitting there going....ok he just slapped me in the face again...i mean i just got back from camp and this is one thing i was hit hard with....I really in the past have just had times where i have "God TIME OUTS" and i just forget about all he is in my life and all he has done in it and all he wants to do....i just leave it be and go my seperate way...EVen in the short time ive had at camp i find my self doing things and going places...not thinking a thing about God....and im like OMG...didnt i a few days ago RAISE MY HANDS and praise the God of the Universe and SING....HOLY SPIRIT RUSH RIGHT THROUGH ME...FILTER EVERY PART OF ME... LOVING FATHER HOW I WAIT FOR YOU.... OH MY GOSH how ignorant am i???....dont answer that....I praise him like i love him and absolutely need him like the air i breathe one moment...but put me out in the real world and God is only a Krutch....a help...a provider...and yes he is those...but he is everything else...he SATISfies...but yes that has hit me hard and that is definitely something i want to change in my life....I want an INCREASE IN GOD in my life....i need more of him and less of me....JOhn 3:30...."We must Decrease, BUT HE  MUST  INCREASE." Man.... more of him less of me...and ya I can say this stuff....and write it out as passionately as i can but...the truth remains that FAITH WITHOUT ACTION IS DEAD...and until I break my pride...and become less....and become nothing...i will never be anything....UNTIL i become nothing...and well...its a work in progress...so ya thats it for tonight....pray for me and ill pray for yall...i sure as heck need it man....LATA...     ALL OF MY REASONING FELL TO THE GROUND WHEN I FIRST HEARD YOU SPEAK  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SOUND   -unbound-
