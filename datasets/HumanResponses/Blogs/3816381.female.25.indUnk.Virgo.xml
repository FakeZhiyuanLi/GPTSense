      To the people who decided to do a Village on Misti's house last night (glances meaningfully at two not-so-innocent-looking males...and perhaps one innocent-looking female), I must concede...that was pretty funny. Sick on many levels, demented, but funny nonetheless. I wish I had the creativity and the mind power to pull something like that off.   Meanwhile, while these folks whom shall remain nameless were carrying out their evil plan, I was at my parent's house, asleep after a long day of moving. Today, I went to the homeless ministry fot the first time in many months. Whilst we were walking down the street, a lady beckoned a group of us over. She told us that her daughter (who was there with her) had been in foster care for three years, and now she was getting supervised overnight visits. She wanted us to pray that she could get her daughter back. She knew we would, she said, because we were a church group. Cool things happen at this ministry. I had forgotten (in my six-month hiatus) how it was to help people out who are in need.   Afterwords, we ate, then I went over to the old house to meet with the landlord. Then I went swimming with a bunch of people. It was a lot of fun. Misti wanted me to go on the water slide, which scared the ever-loving fire out of me because I hate water slides that put nothing between the water and my rear end. Well, I did it, and I must admit...it was pretty cool. Even though I came up almost choking to death afterwords.  Well, I had to travel with my bicycle in my backseat, since I left it at the house by accident. When I got home, I had to yank that thing out. Big surprise--it got stuck. I was about to tear that bike apart just to get it out of my car. (Mental process: bike...or vehicle? Hmmmmmm....) Then the Captain Obvious solution came to my head: why not move the seat forward? So I did...and it popped right out. Hmmm. My brain power amazes even me. Except NOT.

      Greetings, everybody.  This is my new blog. I've decided to copy a good friend of mine (hi, Scott!) and start a blog, seeing as I'm moving to a new place. This will be my way of sharing what's going on in my life when I'm kind of (but not really) away from everyone.   So, about me. Let's see...I'm kind of cute (at least, I think so!) I like reading, writing, hanging out, watching Homestarrunner.com, and basically being...hmm...interesting. (That's a nice way to put it.)   So, today was my last day at my job. It was really sad. Weirdly enough, I had made more friends at this job than at any other job. It's weird because a lot&nbsp;of people there are just plain stressful at times. Not that I'm perfect by any stretch of the imagination. I mean, there are times when I would ask a question, and then five seconds later I would have to ask again because I would forget what the person told me. But anyway...just a few months ago, I would give anything just to leave and never return. Now, although I'm not sorry I'm leaving, I feel nostalgic in a way. I've met some pretty cool people there, and I will miss seeing them every day. Ah, well. Such is life, I suppose.   After work, I sat and talked to Sara for awhile. She's one of the aforementioned cool people. We just sat and chatted for awhile. Then I went home and did a bit of cleaning. I'm moving tomorrow, and I need to have all my stuff put into crates so I can move. Fun times. NOT.  I was just surfing some random blogs on the Internet, and I found some that were...weird to say the least. Some have entries like, "$O, tHe InTeRnEt i$ lIkE, $o KeWl!!!%* Jo$h AnD mE wEnT aNd PaR+IeD ALL NiTe!" and I'm thinking, "MY EYES!!!!" I don't see how people find that craposphere (hi, Brian C.!) kute. I mean cute.

      Maybe I should explain that last non-post to  you. It was the thirteenth post, you see. And I'm a bit superstitious about that. So I decided to make that one a non-post, and post my real stuff here on number 14.   So...tonight should be fun. I'ma go swing-dancing with a whole bunch of friends. That should be really fun. (Dang...I can't help being repetitive!) Luckily, I have some extra money from car-hopping.   Speaking of which, car-hopping's a blast. I really enjoy my job, except for ###### Hmmm....guess God doesn't want me to say negative stuff about my co-workers on my blog. Ah, well.

      Today Jeff Jones forward a bunch of us an article about this subcontractor that worked on the Boone Pickens Stadium at Oklahoma State University. Seems he got canned for arranging some bricks so they read "OU." Sounds like my kind of person. Snerk!   By the way, do you like my new word?

      Last night was a sleepy night for me. I came home from work, went straight to bed, and woke up about 9:30...went back to bed at 12:00, and just now woke up. Today's gonna be another long day at work. The one thing I would like to tell some of my new co-workers: Please and thank you go a LONG way in my book. 'Nuff said.  In other non-news....well, there's nothing else to share. Sometimes, I write in this thing, and...well, there's nothing to write about. No, really. During the work week, I don't see anyone from church, really. And on weekends, I'm not really at my computer. Sigh. So as you can see, I live a life in overdrive. NOT.   By the way, what in HADES is a blue oyster cult?! Sounds like a religion where you think you're gonna get to heaven riding a blue oyster, or something like that. Brian? Anyone?  I like flaming monkeys better. At least that sounds somewhat couth.

      (Original title: Wha-wh-wh-wha-wh-what?)  What a weekend it has been. I've been on an emotional roller coaster for the last few days. I'll skip the not-so-good stuff.  As far as good news goes, I have a job now. I work at Sonic. So far I've been making drinks and stuff like that. Hopefully they'll have me carhopping some, too. That would be awesome.   I started that yesterday. Saturday night I spent the night at Melissa G's apartment. She had a bunch of people over for game night. We played Mad Libs and Mafia. Mafia is an awesome game. If you've never played that before, you need to. Brian Mays brought his 7-hundred-million-game thingie that actually only has about 30 games on it. I played this game involving a bird trying to feed its chicks. No, that wasn't a joke. Another game involved a penguin speed-running around Antarctica. Or some continent. It sure didn't look like Antarctica to me. More like Australia. I dunno. There were some pretty weird games on that, if you must know.   Sunday I went to church, watched several Friends episodes at Brian Booker's apartment (with several other people), went to church again, and then went to Mel G's for a short Bible study.  Monday I went to Jay's house for a cookout. A bunch of us girls were talking to Marat. He's a friend of Amy's from Turkey. He accepted Christ this weekend, which was really cool. Anyway, Ellen and Misti were telling him about all of us, and how we're all different. I couldn't agree more. I mean, I'm one of the weirdest people on the face of the Earth. And people still love me. Right guys? (Just kidding)   Today I got my weekly dose of (new material off of) Homestar Runner. Good gravy. That was hilarious. Now I'm gonna have that stupid "Stave It Off" song in my head all week. I actually started singing that at work, and everyone looked at me as if they wanted to give me a drug test. Ah, well. I think that's even funnier that the Thnikkaman (Yeah, shut up, kid!) and Eh! Steve combined. Until next week, that is. Anyway, I miss Homestar, though. He's the cutest thing in the world.

      Hmmm....what do I write about today?  Having finished Where the Heart Is, I'm looking for a new book to read. I thought my mom had Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, but alas, I was wrong. Sigh. So I've been poring over my mother's massive book collection (and I do mean MASSIVE), looking for something somewhat meaningful.   Tomorrow I'm gonna try to make it into town for Game Night. Today was--you guessed it--more job applications. Eight, to be exact. I applied at all five Sonics in this area. The manager at one of them wasn't too nice. He was like, "You have a BA in Psychology. And you're applying at Sonic." I was like, "Yes, I am. So when do I start?" (Okay, so I didn't say the last part. Sigh. The creative things I think of after the fact.) This manager seemed bored with me, anyway. I got the vibe that he saw me as a white, upper-middle class girl looking for a diversion whilst eating peeled grapes from a silver platter and getting foot massages by guys in white tuxes that call themselves Beau. Growl. Anyway, I'm thinking a big NO on that particular location.  I also applied at Arby's and Pizza Hut. I could use some pizza right now. Too bad they're closed. Sigh.   Speaking of food, I've been eating incessantly ever since I got here. It's pretty sad...I'm eating out of pure boredom. Ah, well. Soon I'll have a job...then I'll have some kind of diversion.    On Brian's suggestion, I came up with some creative resume ideas.   1.) Make it so it bursts into flame after the recruiter reads it. 2.) Print it on Saran Wrap. 3.) Dot your i's with little hearts.  4.) Cut out letters from magazines and paste them on a piece of cardboard. 5.) Deliver it in an envelope that has a red slash across the front.  6.) Deliver it in a Viagra box.  7.) Write it out in Cool-Whip on a huge plate of Jell-O. 8.) Make it into a comic strip.  9.) Sing it on a DVD.  10.) Better yet, learn the recruiter's name, and personalize the cover letter part of the DVD to include the recruiter's name.

      I actually have people who read this! I talked to Misti for awhile, and she told me that she reads this every day. I love ya, girlie!   Brian Mays also reads this regularly. If you haven't read his comments, you should. Hilarious!   So...not much happened today. I took my job-hunt to Seminole, where I applied at Wal-Mart, Stage, and the school there. One thing about this: it's been helping my prayer life. I've been praying constantly for about a week now.   I've been reading this book, "Where the Heart Is" by Billie Lets. It's about this girl who's abandoned by her boyfriend at a Wal-Mart, and lives there for nearly two months before having her baby. It tells about her moving in with a resident lady, working at the Wal-Mart, and raising her baby. It's an awesome book.  One of the themes in the book is how God provides. The neighbors in the protogonist's new town provide furniture, garden produce, bread, and friendship. Even in the midst of poverty, God showered her and her child with blessing. That's a good message for me to hear.

      Today was more of the same. Look for jobs, unpack, wait anxiously for my phone to ring asking for an interview. So far, nothing.  But I haven't given up hope. I read on some website somewhere about some methods people use to find jobs. It also lists the effectiveness of each one. Turns out that posting your resume online has only a one percent effectiveness rate. I KNEW it!   I even called one guy on it today. I asked him for a paper application, and he tells me, "We do all our referals online." I told him, "I prefer to fill out paper applications. I know that people are more likely to look at those." He says, "That's not our policy." So I left. See, what with filters and everything, it's all to easy for an online application to be ignored. But if you fill out a paper one, it is more likely to be looked at. At least, I think so.   The method that the website recommends is face-to-face interviewing of people working there about the company, followed by a personal chat with the person with the power to hire you. Hmmm...a bit labor-intensive. But in my boat, I'm willing to try anything that will help.   Watch out world, here I come!

      Today, I was walking through the mall when I decided to go into Hot Topic. In case you didn't know, that's a place that sells...alternative clothing. Now, I'm as unalternative as they come. I'm the girl who wears baby tees (well, used to, anyway) and sings Britney Spears at karaoke parties. (Hi, Matt N.!) But I do love the fact that they sell reproductions of toys from the 1980's. So I went inside to take a look. And there, plain as day, was an office set inspired by Office Space! Complete with a Milton name badge and a Red Stapler! Of course, I called Brian M. right away to tell him.   Speaking of Brian, he continues to claim innocence regarding VillageGate, PistolPeteGate, and S-Gate. Now, the latter two I don't think he was involved in, at least not directly. But I know for a fact that he was involved in VillageGate. I mean, he's the only one I know that can pull something like that off. He's blaming it on the Collegiate Mafia. Hmmm...wonder if these same folks were targeting him next? Nah...they probably figure that he's been inconvenienced enough.

      Sooo...I am so proud of myself today. Not ONLY did I manage to apply to many, MANY different places, I also managed to set my parents' computer up for sound. Ah....And today being Monday (actually, yesterday), I got my Homestar Runner fix for this week. Unfortunately, there was no Strongbad email. Yet. I can still hope. They have this new game on there, but it takes forever to pull up. Sigh. Why do I even bother, sometimes?   Today I got a disturbing piece of news. Seems that the gym where I used to work at closed down. With no notice. As in...all the fixtures and everything were gone. Wow. I'm...stunned, to say the least. Of course, I pretty much saw it coming. I mean, memberships have been low for months. Looks like I got out just in time. God sure works, that's all I gots to say.   Tonight I went to the city and visited Amy. She and I chatted for awhile about the above situation. It's just amazing. Her new place is REALLY nice. I'm thinking about maybe moving to that apartment complex. I'll have to see where God leads me, though.  Whilst I was in the city, I went to Chick-Fil-A to say hi to my peeps there (namely Sara and Shaun). It's weird, not working there anymore. Sigh. I kind of miss the place, if the truth must be known. On the other hand, unemployment does have its perks.   Not that I'm just leisurely lolling around, mind you. Today, as I said, I applied at about ten different places. Most of them were sit-down restaurants. Hopefully, I find a place that pays really well that I enjoy.

      Today was a fun and exciting day. Of course, it started with me waking up late and travelling 45 minutes to church. I better get used to this commute. Especially if I am going to find a job in the city.   Well, I decide to go get some grub at 7-11. Whilst I was there, there were a couple of guys messing with their car over on the corner. They looked me up and down while I got into my car. Owing to traffic by the gaspump, I was forced to pass them by on the way out. One of the guys said to me, "How's about I give you a call sometime?" At this point, I would have done anything to be able to hop in the shower. Ugh.   Unfortunately, it wasn't over yet. I had to pass him AGAIN, because I had to turn around and go the other way. As I passed him by, he hollered, "Sweet baby!" Growl. I was not happy.   Well, I get to church, only to see red shoe polish on Misti and Mel G.'s car windows. Hmm....continuation of the Village prank? (stares Brian M. down) Anyway, other than that church passed by uneventfully.  After church, I went to Melinda's. While I was there, I got a bad hankering to get my hair cut. I enlisted Mel G. to go with me. It's rather cute, if I must say so myself! (I love my humility.)   Later on tonight, we played monster volleyball. It involves a HUGE volleyball, a complete disregard for the rules of the regular game, and every play being a game point. Interesting. I actually managed to get the ball over the net a couple of times. Aren't you proud? I thought as much.
