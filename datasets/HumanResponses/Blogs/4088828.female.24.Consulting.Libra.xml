      So, Sven and I went to San Francisco last weekend. It was awesome.  Friday we rented a convertible and drove to Napa. We listened to Tony Bennet and Chet Baker, and I did my hair all Bridget Jones style. We did two tours - Beringer and Robert Mondavi. I was hoping to hit 4 or 5 places, but we ran out of time. The important thing was we both got a healthy buzz, learned a little bit about wine-making and each found a couple new wines we like. (My fav was Beringer's new Sparkling White Zinfandel).  After that, we returned the car (a total ordeal involving buying gas at a very frustrating gas station where the gas pump required gross physical exertion and caused me to spill gas all over myself, getting hit up for money buy a bum, and almost busting my ass on a wet floor). After 2 shuttle rides, we arrived at the AirBART train station to San Francisco. By this time, Sven had been up for about 20 hours and became increasingly pissy about my navigation skills. We almost had an argument but luckily several nice Sanfrancisconians offered their assistance.  Arriving at the hotel was possibly one of the happiest moments of my life. I didn't have a detailed map of the area and assumed we'd have to lug our suitcases around for 20 or 30 minutes before we checked in. But, instead, as soon as we walked out of the train station there it was - directly in front of us, 15 yards away. And the hotel itself was great - it was the Hyatt Regency at 5 Embarcadero which I booked for $75 on priceline. The inside was totally fabulous, there 4 coffee places, a 7-11, and a Walgreens directly across the street, AND it was only a block away from the Ferry Building.  So, Saturday morning I got up and decided to explore a little on my own. I picked up some pastries at one of the coffee places and ran into a guy a used to work with -- totally bizarre. After that, I wandered over to the ferry building where they had the farmer's market, which is the precise moment I fell in love with San Francisco. (fyi - it turns out there is a farmer's market in westlake on Saturday's 10 am - 1pm if anyone is interested:  urlLink http://www.westlakefarmersmarket.com/index.htm  )  Then we went to Fisherman's Wharf and went on this boat trip. Of couse we tried some of the fresh crab, and then walked over to Lombard Street and Ghiradelli's. Then it was Rock 'n Roll Sushi and a very unsuccessful search for dessert. Honestly - what's with those Italian places? "Are you here for dinner or dessert." They might as well be honest and say, "if you aren't going to spend $80, get your fat american ass out of here because I'm not going to feed you." So, no dessert, and the line to get to the Equinox was an hour long, so no coctails either. We gave up and went to bed.  Sunday, we met up with some family friends of Sven, and had brunch in Union Square. Nice people. I especially liked the mom. She was very nice and particularly accepting of the crude habits of young people. I really appreciate people like that - because there you are trying to fulfill the duties of a young nice person and realize you've made 5 social blunders, and wish you hadn't tried in the first place. But, she made it seem like everything was okay. After that, we went to a couple of art galleries and then it was time to go home.  My overall opinon of San Francisco is that it is the very best place to be in the entire world - it is just the right mix of Europe and the United States. They have all the culture and quaintness of Europe but the service and bathroom availability of the good ol' US. My only suggestion is to provide a few bus maps for the tourists. Oh yeah, and lower the housing prices so I can move there.

      So, here I am.  Noon on Friday, working from home.  Completely hungover.  (Thanks to Nancy.) I'm supposed to be doing pre-training for my real training next week in St. Charles, but I haven't quite started.  I sat down to enter my ARTES (this dumb time report I have to turn in every two weeks - its a total pain in the ass)  and I'm trying to lessen the blow by doing other creative and positive things first.  Like start a blog - also inspired by Nancy.  Anyway, my next post I promise to talk about something, but for now, I just need to get the ball rolling...

      Training finally came to a close on Friday and after the violence described in my previous posts, I am happy to announce that there were several happy endings:  1.) The rude Parisian - I stewed on how to put this guy in his place with a witty and vicious comeback for almost a week, but instead ended up making a friendly remark. From that day forward, he could not have been more polite and nice to me. So, I don't know why he made that statement, but I don't think it was so mean-spirited after all. Probably just a bad attempt at being funny.  2.) The porn show -I have not entirely reached closure on this issue, but did contact the right HR people and they are looking into how to handle the situation. In the meantime, Rachel and I organized our own pub crawl for the second thursday night instead of going to that lame-ass bar (CR) again. Only 8 people came, 5 of which left for CR at 1 AM, but at least I didn't have to sit home by myself in order to boycott CR.  Other than that, it has been a relaxing weekend at home. My friend Jules graduated on Saturday, and I got to see my parents as well as my favorite wine-o friends Laura and Dean. Today Sven and I hung out at the house and did much needed life organization. Too bad I have to go back to crappy Pheonix tomorrow morning.

      Oh my God!  Chicago turned out to be so fun!!  Sven and I had already paid for a hotel room, a plane ticket, and tickets to see the Blue Man Group for this weekend when I found out we had training on Saturday.  If I was talking to you in person, I would spend 10 minutes bitching about what a bunch of BS that is, but I'll skip it for now.  Long story short, the faculty wouldn't budge about Saturday, and we almost decided for Sven to stay in Austin.  Luckily, we didn't.  Originally I planned to spend Friday night here at St. Charles and go to Chicago after training Sat.  However, it turned out a friend rented a car on friday and dropped Rachel and me off at O'Hare where we met her husband.  We went to the hotel and by a bit of luck got put into a suite on the 32nd floor of a 33-story building with a view overlooking downtown and the navy pier.  No kidding - my ears popped on the way up.  We weren't supposed to have access to the parlor, but the door was open!!  How to describe the sheer unbridled childlike joy I felt when walking into that room... imagine giving a banana tree to a monkey who has not been fed in weeks.   Anyway, so I almost went to pick Sven up at the airport but since he didn't know I was in town I was afraid I'd miss him.  So instead, I ordered champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries and was waiting for him when he got to the hotel.  (He didn't check his messages, so it was a total surprise for him that I was there.)  Rachel and Alex went to bed early, so Sven and I enjoyed our snack with a beautiful view of the city alone.  It was absolutely perfect.   Saturday Rachel and I got up early and went back to St. Charles for class and then had to go straight back for the Blue Man Group.  The show was great.  Usually during stuff like that, I'm thinking, "Am I having $50 worth of fun right now?" "Is it going to get better near the end?"  "This isn't what it looked like on TV."  "Shit, I need to make a haircut appointment soon."  But, I can honestly say my thoughts never strayed - the whole show was very entertaining.  After that, we went to a little pizza joint and then home to bed.  Today we rented bikes from the hotel and then rode over to the planetarium and the navy pier.  At the planetarium they had this theater which is like a sphere so we saw a show about Egyptians and their take on the stars.  Content wasn't too impressive but the special effects were nice.  The most fun part of the day was riding around on the bikes though.  I never realized Chicago was so pretty - there was a bike trail that went directly along the edge of the lake from our  hotel to the navy pier.  Lots of fountains and parks.  Very nice.  It was a great trip.  I'll post pics later...

      It gets worse.  Last night I went to Cadillac Ranch, a local bar, like every other analyst in Core Analyst School.  Its the only outing we do as a group and while it is completely voluntary, Accenture provides information about how to get there etc.  And i get there - its pretty cool - but then, there was this bachelorette party and the dj brings the bride-to-be on stage and instructs her on how to "dance like a dirty little whore" "spit and swallow" "pretend her husband is hung like a horse" etc and then has her do this slutty dance on stage, get on her hands and knees and pretend to suck a cock.  It was so embarassing and degrading.  It made me sick.  (mind you, this is not a fucking titty bar - this is a regular club with men and women).  So, i went to talk to the manager - he acts sympathetic but i can tell he doesn't give a shit.  He says, "well it was a bacholerette party and the other girls wanted to embarass her."  I told him, "well, you succeeded in embarassing her and every other woman in here;  I don't live here, but if i did i would NEVER come back here."   Also, here is an excerpt from an email I received from a female coworker:  "Have FUN tonight! I recall that their Amaretto Sours were particularly delicious. They have contests for FREE drinks throughout the night. Fair warning…the balloon contest will have you in positions with a guy that you wouldn’t imagine doing at a bar. Hahaha! On a side note – I was suckered into playing the game with a classmate. It was embarrassing, funny, and tiring, but I have to say we did place 1st…free drinks…whoohoo!"  So I guess this type of thing happens there all the time?  She doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with it, which really bothers me.  I don't know if its really okay with her, or she just doesn't want to come across as being prude.  I don't think I'm a prude for not thinking this okay - I mean really - isn't this just a question of common decency?  The other shitty part is - there are roughly 200 international students here.  And this is what they have seen of Americans.   Today I talked to a couple of female instructors - they were like yeah, we don't like it, but you can't blame Accenture.  WTF?  You encourage us all to go to a place where it is pretty evident that woman are brought on stage to act out embarassing sexual behaviors.  How am I supposed to feel any sort of dignity when put in this situation.  How am I supposed to feel like I have equal footing with my male peers today?  What message is this sending to young professionals, both men and women?  Fuck you Accenture.  You are absolutely responsible for cultivating this situation.   Anyway, so as soon as I calm down I'm going to email one of the HR reps here and request that Accenture pushes back against this type of behavior on the nights they send people over.  Other than that, I'm going to organize an alternative outing for next Thursday.  If you guys have any other thoughts, please let me know.

      So, get this.  Here I am at a team-building event intended to break down cultural stereotypes, and this guy from Paris asks me, "So, is it true that all Americans are stupid?"  Once again I was caught off gaurd and answered the question diplomatically instead of pointing out to him what an obnoxious prick he is.  Why can I never think of something sharp and cutting when people are mean to me?  I hate that about myself.  Anyway, the unfortunate part is that there are probably a lot of really nice people here from France, but this is the guy I will remember.

      dude, WTF??? Here I am at training - "the booze-fest of your life" according to several reliable sources, and so far things are a little on the rigid side - they have scheduled activities until 9 every night AND on Saturday. On the positive side, all the other analysts are really cool - it's 70% Europeans, 20% American, and 10% African/Middle-Eastern. So, there are all these really cool accents floating around.  Plus I think I'm really learning a lot. Today I learned that all consultant-speak words are interchangeable and can be used in any order to give an acceptable response. I spent most of the day making a list of these very important words and can now communicate as follows:  "While integrating the cross-group coordination for pig farming, it is essential to leverage the functionality matrix to enable technology resolution, solution-consistent containment synthesis, and repeatably deliver innovatively enhanced stage-containment resources. Furthermore, the time-to-market reusability will impact network-driven risk architecture to anchor mitigation assets in quality-assured tangible client quality managment assessment and integrate global focus-powered leadership towards framework extraction."  And you could absolutely reverse the order of all the words and it would still sound okay. Isn't it beautiful? Because do you know what that means? Yeah, nobody else does either. Its totally awesome. It makes me wonder. What am I doing in engineering? I should be some kind of senatorial speech writer.  Also, I should mention that there is a group of fraternity boys here in some sort of leadership convention. Today I passed one of their meeting rooms and the session title was "How to be a gentleman." Man. I just can't get over it - I've been looking for that room my whole life. But, here's the really sad part: I was just in the elevator with one of them and he freely scratched his nuts the whole way up. So, maybe the classes are too ambitious - they should probably start out with "How to be normal."
