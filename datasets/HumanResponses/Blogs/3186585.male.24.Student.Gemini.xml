      The inaugral journey of 'Snowboard Central' begins. I hope this Blog, committed to providing useful information about local and global boarding destinations proves not be a frivilous exercise for all who grace this page!

      Check out some of the ripping-it-up moves evident throughout the 2003 Australian Winter 'X' Games. These guys represent the cream of Aussie Snowboarding!! They'll be on display again this year for all to view at Perisher Valley. It's an awesome weekend that pulls thousands of spectators. Last year I went with 3 mates and entered ourselves in the 'tube race' and 'leap for cash'.  We didn't win either of the events, but it's the most fun I'd had in a long time.

      Anyone who has travelled will say it was one of the best experiences of their life. The friends you make, places you visit, and cultures you embrace are unforgettable. While I can't give away a free trip or make these memories happen for you, what I can do is provide the information any boarder needs to get connected with the wider Snowoarding community and perhaps tee up the possibility of making some new friends. Who knows where it can go from there....you may be able to organise some cheap (or even free) accommodation with a new buddy, find the best snow locations this time of year, maybe even spark up a romance on-line.   It's all possible when you log-on and become a member of  urlLink  Snowboard.com . I became a member the other day and it's without a doubt the best site I've seen dedicated to Snowboarding. Best of all it's free!! I set up a user profile, posted a mugshot and gave some of my background history.  Within an hour of setting up my membership I was getting messages and chatting with other boarders across the world online. It was excellent. Not only can you chat, but there are forums for tricks, photos, jobs, accommodation, study and heaps more.  I definately recommend this bad boy to anyone wanting to get out there and communicate with the global boarding fraternity. Catch ya!

      With the count down to the Aussie snow season well and truly in motion, I've taken it upon myself to cruise various travel web-sites in search of the cheapest ski and accommodation packages out there. Let me just say now, booking via the web is far and away the smartest move you can make. The savings are at worst, substantial. Check out some of the excellent deals on offer in the  urlLink STA  web-site for students and those of us on a tight budget.    Not surprisingly the competition between NSW and Victorian snow resorts this season is going to be fierce! It seems like the media marketing blitz has already begun and that it gets bigger every year. I've already seen and heard heaps of commercials on TV, radio, the web, and in the papers. It's definately gonna be an interesting inter-state race to see who captures the market in 2004. In NSW  urlLink Thredbo  and  urlLink  Perisher  have some of their usual alpine deals for early birds, as do  urlLink Falls Creek  and  urlLink  Mt Hotham  of Victoria. Careful with these ones tho, the snow conditions can be pretty sketchy this time of year! I'ts probably best to try and get in early and secure your accomodation for the high season. I've found that the longer you wait the less chance you have of securing what you want, when you want, at the price you want.

      Just a quick note....For those of us lacking a bit of motivation this year and need a nudge in the right direction, something that will get the juices flowing and heart racing is Warren Miller's new epic motion picture. His new flick  urlLink 'The Journey' , from all reports promises to be one of his best yet. I managed to grab a sneak preview of some of the film. The destinations, snow conditions, not to mention the inhuman tricks performed there are absolutely mind boggling. I had no idea people could do things like that on a board or pair of ski's?!! For anyone wanting to find inspiration, this is the film for you. Again I can attest to this as I have seen the last 3 Warren Miller films, and each gets better than the last. Needless to say I'm rubbing my hands in anticipation. See you all at the State Theatre later in June, then hopefully on the slopes!! Arivaderce

      Howdy!! After surfing the WWW and its multiplicity of sites dedicated to things snow related, I'm today especially keen to explore how Aussie resorts manage to keep customers returning for more.  When it comes to annual dumps of the white stuff, lets face it, Australia doesn't really compare with the plethora of Alpine regions around the world. So what makes the Snowy Mountains one of the most frequently visited tourist destinations in the winter time?  One reason would have to be be Australia's position on the global map - we are relatively remote and access to quality European, American, and Canadian resorts can leave you with an empty pocket after it's all finished, so the Aussie slopes are the next best thing. Another is the allure of seeing snow in an otherwised sun-burnt, drought stricken continent. Maybe its as simple as just getting out of the daily grind & intoxicating stench of the CBD for the weekend. Whatever the reason, here's my take on it.. I've discovered that in alot of cases it doesn't matter how the snow conditions really are, people will always visit the Snowy Mountains in Winter. I know this becuase I've been to the snow for the last 4 years and during that time, none of the seasons stood out above the other as brilliant - in fact, all were pretty mediocre. But I still loved hanging in huge chairlift lines, scratching my board on ice patches, and dealing with bumper-to-bumper traffic on the way home. Why??? Who knows.   Snow is an unusual thing, man made or not. Driving in your car and seeing that first snowy peak kilometres off in the distance is an awesome moment. The size, appearance, and inspiring nature of the mountains create the overwhelming appeal for many to come back again and again (getting goose bumps now). Sure skiing and boarding are fun, but ask the first timers how their ass felt after getting on the slopes for a day and they'll tell you, "never again!!" - that's what I said! Yeah it hurts and can be embarrassing at first, but getting the hang of it is all part of the fun. Once you've got the knack, it's like the old cliche goes, 'just like riding a bicycle'. Which is rubbish cause I think snowboarding is easier!!!   Snow and the activities around it represent something pure and unspoilt by the modern globalized world. Time spent on the snow is your own, it's free from invasion of personal space and privacy. I compare it alot to surfing. For those of us lucky enough to experience a trip to it, a snowy mountain adventure is something that stays with you forever. For those who haven't experienced it yet, plan your leave, save some flow and get there....you won't regret it.  CARPE POWDA!!! seize the powder!!.

      I guess the allure of icy wind-blown weather, inconsistent snow falls, and the thought of expensive cramped accommodation are too much to bare for many folks who have never tasted one of winter's finest achievements. For enthusiasts like myself however, winter represents the chance to experience something rare and special, the Australian snow fields. Wind blown pockets of powder, half-pipe and terrain parks, the feeling of cutting edges and carving turns on unspoiled runs, coupled with the unquestionable atmosphere the Snowy Mountain region possesses this time of year are what I have grown to live for.  For me it's hard to imagine any winter without packing for the weekend, dashing out of the office hours earlier than I should on a Friday arvo, diving into a friend's waiting car whilst shouting... "move move before I get caught", and meandering down the Sydney M5 motorway in anticipation of hitting the slopes. It has become an annual festivity for yours truly, and this year will again be no exception.  I can't wait to hear news of the first big dump mother nature throws on the NSW Snowy Mountains!!! Cause when it does I'll be ready to go!!!

      There's no doubt that stocking up on new threads for winter is tough. The cost of comfort can leave anyone with that sinking feeling in their stomach the next time the credit card statement comes in. But hey, nothing beats a new board, boots, or gortex laced get up does it!! That's why I'm looking at all the current gnarly gear on offer for season 2004.  I embarked on my retail journey in the heart of the Sydney CBD by visiting a couple of old stamping grounds. As you can see the gear on offer for both the fellas and the ladies this year is nothing short of awesome! Jackets, pants, boards, boots, goggles, gloves, bindings. You name it, it's there to be shnavelled up by the greedy wanna-be, looking to emulate Team Salomon while punching down the treacherous green runs of 'Happy valley' or 'Friday Flats'. Man the tow-ropes back up can be tough!! Just kidding to all the first timers, we all started there!! But for those of us who need the gear to combat the elements at the top of 'International', or even better 'The Saddle' at Whistler-Blackcomb, this apparrel is essential for battling the harsh elements delivered when reaching summits.  Check it out...
