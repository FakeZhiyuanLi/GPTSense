      Last weekend was quality. Apart from the fact&nbsp;I didnt realise, just how steep the hills were in Bristol. The club called Bar Latino was very cool as it had an outsidey bit. The music was good and so was the crowd. It was a 'Kingpin' Promotions night. My mate didn't win but he thoroughly enjoyed it.   Obligatory hangover the next day.  So far haven't smoked since Sunday evening this is going to be a bit of a test these Nicorette patches seem to be working tho ...,&nbsp;might go clubbing in London on friday, then down to near Portsmouth for a do in a field with some mates. The weather looks good so it should be enjoyable, hope the&nbsp;stereo doesent pop a fuse.

                     Well i'm off to bristol to go to a DJ competiton,  mate is djing nu skool breaks. Hope he wins, the tune selection should be good,  but there were a few galloping horses last time I heard him. Staying at a Dj's  house over there with mates. And on saturday, just going to my local town to the  pub, which should be cool to see some old friends from school.      &nbsp;    Another note      &nbsp;     www.drop-the-bomb.co.uk       &nbsp;    Should be a wicked party... Gabba , Doomcore ,  Oldskool and other such forms of kickdrum driven music.

          Anyway here we go  decided to start my first blog in an effort to make myself  better..         &nbsp;     Current  missions...         &nbsp;     - Stop  smoking         &nbsp;     I have been smoking  since 19, started at uni by smoking ganja. Always used to think that what's the  point in smoking cigs when they dont actually do anything.. I want to quit as  this thing has got a hold over me.         &nbsp;     Starting tomorrow,  seeing as tomorrow never comes... Tomorrow is Thursday 22nd July  2004.         &nbsp;     - Manage my money  better         &nbsp;     Bit carefree with my  spending. If I dont wait till i get it.         &nbsp;     Generally this whole thing is about me trying to get a  bit more self control. I will try and update it and hopefully you guys/gals can  see how I do, roughly where&nbsp;I go and what&nbsp;I do. Hey If&nbsp;I  fail&nbsp;I might be able to find out why.. I'm getting tired of letting myself  down.       &nbsp;     &nbsp;
