      I'm sitting here right now listening to two of my co-workers yell at each other from the other side of the building.  This is fun.  I'm a people-watcher (perhaps, since I can't see them, I should say "observer") by nature, and it's really amusing sometimes the things people can get riled up over.  Right now, the argument seems to be about exactly where on a form a certain bit of information needs to be written, about what the word "bin" means, and who said what when.  I feel like I'm listening to a Presidential impeachment hearing, at high volume.  I think this is an outstanding reason for doors on all of our offices.  We don't have that now.  Granted, our building isn't that big, and they're yelling pretty loudly, so I might still be able to hear them with a door or two in between.  At the very least, though, it would keep me from having to hear our Marketing Director's kid singing from across the hall when she's here.  Hell, for that alone I think I'd pay for the doors myself.  To be honest, maybe it's better this way.  For one, it's sort of amusing.  Actually, when they're finished, maybe I'll go offer some suggestions, just to see if I can rile them up again.  Secondly, it serves as a warning--by the nature of this conversation, I know it's probably going to involve me at some point.  At least now I won't be blindsided.

      Being that I don't like my job very much, Friday is always a day to look forward to.  This one didn't start off so well.  I am not a morning person by any stretch of the imagination, but a hot shower always helps me to wake up a little bit.  Unfortunately, the best I could get out of my shower this morning was "lukewarm."  Ah, the wonders of apartment living--I think the problem was caused by my neighbors also showering at the same time, but who knows?  At any rate, that didn't get me up and going as much as it usually does.  Maybe I should have tried a cold shower.  Hmm...no.  Anyway, after that, I had to drive to work, which involves fighting through traffic.  I just don't understand how some people are granted licenses to drive.  The drive-time traffic always irritates me, but today was at least a little worse than usual.  This is an exceptionally rare thing for me to say, but my day has been getting better since I got to work.  I'm finally starting to feel alert.  There has actually been some work for me to do.  I'll be getting paid sometime in the next twenty minutes.  Life is good.  The weekend is coming up, and it looks like it'll be a good one.  After work this evening I'm getting together with a friend I haven't hung out with for a while (his girlfriend had a baby last month, so he's been plenty busy).  On Saturday, the Falcons men's hoops team has a home game, and Anderson Arena is one of my favorite places in the world (a topic I'm sure I'll explore at some point).  After that I'm driving to Brandi's for the remainder of the weekend.  The Super Bowl is on Sunday.  In short, there are plenty of things to be excited for this weekend.  The real reason that Friday is such a great day, though, has nothing to do with any of this.  Friday is great mainly because it's a Wendy's day.  I work Monday through Friday, and I have a general schedule I keep about where I eat lunch each day.  The rest of the days are subject to a little bit of change, depending on several factors, but the one immutable thing is Wendy's on Friday.  I love Wendy's.  In fact, Wendy's is the reason I made a schedule--without it, I would just eat at Wendy's every day, and by now I'd probably weigh about 750 pounds and have two orange ponytails sprouting from the back of my head.  I do generally eat there one other time during the week, but as I've made a conscious decision to start eating at least a bit healthier, it's not quite the same.  On Friday I don't worry about it, though:  I go straight for the greasy burger and fries, woohoo!  My stomach is rumbling and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

      It's always cold in my office.  Actually, it's always cold on this whole side of the building.  Our Marketing Director comes to work around 9:30 (we start at 8:00) and goes to lunch around 11:30 (the rest of us go at noon).  Sometimes she comes back afterwards, sometimes she doesn't.  Coincidentally, she's engaged to the company president.  Hmm....  Also, when she is here, she often brings her kid to work with her.  The kid, who is a ten year-old girl, sits in the office across the hall and jabbers and/or sings (poorly) loudly and constantly.  I'm not even allowed to have a radio on my desk.  I hate it when people don't get back to me.  If I call someplace and leave a message, send an e-mail, or request a quote or whatever, it would be nice to get some type of response.  I also hate it when there are shipping delays and they don't inform me.  I just can't believe how some places do business.  The work flow is incredibly inconsistent.  On the whole, business has been down lately, so work has been scarce.  However, even now, sometimes there are days when everything is rushed and we need it done now, and there are other days when I just sit here dying of boredom.  On days like that (today, for instance), I try to come up with new ways of amusing myself, like writing pointless blog entires.  ;-)  It would be nice if the work was just spaced more evenly.

      This morning, my windshield wipers successfully made the list of "Most Useless Things in the Universe."  My girlfriend Brandi lives in Stow, OH (near Akron), and I occasionally drive over there to see her even during the week.  It's about two hours from where I live/work, which usually isn't that big of a deal.  This morning, though, there was a good deal of snow and rain between Akron and Toledo, which necessitated a good deal of windshield wiper usage.  It seemed like most of the time, using the wipers just made it worse--instead of clearing my view, they just smeared a whole bunch of crap over my field of vision.  Lovely.  I'm sure I ended up using most of my wiper fluid just to fix the damage it caused, which generally made things better for approximately four seconds.  Most likely they need to be replaced.  Another thing.  Maybe it's just me, but whenever I've had wipers start to wear out, they always start to leave streaks...RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE.  How does this keep happening?  It leaves a perfect streak of exceptionally unclean glass right in the portion of my windshield that I want to look out of, meaning that I either have to crane my neck to see over it or crouch way down to see under it.  This happens to me each time I start to need new wipers--it's uncanny, really.

      I was highly tempted just to jump right into this, but it would feel pretty strange to do so without a bit of backstory.  It would help to know where I'm coming from, yes?  Okay, maybe not, I don't know.  I'm new to this, and that's where I'm going to start.  I'll try to make this as short and as painless as possible.  I'm 26, but I have a tendency to think of myself as being younger than that.  That may be because I still live in the town where I went to college (Bowling Green, Ohio).  I'm currently doing a job I don't particularly care for--I'm the Purchasing Manager for a small manufacturing company just outside of Toledo.  That's just what I'm doing right now to pay the bills, though; it's certainly not how I define myself.  I'm a writer/editor by inclination, although finding steady work in those fields is not especially easy.  That's okay, though; I'll get there eventually.  If you read this blog regularly (assuming I continue to update it regularly, which remains to be seen:  I have good intentions, but we all know how that goes), you'll read about a variety of different subjects.  I'm a writer who hasn't been doing as much writing as he should lately, and I feel this is a good venue for me to change that.  There will probably be plenty of writing about the things I love--sports, literature, music, films, etc.  Plenty of other stuff crosses my mind, and you'll see that here too.  Some of it will be deep (hopefully), some of it will be banal.  That's just the way I am.  All I ask is that you come to it with an open mind, as you'll probably find that a lot of my views don't line up with the mainstream.  In return, I'll try my best to keep it amusing and/or thought-provoking.  Just don't hold me to it.

      So.  Maurice Clarett decided to challenge the NFL's early-entry rule in court, and won.  Now underclassmen will be able to declare for the NFL draft at any point they choose.  Previously, players had to wait three seasons after their high school class graduation, meaning they generally played three (or two, with a redshirt year) seasons of college football.  The general consensus on several message boards I visit is that this is a bad thing for both college football and for the NFL.  Several journalistic outlets have published this same opinion.  Watch out, everyone!  The sky is falling!  I was initially on the same bandwagon, but the more I think about it, the more I think it's not that big of a deal.  Let's take a look at a couple of points.  Let's get this out of the way to start:  this was the right ruling.  The NFL will appeal, and it will almost certainly lose.  In a free market society, I don't think you can justify a rule prohibiting kids from playing professional football solely because of their age.  Being a football player isn't like being a doctor.  You don't need a special degree or certification.  That being said, I do think the three-year rule is a good guideline.  There are very few players who are ready for the NFL before those years have passed.  I watch a lot of football at all levels, and the difference between high school and professional football is almost literally unbelieveable.  The time spent in college--adjusting to a higher level of play, and getting their bodies ready for the punishment--is time that most players simply cannot do without.  In part, I think this is why the rule change isn't going to be a very big deal.  Most players aren't ready for the NFL before they've been in college for three years, and they would have to be stupid or seriously misguided to not realize that.  I don't think there will be a mass exodus of players who think they're ready.  There will be a few.  Some will make it, and some won't.  If a large number of previously ineligible underclassmen do leave their teams and declare for the draft, then that will certainly hurt college football.  However, NFL scouts get paid to evaluate whether or not guys are ready to contribute right away.  There are only so many spots on each team's roster, and they can't waste them on players who need more time to develop.  There will definitely be players who think they're ready to make the jump, only to find themselves undrafted.  There will be very little watering down of the NFL's talent level.  I think that's where the real problem lies with this ruling.  Rest assured, there will be players who think they're ready for the NFL and give up their college eligibility to enter the draft, and end up out in the cold.  Players will definitely need to think long and hard about leaving college, and they'll have to think about it earlier than before.  They'll have to make sure they're getting and taking advice from people they can trust and people who will be honest about their chances, because there will be others trying to draw them out of school.  That's just the way it is.  And there are the rare kids who actually are ready before those three years have elapsed.  Those players should celebrate this ruling.  There's no need for these kids to continue playing against others who don't provide enough competition to make them better.  Imagine if this rule was in place for the NBA, and Lebron James was essentially forced to play in college this year instead of playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers.  He would be wasting his time.  There aren't many football players in the same boat, due to the extreme physical nature of the sport, but there are some.  I'm a little surprised that Maurice Clarett is the one who managed to bring this rule down.  In all honesty, I don't think he's one of the few that is ready for the NFL at an early age.  He hasn't yet proved that he can play a full season of even college or high school football without being injured.  I'm sure he'll end up getting drafted, but not nearly as high as he would if he would go back to Ohio State and have another successful season on the field.  That's assuming he declares for the draft, of course.  According to his attorney, the mere fact that he's won the lawsuit doesn't automatically mean he's leaving.  Yeah, right.

      Mostly sports items today.  * It's nice to see former BG Falcon Antonio Daniels doing well in the NBA:  urlLink Daniels offers Sonics some options   * I only saw Daniels play once as a collegian; Bowling Green played at Wright State when I went to school there before transferring to BGSU.  Although still a Wright State student, I was quietly cheering for BG, because I had already decided to transfer.  * Right now, there is one former Falcon in the NBA (Daniels, although Keith McLeod will hopefully be rejoining the league before long) and one former Wright State Raider (Vitaly Potapenko).  As it happens, both are now on the same team (the Seattle Supersonics).  This is good for me.  * Something that's just kind of funny:  at WSU, Potapenko's last name was pronounced pah-ta-PEEN-ko; now, in the NBA, it's poe-TAH-pen-ko.  * Listening to a local radio station on my drive to work this morning, there was an equipment malfunction during the traffic report, and the reporter's voice changed.  Suddenly it sounded like we were getting a traffic report from the Dark One himself.  * I don't care about boxing at all, but I did hear part of Lennox Lewis's retirement press conference on the radio this morning.  Let me tell you, I would  love  to have a British accent like his.  He just sounds so cool.  * Believe it or not, it's almost time for baseball to start gearing up again.  Spring training starts in a little over a week.  I'm already marking my calendar with the dates that tickets go on sale so I can see the Reds play in person a time or two this year--including, hopefully, my first visit to Jacobs Field in Cleveland.  * Reds shortstop Barry Larkin has announced that he will retire after this season.  Larkin has been my favorite player for a long time, and he's played his entire 19-year career with Cincinnati.  You just don't see that anymore.  We'll miss you, Barry.

      I'm very tired today, so I want to talk about books.  Huh?  Don't worry, I haven't totally lost my mind:  there really is a connection.  I stayed up much later than I should have last night because I was reading, and now I'm paying the price.  I do this often.  There are very few things I like better than crawling into bed with a snack (usually popcorn) and a book, to read a little bit before turning in for the night.  The problem with this is that I have no self control once I start reading.  I just lay there and keep turning pages long into the night, constantly telling myself "okay, at the end of this chapter, that's it, I've gotta get some sleep."  That doesn't work too well.  If you think about it, though, this really isn't a big deal at all.  Being a little tired the next day is a small price to pay.  As far as addictions go, this is one of the good ones.  Give me a fix of story anytime--anyone want to argue that it's bad for you?  I kick ass at Jeopardy, and it's almost totally because I read so much.  You'd be amazed at the "useless" trivia you can pick up by reading fiction.  Also, I'd be willing to lay down large sums of money (if I had any) that the reason I'm such a good writer (technically, at least--as far as the content is concerned, you can be the judge) is because I've always loved to read.  Being exposed to the written word so much had to rub off.  The book I was reading last night was  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .  Yeah, I'm 26 and reading kids' books.  Laugh if you want, but the  Potter  books are outstanding.  J.K. Rowling is a great storyteller.  Sure, these books may be intended for kids, but I think older readers will get even more out of them, because they'll notice things that younger readers will miss.  Anyway, the whole topic of the  Harry Potter  books serves as a nice bridge into a related topic:  book banning.  I was reading in the Toledo  Blade  this morning a story about a local school district in which a parent was challenging  The Bluest Eye  by Toni Morrison being taught in an advanced English class.  The parent's objection dealt with some descriptions of "explicit sex."  Keep in mind, this book is being taught to a group of "advanced" high school seniors.  For me, high school wasn't all that long ago (my ten-year reunion should be coming up next year), and I remember it fairly well.  I had some fairly clear ideas about "explicit sex," and reading some descriptions in a book would not have fazed me in the slightest.  I know that probably isn't true for every high school student, but it was for me, and I would imagine so for most of the people I knew at the time.  Also, this is a class for "advanced" students.  Naturally, the definition of "advanced" is going to vary from place to place, but I would like to think it would mean that the students participating in such a class are intelligent and mature enough to be able to read something like that and understand its context in the story.  In a book such as this, any sex is not going to be gratuitous sex for its own sake.  It serves a purpose.  I think it's a good thing for kids to read stuff like this.  Why?  Because the very fact that it's being challenged suggests to me that it's something that is outside of the world view typical to their part of the world.  I think it's always good to look at things from outside your own perspective, to get different angles and ideas about life in general.  Shutting yourself off from things you don't agree with invites stagnation.  I would imagine that the kids in a high school advanced English course are probably making plans to go to college, for the most part.  Once they get to college, they will be in a totally new environment, with people of many different backgrounds, and I hardly think that the worst thing for them will be to have read about "explicit sex."  Will that in itself make a difference in how they adapt to college?  Of course not.  It will, however, be part of their education in opening their minds, in experiencing things they wouldn't have if they were forced to stay the course and never see/hear/read anything that was considered mildly objectionable in their hometown.  How  Harry Potter  ties into all of this, of course, is that Rowling's series of kids' books is on the list of most frequently banned/challenged books.  As much good as these books are doing by getting kids interested in reading, there is a faction out there which would like nothing more than to see these books removed from libraries.  Trust me, I've tried all the spells in these books, and they don't work--no witchcraft involved.  Apparently I'm just not a wizard.  In keeping with all of this, I'd just like to encourage everyone to pick up a book and read.  I don't care what you read, just read something.  If you don't know what to pick, well, why not read a banned book?  Get a look at something that someone thought was too dangerous for you to see.   urlLink The Forbidden Library:  Banned and Challenged Books   urlLink ‘Explicit’ book faces scrutiny

      Another visit to Brandi last night meant another two-hour trip from Stow to Toledo on the Ohio Turnpike this morning.  For the most part, I really like to drive.  I always have, ever since I turned sixteen and got my license.  Even that embarrassing incident with the tree didn't diminish my enthusiasm for too long.  It's a simple pleasure.  Even before I was old enough to drive, I enjoyed taking long car trips.  They say that getting there is half the fun, and I've always found that to be true.  Well, maybe not half, but I can dig the spirit of the cliché.  I remember going on trips with my family when I was younger...it was always fun to sit in the back of the van with my headphones on and gaze out at the scenery, or read (I'm one of the lucky ones who doesn't get carsick if I read in the car), or sleep, or collect license plates from different states as we passed other cars.  Now things are a little bit different.  I haven't been on a real travel-intense vacation since I was 14, and I think the farthest I've traveled from home in that time was a weekend trip to Chicago with some friends a couple of years ago, or maybe a couple of trips to West Virginia.  Instead of piling in the back of the van with my cousins and a Game Boy, travel now means grabbing some CDs, getting in my Neon, and hopping on the turnpike or I-75 for an hour or two.  That isn't a bad thing.  Granted, I definitely miss the old days--a lot of fun was had on those trips, even before we got wherever we were going.  I still get the same basic pleasure, though.  This morning I got on the turnpike around 6:00 a.m., put on some tunes (John Mayer), set the cruise control at 73, and just let my mind wander.  It's harder now to check out the scenery, since I'm doing the driving myself, but that's okay--I just think about different things, and check out the scenery in my mind.  Yeah, that was a pretty lame line.  At any rate, I still manage to see some pretty cool stuff.  This morning I came around a curve and saw the moon setting on the northwest horizon.  It was almost full, enormous, and dark orange.  Pretty eerie.  Alas, it used to be that travel meant vacation and adventure.  Today it just meant one more day at work.

      Just some random items on my mind this morning:  * First and foremost, the title of this post is something that I read in a newspaper a long time ago.  I think it was probably the Dayton  Daily News .  I can't remember who the columnist was who always used it to introduce his notes section.  At any rate, I just want to make it known that I appropriated it for my own usage, because I think it's funny.  I'll change it up from time to time, if I do quick-hitters like this often, which I probably will.  * I heard yesterday a perfect comment to sum up my comments about Janet Jackson's breast being (gasp!) exposed on network television, courtesty of ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption," featuring Washington  Post  columnists Tony Kornheiser and Michael Wilbon.  Both agreed that it was no big deal, and Tony said sarcastically, "But Mike, what will we tell the kids?"  Mike responded (I'm paraphrasing here, but it's close), "Here's what I'd be happy to tell any kid:  'Kid, that was a breast.  If you're really cool, by the time you're 17, 18, 19 years old, maybe you'll see some more.'"  * Let's all give a nice warm welcome to February.  I stopped to put gas in my car this morning on my way to work, and it actually wasn't excruciating to be outside for once.  I checked when I got to work, and the temperature was reported as being 39°F.  It's amazing how downright balmy that seems after several weeks with highs in the teens and a lot of wind and snow.  * Speaking of gasoline, what's up with the recent trend of prices going up in the middle of the week?  I thought it was supposed to be higher toward the weekends, and drop through the week.  Lately it seems to be working the other way around, at least somewhat.  * I wore all black yesterday to mourn the passing of the football season.  To help soothe the pain of my loss, I purchased an authentic BGSU Falcons football helmet from eBay.  I've been wanting one for quite some time.  Eventually I hope to have a jersey to go with it.  Man, I love football.  BG's spring game is on April 10, and I'm already looking forward to it.  In the meantime, I'll be filling the void with Falcon hoops, which I love just as much (and maybe more).  * I was watching a college basketball game on television last night.  It was Miami at Ohio--those are both MAC teams, for anyone who may be inclined to confuse them with Miami (FL) and/or Ohio State--on Fox Sports Ohio.  With OU leading by 3 and only a few seconds left IN OVERTIME, they cut away from the game to show a pregame show for the Columbus Blue Jackets.  That's NHL hockey, by the way.  Would it have killed Fox Sports Ohio to show the last couple seconds of a great overtime rivalry game?  If that's an automated switch, I would think they could at least have someone review it before it happens.  OU did manage to hold on for the three-point victory, but it was certainly still in doubt when the coverage switched.

      Something unprecedented and shocking took place during the halftime show at last night's Super Bowl.  I found myself enjoying a Justin Timberlake song.  Let's get this straight from the outset.  Normally I'm not very much into bubblegum pop acts, particularly anyone recently escaped from a "boy band."  However, Mr. Timberlake's performance last night was fairly enjoyable.  The other performers were P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock, and Janet Jackson.  I generally like the rest of them, so enjoying Justin's song was an added bonus.  In addition to some pretty good music, the theatrics and staging were also incredible.  I found myself marveling at how elaborate it was, given how little time they had to set up and perform.  Don't get me wrong:  I watch the game because I like football.  This, though, is the first time I can remember that the halftime show was actually worth watching.  Didn't Shania Twain lip-synch her way through the show last year?  I can't quite remember.  Oh yeah, there also seemed to be some issue this year with one of Janet Jackson's breasts being exposed by the aforementioned Mr. Timberlake.  This was all over the news last night, the radio shows this morning, and most of my co-workers were talking about it when I arrived at work this morning.  Give me a break.  I can't believe this is even a story, or that I'm taking the time to respond to it.  Are there really people out there who are offended by this?  Seriously?  * Her breast was in view on-screen for probably less than one full second.  CBS cut away from it very quickly.  That was barely enough time for most people to even see it, let alone to be upset by it.  * The camera angle was such that it was almost impossible to see anything anyway.  For all I could tell (and I saw the replay at least ten times, shown on the local network news that night), she could have been wearing a flesh-colored bodysuit underneath her leather outfit.  I heard later that she was wearing something to cover her nipple.  * If her nipple was covered, then what's the big deal anyway?  Finally...being aware that this is a fight I'm never going to win, I feel compelled to mention it anyway.  Does anyone ever get offended about seeing a guy with his shirt off?  You see it all the time--on network television, in everyday life.  Why no uproar about this?  It's an inexplicable double standard, and I'd be interested to hear any RATIONAL explanations for it.  The only explanation I've heard for anyone being offended by Janet's (Miss Jackson, if you're nasty) boob flash is "my kids were watching!"  So?  Listen, the best thing you can do for your kids--indeed, for the future of America--is let them know that this is no big deal.  Trust me on this one.

       urlLink Movieoke:  like karaoke...but different!   I seriously hope this catches on and spreads through the U.S. like wildfire.  I can't even tell you how incredibly fun this sounds to me.  Brandi loves to sing karaoke, as do some of our other friends.  We go out for it occasionally, and I sit and watch everyone else sing.  I enjoy it, because I love listening to Brandi sing, and it's pretty entertaining to see other people do it as well.  Sometimes it's entertaining because the person can really sing, and sometimes it's entertaining because they really can't.  You just never know.  As for me?  I've tried karaoke one time.  I love to sing, but I've got one small problem:  I can't.  Trust me, my "talent" is best confined to my car, where I can belt it out as loud as I want without harming anyone's sensibilities (except Brandi's).  I'm not saying I'll never do it again, but I have very little desire to go up there and suck.  Maybe I should say I'll never do it again sober.  Even that may not necessarily be true.  But karaoke for movie dialogue?  Wow, that's a different story altogether.  I would be all over that.  I quote movie dialogue all the time now, sometimes to the point of distracting (a.k.a. "annoying") the people around me.  Anyone who read the post from a day or two ago will not be surprised to know that I can pretty much run with the original  Star Wars  movies, verbatim, from beginning to end.  I just have a memory for that sort of thing.  I don't put it on my resume or anything.

      You gotta love Anderson Arena.  Actually, I guess you don't have to, because apparently a lot of people don't.  The official attendance for last night was 2,146.  Between students (around 20,000), faculty and staff, and locals, I wouldn't think it would be too hard to fill a 4,700-seat arena, but it looks like I would be wrong about that.  On one hand, I can understand it.  The Falcons have a lot of talent but are struggling so far this season--the win last night puts them at 10-12, 6-6 in the MAC.  The plain truth is that people want to come support a winner, and right now we don't fit the bill.  We're too inconsistent.  Besides that, parking for the game can be a problem, particularly on a weeknight when there are classes going on.  The arena itself is a little old and outdated, and doesn't have any of the bells and whistles that newer places do.  Beyond that, I just don't know.  The arena is right in the middle of campus, which is a pretty short walk for any students who live in the dorms.  The team, while inconsistent, is talented and fun to watch.  Head coach Dan Dakich is one of the most animated guys around, and he puts on a show all by himself.  Then there's the arena itself.  No, it's not fancy, but it doesn't need to be.  For several years, Anderson Arena has been known as "The House That Roars."  When it does get full, it gets loud in there in a hurry.  It's packed pretty tight in there.  The student section (where I still sit, despite the fact that I graduated four long years ago) starts right on the floor, literally inches away from the sideline, with no barrier in between.  They're loud and obnoxious, and being right there in an opposing player's face can start to get in that player's head as well.  Ask Akron's Andy Hipsher, but ask him from a distance--he's liable to get violent, as he's done with our fans on at least two occasions (fortunately for Hipsher, this year--his senior year--his team didn't have to make the trip to Anderson).  I've heard it said that home court advantage in college basketball is generally worth five points.  In Anderson Arena, when it's loud and rocking, I truly believe it's worth fifteen.  I've never seen a team feed off the crowd's energy as much as some Falcon teams of the past few years.  It's unbelievable.  When it gets like that, the atmosphere is simply electric, and I rarely feel quite so alive as I do when I'm in that environment.  Needless to say, with less than half of the seats filled, it was nothing like that last night.  Still, I love being in Anderson, and I love watching the Falcons play.  I have to start off by saying that this game featured the most incredible dunk I have ever seen in person, and I've been to a lot of basketball games.  I'm happy to say that it was a Falcon who put it down.  It started with small forward Cory Eyink making a three-point attempt from the corner, right in front of where I was standing.  As the ball came down on the back of the rim, my eyes barely registered a flash coming through the lane, and as the ball bounced up, shooting guard Ronald Lewis took off, grabbed the rebound and tomahawked it down in one motion.  It was simply incredible.  I hope someone has video of it, or even a photo, because there are no words that can do it justice.  If I can find it online, I'll post it.  That was definitely the high point of the game.  Despite the fact that BG won 81-71, it was not a particularly good game.  Basketball games generally take around two hours, maybe a shade under; last night's was two hours and fifteen minutes.  I looked at my watch with ten minutes left in the game, and it was 8:30.  I remember thinking there was no way the final ten minutes would take half an hour.  I was right:  it took forty-five minutes.  The pace of the game was terrible.  OU decided to start fouling with about five minutes left, and it took forever for the game to end.  The officiating was pretty bad also.  Not biased or anything, just bad.  Unfortunately, this is pretty typical for MAC games, although I must say that last night's officials took it to a new level of suckiness.  There's one totally bald official who, every time I see him on the floor, I just cringe because I know he's bad.  Look, I know that every official, in every sport, will miss a call sometimes.  It's part of the game, and I accept that.  Hell, I embrace it--I'm not a huge fan of instant replay in the NFL, because the human element is part of the game.  Some of the calls this guy makes, though, are just outrageously horrible.  I saw a guy get elbowed in the face last night, and the foul was called on the guy who got elbowed.  I saw a foul called on a player who was at least a foot away from anyone.  I think he rubs off on the other officials too.  One thing that has always driven me crazy about BG basketball games is our pep band.  For a couple of years, the band was just bad, and painful to listen to.  It was a relief when the band went home for Christmas break and their place was taken by local high school bands, or by the Falcon alumni band.  I'm pleased to say that isn't the case anymore.  The band got a new director, and the musicianship has improved greatly.  Sadly, their song selection has not grown along with it.  The "Hey" song, from what I understand, has been banned by the Athletic Department due to the mildly vulgar little twist our students like to give to it.  During a game's stretch run, you can be assured that the only songs you will hear from the pep band will be "Forward Falcons" (our fight song), "Ay Ziggy Zoomba" (our unofficial fight song), or "Go Team Go."  It would be nice to have some variety.  "The Imperial March" (a.k.a. Darth Vader's theme) would be nice, as would "The Final Countdown."  I'm sure there are plenty of others they could play to offer some variety.  Hopefully that's on the agenda for next year.  But hey, despite the game's relative ugliness, it was a Falcon victory, and that makes it a great game in my eyes.  My next visit to Anderson Arena will be on February 21, when the Youngstown State Penguins come to town for the ESPN Bracket Buster game.  I'll be seeing the Falcons play this weekend, though, as I'm going to the game at Kent State on Saturday.  Happy Valentine's Day to me!

         You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.    Something strange happened this afternoon at work.  I actually got... busy .  It was weird.  I had real, actual work to do.  That hasn't happened for quite some time.  I had so much to do, in fact, that I couldn't do the writing that I planned while I was there.  You are now reading my first-ever blog post written from my home computer instead of the one at work.  As much as I hate going random two days in a row, here goes:  * I just got back from Anderson Arena, where my beloved BGSU Falcons pulled out a ten-point victory over the Ohio Bobcats.  More on that later, probably tomorrow.  * Not only was I busy with real work this afternoon, but I actually have some of it left over to do in the morning.  This is seriously a new development.  Sometimes I leave things on purpose so I have something to start with in the morning, but this is the first time in a while that it's happened on its own.  Apparently we've gotten a couple of orders in the past few days.  This is a good thing.  * I was talking to a guy at work today, and he told me he wishes he had never met his wife.  Woohoo!  Let's all give a cheer for the sanctity of marriage, shall we?  At any rate, all soapboxing aside, I thought that was a pretty dickhead thing to say.  Well, let me amend that...it's a pretty dickhead way to  feel .  I guess if it's true, it's true.  Hearing stuff like that just makes me wonder about people.  Sitting here thinking about it, I can't come up with  anyone  that I honestly wish I had never met, let alone anyone close to me.  * I also want to amend some of the nice things I said yesterday about Waldenbooks.  I went there after work yesterday and they didn't have any of the books I was looking for.  Looks like I'll be paying a visit to Amazon after all.  * I had an e-mail read by Tony Kornheiser on his ESPN Radio show this afternoon.  Basically I just said I liked his Old Guy Radio segment, and talked about the reasons why.  It was nice of him to read it, and it made me feel like a celebrity for the rest of the day.  * Today was supposed to be a day for eating healthy at Wendy's, but it just didn't happen.  Look, everyone, you just can't be clogging up the line in Wendy's when I go in there with the intention of ordering something that isn't totally bad for me.  If I have to stand in line, that gives me time to be subjected to the way the place smells.  I love  everything  at Wendy's, and if I have to smell it, there's no way I can order a salad, a potato, and chili.  I like those things too, but if I can smell meat and French fries, then dammit, I'm getting meat and French fries.  * Besides the fact that the snow on the ground is finally beginning to melt, I can tell that spring isn't too far off because the stupid beetles that have been infesting Ohio for the past several years are starting to come back to life.  I say we have a few days of nice, warm weather to get them all revved up again, then have one more hard, solid freeze to kill them all off.  I don't know whose bright idea it was to introduce these bugs to this area (and yes, it was done on purpose), but I hope that person is suffering.  * If you're going shopping at Wal-Mart, please do everyone else in the world a favor and LEAVE YOUR STUPID KIDS AT HOME!!!  It's bad enough with all the slow people clogging up the aisles, but I hate it when the place is also crawling with kids who a) keep screaming and won't shut up, which usually just prompts the parents to scream back, which makes it worse; or b) step in front of me while I'm looking at something and then just stand there.  People who know me will sign statements swearing that I'm the most laid-back person on the planet, but when faced with idiot children, I want to go berserk.  Someday I'm going to start throwing elbows.  * Needless to say, I found myself at Wal-Mart yesterday evening.  They didn't have the books I wanted either, but I didn't go in there expecting to find them.  I bought a Dustbuster.  More than a full day later, I haven't taken it out of the box yet.  People who know me won't be surprised.  Actually, they may be surprised that I bought one in the first place.  * Most of the lights in Wal-Mart's parking lot were burned out or turned off for some mysterious reason as I was on my way out of the store.  I was extremely surprised by how dark it was.  I had a hard time finding my car.  * A lot of times, streetlights turn off as I get near them, or they turn on if they were off before.  Does this happen to anyone else?

       urlLink The  Star Wars  Trilogy on DVD   The good news is that it's finally happening:  the  Star Wars  Classic Trilogy is coming to DVD.  There were rumors, of course, that this would never happen.  I never especially believed those rumors, considering that the prequels were made for DVD (although there was a period of time when  The Phantom Menace  was only available on VHS, and that made me nervous).  When Lucasfilm produced the  Indiana Jones  films for DVD, I figured it was a slam dunk for the  Star Wars  movies to be next.  Everyone just needed to be patient.  Now that I know for sure it's coming, though, I'm going to have a hard time waiting.  Call me a dork if it'll make you feel better, but these movies have had a huge influence on my life.  The first film was released in May of 1977; I was born two months later.  I grew up watching these films, playing with the action figures, wishing I had the Force.  Hell, I still wish I had the Force.  Even now,  Star Wars  is huge in my life.  I've seen both prequels on opening day and own both on DVD; I read the novels; I occasionally even indulge in video games or the roleplaying game.  Again, you can call me a dork if you wish, but I still find great enjoyment in the spirit and imagination of the films and the related media spinoffs.  It's a mythic struggle between good and evil, much like  Lord of the Rings , and I truly think there's something about it that everyone can enjoy.  Sure, George Lucas could use Peter Jackson's flair for portraying raw emotion in the story along with all the flashy effects...but then again, Jackson was bringing to life a pre-existing text, whereas Lucas is coming up with this all on his own.  At any rate, the original trilogy coming to DVD will be a watershed moment both for fans of Star Wars and for fans of the DVD format.  These are some of the most popular and celebrated movies of all time, and DVD will really make the visual and audio effects come alive.  I can't wait.  Now I just need to get that big-screen HDTV.

      I saw a man reading at Subway today.  I read on my lunch break.  It's just what I do.  I keep a book in my car, and I take it with me to whichever cholesterol dealer I decide to visit during the hour I'm given for lunch on any given day.  Today it was Subway.  Reading while I eat is hardly a new phenomenon.  I've been doing it for as long as I can remember.  Even when I was pretty young, I would often bring a book with me to the dinner table, or read the newspaper.  Not always, but fairly often.  Taking a book with me on my lunch break started a while ago as well, probably about three years ago.  I was working as an editor in the merchandising department of Spring Hill Nurseries.  I worked there with my friend Erin, and we used to eat lunch together every day.  After she quit, I needed something to do while I ate--I couldn't see myself just sitting there, staring off into space.  I love to read, obviously, so I started taking a book along.  An hour a day (less, when you take into consideration drive time each way, and standing-in-line time) doesn't sound like much, but when you do it five days a week, you can pound some pages.  I've lost count of how many books I've read over the past two years (since I started my current job), but it's quite a few.  I try to make sure my lunchtime books are books that I wouldn't necessarily read otherwise.   Star Wars  novels,  Harry Potter  novels, anything by Stephen King--I'm going to read those anyway, so I read them at home.  At lunch, I try to read classic (Nabokov's  Lolita , Joyce's  Ulysses ) or contemporary literature (Pam Houston's  Waltzing the Cat , Anthony Doerr's  The Shell Collector ), or stuff I want to read but probably wouldn't get around to otherwise (Clive Barker's  Books of Blood , the  Lord of the Rings  trilogy).  I indulge myself occasionally with something I'd read at home, particularly if I've got a couple in the queue, but I try not to.  It's helped me to broaden my horizons considerably.  Incidentally, I had Tony Doerr as one of my creative writing profs at BGSU.  He's a great teacher and a hell of a nice guy.  It turns out he's a hell of a writer as well.  Check out  The Shell Collector  if you're looking for something to read, and remember the name.  Anyway, getting back to the guy I saw reading today....  When I first started taking books with me to lunch, I felt just the tiniest bit self-conscious.  I was the only one doing it.  Sure, I'd see people sitting and eating by themselves, but they were generally just zoned out, shovelling food into their mouths.  I never understood that.  Trust me, I'm as introspective as the next guy, and probably more so, but I always thought that sitting there in a daze was a bit of a waste of time.  That's what driving is for.  As I said, I've been doing this for quite a while now, and it seems to me that it's catching on a little bit.  I definitely wouldn't go so far as to call it a craze or anything, but occasionally I do now see people reading while they eat lunch.  It makes me smile, and even though I probably didn't, I'd like to think I had something to do with it.  You know, someone saw me reading and said to themselves "hmm, that's a good idea."  In fact, I find that it makes good policy just to keep a book with you wherever you go.  You never know when you'll find a few spare moments to dip into it.

      Some thoughts while I wait for the Internet to catch up with me...  * I'm falling back into an old habit lately.  For a while, I had a very hard time making it to work by 8:00.  It wasn't exactly a New Year's resolution, but I stopped being late around the first of the year.  I've been continuing that trend up until this week, in which I've been fifteen minutes late both days so far.  It doesn't especially matter, because there's really nothing to do here right now anyway.  Besides, the only person who might actually care that I show up late (our payroll person) shows up even later than I do.  * I walked through the shop this morning, and it's like a frickin' ghost town out there.  There's almost no one left.  They've been consistently laying people off since I started here, and there still isn't enough work to keep everyone busy.  The guys out there are just wandering around, waiting for something to happen.  I hate to break it to them, but it could be a long wait.  All manufacturing jobs come through me (by way of Engineering), and I haven't seen anything yet this week.  I have no idea how this place is still in business, and I don't know how much longer it can be.  Personally, all I ask is a few more weeks.  If this place is still viable by the end of the year, I'll be astonished.  Unless some sales start coming through soon, that is.  * The reason I was walking through the shop this morning was, obviously, to get to the other side.  On the other side of the shop is where they keep the vending machine that dispenses candy.  I wanted to purchase for myself some Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which I'm currently eating.  Mmm.  * Speaking of work and the Internet...the reason it's so slow here is because there are eight of us sharing a single dial-up connection.  Welcome to the 90s; too bad it's now 2004.  * What happened to Amazon?  They used to offer unbeatable pricing on books, and I ordered from them all the time.  Now it seems like they offer everything at cover price.  Sure, if you order enough stuff, you can get free shipping, but then you have to wait over a week to receive it.  I've been doing all my book-buying lately at Waldenbooks.  At least there I get a 10% discount for being a Preferred Reader (a status you have to pay for, but in my case, it pays for itself rather quickly), and I get my books right away.  Still, if you're looking for something that's even a little bit hard to find, Amazon is the way to go--they have (or can get) everything.  * My mouth region is in bad shape lately.  I've got chapped lips which no amount of Chap Stick has been able to prevent, and there's a scab at one side for reasons unknown.  I also have a cold sore inside my bottom lip, and another unidentified sore underneath my tongue, which keeps scraping across my chapped lips.  Most unpleasant, and I'm hoping it all clears up shortly.  * On the bright side, I get to go to Anderson Arena tomorrow night, and that always makes things better, at least for a little while.  Well...provided the officiating is decent, anyway.

       urlLink Taft signs measure banning same-sex marriage   I'm so glad that Ohio's legislators and administrators are looking out for my best interests.  If it weren't for them, I wouldn't even know about some of the perils that face me every day.  I'll certainly sleep better tonight knowing that the sanctity of marriage has been successfully defended here in Ohio.  I'm also glad to know that this isn't a law of intolerance.  If Governor Taft hadn't said that, I can see how there may have been some confusion.  Thanks for clearing that up, Bob.  Call me crazy, but when a law is signed into action whose sole purpose clearly is to marginalize a certain segment of the population, yep, my first thought is that it may be a law of intolerance.  If Mr. Taft hadn't clearly stated otherwise, I may have had some not-so-nice thoughts about our state's esteemed elected officials.  Of course, he neglected to mention exactly how it isn't a law of intolerance.  All that really seems clear is that gay marriage won't be recognized in Ohio under any circumstances.  Nope, I sure can't see any discrimination or--whoops--intolerance inherent in that.  Sarcasm aside (for the moment), this is a giant step backwards, and it's overkill at that.  Ohio already had a law on the books that gay couples couldn't marry in Ohio.  Now their unions won't even be recognized if they managed to have it done in one of the few places that will actually do it.  I suppose if we're going to legislate bigotry, we might as well be thorough about it:  we'd hate to see anyone slip through the cracks.  I wonder how much laughter took place while this bill was under debate.  I know personally I can't even consider the term "sanctity of marriage" without a certain degree of amusement.  With high divorce rates, shows like "Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?", and the widespread availability of pornography and sexually related material both online and off, it's clear that the institution of marriage is no longer what it once was.  Just to be clear, I'm not demonizing any of these things; I'm just pointing out that they exist in our society, and all suggest in their own way that marriage is not nearly the sacred thing that so many people want to make it out to be.  I can only hope that someday this law will go away, as have so many other laws that mandated discrimination and marginalized people that only wanted to be treated with the equality that's supposedly a hallmark of our nation.  In the meantime, it appears we all have to suffer the leadership of people who are too small-minded to see that this truly is "a law of intolerance."

      Since there's nothing demanding my attention this afternoon, you get another installment of randomness.  What a treat.  * Colorado University head football coach Gary Barnett...is there any question this guy needs to go?  Seven incidents of alleged sexual assault by football players under his watch, including one against another player (female or not)--this gives, at the very least, the  appearance  of a program out of control.  Barnett can plead ignorance all he wants, but ultimately, the responsibility for the overall health of the football program lies with the head coach.  His callousness toward the situation doesn't help matters either.  It seems to me that CU's administration has no choice other than to fire him, if for no other reason than public relations.  * Baseball's spring training has started.  Individual game tickets for the Cincinnati Reds go on sale tomorrow.  Life is good.  * As baseball winds up, the college basketball season is winding down.  The BGSU Falcons have five more games (four at home) before the MAC Tournament begins on March 8.  The first round of the tournament is played at campus sites, so I'm hoping the Falcons play well enough in the meantime to turn that into another home game.  * One of BG's remaining home games is tomorrow afternoon vs. the Youngstown State Penguins.  I'm hoping to get Brandi to come with me, as she's never been to a game at Anderson Arena.  I'm also hoping a lot of people show up, so she can see how much fun a game there can be.  * The high school basketball regular season is also coming to a close.  My Troy Trojans are 18-1 heading into their final contest tonight at Huber Heights Wayne.  They've earned a #1 seed in the upcoming state tournament, which begins next Thursday.  Living over a hundred miles away, I haven't seen them play yet this year, but I'm hoping to make it to see them play at least once in the tournament.  * I caught a show on SpikeTV last night called  Most Extreme Elimination Challenge .  I couldn't describe it adequately if I tried, so I'll just say that it was incredibly funny.  They were actually showing a marathon, and I think Brandi and I ended up watching three episodes in a row.  * A wrestling match with my stapler this afternoon reminded me of another aspect of my former job at Spring Hill.  I seemed to be the  de facto  repairman for staplers and the copy machine.  Whenever someone was having issues with one of these items, they would come to me for help.  I'm not entirely sure why.  I did always seem to fix the problem...maybe that's why.  * It's raining pretty hard right now.  I can hear it pounding on the window in my office.  One of my coworkers has been complaining about the rain, loudly, for about an hour.  What's to complain about?  Anytime it's precipitating in February in a liquid rather than a solid form, I figure it's a good thing.  * Anyone else like pineapple on pizza?  I love it, but I seem to be in the minority.

      Once again, I was listening to "The Tony Kornheiser Show" on ESPN Radio while I drove to get some lunch this afternoon.  The best thing about Tony's show is that it's not always about sports.  I love sports, of course, but I can only take so much.  I want to hear stuff about the sports and teams I like, and that's about it.  When I get some local yahoo talking about the Detroit Red Wings, for instance, I switch over to my CD player.  Tony talks about plenty of stuff besides sports, though, and even when he does talk about sports I don't care about, he's generally entertaining/insightful/funny enough that I enjoy listening anyway.  Today he was talking about how much he loves his job as a columnist for the Washington  Post .  He said he still gets a special feeling each time he walks into the building, and he can't imagine what he'll be feeling when the time comes for him to walk out of it for the last time.  This goes without saying, but I would love to have a job like that.  I'd be highly surprised if it ever happens, just because I'm not the sort of person for whom a job will likely ever be the center of the universe, and it would take a lot to make me that passionate about it.  Still, considering that I'm probably going to be working for the next, oh, forty years or so, it would be wonderful to find a job that made me feel so alive every day.  The job I currently have...well, let's just say that it's pretty far from being my dream job.  I have pretty much no feeling when I come in here each morning.  Believe it or not, that's an improvement.  There was a time when I  hated  this place, and dreaded coming here with every ounce of my being.  My current position in purchasing is definitely not related to my background, so I was way out of my comfort zone for some time after taking it on.  As I've progressed, I've learned a lot, and I've even gotten to a point where I feel I'm pretty decent at what I do.  I get no particular pride from it, though.  This is just what I do to pay the bills.  I come in each day and do my thing, and when I leave here at 5:00 I forget this place exists until I have to come in the next day.  Rinse and repeat.  So far the best job I've had was when I worked as a proofreader in the Merchandising department of  urlLink Spring Hill Nurseries , which is a mail-order horticulture company.  I got to indulge my passion for editing (as well as utilizing my degree), as I proofread the catalogs and mailings.  I also got involved in other things I ended up enjoying, such as writing planting guides, and choosing photography.  There were only ten people in our department, and we had a building to ourselves.  I liked almost everyone I worked with, and a couple of them I liked really well--one of whom I'm still close friends with now.  We had a limited form of flextime, which came in handy.  Best of all, we were a newly formed department, which meant that we were building from the ground up, and we all had a chance to really be involved with how things evolved.  The pay sucked, and not every day was a good one, but I did like it quite a bit.  Unfortunately, Spring Hill's parent company went out of business in June of 2001, after I had been there for only four months (SHN was later bought by another company and has resumed operations, but our department's functions were outsourced).  That's the sort of job I'm looking for now.  I know that it's not going to be perfect.  I just want to be in a position that I can enjoy most of the time.  Preferably, I'm looking for an editing job, because that's something I love doing.  I've got inquiries out now on other types of jobs, but to be honest, I don't want them.  Not any more than I want the job I have now, at any rate.  Like as not, I'm going to end up taking another job like that, as I'm planning to move in May.  So what's my dream job?  What's the job that would get me excited to go to work every day?  I don't know for sure, but I have a couple of ideas.  I would love to be able to make a living as a writer of fiction.  I don't know if that exactly qualifies as a day job, though.  Besides that, the only thing I can think of that I would absolutely love would be working (in any capacity, really) in the BGSU Athletic Department.  If they called and made an offer right now, I'd take it.  As a sidenote, walking out of Spring Hill on the last day was quite an experience.  All the employees met on the main campus one morning and were informed that operations were being halted.  The people in my department knew, but not everyone on the main campus did.  As for myself, I was mostly indifferent, as I had been planning to quit at the end of the summer anyway (and if they hadn't gone out of business, and I had ended up leaving that job to move to BG and take this job, I would have been highly irritated with myself).  A lot of the employees were devastated, though.  Some of them (my boss among them) had worked there their entire adult lives, and now it was gone.  Compared to that, I'm sure my last day here will be a picnic.

      I just realized I've been at my current job two years as of today.  This means I should shoot myself.  In honor of this momentous occasion, I thought I would list some of the things I like about my job.  You know, since I mostly bitch about it.  * I work very close to the airport.  Airplanes fascinate me, and sometimes I get to see them up close as they're coming in to land.  Sometimes Air Force jets do maneuvers over there, and that's pretty cool to watch.  I have a big window in my office that looks in that direction, and that's nice.  * I have a lot of free time here, so I can do a lot of writing (as you've noticed), internet surfing, etc.  This is all stuff I don't have to spend time doing at home, which leaves me free to do other things I need or want to do.  * I like some of my coworkers.  Yeah, that's about it.

      I made another trip to Stow to visit Brandi last night, and thus another trip back to Toledo this morning.  This, of course, meant another $9.60 in tolls ($4.80 each way, for 128 miles) and another four hours spent on the Ohio Turnpike.  I've paid a pretty significant amount of money in tolls since Brandi moved to Stow, but I find that I don't mind so much.  I think the tolls help to keep the traffic down, as people find alternate routes to avoid paying if possible.  That makes for a more pleasant drive.  They also take really good care of the turnpike, which has been a definite plus this winter.  There was never much fear of being unable to make the drive due to snow or ice, because the road crews are always out in force whenever there's a threat of adverse conditions.  Also--and I have no idea if this is toll-related or not, although I tend to think it is, at least to a point--there generally aren't too many state troopers checking your speed on the turnpike.  Besides being able to worry a little less about being pulled over myself, this is another factor that helps traffic flow much more quickly.  One thing that is clear on these frequent trips is that spring is definitely approaching.  As we get closer to the Spring Equinox (one month from this coming Friday), I'm doing less and less driving in the dark.  The days are getting longer:  the sun is setting later and rising earlier, and I have a chance to mark the changes since I make this drive in the evenings and mornings.  I'm glad to be doing more of the drive under the sunlight.  Driving in the dark doesn't bother me per se, but in the daylight there's more to see.  Some may not consider the plains of northern Ohio to be all that scenic, but I happen to enjoy it quite a bit.  One thing I saw yesterday--something else that indicates the coming of spring--was birds.  A lot of birds.  At one point, I saw two flocks of Canadian geese flying next to each other.  Canadian geese always fly in a V-formation, which fascinates me.  These two flocks were next to each other, and some individual birds on the fringes of each flock kept switching back and forth, and the formations kept re-forming to accommodate them.  It was quite a sight.  To me, there's just something cool about being able to look out over the flatlands when the sun is rising or setting.  You can see pretty far, and the horizon is filled with color.  In Ohio, you look out over a lot of farmland and small towns--plenty of country roads and water towers.  I like that; it's peaceful.  Of course, I have a thing for the sky, especially during dusk or dawn.  The layers of color just blow me away.  The setting sun was glowing a fierce red in my rearview mirror as I drove east last night.  The swirls of cloud running through everything just put on the finishing touches.  This is the sort of thing I would love to be able to take photographs of.  Unfortunately, driving along at 70 mph (this number has been changed to protect the innocent) barely offers me enough time to look around, let alone take pictures.

      As of right now, there is no cable television, internet service, or newspaper delivery at Brandi's apartment.  Anything that happens in the news while I'm at her place often escapes my attention until I get back to Toledo.  Thus it was that I heard nothing of Alex Rodriguez being traded from the Texas Rangers to the New York Yankees all weekend.  Apparently the trade went down on Saturday; I didn't hear about it until Monday morning, as I was driving back to Toledo to go to work from Brandi's place in Stow.  I switched over to listen to "Mike and Mike in the Morning" on ESPN Radio, and they were talking about it.  At first, I thought they were joking.  A-Rod to the Yankees...are you kidding me?  The fact that I thought they were joking, I think, says a lot about how ludicrous this whole situation is.  I hate the Yankees more than any other professional sports organization, because they're ruining the competitive balance of a sport I love.  It seems like a joke because it's so blatant.  When the Yankees need or want someone, they just go get him, and price is no object.  Most other teams don't have that luxury.  If you want to look at it in terms of numbers, it goes something like this.  New York's payroll for this upcoming season will reportedly approach $200 million.  Contrast that with my own favorite team, the Cincinnati Reds, who may or may not approach $50 million.  That won't be the lowest in the league, either.  The huge gap in payroll sizes means that each year some teams open spring training essentially knowing that they won't be competing for the World Series.  No other major sport has this problem.  I can't fault the Yankees for doing what they're doing.  George Steinbrenner wants to win all the time, and he has the money to spend to make this more likely.  Good for him.  The main problem is that baseball's rules allow this to happen, and I hate the Yankees because they're the most visible symbol of the game's problems, and because it always bothers me after a while when a certain team wins all the time.  The success (popularity and profitability) of any sport depends naturally upon competition.  That's what sports are all about, after all.  That's why the NFL is so wildly popular right now:  all teams start the season on level ground, knowing they have a chance to win it all, and even a losing team can beat a winning team on any given day.  Major League Baseball doesn't have that right now.  Sure, every now and then a team like the Marlins will sneak up on everyone, but if you look at World Series appearances and victories over the past decade, it's overwhelmingly dominated by the Yankees.  One major issue, of course, is that this problem feeds itself.  Fans support winners, so the Yankees just keep making more money, which they can turn around and spend on better players.  On the other hand, teams like the Reds keep struggling through mediocre seasons, and the money dries up.  Not as many fans come to the games or watch on television, and it snowballs from there:  advertising revenues drop, concession sales, merchandise, parking, etc.  You have to spend money to make money, and nowhere is that more true than in baseball.  However, the reverse as also true, as obvious as it seems:  you have to make money to spend money.  I hate arguing this way, because we live in a capitalist society, and this is the way it's supposed to work in other businesses:  the quality product will thrive while others die off.  Sports aren't like other businesses, though.  In sports, your own product depends to a certain extent on the product of others.  Sure, Yankees fans think everything is wonderful, but if teams have to start folding up because they can't afford to compete, that's not going to be so great.  In baseball, you can't drive your competitors out of business, because then your own product goes away.  Baseball needs a salary cap in place to prevent this worst-case scenario from happening.  Of course, they probably should also institute a salary floor, to make sure teams are spending a certain amount of money on payroll for their team.  Right now baseball does have a luxury tax, where teams spending more than a certain amount have to pay a penalty which is shared among the other teams (as of now, the Yankees are the only ones paying this tax).  There's no rule stating that such money has to be spent by those teams on payroll, however; the Reds, for instance, put their portion toward paying off their new stadium.  That's fiscally responsible, but the fans would have appreciated an upgrade in, say, starting pitching.

      Happy President's Day, everyone!  Of course, if you aren't a student, or someone who works at a bank or a post office, that probably doesn't mean much.  It certainly doesn't to me.  I'm sitting here at my desk once again, just like every other Monday.  I'd much rather be still in bed.  This blog aside, I'd probably be just as productive there--at least I'd be getting some rest.  Our company's manufacturing software has crashed (again), so I'm just sitting here with nothing to do until someone tells me the software is okay.  At any rate, President's Day is by far the less significant "holiday" of the past three days, so let's focus on the other one.  I do not love Valentine's Day.  For the most part, I feel it's a shameless marketing ploy by Hallmark (etc.) to get consumers to spend money on cards and gifts during the stretch of time between Christmas and Easter, which is otherwise barren of significant holidays.  For what it's worth, Sweetest Day is the same, only worse.  The unreformed idealist in me would like to think that it's not really necessary to have one or two days to set aside to make your loved one feel special, because you should aim for that every day.  Of course, in reality, it probably  is  necessary, but that same part of me says that one or two days shouldn't make up for the other three hundred and sixty-some.  Needless to say, these arguments don't exactly go over well with the female portion of my relationship, so Brandi and I did Valentine's Day this weekend, and it was a pretty good one.  I drove over to Stow from Toledo immediately after work on Friday, arriving around 7:00.  Brandi and I went to dinner that night at the Cheesecake Factory.  Original plans called for Olive Garden, but she was planning to make pasta for us on Saturday night, so we decided to forego the Italian food on Friday.  The Cheesecake Factory is set in the middle of a pretty big shopping district near Cleveland, and it was pretty busy.  We had to wait over 45 minutes in the foyer for a table, and it was very cold.  We waited it out, though, and had a good time.  We got goofy, as we tend to do, and laughed a lot.  That's always good.  The food was decent, if not spectacular, but the cheesecake (Godiva chocolate) lived up to its billing, considering the place is named for it.  Saturday was Valentine's Day proper, of course.  For all intents and purposes, it started with a basketball game, as my beloved BG Falcons played at Kent State.  Kent State is only about five minutes from Brandi's place, so there was no chance I was missing this one since I was in the area anyway.  I'm sorry to say that this was Brandi's first time seeing BG's basketball team, but hopefully I can coax her to more games now that she's seen what it's all about.  Alas, the Falcons lost, but it was a pretty good game.  On a sidenote, Brandi and I mananged by pure accident to stumble immediately into a section where a group of BG students were sitting.  Wearing orange, we were greeted with a round of applause, which is probably the first and last time I'll be applauded just for coming in somewhere to find a seat.  From the game, we proceeded through some incomprehensible traffic snags back to Brandi's apartment, where we exchanged our gifts.  I tend to look for practical or useful gifts, so I do flowers only rarely--this was met with some disappointment, but I think I acquitted myself nicely.  I may be the only one with that view, but so be it.  I gave Brandi a Sony Discman that she can use when she works out, along with a pair of rechargeable batteries so she doesn't have to buy them once a week.  In return, I was given a BG football jersey #21, which is currently being worn by wide receiver Cole Magner.  BG sports paraphernalia always goes over quite well with me.  After that was dinner, which was awesome.  Brandi is a heck of a cook, which I enjoy quite a bit.  She made chicken fettucine alfredo, which was really, really good.  We originally planned to go see a movie after dinner, but we ended up drinking quite a bit of wine, so we stayed home instead.  Sunday was a day just to get some things taken care of, at least to start with.  We ran around for a bit doing laundry, getting haircuts, shopping, etc.  We finally got around to eating at about 4:00, when we went to BW3s in Kent.  Lo and behold, the Daytona 500 was on.  I just don't understand the NASCAR phenomenon; I know a lot of people dig it, but it's just not my thing.  Seriously.  I'll say this about BW3s on a race day:  it didn't feel like a college bar anymore, and Brandi and I will be checking our local listings before going in there on a Sunday in the future.  That night we went to a local Borders, which is always a good time for me.  I love books, and I love bookstores.  I hate haircuts, hate them--I'm using the word  hate  about haircuts--so it was nice to balance it out with a book-buying binge.  I managed to keep myself pretty much under control.  I got four books for myself, plus one for Brandi.  You'll be seeing them listed in my "What I'm Reading Now" section in the coming weeks.  All in all, it was quite a nice weekend--filled with lots of laughs, which is always my main interest.  Also, I got a sweet BG jersey, which will go nicely with my BG helmet when it finally arrives.

      Today is a beautiful day for February.  The sun is out, there isn't a cloud in the sky (although you can see the smog on the horizon, if you  want  something to be picky about), and it's warm.  Not April-warm, you know, but February-warm.  It's currently 41° where I work (according to weather.com), which is downright agreeable when you consider that I had to defrost my car before I could go anywhere this morning.  Unfortunately, for the next 3.5 hours I'm only going to be able to enjoy this beautiful day through the large window in my office.  Of course, I can't really complain too much.  If I wasn't at work, I'd likely be enjoying this beautiful day through the windows of my apartment, as I sat on the couch playing NCAA Football on PlayStation2.  I did get to enjoy the day for a few minutes on my lunch break, at least.  I still had a few minutes left when I got back from Wendy's, so I rolled down the windows on my car to feel the breeze while I listened to some music.  The CD in my car stereo right now is the greatest hits of Huey Lewis and the News, which I think is perfect for days like this.  It's feel-good music.  I only had a few minutes, but it was nice to have those few minutes to myself, to sit and revel in the music and the day.  I just wish the rest of my lunch hour was like that.  Today I ate at Wendy's, which generally makes for a good lunch break no matter what else happens.  The food and service was good today, so I have no complaints about that.  What got on my nerves is that today was apparently "Bring Your Three-Year-Old to Wendy's" Day, and no, I didn't get that memo.  If I had, I would have visited another Wendy's (lucky me, there are two of them nearby).  Children drive me crazy.  The high-pitched voice of a toddler is piercing:  it cuts through the din of a crowded restaurant and assails my ears like fingernails on a chalkboard.  That's just when they talk, which they rarely do.  Normally they scream and yell, which makes me want to puncture my own eardrums to lessen the suffering.  Never, even if I sat in front of my computer screen for a million years, could I describe my feelings about children any better than ESPN's  urlLink Sports Guy , Bill Simmons.  Take it away, Bill:   Here's the deal with kids: When you get married, your other friends who have kids tell you, "It's great, you have to do it, it's the best experience you'll ever have."  And then they spend the next 15 minutes telling you how they don't sleep, they get up three times a night, their kids keep getting them sick, they haven't left the house in three months, they stink like diapers, they can't find a good babysitter, they never have sex, and they don't have time to watch TV, follow sports, play sports, go to the movies or basically do anything at all. Really, it sounds fantastic.  I have a theory on this: I think 90 percent of parents can't believe how miserable they are, so they make a secret pact and try to get everyone else to have kids, just so everyone else is in the same boat and they don't have to hear stories about four-course dinners, Vegas trips, romantic getaway weekends and everything else. They're like Jim Jones in Guyana -- "Drink the Kool-Aid, seriously, it's phenomenal! You have to try this!"   Bill Simmons, ladies and gentlemen.  While there are exceptions, it is my solemn contention that children aren't really people until they're maybe twelve or so.  Until that point, any line-crossing should cause them to be dispatched with extreme prejudice.  Okay, I'm kidding about that, but come on, what's wrong with some discipline?  It just seems like so many parents take their kids in public and then become totally oblivious to them, while the kids are running around, screaming, banging into things and people, and generally being as horrible and annoying as is humanly possible.  Now I'll let you in on a little secret, which compounds my problem:  babies stare at me.  By babies, I mean anyone under, say, five years old.  Most guys want to be babe magnets; I appear to be a  baby  magnet.  For some inexplicable reason, they're attracted to me.  Not in any sort of reverse-pedophilic sort of way, but in the sort of way that insects are attracted to light fixtures.  Or like cats always seem to flock to the person who is allergic to them.  They just know I don't like them, and delight in making me as uncomfortable as they can.  As a sidenote, animals also tend to really like me.  I don't mind that, though, as I actually  like  animals.  And okay, I really don't mind it when babies stare at me.  I think it's funny.  Everything else I talked about is truly annoying, though.

       urlLink BG Tops Toledo in OT   Well, it wasn't the 50-point beating I was hoping we would lay on them, considering they're our biggest rival and (as much as it pains me to type it) they've owned us lately.  It was, however, the type of game I wish Brandi could have come to, as Anderson Arena lived up to its nickname for the first time this season.  First, let me say that I had to sneak into the student section.  Occasionally they'll check student IDs to "make sure" that only BG students are sitting in the student section.  I hate it when they do that, because for the most part it's a general admission section, with the understanding that it's mostly students down there, and that most people will stand through the whole game, and be loud and crude.  Granted, I graduated from BGSU almost four full years ago, so I'm most assuredly no longer a student, and I get the concept of saving the student section for the students.  I get it.  On the other hand...the season is almost over, and the fact that the student section was somewhere close to full tells me that there were plenty of kids there for the first time, despite the fact that they've had all season to come out.  I, on the other hand, have been sitting in the same spot for the past seven seasons, and I've missed only a handful of games in that time (probably less than a handful).  A lot of kids end up in that section and don't want to stand and yell with the rest of us anyway.  I like getting loud and crazy--it's why I sit down there.  Hey, I've got season tickets for a reserved seat in a great spot.  If ever there comes a time when I don't want to stand and scream the whole time, I'll go sit up there.  I like sitting with the students, though.  It's not like I'm too old to fit in.  Hell, I'm louder than most of them (which would surprise many people who have never been to a basketball game with me).  Anyway, I ended up going upstairs and climbing over the guardrail down into the student section.  The event staff didn't seem to mind.  By the time the game started, they had realized the students weren't going to fill the section, and had started letting civilians in anyway.  I was already in there by then, though.  I wasn't about to wait until gametime and  hope  there were still seats left.  The student section, when it's close to capacity and pumped up, is what gives Anderson Arena its nickname.  The first row of students is pressed right up against the sideline (hence the "Sideline Squad" t-shirts that are given away once a year), and let me tell you, opposing players do NOT want to inbounds the ball from our side of the court.  There are no boundaries in between fans and players.  Our fans don't touch them, but they're right there in their ears.  It definitely creates an advantage, and when the crowd singles out one player on the other team to harass, it can really get into his head (are you listening, Andy Hipsher?  We still hate you.  We hope to see you at Anderson in the MAC Tournament).  That's why Anderson is known as one of the toughest places in the country for an opposing team to play.  At any rate, it was a good game.  The rivalry, the closeness of the game, and the charged atmosphere made it a lot of fun.  As I said, this is the type of game I wish Brandi could have come to for her first game at Anderson Arena, so she could have a better feel for why I love it so much.

      Being around a bunch of people I hadn't seen in a long time yesterday at Grandma's funeral, I started missing Troy quite a bit.  Feeling a bit nostalgic anyway, I decided to just cruise around town while I was there, visiting some memories from the past.  Here are some of the highlights.  First off, I was part of the funeral procession and went to the cemetery for a brief graveside service.  Troy is an interesting place, in that I wouldn't exactly call it a small town (population > 20,000), but it really does have a small-town feel to it.  It's a community.  Driving through Riverside cemetery, I saw a lot of names I recognized.  Not that I knew the people personally, but I recognized the family names, just through growing up in Troy, going to high school there, and keeping up with local news even now that I live elsewhere.  I found it pretty interesting.  Sometime when I'm home for a weekend, perhaps this spring, I think I'd like to take a walk through the cemetery and just look around at the names on the markers.  The post-funeral lunch gathering was held at a church in Tipp City.  That particular town happens to be home to Spring Hill Nurseries, which is where I used to be employed.  I decided to drive by and check it out.  The garden center was in full swing.  The parking lot was full, and the store seemed to be doing a brisk business.  They're probably doing a lot of shipping right now, getting bulbs and plants out so people can plant them for this fall.  The building where our Merchandising Department was located, though, was not so prosperous.  It's vacant and up for sale, and I'd be surprised if it's been used since SHN went out of business.  Sad, but not entirely unexpected.  When I came back into Troy, one of the first places I drove past was Troy Memorial Stadium, where the Trojans play on Friday nights during the fall.  I never miss an opportunity to visit the stadium when I'm in town.  I love Troy football, and the stadium holds lots of good memories for me.  It's undergone some significant renovation in the past year, and I'm still getting used to the new look.  I started going to Troy games with Rachel when she was in high school and I was in junior high.  I haven't missed a Trojan home game since 1991, when I was a freshman in high school.  That's where my love of football began.  I've taken plenty of friends there with me, and I've gone to plenty of games by myself.  I love being there.  Directly across the street from the stadium is Troy High School itself, from which I graduated in 1995.  It doesn't seem like I spent only four years there, or that it was over almost nine years ago.  I still have a pretty fair number of friends from high school.  I have a lot of memories there as well.  Not all of them are good, of course, but I would say the vast majority of them are.  I know very few people who can say this, but if I was given the opportunity to go back to high school, I would do it in a heartbeat.  Essentially next door to the stadium is Hobart Arena.  The THS hockey team plays there now, and it's also where graduation ceremonies are held.  I spent a lot of time there when I was younger, as Troy used to be home to a semi-professional hockey team (the Troy Sabres, who later became the Miami Valley Sabres).  Uncle Clarence and Aunt Lou would always take Rachel and me to the games.  My favorite player was #77, Bernie Chivarelli (I'm sure I spelled that wrong).  The games were a blast.  The THS hockey coach is Rick Szabo, and he was the Sabres' goalie.  I like going to the high school games now when I can.  Just being in the arena and experiencing the way sights, sounds, and smells of hockey bring back a lot.  The arena, like the stadium, has undergone quite a lot of renovation, but the heart of it is still the same.  I'm glad to report that "The Pissing Man" is still there.  On top of the arena, above the entryway, there is a small structure that looks, in profile, like a man taking a leak.  I can't explain it, but it's there.  It was pointed out to me by a classmate on the bus on the way home from junior high one day, and now I can't drive by the arena without looking for it.  In the same neck of the woods is the house where Uncle Clarence, Aunt Lou, and Rachel used to live.  I spent a lot of time there as a kid, so I drove by to check it out.  I almost didn't recognize it, to be honest.  One of the houses next door is now gone.  The house itself has been re-sided.  The garage behind the house is still blue, though, and the driveway is still lined with stone.  I always had a lot of fun there when I was younger.  Since I was in the neighborhood, I drove by Grandma's old house as well.  It looked the same as it always has, except I'm pretty sure there's a different fence around the yard now.  From there, I drove through Duke Park, where I had my first job, working the concession stand for softball games during the summer after I graduated from high school.  That was a decent job, for the most part.  My main complaint was just dealing with kids whose parents were too occupied to pay them much mind.  Other than that, it was fun.  I was outside in the summer, but not out in the sun.  I got to watch some softball, and often I knew some of the people playing.  I got all the pop, candy, and hot dogs I could handle.  Also, the boss didn't mind if I had friends join me, so I often did.  I really like being at the park.  It's one of my favorite places in Troy.  After that I headed over to Troy's west side, where there are a lot of changes being made.  After immersing myself in the past for a while, I wanted to go over there and see some new stuff, some of the progress that's happening.  Our local Wal-Mart is becoming a Super Wal-Mart, and I wanted to see the construction and what it was doing to the rest of the plaza.  I was dismayed to see that the plaza's bookstore, Little Professor, was no longer there.  Otherwise, not much was changed.  There are some new apartment buildings going up behind Wal-Mart, so I went that way to check them out, and I discovered that Little Professor had put up their own building and was now housed back there as well.  The opportunity to check out a new bookstore was too much for me to pass up, so I went inside.  I was immediately faced with a book called  Schoolboy Trojans , which seems to pertain to Troy football in the 50s.  I picked that up, of course, and I'm excited to read it.  I'm sure I'll be writing about it in detail at a later date, once I've finished it.  There was a time, when those apartment buildings were first announced, that I could see myself looking there for housing.  While that's still a possibility on some level, I think that by the time I could possibly be ready to move back to Troy, I would be looking for an actual house.  And I can't say with any type of certainty that a move to Troy is forthcoming at any point in the future, as I've also grown quite fond of Bowling Green.  At this point, though, I have to say that it's a possibility.

      My abstention from writing yesterday was due to spending the day in Troy for a funeral.  First off, let's get the familial explanations out of the way, so I can proceed without running around in circles trying to explain exactly how everyone is or is not related.  Frankie Vanover, the deceased, is not actually my grandmother, but I've called her "Grandma" all my life.  Her daughters are Billie and Louise, who are known to me as Aunt Bill and Aunt Lou.  Aunt Bill is married to my Uncle Mike, who is my dad's brother, so she actually is my aunt.  Aunt Lou, being her sister, is not technically a relation, since the connection is by marriage.  However, Aunt Bill is the one who took care of me when I was younger while my parents were at work, and she and Aunt Lou are very close, so I spent a lot of time with both of them.  Aunt Lou and her husband (Uncle Clarence) have a daughter (Rachel) who is a just a few years older than I am, and we grew up together.  The point I'm trying to get across is this:  technically, I'm not related to Aunt Lou, Uncle Clarence, and/or Rachel, but they are all  family , in the more important sense of the word.  Also, Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill have a son named Mike, who also has a son named Mike.  For clarity's sake, although he isn't nearly as crazy as he used to be, the middle Mike will henceforth be referred to by his old nickname, "Crazy Mike," and his son Mike, who is only a few years younger than me and is a close friend as well as an actual blood relative, will just be known as Mike.  Now that we're all clear on that (sure we are), a story.  A couple of years ago, my mom and I went with Aunt Bill and Aunt Lou to go visit Grandma at the nursing home.  She had Alzheimer's disease, and it had been a while since I had seen her.  They told me she probably wouldn't recognize me, as she often didn't recognize people, even the people she saw frequently.  So we went in and walked into her room, and she got a big smile on her face and said, "Well, there's Jon!"  Being around that side of the family as much as I was when I was younger, I was one of her favorites.  Spending so much time with Rachel, who actually was her granddaughter, I was like one of the grandchildren.  In fact, I found out yesterday that I was actually counted among the grandchildren.  That made me feel pretty good.  At any rate, I took the day off from work and drove down to Troy for the funeral.  I'm really glad I did.  I wanted to be there for my family, and I could tell it meant a lot to them that I made it.  We get together only rarely, and it was good to see a lot of people I hadn't seen in a long time.  It just sucks that someone had to die for it to happen.  I make it into Troy only infrequently now, so I don't see Aunt Bill and Uncle Mike or Aunt Lou and Uncle Clarence and Rachel nearly as much as I used to.  Crazy Mike lives in Pennsylvania now, I think, so I definitely don't see him very often.  Also present was my cousin Dave (another son of Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill), who lives in the area but is mostly MIA.  These guys are quite a bit older than I am, and because of the age difference, this was the first time I can recall that I could sit down and talk to them and actually relate to them.  Rachel, Mike, and I used to play Atari games with Dave years ago, but that wasn't quite the same.  Another person I saw for the first time in quite a while was Rachel's cousin Tonia.  Tonia and I are exactly one week apart in age (she being the older), and as she was also around fairly often when we were younger, we were always teased about having crushes on each other.  I can't speak for Tonia (although I do think it was true at one point or another), but as for myself, I think enough time has passed now that I feel comfortable admitting that it was true through junior high and into the early part of high school.  Nothing ever came of it, but we were close friends while we were in high school.  I hadn't seen her since Rachel got married a few years ago, and now she's married and pregnant.  I'm glad I could be there for everyone, and I did enjoy seeing them, despite the circumstances.  Being with everyone brought back a lot of good memories of my youth, and the time I spent with Uncle Mike and Aunt Bill, and with Uncle Clarence, Aunt Lou, and Rachel, often with Mike and Tonia.  It's really amazing to think back on times like that and think about how much stuff has changed, and how much has stayed the same.  At one point I saw Crazy Mike and Dave exchange a private joke, and just look at each other and laugh, and it reminded me so much of how it is now between me, Rachel, and Mike.  We don't see each other often, but we shared so much growing up and have so many common experiences that even now we can just exchange glances and private jokes and be right back on the same wavelength.  It all made me feel really lucky for the circumstances that allowed me to be so close to these people and consider them family even when they aren't all blood relations.  Blood is overrated.  It's shared experiences and love that makes a real family, and nothing else.  All of these people have meant so much to my life, and I'm grateful for that.  I didn't always feel lucky as a kid, but that's the nature of youth.  Now that I can look back on it I realize how great it was to be surrounded by such wonderful people.  Being there, surrounded by these people and memories for my childhood, I spent a good portion of the afternoon just cruising the streets of Troy, visiting old haunts and revisiting old times.  More on that later.

       urlLink Frances ''Frankie'' Vanover   It seems as though this week may be taking a bit of a detour.  If I can swing it, I'll probably be driving down to Troy tonight for the funeral tomorrow.  Although I hadn't seen her lately, she was often an important part of my growing up.  I want to be there to pay my respects, to both her and to my family.

      Okay, who besides me remembers rapper/one-hit wonder Snow?  His one hit, "Informer," was popular at some point in the early 90s.  I was one of the lucky ones who actually paid money for the CD,  12" of Snow  (which includes the song "Lonely Monday Morning," which provided the title for this entry).  Over the years, I've thinned my CD collection a couple of times by selling some of them to used CD stores, but I've kept that one, and I still listen to it from time to time.  The songs are so terrible, lyrically, that you can't help but find them amusing.  When you can understand what he's saying, of course.  And a lonely Monday morning it is.  Monday mornings are always a little rough.  I hate getting up at 7:00 a.m. anytime, let alone after two days of sleeping in.  Getting out of bed and leaving for work this morning brought about the end of a good weekend with Brandi, and I likely won't see her again until Saturday.  There are certainly better ways for a week to start.  I really can't complain too much, though, because as I said, the weekend that ended this morning was a good one.  It started, for all intents and purposes, on Thursday evening.  Brandi had a bit of a financial windfall, and thus decided to come to Bowling Green that night and stay for the weekend.  That was nice:  I certainly don't mind driving to Stow, but it's good to occasionally have a weekend when I don't have to.  Besides that, I wasn't planning to go to Stow until Saturday afternoon, after the BGSU basketball game.  With Brandi deciding to come on Thursday, we got two extra days.  Weekend highlights:  We went out to dinner on Friday night at Easystreet Cafe in downtown Bowling Green.  It's one of our favorite places to eat, and since Brandi is in BG so infrequently, I didn't want to miss the opportunity.  We went pretty late--it was after 9:00--but we still had to wait for a table.  That was fine, because it gave us a chance to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine.  Through dinner, we debated whether or not we wanted to go out afterwards for drinks.  About halfway through her second glass of wine, Brandi decided she was ready to go.  So, after dinner we headed over to BW3, intending just to kick back and relax, listen to some tunes and have a few drinks.  As it happened, we ran into some friends (Adam, Jamie, and Mike and Charissa), so we ended up joining them.  We hung out there for a while, then went en masse to another bar called Downtown.  It was pretty crowded there--that can make it fun, but it can also make it a real pain to get a drink, especially when you've got a jackass behind the bar who only waits on females.  That aside, it was a lot of fun to hang out with everyone for a while.  Brandi and I finished the night at Uptown, which is a dance club right above Downtown (clever, yes?).  As a sidenote, I'm discovering that I have a higher alcohol tolerance than I have any business having, given the size of my body and my relative inexperience with drinking.  I had seven drinks on Friday night, and never a hint of a buzz.  Saturday essentially began with Brandi's first trip to Anderson Arena, as the Bowling Green Falcons took on the Youngstown State Penguins in an ESPN Bracket Buster game.  It was fun, as games at Anderson have a tendency to be, but it could have been better.  The Falcons won going away, despite a couple of injuries, and the crowd was small and lackluster.  I wanted it to be more exciting so Brandi could get the full effect, but it was not to be.  I think she had fun, but it could have been better.  I wish she could make it to the game coming up this Wednesday, which is against our hated archrivals, the great unwashed, the Toledo Rockets.  I sincerely hope we can pack "The House That Roars" for that one, at least.  The game was followed by a trip to Wal-Mart for some necessities.  That was quite irritating.  Apparently Wal-Mart has stopped allowing debit MasterCards to be used as credit cards, which is how they're supposed to be used.  They now make you enter your PIN number to use them.  The kicker, of course, is that my card, for whatever reason, won't allow itself to be used that way, so it kept rejecting my PIN, and I ended up having to use an actual credit card.  Something is going to have to be done about this--the great thing about such a debit card is that it can be used so easily, and if it's going to be such a pain in the ass, we might as well go back to writing checks.  Anyway, that night we ended up going out to dinner again.  We thought about going to Olive Garden, which is another of our favorites, but didn't really feel like driving to Toledo.  Eventually we remembered that there's a new Italian place in downtown Bowling Green, so we decided to check it out.  First, though, we stumbled into another place, called Cohen & Cooke--it's another new place downtown, so we thought it was what we were looking for.  It wasn't:  too high priced, and you didn't seem to be able to choose what you got.  Once we got a look at the menu, we were out of there.  The Italian place was a few doors down, and it's called Cucina di Betto.  Trust me, this place deserves a paragraph all to itself.  It was incredible.  The service was great, and the food was awesome.  As usual, we started with a glass of wine.  Then they brought out a basket of bread, with a seasoned olive oil dipping sauce, and our salads.  I love a good salad, and this one was really good--a good variety of vegetables, including some yellow pepper, which was excellent.  All the veggies were fresh and crispy, as were the croutons.  For dinner, I ordered chicken marsala, and I got the best chicken marsala I've ever had (and that's saying something).  The chicken was very tender, the dish was covered in mushrooms, and the sauce had a slightly nutty flavor.  Brandi was equally pleased with her dinner, which was portabella ravioli.  My only critique is that their menu could offer a bit more selection.  Other than that, it was outstanding, and I highly recommend this place.  No, I'm not a professional restaurant reviewer, but apparently I play one on the internet.  Sunday was a pretty laid-back kind of day, which is what Sundays are for.  I watched the first half of the Cavs-Knicks game, as I always try to catch Lebron when I get a chance.  After that we went over to the Wood County Humane Society to hang out with some cats.  Brandi really loves cats, and I like them pretty well myself, although I tend to identify myself as more of a dog person.  Unfortunately, neither of us is allowed to have pets in our respective apartments, so we visit the Humane Society from time to time to get our fix.  Animals are just funny, and even moreso when there's an entire room full of them (two rooms, actually).  At one point, Brandi crouched down to pet one cat, and another cat leapt up onto her back, and was thinking about climbing on top of her head before I plucked it off (the cat, that is; not Brandi's head).  Another cat was hanging out in the sink.  Some of this stuff you just have to see to know how funny it is.  There was one cat we both really liked, a gray one named Doc.  He was sleeping when we first got there, but Brandi eventually petted him awake.  He was pretty calm and lovable, and sat on both of our laps for a while.  Of course, that meant Brandi talked about him for the rest of the day.  The only other really notable thing about Sunday (besides a nice long nap upon arriving home from the Humane Society) was the weather.  Mostly sunny, calm (which is a big deal for Bowling Green, which is normally extremely windy), and pretty warm for a day in February.  It inspired a trip to Dairy Queen, and we took a walk later in the evening, onto campus and around town.  After all that, I had to come to work today.  What a letdown.  This should be a good week, though.  Tonight I'm just going to chill out and relax; on Tuesday night, I think I'm hitting the town with a friend for Mardi Gras; Wednesday I get to watch the Falcons defuse the Rockets; Thursday is a  possible  roadtrip to go see the Troy Trojans play in the first round of the Ohio High School Division I tournament.  On Friday, of course, I get the rev the whole thing up again.

      Wow, that was fast.  Our owner/president just came back into the office, along with his fiancee, and they were bearing a cake frosted with the words "It's Over."  I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'll guess that refers to the divorce proceedings.  Outstanding.  Now hopefully we can go back to being civil human beings.

      Did I have to come back from lunch today?  It's cleared up some since this morning, and it's really nice out there.  Windy, but temperate.  I'm not a huge outdoorsy person, but today I'd like to be outside.  I did get to enjoy it for a few minutes on my lunch break.  Between that, some good food, and the writing I did this morning, I think I'm cured of my irritation.  Since it's Friday afternoon, I thought I'd give a quick recap of some things that have been going on around me this week.  This is really just a clever way of pawning off another random column, without having to think of a rhyme to put into the title.  I passed a DeLorean on the interstate this morning on the way to work.  How cool is that?  I don't know if I've seen one in person before.  They're not very common.  I glanced over as I passed, and the driver was neither Christopher Lloyd nor Michael J. Fox.  There probably isn't even a flux capacitor in there.  I'd have one, if I owned a DeLorean.  I could swear that Tony Kornheiser was talking yesterday on his radio show about something I wanted to mention, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.  I hate that.  Instead, I'll just mention that Tony is leaving his ESPNRadio show on March 26, which makes me very sad.  I only get to listen for a few minutes each day, but it's a smart show, and I really look forward to it.  They say the guy replacing him is good, but I doubt it'll be  as  good.  I guess Tony is going to try to get a local Washington D.C. radio gig...maybe it'll be available on the Internet.  One thing I do remember hearing on the radio yesterday was Paul Harvey mentioning  Harry Potter  author J.K. Rowling.  It was a brief mention in a loud restaurant, so I couldn't hear exactly what he said, but I thought he said she was planning to write more Potter books after the seventh one.  I thought that was the best entertainment news I had heard since it was announced that the  Star Wars  classic trilogy is coming to DVD.  I needed confirmation, though, so I Googled it at home last night.  I found a  urlLink transcript from an online chat  Ms. Rowling gave yesterday for World Book Day, in which someone asked her if she was going to write more than seven Potter books.  Her response was that she didn't plan to, but that she wouldn't rule it out totally.  So it's a possibility, but I hardly think it was worth being on the Paul Harvey show.  Ohio State is raising ticket prices for this upcoming football season to $57 per seat.   $57 per seat!   Wow, that's a lot.  To put it in perspective, when I buy my  season  ticket for BGSU Falcon football this fall, it might cost $57 or thereabouts, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if it's less.  By the way, Bowling Green absolutely has to be the best dollar value for football in the nation.  If you come to a game at BG, you can get in the gate for probably $10 (the prices may increase some this year, but I doubt it'll be much more), and you get to see a nationally-ranked Division I football team.  ESPN Gameday came to the stadium last year.  It was awesome.  I buy my tickets with a smile.  And  our  stadium personnel is always friendly, even to fans of visiting teams, unlike some university in Columbus which shall remain nameless.  I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but the owner/president of the company where I work is currently going through high-stakes divorce proceedings.  Earlier this week his estranged wife won a significant victory in said proceedings, and upon his return to the office he came down and started complaining loudly to our Marketing Director (to whom he'll be getting married as soon as his divorce is final) and our Office Manager.  He followed up his complaints with a graphic description of some physical violence he'd like to inflict upon his soon-to-be ex-wife.  He said it in jest, but I found it entirely inappropriate, in that he was talking loudly and essentially broadcasting it throughout our offices.  It was disturbing.  Even more disturbing...somehow word got around (go figure), and the next day I overheard one of our shop guys also talking about inflicting his own physical violence upon her.  What in the hell is that all about?  I'd like to think he said it in jest as well, but I don't even understand what business it is of his in the first place.  This divorce stuff has been going on for a long time, so we all have heard something about it, but even the little bit we know is only one side of the story.  Yes, I understand that this divorce case may directly influence all of us as employees, as one of the items in contention is the very ownership of this company, and if she should win, our futures would be up in the air.  Still, I hardly think that possibility makes it okay for him to run his mouth like he knows what he's talking about.  One way or another, it will be a great day when all of this divorce crap is over.  Supposedly that will be this month or next, but I'm not holding my breath.  On my way out to lunch today, I heard the tornado sirens going off.  I consulted with one of my co-workers about this, and apparently they always test them on the first Friday of each month.  Where I'm from, they do it on Wednesdays.  I think they should standardize this, personally.  At any rate, it just seems to me like they could find a better time to do their testing than on an incredibly windy day when tornado season is not too far off.  One more thing of note:  my Troy Trojans are playing their second game in the state basketball tournament, tonight at UD Arena (University of Dayton) vs. Stebbins High School.  If they win that game (which they should), they'll play Sunday vs. Vandalia Butler, a team they've already beaten once this season.  Also, Troy's bowling team, undefeated in its first year of existence, has qualified for the state tournament, and I think that's also happening this weekend.  Their head coach happens to be someone I know from my own days of youth bowling, and a nice guy.  Good luck to the Trojans this weekend.

      This is always an interesting time to live in Ohio.  It's currently 67° outside, and it's expected to reach the low 70s this afternoon.  Yes, it's only March 5, and spring doesn't officially start for another 16 days.  If it does reach those temperatures, it'll break the record of 68° set back in 1894, I think.  That's pretty cool.  Of course, I wouldn't go quite so far as to say it's "nice" outside.  The temperature is awesome, but it's overcast and occasionally raining.  Oh, and have I mentioned the wind?  Gusts are reaching 50 miles per hour.  This is a windy section of the world (Bowling Green is actually developing a windmill farm to help power the town, which I think is an awesome idea...I'm going to write more about this eventually), but this is a lot of wind even by our standards.  Also, it's supposed to snow tomorrow.  Just flurries, no accumulation, but still...70s one day, snow the next.  Yep, this is Ohio in March.  I had a bit of a frustrating situation this morning.  It's over now, and it really wasn't that big of a deal in the first place, but I'm experiencing some residual irritation.  Since writing is cathartic for me, you get to hear all about it.  Tickets went on sale this morning for Cleveland Indians games.  Personally, I dislike the Indians.  I do, however, like the Cincinnati Reds, and the Reds are playing a series in Cleveland in June.  Cleveland is closer to Bowling Green than Cincinnati is, and I've never been to a game in Cleveland, so I decided to try to get tickets.  I went online and got to the ticketing website promptly at 9:00, which is when tickets were scheduled to start selling.  My first several attempts prompted "We're Sorry" responses, which indicated that they had a "high volume of transactions" and that I had to try again.  I wasn't exactly surprised by that, but it obviously didn't thrill me.  I was at least encouraged that the tickets went on sale when they were supposed to, and they weren't having any glitches.  After several tries, the site finally presented me with a set of tickets I could purchase.  However, the graphic which illustrates where the seats are located in the stadium would not come up, so I had no idea where the seats were located.  I tried to right-click on the graphic for the "Show Picture" option, but the site coders decided to disable that function.  A section number was listed for the seats, but I'm not familiar with Jacobs Field, and thus had no idea what that number meant.  I opened a new window and scrambled to find a seating chart for the stadium, but they only give you a minute and a half to decide if you want the tickets or not, so they timed out.  This kicked me back out to the main ticket screen, where I had to start all over again.  Again, I started getting the "We're Sorry" response.  After several tries of this, the screen stopped working.  Clicking the "Continue" button did nothing--it didn't even try to load a new page.  Conveniently, there are no navigation links from that window (and the right-click function is disabled), so I had to close the window and start all over once again.  "We're Sorry."  "We're Sorry."  "We're Sorry."  After about a million repetitions, I wanted to pound my head on my desk.  Eventually I got through again, and it gave me some more tickets I could purchase.  They happened to be what I was looking for, so I said I would take them.  Keep in mind, I'm doing all of this at work--I clicked away from the window for a moment to do some actual work, and when I came back to it I saw "This page cannot be displayed."  What?!?!  Wonderful.  I went back (right-click worked this time) and tried again, and was told that I had exceeded the allotted time and that my tickets had been released.  A certain amount of swearing took place at this point.  I tried again, and received several more heartfelt apologies, and finally got through once again.  They offered me another set of tickets, which actually turned out to be just a bit better than the ones I had procured just a few moments before.  I accepted them.  I didn't click away from the window this time--if it was going to screw up, I was at least going to watch it happen.  I'm pleased to report that this time it went off without a hitch, and I got the tickets.  Finally.  This whole process took about 45 minutes.  It probably wouldn't have taken that long if I had just called the ticket office, even including the time I would have had to spend on hold.  At least I got the tickets, and right now that's all I care about.  The Reds just better win that game, dammit.

      Yeah.  I was listening to Nirvana's  Nevermind  album on my way to work this morning.  What a great CD.  It came out in 1991, and I got it shortly thereafter.  I was 14 at the time.  Now, nearly thirteen years later, the music sounds as good as it ever did.  Better, actually.  That, my friends, is a classic CD.  It really is too bad Kurt Cobain isn't still around.  On the bright side, Dave Grohl (Nirvana's drummer) is making some good music with the Foo Fighters.  I was listening to that as I drove in on the turnpike from Stow, as I went to visit Brandi last night.  With her coming to BG the past couple of weekends, I hadn't been to her place for a while, so I thought I mid-week visit was in order.  We didn't get a whole lot of time together, because she didn't get home until around 9:00, but it was a good time nonetheless.  I've mentioned on here before that I don't buy flowers very often, but I stopped at a grocery store on my way into Stow and picked up some flowers for Brandi.  This is where I discovered that flowers have the ability to make all women swoon, whether said flowers are for them or not.  Three older ladies in the checkout line (the cashier, the bagger, and the lady ahead of me in line) all sighed and started talking to me when they saw I had flowers.  What a strange phenomenon.  After Brandi got home and got her flowers (they made her very happy), we went to BW3 for some food and to play their interactive trivia game.  That's always fun.  For my money, B-Dubs has the best chicken fingers (they call them "Buffalo Tenders") in the world, and I'm something of a chicken fingers expert.  We finished second in both trivia contests we played.  I like B-Dubs a lot.  Neither of us was drinking last night, but it's still a fun place to be.  The trivia games are fun, and there are always sporting events on TV.  It's a good atmosphere.  We go to the B-Dubs in Kent quite a bit when I'm in Stow, and we go to the one in BG almost every time Brandi is in town.  I think we'll be there a lot once she moves back.  Actually, we decided last night that I would drive to Stow on St. Patrick's Day and we'd hang out at B-Dubs that night.  That should be fun.  I can't stand the taste of beer, so I won't be drinking any, green or otherwise.  It'll be a good night to be out, though.  I'll probably try to go out the night before in Bowling Green.  Speaking of future plans, we've tentatively decided to go up to Cleveland on Saturday.  She mentioned the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, which sounded good to me since my one visit there was a couple of years ago.  The strange thing was that before she even brought it up, I had been thinking that I'd like to go to Cleveland this weekend.  It just sounded like fun.  We'll probably go on Saturday.  The Cavs have a home game that night, so we'll probably head over to Gund Arena and get some cheap seats for that one.  I'm going to be in Cleveland several times in the next few weeks, at least potentially.  This weekend isn't set in stone, but we don't have anything else going on, so it's probable.  The weekend after that is the MAC basketball tournament at Gund Arena, and I would really like to go to a game or two (hopefully BG can help me out by making it that far).  The weekend after THAT, Brandi and I have tickets to see Edwin McCain in concert at the Odeon Concert Club.  I've already seen Edwin perform live seven times, so I can say with some authority that it will be an excellent show.  On the topic of MAC basketball, I just want to note that Ball State did me the favor of defeating Eastern Michigan last night, which assures that my BG Falcons will host a first-round game in the MAC Tournament.  Whatever else happens, I'll get to see them play at least one more time this year.

      Couldn't think of a good rhyme today.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, there's nothing in particular on my mind today, so I thought I'd "treat" you to another installment of just random stuff.  I haven't done this for a little while, so I don't feel too bad about it.  Actually I never feel bad about it, but let's pretend sometimes I do.  * I have exquisite timing today.  Each time I've tried to go into the bathroom, someone else has gotten there just ahead of me.  It's uncanny.  * Something that really,  really  bothers me is when people just toss cigarette butts out their car windows, or just down on the ground if they're outside.  What in the hell are you doing?  This just shows a total lack of regard for the world around you.  I'm not a big-time environmentalist, but this is just common sense.  When I drive down Airport Highway, I can see the divider in the median just lined with discarded cigarette butts, and it's disgusting.  I'm probably not going to start carrying a firearm and shooting out people's back windows when they do this, but I'm tempted.  If you do this, STOP IT!!!  * Another thing I've noticed lately is people in the world of sports journalism dogging out  The Lord of the Rings  and people who enjoy it, even after admitting they've never seen the movies or read the books.  I can understand if fantasy fiction isn't their thing, but to totally degrade everyone who's into it is absurd.  You don't have to reinforce stereotypes about "dumb jocks" or "geeks."  Believe it or not, it  is  possible to like both.  I do.  * I actually have some work to do at work (gasp!) for the time being.  I don't know exactly why this particular duty has been assigned to the Purchasing Manager, but that's the way it's done, so I'm doing it.  That's not a complaint, by the way--it's not exciting work, but it's nice to have something to do.  It deals with calculating the amounts of certain chemicals we use for a report we have to file every year or so.  It's not hard, but there's a lot to it, and I'm kind of figuring it out as I go along.  * Of course, this means that there are just enough stupid little things going on to keep distracting me from working on this new project.  Lucky for me, I've got over a month to get it finished.  I don't think it'll take nearly that long.  * I'm starting to think that spring may actually be on the horizon.  The temperatures have been mild for almost a full week now, and they're expected to stay that way through the next several days.  I wouldn't be surprised if we get another blast of winter, but hopefully we won't.  * Besides the rising temperatures, another sure sign of warmer weather on the horizon is road construction.  While I haven't seen any actual roadwork going on as of yet, it's on its way.  The signs are already going up in Bowling Green.  Getting around town is going to be a bit of a hassle in the coming months.  They're going to widen Wooster St., which is one of the town's main streets.  It's long overdue, though, so you'll hear few complaints from me.  * Mmm, cookies!  I bought three chocolate-chip cookies yesterday with my sandwich at Subway and, silly me, I forgot to eat them.  I'm correcting that oversight right now.

      I have just learned that the officiating crew for last night's BG-WMU game was actually a crew from the Big Ten, and not from the MAC.  I would like to apologize to MAC officials for saying they were responsible for last night's horrible officiating performance.  I stand by my statement that they're generally not very good, though, and that they're KNOWN for being not very good.  Consider this:  last night's contest featured two MAC teams, so why use officials from a different conference?  It just so happens that the game was  televised  on Fox Sports Ohio.  Having the typically bad MAC officiating in front of a partisan crowd of 2,100 or so who are going to think the officials suck anyway isn't that big of a deal, but I'm guessing the conference administration had no desire to showcase it to a potentially large television audience.  Sure, the officiating sucked anyway, but at least now they have plausible deniability:  "well, they weren't  our  officials."

       urlLink Falcons lose ugly to Broncos   I was hoping this story would have a happier ending.  The first time I saw Kevin Netter play basketball, several years ago, I thought he would be a star.  He was a raw big man (6'-10") who could run the floor.  He had soft hands, quick moves, and a nice outside shot.  He was a little thin, but his frame suggested he could add some muscle and bang a little bit on the low post.  It seemed to be a perfect combination of skills for a player ready to explode into stardom in the Mid-American Conference.  Last night Kevin played in what was potentially his last game at Anderson Arena, having never quite lived up to his potential.  He spent much of the game as he has spent much of so many other games over the course of his career:  on the bench with foul trouble.  He played only 20 minutes, but still managed to lead the Falcons in scoring with 19 points.  That wasn't nearly enough, though, as BG played sloppy with the ball (20 turnovers!), and no one else could get going offensively.  Kevin is the ultimate "mystery wrapped in an enigma."  It seemed like his heart was in the right place, but his head usually wasn't.  He has all the talent and potential in the world, but never quite harnessed it.  He improved dramatically between his sophomore and junior seasons, and then seemed to hit a wall.  BG fans thought he would break out this year and be the dominant center in the MAC, and it just hasn't happened.  He's been too inconsistent.  One night he would come out on fire and play well on offense and defense, and the next night he would come out and pick up four fouls in ten minutes of playing time.  He became a serviceable player--capable of dominating almost any given game, but you just never knew what you were going to get from night to night.  I have to give Kevin a lot of credit, though.  It's not exactly a secret that he didn't get along with Coach Dakich, and in fact threw a party two years ago when Dakich accepted the head coaching position at West Virginia.  Of course, Dakich ended up changing his mind and returning to BGSU a week later, and I'm sure no one was more shocked than Kevin.  In that type of situation, it would have been easy for Kevin to leave the program, but he stuck it out.  I'm sure Coach was hard on him a lot of the time (and he can be pretty hard, from all accounts), because he wanted Kevin to live up to his potential, and Kevin took it all and kept playing.  I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Kevin has an NBA future.  The NBA has a tendency to draft based on potential, and I still maintain (as do many others) that Kevin has a ton of it.  I think he could have a career there, if he can bring himself to work hard and to focus.  That's the key word--focus.  Keep your head in the game, Kevin!  You can do it if you want to.  A few more thoughts about last night's game...  The officiating was terrible.  I just want to get that out of the way and move on.  It was ugly.  Touch fouls on one end, virtual assaults on the other with no call.  I don't get it.  Some of the calls (on both teams) were just bad.  MAC officials have a pretty low reputation nationally, and they lived up to it last night.  A note to certain members of the members of the Sideline Squad:  the rest of us arrive well before gametime in order to procure the spot where we want to stand.  That's the nature of general admission.  When you arrive after the National Anthem and expect other people to move for you, don't expect much sympathy.  No one cares that "this is where I've been for every game this year."  Trust me.  I've been occupying the same spot for almost every game for the past seven years, but I still have to get there early if I want to make sure I get it again.  Western Michigan's Ben Reed is a punk.  I don't condone violence, but if one of the Falcons had decided to whack him, I would have a hard time saying he didn't deserve it.  Too much of a showoff, too much jawing with our players and fans.  I can't say too much, because he did at least back it up with his play--he led all scorers with 24 points.  Still, he's not the kind of guy I'd want on my team.  He was recruited to play at BG, but I think it's best for all concerned that he ended up going elsewhere.  Coach Dakich runs a tight ship, and Mr. Reed would be well acquainted with Mr. Bench if he displayed such theatrics at BG.  All griping aside, BG was beaten last night by a better team.  We had our chances and just couldn't stay with them, and that's the ballgame.  The chances are still decent that the Falcons will get to host a game in the first round of the MAC Tournament.  I really hope they do, because I don't want our home schedule to end this way.  I may or may not make further rounds of the tournament, once it moves to Gund Arena in Cleveland, and I'd really like to see the guys play one more time.  I still think we've got a chance, and if we get hot and come together, there's no reason why we can't win the tournament and go to the Big Dance.  I'm not quite delusional enough to bank on it, but I'm not ruling it out, either.  Come on, Kevin.  Help make it happen.  We know you've got it in you.

      I have a love/hate relationship with my theater of choice.  When in Bowling Green, I generally go see movies at Showcase Cinemas Maumee.  Maumee is a suburb of Toledo, and the theater is about 20-30 minutes away from my apartment.  There are closer theaters--Bowling Green is home to the Cla-Zel theater, which is Ohio's oldest single-screen movie theater, and also to a five-screen Cinemark at the Woodland Mall.  However, if you're looking for a quality moviegoing experience, you can't beat Showcase.  That's why I choose to go there.  The problem is that it's so damned expensive.  Two admissions @ $9 each = $18, plus $3.95 (plus tax) for a large Mountain Dew and $5 (plus tax) for a large popcorn to share = $9.40, and the whole movie experience is almost $30.  That's a lot.  Still, that said, I pay it willingly, because going to a movie there is head and shoulders above going to a movie anywhere else nearby.  All of their screens feature stadium seating, which means you never have to worry about sitting behind a tall guy in a tall hat.  The legroom is good and the seats are comfortable (my ass didn't even get numb during any of the  Lord of the Rings  films).  The armrests all have cupholders.  Most importantly, though, movies there just look and sound awesome.  The video is crisp, and the audio through the digital surround-sound is outstanding.  That's probably the biggest difference between movies there and anywhere else.  If you should happen to see a movie at Showcase, and then again someplace else, the difference in sound quality is astounding.  The sound is perfect at Showcase; at the other place it will sound like you're listening to someone watching a movie in the next room.  So that's why I pay the extra money to see movies at Showcase.  I'm a bit of a movie snob in that regard, and I'm mostly okay with that.  I have nothing against seeing movies at other theaters, and if I'm with a group of people who want to go somewhere else, that's fine.  If I'm choosing, though, I'm almost always going to Showcase.  Anyway, Brandi and I went up there last night to see  50 First Dates .  We had been talking about it for a couple of weekends in a row, and finally decided to go do it.  We both really like Adam Sandler, and I must also admit a certain fondness for Drew Barrymore, who is a fine actress as well as being totally adorable.  Beyond all of that, Brandi had heard that the movie was pretty good, so we decided it was one we shouldn't miss.  It turned out to be a pretty good movie.  The premise was a little goofy--like Dana Carvey's  Clean Slate , except it focused on the people around the person with the memory loss as well as the person herself.  I feel like the premise is a little contrived and goofy, but I suppose that's mainly because I don't know if it can really happen or not.  Basically, a car accident and the resulting head trauma causes Drew Barrymore's character to lose her short-term memory each night in her sleep, so she wakes up each day thinking it's her father's birthday, and her family acts this out for her each day.  Anyway, the premise aside, the movie was well done.  It had a good cast, although it seemed just a little bit like a reunion of  The Wedding Singer --along with Sandler and Barrymore, it also featured Allen Covert as "Ten-Second Tom" (incidentally, I think Covert may be Sandler's Siamese twin, as he was also in  Anger Management ...actually, as I look at his credits on  urlLink IMDb , I see that he's been in a bunch more Sandler movies).  The movie also featured Sean Astin (about as far from Sam Gamgee as he can get), Rob Schneider (another common Sandler sidekick) and Dan Aykroyd.   50 First Dates  also shares a couple of songs in common with  The Wedding Singer .  That's not a bad thing, though, as  The Wedding Singer  had a killer soundtrack.  In this movie, all the songs are pretty familiar, except they're all being covered by new artists (except the recurring Beach Boys song that plays throughout the film, which, interestingly, isn't on the soundtrack).  I like that.  The songs are fresh that way, and I think the ones they chose all fit the story and the scenes pretty well.  As I said, the movie was pretty good.  Sandler meets Barrymore and befriends her, only to be totally confused when she doesn't remember him the next day.  He learns of her condition, and has to convince her to like him each day.  It's a good setup for some pretty funny stuff.  The movie does get a little sappy from time to time, but it's okay.  It fits.  The comedy more than makes up for it.  I'd say if you like Adam Sandler, you should definitely check this out.  Even if you don't like Adam Sandler, you shouldn't automatically rule this one out.  This one isn't quite as goofy as some of his earlier offerings, but it still manages to be funny.

      Another weekend in Bowling Green.  This is something of a rare treat for me, to spend two weekends in a row in BG.  I usually drive to Stow to spend the weekend with Brandi.  Actually, that was the plan for this weekend when the week started, but eventually she decided to come to BG instead.  I don't mind driving to Stow at all, but I tend to think that the weekends we spend in Bowling Green are just a little bit better.  We don't really know anyone in or around Stow, and we're not all that familiar with the area.  In BG, we both have friends, familiar hangouts, etc.  It's a lot of fun for us to be there.  Brandi lived in BG for the better part of four years while she went to school there, and I've lived in town for three years in addition to the three years I spent there in school, and in that time we've both had plenty of time to get attached to it.  In some ways, this weekend was a mirror of last weekend.  We had dinner Friday evening at Easystreet Cafe, which is a favorite of ours (and pretty much of everyone who has ever eaten there, as far as I can tell), and then met up with some friends to have a few drinks.  On Saturday afternoon there was a BG basketball game, and Brandi and I had dinner that night at Cucina di Betto.  All of these are things we did also last weekend.  Of course, this weekend I did end up going to the basketball game by myself because Brandi wanted to do some other things.  An added bonus for this weekend was that it was really nice out.  I hesitate to say that it was the first weekend of real spring, because I know this time of year is fickle and we'll probably have a couple more cold snaps and/or snowstorms before winter is gone for good, but it felt that way nonetheless.  The weather, I think, is why Brandi decided against coming to the basketball game--she wanted to take the opportunity to go for a run while the weather was nice.  I took advantage in my own way, and walked to the game.  The weekend wasn't exactly the same as the last one, though.  This weekend, after dinner on Saturday night, we decided to go out again.  We met up with our friends Cricket and Adam, which was a good time.  We didn't close down the bars, though.  Brandi and I went home and had another drink apiece while watching TV, and then went to bed.  On Sunday we slept in until 1:00, which was awesome.  We had a lazy day for a while, then finally decided to take advantage of yet another day's nice weather and go for a walk around campus and downtown.  It was a great day for a walk.  We went up onto campus, and I was telling her about some upcoming construction projects that are being planned.  We went into the campus bookstore and browsed for a bit.  From there we walked downtown, where we went into a couple of shops and also ended up having dinner (at Jed's, a local sports bar chain, which is fairly decent).  We stopped at Dairy Queen to get ice cream cones for the walk home.  A little later on, we went to see  50 First Dates , the new Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore movie.  I may or may not write a review of it later, but it was pretty good.  At any rate, it was on the way to the movie theater that Brandi first brought up the subject of moving back to BG in August instead of me moving to Stow in May.  We talked about it most of the way to the theater, and some more when we got back to my apartment, and by the end of the night it was decided.  My plans of moving to Stow are shelved, and Brandi will be coming back to BG when her current lease expires.  I know this was a difficult decision for Brandi, and she's still struggling with it a little bit.  Like me, she's really attached to Bowling Green, but she'll be leaving a job she likes in her chosen field for an uncertain future.  Nonetheless, I think this will make both of us happier in the long run.  We'll be in a place that we're familiar with, where we have friends, and that we both love being in.  Everything else can come in its turn.

      As I mentioned yesterday, I won't be at work on Thursday or Friday of this week, as I'll be in Cleveland for the MAC Men's Basketball Tournament.  As such, I likely won't have access to the Internet, and therefore this will be the last update to my blog until Monday.  Hopefully my Constant Readers (both of you) won't suffer from too many withdrawal symptoms in that time.  Look on the bright side:  when I do come back on Monday, I'll have four days worth of experiences to share with you.  To hold you over until then, I've got a handful of items to tell you about.  * Since I won't be working the rest of the week, today is like Friday for me.  Therefore, I decided it was entirely appropriate to assume my lunch routine for Friday.  So I went to Wendy's and got the Classic Single combo, with mustard, pickle, and onion.  Damn, that's a good sandwich.  * Next to Wendy's, a car wash had a message on their marquee wishing good luck to the "Lady Dogs."  I don't know offhand which high school that's for, but I'd be willing to bet nonetheless that some members of the student body think of their girls' sports teams as the "Bitches."  * Working with an Excel spreadsheet for a project here at work was a little frustrating yesterday.  I was trying to find a formula that would return the minimum value in a range of cells, but I wanted to exclude values of zero.  After a lot of searching (and some non-helpful assistance from my engineering department) I finally found a formula that worked.  However, you couldn't just type in the formula and hit Enter.  Oh no, for this particular formula, you had to type it in and then hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter.  I can't fathom why that is.  Someone at Microsoft had to think that was a good idea.  And you wonder why Windows is so unstable.  Obviously Microsoft engineers have lost all grip on reality.  * There's been a lot of talk lately that the NHL players will be going on strike after this season, and that the league may not have a season next year and possibly beyond.  My only question is:  will anyone notice?  I'm a pretty big sports fan, but I don't know  anyone  who's into professional hockey.  * Ah yes, more complaining about "the wife" from a certain oh-so-pleasant co-worker.  If someone can please explain why he chooses to tell me about his problems, I'd love to hear it.  If I've ever given any indication of interest, it was by accident.  * Speaking of work, I've actually been kept fairly busy here lately.  This is a good thing.  I like being here so much better when I have something productive to do.  * I've gotten no e-mail today, not even spam.  This makes me feel almost as though I've ceased to exist.

       urlLink Falcons Survive to Face Flashes   urlLink BG's Netter Fights   The Falcons live to fight another day.  There have been very few pretty games so far this season (probably none), and it's not hard to find fault with this season's hoop team.  One thing you cannot say about them, though, is that they lay down and die.  This team fights.  They don't always play well, but they do play hard, and I still find them fun to watch.  I love Falcon hoops.  That being the case, I'm taking Thursday and Friday off work this week, and I'm following the hoops team to Cleveland for the MAC Tournament.  I went to the tournament two years ago, and it was an awesome time.  Of course, BG had a hell of a team that year, led by seniors Len Matela, Brent Klassen, Keith McLeod, and Brandon Pardon.  They made it to the championship game and ended up losing to Kent State, who went on to charge into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament that year.  I don't expect similar results this year.  If it happens, I'll be pleasantly surprised, and I'll be there every step of the way.  Right now, though, I just don't know if our guys have what it takes to put together a run.  We play hard, but we don't always play smart.  There are too many fouls, too many turnovers, too many defensive lapses, too many wasted offensive possessions.  I've said it before:  I think we have the talent to win this thing, but I haven't seen enough to make me believe that we will.  Also, the deck is stacked against us at this point.  We came into the tournament as the #7 seed.  That was high enough for us to host a first-round game against a lower seed, but it's all uphill from here.  Our next game, the first at the Gund, is at noon on Thursday against 2-seed Kent State.  If we should win that game (which is possible--Kent beat us twice during the regular season, but we played them close both times, and they've been struggling lately) we would play next at 8:30 on Friday vs. the 3-seed Miami Redhawks (if the seeds hold).  If we should happen to get to the championship game, it would likely be against 1-seed Western Michigan.  It certainly won't be easy going for the Falcons.  I'll be there cheering them on every step of the way, though.  I would love to see our guys make a run at the tournament championship.  Even with the obstacles we face, it's certainly not out of the question.  I do think we've got good talent, and I don't think anyone in the conference is unbeatable.  It'll be tough, but it can be done.  And oh, how sweet it would be if we won the whole thing.  Whatever happens from this point on, my visits to Anderson Arena are over until next year.  That makes me sad, but not as much this year as it usually does.  Very rarely this year did "The House That Roars" live up to its name, and that's what makes it fun--when it gets loud and crazy in there.  The fans (particularly the students) just never showed up this season, and that's too bad.  We'll just have to hope for better energy next year.  The crowd at last night's game was particularly weak, as BGSU students are currently on spring break.  The announced crowd was just over 1,600, which isn't very good for a tournament game.  Still, there's not much that can be done without the students on campus.  I just hope the crowds at Gund Arena will be good.

      A few notes about the weekend that was, and then some.  I'm disappointed to note that my high school alma mater, the Troy Trojans basketball team lost in the state tournament yesterday, ending their season.  I think their final record was 21-2.  They lost on a neutral court by one point to a team they beat by 20 points on THEIR court during the regular season.  I thought this team had a chance to go far into the tournament, and maybe even win the whole thing.  It kills me that we lost to someone in our own conference.  I never got to see them play this year, and I wish I would have.  Senior center Matt Terwilliger is taking his considerable skills to Columbus to play hoops for Ohio State next season.  Junior guards Michael Hall and Shane Carter are back for the Trojans next season.  On a brighter note, the Troy High School bowling team competed in the state tournament this weekend.  They didn't win, but came in second.  For a team in its first year of existence, that's an incredible performance.  Having participated in Troy's youth bowling program myself when I was younger, I can speak to the quality of the program.  Hopefully this team can keep up their success for years to come.  The Bowling Green Falcons get March Madness started in earnest this evening, in the first round of the MAC Tournament.  We're back at Anderson, against the Ohio Bobcats.  The Falcons are coming into this one on a bit of a skid, having lost three in a row.  I'm hoping they can buck the trend tonight and beat the Bobcats, who happen to be not very good.  We've already beaten them at our place once this year.  If we can get to the Gund, anything can happen.  I say that, but I'm not quite sure I believe it.  BG has some talent on the roster, but they just haven't been able to put it together this year, and I have to question why I would expect that to change at this late date.  Trust me, I bleed for the Falcon hoopsters maybe more than any other sports team I follow, and I'm not counting them out until the buzzer sounds on our last game, but I'm not exactly expecting much of a tournament run.  I would love to be pleasantly surprised, though.  I feel pretty good about our chances of beating Ohio and moving on to Cleveland, but beyond that, I just don't know.  Finally, let me just mention briefly one of my biggest pet peeves about my job.  I hate it when someone, generally from my engineering department, asks me to call a company because they need information about a product.  This drives me absolutely crazy, and has been known to ruin entire mornings (not that mornings are generally that great anyway, since I'm most definitely not a morning person).  I'm not an engineer, and it usually turns out that I don't have enough information to get the information they need.  Inevitably, whoever I talk to at said company will ask me questions that I don't have answers for, and then I feel like a moron because I have to tell them I'll call back.  Everyone who works here in the office has a phone on their desk.  I do not have the slightest clue why these people don't call the companies themselves when they need information.  It would make everyone's lives a lot easier.

      What a weekend.  Before I could leave Stow for Toledo this morning, I had to clean about 6" of snow off my car.  This, after I've been talking and thinking about spring for at least a week or so.  A return to winter weather certainly wasn't unexpected, but it wasn't exactly welcome either.  I would have been just fine if we had seen our last snowfall of the year.  That capped off what was, for me, a rather strange weekend.  A good one, no doubt (aren't they all?), but strange nonetheless.  I drove to Brandi's place in Stow immediately after work on Friday evening.  I got there right around 7:00, as per usual, and Brandi and I decided to go have dinner at Olive Garden.  It's probably our favorite place to eat, and we've been talking about going there for several weekends without actually making it, so that's where we went.  We had to wait for about an hour, so we sat at the bar and had a couple glasses of wine and an appetizer (stuffed mushrooms).  This always makes the wait more tolerable.  Eventually we got our table and had a nice dinner.  At the end of dinner is when the weirdness first started, although I didn't recognize it right away.  When I tried at first to pay for our meal, the waitress came back and said my credit card had been declined.  I had trouble with this a couple of weeks ago as well, so I didn't think too much of it.  The card gets a fair amount of use, and in my experience card readers will have trouble reading certain cards after they get used a lot.  At any rate, it wasn't a huge deal, I just paid with my debit card instead.  The next morning (late in the morning--I  love  sleeping in) I was awakened to the sound of my cell phone buzzing, indicating that I had a voice mail.  When I finally rolled out of bed and checked my messages, I had an automated message from my credit card company's fraud prevention department, asking me to contact them.  Needless to say, this piqued my curiosity, so I called them.  What it boils down to is that my account was "compromised," and someone other than myself tried to use my account number to charge more than $700 worth of merchandise.  I'm not going to be responsible for those charges, but that particular account number was shut down.  That's not a particularly huge deal, especially given the alternative, but it wasn't particularly convenient, as Brandi and I were planning to go to Cleveland for the day and I wasn't carrying any other credit cards (except my debit card) at the time.  Anyway, full steam ahead.  Brandi and I decided to go to Cleveland anyway.  Actually, she was more upset about the credit card thing than I was.  Yeah, it sucks, but it's just one of those things that happens that you have to get through.  Due to the diligence of my credit card company (and I have no idea how they discovered this, but I'm exceptionally glad they did), it's not going to cost me anything other than a few days' inconvenience while I wait for my new card.  I was counting on it a little bit for our trip to Cleveland, but not so much that its loss prevented anything.  The real problem would be in the event of some sort of unexpected situation (car trouble, etc.), in which case we would have to come up with some sort of unexpected solution.  That didn't happen, though.  We went to Cleveland as scheduled.  We were thinking about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but instead we went to Tower City, which is a pretty big shopping center/entertainment complex located downtown.  That was pretty cool.  We walked around for a while and then saw  Starsky and Hutch .  After that we walked over to Gund Arena to get tickets for that night's Cavs game against the Milwaukee Bucks.  Here our plans hit a bit of a snag.  I had checked online on Friday and there were plenty of tickets left for the game, so I felt secure in our chances of being able to get a pair at the door.  However, by the time we got there, they had only singles left--they didn't have two seats together.  The game had become the event around which we had pretty much centered our entire day, so neither of us was particularly keen to leave Cleveland without going.  Therefore our only option was to buy tickets from scalpers, and I wasn't carrying much cash (I never do).  There was a group of scalpers directly across the street from the Gund, so we went over there to get an idea of how much we were going to have to spend.  That was not an experience I'm looking to repeat again anytime soon.  There were five or six guys, all talking at once, shoving tickets in my face.  I heard some numbers, and Brandi and I retreated back inside the Gund where I withdrew $100 from an ATM.  We then walked about a block away from the arena, where we found a single scalper standing all by himself, and gave him $100 for a pair of tickets that had a face value of $20 each.   urlLink The game  was an awesome time, though.  The Cavs came out of the gate on fire, and held on to beat a pretty good Milwaukee team.  Lebron had a good game and some spectacular dunks--he's worth the price of admission himself--and Carlos Boozer (a favorite of mine from his days at Duke) and Zydrunas Ilgauskas also had nice games and are fun to watch.  The whole team is fun to watch.  I didn't care about the NBA at all before this year, and I'm not a die-hard fan by any means, but it's definitely a good time.  At the game, we sat next to and met a nice man named Jack.  He chatted with us throughout about the game and the players.  Toward the end of the game he told us he's trying to get back together with his wife, and asked us to pray for him.  Praying is not something I do, but Jack, I'm thinking about you, and I hope it works out for the best, one way or another.  After the game we went to a restaurant downtown called Fat Fish Blue.  This was our third time there together.  They've usually got some good live music, and neither of us had really eaten much all day, so we were pretty hungry.  We sat by the window, and noticed three police cars line up out front while we were eating.  Our waiter told us that the staff had to break up a fight, and that's why the police showed up--some guy shoved another guy's wife, and then the two guys engaged in some fisticuffs.  We were in a different section, so we didn't see the fight, but we got to see the cops outside.  They took someone away with them, too.  Brandi wanted to use the restroom before we left the restaurant, so I accompanied her to that area and waited for her.  While she was in there, I was approached by a young man who assured me he wasn't going to ask me for money, and who then proceeded to ask me for money.  When you're in the city, being asked for money is just part of the experience--it's happened to me in Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, and Chicago--and something you get used to.  This is the first time I've been approached inside, though, so I was taken a little by surprise.  From there, our day in Cleveland was at an end, so we headed back to my car.  To get there, we ended up on a street/ramp clearly marked "NO PEDESTRIANS," so we ran the whole way.  I'm not sure why that made it better, but it was fun.  Other highlights from the day in Cleveland:  Brandi running after a flock of fat birds, trying to see if they could/would fly; Brandi walking quickly after another fat bird to see if it would let her pet it (it wouldn't, but it also didn't fly away...it just kept walking really fast); Brandi trying to get birds to eat popcorn from her hand.  I'm beginning to get the idea that Brandi has the same weird fascination with birds that I have.  To compensate for our busy Saturday, we made Sunday as low-key as possible.  We slept in, ate leftovers from Olive Garden, played  The Sims , napped, had dinner at BW3, and watched movies ( Wayne's World ,  Goldmember , and  Shakespeare in Love ).  All this, and the NCAA Tournament hasn't even started yet.

      Okay, it's not a mousetrap; it's an alarm clock.  I have a problem with oversleeping.  I think this makes me uniquely qualified to build an alarm clock, because I know what would work to help me wake up at a reasonable time.  The alarm clock I have now is far from perfect, but there's some stuff about it that I like.  One good thing about it is that it was free.  I won it as a door prize at a New Year's party I attended to ring in 1994, which makes it over ten years old.  The alarm sound is nice and loud, which is good.  Actually, it's so loud that it's been known to scare roommates and various sleeping companions over the years (I, on the other hand, have been known to let it go off for minutes at a time before becoming aware of it).  It has two alarm settings, meaning you can set it to go off at two different times if you're so inclined.  One thing has always bothered me about alarm clocks.  Let's say you have your alarm set for 8:00, but for some reason you need to get up the next day at 7:50.  On most alarm clocks, you can't just set it back ten minutes; you have to move it ahead eleven hours and fifty minutes.  That's a little tedious.  I don't think it would be too much to ask for an alarm clock to have the ability to go forwards and backwards.  Four buttons:  H+, H-, M+, M-.  Is that too difficult?  Also, I don't want to have to hold down an "Alarm" button to see and adjust the alarm time.  Too often it becomes a test of manual dexterity, trying to hold down that button while pushing the others to set the time.  There should just be a switch to flip over to "Alarm."  My current alarm clock isn't too far from that.  You do flip a switch for the alarm setting mode.  It has three setting buttons:  fast forward, forward, and reverse.  Just minutes, no hours.  If the alarm is set for 6:39 (my usual setting) and it needs to be set for 8:00, I have to hold down "forward" (or "fast forward") until it advances those 81 minutes.  This setup would be acceptable as well as my other suggestion, but there also needs to be a fast reverse button.  Now let's talk about the snooze button.  I have a love/hate relationship with the snooze button.  On one hand, it's heaven to be able to slap at the clock and then just roll over for a few more minutes.  However, I have a tendency to use it too many times per morning, which is generally why I get out of bed later than I intend.  The snooze function on my clock is only for seven minutes, which is excruciatingly short.  A perfect alarm clock, I think, would allow you to set your own custom snooze timer.  I'd set mine for about half an hour, and hopefully only hit it once per day.  The best thing for a perfect alarm clock would be if it came equipped with little legs so it could get up and run around when it goes off, along with screaming its head off.  If I had to get up and chase it down each morning, I think that would help a lot.

      The NCAA Basketball Tournament kicks off today.  It's one of the biggest sports days of the year, and I, like so many other people, am stuck at my desk at work.  This is a travesty of justice.  I should be on a couch somewhere, in front of a television (or two).  In honor of the tournament, here's an installment of randomness, March Madess style:  * I seriously thought about stopping at Circuit City on my lunch break and buying one of those little handheld televisions, which I could keep in my desk drawer here at work (next to the cookies).  That would enable me to sneak it out from time to time and keep tabs on the games.  Ultimately I decided against it, mainly because I couldn't think of a way to explain a power cord trailing into my desk drawer.  * I used to work at the Panasonic plant in my hometown of Troy, Ohio.  This would be a good time to have that job again.  They manufacture television screens, and they had televisions in every break room, plus a huge one in the lunchroom.  These televisions were constantly tuned to CBS, which happens to be the network broadcasting the tourney games.  It would be nice just to be able to check in from time to time and see what's happening.  * Since there are no televisions here and I opted not to buy one for myself,  and  I'm not allowed to have a radio, I have another Internet Explorer window open to  urlLink ESPN.com's college basketball scoreboard , which I have set to refresh itself every sixty seconds.  That way I can click over every few minutes and at least get score updates.  Apparently a lot of people are doing this--ESPN.com's servers are running  very  slow.  Our lovely shared dial-up Internet connection doesn't help matters, either.  * As much as I complain about our slow-ass Internet connection, I should note that it's not the fault of anyone here.  The powers-that-be want to get a broadband connection, but there aren't any available yet in our area.  It sounds like we're ready to make the switch as soon as we can.  * Oooh, this is awesome.  I just switched from ESPN.com to  urlLink CBS Sportsline's scoreboard , and it loaded much faster.  Also, the scores are updated automatically, so the page doesn't have to refresh.  I like this very much.  I'd rather have a TV, or at least a radio, but this is at least a decent alternative.  * My adopted team for the NCAA Tournament is the Western Michigan Broncos, the 11 seed in the Phoenix region.  They're carrying the banner for the Mid-American Conference, as the winner of the MAC Tournament and the only conference representative left in the postseason.  Conference members Toledo and Kent State both were eliminated in the first round of the NIT.  For what it's worth, I was hoping Toledo would lose, and I would not have thrown my lot in with them had they won their way into the NCAAs.  Conference unity is all well and good (I was nearly ecstatic when Kent State advanced to the Elite Eight two years ago), but I hate the UT Rockets with all my heart.  * I'm thinking my BGSU season review will be coming early next week.  The Falcons' season has been over for a full week as of today, and there aren't too many Falcon fans talking about it anymore.  I'm almost ready to toss out my two cents, and then start looking ahead to next year.  Moving on from college basketball....  * I held the door for a State Highway Patrol officer on her way into Subway today.  I'm hoping that gives me a little bit of good State Patrol karma at some point in the future when I might find myself in need of some.  * Speaking of the State Patrol...I drove over to Stow yesterday after work to spend the evening with Brandi, and there were a ton of cops on the turnpike.  The trip spans 128 turnpike miles, and I saw at least seven cops.  That's about six more than I usually see on that particular drive.  Apparently they were taking this St. Patrick's Day thing pretty seriously.  * Brandi and I had a low-key evening together.  We went out to dinner at a local restaurant called  urlLink Mike's Place , which we both really like.  Other than that, we just hung out together.  Our original plans called for us to go out and have a drink or two for St. Patrick's Day, but it didn't happen.  We did stop into BW3, intending to eat there and then commence drinking, but it was extremely crowded (a bar in a college town on St. Patrick's Day?  Go figure.) so we left to eat elsewhere, and never made it back.  Brandi's had a bit of a long week so far, with her car accident and all, and she really didn't feel like going out.  That was fine--we had a good time anyway, and we'll probably go out some this weekend.  Tonight I'm looking forward to an evening spent mainly on the couch, in front of televised basketball games.  I love this time of year.

      I went to McDonald's for lunch today.  For me, the main purpose of a lunch break is just to get away from my desk and the office for a while.  The meal is secondary.  I like to have that time in the middle of the day where I can forget this place exists, and just relax for a while.  Unfortunately, it rarely works out quite like that.  I go into McDonald's, I place my order, and I get my food.  I go from the counter to the condiment stand so I can get napkins, a straw, and my drink.  This area, however, is overrun by three little kids who seem to be there for approximately the same purpose, with no adult supervision.  One problem with this is that they're only about three feet tall, if that, and the condiment stand just isn't built to be effectively utilized by people that low to the ground.  Therefore, the going is quite slow, and it's apparent that none of them are leaving until they're all ready to go.  Secondly...well, they're kids, and they have no clue what's happening anywhere more than approximately four inches from their own bodies.  Also, they're crazy.  While one of them is struggling slowly in front of the drink machine, the other two are running and flailing around, trying to knock trays from the hands of other innocent customers.  Eventually I make my way through the obstacle course and get everything I need, then go sit down to eat and read.  About three minutes after I do this, a small child starts shrieking.  Throughout the course of my lunch, this child continues to shriek.  Occasionally other children chime in.  It makes the lunchtime experience about as irritating, unrelaxing, and unenjoyable as possible.  I live in Bowling Green and work in Toledo.  Both cities have smoking bans which outlaw smoking in restaurants unless those restaurants have smoking sections that are actually sealed off from the non-smoking sections, with separate ventilation systems.  It makes the dining experience a lot more pleasant for those of us who don't smoke.  You can probably see where I'm going with this.  Is it so outlandish to wish for a similar system for children?  There should be a separate area (soundproof) in a restaurant for people with kids, so that people who wish to have a quiet, relaxing meal can do so.  The McDonald's I was at has something like this, with an indoor play area with tables to eat at.  Not everyone with kids uses it, though.  Look, I know this was McDonald's, which is sort of a kid-oriented place, and I should just suck it up and take it.  It's like that everywhere, though, from other fast-food places up to fairly nice restaurants.  It would just be nice to occasionally be able to go out and enjoy a meal without having to put up with someone's brat making an ass of themselves.  I know it's never going to happen.  Trust me, though, this is a lot less crazy than my  real  suggestion, which is for parents (or anyone responsible for children) to exact some discipline and require said children to behave like human beings.

      Enough already with winter!  It's time for crazy weather here in Ohio, and Mother Nature is delivering.  Temperatures have generally been pretty mild lately, and we're paying for it today.  It's been snowing all day.  We're expected to have 4-6" by the time it's all said and done, and I'd say we're well on our way to that.  Luckily, the road crews are doing an uncharacteristically good job of keeping the roads clear.  I was out and about on my lunch break with no problems or even delays whatsoever.  Of course, that's here in Toledo.  Brandi, who's in Stow, called this morning to tell me she was involved in a weather-related car accident.  She's not hurt--just regular post-collision soreness--but a little shaken up, which is understandable.  It was just a fender-bender, for the most part, but it does sound like her car was knocked out of alignment, if nothing else.  Fortunately, her parents have stepped in and are getting her another car.  It sucks that it had to happen this way, but her having a newer car is a good thing.  I'm just hoping that this is our last snowstorm of the season.  It should be, seeing as how spring begins for real on Saturday.  And it's not all bad--there are a couple of cardinals hanging out in the tree right outside my office window, and they look awesome against the snowy background.  These are the sort of photographs I would take if I had a really good digital camera.  The colors are just phenomenal.  And the weather being crazy this time of year in Ohio (most of the time, really), it's supposed to get back to being mild again soon.  Whatever snow we get today will likely be gone by this weekend.  Along with crazy weather in Ohio, this is also the time of year for the NCAA basketball tournament.  This is one of my favorite times of the year, and it's maybe the best time of the year for even casual sports fans.  There's just something captivating about the tournament, especially the opening rounds.  Smaller schools are getting a rare chance to show their stuff against the "big boys" on a neutral floor, and the "survive and advance" attitude provides an amazing, emotional atmosphere.  It's great to watch--I know I've always liked watching the tournament, even back before I was as big of a basketball fan as I am now.  Brandi and I watched the selection special on Sunday evening and filled out brackets, and it was a lot of fun.  Personally, I think the first round of the tournament, which is always played on a Thursday and Friday, should be national holidays so everyone could take the day off work and watch the games.  At the very least, there should be a television in a break room or conference room or something so workers could check in periodically and see how the games are going.  Right now I can't even have a radio at my desk, so I'll be checking scores on ESPN.com every couple of minutes.  Tournament action actually starts tonight, with the opening round play-in game between Lehigh and Florida A&M.  The winner gets to face top overall seed Kentucky.  They've had this play-in game for a couple of years now, and it's always played in Dayton.  I'd love to eventually be able to go to one of these games, since it's not very far.  This year, though, I'll be watching on ESPN.  On his radio show today, Tony Kornheiser had George Mason head basketball coach Jim Larranaga on to preview the tournament and talk about his own picks.  I found Coach Larranaga to be a good radio personality and quite entertaining.  This is at least mildly noteworthy to me because he was the head basketball coach at Bowling Green before moving on to George Mason.  My first year attending BGSU was the first year for Coach Larranaga's successor (Dan Dakich), so I don't know that much about him.  You'll notice, of course, that I've said little to this point about the end of BG's basketball season.  Rest assured, there will be a season review sometime in the coming days.  Right now I'm taking a couple of days to detach myself, to think about the season and talk with other BG fans.  It was a rough season, and I think it bears some thought before I write about it.  It's coming, though, and it'll be extensive.  For now, though, let winter end and March Madness begin!

      Let's just say that if I could have mapped out the perfect day to come back from a long weekend, it would have gone almost nothing like today has gone so far.  I'm feeling a bit irritated.  Let me start by saying that I had every intention of my first blog after my hiatus being just a basic rundown of the weekend.  I may get to that at some point today, or I may not.  I was actually in the process of writing that blog, and was indeed about halfway finished with it when I stupidly decided to try to save a draft of it.  See, it was getting close to lunchtime and I didn't know if I'd be able to write anymore, so I tried to set it up so I could close the window and come back to it later.  Silly me.  Our lovely dial-up connection (shared among eight of us here in the office) chose a moment in that general time span to have a little hiccup, and I was left with "This page cannot be displayed."  My entry was lost, and I was too busy trying to keep myself from banging on everything in sight with a hammer to even bother trying to re-create it.  I still am, as a matter of fact.  It may never happen.  In case it doesn't, let me just say that I had a great weekend, except for the Falcons losing in the MAC Basketball Tournament.  Anyway, today I'm back at work after a long weekend, having taken last Thursday and Friday as vacation days so I could follow the Falcons to said tournament.  I've got a lot of stuff to get through today, which is understandable.  I'm filling two positions here, so it would be absurd for me to expect two days off without returning to a large mound of stuff on my desk to work through, even given how un-busy we've been lately.  I don't mind having all this stuff to go through.  In fact, I like it.  I like being busy.  I don't think I'll ever go so far as to say I like my job here, but I like it much better when I'm being productive.  What I do mind is one of my co-workers immediately starting to badger me about one certain relatively minor thing when I've got all this other stuff to do.  I'll be working to get everything done as soon as possible, but my number one priority is getting these projects put into the system and out into the shop so the guys out there have some work to do and so we can get this stuff on its way to being shipped.  Some (well, at least one) of my fellow office workers have an overinflated view of their own importance.  Anyway, the same Internet hiccup that caused the loss of my blog entry also put a stop to pretty much all Internet activity for the remainder of the morning.  That wasn't a long enough period of time (about an hour) to be a severe problem, but it was just one more irritating thing to add to a list that was growing even then.  Then there's lunchtime.  Lunch is supposed to be a happy time, right?  A chance to get out of the office for a bit and relax, and a Monday bonus is that it's a Wendy's day.  Of course, Wendy's is having some inexplicable construction work done to its parking lot, which is small to begin with.  Now their small parking lot has several spaces closed for construction, and the rest of the spaces taken up with construction equipment.  Also, Wendy's happens to be busy.  I ended up parking at the IHOP next door.  I hate doing that, but sometimes you have to break the rules.  So I finally get into Wendy's to discover that the people in line have no idea how to form a line.  Wendy's has railings set up so that the line will wind, but every so often people will just line up out the side of it.  Well, if the line gets larger than, say, three people, this starts to unnecessarily crowd the lobby.  I always go where the line is supposed to go, which results in mass chaos, because everyone else gets confused.  Really, people, this is  getting in line .  It's one of the most basic things in our society.  Please don't continue to screw this up.  This is why people from other countries think we're dumb...it's because WE ARE!!!  Oh well.  At least I've had a better day than Julius Caesar did on March 15.

       urlLink Without Tony, what's the point of radio?   Today was the last day for the Tony Kornheiser show on ESPN Radio.  I was an extremely limited listener.  It ran from 10:00 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day.  Of those three hours, I generally heard maybe fifteen minutes--usually it was the "Old Guy Radio" segment at the beginning of the third hour as I was on my way to lunch, and the e-mail segment at the end of the show as I was on my way back to work.  Also, the show was on for several years, and I discovered it only maybe seven months ago when the CD player in my car went haywire and I was reduced to listening to the radio until I got it fixed.  The great thing about Tony's show is that it wasn't just a sports show.  He talked about a little bit of everything.  He's a smart guy, a well-rounded guy, and I learned a lot from listening to the show.  He's also funny, which makes it interesting and easy to listen to.  He talked today on his farewell show about how he loves sports, but he also realized that there are plenty of other things in the universe and you have to be open to those other things in order to be a well-rounded person, and that he tried to reflect that in the show.  That's something I feel is true for myself also.  Anyone who knows you can tell you that I love sports, to the point where, if pressed, I'd say they're my foremost interest.  There are plenty of other things I love too, though.  It always drives me crazy that so many people who are interested in sports think they have to conform to stereotypes and thus won't allow themselves to get into certain things, or act as though anything other than sports is outside their universe.  Tony appealed to the intelligent sports fan.  Yeah, he talked about sports.  He also talked about movies, music, books, pop culture (all of which I love), politics, current events (which I don't necessarily love, but I'm pretty interested), and his own day-to-day life.  There's absolutely no other show like it out there anywhere.  I'll try the new show that starts Monday (hosted by a guy named Colin Cowherd, if I'm remembering right), and I'll give it a chance.  I wouldn't be too surprised if I start firing up my CD player on my lunch hour again, though.  Beyond that, I'll still watch Tony on ESPN's Pardon the Interruption with Michael Wilbon; I'll still read his columns in the Washington  Post .  When he finally gets a new radio show (which he's said on the air that he will--he just didn't like working with ESPN Radio management), I'll hope that it's available on a local Toledo-area station (or online) at a time that's convenient to me.  If you're out on your bike tonight, do wear white.

      What a morning.  It's not even 10:00, and I'm already halfway through a can of Mountain Dew.  Also, I'm in pain.  I've been trying for quite some time to reduce my intake of carbonated beverages.  For the most part, I've succeeded fairly well.  I used to drink a ton of pop, and I've gotten it down to just several hundred pounds.  I really try to avoid starting my day with it, but today I needed something to get me going.  I was really dragging and having a hard time keeping my eyes open.  I'm not sure why that is, as I slept well last night.  I didn't get a lot of sleep, but it was no less than I usually get--probably about 5 1/2 hours, give or take a few minutes.  I'm generally immune to the effects of caffeine (I can drink a can of pop and have no problem falling asleep shortly thereafter), but it seems to be working nicely this morning.  Being in pain is a minor irritation only.  I really don't need to be able to move today.  The reason I'm sore is because yesterday was a nice day, and I decided to take advantage of it by opening up my running season.  I took up jogging two years ago, but I can only do it when the weather is at least relatively warm.  I can't handle gulping in cold air while doing something strenuous.  That being the case, I take winters off from running.  I went out yesterday for the first time this year.  I knew the layoff would mean I wouldn't be in the same shape I was when I stopped last year, so I was fully prepared for the fact that I wouldn't be able to run as far as I used to.  I was hoping for better than what I got, but it wasn't as bad as I feared.  I don't know offhand how far I ran, but if I had to guess I'd probably put it at just under a mile.  So I'm feeling it today, but that too isn't as bad as I thought it might be.  My lower back is pretty sore, and my quads are a little tight.  I think my legs, at least, will work themselves out over the course of the day, and I'm hoping a can get a little back massage from Brandi when I get to her place this evening.  When I was in junior high and high school gym class, I hated running.  Passionately.  I wasn't sure I could get into it now, even though it's voluntary.  If I had known when I first started that I'd still be doing it two years later, I would have been at least a little surprised.  It's turned into something I like pretty well, though.  I actually kind of like the feeling of being a little sore a day after exercising.  I like going being away from my apartment and outside for a while.  It gives me some time to unwind mentally and just think about different things.  When I'm at home, there are always distractions--television, books, computer, etc.  When I'm running, though, it's just me and my thoughts.  Even if I don't have anything specific on my mind, it's good to shut down for a while and just look around as I run.  I started doing it just to get myself into better shape, and that's still the goal.  Other than that, I admittedly don't get a lot of exercise.  I work a desk job, and I sit around a lot when I'm at home.  I also don't have the best diet in the world, although I'm fairly conscious of that and try to keep myself in check.  I'm not overweight by any means, but I'm also not in great shape.  I certainly wouldn't mind looking better, although that's not my main goal.  I generally run at night, mainly to avoid the sun in the summer.  It works into my schedule better that way as well.  Yesterday I ran in the early evening, about 6:15.  It was supposed to rain later in the evening, and I wanted to avoid that.  Also, I didn't know if it was going to get chilly after the sun went down, so I took advantage of the fairly warm temperatures (probably low 60s) while I had them.  While it didn't go as well as I hoped, it was nice to be out again.  You can definitely tell that spring is coming to Bowling Green.  Plenty of people were out and about, walking, running, riding bikes.  People were cooking out, playing catch, or just sitting on their porches and having a beer.  Also, the road construction on Wooster St. is getting into full swing.  Yep.  Spring is definitely here.  Woohoo!

       urlLink Hoffmania! - The Chronicle of the American Condition   I'm going to add this to my list of permanent links over on the left.  It looks to be pretty interesting.  Basically, it's a blog that takes a look at day-to-day events in politics and government.  It tries to expose the poor job being done by the Bush administration, and promotes John Kerry for the 2004 presidential election.  To be honest, I'm still not sold on John Kerry.  Regardless, I'll almost certainly be voting for him in November.  I'll vote for whoever has the best chance of defeating George W. Bush.  I find Mr. Bush to be spectacularly unintelligent, and I don't even think he's a good person.  In short, he has no business being in charge of our country.  I don't know if Mr. Kerry is the best man for the job (I just want to know more about him--admittedly, I haven't been paying a whole lot of attention yet), but in this particular race, I'm sure he's the  better  man for the job.

       urlLink Hoosier Was Unlikely Hero   Two years ago at this time, BGSU basketball was coming off a highly successful season.  They finished 24-9, losing three times to Kent State (who stormed into the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament), including once in the MAC Championship Game, and finishing the season with a loss to Butler in the NIT.  Coming off that season, the Falcons were looking to rebuild.  They were losing four senior starters to graduation--point guard Brandon Pardon, shooting guard Keith McLeod (MAC Player of the Year), power forward Brent Klassen, and center Len Matela.  Shortly after the NCAA Tournament ended, BG head coach Dan Dakich decided to leave as well.  On April 4, 2002 he accepted the head coaching job at West Virginia University.  Coach Dakich was generally well liked by BG fans, and there was a lot of disappointment that day.  No one blamed him, though.  WVU is a member of the Big East Conference, and can afford to pay its coaches a lot more than BGSU can.  Also, a bigger conference means a better chance to make the NCAA Tournament.  It was no secret that Coach Dakich was frustrated after being passed over twice for an at-large bid to the tournament despite highly successful seasons.  In any case, many BG fans resolved to keep an eye on WVU and our former coach, while we started looking forward and speculating about who would be hired to lead our Falcons.  For me, the following week was disheartening.  I certainly understood Coach Dakich's decision to leave, but I was more than disappointed.  I felt like someone close had left me.  I'll explain.  I came to BGSU as just a casual fan of college basketball.  I spent the first two years of my college career at Wright State University, where I had attended only a handful of basketball games.  They were fun, but not that big of a deal.  When I came to BG, I felt it would probably be the same way.  This was in 1997, which was also Coach Dakich's first year at BG.  The first BG basketball game I attended was actually against Wright State.  I thought it would be fun to see the guys I used to cheer for play against the guys I would now cheer for.  Hey, it was a reason to go.  Besides, BG's arena was easily accessible, and it was something to do.  For my first game in Anderson Arena, it was quite memorable.  Since I had no idea where to go, we ended up sitting in someone else's reserved seats (I went with my friend Jamie, who was my girlfriend at the time).  BG forward Dave Esterkamp and WSU center Thad Burton got into a fight.  WSU won the game, led by point guard Brandon Pardon, who would eventually transfer to BG and become one of my favorite players.  I went to several more games that season, and slowly transformed into the die-hard BG hoops fan you now see before you.  Why?  Simple:  Coach Dakich.  His teams play hard and are easy to cheer for.  He's extremely animated on the sidelines.  Sometimes he puts on a better show than the game, which makes it fun.  One year, during a stretch in which he felt the team needed to "turn things around," he came out before the game with his jacket on backwards.  It worked, too--we went on a pretty good winning streak.  He's not afraid to speak his mind, and it's solely due to him that I'm as BG crazy as I am.  So on April 4, when he took the job at West Virginia, I was upset.  I did understand, though, so I looked each day to see if there was any news on who our new coach would be.  Names surfaced, and it seemed like it would be only a short time before a new coach was named.  Then it happened:  I hopped online the following Friday, April 12, to ESPN.com.  The headline?  Something to the effect of "Dakich Quits at West Virginia."  I got almost no work done that morning, as I surfed the Internet for further details as they became available.  By lunchtime, it was clear that Coach Dakich was coming back to the Falcons.  Needless to say, West Virginia fans were pretty upset with his sudden about-face, but Falcon fans were very happy.  Personally, I was nearly delirious.  Fast forward to now.  The Falcons finished this year 14-17 after a loss to Kent State in the second round of the MAC Tournament.  This is the second consecutive losing season for the Falcons, who finished 13-16 the year before.  Since returning from his weeklong stint at WVU, Coach Dakich has failed to produce a winner for BG.  Take into account that BG was considered one of the top contenders to win the MAC West Division this year, and some fans are ready to turn up the heat on Coach Dakich.  Count me out.  No sir, I won't be drinking the Kool-Aid.  Every coach has a season that doesn't go according to plan, which was definitely the case for Coach Dakich and the Falcons this year.  Overly critical fans are quick to point out that we've had two losing seasons in a row.  Well, I'm not willing to count the first one against Coach Dakich.  We all knew going in that it was going to be a rebuilding year, after losing all five starters from the previous season (the four above-mentioned seniors, plus freshman guard Erik Crawford, who transferred to Northern Iowa during the offseason).  On top of that, the roster was decimated by injuries--forwards Germain Fitch and Josh Almanson and guard Jabari Mattox all suffered season-ending injuries.  If memory serves, we finished out the year with six scholarship players, one walk-on, and two imports from the football team.  Having a winning season under those conditions would have qualified Coach Dakich for National Coach of the Year honors, I think.  There's certainly no denying, though, that this season was a disappointment.  As I said, the Falcons were expected to contend for the MAC West Division.  Those expectations never materialized.  Simply stated, the team was too inconsistent.  There would be games where we looked good, and then we'd follow with games where we looked awful.  We often played poor defense.  We fouled too much.  We turned the ball over too much on offense.  We'd go through scoring droughts.  We had no consistent presence on the low post.  Looking back, I get the feeling that the preseason expectations were just too high.  Sure, we had lost only one senior from the previous year, a guard named Cory Ryan (now on Coach Dakich's staff) with more heart than talent.  Everyone else was back, and we had a good incoming freshman class.  Still...when you get everyone back from a team that goes 13-16, what does that mean?  There were just too many unknown quantities.  We were placing too many expectations on incoming freshmen and players coming back from injuries.  Jabari Mattox's injury wasn't fully healed for this year, and he ended up leaving the team partway through the season.  Germain Fitch came back to play, but re-injured his knee and lost the season to injury.  Josh Almanson did manage to rehab for this year, and he played pretty well.  The newcomers were a mixed bag.  Center Matt Lefeld played fairly well in limited minutes, but fouled too much and had some injury problems.  Guard Chris Hobson played a limited role due to asthma, but is a tenacious defender and may develop into a scorer.  Guard Austin Montgomery had some good games, but had a tendency to fold under pressure.  Forward Isaac Rosefelt barely played.  Point guard Steven Wright technically wasn't a newcomer, but didn't play last year due to incoming eligibility problems.  He has potential, but did not have a special year this year.  He turned the ball over too much, didn't defend the perimeter well enough, and didn't score the ball or dish out enough assists to keep our offense moving.  The biggest problem this year was the lack of leadership.  BG teams under Coach Dakich have  always  taken on the personalities of their seniors, and this year was no exception.  Our lone senior (after Mattox left) was center Kevin Netter, and as he went, so did the team.  He lost focus at crucial moments, was too inconsistent, and had trouble staying out of foul trouble and on the floor.  He had the potential to be the best center in the MAC, but didn't quite make it.  I'm not giving Coach Dakich a free pass on the woes of this season by any means.  At the end of the day, the head coach is responsible for all aspects of the program.  We didn't have a successful season, and he has to take responsibility for that fact.  At the same time, I don't think it's fair for anyone to say or imply that his job should be in jeopardy because of it.  It's now his job to evaluate where we are and take the steps he thinks are appropriate to help the program move forward.  If that means changing his coaching principles, recruiting strategies, or whatever, he needs to do it.  I think he's a heck of a coach, and I  know  he wants to win.  He cares about the program, the kids he coaches, the fans, and the university.  He has shown this.  I trust him to do what he needs to do to make things better.  I think he's earned that type of trust from Falcon fans.  If we have more season like this, then I'll agree that changes will need to be considered.  I just don't think that point is now.  The Falcons haven't been to the NCAA Tournament since 1968.  "Wait 'til next year" is getting old, but it's what we've got.  The eternal optimist, I think next year might be the year a lot of Falcon fans expected to have this year.  Sometime between now and November, when next season starts, I'll have a preview of the 04-05 BGSU Falcons.

      Fear not, loyal readers:  I'm working on an entry for today as we speak.  While you wait for that, though, let me take a moment to express my irritation.  I mentioned during my weekend review that I tried to get my new license plates for my car, but that I couldn't do it because I wasn't carrying the proper identification.  When I got back into town this week, I checked the Ohio BMV's website to find out when my local office was open.  Of course, it's generally open from 8:00-5:00, which are exactly the same hours that I work.  It said, however, that they were open until 6:30 on Wednesdays.  I went over there after work today, armed with all the proper identifications.  I found the office closed.  The listed hours have the office being open until 6:30 on Mondays.  Lovely.  I came home and re-checked the BMV website and found the same information.  After a bit of searching, I found another page of office listings.  This page showed the correct hours.  So they've got ostensibly the same information in two different places, one with the correct information and one with incorrect information.  Lucky me, I saw the incorrect information first and acted on it.  Unfortunately, there aren't any offices within fifteen miles of where I work.  This means I'm going to have to go back to the office in Stow on Saturday, or wait until Monday to go back to the office here in Bowling Green.  What a pain in my ass.

      I was originally planning to include a concert review as part of yesterday's weekend review.  However, I eventually concluded that it merited an entry of its own.  I was introduced to the music of Edwin McCain nine years ago, during my freshman year in college.  My roommate, Matt, had seen Edwin perform live as the opening act for Hootie and the Blowfish, and had picked up his first (major label) CD,  Honor Among Thieves .  He listened to that CD all the time, and I liked it a lot as well.  I found myself putting it on even when Matt wasn't around, and eventually I bought a copy of my own.  As much as I enjoyed the music, I didn't fully appreciate it until some time later.  One night Matt had gone to bed, and I was still awake and doing homework.  I put my headphones on and listened to the CD, and that allowed me to hear all the subtle details and nuances of the music that I had missed.  The last song on that CD is "3 a.m.", which is a fairly slow song featuring just Edwin singing and playing an acoustic guitar.  I could hear all the little growls in his voice, and it gave me chills.  That's still one of my favorite songs.  In the nine years since then, Edwin has released four more albums ( Misguided Roses ,  Messenger ,  Far From Over , and  The Austin Sessions ) and re-released his very first CD ( Solitude ), which was originally available only on a limited basis.  His newest CD (I've heard two different titles, and I don't know which one is right) is scheduled to be released on June 22.  Being a fan of Edwin's music has also turned me on to a whole slew of excellent bands and musicians--some of them I've seen open for Edwin, and some of them I've just heard about by talking to other "Edheads."  Probably you've never heard of any of them, but here's a list anyway--if you're looking for some good music that isn't the pop crap that's spoon-fed to everyone by the radio conglomerates, check out some of these:   urlLink Angie Aparo , the  urlLink Mike Corrado Band ,  urlLink Gibb Droll , Pete Riley (who has since joined Edwin's band), Treehouse (the band Pete used to sing for),  urlLink Jeffrey Gaines ,  urlLink Beth Hart , and  urlLink Mieka Pauley .  At any rate, Saturday was my eighth time seeing Edwin perform live.  Needless to say, I love going to his shows.  It's pretty basic, and you always know what you're going to get.  There's no fancy staging, no special effects--it's just six guys on stage, laying it on the line.  In the eight shows I've been to, there have been some less than stellar crowds, but Edwin never cheats anyone.  He puts his soul into every show.  It was a general admission show, so we got there plenty early.  I had gotten tickets that allowed us to get in a little before most people, so we got a pretty good spot just about a row back from the stage.  The opening act was a band called  urlLink Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise , and they were pretty good.  They had kind of a bluesy sound, and their lead guitarist was really good.  They played for about an hour, and there was a twenty-minute break for equipment changes before Edwin and his band came on.  They kicked off with a tune called "My Mystery" that will be on the new CD when it comes out.  In all, they played five tunes from the new album--four originals, plus a cover of Rod Stewart's "Maggie May" to end the show.  I liked the new songs a lot, which makes me even more anxious for the new album to come out.  It's nice to have a little preview.  Of course, the familiar songs were awesome as well.  I think the best concerts are those where you can tell that the band is having a great time up there, and this was definitely one of those.  Edwin said early in the show that he loved playing in this particular venue, and it showed.  When he sings, there is just so much emotion in his voice.  The guys in the band were walking around, jamming together, and it was great.  They're all excellent musicians and entertainers--they know how to put on a show.  For me, the highlight of the show was when they played the song "Sign on the Door" (from the  Messenger  album).  This is one of my favorite Edwin songs, although I didn't fully appreciate it until the first time I heard them play it live.  More than any other, I feel like this is the song in which Edwin really lets go and just belts it out with everything he's got.  It's inspiring.  Also, the lyrics are incredible.  This is one song that I wish I had written.  I can't even adequately describe what it's like to hear it performed live; you just have to experience it for yourself.  Besides the stories Edwin told, the funniest moment of the night came during the song "Darwin's Children" (from  Misguided Roses ).  The band launched into the song, and Edwin walked up to the mic and immediately began singing the second verse.  As soon as he started, he knew he had screwed up:  he got a confused look on his face and started looking around at his bandmates.  He finished out the verse and then started over.  Another cool moment came during the song "I'll Be" (from  Misguided Roses ), which is probably Edwin's most popular song.  Before the last chorus, he removed his earplugs and stepped to the side of the microphone, singing without amplification so he could hear the crowd sing along with him, which we did with gusto.  It was awesome.  I can only imagine how it feels to be up there, listening to an entire crowd of people sing along to words you've written.  I've seen him do this before, but it gives me chills every time.  Good stuff.  Perhaps the best part of the whole evening was that Brandi really enjoyed the show as well.  That means we'll be going to see him again (and again and again).   SET LIST   1. My Mystery (new) 2. Jesters, Dreamers, and Thieves ( Honor Among Thieves ) 3. Save the Rain (new) 4.

      The first day of spring brought with it a pretty nice weekend in the Toledo area.  That's what I hear, anyway.  I was in Stow and Cleveland, and on the first day of spring, it snowed.  A lot.  It always snows there.  I don't know how people can stand to live there.  It's kind of a fun area, but this winter has just sucked.  It keeps snowing and snowing and snowing, throwing in a nice day here and there for a tease.  Then the snow comes back.  It's relentless, and I think living there would eventually just suck the soul right out of your body.  Actually, you'd probably just get used to it.  Snow aside, it was a good weekend.  A long weekend would have been nice, so I could have seen more of the NCAA Tournament, but I really can't complain too much.  The plan for Friday called for me to drive over to Brandi's immediately after work.  That was altered a little bit, as Brandi drove to her parents' house in Clyde to get her new car.  Since Clyde is right between Toledo and Stow, I stopped there on my way.  We hung out for a while and went out to dinner that night with her parents.  I can't remember the name of the place where we ate, but it was a Mexican place in Bellevue, and the food was great.  Brandi's stepmom gave me a book, which will always put me in a good mood.  The book was  Mystic River , which I started on Saturday.  If I like it, I'll probably see the movie when it comes out on DVD.  We drove from there to Brandi's place in Stow.  We had to drive separately, but it's not a bad drive.  Of course, I like to drive anyway, but I don't think Brandi is especially fond of it, particularly since she was in an accident just last week.  At any rate, when we got to Stow, Brandi took me for a ride in her new car.  It's a 99 Sunfire, and it's pretty cool.  We went to the grocery store to pick up a few things, including a USA Today featuring an article about the  urlLink upcoming 3rd Harry Potter movie .  Saturday did not start in a promising fashion.  Last week I received the title of my own car, which was recently purchased outright from a lease, so I needed to go to the local BMV to try to get new plates.  After getting there and standing in line for fifteen minutes, I couldn't get them because I wasn't carrying anything with my Social Security number printed on it.  That was irritating, to say the least.  And now I'm technically driving my own car illegally, since my old tags expired on Saturday (please don't report me).  I'm not especially concerned about it, though.  I'm going to get it taken care of this week, whichever night the BMV office in Bowling Green is open past 5:00.  The day got much better after that.  Brandi and I watched some tournament basketball on TV, then headed up to Cleveland.  We had tickets to see  urlLink Edwin McCain  in concert at The Odeon in the Flats that night.  We left early, partially because we planned to eat beforehand at the BW3 we knew was near the venue, and partially because I wasn't 100% sure how to get there.  I've been there before, and Brandi and I both have a working knowledge of Cleveland, so we made it without too much trouble.  I'll get more in-depth about the show later on, but for now let's just say that it was awesome.  As we headed back to Brandi's car afterwards is when it started to snow.  As we got out of downtown Cleveland and headed south on I-77 is when it started to snow heavily.  When we got onto the turnpike heading east, we were just being dumped on.  The snow was so thick that it felt like I was constantly driving under an overpass.  Oh yeah, and I was also driving Brandi's car for essentially the first time, so it was a little nerve-racking.  We got through it, though--I just drove slowly and focused on the road, and everything was fine.  Sunday was mostly a lazy day, as Sundays generally are and should be.  Brandi went to the YMCA where she works so she could work out, while I stayed in bed until 12:30.  We watched basketball for a while after she got back, then went to the laundromat and also got her car washed.  We watched more basketball when we got home, napped, watched TV, and ate pizza.  More later on the show.

      There is currently an army of men with leafblowers just outside my office window.  Happy Monday morning, and welcome to spring.  I've got plenty of stuff to write about today, but I wanted to get to one thing right off the bat.  I was away from my blog (and indeed, the Internet in general) all weekend, and logged in this morning to find a couple of comments waiting for me.  I appreciate the comments--it lets me know I'm not just sitting here mumbling to myself.  There was one in particular, from Jimbo, that I wanted to respond to.  His comment was a response to my blog entitled " urlLink A Modest Proposal ."  His comment is as follows:   "If I remember correctly your were once a small child yourself. Oh by the way one day you will have children of your own to enjoy the others around you."   Let's take this one piece at a time.   "If I remember correctly your were once a small child yourself."   You remember correctly.  The difference, of course, is that I was never allowed to act like such a moron in public.  I think Jimbo might know that already.  Kids will be kids, of course, but at some point the parents (or whoever is in charge at any given point) need to take action and keep their kids from getting out of control.  I don't think this is too much to ask.   "Oh by the way one day you will have children of your own to enjoy the others around you."   Simply put, it's not gonna happen.  I've said for a very long time that I would never have children.  Admittedly, I wondered myself if that was true or not, and I eventually started qualifying it by saying that I didn't want children, but that I was willing to negotiate with the right person.  I think I've found the right person.  However, I also think the days of being willing to negotiate are waning, and may even be entirely gone.  I do not want to have children.  Period.  Why don't I want children?  To be blunt, I'm too selfish.  I know that having children requires a great deal of sacrifice that I'm not willing to make.  I like being able to just go and do the things I want to do, without having to worry about dragging irritating kids along, or having to find a babysitter.  I'm not doing it.  For what it's worth (probably not much), I happen to think  most  people are too selfish to have kids.  I'm just one of the rare ones willing to admit it and take steps to avoid the situation.

      Brandi is in Bowling Green to visit this weekend.  Right now she's at my apartment, taking a nap.  That would be nice.  I'm extremely tired right now.  Last night was another late one, which resulted in another bout of oversleeping this morning.  I'm really dragging today.  If Brandi is still sleeping when I get home (which is about four hours from now, so most likely she won't be), I'm going to curl up and drop off right next to her.  I was reading for a little bit last night, but for the most part my late commitment to sleep came about because I was cleaning my apartment.  It wasn't in horrible shape, but needed some straightening and a little bit of actual cleaning work.  Mostly I had dishes to wash.  Believe it or not, I don't hate doing this sort of thing; I just don't do it all that often, because I take my time doing it, and thus it takes a while.  Brandi makes fun of me for this all the time, but that's fine.  I had a roommate in the past who was the worst washer of dishes in the history of mankind.  I take a long time doing dishes, but I'm perfectly confident that anyone who comes to my place can take out a glass or a fork or something and use it without having to inspect it first for leftover bits of food from the last time it was used.  That has not been the case with some of the people I've lived with.  Besides that, I don't mind taking a long time in the cleaning process because it gets me out of my normal routine of television, video games, Internet surfing, etc.  I just kind of zone out while I'm doing it, and think about different stuff.  Don't get me wrong--I certainly don't love it (evidenced by the fact that I don't do it often), but it's not the worst thing going, either.  I was up late doing that last night, and I was getting pretty tired toward the end.  I seriously thought about leaving some of it, then getting up and doing it before work this morning.  I had an idea that it wouldn't happen, though, and I'm glad I had the foresight to be aware of that.  I have no idea how I manage to oversleep so consistently, but I did it again today.  The alarm clock is definitely going across the room for next week.  I did eventually manage to get up and make it to work, and I'm oh so glad I did.  I've had so much to do today.  Oh, wait...did I forget to turn on my "sarcasm" font?  Yeah, I've been bored out of my mind.  I've had a couple of things to do here and there, but nothing major.  On the bright side, a fifty-something co-worker did come up and tell me all his lusty thoughts about some attractive girls he saw the other day who were approximately my age.  That's always pleasant, and makes me so glad I drove half an hour to be here.  Or perhaps not.  At least the day hasn't been a total loss.  As per usual, I caught a few minutes of "The Herd" on my way to lunch today.  Colin Cowherd is no Tony Kornheiser, but he's got potential to be decent.  Yesterday he was talking about attractive older women, and today he was having people call in to do Tom Brokaw imitations.  That was pretty amusing.  Maybe he'll end up earning my listenership (I can make up words if I want to--I have a degree in English.  I'm a professional, kids...don't try this at home) after all.  Now, if only I could find a place to lie down and sleep away the remainder of the afternoon.  I definitely don't have anything better to do.

      Once again I've resorted to a can of Mountain Dew for a caffeinated jump-start to my morning.  My alarm clock and my watch failed this morning in their combined efforts to confuse me again, which means that I didn't get up on time and was once again late to work.  Back to my usual routine, that is.  I was awake enough to be able to tell the time, but beyond that I had a very hard time getting my bearings once I was out of bed.  I kept stumbling in the shower.  Despite my lateness, I resolved to take my time getting ready to leave for work.  I rushed through everything yesterday, thinking I was running late when really I wasn't, and I ended up forgetting several things.  Being late for work isn't that big of a deal--it just makes me feel like a moron.  Luckily, right now I don't have any work anyway, so it isn't as though I was missing anything.  At any rate, while shaving and brushing my teeth this morning, I happened to actually look at myself in the mirror.  This is something of a rare occurrence, as I generally don't care a whole lot about my appearance and thus don't spend much time in front of the mirror.  I use it, of course, but sparingly.  Today, though, I happened to catch a glimpse of my eyes, and I wasn't crazy about what I saw.  They were red, and generally looked tired and weak.  I know I don't get enough sleep, and this is becoming more and more evident lately.  It tends to go in cycles, really, and right now it's clear that I need to force myself into the part of the cycle where I get more sleep.  Often I find myself awake past 2:00 a.m., which then makes it difficult for me to drag myself out of bed around 7:00-ish.  I can operate with that little sleep, obviously, but it takes a toll after a while.  To that end, I'm resolving to start next week in getting myself to bed earlier.  To keep it realistic, I'll say I need to be in bed by 1:00 a.m., which will hopefully result in my ability to get out of bed by 7:00 a.m. at the latest.  Six hours of sleep per night is good for me through the week.  I can work with that.  Catching up on weekends is a very good thing.  That rule will be in force only until I get to a point where I don't feel like I'm going to die every morning.  I'm not much into rules, particularly bedtimes.  It makes me feel either very young or very old, neither of which I care for very much.  To help myself get up on time on a consistent basis...as much as I hate to do it, I think I'm going to have to put my alarm clock across the room so that I have to physically get out of bed in order to turn it off.  This is what gets me out of bed on time when I stay with Brandi.  I hate it, but nothing else seems to work.  I hate being on a consistent schedule.   Hate  it.

      Since I'm going to at least mention baseball today, I thought it appropriate to revert to my original title for an entry of quick-hitters, since it originally came from a newspaper's sports page.  * I was extremely out of it this morning.  I'm not a morning person, as I'm sure I've mentioned before, but this morning I hit new highs of confusion and befuddlement upon waking.  It was so bad that I managed to misread both my alarm clock and my watch, and hurried through my shower thinking I had overslept by quite a bit.  Instead, I had somehow managed to get up before I normally do, which allowed me to leave my apartment at 7:30 and actually arrive at work on time for a change.  * I accidentally went to McDonald's for lunch today.  I found there the same oblivious lady with the same obnoxious, shrieking children (see  urlLink this post  for more details).  I don't think I'll go to McDonald's on my lunch break anymore.  The food isn't that good there anyway.  * The book I'm currently reading on my lunch break is Pat Conroy's  Beach Music , which was recommended to me by Brandi's stepmom.  I like it so far, but I'm having a few issues.  The prose is outstanding, but the dialogue is grating.  That's something I can speak to, being a fiction writer myself, because it's one thing I excel at.  I have an ear for how people speak, and so far, Conroy's characters don't ring true.  I won't have a total feel for it until I finish the book, though, so it's possible that I'll revisit this at a later date.  *  urlLink 12 Reasons Gay Marriage will Ruin Society   * The Yankees and Devil Rays played another game in Tokyo this morning at 5:00.  This one was not televised on ESPN.  Their two-game series is now over, and both teams will return to the United States to resume spring training.  Yes, that's right.  Now that they've played two official games, they now resume their preseason.  Please, someone tell me where the logic is in any of this.  * Twice now I've caught a little bit of "The Herd" (hosted by Colin Cowherd) on ESPN Radio, the show which replaced "The Tony Kornheiser Show."  It seems okay.  I'll give it a chance for a while, but honestly, I don't know if I'll keep listening for long.  It seems so far like it's going to be just another guy talking about the same stuff that all the other media types are talking about.  * I've been reading and hearing (and paying attention) more lately about Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, and I'm liking what I see/hear.  My opinion of him has gone up, from "I'm voting against Bush" to "I'm voting for Kerry."  I even requested a bumper sticker that I may actually put on my car.  Even if I don't do that, I'll definitely display it prominently somewhere.

      My schedule is a little bit off today.  I had leftovers from my trip to Olive Garden with Brandi this weekend, so I brought that in for lunch today.  I had some other stuff I needed to take care of, so I stayed in and ate at my desk instead of going out for lunch, which I usually do.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've stayed in the office for my lunch break, and I've been here for over two years.  That wasn't the only difference.  My alarm clock was set for 4:55 this morning, and I actually got out of bed when it went off.  I moved from my bed out onto the couch in the living room so I could catch at least a little bit of the first official Major League Baseball game of the season, between the New York Yankees and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.  This game was televised live from Tokyo, Japan.  That's why it was on at 5:00 a.m.  Major League Baseball has problems.  Ten years ago, there were labor issues that shortened the season and forced the cancellation of the World Series.  A lot of fans gave up on baseball at that point.  The home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa in 1998 brought some back, but not all.  Now there are financial disparities so great that some teams are virtually eliminated from competition from the beginning of the season (for instance, the Yankees are paying $22 million this season just for third baseman Alex Rodriguez; their opponent this morning, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, are paying approximately that much for their entire roster).  Also, there's the interesting little question of whether or not some players are juicing themselves up with steroids.  With all of these issues swirling around, plus several others, it's no wonder that baseball isn't nearly as popular as it used to be.  One obvious way to cater to fans and try to win them back is to stage the opening of the season on an entirely different continent, at a time when most of the U.S. is asleep and can't even watch on television.  For any of you who didn't get the memo, that was sarcasm.  This was a terrible idea.  Baseball's Opening Day used to be a big deal.  Almost every team started play on the same day, and it was cause for celebration.  Spring was here, and baseball was back.  It was nice.  The honor of opening the baseball season with the earliest game on Opening Day always belonged to the Cincinnati Reds, as baseball's oldest professional franchise.  Opening Day is still a big deal in Cincinnati, but it no longer kicks off the season.  Now the opening game of the season is between two random teams, usually in a different country.  For a sport that is known as the "American Pastime," and for one that generally is so wrapped up in history and tradition, I cannot fathom why this practice has changed.  I know that baseball has become dependent, to a certain extent, on other countries and regions, such as Japan and Latin America.  Look at major league rosters, and they're dotted (and in some cases lined) with players from these areas.  I like the idea of opening the sport up to these areas and creating more exposure.  I just don't think this is the way to do it.  I think it alienates fans here in the U.S., who are and always will be far and away the largest fan base for a professional sport with teams located only in North America.  Baseball already alienates the fans in too many ways, and in this case the people in charge are just putting one more thing on the list.  They've been kicking around the idea of a World Cup of Baseball for quite some time.  I think that's an awesome idea, if they can get the logistics figured out.  That would be a great way to include the whole world in "our" sport.  I don't know if MLB would send maybe the champions of the World Series, or if they'd put together an all-star team of sorts, but either way I think it could be a lot of fun.  I'm a huge fan of sports, and while football and basketball are now my favorites, baseball is my first love.  I just hope someday it can get back to being the great sport it used to be.

        Lyrics from "Popular" by Nada Surf       Finally, it's official.  After several false starts and a bunch of hassle, I finally managed to get new plates for my car this weekend.  I went to the license bureau in Stow on Saturday at a time when I knew it was open, and I had the proper identification.  My car is now registered and plated, street legal.  That makes it now 100% mine--it's no longer a lease, and there are no payments owed.  I'd like to thank my parents for that, a whole lot.  So now the car is mine, and that's awesome.  To celebrate, I'll probably end up taking my car out for a brake job.  Driving around with the windows down this weekend alerted me to some fairly significant squeakage, which I need to get checked out.  I'm just glad that I could drive around with the windows down.  This was one of those rare times when a window of good weather happened to coincide with the weekend, instead of during the week when it could only be enjoyed through my office window.  This weekend was awesome in terms of weather.  Now it's cooled down again, and it's raining.  That's what Mondays are supposed to be like, though.  Save the nice stuff for Saturdays and Sundays (and Friday nights--good bar weather).  Friday night I drove over to Stow after work.  Brandi hadn't eaten anything all day, and I was pretty hungry myself, so we hurried over to BW3.  Brandi was kind enough to accede to my request that we eat somewhere that we could watch the NCAA Tournament games that were going on; or perhaps she was just so hungry that she didn't care where we ate.  Either way, we went to BW3 to eat and watch the games.  We had a couple of drinks too.  We left when the first batch of games ended, which was about 9:30 or so.  We stopped for ice cream on the way back to her place, and then watched the late basketball games when we got there.  On Saturday morning I got up and went to get my plates.  Brandi was still asleep when I got back, so I played  The Sims  and waited for her to wake up.  She slept pretty late, which is generally my domain.  We took our time getting ready for the day, but eventually we headed out to the mall in Cuyahoga Falls, near where she lives.  No specific purpose, just to walk around for a while.  We were both really hungry when we were finished there, so we went down the street to the local Olive Garden.  That was pretty awesome, as usual.  We went home after that for still more basketball.  We watched, then went for a walk to enjoy the nice evening.  We watched a movie ( A Bug's Life , which Brandi just bought on DVD) when we got home, and had popcorn.  That's always good.  On Sunday, Brandi got up early to be productive, while I remained in bed.  She went to the grocery, did laundry, and washed her car; I was still asleep when she got home.  I still managed to get up before noon, which is at least relatively early for me on a weekend.  Brandi had bought donuts while she was out, so we happily chowed down.  We went for a drive that afternoon, then stopped in at Wal-Mart to pick up a few things.  We spent the afternoon after we got back--what else?--watching basketball.  We had the living room window open, and the breeze coming through was outstanding.  Brandi made dinner for us that evening.  She made spaghetti with lots of veggies and stuff, and it was really, really good.  We spent the rest of the night watching TV/movies.  Now I'm back at work, waiting for next weekend and hoping it's as nice as this one was.

       urlLink Bowl game tough to top   urlLink Twelve Falcon Facts You Need to Know   I just got back from my lunch break not too long ago.  As has been happening fairly frequently lately, I had a harder time than usual forcing myself back into the office.  I have very little work to do this afternoon, and it's a beautiful day outside.  The sun is shining, and the temperature is in the low 60s.  I'd much rather be at home, writing this entry on my laptop while sitting outside on my balcony, enjoying a cold beverage.  Since that obviously isn't happening, all I can hope is that it's this nice again tomorrow.  I think it's supposed to be, at least according to  urlLink the Weather Channel .  Tomorrow I don't have to waste away in an office, and I'll be spending a fair portion of the afternoon out in the elements, whatever they may be.  If you're looking for me tomorrow afternoon, you'll find me at Doyt Perry Stadium in Bowling Green, taking in BGSU's spring football game.  The NCAA permits each Division I-A football team to hold fifteen practices sessions each spring.  Most teams (or maybe all of them) generally culminate these practices with a "game" that's held in their stadium and open to the public.  The coaches divide their roster into two teams which scrimmage against each other with some modified rules--a standard rule change is that defenses aren't allowed to hit the quarterbacks, who are considered down when touched.  For the most part, coaches don't install too many new plays during the spring game, since anyone (including scouts from opposing teams) could be watching.  It's a chance for the players to get some reps in a game-like environment, though.  For fans, it's a chance to get a football fix during the time of year dominated by NBA basketball, NHL hockey, and Major League Baseball.  It's also a chance to get a look at some new guys stepping into the roles of departing seniors and to see how the team is shaping up for the coming season.  For me, it's also an opportunity to break out my sweet #21 Cole Magner jersey.  I thought about rocking the helmet as well, but I think that might be a bit much for an exhibition game.  It'll see some action on Saturdays this fall, I'm sure.  The Falcons look to be in good shape for next season.  They won the MAC West Division last year, finishing the season 11-3 with a victory over Northwestern in the Motor City Bowl.  The only losses were to defending national champion Ohio State (by one touchdown, on the road, with the game coming down to the wire) and twice to MAC Champion Miami.  There are sixteen starters returning from that team, so there's definitely a solid core of experience.  However, there are definite questions about the team, and the spring game will provide our first real look at potential answers.  One of the departing seniors is QB Josh Harris, who will be calling signals on Sundays next year (actually, next year he'll probably be standing on the sidelines in a baseball cap, holding a clipboard, but at least he'll be an NFL QB--a good one after a couple of years for development).  His replacement will be redshirt sophomore Omar Jacobs, who has some big shoes to fill.  From the limited amount he's been able to show so far, though, it looks like he's more than capable of stepping right into them.  He's definitely got the physical tools (great arm, good runner), but it remains to be seen if he can become the leader that Josh was on (and off) the field.  BG has a stable of good young quarterbacks if Omar should stumble or go down with an injury.   [ Here Jon pauses in his writing to knock on wood...until his knuckles bleed.  He believes Omar will be a star, even better than Harris by the end of his career (and Jon loves Harris, so that's saying a  lot ), and wants him to be ready, willing, and able to lead the Falcons. ]   One key ingredient in the success of a quarterback is a good offensive line.  The Falcons have several players returning along the line, but injuries will keep several of them out of the spring game.  Their places will be taken by the "Five Blocks of Granite," all freshmen who redshirted last year but appear to have great promise.  The experience they get, taking snaps while the upperclassmen recover, will be invaluable down the road.  The receivers, of course, will be great if Omar can get them the ball.  The corps is led by senior Cole Magner, the "Alaskan Assassin," who is BG's jack of all trades (he was recruited as a QB).  Just call him 7-11, because he's always open...and he catches everything.  Defensively, one area that was exposed last year was pass defense with the secondary.  A large part of this was due to injuries, which resulted in some players being out and others playing out of position.  That secondary takes another hit this year with the loss of all-MAC cornerback Janssen Patton.  However, senior-to-be Keon Newson is a star in the making, and there is plenty of potential in the defensive backfield.  A new DB coach has plenty to work with.  In the box, there's plenty of experience returning up front.  All four starters along the defensive line are back for this year.  The linebacking corps took a hit with the graduation of Mitch Hewitt, but Ted Piepkow and captain Jovon Burkes saw plenty of action last year.  The depth at linebacker may be a little thin, so the Falcons can't afford any injuries.  Redshirt freshman Jenkins Reese should see some time, and is said to be a good one.  Special teams should be fine.  Nate Fry returns to handle the punting.  Placekicker Shaun Suisham needs to get better, though.  He had a great season two years ago, but fell off a bit last year.  He needs to return to form or else Coach Brandon may be tempted to attempt many fourth-down and two-point conversions.  The return teams should also be decent, with many starters working back there.  All in all, I can't wait to see the spring game.  I'm hoping to see good things from our younger players and to begin to see how everything is going to fit together for this year.  Sounds to me like a great way to spend a nice afternoon.

      Today's rhyme was brought to you by  urlLink an online rhyming dictionary , thank you very much.  I scanned the list of words it came back with, and I just thought this one was kind of funny.  I've got a dose of quick-hitters for your reading pleasure today.  * I want to be able to have a radio on my desk, dammit!  The Reds are playing a day game today, and I want to listen to it.  I caught a very little bit of it in my car on my way back from lunch, and it killed me (even moreso than usual) to have to turn it off and come back inside.  Marty Brennamen and Joe Nuxhall are a pleasure to listen to--Marty is in the Baseball Hall of Fame, and if there's any justice in this world, Joe will be too at some point.  Joe is retiring after this season, so I'm going to enjoy him while he's here.  I listened last night as the Reds got their first win of the season, 3-1 over the Chicago Cubs.  * Before I switched over to the Reds game, I listened to the end of Colin Cowherd's show on ESPN Radio.  He read an e-mail from a listener regarding Barry Bonds which I thought was hilarious.  Bonds, an outfielder with the San Francisco Giants, needs one more home run to tie Willie Mays for third on the all-time home run list with 660.  The e-mail read, in effect, "Who cares about 660?  I want to see Bonds hit #666, which is when he'll rip his face off and reveal that it is not steroids which are responsible for his success, but rather his allegiance with Satan."  * Speaking of the career home run list, it was 30 years ago today that Hank Aaron hit #715, moving past Babe Ruth into first on the all-time list, a position he still holds.  He finished his career with 755.  Bonds might approach that before he's done.  Not being a fan of Bonds, I hope that doesn't happen.  If it's to be broken by any current players, it's most likely to be Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez.  If he's the one to do it, I hope he's not playing for the Yankees by then.  I hate them.  He'd look nice in Cincinnati red, I think, and he'd be a more than adequate replacement for Barry Larkin at shortstop when Larkin retires at the end of this season.  Yeah, that'll happen...NOT!  * I'm so tired of hearing about golf and The Masters on otherwise legitimate sports media outlets.  I'm sure golf is fun to play, but it makes for lousy television and sports talk.  It's just boring.  Besides, there's a tendency to take it way too seriously.  I remember hearing recently that some famous professional golfer had a fan thrown out of an event for heckling.  Come on, that's just stupid.   Real  professional athletes deal with that kind of stuff all the time.  Ask Ken Griffey Jr. sometime about what kind of stuff he hears from fans.  It comes with the territory.  All that aside, I just can't get behind a sport that is historically racist and elitist, even more so than other sports.  If you spend any time listening to Hootie Johnson, you'll realize that not everyone involved with the sport has moved dramatically from those roots.  Fine, you don't want to admit women to Augusta National Golf Club.  It's a private club, it's your right to make that decision, and I respect that.  Now shut up.  * I successfully sewed a button onto a pair of pants last night.  It seems I'm going to evolve into a fully functional human being after all.  Really, I don't consider it that big of a deal, but I did think it worth mentioning since my last experience with sewing was half my life ago, making a duffel bag in 8th grade home economics class.  * Does today feel like Friday to anyone else?  Seriously, I have a hard time reminding myself that I have to come to work tomorrow, because it won't be Saturday.  That's going to be even harder since Brandi will be around.  * This morning on my way to work, I saw my first lightning strike of 2004.  Well, the first one that didn't originate from my own body, anyway.  I don't know what's going on, but lately I've been shocking everything and everyone I come into contact with.  I feel like Emperor Palpatine flinging electricity bolts at Luke Skywalker at the end of  Return of the Jedi .  I haven't had this much electricity in my body since I was a little kid wearing footy pajamas which would build me up with enough static electricity to flash-fry small animals.  * Road construction today on Airport Highway closed one lane in each direction.  Normally I wouldn't even mention this, since it really didn't affect traffic all that much.  However, this was a section of road on which they were doing construction for the past two years.  It just reopened fully at the beginning of last fall.  Should they need to be doing construction on it again this soon?  That doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.  Hopefully it was just a minor thing and everything will be back to normal tomorrow.  * I want to mention this briefly without getting into it too much.  A while back, the Toledo  Blade  published a series of articles on Tiger Force, an elite military unit in the Vietnam War, detailing some heinous actions the unit performed during the war.  I must preface this by saying that I did not read the articles, but got the gist of them from reading  about  them.  The  Blade  writers responsible recently won a Pulitzer Prize for these articles.  However, at the time of publication and also again recently with the announcement of the Pulitzer, the  Blade  has been receiving and publishing a good number of letters to the editor renouncing them for doing such a story.  Apparently, many of these letter-writers feel that stories like this one should not be investigated and reported on because: other countries do things much worse; it's war, and these things happen; and it's a disservice to our soldiers currently in the field.  Does this kind of thinking scare or bother anyone else?  To my way of thinking, there is  no  justification for letting this kind of story stay buried, or for refusing to hold accountable the individuals involved.  It seems to me that many of these people are blindly nationalistic and hold an attitude that the United States can do no wrong and our soldiers are heroes no matter what.  Sorry, that just doesn't hold water.  Killing other people in the course of a war is one thing, but doing it unnecessarily is murder, plain and simple, and being under the intense strain of the unique conflict of Vietnam does not excuse this in any way.

      I drive a lot.  As such, I'm subjected frequently to the incompetence of other drivers.  After being nearly killed yesterday on my way home, and after experiencing an incredibly minor inconvenience on my lunch break today, I thought I would share some driving tips that will help us all get along better on the road.  First, the stories.  I was exiting the interstate yesterday on my way home from work.  I was in the right lane, and when I came to the exit ramp, I put on my turn signal and moved to the right.  Pretty basic stuff.  At the same time, however, a driver in the FAR LEFT LANE decided he also needed to exit, so over he came in a hurry.  Unluckily for me, my car was occupying the space he was trying to merge into.  I found out in that moment that the brakes on my car still work quite well.  As I was braking, I sounded my horn to let him know I was there.  He sent some gestures my way in return, and I don't think he was wishing me good health.  I'm not sure why he was so upset, considering  he  was the one who almost smashed into  me , but hey, whatever.  Today's incident was far less significant.  I went to Wendy's for lunch, and when I got there, a car was trying to leave the parking lot through the driveway marked "Enter."  What's more, he wasn't pulled to the right side of the driveway--he was all the way over on the left, making it utterly impossible for anyone (namely me) to get into the parking lot.  I had to drive past, then turn around and come back.  Definitely not a huge deal, but irritating none the less.  I have no idea what that guy was thinking.  In that spirit, here are my driving tips.  Be glad I'm doing this for free--in some places this would be called "Remedial Driving School," and you'd have to pay for it.  Of course, if you'd  like  to pay for it, send me an e-mail and I'll reply with instructions.  I could always use extra money.  * If you driving on the interstate or any road with two lanes per direction, drive in the right lane unless you're actively passing another vehicle.  This is my biggest pet peeve.  The only exceptions to this are accident avoidance, accommodation of vehicles (especially emergency vehicles) in the shoulder, and when exit ramps (or turns) are on the left.  Drivers who cruise in the passing lane clog up the flow of traffic.  * Speaking of emergency vehicles...really, accommodate them.  If there's a cop or something in the shoulder, move over if it's at all possible, or slow down some.  If a police cruiser, ambulance, or fire truck is behind you, move over and let them pass.  Seriously.  * If you're going to pass, pass.  Don't get alongside another car and then stay there.  Likewise, if you're being passed, let them pass.  Don't speed up and stay with them.  This also stagnates the flow of traffic.  * If you are coming up on traffic that is trying to merge onto your road from an on-ramp, move over and let them in if you can.  This is just common courtesy, and I'm happy to say that people do this, for the most part.  Every now and then you come across someone who just won't get over, though.  Semis are especially bad about it.  * Conversely, if you're the one trying to merge, try as much as possible to match the speed of traffic before you get to the merging point.  It makes it a whole lot easier to get on.  Also, you're making life difficult for anyone who may be behind you.  Taking it slow and picking your spot to merge may be great for you, but it really screws everyone else who has to slow down to keep from ramming into you.  * Don't use your brakes on the interstate unless it's truly necessary.  If you need to slow down, just let off the accelerator.  Seeing brakelights at high speeds makes others (me) think something bad is about to happen.  * Use turn signals when changing lanes or turning.  I don't even care if you're in a turn-only lane, because people across the way may not know it's a turn-only lane.  It can really help people out to know where you're going, so use them.  Please.  Why wouldn't you?  I can't even attribute this to laziness, because all you have to do is flick the switch, and if you're too lazy to do that, it's likely you're comatose.  I suppose you may have to flick it again to turn the signal off if all you do is change lanes.  Otherwise, it's courteous enough to turn itself off for you.  If anyone can explain non-usage of turn signals, I would be ecstatic to have an explanation.  * Turn on your headlights when it's dark or fairly cloudy.  This is to  be seen  as much as it is for seeing.  For some reason, lately I've driven past a number of people not using headlights even at night.  Your parking lights won't always do the trick.  * If you're making a turn, and there isn't a stop sign or traffic signal, and there's no traffic keeping you from turning, you don't have to come to a complete stop before you turn.  You can keep a certain amount of speed and still make the turn successfully.  Stopping for no apparent reason tends to frustrate drivers behind you.  * Rain is not the end of the world.  A standard shower is no reason to drive twenty miles below the speed limit.  Heavier rain, perhaps.  * When stopped at a traffic signal, get through it as quickly as possible once it turns green.  Doing this means more drivers will be able to get through, which helps improve traffic flow.  * Most of all, just pay attention to what's going on around you, and try to be mindful that you aren't the only driver on the road.  Many of these things sound incredibly simple, like common sense, but there seems to be precious little of that on the roads these days.  It's incredibly frustrating to nearly be killed because someone perhaps doesn't know you're there, or to be held up by someone who doesn't appear to know or care that they're in the way.  Improving the traffic flow is going to make everyone happier in the long run.  And the short run.

        Give my love her fondest wish.    At least part of my plan for this week is working out so far.  For the second day in a row, I've managed to arrive at work on time.  Putting the alarm clock on the other side of the room seems to have done the trick, so hopefully I'm turning over a new leaf.  I hate the fact that I had to resort to a gimmick of sorts in order to achieve something so simple, but there you have it.  I'm pretty tired this morning, and that comes from my inability thus far to get to bed by 1:00 a.m. as I said I would try to do this week.  On Sunday night Brandi and I were out later than that; last night I was actually in bed by that time but couldn't sleep due to the nap I took earlier in the evening, so I got back up and stayed up until almost 3:00.  As long as I can continue to wake up and get to work on time, I'm not too concerned about it, but it would be nice to get a little more sleep and not drag through mornings all the time.  Of course, not being a morning person, dragging through mornings (no matter how much sleep I get) is part of who I am.  As per usual, I was reading instead of sleeping.  I want to talk a little bit about the book I'm reading (re-reading, actually),  Wizard and Glass  by Stephen King, which may well be my favorite book of all time.   Wizard and Glass  is the fourth book in King's Dark Tower series, which currently also comprises  The Gunslinger  (Book I),  The Drawing of the Three  (Book II),  The Waste Lands  (Book III), and  Wolves of the Calla  (Book V).  Book VI,  Song of Susannah , is due out in June; and Book VII,  The Dark Tower  (the final book in the series) in September.  Along with these books, the Tower series relates to a number of King's other novels, most notably  The Stand ,  Insomnia ,  'Salem's Lot ,  Hearts in Atlantis , and  The Eyes of the Dragon ; and  The Talisman  and  Black House , which were co-authored by Peter Straub.  Without going into too much detail and/or giving away anything vital, the Dark Tower series tells the story of Roland Deschain, the world's last gunslinger, who is on a quest to find the Dark Tower and save the world (and perhaps the universe) from the malaise which has crept into it.  It's a lot like  Lord of the Rings , except totally different.  The bulk of  Wizard and Glass  offers a slice of Roland's backstory:  a tale from his youth that went a long way toward shaping his quest and the man he has become.  At the tale's heart is a love story, the story of Roland's first and only true love:  lovely Susan, girl at the window.  He loves her and loses her, and it haunts him for the rest of his life.  The entire Dark Tower series blows me away.  King has created an entirely different world, complete with its own history, cultures, and even languages, very much like Tolkien did for  Lord of the Rings .  The amount of detail contained in this story is incredible, and I enjoy it very much.  It gives the story a certain depth, a gritty reality, a lushness that is believable despite the story's fantasy origins.  Also, as he tends to do, King gives us characters that are likeable and believable as well.  For me at least, it makes it incredibly difficult to put any of these books down once I've started.  The reason  Wizard and Glass  has become my favorite of the bunch, and perhaps my favorite in general, is because of the love story that lies at the heart of it.  Roland is 14 years old at this part of the story, and Susan, his love, is 16.  King's own teenage years lie far in his past, yet he absolutely nails the prose dealing with teenage love.  Somebody tossed ol' Steve a big fat softball, and he stepped up and drilled it out of the park.  Some of the passages are just incredible.  At any rate, that's the main reason why I have a hard time putting this book down, and why it's one of my most frequent re-reads.  At some point I'll probably get the audiobook to see if the prose sounds as good as it reads.  Then perhaps I can fall asleep while listening, instead of staying awake to read.

      Ah, spring.  There's no surer sign of the season than baseball's Opening Day.  Sure, you can crow all you want about the three official games already in the books, but to me (and a lot of baseball purists, I would think), it isn't truly Opening Day until the Cincinnati Reds open play.  They do so at 2:10 this afternoon against the Chicago Cubs at Great American Ballpark in Cincinnati.  This is the true opening of the baseball season, and an undeniable sign that spring is here.  Of course, it's currently 27° here in Toledo.  So much for spring.  I really can't complain too much, though--the sun is shining, and it's a beautiful morning.  At least it isn't raining, or worse, snowing.  The weekend was much the same:  a little chillier than I'd like, at least partially due to the ever-present Bowling Green wind, but overall pretty nice.  The weather wasn't such that it discouraged us from getting out of the apartment a little bit, at any rate.  Brandi gets off work before noon on Fridays.  She drove to BG immediately after work, so she was at my place when I got home.  Napping, actually.  I would have been more than happy to join her, being pretty tired myself, but she had decided to nap on the couch, and there wasn't really any room for me to squeeze in next to her.  It was probably better that way, though--by staying awake, I kept my momentum; whereas if I had fallen asleep it likely would have spelled the end of the evening.  She woke up shortly after I got home, with only a little assistance from me.  We got ourselves ready and went out for dinner that night with our friend Cricket.  We went to a place called SamB's, which is a nice little restaurant in downtown Bowling Green.  It's a really good place to eat--my only complaint is that they change the menu all the time, and whatever I had the previous time (which has always been great) is no longer available.  That's probably a good thing, though, as it forces me to try something new.  At any rate, we sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table.  The wait was about 45 minutes, but it was worth it--the food was awesome.  Besides, we hadn't seen Cricket for a while, and it was cool to hang out.  After dinner, Brandi and I went to BW3 to have a few more drinks and just hang out.  That was fun, as always.  There was a Cleveland Cavs game on, so we got to see a little bit of that.  We also played the interactive trivia, which we always have a good time with.  Brandi ran into an old friend who's going to try to help her get a job in Toledo, which would be awesome.  We didn't close the place down, at least in part because I was still tired, but it was fun to hang out and wind down for a while.  On Saturday we took our time about waking up.  We slept in, then hung out on the couch in front of the television.  Eventually we got out of the house a little bit, to go out for ice cream.  We tried to go to Beyond 2000, which was a place in downtown BG that featured hand-dipped ice cream, but we discovered that it had gone out of business a few days before.  I don't quite understand why an ice cream shop would cease operations just before spring, but that's what happened.  We still wanted ice cream, so we ended up at Dairy Queen.  That's not bad, though--we got some french fries to snack on as well, and they're great.  The Dairy Queen in BG is also known for serving up large portions, which is a bonus.  From there we went to the Wood County Humane Society to visit the animals, as we do from time to time.  We hadn't been there for a few weeks (as Brandi hasn't been in town for a few weeks), and the cat we liked so much last time was gone.  Hopefully he found a good home.  We played with the cats for a while, which was fun.  We also went to see the dogs this time, which we hadn't done before.  That wasn't as much fun, as you're not allowed to reach into the kennels and pet them.  Also, all the dogs they had were enormous.  I'm more of a mid-sized dog fan.  I like all dogs, of course, but mid-sized ones just fit me better.  Small dogs are too yippy and annoying, and big dogs are...well, they're just too big.  That evening, Brandi met up with her friend Rachel, and they went out for a while.  They had dinner and hung out while I ostensibly watched the Final Four games.  Actually I ended up sleeping on the couch for most of the first game, and Brandi came home at the beginning of the second.  We watched that game together and then caught most of Saturday Night Live before going to bed.  On Sunday I slept in while Brandi got up and went rollerblading.  When she got back, we cleaned up and went out for a bit.  Due to Georgia Tech's defeat of Oklahoma State in the Final Four the night before, Brandi won our little wager on the brackets, so I took her shopping.  It was actually a pretty good time.  That night we went to Cricket's recital--she sang/conducted about twenty songs, which is something she had to do for her Master's degree.  After the recital, Brandi and I went with Cricket and her boyfriend Adam and a whole slew of others to a townie bar in BG which was having Sunday night karaoke.  That was pretty entertaining.  The people who sang from our group, being made up mostly of vocal education types, were pretty good (I'm proud to say that Brandi's rendition of "Dancing Queen" was quite good--I love it when she sings).  The other people in the bar, not so great.  It's always fun to watch, though.  We were out pretty late, though, which made getting up this morning tough.  I did put my alarm clock across the room from my bed, though, and thus managed to make it to work on time this morning.  That's a good thing.  Now I just hope I can keep it up.  Brandi had to drive back today, as she has to work this afternoon.  I know she hates that--she really dreads leaving BG now.  She gets to come back on Thursday of this week, though, so it'll be a short one for her, and in only a couple of months she'll be back in BG for good.  That'll be nice for both of us.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a baseball score to monitor.  Let's play ball!

      There was a time, not all that long ago, when I absolutely hated my job.  I dreaded coming in each day, and the mere thought of it made me miserable.  That was right after I took over the purchasing duties.  Nothing in my background prepared me for this job, and I received a grand total of two hours of training from someone who didn't know what he was doing in the first place.  I was thrown directly into the fire, and I came to work each day feeling utterly unprepared.  I didn't like that at all.  Now I've been in this position for a full year and a half.  There are still occasions when something arises that I haven't dealt with before, but for the most part I've got a pretty good handle on everything.  I no longer despise my job.  I'm generally pretty indifferent.  I don't like it that much, but I can deal with it.  It helps me pay the bills, and that's the important part.  There are quite a few things about this job that bother me, and I complain about them a fair amount, both in this blog and in "real life."  With that in mind, and in the interests of equal time, today I'm going to say something nice.  Occasionally there are days when I actively like this job.  Granted, I would never choose it over sitting on the couch in front of my PlayStation, or watching Falcon football, but on these days I can at least get some mild enjoyment out of being here and doing what I do.  Today was one of those days.  We haven't been very busy here lately, and today was no exception.  Busy days are better, because the time goes faster.  Today was most assuredly not busy, but there have been some things I've had to take care of.  There were a variety of things, and that made it nice.  I wasn't sitting here doing the same thing all day long.  Beyond that, I still feel like I'm out of my element sometimes.  When I can get through a number of things and get them all cleared up, I feel really good about myself.  I'm overcoming my own lack of experience, and I enjoy being able to do that.  While I'm on the topic, another thing I like about this job (sometimes) is meeting with salespeople.  I don't like this every time, and I really get irritated when someone just drops by and wants to try to sell me something.  However, with established vendors, there are a couple of representatives I really like.  I enjoy when these people stop in and chat for a few minutes.  Of course, there are also some established vendors with reps that I actively  don't  like, but I try to avoid them when I can.

      That was fast, eh?  I'm still tweaking a couple of things, so there may be some issues over the course of the day.  I'll try to have them all fixed by the time I head out of town for the weekend.  For today, though, if you visit and something is wrong, just give me some time and try again later.  If there are still problems past this afternoon, let me know.  Thanks!

      Now that I've confirmed my suspicion that virtually no one is reading my blog, it's time for another real entry.  Let's discuss something I care deeply about, and that's...sports!  It's been a frustrating sports week for me so far.  ESPN and various sports shows I pay vague attention to have been dominated mostly by Phil Mickelson and the Masters, and by Barry Bonds hitting his 660th and 661st home runs.  It so happens that I hate golf and Barry Bonds, so these topics do nothing for me.  The Cleveland Cavs finished their season last night and won't be advancing into the NBA playoffs.  Also, the Reds had an off day and then were rained out, so there hasn't been any action there.  That being the case, let's start with a sport that's currently out of season.  Yesterday the NFL released its schedule for the coming season.  I haven't looked at it yet, but I did hear that the Cincinnati Bengals will be making two appearances on national television.  One of these will be a coveted Monday Night Football game, the Bengals' first appearance on Monday Night in 11 years.  I think this shows that fans and media are no longer looking at Cincinnati as the league's laughingstock.  Hopefully QB Carson Palmer can do well in his first year as starter and lead the Bengals into the playoffs.  On the topic of football...last week BGSU's football team hired Vance Joseph to coach the defensive backs.  Until recently, Joseph was filling the same position at Colorado.  However, he was placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation of the football program regarding some sexual assault charges against some players and recruits.  Under these circumstances, Joseph resigned at Colorado and accepted the position at Bowling Green when offered by BGSU head coach Gregg Brandon.  This hire has caused at least some controversy to surround BGSU's football program.  I'm not as worried as some, but it did raise a small red flag in my mind.  I do trust that Coach Brandon and BGSU Athletic Director Paul Krebs checked into the matter and were satisfied with what they found out, and I'm also sure he's a good coach, as Colorado is a good football program ( on  the field, at least).  Still, with Joseph being placed on leave at Colorado, you can't help but wonder what his role was in all of this (also suspended was CU head coach Gary Barnett).  If this turns sour on the BGSU program, so recently recovered from the ashes, I will be sorely disappointed.  The NBA's regular season came to an end last night.  This is the first year I've paid any attention to the NBA, due 100% to Lebron James.  I've become a bona fide Cleveland Cavaliers fan.  Unfortunately, they didn't make the playoffs, so we won't get to see Lebron play again until next season.  He was a lot of fun to watch, though.  I think they would have made the playoffs if they could have started the season with the roster they finished it with.  They made some trades over the course of the season that really improved the team, most notably the acquisition of point guard Jeff McInnis.  That allowed Lebron to slide over to his more natural shooting guard spot.  The Cavs have a good core of starters, with Lebron, Carlos Boozer, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and McInnis.  I see them in the playoffs next year for sure.  Speaking of basketball, my new PlayStation2 basketball game sure is fun.  It's EA Sports March Madness 2004, which Brandi gave me over the weekend.  I like it a whole lot.  I love college hoops, and I love video games.  Combine the two, and you've got a very happy man.  The game is hard right now because I'm just getting started and there are a  lot  of things you can do, which makes the learning curve a little steep.  I'm getting better, though, and it's a whole lot of fun.  The start of the NHL playoffs means only one thing:  boring sports on television.  I like hockey well enough, but I can't get into the NHL.  I like Olympic hockey, and college hockey is fun.  I won't be sad at all if the NHL has a work stoppage this offseason like they're expected to, and they don't come back for a while.  Make it go away.

        Although I'm not Jimmy Fallon, Tina Fey, Colin Quinn, Norm McDonald, Dennis Miller, nor, unfortunately, Kevin Nealon.    What is going on with gas prices these days?  Come on, man, give us a break.  Price fluctuations at least used to be predictable--they'd go up toward the weekend, and drop back down toward the middle of the week.  Now it seems like they're going up all the time, and dropping even more sporadically.  I was lucky today--I noticed as I walked out of Subway on my lunch break that gas prices at surrounding stations had gone up to $1.89 per gallon.  I needed to get gas, so on my way back to work I noticed a station which hadn't yet raised their prices.  I snuck in at $1.72 per gallon:  a clerk was on the way out to change the prices on their sign as I started fueling.  I'm hoping this tank can last up until I'm ready to drive to Stow for the weekend.  Speaking of weekends, I didn't post my usual weekend recap yesterday since I had other stuff I wanted to talk about.  I would hate to neglect anyone who might be living vicariously through me, though, so without further ado, here's the tale of the weekend.  Unlike at least one person I can think of, Brandi didn't have to work on Good Friday (and has there ever been a more redundant phrase than that one?).  She got off work early on Thursday and headed toward BG.  She stopped off in her hometown of Clyde to spend some time with her parents, and I drove over and met her there when I got off work.  Her stepmom made dinner for us--I felt a little bad because she made shrimp for everyone else but pork chops for me, since I don't like seafood.  The food was great, though.  We hung out there for a while (and took her dog for a walk) and then headed back to Bowling Green.  There was a pit stop at Meijer on the way to my apartment, as Brandi remembered during the drive that she had an interview on Friday morning but hadn't brought anything to wear.  We turned in fairly early that night, as we were both pretty tired and had to get up early the next morning.  Brandi was lounging on the couch when I got home from work.  We watched  That 70s Show  and then went to the mall so I could get a haircut.  I hate getting my hair cut, so I wasn't exactly looking forward to this, but we went.  After said haircut, we drove up to Toledo and met up with Adam and Cricket for a Toledo Mud Hens (minor league baseball) game.  The game was a good time, as usual, and there was a fireworks show afterwards.  Then the four of us went to a local bar to hang out for a little bit.  When Brandi and I got home, we exchanged gifts for our one-year dating anniversary.  I got a college basketball video game; she got a collection of lotion and perfume (etc.) that she likes from Victoria's Secret, and also a Care Bear with a cupcake on its belly.  On Saturday morning I got up and went to BGSU's spring football game.  Since it was being held on the practice field instead of in the stadium (hence no bleachers), Brandi opted not to go.  She exercised and went for a run instead.  I was gone for a couple of hours, then we napped on the couch for a little bit after I got back.  We slept for maybe a couple of hours, then got up and started getting ready to go out for the evening.  I took Brandi to the Spaghetti Warehouse for our first date, so on Saturday we returned to the scene of the crime.  We got there at a good time, and only had to wait a few minutes for a table.  The food was awesome (I had lasagna, Brandi had shrimp alfredo), up to and including the 12-layer chocolate cake we had for dessert.  After that we drove around Toledo for a bit.  We had reservations at a comedy club at 10:30, but doors didn't open until 9:45, and we had plenty of time to kill since dinner didn't take as long as we expected.  So we had a nice ride, and Brandi showed me the place where she had interviewed on Friday.  That was a pretty decent way from where we were, so by the time we got back to the comedy club, they were letting people in.  The comedy club here in Toledo is called  urlLink Connxtions .  I've been there a few times now, and it's always been a great time.  Saturday was no exception.  The comics were  urlLink Dan DeCapua  and  urlLink Don Reese , and both of them were absolutely hilarious.  I had tears in my eyes at several points.  Reese especially had a warped sense of humor that really appealed to me (and Brandi as well, I'm  very  happy to say).  After the comedy club, we drove back to BG and went to BW3 to have a drink.  We played some games and ended up chatting with a guy named Bruce who I think is in there every single night.  He's always there when we're there, at least.  He was pretty cool, though.  Before the bars closed, Brandi and I went to a dance club called Uptown to dance a little bit.  It was really crowded and hot and hard to dance, but it was fun to be in there for a few minutes.  We headed home after that.  We started playing the basketball game Brandi had bought me, but she was hungry and ended up ordering some food.  We watched a slam dunk competition while we ate.  As soon as the food was gone, Brandi (who had consumed a pretty fair amount of alcohol over the course of the evening) fell immediately asleep, and I soon followed suit.  We got up on Sunday and drove down to Troy for Easter with my family.  I personally care nothing for Easter itself, but it is one of those get-together occasions for my family, and I didn't want to miss it.  My mom put out a pretty good spread, as she always does, and the food was awesome.  I ended up bringing quite a bit of it back to my apartment, as well as some miscellaneous items Mom had been collecting for me over the past several weeks since last I was home.  On the way back to Bowling Green that evening, Brandi and I stopped in to see our friends Amy and Doug.  Amy is actually a girl I dated back in high school and into my college days, but we managed to stay friends even after we broke up.  She and Doug are married, and we always have a good time when the four of us get together.  We sat in their living room and talked as we were pawed and clawed by Caroline, the more social of Amy's two cats.  We didn't actually get back to Bowling Green until about 1:30, but it was worth it.  While at Amy and Doug's house we all ended up talking about a couple of relationships/marriages involving crazy people who got married too young and/or did bad things to their spouses.  Brandi and I ended up carrying that conversation into the car on the way back, which led into a discussion of our past relationships.  You'd think that would be a bit awkward, but it was actually good conversation.  It took up most of the drive, which was about an hour and a half.  I'm really glad that she and I can talk about stuff like that without freaking out totally.  When we got back to BG, I helped Brandi figure out her taxes so she can file them this week.  Of course, I had to get up on Monday morning and come back to work, and Brandi had to drive back to Stow to do the same.  Unfortunate, but that's the way our schedules work right now.  We don't have as many plans for this coming weekend, so hopefully we'll get a little more time to just relax together.

       urlLink Orange Defeats White in BGSU Spring Game, 17-13   The field at Doyt Perry Stadium was in bad shape at the end of last season.  It was impossible to fix during the winter, and recent wet weather has kept the grounds crew from working on it yet this spring.  Therefore, the spring game was moved to the practice field adjacent to the stadium.  I wasn't thrilled when I first heard about this.  The practice field has no bleachers or seating of any kind, and I wasn't optimistic about being able to see much.  As it turned out, I liked it very much.  There were definitely some line-of-sight issues, but being down on the field, essentially right on the sidelines with the players, is an interesting vantage point to take in a game.  I wouldn't mind if the spring game were held there from now on.  For one thing, you can hear the players and coaches as they chatter amongst themselves.  Despite some raw language (which doesn't bother me, but I'm sure it does/did some people), this is pretty interesting.  It lets you see how they communicate about different things.  One thing I really liked was hearing some of the upperclassmen giving tips to some of the younger guys, talking about what they saw on the field and why they reacted a certain way.  Besides that, being so close really gives you a different perspective on the game itself.  When you're right there as the players come on and off the field, you get a sense for how big they really are.  In most cases, they're just monstrous.  One player in particular, an offensive lineman, was just a beast--he's listed as 6-5, 323, and he's every bit of that.  I noticed a couple other players who were no taller than I am (5-9), despite having a significantly taller "program height."  The biggest thing about being so close to the action, though, is getting a real sense of how fast the game is and how hard the hits are.  Some of these guys can really fly, and they hit hard.  This was all teammate-on-teammate stuff too, so I can only imagine how much more vicious it can be during real game action.  I came away with even more respect for these athletes than I had before, and that's saying something.  Here are some players who caught my eye:  Omar Jacobs, redshirt sophomore quarterback.  Omar is going to be "The Man" this year, replacing departed senior Josh Harris.  It may take some time for him to grow into Josh's leadership role, but he's got the tools to be as good of a quarterback.  He can really fire the ball--when he wants it somewhere, he gets it there, RIGHT NOW.  I think he did a good job of making decisions about staying in the pocket vs. taking off with the ball.  When he decides to run, he can really haul the mail.  He's fast for a quarterback.  He's not Michael Vick, but he looks to be faster than Josh was.  Josh was quite a running quarterback, so Omar is going to be a heck of a weapon.  Redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Thurman.  Thurman threw the prettiest ball of the day, a long spiraling strike to wide receiver Steve Sanders.  I also liked Thurman's leadership skills and the way he talked to his receivers and offense on the sidelines.  I'm not sure if Thurman or Van Johnson will be the #2 quarterback going into the season, but my vote would be for Thurman.  I think he would have the best chance to lead us to a win if Omar was out.  Johnson also looked good during his chances, though.  The running backs.  All of them that played:  incumbent starter P.J. Pope (true junior), Raishaun Stover (redshirt sophomore), Dan Macon (true sophomore), and Melvin Cole (redshirt freshman).  Incumbent backup B.J. Lane did not play.  All that did play showed good moves and speed.  Macon had the long run of the day, a 72-yarder around the right side.  It was hard to single out individuals, but the offensive linemen did a good job for the most part.  They gave the quarterbacks time to look for receivers.  They gave up some sacks, but we've got some injuries there right now.  I'm not concerned about it just yet.  If the injured players aren't ready for the start of the season, the first game or two may have some issues along the line.  Junior linebacker Ted Piepkow.  Teddy saw a lot of time last year due to injuries, and shined.  During the spring game, he was in on a lot of tackles.  He was flying around and making hits.  Linebacker may be our weak spot this year in terms of depth, but I think Ted's going to be a good one.  Senior defensive end Ryan Newble.  He was a force along the defensive front.  He had several tackles, at least one sack, and an interception that essentially ended the game.  He looked good.  The Falcons have plenty of experience coming back on the defensive line, and that's going to be a real strength of our team.  Here's hoping Newble is wreaking havoc like that all year long.  Anyway, that's what stood out to me.  Obviously, I'm not a football expert, and it's easier for me to pick things out on offense than it is on defense.  The angle of being on the field didn't help much with that, either.  All in all, though, the guys looked really good.  They were into the game, which was good to see (one former player, who now does the radio broadcasts, was walking around the sidelines, and I heard him say that the winning team would be served steak for dinner, while the losing team would be eating hamburgers and hot dogs).  It was a nice little football fix for junkies like me who were anxious to get an early look at the team before the season starts this fall.

      Today is April 12, 2004.  One year ago today, Brandi and I went out on our first date.  It was a Saturday.  I went to BGSU's spring football game that afternoon, then came home and watched a Reds game on television (and perhaps napped a bit on the couch) before showering and getting dressed and ready.  If I remember correctly, I showed up at Brandi's apartment at 6:00.  We hung out and chatted there for a little while, and then went out.  We went to dinner at The Spaghetti Warehouse in Toledo.  Afterwards we went to Showcase Cinemas in Maumee to see Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson in  Anger Management .  Then we went to a bar called Brewster's in BG, which was far too loud and crowded for our tastes at the time, and from there we went to BW3.  We had a drink or two there, and then went back to my apartment to watch movies and hang out a little bit longer.  The movies we watched were  As Good as it Gets  and  The Wedding Singer  (sticking with Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler), and we continued talking and getting to know each other.  Neither of us wanted the night to end, and thus she ended up staying over.  I took her home the next afternoon shortly before she had to go to work.  Needless to say, it was a magical evening, and one of the first building blocks in where we are today.  Getting here was no easy task.  When we first started dating, Brandi had just recently come out of a relationship and didn't feel ready to jump right into another.  I had been out of my last relationship for a longer period of time, but after being in a relationship nearly constantly for nine years (one for three, another on and off for six), I was planning to enjoy the single life for a while.  Neither of us was looking for what we found.  Some interesting anecdotes from early on....  When Brandi and I first met, I was kind of seeing her friend Cricket.  I went out to BW3 one Wednesday to meet up with Cricket at their karaoke night, and Brandi was there.  After hanging out for a bit, the three of us eventually moved on to a place called Skybar.  Eventually Brandi and I struck up a conversation.  She was still dating her ex-boyfriend at that time, and we were actually talking mostly about that, but it was enough to sow the seeds of a mutual attraction.  The second time we ran into each other is when I got her number and we actually decided to go out sometime.  That was an interesting evening, to say the least.  See, I originally went out to meet up with another girl (Sarah) that I had met recently.  However, the bar where we decided to meet up was a place that I was known to frequent, so Cricket and Brandi went there to look for me.  They found me before Sarah did.  This put me in a weird spot, because I was worried about screwing things up with Cricket.  So I blew Sarah off, stopped looking for her, and luckily didn't run into her.  I felt bad about that, but I saw it as my only option at the time--I don't think Cricket was under any impressions that she was the only girl I was seeing, but I still thought it might be a bit awkward for all of us to run into each other.  At any rate, it turned out not to matter, as both Cricket and Sarah soon became romantically irrelevant.  The first thing Brandi said to me that night was "My boyfriend broke up with me."  I picked up on that as a signal right away and let it set the tone for the evening.  Eventually the three of us ended up in a group out on the dance floor, where Brandi and I kept talking.  It came out at some point that we were attracted to each other, and we decided to get together and go out sometime.  I felt a little weird about it, since this was Cricket's friend, but really, I knew already that things were going nowhere with Cricket (in terms of dating, that is...she's very cool, and we're all friends now--she's dating my friend and former roommate Adam, and we hang out relatively often); I even had a sense (which was later confirmed by Brandi) that Cricket knew what was going on and was cool with it.  Anyway, Brandi and I started dancing together, and before the night had ended we were holding hands and she had kissed me on the cheek.  Nothing major, especially considering some of the goings-on at college bars, but plenty for my mind, which was already overloaded with the evening's proceedings (and a fine layer of alcohol).  Brandi and I started dating in April, and I moved into a new apartment in May.  In between, we spent a lot of time at her place.  I ended up staying over pretty frequently.  We'd usually talk the night away and well into the morning.  Sleeping there was interesting at any rate.  Her bedroom was immediately next to a railroad track, and it was pretty common to be awoken by a train rumbling past, blowing its horn.  Also, not too far from her apartment was a charming little pig-slaughtering facility.  Occasionally we'd be lulled to sleep (or jarred from it) by the lovely sound of pigs shrieking their last breaths away.  Still, I wouldn't trade those times for anything.  That was when she and I got to know each other.  We talked openly about the obstacles facing our relationship, and that helped open our lines of communication.  As we talked, we realized that it wasn't going to be easy, but I think that's also when we began to discover that it would be worth it.  Early on, I think it would have been easy for either of us to call it off.  As I've said, there was plenty of stuff in our way, and neither of us went into this looking for a long-term relationship.  However, as we continued to spend time together, we started falling for each other, almost against our wills.  It just happened.  Eventually I came to realize that it would be harder for me to be without her than it would be for us to work through our difficulties.  It seems that she came to that conclusion as well.  So that's where we started from, around this time last year.  Now we've been together for this long, and we're planning to move in together soon.  I think this is a good move for us, and I'm excited about it.  She'll be back in BG in August, at the latest, and I can't wait to have her.

      I heard on  Mike and Mike in the Morning  today on ESPN Radio that Eli Manning really is prepared to sit out for a year if he's drafted by the Chargers.  That's a bold move on his part, and really says how much he doesn't want to play in San Diego.  I can't imagine he'll be nearly as coveted in next year's draft after taking a full year off, and being taken later in the draft could cost him millions of dollars.  Of course, the ultimate irony would be if he sat out a year, and then got drafted by San Diego again the following year anyway.  At what point would the madness end?  It just drives me crazy that the Mannings (Eli and his father Archie, himself a former NFL quarterback) have tried to influence the draft.  So the Chargers suck.  That's why they're first in the draft, and that's why they're going to give you a fat contract if they decide to pick you.  It's how the draft works.  You're supposed to go there and help them get better.  Play out your contract, and leave when it expires if you don't like it.  It's called "paying your dues," and I don't think Eli Manning should be exempt from it just because his family has a history of successful NFL quarterbacking.  All that aside, I still think San Diego should trade the pick or at least take someone else with the first pick.  You just don't know what's going to happen if you pick Manning, and there are plenty of other worthy choices out there.  The Chargers have plenty of needs, and Drew Brees will be a serviceable quarterback for them if it comes to that.  If they really want a quarterback, as I said yesterday, I doubt Manning is their best choice anyway.  Here's another thing that bugs me crazy about the NFL draft.  Since the end of the college football season, Ben Roethlisberger has dropped a bit in terms of draft status, while Manning and Philip Rivers have risen, to a point where Roethlisberger will almost certainly be the third quarterback taken.  Between the end of the season and the draft, they have all these combines and workouts where the players show off for scouts--doing sprints and bench-presses, throwing the ball in shorts and t-shirts with no pass rush, etc.  This causes some players to come out of nowhere and rocket to the top of the draft, whereas other players drop down the board.  The same thing happens, to a certain extent, with college recruitment of high school players.  I think this is why there are so many first-round picks that never really amount to anything.  Teams are basing decisions on athletic ability, potential, and measurables, and never mind if the kid can actually play football or not.  There are so many intangibles to playing football that I can't believe anyone thinks that basing decisions on these workouts is a good idea.  Sure, they should factor into the decision, but the main component should always be watching tape of actual games and seeing how they play the game.  What a concept.  Of course, some people have suggested that Roethlisberger has slipped due to questions about the level of competition he played against in college.  Give me a break.  Anyone who knows a damned thing about college football knows that the MAC isn't that far off from the "big boys" anymore.  I know there used to be a significant gap, but that gap is closing.  With the recent conference re-alignment, I'd take the MAC right now over the Big East, which somehow will still retain its BCS affiliation.  In the long run, I think Roethlisberger and Josh Harris--both MAC players--will be the jewels of this draft's quarterback class.

      So Eli Manning doesn't want to be drafted by the Chargers, eh?  San Diego has the first pick, and most "experts" think Manning will be the first player drafted.  If Manning doesn't want to play for the Chargers, I say "too damn bad."  That's what the draft is about--the  teams  select the  players , not the other way around.  If the Chargers select Manning, he has two choices--he can sign and play for them, or he can sit out a year and go back into the draft next year.  If I were the Chargers, I think I'd draft him out of spite.  Of course, a team's first-round pick (and especially the first pick overall) is too valuable to waste on such a move.  I doubt he would, but if he did opt to sit out a year, that's a pick wasted, and the Chargers can't afford that.  They sucked last year, and they can't waste their first pick.  I heard a possible scenario on the radio yesterday that I think is San Diego's best option.  The Chargers can trade the #1 pick to the New York Giants for receiver Ike Hilliard and New York's first-round pick, which is #4 overall.  The Giants can select Manning, who they want badly, and who also seems to want to play there.  The Chargers can then trade that #4 pick to Cleveland for receiver Dennis Northcutt and the Browns' first-round selection, which is #7 overall.  This would give the Chargers two good receivers, and if they still want to draft a quarterback in the first round, Ben Roethlisberger from Miami will almost certainly still be available at #7.  For what it's worth, I think Roethlisberger will be a better pro quarterback than Manning anyway.  I've seen Roethlisberger play on several occasions, including twice in person, and he's the real deal.  He's far and away the best passer I've seen in person (a list that includes current NFL quarterbacks Daunte Culpepper, Chad Pennington, and Byron Leftwich).  He throws a pretty ball--his spirals are tight, and his passes are on the money, even in the cutting Bowling Green wind.  He doesn't get rattled often in the pocket, and he moves pretty well for a guy his size as well.  I think Manning's status as the probably #1 pick is mostly dependent on his name.  Peyton Manning, Eli's brother, is a hell of a quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts.  I just don't think Eli is nearly as good.  His pocket presence and leadership may be similar, and that's big, but I don't think his physical tools are on the same level.  Roethlisberger's are, and he's got or will develop the rest.  My main interest in this year's draft lies in another quarterback, BGSU's own Josh Harris.  He's projected to go in the third or fourth round, and I'm very excited to see where he ends up.  He'll be the first BG player drafted since my afflitiation with the school began in 1997.  I think he'll be a good starting quarterback in the league someday, after carrying a clipboard for a couple of years and learning.  He was an outstanding college quarterback, and he's got all the tools needed to be great in the pros.  He just needs some time and seasoning to learn how to utilize them.  His biggest tool is his speed and quickness--he can definitely avoid a rush.  He's built like a linebacker, so he's hard to bring down.  He's got good arm strength and can make all the throws.  He was a bit erratic with his passes in college, but his most important asset, and what made him a hero to everyone who follows BG football, is that he's a playmaker.  The kid can just play football, and he's clutch.  I was always confident when we needed a big play and the ball was in Josh's hands.  I knew he'd make it, and he did.  If he can continue that in the NFL, he'll be a star in the long run.  The latest rumor I've heard about Josh has him going to the Browns in I think the fourth round.  There are some positives to this.  I'd be able to go see him play again whenever I wanted, since Cleveland isn't far at all, and Jeff Garcia would be a good quarterback for him to learn from.  Other than that, I'm totally against him going to the Browns.  Personally, I hate them, having grown up in the shadow of Cincinnati as a Bengals fan (poor, tortured souls that we are).  If Josh ends up there, I'll root for him to do exceptionally well personally, but for Cleveland's defense to be spectacularly bad so that he can succeed and the team can still lose.  Beyond my personal feelings, though, Cleveland is just a screwed-up organization right now, and I think it would be better for Josh if he didn't get caught up in that.  Of course, the biggest issue surrounding this year's draft is the issue of Maurice Clarett and Mike Williams and underclassmen eligibility.  The current rule is that players cannot be drafted if less than three years have passed since the graduation of their high school classes.  This rule was negotiated between the NFL and the players' union, and is included in their Collective Bargaining Agreement.  Clarett has taken the NFL to court to get this rule overturned so he can be included in this year's draft, one year earlier than he could be drafted otherwise.  This case is currently in the hands of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is expected to make a ruling before Saturday.  As it stands now, Clarett can not be drafted.  His initial lawsuit resulted in the rule being overturned, at which time he declared for the draft, as did USC's Mike Williams.  However, a stay was granted to the NFL by a higher court, putting Clarett and Williams out of the draft.  Clarett then appealed to the Supreme Court for an emergency lift of the stay, and Williams filed a separate lawsuit against the NFL.  That's where it stands now, and theoretically this will all be sorted out by draft day.  I can see both sides of the argument.  On one hand, I think Clarett has a right to seek employment.  Teams are obviously interested in him, and in other players who are currently "too young" to be in the NFL.  This isn't like becoming a doctor, where a certain degree is an absolute requirement.  It's an age restriction, imposed somewhat arbitrarily, and which may not entirely be fair.  On the other hand, I think the NFL has a right to determine their own qualifications for employment.  The problem here lies in the fact that the NFL itself would not be employing these players; the individual teams would be.  We've already seen that a lot of teams have at least some interest in Clarett, so the NFL is restricting their ability to hire him.  However, the NFL has to do this in order to protect its own product.  Letting these young, underexperienced players into the league will, over time, dilute the quality of play on the field.  Look at the NBA.  Many players leave college after a year or two to enter the draft, or skip college entirely and go pro right out of high school, and the NBA suffers for it.  Teams draft these young players based on "potential," and then essentially pay them to sit on the bench for the first several years to learn how to play.  This is not a good thing for the league.  The draft is designed to help poor teams get better in a timely manner--this is why bad teams draft first.  However, when these teams select "project" players that need a few years of development, it defeats the purpose.  They can't step in and help right away.  They aren't ready.  Lebron James and Carmelo Anthony have proven that there are exceptions to the rule--sometimes young players  are  ready to come in and play right away.  Sometimes.  Not often, though.  Even Kobe Bryant didn't come in and start right away.  And the NBA is a totally different animal from the NFL.  Professional football is a violent, grueling game, and if these young kids come in unprepared, they're going to get mauled.  It's just the way it is.  I'm sure there are some kids who will be ready before those three years have elapsed (Williams is one, but I doubt Clarett is...he couldn't even get through a full season of college football without missing time for various injuries).  All of this, however, deals with the "rightness" of the rule, and not the "legality."  I don't know about that part, not being a lawyer myself.  The rule is included in the league's Collective Bargaining Agreement, and most stuff I've heard seems to indicate that it will eventually stand up, but who knows?  We'll find out sometime between now and noon on Saturday, I would imagine.  If it does stand up, look for the NBA to push for an age requirement to enter that league as well.  As a fan, I think rules like this are good for all involved.  Including the kids.  Sure, it's hard to argue that they don't have a right to be employed if they're good enough.  However, "good enough" is a totally subjective assessment.  I'm sure if these rules go away that there will be plenty of kids who think they're the best players ever and forfeit their college eligibility in an effort to be drafted, and they're screwed if it doesn't happen.  I suppose in America they should have the freedom to screw up their lives, but I think it's better if they don't.  All of that being the case, here's my suggestion for a compromise.  If these kids are hellbent on not going to college, let them enter the draft.  If they're good enough, fine--they'll get drafted, they'll make the roster, they'll play.  However, have a supplemental draft a week or two after the regular draft (they do this now, but it's tied into the following year's draft, which would no longer be the case under my proposal).  This draft would be aimed at the younger players, but I suppose anyone could be taken.  There would be roster exemptions for players in this draft, so that they could be on the team but not count against the roster limits.  These players' pay scales would be limited in some way, as would their eligibility to play in games, and there would have to be some sort of rule governing how long (in terms of years) they would be allowed to be exempt.  Short of expecting these players to go to college for a certain number of years, I think this would be the best way to let younger players into the league fairly, without sacrificing the quality of play.

      Due to our ISP switchover yesterday afternoon, our internet connection was down for a while.  It was offline when I came back from lunch at 1:00, and remained so until around 3:00.  One result of this downtime is that I didn't get to attend to my blog as well as I intended.  One thing I would have mentioned yesterday, had I been able to, was that the Reds game against the Braves was scheduled to be televised on TBS.  I hadn't been able to see the Reds play yet this year, so I was pretty stoked about that.  Time Warner Cable in Bowling Green used to televise available Reds game on an unused channel, but they don't seem to be doing that this year.  I was planning to make a joke that, with my luck, the game would be rained out and I wouldn't be able to watch it.  Silly me.  I should have known better.  The game went on as scheduled.  The Reds won, and it was a good, classic game:  close and low-scoring (3-2), with good pitching on both sides.  Also, it was a short game, lasting only two hours and twenty-seven minutes.  In short, it was everything a baseball fan could want.  I didn't see it.  When I got home from work yesterday, my cable service was out.  I turned on my TV to watch ESPN's  Pardon the Interruption  and got nothing but static.  I figured it was a temporary outage and would be back on soon.  As it approached gametime, still with no cable, I attempted to call the cable company.  After choosing the menu option that indicated I was calling about cable television service, I got nothing but a buzzing noise.  I tried to call several more times over the course of the evening, with the same result.  Of course, in addition to providing me with cable television service, my cable company is also my ISP.  As luck would have it, my cable modem was down as well.  I had no television and no internet, and I felt totally disconnected from the outside world.  My cable finally started working again around 11:30 last night.  Unfortunately, the Reds game ended at 9:30.  At least I was able to check the box score.  Losing my cable for several hours wasn't the end of the world.  I'm aware of that.  It just irritates me, because I really don't sit down in front of the television and actually watch it all that often.  I have it on a lot, but mostly I'm doing other things.  Last night was one of the rare occasions when there was something I really wanted to see, and that was when the cable was out.  I know that's just the way things go sometimes, but it's frustrating.  As luck would have it, none of the remaining games of this series will be televised, even on Atlanta's network.  It may be a while before I get to see the Reds play, and I may have to drive down to Cincinnati and visit Great American Ball Park to do it.  I plan on doing that at some point anyway, but it would be nice to catch a game or two on the tube in the meantime.  I'm tempted to call the cable company to see if those lost hours will be credited to my bill, but I think I know how far I'll get with that.

      I'm extremely happy to announce that we got our new internet connection at work today.  It's not blazing fast, but it's substantially better than the mind-numbing connection we had before.  This is going to make me much more content.  No longer will I be tempted to gouge out my eyes in the time it takes to load up a page from which I need only a tiny bit of information.  There are still a few glitches and bugs, but I'm confident that we'll work them out over the next several days.  Hell, the new connection has only been live for 40 minutes.  Even if we can't get this stuff worked out, it's already less glitchy and buggy than the old system.  No complaints from me.

      In the movie  Spaceballs , "ludicrous speed" was an insanely high velocity at which the starship  Spaceball 1  could travel.  Today at work, our internet connection is moving at ludicrous speed, but it isn't because it's moving fast.  Quite the contrary:  it's painfully slow.  Trying to do anything online has been an exercise in frustration.  There is light at the end of this tunnel however.  Our company is moving from a shared dial-up connection to IDSL.  It won't be high-speed access, but it should be a significant improvement from what we have now.  That will make everything so much easier.  Our IT staff (consisting of one person, who also happens to be our head engineer) tells me our new connection should be live by Wednesday of this week.  I have an awful feeling that he may have overestimated how quickly it will happen, but I'm at least mildly comforted to know that modern technology (sort of) is on its way.  Our internet problems rate as a minor inconvenience, though.  I had a good weekend, so it would take something far more significant to really bother me today.  Tomorrow may be another story, though, if these problems continue to wear on my nerves.  I drove to Brandi's apartment in Stow on Friday after work.  It was a nice drive, now that it's far enough into spring that the sun is up for the whole drive.  When it's light out, the Ohio Turnpike actually does offer some decent scenery.  I listened to the Reds game for much of the drive, and there are few better companions on a solitary drive than announcers Marty Brennamen and Joe Nuxhall.  While I'm talking about this, I want to give a shout out to the radio station 700 (AM) WLW out of Cincinnati.  I have a hard time getting some Toledo radio stations in Bowling Green, but WLW has an incredible signal, and it was clear as a bell from Toledo almost all the way to Cleveland, when I switched to my CD player because the game was over.  I'm really happy about this, because that's mostly Indians country, and I doubt there are any local stations carrying the Reds.  I got to Brandi's place a little after 7:00, and we went to Red Lobster for dinner.  I personally cannot stomach most seafood (and can't bear to even look at some of it), but Brandi likes it, so I took her there.  They cater to non-surf people with a few token turf items on the menu, so I chose from those.  It was pretty good, too.  After dinner, we headed back to her place.  We had a pretty hectic time last weekend, so we mostly just wanted to chill out and relax this weekend.  We definitely did that, starting on Friday night.  We put in a movie and promptly fell asleep on the living room floor.  We slept there for quite a while before eventually moving into the bedroom and continuing our slumber.  On Saturday, Brandi got up to take a bike ride while I stayed home.  I had brought my PlayStation, so I played my new basketball game while she was gone.  As it was quite a nice weekend, Brandi went out to lay in the sun when she got home, and I sat outside with her.  We went to get ice cream after that, and then back home for more PlayStation.  That evening we went to BW3 in Garfield Heights.  Brandi had planned a get-together there with some of her co-workers.  Unfortunately, none of them showed up, but she and I still had a good time.  The BW3 there is really cool.  It doesn't have the atmosphere of the ones in BG or Kent, both college towns, but the restaurant itself was nice.  It was really big, and there was plenty of space between tables.  In the ones at BG and Kent, it gets pretty crowded, but that was definitely not a problem at this place.  We ate there and had a few drinks, then played a few games of pool before heading home.  Sunday, as is our custom, was even more of a do-nothing day.  Brandi again went out to lay in the sun.  I went out with her for a few minutes, then came back in to be with my PlayStation.  We went to the store when she came back in, so we could get a few things for dinner that night.  We had lunch when we got back, then napped for a while.  Brandi got up before I did and started making dinner.  When I got up, we played PlayStation together until dinner was ready.  She made roasted chicken and fettucine alfredo, and it was awesome.  We went for a walk after dinner, to enjoy the nice weather of the weekend as it wound down.  We walked about three miles, and my feet are still a little sore even now.  It was pretty muggy out, and we were both really warm by the time we got home.  She ended up firing up her air conditioner, which was very nice.  We watched a movie and ate ice cream while we wound down, and then went to bed.  All in all, I think we relaxed enough this weekend that it'll take at least a day or two for my screwed-up sleep cycle to bring me down again.

       urlLink The Ultimate Harry Potter Site   I don't really try to hide the fact that I'm a pretty serious geek about some things.  This is one of them.  Yeah, they're kids' books/movies, but dammit, I like 'em.  Anyway, I found this site today, and it's pretty cool.  Highly extensive, too--I haven't had time to explore very much of it yet (especially since, um...I'm at work).

       urlLink Broadcaster Slams 'Nightline'   urlLink McCain rebukes Sinclair 'Nightline' decision   Can someone please tell me how this "'trivializes the deaths of our brave servicemen and women'"?  What utter nonsense.  Putting a name and a face with each fallen soldier makes it personal.  It brings it home to people who read the headlines and go on with their lives.  Perish the thought that the general public should be able to see the faces of these soldiers and realize that they're actual people and not just statistics.  In other, entirely unrelated news, I just read that truckers in Southern California are intentionally clogging up traffic to protest high gas prices.  I can't really say I agree with their methods, but at least someone is making a statement.

        Who am I to disagree?    I don't know why this just occurred to me, out of the blue, but I thought it was interesting enough to share.  For the first time in a while, I actually remember part of a dream I had last night.  I dreamed that I was at work, and I had to go down to the engineering department for one reason or another.  When I got down there, I discovered the engineers giving a slide show to a potential customer, showing plans to convert our facility into a crystal meth lab.  Even as slow as business has been lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.

      I started this blog on January 28, three months ago yesterday.  That's a fairly significant portion of time, at least for my own generally limited attention span.  As such, I thought this was as good a time as any to talk a little bit about the blog itself, what I've done with it so far and where I plan to go with it from here.  Don't worry; I'm not going to do this  every  three months or anything.  I was a little apprehensive about starting a blog.  I've had personal webpages before, and after the fun wears off (usually as soon as they're functional), I generally forget about them and never update them again.  I didn't want to start this if I wasn't going to follow through with it.  The problem was that I had no way of knowing in advance if this was something I would keep doing or not.  I thought it would be, but I feel that way every time I start a personal project.  Sometimes it works; most often it doesn't.  Obviously, I eventually decided to go ahead with it.  I love to write, and I had plenty of stuff on my mind that I thought would make fine subject material for several entries at least.  I still wasn't sure if it was something I would keep up with or not, but I figured even if I didn't post often, it would be here when I needed or wanted it.  It was never my intention to make sure I wrote something in here each day (at least through the week).  That's just something that happened.  Each day that I've been at work, from January 28 until now, I've put at least something in here.  I'm proud of that.  I love the fact that I've found something each day that was worth commenting on, or at least making note of.  Still, I'm not keeping that as a hard and fast rule.  If eventually there comes a day when I have nothing to say, so be it.  At this point, though, it's become almost a point of pride to write every day, so hopefully it will continue.  I've checked out many blogs written by other people, and I've seen that many of them have a theme.  Not this one.  I've thought about it, but what's the point?  I have too many interests (call them "obsessions" if you will; I prefer "passions") to write about just one.  After all, I'm doing this mostly for my own amusement.  A lot of the time, it's about sports.  Sometimes it's a "How I Spent My Summer Vacation" type thing.  There are a few rants sprinkled in, or simple observations and memories.  Occasionally I just post a link to something I've read.  There's more where all of this came from, believe me.  Some days I write more or less than others, and that's fine.  I just play it by ear.  I have to say, I'm having a blast with this.  I love just logging on and writing about whatever strikes my fancy, or being able to post a link and write my thoughts about something I've seen online.  Often I've discovered that I have more to say on certain subjects than I thought I did.  I can't see how that would be a bad thing.  There are still some things I want to do or try with this blog that I haven't done yet, or at least haven't done very much.  There will be some reviews forthcoming, of books, movies, music, etc.  I may do some running journals, while I watch movies or sports (I have a feeling these entries may turn into a one-man version of  Mystery Science Theater 3000 , which will be fun).  Who knows?  I may even throw in some fictional vignettes (I write a  killer  character sketch) or lame poetry.  The possibilities are endless.  In terms of functionality, I'll continue to tweak the template.  I chose this Blogger template originally just because I liked the color scheme (BGSU Falcons fo' life!), and I've made a few minor cosmetic changes to it.  Those changes will continue as options present themselves and as I learn more about the coding, just so I can get to a point where my blog is no longer totally based on a cookie-cutter template which makes it look exactly like so many others.  I'm planning on making at least one expansion as well.  Sometime in the hopefully not-too-distant future, look for the "What I'm Reading Now" area to be replaced with a link to a separate "Jon's Reading Page" or something like that.  This future page, as I'm picturing it, will continue to show what books I'm working my way through at that particular moment.  I also want to keep a log of books I've read in a particular year, just to satisfy my own curiosity.  This page will also feature a list of reading recommendations--books I've read that I really enjoyed and think other people would like as well.  Once I get this reading page up and running, I may do something similar for movies.  So, for anyone who reads on a regular basis, thanks for stopping by.  Pass on the link if you enjoy it--I do this for myself, but every writer wants an audience, and I would  love  for this page to be more widely visited.  Look for things to keep getting better, and as always, if you have any comments or questions, please post them or send me an e-mail--links are at the bottom of each post.

      Brandi got another phone call yesterday, this one from a YMCA in Toledo which is also interested in her services.  She's pretty stoked about that, as she could just transfer in there from the YMCA at which she currently works.  Hopefully in a couple of weeks we can start figuring out when and how she's going to move back to BG, because it definitely sounds like that day is coming.

      I talked to Brandi today on my lunch break.  It sounds like a health club in Toledo is ready to offer her a position.  It would be only part-time to start, but advancement could happen rapidly after that.  She's going over there next Friday to iron out some details.  If all goes well, she could be back in BG sometime in early June.  That would be outstanding.

       urlLink Harvard Gazette: File sharing may boost CD sales   It's almost astounding in its simplicity, but someone actually decided to sit down and look at some data.  Surprise!  The results are in direct contradiction to what record industry experts have been saying for years.  This study shows that there is  absolutely no evidence  to support the claims that file sharing is hurting CD sales, and in some instances it may in fact be  helping  it.  I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a music pirate.  I've been doing it for years, and I feel no guilt whatsoever.  Technically it's not legal, but that's something of a formality in my mind.  I never felt I was hurting the artist by doing it, because I have certain personal guidelines about what and how much I download.  This study shows that a lot of people share similar guidelines, and that what the recording industry has been spewing is generally a load of crap.  I've suspected that the whole time; now there's empirical proof.  I can see how the recording industry came to its conclusion.  CD sales is a multimillion dollar industry.  All of a sudden a lot of its wares were available for free, and it stands to reason that this would hurt sales.  When actual sales numbers started dropping, it's a fairly reasonable assumption, on the surface, that piracy is hurting the industry.  When you take into account all the factors involved, though, their arguments don't quite hold up.  As I said, I have certain rules I use to guide my downloading habits.  I never download entire albums.  If I want several different songs from the same album, I just buy the CD.  After all, if I like that many songs from it, chances are good that I'll like the whole thing.  Basically, what it boils down to is this:  any song I download and keep, I was never going to buy it anyway.  It just doesn't make sense to pay $15 for a CD that only has one or two good songs on it.  So the record industry isn't losing any money on this type of downloading, because they weren't going to make that money anyway.  In fact, I can easily believe that file sharing is good for the record industry, if other people use file sharing the same way I do.  If I hear someone talking about an artist they like, I can easily check them out.  I download a song or two to see if I like them, I either keep them or move into CD-buying mode.  It's that simple.  I can't even tell you how many artists I've discovered this way, but it's quite a few.  Of course, the recording industry is blowing off this study, and going on with their pointless lawsuits.  Sales are down, and they need a scapegoat, dammit!  Never mind the fact that the economy in general is down right now, or that a lot of the music that's coming out right now is just plain awful.  ("Shake It Like a Polaroid Picture"?  Really?  That might be the most inane lyric I've ever heard.)  And it doesn't matter that so many of the radio stations in the U.S. are owned by a single huge conglomerate which limits their stations' playlists, which means most listeners have a very narrow exposure to different artists or types of music.  Never mind these things.  Obviously, CD sales are down because  Americans are thieves!   I'll let you in on a secret, too.  The record industry can talk all it wants about how stamping out piracy is all about protecting the artists, but it just isn't true.  Only the biggest bands get record deals that allow them to make any royalties from album sales.  For everyone else, the only money they see from the record deal is the advance.  The record industry is looking out for number one.  I have no problem with that--they have as much right as anyone to make a profit.  It just irritates me that they try to sound altruistic, like they're trying to protect the bands.  They're not.  I think things are moving in the right direction with the establishment of online music services which allow you to purchase whole albums  or  individual songs digitally.  It's a nice start.  I don't belong to any of those services, though, because right now none of them appeal to me.  At this point, they offer files in proprietary formats that you don't have complete freedom over once you purchase them.  I don't want that.  I want a service which offers a wide variety of songs in regular MP3 format, which I can use however I please once I buy it.  I want the freedom to keep it in that format, or burn it to an audio CD, or share with a friend who might like it.  After all, it's mine, right?  I paid for it; I should be able to use it how I choose.

      Yet another clever name for a blog entry of random notes.  * I got a phone call yesterday afternoon from my long-lost friend Jessica.  She wanted to tell me that she's now engaged to her boyfriend Matt, who she's been seeing for quite a while.  Jess is one of my oldest and best friends, and I'm very happy for her.  Our friendship goes back eleven years, to Mr. Rieck's American History class during our junior year at Troy High School.  Congratulations, Jess.  * There's really no appropriate segue from that to this, but I  finally  got to see the Reds play last night.  Their game was televised on Fox Sports Ohio on a night when the Indians didn't have a game.  I'm happy to report that the Reds beat the Pirates 5-2, led by two of my favorite players:  Sean Casey (2-run homer) and Adam Dunn (2-run double).  I even managed to resist the seduction of my couch, staying awake through the whole thing.  I had to take advantage of the opportunity to watch them play, since I don't know when it'll happen again.  They're fun to watch.  * I was planning to keep a running journal during the game and post it here, but alas, I think my laptop has finally given up the ghost after four years of hard use.  It was having issues anyway.  The battery wouldn't hold a charge, the touchpad buttons no longer worked, and the screen had a tendency to tip over if you tried to open it too far.  Now it won't even accept power from the AC adapter without a lot of help.  I'm thinking about taking it in and having it worked on (the battery and power cord can be replaced, if needs be), but I wonder if it's worth the investment.  I'd eventually like a new one anyway, with more functionality.  I suppose if I could get it done fairly cheap I'd do it, just to have one to use in the meantime.  * I was reading  urlLink this story  in the Toledo Blade this morning.  It deals with the investigation of some possible Satanistic rituals in the area, and I saw one minor thing in it that kind of irritated me.  They refer to one man quoted in the article as "a self-proclaimed wiccan".  I'm just wondering, who else would proclaim him as such?  Of course it's self-proclaimed; that's how religion works.  I don't know if the author of the article used this wording to downplay the validity of the man's religion or not, but that's how it came across to me.  That's highly irritating to me.  Wicca may not be nearly as widespread as other religions, but that doesn't make it any more or less valid, or deserving of any less respect.  * Some BGSU football fans, many of whom also happen to be Cleveland Browns fans, are already forsaking departing Falcons Josh Harris and Janssen Patton, who are joining the NFL with the Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively.  I understand that both teams are big rivals of the Browns, but I think it's sad that these fans can turn so quickly on players that did so much for our program.  It's not as though BG has all that many former players in the NFL.  Personally, I'm a Bengals fan, and they're also in the same division (with Cleveland) as Baltimore and Pittsburgh, but I'm still going to root for my fellow BGSU alumni to do well.  I do understand the rivalry factor, but come on.  * It's good to be king (or, at least, Purchasing Manager).  Through one of our company's vendors, I just scored tickets to Saturday's NHL playoff game in Detroit, the Red Wings vs. the Calgary Flames.  That should be a lot of fun.  I'm not the world's biggest hockey fan, by any means, but the games are awesome in person.

       urlLink Ravens pick BG's Harris   urlLink Steel City a fit for 'Big Ben'   urlLink Anderson Buffalo-bound   The draft has been hashed and re-hashed endlessly for the past week (including by yours truly), so I just want to hit some highlights and then be done with it.  Until next year.  I'm glad this whole mess with Eli Manning was finally resolved.  I couldn't believe the Chargers went ahead and drafted him, but it made sense when they traded him to the Giants for Philip Rivers and some other draft picks.  I continue to think that both teams got hosed on this deal.  Manning may turn out to be a decent quarterback, but I don't think he'll ever reach the level of his brother Peyton.  As for San Diego, they already have a weak-armed quarterback in Drew Brees.  With so many other needs, I don't think they needed to get another in Philip Rivers.  I don't see him as that great of an upgrade over Brees, and they're going to be paying him a lot more money as a high draft pick.  I think Robert Gallery (who went to the Raiders) would have been a better selection.  At least by going this way they got some extra draft picks to address some of their other needs.  I have to give major props to the Detroit Lions, who had a great draft and addressed some major needs for their team.  I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing that much of the credit for this draft should go to head coach Steve Mariucci.  General manager Matt Millen hasn't been too impressive in the realm of talent evaluation, nor too savvy in general, and I don't know why that would have changed just in time for this draft.  Not only did they do a great job of addressing needs, they also managed to fleece the hapless Browns out of their second-round pick, which Detroit then used to trade up and get another first-round pick, which they used on halfback Kevin Jones.  Personally, I think Jones will turn out to be the class of this draft when it comes to running backs.  Head coach Butch Davis was in charge of the draft for the Browns, and Butch is a moron.  This makes me chuckle gleefully, as he continues to run that hated franchise into the ground.  It'll take the Browns years to recover once they discover their mistake and attempt to replace him.  Ben Roethlisberger rightfully should have gone higher in the draft, and was somewhat screwed over by the Manning situation.  However, I think he fell into a great situation in Pittsburgh.  He can play behind Tommie Maddox and learn for a year and then step into the starting role.  The Steelers have got some great receivers to throw to, and they always have a good offensive line.  Also, Bill Cowher is a very good NFL coach.  I wasn't thrilled with Cincinnati's selection of Chris Perry in the first round.  I'm going to give Coach Lewis the benefit of the doubt on this one and see how it plays out, but I'm a little concerned.  I'm not sold on Chris Perry's pro potential, nor on the Bengals' need for a running back.  If they were intent on taking one, I think Kevin Jones would have been a better choice.  At least he would have been a contrast to incumbent starter Rudi Johnson.  Johnson is a power back, as is Perry.  Jones is more of a speedster.  This raises questions about Johnson's future in Cincy, even though he showed last year that he can be a good one.  The real winners of the draft were the Baltimore Ravens, who picked up BGSU quarterback Josh Harris in the sixth round.  I still think Josh is going to be a very good NFL QB in a few years.  I don't know if Baltimore is the ideal situation for him to grow in, but it could be.  They don't have a veteran quarterback for him to learn from.  They do have two quarterbacks on their roster who are very much unproven, one of which could easily be labeled a "journeyman."  That might give Josh a chance to play earlier than anticipated, but I'm not sure that would be the best thing for his growth and long-term potential.  As a sidenote, I give a big thumbs-down to Ohio State's Craig Krenzel getting drafted, especially in the fifth round.  Have these folks  ever  seen Krenzel play?  He's a heck of a leader, but otherwise not that great as a quarterback, and he doesn't strike me as someone who's going to get much better with coaching.  You can feed me a Wilson if he ends up having a better pro career than Josh Harris.

      Brandi often tells me that reading my blog makes her feel like our entire existence together revolves around eating and sleeping.  I'm happy to say that rarely has that been more true than this weekend just past.  We didn't have any specific plans, and it seemed that neither one of us really felt like venturing out and doing anything, so we didn't.  As per usual, I got to Stow around 7:00 on Friday.  We decided on Mexican food, so we went to a place called El Campesino.  That was a great choice.  We didn't have to wait for a table at all, and they brought chips and salsa right away.  I think that's the best part of eating at a Mexican restaurant.  It was a little loud in there, but it had a good atmosphere.  The waiters were joking around with people, and it was fun.  The food was awesome, too.  After dinner we went to Wal-Mart to pick up a few things, and then went back to Brandi's place to do nothing.  We just hung out that night.  I think all we did after we got home was play a couple games of Scrabble before turning in.  Saturday was much the same.  We got up relatively early (10:30 or so, I think, which is early for a weekend) and just hung around the apartment for a while.  As noon approached, we headed over to Pizza Hut for lunch.  We went from there to Target, where Brandi wanted to get a few things, and from there to Jiffy Lube so she could get an oil change.  There they found a couple of other issues on her car that needed to be addressed, so it's good that she decided to get her oil changed.  After that we headed back to her place to hang out and listen to the NFL draft on the radio, since she doesn't have cable at her place.  There is an ESPN Radio affiliate in Cleveland, as well as a Fox Sports Radio affiliate.  I was hoping to get ESPN's coverage, since Mike and Mike were doing it, but no such luck.  They had some local yahoos talking almost exclusively about the Browns.  I guess that's to be expected, in a local NFL market, but their coverage sucked.  They talked almost exclusively about the Browns, to the exclusion of even telling everyone what the other picks were.  That's all I cared about.  I don't care about the Browns at all; I just wanted to know who was going where.  This was made even more boring by the fact that the Browns only had one significant draft pick, so they had to talk about that the whole time.  I liked the Fox Sports coverage, which was more the overall coverage I was looking for, but unfortunately they were pre-empted by a baseball game for several hours.  Anyway, listening to the horrible draft coverage eventually lulled both of us to sleep on the living room floor.  When we woke up, we thought briefly about heading out for a few drinks.  Neither of us really felt like interrupting our lazy weekend, though, so instead we decided to go get some movies and grab some fast food.  We rented a couple of DVDs and drove through Wendy's (mmm, Wendy's) on the way home.  We watched one movie as we ate, then put on an old standby (a movie we own) afterwards.  As per usual, we fell asleep on the floor and woke up later to actually go to bed.  Sunday was a serious do-nothing day.  We got up and went to the grocery store to get the stuff for Brandi to make dinner that night.  We came home and ate leftover pizza and kept checking the internet (via my cell phone) for updates on the draft, since radio coverage sucked once again.  We were kinda doing our own thing--I was playing PlayStation, and Brandi wandered into her room to watch a movie.  Eventually I joined her, and predictably, we ended up napping.  I'm not sure exactly how long we slept, but it was a while.  When we got up, Brandi started making dinner, with me pitching in occasionally where I could.  She made lasagna, which turned out to be quite awesome.  We also had salad (with Italian dressing from Olive Garden) and garlic bread.  Good stuff.  After dinner we went for a walk.  The temperature outside was great, but our walk ended up being aborted early by rain.  It didn't rain hard or long, but we didn't want to take too many chances.  We got home and dried off a bit, then watched the second movie we rented on Saturday.  It was  Saving Silverman , which was extremely strange but pretty funny.  After that we turned in for the night.  Now I'm here, back at work on a Monday morning, and strangely feeling still tired even after all the sleeping we did over the weekend.  I guess I'll have to get in yet another nap this afternoon.

       The weather in Ohio is notoriously inconsistent, but this is getting ridiculous.  Yesterday it was sunny and 86°.  Now it's raining and 60°.  If it was a simple progression, that would be fine, but it wasn't.  It was hot all day yesterday, then clouded up and stormed some last night.  Then it cleared up.  Then it stormed again early this morning.  Then it cleared up and was gorgeous and sunny for a while.  Then it got really dark and stormed again.  Now it's just cloudy and rainy.  It's supposed to clear up again this evening, and then storm again overnight.  It's supposed to rain on and off all weekend.  This makes me even more glad that I took advantage of Wednesday's awesome weather.   After some searching, I've finally found the channel on which Time Warner Cable in Bowling Green is showing Reds games that are televised on Fox Sports Ohio, even when they're pre-empted locally by Cleveland Indians games.  This means I'll get to see a fair number of Reds games this season after all.  This makes me happy.  Unfortunately, as is my habit, I fell asleep on the couch in front of last night's game.  This means I missed Ken Griffey Jr.'s return to form.  I'm glad to hear about it, though, even if I didn't actually see it.  We need Junior to stay healthy this year and do the things he's capable of doing.   Other than baseball, what a crappy time of year this is for sports.  I've tried to get into the NBA and NHL playoffs, but I just can't do it.  Unfortunately, that stuff is dominating sports coverage due to its "importance."  I'm ready for these sports to be over so ESPN can focus on baseball.  Of course, then they'll probably ramp up coverage of golf and NASCAR, which are even worse.   I don't attend nearly as many sporting events through the summer as I do the rest of the year.  There's plenty of other cool stuff to look forward to in the coming weeks and months, though.  The new Stephen King book,  Song of Susannah , comes out on June 8.  Edwin McCain's new CD,  Scream and Whisper , comes out on June 22 (also Brandi's birthday), and hopefully he'll be playing a show or two in the area.  I have tickets for Brandi and I to go see the Reds on June 12 when they play in Cleveland, and I'd like to get down to a game or two in Cincy.  There are plenty of cool movies coming out this summer as well.  I'm a bit of a movie buff, but I probably won't get to the theater to see each one I'm interested in.  Oh well, that's what DVD players are for.  The one I'm most anticipating is  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which comes out on June 4.   Troy  comes out today, and it looks pretty cool.  I also want to see  Shrek 2  (May 21),  The Day After Tomorrow  (May 28),  Garfield  (June 11),  Spider-Man 2  (June 30), and  Anchorman  (July 9).  I'm sure there will be more.   Speaking of Harry Potter...I know I've linked  urlLink this site  before, but I wanted to mention it again.  Not having much to do this morning, I was perusing this site and some of the essays people have written.  I'm amazed at how much analytical though has gone into some of them.  I think it's awesome.  I have a tendency to geek out on stuff sometimes, and it's good to know I'm not the only one.   Okay, so  Friends  is over now.  I wasn't a regular viewer by any means, but I've seen my share of episodes and was mildly amused by them.  Anyway, not many sitcoms have this kind of staying power, so I'm a little sad to see it go.  On the other hand, I don't generally watch television that doesn't involve some sort of athletic competition, so what do I care?  Why am I even writing about this?  I don't know.  If you're looking for a sitcom to watch, check out  That 70s Show .  Now  that  is quality television.   For my latest video game fix, I'm thinking of picking up  Star Wars:  Knights of the Old Republic .  It looks really cool.  I've been playing sports games almost exclusively for a while, so it'll be nice to plunge into a role-playing game, particularly a  Star Wars  game.  In the back of my mind I'm still interested in  Galaxies , the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, but I doubt my life would be the same if I got into it.  Also, I really don't have any spare funds right now for a game subscription.   Sounds like we're all set to lay off some more guys this afternoon.  Shop guys, of course, unless someone isn't telling me something, which is possible.  Current plans call for laid-off employees to be called back to work on June 7.  I'll believe it when I see it.  We have no business right now, and our "sales staff" doesn't seem up to the job.  If things get worse, I just hope the owner decides to sell instead of just folding the company, even if I'm not here at that point.  There's potential here, but right now there's no leadership.

      Those of you who read this blog on a regular basis (both of you) will notice that there were no entries made yesterday.  That's because I blew off work yesterday.  I have no regrets.  I did absolutely nothing, and it was everything I thought it could be.  That one is for any  Office Space  aficianados who may be lurking.  In truth, there was a little bit more to it than that...but not much.  The whole thing started with Brandi coming into Bowling Green on Tuesday night.  She was scheduled for an interview in BG on Wednesday afternoon, so she drove over to my place when she got off work on Tuesday.  She had much of the day free on Wednesday, so I decided to burn a vacation day and take it off with her.  It was a perfect,  Ferris Bueller -esque kind of day for it.  You know..."How could I possibly be expected to handle school on a day like this?"  In my case, being at the ripe old age of 26 and out of college for going on four years now, it was work rather than school, but the general concept was the same.  I saw no point in coming to work and sitting here with nothing to do while behind me a large window looked out on a perfectly beautiful day that I would be unable to enjoy.  So I stayed home, and I'm so glad I did.  Brandi and I slept in until 11:00 with the window open so we could enjoy the breeze.  She decided to skip her interview (which was for a part time position she wasn't all that interested in anyway), so we had the whole afternoon together.  We had Chinese food for lunch, then ran around town a little bit, culminating in a trip to the local Dairy Queen.  We took our overflowing ice cream cones to the picnic bench outside and basked in the sun, watching traffic, road construction workers, and people flowing in and out of the rental management office across the street.  We hung out for a bit after that, and Brandi had to leave at 4:00 to be at work.  I played some PlayStation basketball after she left (in front of the windows, of course), and then drove to Stow to join her for the evening after she got off work.  We had a nice, relaxing evening, eating pizza and watching a movie.  Then we went to bed, and I got up early this morning and came to work.  I do this from time to time, and it's always nice to have a day off in the middle of a week.  It helps me to recharge.  The daily routine really wears on me after a while, because I  hate  being on a schedule.  I hate it passionately.  I prefer flexibility (although not unpredictability) in my day-to-day life.  I can handle being on a schedule, but I don't like it.  Sometimes I have to take a day to break out.  If I ever find myself in a situation where I'm in charge of this sort of thing, my first option would be to let everyone work flex-time.  Choose your own hours, as long as everything gets done by when it needs to be done and your hours come out to forty.  I had a limited form of flex-time in a previous job, and I liked it a whole lot.  If I needed to get off early one night for one sporting event or another, no problem--I just made up the time on some other day.  That was great for me personally, but I realize that setup isn't optimal for all businesses and work environments.  Therefore, my second option would be to offer each employee one "discretionary day" per month.  It's a simple concept:  you get one day off to use per month, use it or lose it.  Preferably these days would be scheduled in advance (like vacation days) to avoid conflicts, but if you just get up one morning and decide it's too nice of a day to come in, so be it.  I need days like that from time to time, and I suspect I'm not the only one.  I think even a lot of people who don't acknowledge that they  need  an unscheduled break from time to time would benefit greatly from  having  one.  This is why I'll never be in charge of anyone.  Any business that made the mistake of putting me in a position of power would be doomed to fail miserably.  For the most part, I think that's because I don't exactly have a traditional view of jobs and careers.  There is almost no job that I will ever hold that will be part of how I define myself.  It seems to me that a lot of people make having a certain career one of their life's goals, and/or become absorbed in it once they get there.  Not me.  I've never had a job that I've spared much more than a passing thought for when I wasn't actually there doing it.  For me, a job is just something I do so that I can do other things.  Only this and nothing more.  To close, I'll defer again to  Office Space  and the great sage, Peter Gibbons:  "We don't have a lot of time on this earth!  We weren't meant to spend it this way.  Human beings were not meant to sit in little cubicles staring at computer screens all day...filling out useless forms...and listening to eight different bosses drone on about mission statements."    "I told those fudge-packers that I liked Michael Bolton's music." "Oh, that is not right, Michael."

      Despite our lack of business and actual work to do, my place of employment has been a bastion of excitement so far this week.  Our facility is located just down the road from Toledo Express Airport, and the window in my office looks out in that general direction.  It so happens that our fearless leader, President Bush, was in town this morning.  He flew into Toledo Express around 9:00.  Needless to say, my office was a pretty popular place at that time, as my co-workers gathered at the window, hoping for a glimpse of Air Force One as it landed, or of the presidential motorcade if it happened to pass by.  Although I'm not a fan of our current president by any means, I joined my co-workers at the window for a short time.  A chance to see this sort of thing doesn't come up very often.  Mostly I was just interested to see some of the peripheral events.  A co-worker insisted they would close off the road in front of our building, and I wanted to see them accomplish that.  Also, there was a helicopter circling above the woods across the street from our facility, which I thought was interesting.  Alas, I missed the landing of Air Force One, and the motorcade didn't pass by here.  How sad.  The whole thing certainly stirred everyone up around here, though.  On a sidenote:  before President Bush landed, we had clear, sunny skies here in Toledo.  Around the time he landed, the skies clouded over.  Around 10:15, as Mr. Bush was taking off again, the skies cleared up.  No political commentary here, just simple fact.  It's interesting that Mr. Bush was in the area today, ostensibly bringing the message that the economy is improving.  Let's just say that we here in Toledo have yet to see this improvement.  Far from it.  On Friday of last week, three individuals were laid off from their jobs here.  Although they were let go on Friday, they came in on Monday to collect their personal items.  One of them was caught trying to smuggle company equipment out in his toolbox.  That's always fun.  Of course, all three guys let go were shop workers.  The office staff seems strangely immune to being laid off.  Being one of them, I'm selfishly grateful for this, but at the same time I have to wonder about it.  We now have seven guys working in our shop, seven people in the office, and our production manager doing a bit of both.  I have a hard time understanding how seven workers can require eight administrators.  Then again, maybe I should deduct two from my count of office personnel, since our company president and marketing director (the president's fiancee) are here only sporadically.  Strangely enough, they seem to come in late, take long lunches, and leave early.  Sometimes they don't show up at all.  That doesn't seem like a good business practice, especially considering the fact that they're also our main sales staff.  Some customers have been getting irate lately after calling several times and being unable to reach anyone in our sales department.  I think it's logical to assume that we're losing potential orders, and it's not too difficult to see why we don't have any business right now and why people are being laid off.  To that end, our head engineer has also started taking sales calls, against our president's wishes.  Someone has to sell stuff if this company is going to survive.  Interestingly, our head engineer is also our entire IT department.  That seems to be the underlying theory behind this company's hiring practices:  overspread and underpay.  I say that as someone who is also currently filling two positions.  In short, I'd say this company's leadership is none too capable.  Much like the U.S. in general, come to think of it.  Yes indeed, it was fitting that President Bush was around today.  It's too bad he couldn't have met up with our company's president.  Maybe they could have played the fiddle together.  I don't know if they've noticed or not, but Rome is burning.  Also, gas prices around the area went up another twenty cents today in honor of Mr. Bush's visit.  Thank you, sir; please come again.  Come to think of it, I should practice saying that last sentence.  If Bush is placed in charge of the economy for another four years, it may become part of my career.  Don't laugh:  it could happen to you, too.  Would you like fries with that?

      Occasionally there are weekends that don't feel 100% like weekends because there's so much going on.  Sure, I'm not at work, but I'm on the go and don't have much downtime, and when I get back to work on Monday, I'm like "What the hell just happened?"  This isn't a bad thing, by any means, just different.  I'm not a high-energy person who's always busy, so weekends like this are somewhat rare.  Brandi and I got into Bowling Green around the same time on Friday.  I was coming home from work, and she was coming from her hometown of Clyde, which is about 45 minutes east.  We hung out for a little bit (watching  That 70s Show ) and then went out for dinner at Easystreet Cafe in downtown BG.  We had to wait a little bit for a table, so we went upstairs into their bar area to have a drink and play a game of pool.  We got seated for dinner not too long after that, and it was great.  The food was awesome, as usual, and the service was good as well.  After dinner we just headed back to my apartment.  We thought briefly about going out for a while, but we were both pretty tired, so we didn't bother.  We sat on my couch and watched Animal Planet.  We're both big fans of that  Funniest Animal Home Videos  show, or whatever it's called.  We ended up falling asleep in front of an episode of that.  We got up relatively early on Saturday--about 10:45, which is early when you consider that neither of us was really ready to get up at that point.  We had tickets for the Red Wings' playoff game in Detroit.  The game was scheduled to start at 3:00, and due to a terrible previous traffic experience for a sporting event in Detroit (the Motor City Bowl at Ford Field this past December), I wanted to leave plenty early.  We were able to take our time getting ready, and we got on the road about 12:15.  That turned out to be almost perfect timing.  The streets in Detroit...well, they leave something to be desired.  If nothing else, the signage wasn't very good, and it was by pure luck that we managed to find Joe Louis Arena on our first try.  We found convenient parking for only $4 and got into the arena around 2:00.  The game experience was a lot of fun.  Hockey is huge in Detroit, and that arena was loud.  I like that a lot.  There was a little bit of fighting, and Detroit's Steve Yzerman got whacked in the face with a puck and had to be helped off the ice.  Unfortunately, the Wings lost, and didn't even score.  The game was a lot of fun, though.  I think we may have turned Brandi into a big hockey fan--she can't wait to go see another game.  Getting out of Detroit after the game was interesting, due mainly to traffic and the driving habits of others.  We made it, though.  On the way back, we decided to stop at a Mexican place in Toledo (Loma Linda) for dinner.  When we got there, though, the place was packed.  I couldn't even find the person we needed to see to get our name in for a table.  We were both hungry, so we didn't want to wait.  We went back to Bowling Green and ate at a Mexican place there (El Zarape) instead.  The food there was pretty good, if not quite as good as the Mexican food we had last week.  After dinner, we stopped in at the grocery store to pick up a few things, then headed back to my place.  We watched  Zoolander  on DVD and ended up falling asleep before it was over.  Luckily for us, we've already seen it a bunch of times.  On Sunday we did get to sleep in.  We got up around 12:30.  Of course, neither of us really felt like getting up even then, but we had some stuff we needed to get done.  Our first item of business was to find the YMCA in Toledo that expressed interest in hiring Brandi, so she could fill out an application and all that.  Getting there was something of an ordeal, due to a stopped train blocking one of the roads we were on, but eventually we got there.  Brandi went in to fill out her application and take a tour (she liked it a lot and it sounds pretty promising, by the way) while I stayed out in the car and listened to the Reds game on the radio.  From there we went to the Franklin Park Mall in Toledo.  Brandi wanted to get a Mother's Day gift, and I was thinking of looking for a new cell phone.  Also while we were there, we went in several different jewelry stores to look at engagement rings.  Now, I'm not saying I  am  or  am not  planning to buy one of these beasts anytime soon, but browsing them (and conversing with jewelry store employees) was highly educational.  It was an interesting experience, and it made Brandi almost maniacally happy, so it was all worth it.  It was around 5:30 when we finished at the mall, and I was extremely hungry, having not eaten all day.  Due to an accident on the interstate, getting somewhere to get food was something of an ordeal as well.  We had to guess our way around Toledo, which we managed quite nicely, if I do say so myself.  I felt a lot better once we got something to eat--I had been starting to zone out and get random, which happens from time to time.  We got to relax a little bit once we got home.  We watched  The Simpsons , and then I played some PlayStation basketball while Brandi played  The Sims .  Then we went for a walk on campus, which was really nice.  I went to school at BGSU for three years, and I've been out of school for four years, and I still love being on campus.  After our walk, we watched an episode of a show called  Curb Your Enthusiasm , which Brandi borrowed on DVD from a co-worker.  It was pretty funny.  We only got to watch one episode, but I've still got the DVD, so I'll probably try out a couple more of them.  Now I'm back at work, thinking "Where in the hell did the weekend go?"  Of course, today has been a story unto itself.  We'll save that for a little bit later, though.

       Beach Music , by Pat Conroy, was the lunchtime book I just finished.  It's 799 pretty dense pages, and even being a fast reader, knocking it out in 45-minute-per-day intervals took quite a while.  As such, it's definitely going to merit a re-read under different circumstances so I can get through it more quickly and get a better feel for it.  Despite some pretty serious flaws, I enjoyed the book for the most part.  However, I think the ending may have killed it for me.  The vast majority of the book is spent building up and fleshing out these great and seemingly irreconcilable tensions between characters.  At the end, though, everyone sits down together, and most of the problems get worked out in the space of just a few pages.  What bothered me the most was when the book's strongest and most intriguing character, Jordan Elliott, suddenly caved in, renounced some of his strongest beliefs, and forgave his father for years of abuse, and the two of them became good friends.  Even before that, there were plenty of things about this book that bothered me.  The first thing I noticed was the dialogue.  I have an ear for good dialogue, and there were parts of this book where it was just painful to read.  People don't talk this way.  It wasn't bad all the way through, but it definitely had its moments.  There was a lot of character inconsistency.  Jordan's forgiveness of his father was the biggest example, but there were plenty of other examples.  Most of it dealt with the main character, Jack McCall, who had moved to Rome from South Carolina to raise his daughter after his wife's suicide because he felt, essentially, that the American South had ruined his life.  He spends the first part of the book focusing on his daughter, saying how he never wants her to meet his family or spend time in South Carolina for fear that they/it will ruin her life as it did his.  The second part of the book, naturally, he takes her to South Carolina and essentially abandons her care to the family he never wanted her to meet while he runs around chasing his past.  He treats his dying mother with bitterness, and never really explains why--all glimpses into his past show him adoring her, and she him.  He hates his alcoholic father, but gets angry when another character disrespects him.  I realize that real people can often be this complex and contrary, and I think characters like that can be fascinating if done well, but in this case it was just confusing and irritating.  It seemed like the author wasn't being true to the character, rather than actual character complexity.  The narration was troublesome as well.  It was told from the first-person point of view of McCall, which is fine.  The premise of the book is predicated on his emotions, and that's the best way of getting right into his head.  A problem arises whenever there's a flashback or a telling of someone else's story, and somehow Jack knows every bit of it.  If he's the narrator, it's only through him the story can be told, right?  Yet there's no way he can know as much of these other stories as he does.  It becomes sort of a first-person omniscient point of view, and it doesn't work all that well.  Conroy also includes some minor storylines that never really get tied up anywhere.  Jack tells his daughter stories of "The Great Dog Chippie," which we eventually find out was his childhood pet.  We never really find out what was so great about this dog, though.  There's only one anecdote that includes the dog, and its role is pretty minor.  There's also a passage in the middle of the book where Jack is shot by terrorists in the Rome airport, and I still haven't figured out the point of that.  And don't even get me started on Jack getting re-married at the end of the book, after making it clear to his new bride that she would always be second in his heart to the first wife who killed herself.  I would understand him just feeling that way, but I can't imagine someone actually going so far out of their way to point it out to the person they're marrying, and I further can't imagine that person being okay with it.  This scenario is a real stretch.  After all this, you may be wondering what I  liked  about the book.  For one thing, there are whole passages where the prose is just incredible.  Conroy definitely has a way with words.  I love the English language, and I have a hard time disliking the writing of anyone who is good with it.  Another thing that draws me into a book is strong emotion and rapport between characters.  Conroy did well with this.  The dialogue was wooden at times, but never so much so that the characters didn't seem real.  I had a feel for each of the main characters, and this book, for all its flaws, is definitely emotionally charged.  I felt the emotion, and it drew me in.  Still, I just don't think I can get past the ending.  I was really bothered by how quickly and neatly everything ended.  This wasn't a book that should have gone that way.  With all the conflicts these people had, it should have been impossible for everything to be reconciled,  especially  Jordan and his father.  The way Conroy brought an end to that conflict is sloppy and inexcusable.  I'm going to read this book again, though, and I'll post more thoughts if anything substantial comes up.

       Schoolboy Trojans  was originally going to be the next book I brought with me to read on my lunch breaks.  My plans were changed when I took yesterday off sick, and ended up reading the entire book while getting my car worked on.  My new lunchtime book will be  The Godfather , by Mario Puzo.  It's the book that the classic film was based on.  I've seen parts of the movie, but never the whole thing in its entirety.  If I enjoy the book, I'll likely see the film.  I really liked  Schoolboy Trojans .  When I finished it, though, I had to ask myself whether I would have liked it as much if it wasn't set in my own hometown.  The answer is probably not.  Boiled down, it was essentially the story of the author's younger days and what a jerk he was then.  Mildly entertaining, but not all that compelling on its own.  The fact that it was set in Troy, Ohio--my hometown, the place I grew up, a place I love and am intimately familiar with--was what made it great for me.  Granted, the author (Vernon Vaughn Knuckles Jr.) graduated from Troy High School 32 years before I did, and Troy has seen some drastic changes since then.  Still, a lot of stuff is the same.  I  knew  many of the places he mentioned, and that's what made it fun.  Also, the author changed the names of real people, making them "characters," but in many cases it was impossible to not know who he was talking about.  Not the main cast of his friends, but several Troy High School legends were brought up--Bob Ferguson, Tom Vaughn, Tom Myers, Ryan Brewer, etc.  You can't go to Troy High School and not recognize these names, even when they're changed slightly in the interests of fictionalization.  Up next:  a review of Pat Conroy's  Beach Music .

      The apartment building I live in has a laundry room for use by the residents.  Is it really so hard for people to clean their own lint from the dryers when they're finished?  I hate opening a dryer to put my clothes in and having to dig someone else's lint out of the trap.  I  always  clean mine out when I'm finished.  Why am I doing laundry tonight anyway?  I'm sick, dammit!

      Home sick today.  As irritating as my job has been lately, I'd rather be totally healthy and there than sick and here.  Oh well, it's just a cold and it'll pass shortly.  I'm already feeling quite a bit better than I was when I woke up this morning.  Maybe that's just the drugs.  High on Day-Quil and feeling mostly okay, I took my car to Midas for an oil change and a brake job.  I remember mentioning the fact that I needed a brake job a while ago; I finally got it taken care of today.  I said yesterday that I would need a new book for my lunch hour, and that the book would probably be  Schoolboy Trojans , by Vernon Vaughn Knuckles.  As it turns out, I'll have to find a different one, as I took that book with me to Midas and managed to read the whole thing while waiting for the work to be done on my car.  They didn't take an inordinate amount of time to do it, but I was there for maybe two hours, and the book wasn't all that substantial.  It was pretty entertaining, though.  It also made me miss my hometown fiercely.  I need to get back there soon.  Tomorrow I'll probably be back at work and all revved up for the weekend.

      Nope, it doesn't rhyme.  It's a fun word, though, and I rarely get to use it.  Also, it's random, so it fits right in with the spirit of this entry.  Spork spork spork.   Brandi is ending her extended weekend today, leaving BG and heading back to Stow.  She's finally starting to feel better, so she's going back to work today.  It was awesome to have her stay for a couple extra days, it just sucks that she had to get sick in order to do it.   Of course, one thing Brandi and I do very well is share.  Brandi has decided to share her illness with me.  Isn't that lovely?  It hasn't hit me nearly as hard as it did her, though.  At least not yet.  I've just got a bit of a stuffy nose and a sore throat.  Generally, colds don't bring me down too much.   Brandi will be in the area again this time next week, having her wisdom teeth removed.  Ouch!   Today on my lunch break I finally finished  Beach Music  by Pat Conroy.  I liked it a great deal, although I also have quite a bit of criticism for it.  I'll post an in-depth review maybe tomorrow, after I've had some time to think about it and let it all sink in.  Finishing the book means I need to pick out a new book to read on my lunch hour.  I'll probably go with  Schoolboy Trojans  by Vernon Vaughn Knuckles Jr., which is a book about my hometown of Troy, Ohio (and the high school football team) in the 50s.  I think I can get through that one pretty quickly, and then I'll probably move on to  The Godfather  by Mario Puzo or  The Winds of War  by Herman Wouk.   The weather outside is awesome today.  I wish the Mud Hens were in town.  I need to get to a game soon.   I'm on the "John Kerry for President" e-mail list, and I just got an e-mail written by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.  I have enormous respect for Mr. Clinton, but I wish they had chosen a different photograph to include than the one that Conan O'Brien uses for his bit where he "talks" with different individuals (Clinton, Bob Dole, Kathy Lee Gifford, etc.) by superimposing video of someone else's mouth onto a headshot photograph.  It's just hard to take that photograph seriously when it's been the source of so much Conan hilarity.   Before leaving work yesterday, I talked to our head engineer about the stability of our jobs.  He said he feels pretty secure, and that the staff really can't be cut any further than it already is.  That goes for shop staff as well as office staff.  I just wonder if he knows that so many of the guys out in the shop aren't planning on sticking around much longer, and how much his opinion would change if he did.

      One of my earliest blog posts was about my desire to have an actual door on the entryway into my office ( urlLink The Joy of Doors ).  Several months later, I find myself wanting this more than ever.  I can overhear far too much conversation going on in nearby offices.  One of our shop guys, having noticed the trend of people around him disappearing, today accepted a position with another company.  Who can blame him?  He wrote up a sheet giving notice that this Friday will be his last day here, and stuck it in the company president's mailbox before leaving for the day.  It so happens that the next office over from mine belongs to the office manager.  Our company president was just in there, informing the office manager of said shop guy's impending departure, and bitching about the "lack of notice," without a trace of irony in his voice.  This, of course, is coming from the same person who has staged a flurry of layoffs recently, informing the guys as they left on Friday that they shouldn't come in on Monday.  Lack of notice, indeed.  Oh, and I also might mention that he doesn't deign to tell them himself; he has the head engineer do it.  I'm aware that it's traditional to give an employer two weeks of notice before a resignation; however, employees here don't even know right now if they'll be employed here next week.  Given the situation, I don't think an end-of-week notice is at all inappropriate.  Given all of this, I'm going to be stepping up my own job search, for a couple of reasons.  For one, I'm losing more respect for certain co-workers and the company's leadership with each passing day, and that leads to self-loathing when I realize I'm  working for  this clown.  Beyond that, I don't see how this place is going to survive much longer.  Most of the remaining few shop guys are close to landing other jobs, and this isn't the sort of place where they can bring anyone in off the street and train them to do the job in a day or two.  The company president has no respect for the expertise he has here in his shop right now.  They're not well paid (no one here is), they're not particularly well treated, and now they have no sense of job security.  Of course they're going to leave!  This isn't just the shop guys, either--our production manager and head engineer are also actively looking elsewhere.  If even some of these people leave, I don't know how this place can function.  No one is irreplaceable, but no one here is easily replaceable.  The powers-that-be would have a hard time attracting quality workers because he has no desire to pay anyone.

      Normally, Tuesday is a Subway day for me.  Unfortunately, Thursday is also a Subway day.  Only Wendy's has the power to keep me interested when I eat there twice a week, so I've been on a bit of Subway burnout lately.  I didn't go there at all last week, and didn't really feel like eating there today.  So, I decided to try something new.  Today for lunch I ate at a place called Magic Wok.  I like Chinese food.  That hasn't always been the case--I used to avoid it like the plague.  It grew on me over time, though, and now I like it quite a bit.  Surprisingly, this was my first time eating at Magic Wok, even though it's not a new restaurant and I drive by it almost every day on my lunch break.  Sadly, the food wasn't that good.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't nearly what I had hoped for.  I can see myself going in there again, but I won't be making it a regular stop.  In general, lunchtime just isn't what it used to be.  I find myself missing Tony Kornheiser's show on ESPN Radio more and more each day.  I do listen to Colin Cowherd, the guy who took over Tony's time slot, and he's grown on me a little bit.  I find him mildly amusing, but that's as far as it goes.  Despite the fact that it was on ESPN Radio, Tony's show wasn't always about sports.  Maybe that's why he's gone, but that's one of the reasons I liked it.  Tony's a lot like me:  an intellectual kind of guy who has plenty of interests outside of sports.  He'd talk about a little bit of everything, and that was great.  It challenged and informed me.  There were plenty of times when I got back from my lunch break and wrote in this very blog about something Tony was talking about, be it sports or otherwise.  Cowherd will occasionally talk about topics other than sports, but when he does so the conversation tends to degenerate into a discussion of attractive women or one of the show's producers talking in his trucker voice.  That's about it.  It's mildly entertaining, but it doesn't exactly require all my brain cells.  Make no mistake, Tony could also be banal at times, but even when he was, he was still intelligent.  That appeals to me a lot.  Sophomoric humor is readily available pretty much anywhere; intelligence is a lot harder to find, especially on a sports channel.  It seems to me that Cowherd's show is just like every other sports talk show.  I'm still hoping that Tony will end up on the radio again someday.  It won't be ESPN Radio, but hopefully it'll be syndicated with a Toledo affiliate so I can hear it.  I need something to entertain AND enlighten me on my lunch break each day.  Come back to the radio, Tony!  Do it for the kids!  (We need Old Guy Radio!)

      "That's the biggest problem around here:  everyone thinks too much."  I just overheard this declaration from a co-worker.  This is just wrong on so many levels.  Personally, I used to have several different ideas about what the biggest problem was around here, but now I know unequivocally what it is.  The biggest problem around here is that someone actually thinks the biggest problem around here is that everyone thinks too much.  If  anyone  is thinking too much, they sure aren't thinking about the right things.  I think the person who uttered this ridiculous statement just wants to be able to tell people what to do and not have them question it.  If that ever happens, we'll be in worse shape than we are now, if that's possible.  Of course, I should also mention that I overheard this same co-worker several months ago trying to convince our receptionist that child pornography is legal.  Obviously, this person isn't too aware of...well, anything.

      As spring makes its way toward summer, it seems to be the time of year for significant changes.  Looking around, I can see evidence of this everywhere.  My friend Mike just graduated with his Bachelor's degree and will be moving soon.  I think my cousin Mike may have just finished his internship, and therefore also graduated.  Cricket just got her Master's, got a job, and will be moving to Texas, along with Adam, who was just accepted to grad school.  Jamie just got a job in Chicago and will be moving soon.  Erin is pregnant.  Jessica just got engaged, and is looking to buy a house.  Even closer to me, Brandi is looking for a new job, and it seems like she's close.  She'll be moving back to Bowling Green sometime this summer, come hell or high water.  I think this is how it was supposed to be four years ago, when I graduated.  Somehow, though, everything managed to hold off until now.  I just hope it rubs off on me somehow.  The only real change I'm looking for is a new job.  I haven't had any luck with this, but maybe I will soon.  It seems like something's in the air right now.  One thing that may be changing for me in the near future is this blog.  Blogger re-launched over the weekend, with a significant re-design to their site and some added functionality.  I haven't really looked too hard at what they've done just yet, but even doing a quick skim showed some pretty cool stuff.  I'll probably be experimenting some with it in the coming days, so be aware that some changes may be taking place in this blog.  It's not a new job, but it's better than nothing.

      Wow.  It's a Monday morning, and there's plenty going on.  I feel rested, I have work to do, and I've actually enjoyed being at work so far.  I'm not counting on any of these things being the start of a trend, but it's definitely a nice change.  [  Editor's Note:   it's Monday morning when I'm  starting  to write this; it'll probably be into the afternoon before I  finish  it. ]  The reason I feel rested, I'm sure, is because I actually felt like the weekend was long enough for a change.  Normally I come in here on Monday morning, feeling like "where in the hell did the weekend go?"  Today it's not like that.  This weekend was the perfect mixture of busy fun stuff and lazy down time.  I love that.  Brandi came into BG shortly after I got home from work on Friday.  She got off work before noon and spent some time in between in her hometown of Clyde.  I straightened up my apartment a bit before she got there.  She had gotten up extremely early that morning and had a pretty busy day, so she was tired.  She took a nap while I watched the Reds game on TV.  After she woke up, we got ready and went out with our friends Cricket and Adam (and a slew of others) to celebrate Cricket's graduation.  She got her Master's Degree is Music Education.  Actually, Adam was just accepted to grad school in Texas (near Austin), and Cricket just got a job down there, so they'll be moving sometime this summer.  It sucks for us, but it's a good opportunity for them.  We went to several different bars over the course of the night, and had a really good time.  Adam actually used to be a roommate of mine, but I think we talked more on Friday than we ever have before in our lives.  We wanted to get something to eat after our night of drinking, but the Corner Grill was full, so we ended up going to Cricket's place for leftover Sloppy Joes.  I happen to love a good Sloppy Joe, so that was fine by me.  Adam told me the next day that he fell down the steps after we left that night.  Ouch!  Saturday started off as a pretty lazy day.  Brandi and I stayed in bed until almost 1:00.  We got up and watched the Reds game on TV (yes!), and I went and got Wendy's for us for lunch (yes!).  We just hung out for a bit after that.  Brandi had plans that evening to meet up with her sister and a friend from high school for dinner, so she left around 6:15.  I mostly just played PlayStation while she was gone.  She came back a while later and we hung out some more, and then later that night I went to a party at my friend Jamie's place.  Jamie just got a job in Chicago, so she'll be moving later this month.  I didn't drink at the party, since we had been out drinking the night before and I didn't feel like it.  It was a good time, though.  I got to talk for a while to my friend Mike, who finally just finished his Bachelor's Degree and should now be able to hang out more.  Sunday was definitely a lazy day, all the way through.  We started it off by sleeping into the afternoon once again.  We laid around for a while, then finally went out for a late lunch/early dinner.  We went to the same Mexican place we ate at the weekend before, and it was good once again.  From there we proceeded to Wal-Mart, where we bought some outdoor toys (a Nerf football and some bubbles), and then onto campus to play around for a bit.  It started looking a little stormy, so we headed back to my place.  We watched some TV while it rained, then went back out to get some ice cream after it cleared up.  We brought our ice cream back to the apartment and parked ourselves on my couch to watch  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone , which was being shown on ABC.  We've seen it about a million times already, of course, but this showing included some new footage, as well as a preview of  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  (which comes out June 4) and some commentary by stars Dan Radcliffe (Harry), Emma Watson (Hermione), and Rupert Grint (Ron).  The only downside to all of this is that Brandi woke up feeling a little sick yesterday, and it got worse as the day wore on.  She went to the doctor today to get some allergy medication, so hopefully that will make her feel better.  For today, though, she's already called in sick to her job, so she'll be staying with me another night.  While I'm in favor of this, it sucks that she had to get sick in order for it to happen.  Today has been a pretty decent day at work so far as well.  We're gearing up for some coming orders, so I've had some stuff to do.  This morning I got to ride along as we tested a piece of equipment we're getting ready to ship.  That was pretty cool.  Trends, please begin...NOW.

      On my old blog template, I maintained a list entitled "What I'm Reading Now."  On this list I noted which books I was currently in the process of reading (or re-reading).  I haven't yet added that feature to my new template, but it will be back eventually.  I'm working on a couple of ideas for possibly doing it a bit differently.  In the meantime, I want to mention that last night I finished my most recent re-read of Stephen King's  Wizard and Glass  (which I've  urlLink talked about before ) and started re-reading  Wolves of the Calla .  These are Books IV and V, respectively, of King's  Dark Tower  series.  The next installment, Book VI,  Song of Susannah  is scheduled to be released on June 8.  I'll almost certainly be picking it up on its release date, and I want to finish off  Wolves  before then so I can be up to date and ready to dive right into the new one.  I'm a fast reader, so I highly doubt I'll have any trouble being ready.  You never know, though.  I'm really excited for the new book.  I love this whole series.  I've been a Tower junkie since I was in junior high, I believe, when I got the first two books of the series ( The Gunslinger  and  The Drawing of the Three ) as a Christmas gift.  It's been a frustrating interest at times, as additional books have generally been long in coming.  However, King wrote the final three books in quick succession, so the wait is almost over.   Wolves of the Calla  was released last November;  Song of Susannah  will be here in a few weeks; and the final volume,  The Dark Tower , will be released in September.  I think I can probably work in yet another re-read of the whole series (and some of the auxiliary books) between June and September.  Of course, the release date for  The Dark Tower  also happens to be the release date for the original  Star Wars  trilogy on DVD.  That's going to be an expensive day for me.  It also means that my reading of that final book may be stretched out, as I'll have to work it in between viewings of my all-time favorite  movie  series (provided George Lucas doesn't totally ruin it with even more tweakings).

      It isn't even June yet, but it's already starting to feel like summer.  Ohio is like that a lot of the time, though.  Spring and fall here can be pretty short, at least in terms of mild temperatures.  Generally they're just quick fades from summer to winter and vice versa.  It's not all bad, though:  by the time the Ohio winter is over, we're ready for it to warm up quickly so the possibility of more snow can fade and die.  One thing that's pretty consistent about springtime here is the chance of rain.  If you look at a ten-day forecast for this area, you'll see that there's a chance of rain just about every day, usually in the evenings.  It doesn't always happen, of course, but there's usually at least a chance.  Even on nights when it doesn't actually rain, it's fairly common to see a flash of lightning or two, especially when the humidity is high.  That's how yesterday was.  It didn't rain, but it was hot and muggy.  I decided to take advantage of the lack of precipitation, so I went for a run.  I went out around 11:00 p.m.--according to  urlLink The Weather Channel , it was still 78° with 82% humidity at that time.  I actually like running when it's like this.  I love working up a good sweat, and that I certainly did.  Since the season is still young, I haven't been running much yet, so I'm still working on building up my wind and my legs.  Since it was so hot last night, I didn't expect much from myself.  I did a lot better than I thought I would, though, so I feel pretty good about that.  If I had to guess, I'd say I did somewhere between a mile and a mile and a half.  My legs feel pretty good today.  I can definitely tell that I worked them last night, but I'm not sore.  Of course, I also did laundry last night.  I thought it would be a great idea to put a load of clothes in the dryer and then go out for my run.  What I failed to consider was the distinct discomfort that would be caused to my already overheated body (even a quick shower didn't cool me off too much) by entering a warm laundry room and dealing with a pile of hot clothes fresh out of the dryer.  Yikes.  Exacerbating the situation is the fact that my landlords haven't yet seen fit to enable our building's air conditioning units.  That being the case, the climate inside my apartment wasn't too much different from that outside.  I do have a fan that was at least providing a nice breeze, but it would have been lovely to step into some air conditioned comfort.

       urlLink    The Other Lady In My Life   SO , Blogger now tells me I can post photos in my blog.  With all the other changes they've gone though recently, how could I resist this?  I doubt I'll do it often, but hey, you never know.  I do have a digital camera after all.  I rarely use it, but now I have an easy method of posting to the web.  This could be fun.  Oh, that's my dog Cupid, by the way.  I probably shouldn't say she's "mine," seeing as how she lives 110 miles away, with my parents, but...yeah, she's really my dog.  She loves the hell out of me, and the feeling, I assure you, is mutual.

      In my post on Wednesday about Randy Johnson's perfect game, I said that Tom Browning's perfect game for the Reds against the Dodgers in 1988 was played in Los Angeles.  That, in fact, is incorrect.  The game was in Cincinnati.  The reason the game ended so late was because it was delayed by rain.  My mistake.

      If you've been here before, you may notice a layout change.  I decided to change templates to make this blog a little easier on the eyes.  I still have the code for my old template, and I reserve the right to switch back to it at any time, or to choose a different one altogether.  I haven't totally ruled out either option, because I'm not sure yet how crazy I am about this particular template.  There are some things I like, and some things I don't.  We'll see if it grows on me.  Anyway, I'm going to be doing some tweaking of this template, just as I did with the last one.  There will be some changes coming, although most of them likely won't be major, and shouldn't affect the site's functionality at all.  So enjoy, and as always, leave comments or e-mail if you have something to say.

       urlLink Johnson K's 13 in perfect effort   I happened to catch the last couple innings of Randy Johnson's perfect game last night, and was reminded once again of one of the major reasons why I love sports.  Johnson pitches for the Arizona Diamondbacks, and the game last night was played in Atlanta.  Toward the end of the game, the fans--the overwhelming majority of which, one could assume, were Braves fans--stood and cheered for Johnson, hoping he would finish it out.  When the game was over, they gave him a standing ovation, appreciative of his feat despite the fact that it was accomplished against their home team, and he made sure to tip his cap to everyone.  I love stuff like that.  This is one of the great things about baseball.  You never know what you're going to see, and this is the sort of historic performance you would love to be in attendance for.  This was only the 17th perfect game in baseball history, so obviously it's a rare occurrence.  I'm especially happy that it happened for Johnson, who has long been one of my favorite non-Reds players.  He's simply a dominating performer, and probably the only pitcher I would actually pay money to see.  I generally like to see a lot of offense, but I love watching Johnson pitch when he's on.  He's awesome.  He's such an imposing presence on the mound.  He throws a hard fastball, and when his other pitches are working, he makes the hitters look silly.  It's so much fun to watch.  The only other perfect game memory I have is of Tom Browning's perfect game for the Reds over the Dodgers in 1988.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to see any of that game.  I was staying at my aunt and uncle's house at the time, because their grandson (my cousin) was in town for a visit.  The game was in Los Angeles, so it was pretty late here in the east when it ended, and my cousin and I were in bed.  Of course, being young boys, we were still awake, goofing off.  My uncle is a big Reds fan and knew I was too, so he came in to tell us about it when it ended.  That was pretty cool, but no comparison to actually seeing the game.  Even in the ninth inning, Johnson was dominating the hitters and blowing them away.  I just wish I would have seen the whole game.

      Here's something I found interesting.  Try as I might I couldn't find the origins, but apparently there's a list circulating of an arbitrary reading list, inviting each reader to highlight the ones they've read.  Here's what mine looks like:   Beowulf  Achebe, Chinua - Things Fall Apart Agee, James - A Death in the Family  Austen, Jane - Pride and Prejudice  Baldwin, James - Go Tell It on the Mountain Beckett, Samuel - Waiting for Godot Bellow, Saul - The Adventures of Augie March  Brontë, Charlotte - Jane Eyre  Brontë, Emily - Wuthering Heights  Camus, Albert - The Stranger  Cather, Willa - Death Comes for the Archbishop  Chaucer, Geoffrey - The Canterbury Tales  Chekhov, Anton - The Cherry Orchard  Chopin, Kate - The Awakening   Conrad, Joseph - Heart of Darkness  Cooper, James Fenimore - The Last of the Mohicans Crane, Stephen - The Red Badge of Courage Dante - Inferno  de Cervantes, Miguel - Don Quixote  Defoe, Daniel - Robinson Crusoe Dickens, Charles - A Tale of Two Cities Dostoyevsky, Fyodor - Crime and Punishment Douglass, Frederick - Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass Dreiser, Theodore - An American Tragedy Dumas, Alexandre - The Three Musketeers Eliot, George - The Mill on the Floss   Ellison, Ralph - Invisible Man   Emerson, Ralph Waldo - Selected Essays  Faulkner, William - As I Lay Dying  Faulkner, William - The Sound and the Fury  Fielding, Henry - Tom Jones  Fitzgerald, F.

I'd be really interested to know who put this list together, though, and what the criteria were.  There were some interesting selections made.  For instance, James Joyce has a book on the list, but it isn't  Ulysses .  Similarly, for Steinbeck--with just one book, who picked that one?  And Dickens?  I just don't get it.  Still, it's an interesting list for discussion, if nothing else.  Just to make myself feel better, here are the writers on this list that I've read something other than the material named here:  James Baldwin, Anton Chekhov, Stephen Crane, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, Gabriel García Marquez, Toni Morrison, John Steinbeck, Jonathan Swift, Leo Tolstoy, Mark Twain, and Richard Wright.

      Let me start this entry by saying, "Damn it!"  I'd really like to go to another Mud Hens game sometime in the near future.  Unfortunately for me, according to  urlLink the Weather Channel online , it's supposed to rain every day from now until the end of my life.  Except Wednesday.  On Wednesday, of course, the Mud Hens play at 10:30 in the morning.  At 10:30 on Wednesday, yours truly will be exactly where he is right now:  at work.  Moving on....  Today was a Wendy's day on my lunch schedule.  However, I didn't feel like going to the Wendy's I normally go to.  I go there a lot (generally twice a week), so almost everyone who works there knows me.  While this definitely has its perks, today I felt like being left alone, so I went to the "other" Wendy's.  This turned out to be a good decision.  Before you get your hopes too far up, I should mention that it was a good decision for extremely minor reasons.  If you're looking for a good story, filled with action and adventure, I don't want to waste your time.  This isn't it.  Still, it made me happy, and since I use this space for bitching more often than not, I thought I'd share something that brightened my day, even a little bit.  To start off, just getting to this Wendy's is easier.  Both locations are about the same distance away.  I think this one is technically just a little further away, but I end up getting there faster just because of traffic differences.  The one I went to today is located in a small town; it isn't right off a fairly major interstate (as the other one is), and there aren't as many traffic lights in between.  This means less driving time, which means more eating time (I'm a slow eater) and more reading time.  These are good things.  I noticed when I went inside Wendy's that this location has a sticker on their door indicating that they accept various credit cards.  One of my few remaining reasons for ever carrying cash is beginning to slip away, and for that I am grateful.  When I got inside, ordered, and went to pay, I noticed another thing:  my meal (single combo) was slightly cheaper than normal.  After thinking about this for a surprisingly brief period of time, I came upon the answer.  The Wendy's I visited today is in a different county (Fulton) than the one I normally visit (Lucas), and the sales tax rate is therefore slightly lower.  The difference is small enough to be inconsequential for just one visit, but it all adds up.  Then, of course, there was my initial reason for choosing this Wendy's today in the first place.  Once I ordered my meal, I was able to sit down and eat and read in peace.  At the Wendy's I normally visit, the dining room attendant always stops for a chat, and occasionally one of the other employees will join me to talk for a minute or two.  They're nice people and I generally like this, but today I just wasn't in the mood.  It was nice to be left alone.  Of course, it just wouldn't be me if I finished off an entry on an entirely positive note, so let me also note my one pet peeve about Wendy's.  When are they going to join the rest of the fast food restaurants in putting their drink fountain in the dining room and letting the patrons get their own drinks (and, most importantly, refills)?  Having to stand in line just for a refill is a real pain.  Sometimes they see you standing there and take care of you quickly, but sometimes you just have to wait it out.  I'm sure that discourages a lot of people, and that's probably why they do it.  After all, fewer refills = higher profit margin.  And I don't get refills every day, just because I really don't need all those extra empty calories.  Some days I really need one, though, and it seems like those are the days that Wendy's is extra busy.

      I went to Stow this weekend.  As Brandi and I were both in the process of getting over colds, we didn't do much.  Therefore, instead of boring you with a blow-by-blow account of the whole weekend, I thought I'd just hit some of the high points.  First off, I'm feeling almost back to normal now, with just a little weirdness left over in the back of my throat.  I'm sure that's due to how much we slept this weekend.  We slept past noon on both days, and even found time to nap on Sunday.  It was lovely.  Even when I'm totally healthy, I love a laid-back weekend where I can sleep a lot.  The highlight of Friday came toward the end of the evening.  Brandi and I were laying on the floor together while I sang along with a CD I made for her a while ago.  As much as I love music, I can't sing to save my life, and I'm sure that having a headcold made me sound even worse than usual (I wouldn't know--mercifully, my ears were plugged).  I love to sing, though, and Brandi humors me from time to time.  She even claims to enjoy it, which really just makes me think she's a glutton for punishment.  On Saturday we thought briefly about going to see a movie.  We thought about  Troy , but we didn't feel like hacking and coughing in a theater for nearly three full hours.  We decided on  Mean Girls , but we were caught between showings and didn't feel like waiting.  So we ended up going to the video store instead, where we rented  School of Rock .  Good movie.  It's not an all-time classic or anything, but it was good for about two hours of entertainment.  On Sunday we found ourselves without a whole lot to do, so we went to the mall in Cuyahoga Falls and walked around for a little bit.  I bought a shirt and a pair of shorts.  Later that night we ordered pizza and watched  Finding Nemo  for the hundredth time.  Now I'm back at work.  I'm still catching up a little bit after taking last Thursday off sick, but I'll be there soon enough.  Once I am, it may get exceptionally boring around here.  Then again, what else is new?

       I saw a spider in my office this morning.  I'm not talking about a garden variety black spider or daddy-long-legs, either.  This bastard was brown and thick, probably the approximate size of a fifty-cent piece.  I find spiders creepy enough to be fascinating when they're on television or behind glass.  Otherwise, they cause me much distress.  I managed to find someone to spray it with some substance and bear away its carcass.  Now each time I come into my office I scan around for more.  I'm a little paranoid.  Hopefully by Tuesday I'll have forgotten about it.   It should be noted that "The Spider Incident" is the most exciting thing that has happened around here for weeks.   I'm always looking for ways to improve my blog.  I have a couple of ideas that I'll be trying to implement shortly.  I like this new template, for the most part.  It's more pleasing to the eye than my old one was.  One thing I don't especially like is the wasted screen space.  On my screen, I'd say less than 50% of the horizontal screen space is actually used once you scroll down past the sidebar.  Unfortunately, this template is harder to customize than the last one was, due to its reliance on graphics.  I like it well enough the way it is, though.   Since I have a lot of free time on my hands, I check out quite a few blogs.  I am stunned and appalled at the lack of writing skill demonstrated on many of them.  Why is it so hard to learn proper writing technique?  Poor spelling, punctuation, and grammar abound.  The function of writing is the communication of ideas, and having poor technical skill just causes the message to get lost.  It's sad.  And yet, with so many people out there who obviously have trouble writing, I can't find an editing job.   On the other hand, there are at least a few people out there with interesting things to say and the skill to say it well.  It is these people that make me grateful for the blogging phenomenon.   The NBA playoffs last too long.  I don't know offhand when the regular season ended, but it feels like forever ago.  I'm tired of hearing about the NBA.  It's baseball season now.  On the other hand, hearing about basketball of any kind is preferable to golf, horse racing, or NASCAR.  Oh, and the Lakers, for all the talent on their team, are simply dreadful to watch.  Too much trash talking and thuggery.  Much of the respect I gained for the NBA by watching the Cleveland Cavs and Lebron James over the course of the regular season has been drained by the terrible exhibition of basketball that has gone on during the playoffs.  Yuck.  I'll continue to watch the Cavs for years to come, because Lebron is a joy to watch, but other than that, give me college basketball.  Hell, give me high school basketball.   A long weekend is coming up.  That'll be nice.  I'm looking forward to sleeping in until at least noon each day.  I think there should be at least one three-day weekend per month.  Is anyone against this?

       urlLink    Boba Fett served my lunch today.  Okay, I admit it:  that's a blatant untruth.  This is just another picture from that  Star Wars  exhibit I talked about earlier.  In actuality, I didn't even leave the office for lunch today.  I had leftovers from last night's dinner (Applebee's), so I brought that with me today and ate at my desk.  I brought my book ( The Godfather ) in so I could still read, though.  I thought that would make it seem more like a regular lunch hour.  However, I'd have to say that staying here for lunch is one of the worst ideas I've had in a long time.  On one hand, I'd like to do it more often--packing my lunch would be cheaper and healthier than going out for fast food each day, and I also wouldn't be driving those extra ten miles per day.  That's not much, but with gas prices the way they are, cutting out any extraneous driving is a good thing.  Even with all of these benefits, though, I just don't know if I could handle it.  Staying here for lunch makes the day seem so long.  Time is going slow enough right now as it is, since I have no work to do, and spending an extra hour in the office makes me borderline suicidal.  I like getting out for an hour each day and removing all thoughts of this place from my mind.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if I had some work to do, and the rest of the time didn't go by so slowly.  Being here for nine hours for no apparent reason drains me mentally.  I spend most of that time thinking of ways to amuse myself, like posting photos and pretending I saw Boba Fett at McDonald's.  See what this job does to me?  It's making me warped!  What?  I've been warped since I was young?  Oh.

       urlLink    Hangin' With Mr. Vader  A couple of years ago, the  urlLink Toledo Museum of Art  hosted an exhibition entitled  Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth , which was a  urlLink traveling exhibition  from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.  Being the  Star Wars  enthusiast that I am, I couldn't pass it up.  It was awesome to see so many original props and costumes from the movie.  I've been in awe of Darth Vader for as long as I can remember ( Star Wars  debuted about a month and a half before I was born, so I definitely grew up with it), so this is one of my favorites of the many photos I took that day.  Maybe I'll post a few others sometime when I'm bored.  In other words, look for them  soon .

      Last night I watched  Late Night With Conan O'Brien .  I wouldn't say I'm a regular viewer by any means, but I do like Conan very much, and I catch his show occasionally.  I have to say that last night's show was one of the strangest I've seen, and that's saying something.  First off, lately Conan has been showing a bunch of clips from  Walker, Texas Ranger , a cheesily awful television show which stars Chuck Norris and airs on the USA Network.  Those are amusing just because they're so bad, and because Conan seems to derive so much glee just from being able to show them.  Last night's guests were Tom Arnold and Dan Radcliffe (star of the  Harry Potter  films), and the musical guest was John Pizzarelli.  Tom Arnold came out extremely high-strung, so much so that he was practically vibrating.  He was just hard to watch.  Dan Radcliffe was interesting and amusing, but he was clearly nervous.  I suppose that's understandable for a 14-year-old kid, even if he is an actor.  The musical guest just sucked.  He was a pretty good jazz guitarist, but he could  not  sing.  I say that as an accomplished not-singer myself.  If I had to listen to him sing another song, I would have gone on a scavenger hunt for razor blades.  The funniest Conan guests I can remember have been Harrison Ford and "The Crocodile Hunter" Steve Irwin.  Harrison Ford (who is known to me, now and forever, as Captain Solo) was on there to promote the movie  K19:  The Widowmaker , and ended up talking about how he would love to do a  Dumb and Dumber -type movie.  Steve Irwin was just incredibly energetic and unintentionally funny as he bounced around, talking in his Austrailian accent about his encounters with various animals.  Of course, the reason I initially started to enjoy Conan's show was Andy Richter, his sidekick who has since moved on to other things.  He was a great foil for Conan, who is elaborately goofy and over-the-top.  Andy could play on that, but he was more dry and subtle.  Damned funny, though.  I really thought that the show would have a hard time surviving after Andy left, but I'm glad to see that it's still thriving.  I developed my fondness for Conan (and Andy) during my freshman year in college.  I started off at Wright State University in Dayton, and my roommate was a great guy named Matt.  Just about every night, we'd huddle in front of my TV, usually with our friends Jacki and Lora, and watch late night television.  We'd start off with Letterman (Leno just isn't that funny...he isn't goofy enough), then switch over to Conan when that ended.  After Conan we'd watch  Real Stories of the Highway Patrol , and whatever real-life cop shows came on after that.  Those were good times.  Speaking of Letterman, I also caught about half of his show last night.  I don't have all that much to say about it, except that I was  thrilled  with the musical guest.  It was a band called Velvet Revolver, which includes some former members of Guns N' Roses and the lead singer of the Stone Temple Pilots.  I'm a huge fan of Guns N' Roses, and these guys have been out of circulation for way too long.  It's too bad that Axl Rose couldn't keep his shit together so GNR could still be around, but I think Scott Weiland will be a more than adequate replacement.  I really liked the song they played on the show, and I'm stoked to hear more stuff from them.

      Here I sit, with absolutely no work to do.  This is the worst kind of day.  The time absolutely crawls by, and the end of the day seems to draw no closer.  Even worse, I have nothing especially on my mind that I care to write about.  That being the case, I think it's time to bust out another edition of Random Notes.  I may have trouble even filling one of these.  I'm feeling strangely blank today.   I'm sure everyone will be relieved to know that I've already managed to secure tickets for Brandi and myself to go see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  on the first day it opens (Friday, June 4).  I got tickets to the latest showing (10:10 p.m.) in hopes that as few children as possible will be there.  I'm sure there will still be some, but the later time will keep it to a minimum.  Hopefully.   Speaking of movies...I've been seeing a lot of previews lately for the movie  The Day After Tomorrow .  Movies like this are not exactly uncommon, and it just makes me wonder:  what exactly is the fascination we, as a culture (and perhaps as a species), have with seeing depictions of our world/society being wiped out?   Independence Day ,  Armageddon , Stephen King's  The Stand ...there are plenty of examples.  I want to see this movie myself, so I'm certainly not excluded from the phenomenon, I'm just fascinated by it.  It's a little morbid, don't you think?   The Cincinnati Reds are currently 26-18.  That not only puts them alone in first place in the National League Central, it's also the best record in all of the National League.  I'm the hardest of die-hards when it comes to the Reds, but not even I saw them doing this well.  They've played 44 games, which is more than 25% of the 162-game schedule.  This is manager Dave Miley's first full year with the major league club, and it's the only year on his contract.  If he isn't offered another contract sometime soon, there's something seriously wrong.  Who are the Reds going to get that will do better?   I haven't played my PlayStation since Saturday afternoon.  I expect to have a seizure anytime now.   A sales rep just came to visit me from a steel company we purchase from quite often.  He brought me a cool-ass pen.  This almost makes it worth showing up today.   No it doesn't.   So, uh...anyone in the Toledo area need a good copy editor?

      Have I mentioned that Ohio's springtime weather is inconsistent?  Rarely has that been more true than it was this weekend.  Sometimes it was sunny, sometimes it was stormy.  I can't really complain too much, because it provided me with an early start to the weekend.  While I was on my lunch break on Friday afternoon, the weather was perfect.  I was driving around with my window rolled down and my arm sticking out.  After I got back, the clouds started rolling in.  It kept getting darker and darker, until it seriously looked like nighttime, at around 2:15 p.m.  We all abandoned our desks at that point and gathered in the lobby to watch the approaching storm.  Trees were being whipped around in the wind, and our sign was swaying noticeably.  We saw some pretty brilliant flashes of lightning.  The rain was coming down in sheets, creating a river in our parking lot, and there was even a little bit of hail.  Shortly after 2:30, we lost electricity at our facility.  We stayed in the lobby for a while after that, continuing to watch the storm (I like storms, so this was pretty cool for me).  After the storm passed and the electricity had still not returned, our company president let everyone go around 3:20.  It was pretty close to 4:00 by the time I got home, and Brandi was already there.  We took advantage of my early arrival by napping.  We were planning to sleep for a bit and then get up and do something, but it didn't work out that way.  Sleeping was far too comfy, and we ended up staying in bed until 10:00 that night.  We got up then and ordered pizza and watched a movie, then went back to bed around 2:00.  We didn't have any specific plans for the weekend, so we got to sleep in on Saturday.  It wouldn't seem like we would need it, after how much we slept on Friday evening, but apparently we did.  We got up shortly before noon.  Brandi went to work out while I stayed home and played video games.  We just hung out for a while after she got back, eating leftover pizza and watching TV.  Actually, we got a little goofy for a while and started chasing each other around the apartment.  That was fun.  That evening we got together for dinner with our friends Cricket and Adam.  Cricket graduated with her Master's degree a couple of weeks ago, so we bought them dinner as a graduation present.  We went to Cucina di Betto in downtown Bowling Green, which was excellent, as usual.  Adam had tickets to a Mud Hens game that evening, but the weather situation was uncertain.  We decided to skip it.  It never did rain, at least not where we were, but you never know.  It was supposed to rain, and it looked like it would, so we decided to do something else instead.  We went to see  Shrek 2 , which was highly entertaining.  We wanted to see it at some point during the weekend anyway, so this worked out for all of us.  We headed home after that.   Saturday Night Live  was showing "The Best of  urlLink Christopher Walken ."  I love Chris Walken, so I was pretty happy about this.  Brandi was somewhat less enthralled than I was, and ended up going to bed shortly before it ended.  I joined her when it was over.  We slept in again on Sunday, not getting up until shortly after noon.  We eventually headed out for lunch at Easystreet Cafe, which is another of our favorite places to eat in BG.  It was pretty hot in my apartment, and my landlords haven't yet seen fit to enable our air conditioning, so we decided to stay out for a while and hit some places where it would be cool.  After Easystreet, we went to the  urlLink Wood County Humane Society  to visit some cats, as we do occasionally.  Since we can't have pets of our own, this is our next best option.  However, making a visit on this particular day turned out to be something of a mistake.  Also visiting at this particular time was a fair number of undisciplined children running amok, and the cats were pissed.  Most of them wanted only to be left alone, which made it not much fun for us.  We didn't stay very long.  We also visited the dogs while we were there, but you're not really allowed to pet them, so it wasn't much fun.  After the humane society, we went across the street to walk around the BG mall for a bit.  The BG mall is really close to becoming a waste of time.  If ever Waldenbooks decides to leave, that'll be it.  We weren't there for very long.  We went from there to the grocery, where we picked up a few things to snack on that evening.  After that, we finally admitted defeat and headed home.  I parked myself on the couch when we got home and ended up napping for a while.  Brandi woke me up a while later when it looked like a pretty vicious storm was on the way.  It fizzled out as it approached BG, though.  I think it may have rained a little, but that's it.  We just hung out and watched TV for most of the rest of the evening.  We did read in bed for a little bit before turning in.  Now it's Monday, and I'm back at work.  I was hoping the power would still be off when I got here, but no such luck.  Looks like I'm going to have to spend a full day at work after all.  Oh well, at least I've got an upcoming long weekend to look forward to.

      Dammit!  I just realized that I missed a golden opportunity this afternoon when I was the only one in the office.  There's a set of filing cabinets set into a recess in the hallway that leads to my office, and I've  always  wanted to climb on top of them.  From the first day I started working here it's been a secret desire, and today I missed the only chance I'll probably ever get.  I'm extremely disappointed in myself.

      I think I've decided to kill the concept of having a regular (if varied) title for an entry of random notes.  Since I've never had any actual quotes in these entries, and since coming up with a clever rhyme for the title often took longer than writing the actual text, I thought it was time for a name change.  I've got plenty of random things on my mind today.   I'm the only one in the office right now.  I don't think that's ever happened before.  Everyone else is on lunch break.  I took my break an hour early today and the two days previous so someone would be here to answer phones and such.  Normally our office manager takes a different lunch break than everyone else so that she can do it.  However, since Wednesday of this week she's been spending her days at our company president's house, helping his fiancée clean it up after it was trashed by his ex-wife.  Sounds like a soap opera, doesn't it?  It also sounds to me like questionable business practice, but what do I know?   Coming in and out of the building over the past several days, I've noticed that it smells like monkeypiss outside.  Right outside our main office door, in fact.  I'm not sure what's up with that, but I hope it manages to go away over the weekend.   The upcoming weekend is unfortunately not a long one, as last weekend was, but it should definitely be a good one.  Brandi and I are going to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  this evening--the latest showing (10:10 p.m.) so as to hopefully minimize the number of irritating children at the same show.  Tomorrow we're driving down to Troy to spend the night at my parents' house.  This weekend is the world-famous  urlLink Troy Strawberry Festival , which I thought would be fun for us.  I haven't been in Troy for a while, so I'm  really  looking forward to it.   Okay, it's probably a stretch to say that the Strawberry Festival is "world famous," but it is fairly well known at least around the U.S.  It brings in a ton of people.  I never really cared about the Festival one way or another while I actually lived in Troy (it's not  that  cool, and it creates major traffic problems), but now that I've been away for a while, I'm actually kind of excited about it.  Mostly it's fun to walk around the levee and pick out familiar faces.  Anyone in the Dayton area should definitely check it out, though.  If nothing else, get some of the strawberry doughnuts.  They're probably the most popular item, and they're  awesome .  Proceeds benefit the THS Marching Band.  I was not in the band, but I helped make the doughnuts for the Festival before my senior year at THS.   In case anyone has missed it, I  love  my hometown.  I want to be famous someday just so I can give Troy a plug at every opportunity.   I have 128 pages remaining in  Wolves of the Calla , which I need to finish by Tuesday so I can be ready to jump right into  Song of Susannah .  I should be able to polish off those pages with no problem.  I'm also getting close to the end of  The Godfather , so I'll soon be needing another lunchtime book.  I haven't yet decided what that's going to be.   I'm totally stoked about the continued good play of the Cincinnati Reds.  They were off yesterday after completing a three-game sweep of the Marlins in Florida.  Sean Casey is just pounding everything he sees, and Barry Larkin is doing a lot better than expected.  Ken Griffey Jr.'s average is still a little low, but he's definitely got his home run stroke, and his other numbers will catch up.  Adam Dunn is coming back around, too, after starting strong and then slumping a bit.  The pitching isn't great, but it's been good enough.  I think this team might just be able to stick around in the NL Central race.  Hopefully the front office staff will make some deals to get some pitching help (and maybe a third baseman) if the team is still doing well toward the end of this month.   Speaking of baseball...let me start by saying that I am  not  in favor of taking away fan voting for the All-Star Game, or restricting it in any way.  However, sometimes you just have to wonder how so many people can be so misguided.  Boston's Nomar Garciaparra is currently the leading vote-getter for American League shortstop, despite the fact that he  hasn't played a game all season .  Not one!  He's been injured.  Also, what about Sean Casey being fifth for National League 1st basemen?  Has anyone noticed that he's leading the league in hitting?  I can't argue with a vote for Albert Pujols, who's leading the voting right now, but there's no way there should be three guys between him and Casey.  Hopefully all of this will straighten itself out between now and when the game is played.  I know I haven't cast my own ballot yet, so that will help.   Incidentally, Garciaparra played in Toledo last night, and will do so again tonight and tomorrow.  He's on an injury rehab assignment with Boston's Triple A team, which is in town to play the Mud Hens.  I thought about going out to the game last night--how often do you get to see a future Hall of Famer for just eight bucks?--but ultimately decided against it.  I will be going to a Hens game later this month, though, when they host the Louisville River Bats, which is the Triple A affiliate of the Reds.   I often listen to ESPN Radio (1470 AM in Toledo) when I'm in the car, and they frequently play perhaps the most annoying radio commercial I've heard.  It's a commercial for OnStar in which they play clips from an actual call, featuring what sounds like an old lady wailing in distress after an accident.  I'm sure there are better clips they could have chosen.   On the other hand, there's one commercial in particular that I happen to like, and I'm not sure why.  It's advertising the nationwide crackdown on seatbelt laws, the "Click It or Ticket" campaign.  Anyway, it starts off with a guy saying "Everybody knows that safety belts save lives, blah blah blah."  For some reason, it cracks me up when he says "blah blah blah."   Yesterday while driving, I saw a car with the license plate FA74SS.  From a distance, or just at a glance, that looks a hell of a lot like "FATASS."  I hope I'm not the only one who sees that.

       urlLink Troy's Denlinger verbally commits to Ohio State   urlLink Where the heart is   I must say I'm underwhelmed, both by the news and by the articles.  Before I go any further, let me first offer my congratulations to Mr. Denlinger.  He'll get to live out a dream by playing football for the Buckeyes and get a free college education in the process, and that's awesome for him.  I love it when kids from my hometown and high school are awarded scholarships to play in college.  I continue to root for them and follow their careers, and I'll do the same for Denlinger.  I just wish, personally, that he had gone somewhere other than Ohio State.  Born and raised in Troy, Ohio, just a little over an hour away from Columbus, I grew up a Buckeye fan.  It was inevitible.  Troy is traditionally very much an Ohio State town.  Ohio State dominates the coverage of college football, to the point where you almost don't realize there are seven other Division IA football programs in the state (BGSU, Toledo, Miami, Ohio U., Akron, Kent, and Cincinnati).  As I started getting into college football, Ohio State was the team I started following.  That began to change in the fall of 1997, when I started attending BGSU.  I had become a hardcore football junkie by then, so I went to all of BG's home games, despite the fact that the team wasn't very good.  I didn't feel any compunction about maintaining my allegiance to OSU, since they were obviously on a different level than BG was.  Then something else happened.  My love of football first began with my high school's team, the Troy Trojans, and that didn't go away when I went to college.  I started college at Wright State University, which is near Troy, so continuing to attend games was no problem.  Even when I came to BG, which is over 100 miles from Troy, I still went to the games each Friday.  I still do it.  I missed one game last year, and it was the first game I had missed since 1997.  I haven't missed a  home  game since 1991, when I was a freshman at THS.  I'll do it again this year, and every year until it isn't possible anymore for whatever reason.  In the fall of 1995, when I was a freshman at Wright State, the Trojans started a freshman tailback by the name of Ryan Brewer.  I'm telling you, the kid was an absolute joy to watch, from the moment he first stepped onto the field at Troy Memorial Stadium to the moment he left it for the last time after his #4 was retired immediately following his last game.  I can't even put into words how special he was.  Not only was he always the best player on the field, he was also the most determined, hard-working, and charismatic; in short, everything you want in an athlete.  I'm going to stop myself here before this blog rages out of control.  I could rave about Ryan Brewer all day long if I let myself, as several of my friends can attest.  Mr. Brewer will get an entry all to himself at some point in the future; today I want to talk about Ohio State.  Brewer wanted to go to Ohio State.  They...well, they didn't recruit him, so he ended up playing at the University of South Carolina.  Ordinarily this wouldn't be that big of a deal, but by that time I was spending time on Internet message boards, and most OSU fans were nasty in defending OSU's non-recruitment of him.  That's where my allegiance to the Buckeye football program started to slide.  I tried to separate the team from the fans, but I couldn't do it.  I essentially stopped caring about the Buckeyes, and was even known to root against them on occasion.  When John Cooper was fired as coach, I thought that might make it better.  It didn't.  Also during this time, BGSU's program improved significantly, to a point where they're now much closer to the same level as Ohio State.  That being the case, there was no longer any need to split my allegiance.  I've continued to scan OSU message boards and such, just because it's an easy way to keep up on recruiting in Ohio.  The trend in their fans continues--the arrogance is often stunning.  Granted, this isn't  all  OSU fans, but the obnoxious ones seem determined to give them all a bad name.  Also, I went to a game at Ohio State last year when BG played there, and I had a chance to see firsthand how their fans (and even some stadium workers) treat opposing fans.  Not so good.  All in all, Ohio State has left a bad taste in my mouth over the years, no matter how hard I've tried to like them.  I still try to like the team, even if my interest isn't close to what it once was.  They're in a different conference from BG, so the two programs don't really affect one another that much.  I try to separate the football on the field to all the crap off of it, but it's hard.  Even maintaining neutrality is hard.  It would be great for college football in the state of Ohio if the OSU program would implode, and being a die-hard fan of one of the other programs, it's hard not to root for that.  Still, Brandi is an OSU fan, and it's fun to watch the games together, and having personal connections (even if they're tenuous) makes it better.  So maybe Denlinger will bring me back to the Buckeyes.  Oh, and the reason I'm disappointed in the articles (mainly the one from the Troy  Daily News ) is because I thought the Brewer mess may have created some bad feelings for OSU among Troy's coaching staff, and I thought they might have asked about that.  Maybe that's not the case, though, or maybe the coaching change at OSU healed the wounds.  Who knows?  I was just surprised that there was no mention of Brewer at all.  Again, I want to congratulate Todd, and to make it clear that I'm happy for him.  I hope he does well at Ohio State, and I even hope he wins a national championship while he's there.  I'll definitely be pulling for him.  I'm just saying that if  I  had been choosing, he would have gone elsewhere.

      It gives me great pleasure to announce the addition of a new page to the Barbaric Yawp family.   urlLink The Yawp's Reading Page  is now a permanent fixture on the "Links" section of the sidebar, on the right side of the page.  It's still under some light construction, but it's in working order, so there it is for your enjoyment.  It took a lot of experimentation and work to get it up and running.  I wanted it to look like this page, which meant taking the basic code for the Blogger template and modifying it for use with a regular page.  The code wasn't meant to be used that way, so it presented some difficulties.  I'm still cleaning out stuff that isn't used, but I got it to a point where it's functional, and that's all I wanted before I put it out there for the world to see.  Despite the difficulties, I enjoyed doing it.  I've written web pages before, and it's something I like doing.  I'm not so knowledgeable about it that I could have created the same page from scratch, but I can get in there and poke around and make changes to a base that someone else created.  It's fun, and it's always satisfying to me when I accomplish something that I have no formal training in.  I managed to entertain myself in other ways while I was working on it, as well.  I started working on it on Tuesday evening, working on my laptop while I watched the Reds game on television.  Last night I moved over to my desktop computer, and put my DVD drive to good use--I popped in  The Phantom Menace  and sized it down to a small portion of the screen while I used the rest for my work.  Yeah, I'm a dork.  I'm okay with that.  There will be more pages to come, as I get around to creating them.  At the very least, I want to do a DVD/movie page, a page of links, and maybe some others.  I doubt they'll all have the same format, just because this layout may not be feasible for all of them.  I'll try to keep it the same, though, just because I think consistency is highly desirable in a website.  When all the pages look different, it seems unprofessional to me.  I know these pages aren't professional, on several levels, but I do like them to look nice.  Anyway, check out the new page.  I hope you enjoy it.  As always, feel free to let me know what you think, either by posting comments on the blog or by sending me e-mail.

      As I mentioned earlier, I got my hair cut yesterday.  Whenever I talk about getting my hair cut, I feel like Melvin Udall, Jack Nicholson's character in  As Good As It Gets .  For him it was pills; for me, it's haircuts.  "I  hate  haircuts, hate them.  I'm using the word 'hate' about haircuts."  (Yes, I've used that line before.)  It's been this way for as long as I can remember, ever since I was young.  No matter which way I moved my head, it was never quite what the barber wanted.  That drove me crazy, because if there's one thing I've always been good at, it's sitting still.  I hated the way he would ask me to move my head, then just grab it and move it himself when it wasn't quite right.  I hated the way he always scraped my ears with the clippers.  It was just never a pleasant experience.  It's a little bit different now.  For one thing, I generally go to a walk-in type place where appointments aren't required.  Hating any kind of structure the way I do, this is an automatic improvement.  The stylists at these places are almost exclusively women, so they're usually a little more gentle in guiding my head to where it needs to go.  This is a skill I've apparently improved upon at some point along the way, so not as much guidance is needed at any rate.  As far as making it a better experience, these "improvements" are pretty mild.  I still hate it.  The worst part?  The small talk.  I hate small talk in any circumstances.  I don't want to talk about the weather, or traffic, or gas prices.  I'm a quiet guy, and if I'm going to have conversation, I want it to be worthwhile.  I want it to be thought-provoking, or at least amusing.  I don't want someone to blather on about what kind of haircuts they give their kids.  It makes me want to grab the shears from the stylist's hand and jab them into my eyes.  Okay, I'm overstating.  Small talk isn't the worst thing in the world; I just don't have a need or desire for banal conversation.  Also, I'm not very good at it, so mostly I just listen while they talk.  I'm friendly and try to play along, but if I could just go to sleep for fifteen minutes instead, I'd take that option every time.  Oh, and have I mentioned that I think I look dumb with short hair?  I do.  I think maybe I liked this style when I first started getting it done, but those days are gone.  It's easy to take care of, though, and everyone else seems to like it, so I keep it.  I just don't know what else to do with it that would be socially acceptable.  This morning I ran across a picture of myself from my freshman year of college.  My hair was pretty long then.  I'm not proud to say it, but I had a mullet throughout much of high school.  After I graduated, I just stopped getting my hair cut altogether.  That was awesome.  It took a while for it to grow out, but I wore a hat most of the time anyway.  I can't remember why I eventually decided to get it cut (before I went back to school for my sophomore year), but it was a mistake.  I'd stop getting haircuts again in a heartbeat if I thought it would fly.  I'm tempted to just start wearing my BGSU football helmet whenever I go out in public.   urlLink    The glasses were big, but the hair was cool.

       I will  not  take a nap.   CHECK!    I will take  Return of the King  back to the video store.   CHECK!   I will get my hair cut.   CHECK!   I will watch the Reds-Marlins game on TV.   CHECK!   I will make time for PlayStation basketball.   CHECK!   I will work on my other web pages.   CHECK!   I will read some of  Wolves of the Calla .   CHECK!    I might go for a run (if it doesn't rain).   CHECK!   I might do some laundry (if I feel like it).   CHECK!   I might do some other cleaning (if I get around to it).   -NO-   I managed to do all the things I said I would do, and I only missed one thing I said I might do.  To be perfectly honest, I've probably never been this productive before in my life.  Granted, none of this stuff was earth-shatteringly important, but still, it's nice to know that I can get things done when I make up my mind to do so.  Most impressive, I think, was the fact that I actually went to get my hair cut.  Normally once I make up my mind to do this, it takes a while before it actually happens.  I told Brandi I would get it done this week, though, so I decided to go ahead and get it out of the way.  That mindset in itself is something of a rarity for me.  I'm generally a procrastinator, so it's a little surprising that the haircut didn't wait until Thursday, at least.  I didn't think I was going to get everything in that I did, but I managed.  Actually, I may have even managed to do a bit of cleaning (which I said I might do) if I hadn't spent so much time working on my web pages.  I'm not too upset that I didn't get around to it, though.  Anyone who knows me can tell you that cleaning is not too high on my priority list.  And just so you know, since that sounds horrible, my apartment isn't  dirty , it's just  messy .  There's a difference.  I managed to get my laptop working yesterday, so I worked on my web pages while I watched the Reds game.  I definitely got pretty caught up in it.  I got most of the basic coding down; now it's mostly a matter of adding content and optimizing the code.  I'm hoping to unveil my work to the public in the next day or two.  One thing I definitely did  not  do was get enough sleep.  I continued working on my web pages long after I told myself to stop, and then I wanted to get some reading in.  As I've previously discussed at length, reading before bed is a bad idea for me, because I have a hard time putting books down.  Last night was no exception.  I've read  Wolves of the Calla  before, but that doesn't make it any easier for me to stop.  I think I finally turned off the lights at 2:45 a.m.  Getting up this morning at 7:10 was not easy.  Of course, even with as busy as I was yesterday, I still managed to  urlLink clean my own lint  out of the dryer when I was done with it.  Imagine that.  Anyway, I'm pretty pleased with my success in using my blog for a to-do list.  It inspired in me a heretofore undiscovered level of productivity.  I may just have to do it again at some point.

      Early morning, the start of another week.  Normally that's enough to put me in a foul mood, but today I'm doing okay.  That's probably because I'm coming off a long weekend, with Monday already out of the way, and I've got just four workdays staring me in the face before another weekend.  Of course, my decent mood was nearly ruined when I was asked to perform a task which is almost wholly unrelated to company operations, a task which under other circumstances I would have refused, but that's a topic for another time.  Brandi and I got to my apartment at approximately the same time on Friday afternoon.  We watched  That 70s Show  and then went for dinner (stuffed breadsticks) at Campus Pollyeyes, which is a pizza place close to the BGSU campus.  When we got back to my apartment, the Reds were on TV.  I sat down to watch them (and eventually fell asleep) while Brandi played  The Sims .  Brandi woke me up in time to watch the last out of the Reds game (they won), and then we went to the grocery to get ice cream.  We came back and ate ice cream while we watched TV, and then went to bed a short time later.  On Saturday we slept in, then got up and went to the  urlLink Toledo Zoo .  That almost didn't happen.  When we got there, we were told the parking lot was full, and that we'd have to park several miles away and a shuttle would come pick us up.  We were prepared to head back home, but we had to cruise through the parking lot to get out anyway, and it just so happened that we found one prime spot, so it actually turned out that we got to park for free.  The zoo was fun.  We saw some animals...what else do you say about a trip to the zoo?  I liked the snakes (the whole reptile house, really) the best, but that's only because there were no koala bears.  Koalas crack me up.  I could watch them all day.  Unfortunately, the Toledo Zoo doesn't have them, or we missed them somehow.  We were at the zoo for over three hours, and all that walking made us a little tired.  We took a nap when we got home.  Then we went to BW3 for dinner and drinks.  That was fun.  We finished off the evening at Uptown, even though we didn't end up dancing.  Of course, when we got back to my place, Brandi finished off the evening for real by throwing up several times.  I, on the other hand, was fine.  Sunday started off as a lazy day.  We slept in once again and took our time about getting started.  Eventually we went to Wendy's for lunch.  We came back and started watching  Beetlejuice  on DVD, but didn't even finish it before going in for a nap.  We ended up sleeping for quite a while.  When we woke up, we headed up to Toledo for a party at our friend Adam's place.  Adam and Cricket are moving to Texas at some point this summer, so he threw a Memorial Day bash.  They had a little campfire, and Adam hired a local guitarist to come play, and it was really cool.  I didn't know as many people there as I thought I would, but it was still fun.  Cricket made a batch of Hairy Buffalo, and after a couple glasses of that, I was pleasantly buzzed.  Brandi didn't feel like drinking after her escapades of Saturday night, so that worked out for both of us.  We hung out for a while, and then Brandi drove us home.  When we got home, we discovered  South Park:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut  being shown on Comedy Central.  After a few moments, it became apparent that the movie was  not  edited for language, despite being shown on basic cable television.  That made me extremely happy.  We watched quite a bit of that before finally calling it a night.  Monday, Memorial Day, was another lazy day.  We got up late once again and ate leftover stuffed breadsticks while we watched TV.  Later that afternoon I watched part of the Reds game while Brandi watched some style shows on TLC (I have two TVs in my living room because, well, I'm a geek).  Then we decided to get dressed and go to Olive Garden for dinner.  It's one of our favorite places, and we hadn't been there for a while.  Being Memorial Day, it wasn't too busy, which was nice.  On the way home from dinner, we stopped to rent  The Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King  on DVD.  It's something I'll own eventually, but I'm waiting for the extended four-disc edition that comes out in November.  Anyway, we came home and watched that while eating dessert from Olive Garden, which we brought home with us.  Watching the movie involved much goofiness, which was fun.  When it was over, we went to bed.  Now I'm back at work.  That sucks in and of itself, but as I said, there are only four days this week.  There are plenty of things to look forward to on the horizon, beginning with lunch at Burger King in about ten minutes.  Brandi and I are going to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  on Friday night, then heading down to my parents' house on Saturday.  Next weekend we have tickets to go see the Reds play in Cleveland.  It's enough to make even this crappy job seem more bearable.

      Last night I had a blast from the past.  I got together with my friend McComas (I call him by his last name because that's what guys do...also because everyone I know is named "Mike," so it helps to differentiate).  We were roommates twice in college and once after I graduated (he's the one who instigated my move back to BG from Troy, actually), so we used to hang out all the time.  We haven't been able to get together much for a while, though, with conflicting schedules and the fact that he has a kid now.  We've been getting at least a little bit better about it lately, though.  We got together for dinner last night, then went over to his place and had a PlayStation football marathon.  We used to do this all the time back when we lived together.  We'd sit there in the dorm, or in my bedroom once we moved off-campus, and play video game football for hours on end.  During my senior year, we'd often still be awake and playing when our other roommate got up in the morning.  We didn't play nearly that long last night, but we did get a few games in.  The second game we played was an absolute classic.  EA Sports  NCAA Football 2004  offers several historic teams, so I was playing with '94 Penn State, and McComas took '88 Notre Dame.  He beat me 57-55 in three overtimes, and it was an absolute blast.  The other two games we played we were just screwing around, playing with really bad teams, or with other historic teams just to check out certain players and old uniforms, but even those games were pretty competitive.  This got me thinking.  I love the EA Sports  NCAA Football  franchise; I've got each year's edition dating back to probably 1996, when the game was on PC only.  Most other games I play for a while and then forget about, but never these games.  It's rare for the discs to come out of my system at all.  I play them constantly.  However, about 99.7% of that time, I'm playing against computer-controlled opponents, and as much fun as the game is, eventually there comes a point where I just dominate from start to finish and there are no close games anymore.  I keep playing anyway, because in these games the recruiting is as much fun (if not more so) as the actual football.  Playing against human opponents is always more challenging.  The games McComas and I play are always close, one way or another, and that makes the games themselves a lot more fun.  That being the case, I'm at least mildly considering the purchase of an online adapter for my PlayStation, so I can play football online against real human opponents when the new version comes out next month.  I've dabbled only a bit in online games before now (I used to play  Counterstrike  occasionally), and that's probably all for the good.  McComas used to play  Everquest , and I remember how it totally consumed his life for a while.  That could definitely happen to me.  I really thought about buying and getting into  Star Wars Galaxies , but I'm not yet ready to cease all other activities.  I could definitely get into it, especially considering how much I love all things  Star Wars  anyway.  I'm still intrigued by the game, and I really want to play it, but I'm a little scared of losing contact with everything else that's near and dear to me.  It's like getting into drugs.  It may be just as bad with football.  Sometimes I have a hard time tearing myself away from it even when I'm winning games by thirty points each time, just because I love football and love playing the game so much.  Add in the element of actual human competition, and I may actually stop showing up to work.  The advantage that football has over  Galaxies , of course, is that it's free, whereas  Galaxies  requires a monthly fee in order to play.  When the new football game comes out, I'll definitely be spending a lot of time with it.  If I decide to get the online adapter, I may withdraw from society altogether.  If anyone wants to find me, they'll have to take me on in cyberspace.

      Today I'm busting out yet another page in the Barbaric Yawp family-- urlLink the Yawp's DVD/Movie Page  (linked permanently on the right side of this page).  I've been planning it for a while, and I finally started it last night when I couldn't sleep.  The majority of the work on it, though, has been done today.  It's not hard, just looking up details on  urlLink IMDb  and banging out the text.  If you look at this new page soon after I post this, you'll notice that it isn't quite finished.  It's still a work in progress, but I wanted to get it out there as soon as it was functional.  All the links work and everything, but I haven't yet put in all the information I need to.  I'll probably be done by the end of the day, or maybe sometime tomorrow if not.  I'm so glad I started this last night and had it to work on today, because I've had  nothing  else to do.  Each time I think I can't possibly have less to do at work, I'm proven wrong.  There's no work.  There's some on the horizon, but I don't know how far away it is.  In the meantime, I'm glad to have plenty of personal stuff to work on.  This blog is a lifesaver.  Actually, since my officemate is on vacation and I can pretty much work on this as much as I want without having to hide it every few minutes, it makes the day go by pretty quickly.  It isn't terribly engaging, but at least it's something to do, something I  want  to do.  The first four hours almost flew by--I was a little surprised when I looked up and saw it was time to go to lunch.  This afternoon has gone much the same way.  Speaking of lunch, I went to Magic Wok for some Chinese food today, and it was quite a bit better than the first time I tried it.  I had the almond chicken stir fry, and it was quite good.  I think next time I'll see if they can throw some pineapples into it.  I love pineapples in Chinese food.  I also love them on pizza.  Anyway, enjoy the new page (especially once it's finished), and look for more additions to come.

      Ah, consumerism.  Tuesdays are big days in the world of media.  That's generally the day that new music, movies, and books are released.  This can lead to a lot of hype and a lot of sales.  If I'm excited about a release, I like to go get it on opening day, and I'm definitely not alone in that regard.  Besides, generally there's a good sale price for an item on the day it's released, if you know where to shop.  Occasionally there comes a Tuesday when several items are released that I'm interested in.  Yesterday was one of those days.  On my lunch break, I stopped in at Circuit City to pick up Velvet Revolver's new CD,  Contraband .  I heard them perform their first single "Slither" on Letterman a couple weeks back, so I was looking forward to this release.  I was a big fan of Guns N Roses, so I was glad to find out that some of that band's principal members had a new home.  Simply put, Slash is too good of a guitarist/musician to be unemployed.  The CD had a release-date sale price of $9.99, which is a great price for a CD.  I didn't get a chance to listen to the whole thing, but what I heard of it is pretty good.  It's been a while since I've gotten a good hard rock CD.  I like Circuit City a whole lot, but I have to say that their sales receipts are just ludicrous.  I bought one item--one $10 CD--and the receipt was probably a foot and a half long.  I'm not kidding.  I have a hard time seeing why that's necessary.  That wasn't the only thing released yesterday that I wanted to pick up, so on the way home yesterday I stopped in at the  urlLink BG mall  to visit Waldenbooks.  There I picked up my brand new copy of  Song of Susannah  by Stephen King, the sixth book in the  Dark Tower  series.  The release-date sale price for that was 30% off the cover price, and I get an additional 10% off of that with my "Preferred Reader" card.  Of course, in my excitement, I didn't bother looking to see exactly what the cover price was, but it was probably around $30 for a hardback book.  You know the slogan for Lays Potato Chips, "betcha can't eat just one"?  Well, that's what it's like for me in a bookstore.  I can't buy just one.  In addition to  Song of Susannah , I also picked up  Survivor's Quest , a  Star Wars  novel by Timothy Zahn.  I probably won't be ready to read it for a while, but Zahn's books are so good that I like to have them in hardback, so I went ahead and got it while it's still available.  It's not a new release, so it wasn't on sale, but I did at least get my 10% "Preferred Reader" discount.  I started reading  Song of Susannah  shortly after I got home, and it's pretty good so far.  Intriguing, to say the least.  I got 58 pages into it, and then I made myself put it down.  I plan on taking this one at least a little bit slow.  The next (and final) book in the series won't be out until September, so there's no need to rush.  I can take my time with it, and probably still have time for at least one re-read in preparation for  The Dark Tower .  Incidentally, that book shares a release date (September 21) with the  Star Wars  classic trilogy on DVD.  So that will be another day like yesterday.  Given my financial situation, it probably would have been prudent to hold off on one or both of these items.  I knew I would get them eventually anyway, though, and I figured I might as well get them while they were on sale.  Besides, it could have been worse.  I was tempted to get a new cell phone while I was at the mall, and also to inquire about having my laptop repaired.  I think I showed admirable restraint by forgoing these extra non-planned expenditures.  Isn't spending money my patriotic duty anyway?

      I know I just had an entry of random notes on Friday, and I hate to do another one again so soon, but I'm going to anyway.  Hey, it's my blog, so I can do what I want.   I overslept this morning, and hence was two hours late to work.  I do this from time to time, and it drives me crazy.  I don't know how I do it.  I don't feel too bad about it, considering we're definitely not busy here at work and I didn't miss anything at all.  Still, it's definitely not a habit I'm proud of.  I generally pride myself on punctuality.  That aside, the extra two hours of sleep was quite nice.   Speaking of work, the guy I share my office with is on vacation for the rest of this week and maybe beyond.  This means I'll have the office to myself for a while, which will be nice.  I like the guy, but I don't like sharing the office.  Of course, even when he's here, he's not actually in here all that much.   Despite the fact that the Reds were on TV, I managed to coax myself out for a run last night.  I managed to run almost as far as I had the night before, even though my legs were a little sore at the outset.  I'm pretty happy about that.  My lungs were willing to go further than I did, but my legs were not.  As soon as I can get them on the same page, I'll be in good shape.   Injuries are starting to catch up to the Reds a little bit.  Right fielder Austin Kearns and starting pitcher Aaron Harang are both on the disabled list, and shortstop Barry Larkin left the same last night after hurting an abdominal muscle.  They've lost two games in a row against Oakland, but luckily, they're still in first place for the time being.  Hopefully they can get back on track tonight.   While watching the Reds game, I switched over occasionally to keep tabs on Game 2 of the NBA Finals.  I've tried really hard to get into the NBA this year, and Lebron drew me in pretty well.  The game last night just about killed it for me, though.  The officials call nothing, which leads to sloppy basketball.  I probably wouldn't mind if I didn't know anything else, but I happen to  love  college basketball, which is called much tighter and therefore is better basketball.  NBA officials let the players do pretty much whatever they want, so they gain advantages they shouldn't have, and it's hard for me to feel that is in any way legitimate.  Secondly, I'm not a basketball coach by any means, but what the hell was Detroit doing last night?  Going into overtime, Shaq and Kobe both had five fouls, meaning that either of them was out of the game with one more.  Since they seem to be the only Lakers capable of actually doing anything, don't you think it would have made sense to try to draw fouls and get them out?  I would think that Detroit's players would be driving the lane each time.  Why not?  Two things can happen:  either Kobe and Shaq have to play soft defense, leaving Detroit free for easy layups; or else they continue to play tough and take a chance on fouling out.  Instead, Detroit's players stood around and took jumpshots.  Unbelievable.   Ohio State yesterday fired men's basketball coach Jim O'Brien for recruiting violations.  One of the  urlLink problems I have with Ohio State fans  is that many of them think their programs are always on the moral high ground and can do no wrong.  This is an unfortunate situation, but maybe it will put things into perspective for them a little bit.  I'm interested to see how O'Brien's firing affects incoming freshman player Matt Terwilliger, who is from Troy.  I think he'll probably still end up there (he's signed to a Letter of Intent, so it would be difficult for him to change his mind), but I'm curious to see who will be coaching him next year.  Of course, each time a "major" program loses a coach I'm at least mildly concerned that BGSU head coach Dan Dakich will be poached from our program, but I don't see it happening in this case.  Come to think of it, OSU hiring Coach Dakich would probably make me a big fan of the Buckeye basketball team.  That doesn't mean I want it to happen, though.  I like him right where he is.

      I went for a run last night.  It was the first time so far this year that I've felt good about how far I was able to go.  It's still not quite what I was doing toward the end of last summer (and by "summer" I really mean "however long it was warm enough to run"), but I'm getting there.  I'm building up my legs and my wind to where they need to be, and I find that it happens more quickly each year.  The thing that sucks about running is that you pretty much have to do it outside.  I know there are probably places with indoor tracks, but I can't afford to use them.  When the weather is warm and dry, this isn't a problem.  Here in northwest Ohio, though, only summer is consistently that way.  Spring and fall are usually okay with the "warm" part, but the "dry" can be unpredictable.  I can't run in the winter because it's too cold, to say nothing of the snow and ice that are often covering the sidewalks.  What this means is that I take a several-month hiatus from running each year while the weather is uncooperative.  Each spring, as the weather gets warmer, I have to get back into a routine and build myself back up.  Honestly, I'm surprised I haven't given up, because that first run each year is a killer.  I never make it as far as I plan, and I end up walking back to my place, huffing and puffing and holding my sides.  I started running a few years ago when I realized how out-of-shape I was.  There's a park in Troy where I used to go shoot hoops each night after dinner, and one evening I was invited to join a pick-up game.  The participants were mostly older guys, I'd say probably in their upper 60s, and they were short one person for even teams.  I didn't figure I'd have any problems, so I joined in.  I did okay for a while, but we were playing full court, and all that running just wore me down.  I couldn't breathe.  The old guys were running circles around me, and I felt like an idiot.  Shortly thereafter, I started running, in hopes of getting my wind up and just getting into better shape.  I haven't been invited to play basketball with any geriatric athletes since then, but I feel confident I wouldn't embarrass myself like I did that day.  In my own defense, and to give those guys some credit, in talking to them after the game I found out that they had been playing together several nights a week for over twenty-five years, and they were  good .  At any rate, that's where my running habit started.  I was hesitant to start because I didn't really think I'd carry through with it and do it enough to matter.  I had always hated running just for the sake of running, all the way back to the days of gym class and running the mile (although at least in high school I was able to run the full mile without slowing to a walk, which I could never do before then).  Now that I've been doing it for a while, I like it.  I feel good when I'm finished, instead of being totally out of breath and miserable.  I just have to make sure I go at night, because running while the sun is out drains me pretty quickly.  I could get better at it, I'm sure, but it's just one more obstacle.  I'd rather be out at night anyway.  Since I ran further last night than I had yet this year, I'm a little bit sore today.  I even kind of like that, though.  It's nothing major, and it definitely lets me know that I got a workout last night.  Despite my soreness, I'll probably go again tonight if the weather is in my favor (which it's supposed to be).  We're not quite out of the rainy season, so I have to take my chances when I have them.  Now I just need to figure out some sort of exercise to do during the winter, so I don't have to kill myself getting back to where I was each spring.

      One thing right off the top:  on Saturday, my landlords were doing quite a bit of work around the building I live in.  Included in their chores was the activation of the air conditioning system, which makes my apartment oh so comfortable.  How I would love to still be there right now, sleeping in my bed, totally covered in blankets except for one leg sticking out to enjoy the coolness.  That's so much more desirable than being here, in my office, trying to keep myself awake for no apparent reason.  There are few things worse than coming to work on Monday morning.  Convincing myself to get out of bed at 7:00 a.m. after a couple days of sleeping in is not an easy task.  At least this weekend actually felt like it was long enough, for once.  Brandi got started from Stow a little later than planned, so I got to my apartment quite a while before she did.  I had time to do some reading and catch a little catnap.  She got there a little before 7:00, and we went to BW3 for dinner.  Afterwards we just went back to my place and watched TV until it was time to leave for the movie.  We went to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , which was just released that day.  I'm happy to say that it was quite good, despite the omission of a couple of seemingly major plot points.  It's definitely the best of the  Harry Potter  films so far, in terms of just being a good movie.  More liberties were taken with the text than has been done before, but that's to be expected as the books get longer and the movies have to stay approximately the same length.  I'm a little curious to know why certain things were done the way they were, but I'm sure I'll learn more about it as time goes on.  Maybe they just saved some things for the "Director's Cut" on DVD.  Brandi got up early on Saturday to go have her hair done.  I slept until almost noon, and then played PlayStation and just goofed around until Brandi got home.  She was pretty sleepy after getting up early, so we took a nap.  I didn't sleep for very long, but Brandi slept into late afternoon.  When she got up, we drove down to Troy.  My mom was ready to put dinner on the table as soon as we got there, which was awesome, as neither of us had really eaten anything so we were both pretty hungry.  After dinner, at Brandi's request, Mom brought out a drawerful of photographs.  We dug through those for the rest of the evening.  Brandi wanted to see pictures of me as a little kid, and I think she got more than she bargained for.  Brandi and I slept almost until noon on Sunday, and Mom was waiting to feed us as soon as we got up.  Normally, neither of us really wants food for quite a while after we wake up, but it seemed that both of us were ready that morning.  After eating and cleaning up, Brandi and I went over to the levee for the Troy Strawberry Festival.  That was a pretty good time.  Brandi got a little irritated by the sheer size of the crowd, but we managed to enjoy ourselves nonetheless.  We ate corn on the cob, and a strawberry sundae; we made sand art; I bought Brandi a necklace, and she bought herself a keychain.  Surprisingly, I didn't see anyone I knew, and only one person I even recognized.  I guess I've been away from Troy for too long.  That evening we went over to our friends Amy and Doug's house.  They made dinner for us, and then we hung out there for a while.  They introduced us to a video game called Dance Revolution (or something like that), which uses big floor pads for controllers, which you stand upon and sort of dance as dictated by what's happening on the screen.  It's a little cheesy, but it's a  lot  of fun.  I think we're going to try to find it for PlayStation.  Anyway, we had a really good time there, and ended up leaving around 11:00 p.m.  From there it was back to Bowling Green.  We spent most of the car trip talking about the possibility of Brandi going to cosmetology school, which she really wants to do.  She spent a little time when we got home researching possibilities for financial aid, and we went to bed shortly thereafter.  Of course, as is usual for a trip to my parents' house, I brought home a lot more than I took with me.  Mom sent me back with a bunch of food, for which I'm highly grateful.  I like dealing with food as little as possible, and now I don't have to worry about what I'm going to eat for probably two weeks.  That's very nice.  Normally after a weekend like this, where I have a lot of different stuff to do and I'm in the car a lot, I don't feel like I've had a weekend at all.  That's not the case this time, though.  It was definitely a good weekend, and relaxing in the process.  Of course, I'm tired now, but that's just because it's Monday.  Next weekend's highlight will be my first trip to Jacobs Field in Cleveland.  I've got tickets for Brandi and I to go see the Reds play there against the Indians.  I'm really looking forward to that.

      I've been doing this a lot lately, and I apologize (if anyone happens to care), but in the absense of anything of significance to talk about today....   Coming off a seven-game losing streak, the Reds have now won three in a row after sweep of the Texas Rangers.  The Rangers have been surprisingly decent this year, so the Reds didn't take out a cream puff by any means.  I find that the recent losing streak hasn't damaged my good feeling about the team.  Even when they fall behind, I feel like they can/will come back.  That's been the  modus operandi  all season, and they've come back to form over the past three games.  Next up is a series against the Cardinals in St. Louis, which will be a fight for position in the National League Central Division.  Hopefully Junior can get his 500th home run out of the way in this series and the Reds can get out of town with at least a couple of wins.   I love football (especially college football) more than any other sport, and I always have an itch for it when it isn't in season.  Right now that itch is cycling up towards full throttle, a little earlier than usual.  Last night the local cable access station was showing a replay of a BGSU game against Ball State from the 2002 season.  I watched a lot of it, and it really made me miss the sights and sounds of football season.  It's not just the action on the field, either.  It's the hum and roar of the crowd, the echoing sounds of the public address system, the way it feels to be outside on a Saturday (or Friday--I love high school football nearly as much) evening in the fall.  I miss it.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the spring and summer, but if it could be football season all the time, that would be just fine with me.  As a sidenote, BG beat Ball State in that game, 38-20.   I've spent a good portion of the day just wandering around the office, chatting with my co-workers.  I'm generally not enough of a people person to go seek people out, but I am  seriously  bored here today.  There's absolutely nothing to do.  So we congregate in the lobby, or in someone's office, and just hang out.  You can do that sort of thing when you have an absentee owner/president/boss.   I just found out earlier today that  urlLink Edwin McCain  is going to be performing in Cleveland again on July 2.  I think Brandi is going to buy tickets to that for my birthday, which is a couple of days after that.  It'll be cool to see him in concert again (for the 9th time).  His new CD ( Scream and Whisper ) comes out on Tuesday, and I can't wait to hear it.   Tuesday is also the day that former President Clinton's book  My Life  comes out.  I'll probably go ahead and pick it up that day.  I know I want to read it, and Brandi and my mom have also said they'd like to read it when I'm finished, so it'll definitely be money well spent.   I'm currently trying to think of a way to lay out a links page to go along with this blog.  I'd kind of like it to share the same template with this page and the other pages I've written for this blog, but I rather doubt that will happen.  I just don't know what I would put in the sidebar to the right.  I suppose I could put links over there too, but I don't know what would go over there as opposed to in the main column.  If anyone has any suggestions, leave a comment or send an e-mail.

      This whole "business hours" thing also applies to package deliveries.  It's so hard to get a package delivered because it always requires a signature, yet anytime they come to the door, I'm at work.  It's not exactly easy (or possible) to call in advance and have that package delivered to another address, either.  If so, I could have them delivered to my work address.  Nope, they always have to come to my apartment.  What a pain.  This generally isn't a big deal, but I do like to shop online from time to time, and that means having stuff sent via FedEx or UPS or something.  I don't mind waiting for it to be delivered, but I  do  hate waiting an extra day or two for it when they tried to deliver it when I wasn't home.  I guess I just need to become independently wealthy so I can stay home all damned day.

      I mentioned the other day that I was thinking about digital cable.  I have a few questions about it, and I'd like to get a brochure or something that outlines the different packages and pricing options, so I stopped by the local Time Warner Cable office yesterday on my way home from work.  Closed.  Once upon a time, the office used to have extended hours on Wednesdays.  I know this because I've taken advantage of it on a couple of occasions.  When I did, there were always a couple of other people in there at the same time, also taking advantage of the extended hours.  For some reason, though, they apparently decided to discontinue the practice.  They're now open Monday through Friday 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.  I happen to work Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.  In Toledo.  About half an hour's drive from Bowling Green.  This pretty much precludes the idea of me visiting the office.  This bothers me, and it bothers me a lot.  Sure, Time Warner Cable has a customer service line that I can call, and it's probably available 24 hours a day.  The problem is that the call is answered, I think, at the regional office, and someone I doubt that someone in Dayton (or wherever) is going to be able to answer my questions that specifically involve my service in Bowling Green.  This is why I hate the concept of "business hours."  Being open from 8:00 to 5:00 is great if you're a business that deals primarily with other businesses (as we do here where I work), but a cable company deals primarily with home users.  I can't understand how they survive, given that the majority of their customers are probably at work during the same hours they're open (as I am), but I guess it's working for them, seeing as how they eliminated the one night a week they did have extended hours.  These hours aren't exactly uncommon, either.  Banks, post offices, and car dealership service departments also generally limit themselves to "business hours," and I'm sure there are plenty of others.  It's so inconvenient.  The bank doesn't matter so much to me, but the others are a real pain.  Each time I move (which I do, on average, once per year) I have to fill out a change of address form, and I can't do it at the post office because of their hours.  I have to do it online, which is possible...for a fee.  I had some minor car trouble this morning that I'd like to have checked out by a Dodge dealership, but I can't--they're booked until next Tuesday, and since they have limited hours, I'd have to drop it off and leave it for at least a whole day.  Seriously, if I had a major problem, how in the hell could I go without a car through next week?  It seems to me that if the powers-that-be wanted to stimulate the economy, one place to start would be with a proposal that would somehow encourage places like this to keep extended hours.  It would create more jobs and put more money into the economy, as consumers would be more able and willing to spend their money at these places if they were open when they could actually visit them.  At any rate, I'm not sure now what I'm going to do about the cable.  Most likely I'll just stick with the regular cable I have, at least until I move into my new place in August.  That would actually be a good time to switch, as I'll have to have a technician out anyway.  I might as well upgrade while I'm at it.  I just hope their appointment times are more flexible than their office hours.

      In all fairness, I must note that "Can You Hear Me Now?  Good." is a slogan for Verizon Wireless, and my cell phone service is through Sprint.  I've been spending a fair amount of thought lately on my cell phone service.  I'm not all that happy with it.  I get dropped calls all the time, and sometimes I have trouble getting a signal at all.  Sometimes my phone tells me I have a strong signal, yet my calls won't connect.  On top of that, lately my battery won't hold a charge for more than a couple of hours at a time.  The battery problem is easily fixed, but the other issues are more troublesome.  I've had the same phone since I signed up for the service over two years ago, and it's entirely possible that the trouble I'm having is due to the advanced age of the phone itself.  It's even possible that just replacing the battery would solve all of these problems.  Replacing the battery on this phone is not an option I'm considering, for several different reasons.  For one, I love electronic devices, and any excuse to upgrade to a new and better product is a good one for me.  If that were the only reason, I would be able to discount it, but it's not.  Upgrading to a new phone will allow me to take advantages of new features and services that weren't available when I bought my current phone.  Also, if I replace the battery and it doesn't fix the problems, then I've wasted money on a battery for a phone I'll have to replace anyway.  Besides, after rebates, the cost of a new phone isn't all that much higher than the cost of a new battery for this phone.  That's one thing I do have to give Sprint credit for.  I think most providers offer discounts and rebates on phones to new customers when they activate a new account, but I don't know if any others offer rebates to existing customers once they've had the same phone for a certain length of time.  Sprint does, and that's the only reason I can even consider a new phone.  If I had to pay full price, I wouldn't even be thinking about it.  Of course, it's possible that the issues I'm having aren't related to the age of my phone, and instead are just problems with the Sprint service itself.  If that's the case, then buying a new phone would be silly, and that's why I haven't just gone ahead and done it.  There's really no way to know, though, without getting a new phone and seeing what happens.  Another option--now, this may sound kind of radical, but bear with me--is to wait until my current contract expires, and then just do away with my cell phone service entirely.  At that point it's possible I would become the only schmuck in the world without a cell phone, but I think I could live with that.  Having one is convenient at times, but by no means necessary.  Most of the time I don't answer it anyway if I'm not at home.  I do use the internet feature quite a bit when I'm out, so I can check the weather, movie times, or sports scores.  I think that's probably what I would miss the most, and I could certainly get over it.  As appealing as that sounds, I don't really think I'll do it, just because I like electronic devices and because always having a phone and basic internet access really does come in handy sometimes.  I just need it to get back to being more reliable than it has been lately.

       Each time I think that being at work cannot possibly get any more boring, I'm unpleasantly surprised to find out that indeed it can.  Due to severe storms, we lost power yesterday afternoon around 3:30 p.m.  Unlike the last time we lost power, this time we were not allowed to leave early, so we sat in the lobby for an hour and a half for no reason.  It's bad enough that we don't have any work.  Without power, we don't even have our computers (and hence the internet) to keep us amused.  Due to some miracle, I actually managed to get to work at 8:00 this morning, instead of my usual 8:15.  Of course, our power was still out, so that just meant I had an extra fifteen minutes of absolutely nothing to do.  The guys out in the shop were finally sent home at 8:30 (they come in at 7:00, so they had been here for an hour and a half), but we lucky office folk had to stick around.  The power finally was restored around 9:30, and the computers were ready to go around 9:45.  I was really hoping to go home, but it didn't sound like we were going to be allowed to do that even if the power stayed off all day.  That being the case, I'm extremely glad it did come back.  Having the computer to amuse me is a nice touch, but the air conditioning was a necessity.  None of the windows here can be opened, and it was starting to get pretty warm in here.   Some photos from the baseball game in Cleveland this weekend:   urlLink    If you look closely, you can see Cleveland's skyline in my glasses.   urlLink    Ohio makes good athletes:  Junior and Lebron (in the green suit)   urlLink    (Sean) Casey at the Bat   I'm not totally crazy about cluttering up this page with photos when I post them, so I'm considering the idea of creating a separate page for them.  I'd just post photos on this page when they were relevant to whatever I was talking about, which is pretty rare.  Most of the time I've been posting photos just to post them, so it would almost make sense to have a separate photo-blog.  I might go crazy with it, but hey, if Blogger is going to host these photos for free, I might as well take advantage of it.   Being a Reds fan has been extremely frustrating over the past several days.  They keep taking leads early, then losing them late.  They're currently on a seven-game losing streak.  Pitching has definitely been a problem, particularly the bullpen, but I think the most glaring weakness is a lack of clutch hitting.  The offense has been leaving a lot of guys on base.  Griffey and Dunn are near the league lead in home runs, but neither is hitting for a high average.  A lot of other guys are hurt:  Barry Larkin, Austin Kearns, D'Angelo Jimenez.  This weakens the lineup a lot.  Hopefully they'll be back soon and ready to contribute.  Getting Aaron Harang back in the rotation will also be good.  They aren't world-beaters, but I feel that a rotation of Paul Wilson, Cory Lidle, Harang, Jose Acevedo, and Todd Van Poppel is, at least, fairly solid.  If the bullpen can hold a lead, that is.  While we're talking about the Reds, I'd just like to say that Brandon Larson has done nothing to show me that he's a viable Major League Baseball player.  He tears up Triple A when he's there, but hasn't hit a thing for the Reds.  When Kearns and Larkin get back to the lineup, I hope manager Dave Miley keeps Ryan Freel in the lineup and plays him at third base and sends Larson to the pine, or better yet, sends him down to help out Louisville.  Wily Mo Peña, on the other hand, is doing a decent job with the opportunities he gets.  I don't think he's ready to be an everyday player, but he's definitely an asset to the thin bench.   I saw the clip yesterday of the schmuck at the Cardinals-Rangers game in Texas who dove into the next row to retrieve a foul ball, nearly crushing a four-year-old kid in the process.  The kid's dad, it's worth noting, was in the process of picking the ball up for his son when this moron came crashing down and stole it from him.  The kid's mom whacked at the guy with her program, but he didn't seem to notice or care.  He kept the ball, but apparently didn't stay for the whole game.  Players from both teams sent some gifts for the kid to make up for the guy taking him out and stealing the ball.  The video of the incident is all over the place, so hopefully the guy will have a hard time living it down.  What an idiot.   A note to the Detroit Pistons:  please defeat the Los Angeles Lakers tonight in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win the championship and bring the season to a close.  For one, I greatly dislike the Lakers and I'm ready to see them lose.  Beyond that, the NBA regular season ended over two months ago, and the playoffs are dragging on forever.  It can all end tonight if Detroit closes it out, and for that I would be most grateful.   Flipping through the channels last night, I stopped for a little bit on C-SPAN, of all things.  They were replaying a reception at the White House for the unveiling of the portraits of former President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary.  It was almost surreal to see the Clintons and Bushes sitting next to each other and saying nice things about each other.  I can't imagine that was a comfortable situation for anyone involved.  Maybe I'm wrong.  It's hard to believe it was only four years ago that Clinton was in power.  It seems much longer than that.  Maybe that's because the current administration is so inept.   Speaking of channels, I'm thinking of making the move to digital cable.  I've been wanting a DVR for quite awhile, but I can't get TiVo because it requires a phone line and I only have a cell phone.  Digital cable would only be a couple more bucks per month over what I'm paying now, and I'd get a couple of movie channels and the digital sports tier, as well as the DVR.  It might not be a bad idea to wait until I move into my new apartment in August, but I'd really like to do it now if it isn't going to be too much of a hassle.

      Apparently last week was not a good week to be a head basketball coach at a university in Ohio.  First Ohio State's Jim O'Brien was fired for providing improper benefits to a recruit, and then Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins was arrested for DUI.  Huggins was not fired, but was instead place on an indefinite suspension with pay.  First off, being suspended with pay is not a punishment.  "You don't have to come to work, but we'll still pay you."  If  that  is a punishment, then I  need  someone to tell me what sort of transgressions I have to commit in order to get it for myself.  Particularly if there's some good way to make "indefinite" stretch out to "for the rest of your life."  Beyond that, there is some debate over whether UC took the appropriate action or whether Huggins should have been fired.  I can see both sides of the argument, so let's explore.  On one hand, it seems almost ludicrous that he would be fired.  He was driving his own car, on his own time, and therefore it seems as though any violations he committed would be totally separate from his job.  The two things should have no bearing on one another.  The legal system should be able to handle the DUI charge with no additional measures necessary on the part of the university.  On the other hand, Coach Huggins is the most high-profile employee of the University of Cincinnati.  Any reporting of this case is going to be worded as "University of Cincinnati head men's basketball coach Bob Huggins was arrested..." and so forth.  The UC basketball program has a high national profile, and this story is being reported everywhere.  That brings a lot of negative publicity to the University of Cincinnati, and not just to the basketball program.  When a high-profile employee brings that sort of negative attention to the university, that university is obligated to take some sort of action.  They can't be associated with something as serious as DUI without responding, because that would invite even more negative publicity for fostering an environment of acceptance for this sort of thing.  Of course, everyone makes mistakes and does stupid things from time to time.  Driving while under the influence was definitely a stupid thing for Huggins to do, but doesn't he deserve a chance to prove that this was an isolated incident and not part of a pattern of destructive behavior?  If it is an isolated incident, then Huggins deserves a chance to learn and grow from it rather than being fired from his job and totally castigated for it.  The problem I have with letting Huggins continue in his job is the example it sets for everyone else.  I'm not a big believer in the concept of "role models," especially in the world of athletics, but Huggins is a coach of young men, someone who is supposed to lead them and teach them.  The whole concept of intercollegiate athletics as pitched by the NCAA commercials on TV is that by playing sports you learn about life.  If that's the case, then Bob Huggins really is a role model, and he's setting a terrible example.  Further, the molding and shaping of young men is an area in which Huggins has always had problems.  No one disputes that he's a good basketball coach.  You can look up the numbers if you want; I know he wins a lot of games, and therefore he must be a good teacher of basketball.  Beyond basketball, it's hard to see where Huggins succeeds with the young men under his watch.  The graduation rate for UC's basketball team is horrendous, and the roster has been littered over the years with arrests, suspensions, etc.  Clearly, Huggins is not teaching anyone anything besides basketball, even before this incident.  At the very least, Huggins isn't doing a very good job of selecting players to represent the University of Cincinnati.  Due to all the off-court trouble surrounding the program, the idea of UC basketball player as "scholar-athlete" is something of a joke.  In that regard, Huggins is already bringing plenty of negative publicity to the university.  This DUI is just one more item on top of everything else, and for that I think the university president and athletic director should have at least considered firing their coach.  Not for the DUI per se, but with the DUI being the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back.  Case in point:  when I was a student at Wright State University, our basketball coach was fired for shoplifting vitamins from a local grocery store.  He had been cited for DUI several years before, and consequently there was language put into his contract that allowed the university to fire him if he brought any more negative publicity to them.  Hence he was fired for shoplifting, as minor an offense as it was.  As a bit of a sidenote, Colin Cowherd is a moron.  On his show this afternoon he was spouting off about how ridiculous a notion it was for anyone to even think that Huggins should be fired.  After all, a car wasn't manufactured to be a weapon, and he didn't hurt anyone.  Give me a break.  Driving while drunk is like playing Russian roulette, with the lives of strangers in the balance as well as your own, because you never know what can happen.  All driving is like that to a certain extent, but under the influence it's like having more than just one bullet in the gun.  If someone walks down the street pointing a gun at people, that person is going to do some time.  It's the same concept for DUI.  Maybe you'll kill someone, maybe not.  You can't not punish them for not hurting/killing someone, because the chance was there, and that chance was high.  On another mildly related sidenote/tangent, Cowherd's producer Chadd Scott made a point that you can't fire everyone who's ever had a DUI because a  lot  of people have done it, and the economy would be a total wreck.  That's totally true, and I agree wholeheartedly.  I think the same thing can be said for a lot of transgressions.  Like, say, lying about a sexual affair.  Makes the thought of tossing President Clinton out of office for  that  seem a little stupid, doesn't it?  That's way beside the point, but the thought crossed my mind, and I thought it was worth a mention.

      My calendar tells me that today is Flag Day, so Happy Flag Day everyone!  I don't know what Flag Day is for, exactly.  All I know is that I had to come to work this morning, so it's not a real holiday.  Are the banks and post offices open today?  Probably not; they close for everything else.  The weekend was a good one, although not long enough, as usual.  I need a bona fide vacation, but it'll be a while before that happens.  I only get one week per year (until I've been here five years, at which time I'm upgraded to  two  weeks per year), and I always use those for days off here and there.  The grind is just wearing on me.  I'll be the first to acknowledge that my job isn't tough right now, with virtually nothing to do while I'm here besides writing in my blog and otherwise surfing the internet, but just having to come here and go through the same stupid routine every day is driving me crazy.  I hate structure, especially when it's for no apparent purpose.  I would actually feel better if I had work to do; at least I would feel justified in coming here each day.  All of that is beside the point, though.  I drove to Stow after work on Friday.  Brandi and I went to BW3 in Kent for dinner, and to watch a little bit of the Reds-Indians game on TV.  We hadn't been there for a while, so it was fun even though we each had just one drink.  We headed back to her place as the game went into extra innings, and we listened to the rest of it on the radio.  We were both pretty tired, so we played a game of Scrabble and then went to bed.  We slept in a little bit on Saturday, and then Brandi dragged me to the YMCA where she works so we could work out.  I'm still feeling the effects of that.  Running on the treadmill was fine, as I run all the time anyway, but I hadn't been on a weight machine in years.  I didn't exactly kill myself while we were there, but my arms are still a little sore today nonetheless.  How sad.  Back to her place after our workout for a shower, and then out to Subway for lunch.  After Subway, we decided to go into a pet store located in the same plaza.  For some unknown reason this pet store has a couple of goats.  Brandi was afraid of them, but I petted one.  He (or maybe it was a she...how the hell would I know?) seemed to enjoy it.  I also let a kitten nibble on my fingers while we were there.  That was pretty cool.  After that we headed up to Cleveland for the Reds-Indians game.  I had never been to a game at Jacobs Field, so I was really looking forward to it.  It was fun, even though the game itself was highly irritating.  The Reds led most of the way, but ended up blowing their lead and losing the game.  Also, the service at the concession stands was terrible.  That aside, we had a good time.  We got Omar Vizquel/Dave Concepcion bobbleheads on our way in, and there was a really cool fireworks show after the game.  (We took quite a few pictures at the game.  I may post some of them later, depending on how they turned out.)  We stopped at the grocery store on our way home, intending just to get a snack, and we ended up getting items for Brandi to make dinner on Sunday.  By the time we got to the checkout counter, though, it was past midnight, which meant that we couldn't buy wine because it was technically Sunday.  What a pain in the ass.  On Sunday we slept in again (Brandi got up a little before I did, but I was in bed until about 12:30), then got up and went to the library to use the internet.  I tried to post here, but was rebuffed by error messages.  After the library we went back to the grocery (it was after 1:00 p.m., so we could now buy wine), and then back to her place.  We just kind of hung out for a while, and Brandi ended up taking a nap while I played video games.  I started off playing basketball, but then reacquainted myself with football and with  Grand Theft Auto:  Vice City , which is an insane amount of fun.  Brandi got up from her nap shortly thereafter and proceeded to make dinner.  She made lemon pepper chicken, fried potatoes, corn on the cob, and Betty's salad, and it was all quite good.  After dinner we went outside to play catch with a Nerf football under the lightning.  It was hard to see the ball because it was dark, but it was fun anyway.  We stayed out until it started to rain, and then we went inside and watched  A Bug's Life  and ate strawberry shortcake.  Now I'm here, and I need a nap.  So what else is new?

      I check out a lot of different blogs each day.  Mostly I do it here at work, as a time-killer.  Last night I was surfing through some at home, because I didn't really have anything else to do and I wasn't ready to go to bed yet.  I like to see what people are writing about, to see the wide variety of interests out there, and to get different perspectives on things that a lot of people are talking about.  I think blogging is great because it encourages people to write about whatever is important to them, and then allows anyone in the world to read what has been written.  It's really interesting, on a sociological level if nothing else.  Some people write about politics and world affairs; some write about entertainment and pop culture; some write about their own personal lives; some (including this one) write about a combination of all three and then some.  You never know what you're going to read or find out about, and it's fascinating.  I will say, as I'm sure I've said before, that there are a great many poor writers out there.  They have as much right to the webspace as good writers do, of course, but I for one am not going to take the time to find out what they have to say.  It's too tedious to try to decipher meaning from someone who can't be bothered to take the time to write a well constructed sentence, or to at least spell words right.  It's a pet peeve, but it's widespread and disheartening.  Many sites are shot through with web shorthand and the inexplicable phenomenon of mixed caps (LiKe tHiS).  They aren't being read.  I'm sorry if this seems insufferably high-minded, but that's how I feel.  In my opinion, if you want your writing to be taken seriously, you should take care and do it right.  Also, the following words are used  a lot  by bloggers:  random, rant, ramblings, musings, venting.  I'm guilty as well, but I'll try to control myself.  That tangent aside, there is a lot of good stuff out there if you look for it--good thoughts, good ideas, good writing.  Sometimes you even find all three in the same blog.  If you read widely, you definitely won't agree with everything you see, but I think that's good.  Healthy.  It's always good to challenge your own beliefs:  either you change your mind or you reconfirm your original stance, but either way you're a stronger person for it.  Anyway, last night in my surfing, I ran across the website for one  urlLink Joshua Minton .  Josh and I had several classes together at BGSU, and he was a hell of an asset to every one of them.  I see from his writings that I don't agree with much he has to say politically, but he's a highly intelligent and well read son of a bitch, and he's guaranteed to challenge you and make you think.  Also, he's a heck of a nice guy, and a good writer.  I haven't had a chance yet to fully explore his site, but I see from his links that he's offering some of his fiction online, and I'm looking forward to diving into that, having probably read some of it before in writing workshops.  A lot of the stuff you read in blogs is thought-provoking in a different kind of way.  I was reading one last night (I didn't keep the link, although I wish I would have) written by a lady who's having marital problems.  I've read several similar ones before (from both a female and male perspective) that were nothing more than bitching and blaming.  This one wasn't like that.  She talked about how she could see her husband trying to make things different/better, and they just weren't connecting.  She wasn't angry and hurt so much as she was sad and confused.  It was compelling to read, I really couldn't help but feel for both of them.  I love reading stuff like that (not the negative aspect per se, but just accounts that are honest and emotional) because it inspires me.  That blog was full of the kind of emotion that I try to inject into my fiction.  For fiction (at least, the kind of fiction I write), good or bad doesn't matter.  It just needs to be real, and reading stuff that  is  real helps me get a feel for how to strike the right notes.  Of course, while we're on the topic of fiction....  Lately, I've been writing a pretty fair amount in this blog.  I'm proud of that, as I didn't know when I started (nearly five months ago) whether I would keep up with it or not.  However, I'm sad to say that I haven't been doing much writing otherwise, including fiction or just my own personal journal.  Here I'd like to publicly take myself to task for that.  I still harbor hopes of "being a writer" someday, and right now I'm not making any strides in that direction.  I could list a litany of reasons why, but they would all be nothing more than excuses, each more unacceptable than the last.  That being the case, and with the month of July (not to mention my 27th birthday) swiftly approaching, I'm hereby making the following half-year resolution.  Starting July 1 (if not sooner), I will find or make time each day to write either fiction or poetry (which is considerably less likely).  Journal entries are acceptable as well, although I would prefer to keep on the creative side of things.  A further goal would be to start submitting work for publication as soon as possible.  With all the creative stuff I've been reading (and listening to, since I'm also inspired by music, as I mentioned yesterday), this has been building in me for a while.  I think it's time to stop brooding on it and actually do it.

      Is  urlLink this  supposed to be an ad   for   Bush?  I think the President and his cronies may be even more confused than we gave them credit for, and that's saying something.

      I drove to Stow yesterday evening to take Brandi out to dinner after getting her new job.  That meant a grand total of four hours spent in my car:  two for the drive over there last night, and two more as I came back to work this morning.  I had plenty of time to give some attention to  Scream and Whisper , the new Edwin McCain CD I mentioned yesterday.  If all you've heard of Edwin is "I'll Be" (from  Misguided Roses ) and "I Could Not Ask For More" (from  Messenger ), be prepared to be surprised.  For the most part, his music is so much more than the handful of his songs that are played on the radio.  Those are just generic love songs; most Edwin tunes are good, solid rock and roll.  This new CD is no exception, and it's awesome.  Here's the track listing:  1.  Coming Down 2.  Shooting Stars 3.  Throw It All Away 4.  Say Anything 5.  Turning Around 6.  Couldn't Love You More 7.  Good Enough 8.  Farewell to Tinkerbell 9.  How Can You Say That To Me 10. Day Will Never Come 11. Save the Rain 12. White Crosses 13. Wild at Heart 14. Maggie May  The disc begins and ends on a high note.  "Coming Down" is an upbeat song about returning to a familiar place after a long journey, and it probably refers to Edwin's struggles with his record company and his return to creative control.  "Maggie May" is a cover of a Rod Stewart tune.  I'm not all that familiar with the original, but I can't imagine Stewart himself doing it better.  The whole band rocks out on this one.  In between, the songs run the gamut of topics and emotions.  Edwin often does topical songs, and there are a couple of this album.  "Good Enough" tells of performers who are welcome at venues while they're doing their act but sent on their way afterwards due to the color of their skin (I'm good enough to play / But not good enough to stay).  "White Crosses" is about the pain of migrant workers.  I think it says a lot about Edwin, both creatively and as a person, that he can write and perform these songs through the eyes of people that belong to sociological groups that he does not.  A theme on this disc that I personally find fascinating is that of growing up and leaving behind youthful joys.  Edwin touches on this briefly in "Couldn't Love You More," and explores it head-on in "Farewell to Tinkerbell" and "Wild at Heart."  Those songs make an interesting contrast.  "Farewell to Tinkerbell" is a cheerful song that realizes that leaving things behind isn't the end of the world, whereas "Wild at Heart" is a melancholy reflection on what will be missed.  Musically, this album is very enjoyable.  Edwin has generally been the band's chief songwriter, and he's very good at it.  For several songs on this album he collaborated with other writers, and a couple were written by Pete Riley, a guitarist in the band who was a solo artist before joining up with Edwin.  The results are awesome.  The lyrics convey the thoughts and emotions of the song, and they blend together perfectly with the melodies.  Edwin is a great singer, and when he really belts it out, you can feel it right along with him.  He's surrounded by excellent musicians.  You really have to see them play in person to appreciate how good they are and what good chemistry they have.  The only thing I can really add is that I would have liked to hear Pete sing more.  I really like the solo album he put out, and I think hearing his voice would have been awesome.  He provides awesome harmony on choruses, and his voice shines through from time to time, but I think it would have been cool for him to get a verse or two all to himself.  My favorite song from this CD so far is "Shooting Stars," which I can already sing along to.  It's a writing collaboration between Edwin, Pete, and Angie Aparo, who is another great singer/songwriter.  If I had to choose beyond that, I don't know if I could do it.  All of the songs are great.  Perhaps the thing I appreciate most about Edwin's music is that it inspires the artist in me.  I want to write the stories his songs tell me.  The best example is the song "Sign on the Door" from his  Messenger  album, but there are no shortage of songs like that on this disc.  I already mentioned the theme of growing up, which is something I explore occasionally in my own fiction.  Another is that of miscommunication in relationships, which comes up in "Say Anything."  Songs like this make me want to sit down and write the perfect story, and that makes me respect the hell out of Edwin both as a songwriter and as a musician.  If you like good rock music and maybe something a little different from anything on the radio these days, give this album a listen.  Better yet, check out a concert (tour dates on the  urlLink official website ).  You can thank me later.

       Brandi called me at work a few minutes ago to let me know that she's been offered a position with a health club in Toledo.  Needless to say, we're both pretty stoked about that.  She was going to move back to Bowling Green next month anyway, whether she had a new job lined up or not, but it's definitely a relief that she now has one secured and doesn't have to worry about it anymore.  I know she was worried about it, but she's done a good job of sticking it out with this particular possibility, and it paid off for her (and us) in the end.  She won't be working full-time to start, but she'll be getting some good hours, and she'll be able to pick up extra shifts and move up to full-time status.  That means she'll probably be without health coverage in the meantime, but it's really not the end of the world--it shouldn't be for too long.  I could tell even in our short phone conversation how relieved, excited, and happy she was, and that's the best part of the whole thing.   She actually had two interviews in Toledo this morning (she was hired at the second one), and found a few minutes in between to visit me here in the office.  That was quite a nice surprise.  She was wearing a new dress that she got yesterday for her birthday, and she was lovely.  I wish I had a picture to share, but alas, I don't.   We went last night to have dinner at Brandi's parents' house.  Her stepmom made lasagna, which was really good, and I got to take home the leftovers.  Their main present to Brandi was a little grill, which will be awesome to have this summer.  We had been talking about getting a grill anyway, after we move in together, and now it's something we don't have to worry about.  As a sidenote, their dog Buster loves the hell out of me.   The new Edwin McCain CD,  Scream and Whisper , came out yesterday, and I buzzed into Circuit City on my lunch break to pick up my copy.  I've only listened to it once all the way through, so I don't have anything to say about it more profound than "it sounds good."  It  does  sound good, though, and I'll go so far as to say it sounds awesome.  All of Edwin's albums are very good, and this one doesn't disappoint at all.  On first listen, my favorite tracks are "Shooting Stars" (co-written by Angie Aparo, another one of my favorites), "Say Anything" (the first single), "White Crosses," and "Wild at Heart."  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes quality rock and roll, and I even more highly recommend you go see Edwin perform live if/when he's in your area.  They put on a great show.   I mentioned that I bought a new cell phone this weekend, and as I use it, I'm discovering that it has the potential to be great.  The sound quality is great, even when I only have one bar on my signal strength indicator.  However, many of the features I won't be able to try out for a while.  Sprint PCS has a "Vision" plan that includes internet access, as well as access to goodies like ringers, picture sharing (yep, it's a camera phone), games, etc.  My phone supports this service and I signed up for it, but I can't use it until July 6 because of the way their system is set up.  Essentially, my new plan won't start until the beginning of my next billing cycle, in order to avoid prorated charges.  On one hand that's very convenient, but it's also highly irritating because my phone can do all this cool stuff and I want to play with it RIGHT NOW!  I suppose I can wait a few more days for it, though.   Things have been picking up a little bit lately here at work.  That is to say, I've actually had a few things to do so far this week.  It sounds implausible, but it had been a while since I had  anything  to do, so every little bit is an improvement.  We're still a long way from being busy, though.

      Now that I've seen this movie twice, I feel qualified and ready to discuss it.  Anyone who hasn't seen the movie and/or read the book and plans to do so,  please skip this particular entry , as I will be discussing certain plot points and would thus be "giving away" part of the story.  I have to start by saying that I liked this movie a great deal.  It's the best of the bunch so far, in terms of actual movie quality.  By that I mean that the acting, film direction, cinematography, etc. were all better than they were in the first two.  The first two basically attempted to just transpose the books into film.  I like that on a certain level, but the books are getting longer, and the first two movies were already well over two hours each.  At some point, different tactics needed to be used, or else the films were going to start being prohibitively long.  Actually, in thinking about this movie, I have to wonder how successful they're going to be in turning the rest of the books into films.  All of the remaining books are or will be considerably longer than  Azkaban , and yet already this one feels rushed.  Probably every criticism I have of this movie comes back to that:  things from the book often had to be sped up or left out completely in order to deal with time constraints.  My most major beef deals with the omission of a major plot point surrounding the Marauder's Map.  No explanation is given as to how Professor Lupin knows how to operate it--anyone who has read the book knows that he in fact helped to write it.  This isn't that important in and of itself, but the entire related subplot was left out, and that does seem important.  The fact was that Lupin is a werewolf, and when he was at Hogwarts his friends became Animagi (shape-shifters, essentially) in order to be with him and help control him during the full moon.  That's important because Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew were two of those friends, and no one knew they were Animagi (because it was illegal to become one without registration, so they kept it hidden), which allowed both of them to hide for so long.  This also touches on the stag form that Harry's Patronus charm takes on toward the end of the movie--his dad's Animagus form was a stag, but this was never mentioned.  It was never clear that Black, Pettigrew, and Lupin were all part of the elder Potter's group of friends when they were at school.  On one hand, I think that anyone seeing the movie without reading the book can probably do without all that information.  It doesn't make this particular movie that much less enjoyable, at any rate, although I personally would have been wondering how everyone knew about the damned map if I didn't know from reading the book.  My main concern is how they're going to deal with these plot points if they come up in future films.  It seems impossible that they can continue to leave this stuff out, but maybe they can.  These movies have a fine cast, but sometimes it seems as though the actors are somewhat wasted with as little screen time as they get.  Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall had what amounted to little more than a cameo role in this film, and Alan Rickman as Professor Snape always deserves more screen time.  Emma Thompson did an incredible job as Professor Trelawney, but didn't get to portray some of the better moments in the book.  Hopefully she'll be back for upcoming films.  All of that being said, this movie did a lot of things right.  It was considerably darker than the first two films, but that darkness was offset with an injection of humor.  The acting was great--I singled out a few performers, but the kids in the main roles (Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson) have really gotten a lot better.  Also, this film incorporated several "mood" shots that have been absent before--flowers shrivelling and dying as the dementors pass, and several scenes that incorporate clocks and time.  Pretty cool.  Overall, I would have to say that the film was quite well done, but could have been even better.  I'm very interested to see what they do with the coming films, but  Prisoner of Azkaban  set the bar pretty high.  If they don't continue to improve, I'll be pretty disappointed.

      Something bad happened this morning.  Something that has the potential to be bad, anyway.  I received in my inbox an e-mail from  urlLink lucasarts.com .  George Lucas is the creator of the  Star Wars  films and franchise, and LucasArts is the company that produces related video games and other items.  This e-mail contained an offer to try out  Star Wars Galaxies  for fourteen days, free of charge.   Galaxies  is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG), and I've been interested in it since I first heard it was in development.  I used to play the  Star Wars  Role Playing Game back when the books were published by West End Games and I had a large enough group of local friends to support it.  The thought of a video game based on the same concept, especially one that could be played online, appeals to me a lot.  However, having had friends who have gotten into other MMORPGs, and seeing how their lives were totally consumed by them, I managed to talk myself out of buying  Galaxies  when it came out, and I've managed to hold off until now.  Besides the time-consumption aspect of  Galaxies , I've also stayed away from it because of the cost.  First off, you have to buy the game.  Then there's a subscription fee which is necessary to play the game online.  Of course, it can't be played offline, so if you don't pay the subscription fee, then the software itself is useless.  I'm not a fan of this particular model of payment.  If they're going to charge for the service, then the game itself should be free; or the price of the game should include the subscription.  That's not the way it works, and so I stayed away.  I didn't want to lay out the money for the game to end up not liking it and then never playing it again.  When I saw the offer in my inbox to try it for free for fourteen days, I didn't think much of it at first.  I thought it referred only to the subscription, which didn't make much sense to me as I thought the first thirty days were free anyway.  Once I opened it up and looked at it, though, I saw that my first thought was wrong.  They're actually offering a trial version of the software which will expire in fourteen days, as well as a free subscription for that time span.  Now it seems like I almost have to try it.  Don't I?  I mean, why wouldn't I?  It's totally free for fourteen days, with no obligations--they don't even take your credit card number during the trial period (now I sound like an infomercial).  As much as I've wanted to play this game for so long, I feel like I would be doing myself a disservice if I passed up an opportunity to check it out with absolutely no strings attached.  The danger in that, of course, is if I like it and like it a lot.  I feel like I've shown good restraint so far in staying away from the game, but it could all be for naught.  If I like it, then I'll have to buy the game and purchase a subscription.  At least I'd know going into it that it would be money well spent, though.  You know, I've heard that crack dealers operate like this:  they give you a little taste for free, just to get you hooked.  Then you're a customer for life.

      Last week I had a great idea.  The CD player in my car can play MP3 audio files, and it can also read recordable (CD-R) and rewriteable (CD-RW) CDs.  I have almost my entire CD collection ripped to MP3s, and I also have a sizeable collection of, um, extraneous MP3s, so this is perfect for me.  Each CD can hold about 150 MP3 files, give or take, so I can just burn a bunch of tracks onto one disc as opposed to carrying around a bunch of CDs.  With CD-RWs, I can even use the same physical disc over and over again.  Last Thursday I was getting stuff ready for my trip to Stow, and I decided to burn a disc full of tunes.  I've been listening a lot to the new Velvet Revolver CD I picked up last week, which reminds me at times of Def Leppard.  Being in the mood for that sort of sound, I filled up a disc with all my Def Leppard tunes.  That's quite a few songs.  I've got all the albums from  Pyromania  (1983) to  X  (2002), and a couple of other random songs I've found here and there.  It wasn't enough to fill a disc to the brim, but it was more than enough for two hours of driving.  Let me tell you, Def Leppard makes for some damned fine driving music.  If there was to be only one band to survive the hair-metal purge of the early 90s (brought on by the surge of alternative rock, led by bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam), I wish it could have been Def Leppard instead of Bon Jovi.  I like Bon Jovi, but I think Def Leppard is an altogether better band.  And Def Leppard is still around, still coming out with albums every few years, but their popularity has dropped significantly.  One reason I think Def Leppard is so great is because they're very good at reinventing themselves.  They've done a couple of albums recently ( Slang  and  X ) which have almost an alternative feel to them, with a more typical Def Leppard album ( Euphoria ) sandwiched in between.  All of them are very good.  I also really appreciate the musicianship.  People have a tendency to scoff at bands like this that were popular through the 1980s, but these guys are genuinely good.  Listening to this collection of songs I made, there was no way to tell that most of the songs included a one-armed drummer.  I think the opening riff to "Pour Some Sugar On Me" is one of the greatest rock riffs of all time (also the one sequence I can still play on guitar), and although I might be alone, I think some of the lyrics are well written as well.  Not all of them, but a lot.  I was also pleased to discover that I'm ready once again to embrace the song "Armageddon It."  I had issues with this song for quite some time due to how much it was overplayed on the radio and MTV (when the "M" in MTV actually  meant  something) back when it was popular.  That was in 1988, and it's taken me sixteen years to be able to wholly enjoy the song again.  I still don't really like "Love Bites," though.  I can't believe how much I enjoyed this CD.  I think I'll probably go ahead and put all these songs on a recordable disc and just keep it.  Then I can use the rewriteable disc for something else--maybe a mix of other hair bands popular in the 80s.

      Another weekend in the books, and it was the last weekend of spring.  Today is the first official day of summer, so we can look forward to hot and muggy weather in the days ahead.  Even more importantly, we can now start looking forward to the end of summer and the beginning of football season.  The weekend started innocently enough.  I drove over to Stow after work on Friday, and I arrived at Brandi's apartment right around 7:00.  We hung out and watched TV for a few minutes, and then decided to go to Olive Garden for dinner.  Things started going downhill, I think, when we sat at the bar and ordered wine while we waited for our table.  That ended up being the gateway that led to everything that happened later.  We finished our wine, then had another glass each with dinner.  We felt like having a low-key evening at home afterwards, so we stopped on the way to pick up a couple bottles of wine to share.  To get right to the point, we went home and got drunk.  After that it gets a bit fuzzy, and it's probably better that way.  I think we listened to music.  Brandi told me the next day that we played PlayStation football, and that I managed to score a touchdown.  Mostly we just talked, and by "talked" I mean "chattered like our lips were on fire."  Plenty of embarrassing things were revealed, most of which has now thankfully faded into the mists.  I have no concept of how long this went on, but the evening finally ended with both of us being sick before somehow finding our way to bed.  I don't recover especially well from my rare bouts of drunkenness, and so I stayed in bed until well into the afternoon on Saturday.  I eventually made it out into the wider world, however.  Brandi and I went out shopping.  I bought myself a new cell phone, and I let Brandi pick out a few things for her birthday (which is tomorrow).  Then we just hung out at her place for most of the evening, with a quick trip out for ice cream.  That was a nice antidote for our Friday-night antics.  Sunday was pretty similar.  We slept in (I think I finally got out of bed around noon) and then went to the grocery to get some stuff for that night's dinner.  We stopped at Wendy's to pick up lunch on the way back.  After we ate, we took a pretty significant nap.  When we got up, Brandi started making dinner while I played video games, and we watched  Wayne's World  as we ate.  Later on that evening, we went out to see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  again.  Since I had to come to work this morning, we couldn't stay up too long after we got home.  Tonight, though, Brandi is coming to my place in Bowling Green.  She'll be in town for her birthday and for a few job interviews, and I think I'll probably end up at her place again next weekend.  I probably won't be doing any drinking for a while, though.

      I had a pretty productive day yesterday.  Here's how I fared on the list I made for myself:   Air conditioner is fixed, and I got a key for Brandi.  I did not get an oil change, because the place was too busy.  I'll get one before I get on the road today.  I got the stuff I needed from Wal-Mart.  I didn't do all the dishes, but I did most of them.  Most of what's left is just cups, and most of those only had water in them anyway.  The trash is gone.  The bills are paid.  Exercise was done.  My bag is in my car, ready to go.  I even remembered the concert tickets, which were far and away the most important items.  I did do some creative writing.  I didn't work on the story I talked about, but managed to do some other writing.  The story I mentioned will be worked on this weekend.  I missed my 1:00 a.m. deadline for getting in bed by fifteen minutes.  However, I overslept by half an hour this morning, so it evened out.

      As part of my recent rededication to my creative writing craft, I've been thinking about submitting work for possible publication.  I've sent pieces out before to be considered by various small literary magazines, but it's been a while.  I haven't had anything published yet, and if it's ever going to happen I need to get back on the horse and start trying to get my work out there to be read.  To that end, yesterday I pulled out and dusted off a copy of one of my old stories.  It's a piece I like a lot, and I think of it as being the most publication-worthy of anything I've written so far.  I originally wrote it for a fiction workshop during my undergrad days, and I hadn't looked at it for quite a while.  Just opening it up and reading through it again was an interesting experience since it was originally written over four years ago.  There were some parts through the beginning of the story that made me cringe, and I wondered how I had ever thought this piece was anywhere near worthy of being published.  I almost quit reading, but I made myself go all the way through it.  I'm glad I did.  Granted, much of the middle of the story is bloated and probably mostly unnecessary, but overall the piece is good.  Granted, it needs some work.  I've made some minor changes to it already, but I haven't yet touched the offending middle part that needs a severe overhaul.  That may be my writing project for this evening, actually.  I want to streamline it, to make sure that everything I include is absolutely relevant and it all flows well.  This process may include just deleting a significant section from the middle and essentially rebuilding that part of the story, but that's fine if it's what I have to do.  The rest of the story is good, and if I can tighten up the parts that aren't so good, then I can start submitting this story with confidence.  What pleased me the most about the whole experience was how quickly I regained a feel for the story, despite how long it had been since I had worked on it or even read it.  I immediately remembered what it was I had been trying to do with the piece.  Even better, I immediately saw ways that I could enhance my initial ideas, and some other minor changes I could make to bring out other elements.  I can't even express how great it felt to get started on editing this piece.  By making just a few minor changes, I think I was really able to enhance the story and make it more focused.  That will help me as I do the more major revisions, as I can keep in mind exactly where I need to go.  I now have a better feel for what's necessary and what's not, and hopefully I'll be able to do some work on it this evening and come out with a tight piece of fiction.  All of this has really given me some confidence about where I am as a writer.  As I mentioned the other day, I haven't been writing much fiction for a while, and I'm at least a little surprised that I slipped back into it so easily after being away.  In that time, though, I've been reading more extensively than I ever have before (which is saying something), and doing other kinds of writing (such as this blog).  I'm just glad to discover that these things have helped me to grow as a writer, and that I'm not just stagnating.  Of course, nothing will help foster more growth like actually doing more writing, so that's my next step.  For the first time in a while, I'm looking forward to it.

      No, not here at work, although that would be a nice change.  I do have a lot of stuff I need to get done this evening, though, since I'm leaving for the weekend immediately after work tomorrow afternoon.  Here's a checklist:   Call landlord about air conditioner, and also to get a key for Brandi.  Get an oil change.  Visit Wal-Mart for several items.  Wash dishes.  Take out the trash.  Pay bills.  Run, or do some other type of exercise.  Get stuff together for weekend trip.  Write!  (Today is July 1!)  Actually, now that I have it all listed out, it doesn't sound too bad at all.  That's why I do this from time to time.  It feels like a lot when I'm just thinking about it.  Listing it out helps me realize it's doable, and it also keeps me from forgetting anything.  I'd also like to get to bed relatively early--I'm thinking no later than 1:00 a.m.  Yes, that's early for me (it's usually 2:00, although last night it was just past 3:00).  I know I'll be up late tomorrow night, as Brandi and I are going to a concert in Cleveland, so it would be good to be rested for that.  Since I mentioned work way up there in the first paragraph, I thought I'd throw out a little tidbit about my day here so far.  Our marketing director actually showed up today.  This is the second time she's been here in, oh, the past month or so.  She came in an hour late, and so far hasn't made it past the lobby, where she's currently chatting away.  I also might mention that she brought her daughter, as she does from time to time, and her daughter also brought a friend.  I'm not sure when construction is going to start on the new day-care wing we're apparently going to open, but I'll let you know.  Additionally, while our office manager was showing someone around our office earlier this week, she introduced me as a "Manufacturing Engineer."  Wow.  That will look nice on my résumé, don't you think?  I can list my title here as "Manufacturing Engineer/Purchasing Manager."  I've got a couple of pretty impressive titles for someone who's only making $22K per year.

      My fellow Americans, it came to my attention this morning that today is the last day to cast votes for Major League Baseball's All-Star Game, which takes place on July 13 in Houston.  Having nothing else to do, I did my patriotic duty and submitted my ballot twenty-five times, which is the maximum number you're allowed.  Here's how I voted:      Pos.    American League    National League     C  Ivan Rodriguez, Detroit  Charles Johnson, Colorado    1B  Paul Konerko, Chicago  Sean Casey, Cincinnati    2B  Alfonso Soriano, Texas  Jeff Kent, Houston    3B  Hank Blalock, Texas  Scott Rolen, St. Louis    SS  Carlos Guillen, Detroit  Barry Larkin, Cincinnati    OF  Dmitri Young, Detroit  Adam Dunn, Cincinnati    OF  Vladimir Guerrero, Anaheim  Ken Griffey Jr., Cincinnati    OF  Manny Ramirez, Boston  Wily Mo Peña, Cincinnati     There are at least a few odd choices on there, I'll readily admit.  Let me go through my rationale for some of them.  For one thing, being a Reds fan, I'm not nearly as familiar with the American League as I am with the National League.  I had to look at stats to pick players at a couple of positions, especially in the infield.  It turns out that Texas has a really good infield, so I picked their players at three out of four positions.  My strangest American League selection has to be Dmitri Young of the Detroit Tigers.  I know he was on the disabled list for a good portion of the season, and I honestly don't know how well he's doing since then.  I do know that he hit a game-winning home run last night.  I also know that he's been one of my favorite players for a long time.  He played for the Reds for several years, but I liked him even before that, when he played for St. Louis.  I remember watching him when he first came up with St. Louis, and he was so much fun to watch.  I was psyched when the Reds got him, and disappointed when they got rid of him.  I don't think he'll end up in the All-Star game, but he earned my votes a long time ago.  Moving on to the National League side, the first thing you'll notice is that I voted for Charles Johnson at the catcher position instead of the easy choice, Mike Piazza.  Piazza's having a good year, I like him as a player, and the Mets are my second-favorite team behind the Reds.  So what gives?  Well, Piazza has only played half his games this year as a catcher, playing the other half at first base.  Johnson is an awesome defensive catcher, and he's having a pretty solid year offensively as well.  Piazza is going to win the voting and be the starting catcher, but it would be nice to see Johnson on the team as well.  The second thing about my National League ballot is that it's laden with players from the Reds.  Let's go through them.  First base is a loaded position in the National League.  Jim Thome of the Phillies leads the majors in home runs.  Albert Pujols of the Cardinals is just awesome, a great all-around player.  Piazza plays there when he's not catching.  It would be hard to make a bad choice here.  My votes go to Casey.  For one thing, he's one of my favorite players.  More objectively, he's been leading the league in batting average for most of the season, and he's probably the team MVP so far.  I doubt he'll get enough votes to earn the start, but I would be very surprised if he's not on the All-Star team as a reserve.  The National League doesn't have the star power at shortstop like the American League does, but there are some solid players.  Edgar Renteria (St. Louis) and Adam Kennedy (Houston) are currently leading a very tight race, but I would love to see Barry Larkin win it.  This is the last year in an illustrious career for him, and it would be awesome to see him get one more place in the Midsummer Classic.  It's not a mercy vote, either, as he's been playing well and has been a large part of Cincinnati's success so far this season.  I seriously doubt he's going to win the voting, but I do hope they can find a place for him on the team.  I filled my outfield ballot with Reds players.  The vote for Griffey needs no explanation.  I don't think a vote for Adam Dunn is much of a stretch--he's second in the league in home runs, and probably in walks as well.  I know, however, that Wily Mo Peña hasn't got a chance in hell of making the team, even as a reserve.  I needed a third choice, though--I don't think Sosa is deserving this year, and I'll never vote for Bonds.  Peña is most definitely  not  the most deserving outfielder after those guys, but I'd really just like to see him participate in the Home Run Derby.  He can hit the ball a long way.  Voting is open until midnight tonight.  Click  urlLink here  to vote.

      With no further ado, I'd like to announce the newest addition to my blog,  urlLink The Yawp's Links Page .  You can find it permanently linked over on the right.  It's a pretty straightforward page of links to pages that I like or find useful, or pages for things that I like.  Feel free to explore.  As with most of my pages, I'm still tweaking it a little bit--I'm trying to liven it up with some useless but hopefully amusing info.  Right now I'm sitting on my living room floor, watching the Reds game on television (they're losing 7-4 in the 9th) while writing this with my laptop.  It's really hot--it feels like the flesh on top of my legs is about to boil away.  Not good times.  Also, my laptop sucks.  It's about four years old now, and it's seen some hard use.  Also, it's running Windows ME.  Need I say more?  I'd really like to get a new one, but that's not in the cards for the foreseeable future.  As long as I can coax this one into working on the rare occasions when I actually feel like doing some work away from my desk, I think I'll be okay.  I'm thinking about switching over to a wireless network soon.  I currently have two desktop computers (one of which is being used essentially as a file server) and this laptop.  Once Brandi moves in, that will add another laptop to the equation.  Going wireless would let us set up a nice little network without stringing cable all over the place.  It would also make our laptops more useful, as we could use them wherever we wanted without having to worry about how long the cables are.  She and I are moving into a new apartment in about a month and a half, and that seems like the perfect time to make the switch.  I'm not saying I'll definitely do it, but it does make sense.  It's pretty warm in my apartment right now.  The air conditioning hasn't been working since sometime this weekend.  It hasn't mattered that much since the weather has been so nice, but it's definitely a little toasty right now.  Of course, having my laptop act as a space heater certainly isn't helping anything.  I need to call my landlords tomorrow anyway, to get a key for Brandi for the rest of the summer, so I'll let them know about it then.  I know the girl who lives downstairs told them about it this weekend, but apparently they decided not to do anything about it.  The game is over now, and the Reds have lost 9-5 to the Mets.  They also announced that right fielder Austin Kearns needs surgery on his injured thumb and will be out for 4-6 weeks.  That's bad news for the Reds, but hopefully Wily Mo Peña will be placed out there regularly to give him a chance to show what he can do.  He's shown a lot of improvement already this year--there's no doubt the kid can hit.  If he can realize his potential, it'll be a great situation for the Reds.

      Seeing as how I've already done a certain amount of barking about the upcoming Presidential election, I thought I should take a moment to explain my stance on politics.  It's a pretty hot topic these days, and I read a pretty fair amount about it due mainly just to my extensive blog surfing.  To boil it all down, it just seems like everyone hates everyone else.  Liberals/Democrats hate Conservatives/Republicans, and vice versa, and each group thinks the other will be the downfall of civilization as we know it.  That level of extremism bothers me.  Truth is, we need both sides.  If either side gained enough power to make the other insignificant, that would be very bad.  Our entire governmental system is based on checks and balances, and this is one area where that comes into effect.  Either side would rage out of control if given an inordinate amount of power over the other.  It just wouldn't work.  Personally, I don't care that much.  Sure, I have a tendency to align more as a Liberal/Democrat, and I'm in fact registered as a Democrat, but I don't think of myself that way.  I refuse to vote for someone just because of their party affiliation.  I'll vote for whomever I think will do the best job in a given position.  If it happens to be a Republican, so what?  I would have voted for Bob Dole over Al Gore, had they been running against each other.  I like Bob Dole; I just didn't think he would have been a better President than Bill Clinton.  I voted for Gore over Bush not just because Gore was the Democratic candidate, but because I thought he would do a better job than Bush.  I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I don't invest anything in my votes.  I don't take it personally.  I think a lot of people do, and that's why there's so much vitriolic bickering between liberals and conservatives.  I don't care.  If a person gets voted into office and does a good job, I think that's great!  It doesn't matter to me if it's the person I voted for or not.  His/her ideas don't have to be the same as mine.  If they work, and make things better, I'm all for it.  I don't know how common that sort of view is, though.  I think too many people side with a candidate or party, and then stick with that view no matter what.  If things go badly, they don't see it, or rationalize it to themselves and others.  I'm sure I'm guilty of that from time to time as well, but I try to step back and look at things objectively.  If someone is doing or will do a good job, I think they should get the job no matter what party they represent.  Of course, there will be plenty of varying opinions on exactly what constitutes a "good job," and that's a totally different discussion.  That's the sort of thing that can make political debate interesting, though.  I'm normally not into politics because it gets so personal, which drives me crazy, but if it could be more about philosophies and ideas, I would definitely be more interested.  This November, I'll be voting for John Kerry.  I don't necessarily think that he'll be the greatest President who has ever lived, but I do think he's a better candidate than George W. Bush.  I'm sure Mr. Bush means well, but it doesn't seem that his policies are helping the United States, either at home or abroad.  It may be that Mr. Kerry would be no better, but at the very least I think we need a change of direction.

      Getting to work was a serious pain this morning.  There was an accident on I-475, and traffic was backed up for several miles.  I ended up getting off an exit before I usually do and just taking a different way around, but I was still delayed by probably twenty minutes.  Then a traffic signal at a major intersection was having issues, just blinking instead of functioning normally, which turned that intersection into a two-way stop.  Unfortunately, I was on the street that had to stop, and of course, I needed to make a left.  That also took some time.  I finally made it though and found, wonder of wonders, that I actually have a few things to do this morning.  Nothing major, but at this point, I'm not complaining.  It was a nice weekend, if not particularly busy or exciting.  Brandi was wiped out when she got to BG, so she pretty much just crawled into bed and stayed there until late Saturday morning.  I didn't do much more myself.  I went out to dinner that evening with my friends McComas and Charissa.  We ate at a Japanese place in BG.  I hadn't had Japanese food for a long time, so it was quite an experience.  I liked it, though.  I had grilled chicken in a mustard sauce, and it was really good.  I also tried sushi for the first time, which I think is really impressive considering I don't generally like seafood even when it's cooked.  It was okay, but I doubt I'll ever have the desire to eat it again.  On Saturday Brandi and I went for a walk along the bike trail in BG.  I had never been on it before, and it's really nice.  We exercised for a bit after that, then went to the mall where I ate pizza while Brandi got a manicure.  I napped for a little bit when we got home, then that evening we went up to a Mexican place called Loma Linda's for dinner.  Brandi's friend Rachel just graduated from cosmetology school, so she had a little get-together up there, which was fun.  On Sunday, I slept in until just after noon, while Brandi got up and messed around for a while.  After I got up, we went to the grocery store to get a few things.  We just watched TV and a movie after we got back, then we broke out the grill that Brandi got for her birthday last week.  It was the first time for both of us--I've grilled food before, but never participated in the whole process from start to finish.  We did hamburgers and hot dogs, though, and it turned out really well.  After dinner we started cleaning up a bit and prepping my apartment for Brandi to move in.  She found out on Friday that she'll be starting her new job on July 6, which is next Tuesday, so a big part of her stuff will be arriving at my/our place this weekend.  The rest of the evening was spent mostly on the couch.  I played PlayStation football for a while, and then Brandi and I watched a movie ( Spider-Man ) before going to bed.  Next weekend won't be nearly as calm and laid-back as this one was.  I'm driving over to Brandi's place on Friday evening, and we're going to a concert that night in Cleveland.  We'll stay over at her place that night, then load up our cars and drive back to BG on Saturday.  Once there, we'll offload her stuff into my apartment, then head down to Troy for the remainder of the weekend.  July 4 is my 27th birthday, so we always have a big family get-together at my parents' house, and then go to the fireworks that evening.  Also, we'll have to find some time in there somewhere to see Spider-Man 2, which comes out this Wednesday...if I don't go see it on opening night, that is.

       urlLink Money talks: Boozer, Jazz agree on $68M deal   This is a bad situation for the Cavs.  Here's what happened, as I understand it.  The Cavs could have picked up Boozer's contract for about $700,000, which is quite low for a player of his caliber.  That being the case, they decided to decline the option and let Boozer become a free agent, with the understanding that they would sign him to a long-term contract at a much higher salary.  They couldn't actually sign the deal until later this month due to NBA rules, and other offers started coming to Boozer as soon as he became a free agent.  The Cavs could only offer so much due to the salary cap, and other teams were able and willing to offer more.  The end result is that Boozer signed an offer sheet with the Utah Jazz, and will officially sign with them later this month unless the Cavs can find a way to match the offer.  It's unlikely they can, so the Cavs are essentially letting Boozer go without getting anything in return.  Last year was Boozer's second season in the league, and he came on strong.  He averaged double figures in scoring and rebounds, and became a fan favorite in Cleveland.  This is something that few people expected after he was drafted in the second round out of Duke University.  He showed the ability to be quite a force at power forward, and I'm sure he figured in the Cavs long-term plans.  Their willingness to waive the last year of his original contract and sign him to a better deal shows their recognition of his importance to the Cleveland franchise.  This was an act of good faith on their part, a reward to Boozer for playing so well under a small contract.  He went back on the agreement when he saw the larger offers on the table.  The Cavs were offering around $40 million, which is a pretty sizeable chunk of change.  The offer from the Jazz, though, is for $68 million.  The disparity in those two figures makes it hard to fault Boozer for taking the better deal.  Still, if he made an agreement with the Cavs, he should honor it.  That's the only reason he's a free agent right now, after all.  In reality, the fault for this mess probably lies with the Cavs for taking Boozer at his word.  For trusting him.  That's sad, but probably true.  They shouldn't have cut him loose until such time as they could immediately re-sign him to the bigger deal, with no time in between for other teams to nose their way into the bidding.  I don't know all the NBA rules, so I don't know if that's possible.  If it wasn't possible, then they should have made him honor his "small" contract for next year.  They could have negotiated a longer, more lucrative deal over the course of the year, or at the very least they could have traded him and gotten something in return.  Now they have to try to find a power forward that will approach the contribution that Boozer made over the past two seasons.  It seems that honesty is something of an outdated concept in the world of sports.  Everything revolves around the almighty dollar.  I can't blame just the players, either, because I'm sure there are just as many examples of team management going back on their word.  A couple of years ago, after the Reds fired Jack McKeon as manager and were searching for a replacement, they offered the job to Ron Oester.  Thinking the offer was solid and that they were in negotiations, Oester asked for a higher salary.  The next thing you know, the Reds had hired Bob Boone to manage the team without even making a counteroffer to Oester.  Lately, there's been some talk about Thad Matta, the new head basketball coach at Ohio State.  He left the same position at Xavier University to take the OSU job about a week after saying publicly that he was not a candidate.  You don't expect a person to publicize the fact that they're seeking a new job while they currently have another one, of course, but he definitely could have worded it differently so that it didn't sound like an outright denial.  It makes the person look bad, and can create a lot of tension if that person does indeed take a different job.  This leads, of course, to the case of Urban Meyer.  I'm still at least a little bitter about this, and I'm not the only one.  Coach Meyer was hired in 2000 to be the head coach of BGSU's football program after the resignation of Gary Blackney.  He was an instant success, bringing high-profile victories, national rankings, and a winning atmosphere to the Falcon program.  He was even more emphatic than Matta, saying after the 2002 season that you'd have to "pry him out of [Bowling Green] with a crowbar."  I couldn't find that exact quote in  urlLink this article , but you can read it and get a general sense of how certain it was that he was sticking around for a while.  You can then read the  urlLink announcement that he was leaving  for another job, dated one week later.  The moral of these stories?  Simply put, almost everyone is looking out for number one, and you can't take at face value any statement that implies otherwise.  "Gentlemen's agreements" aren't worth anything anymore, and statements to the press have to be taken with a grain of salt.  This isn't true across the board, but taking someone at their word is an invitation to get burned.  It isn't limited to the sports world, either.  If you don't have something in writing, you don't necessarily have an agreement.  Sad but true.

       urlLink Report shows big drop in reading   I heard something about this on Paul Harvey's show while I was in Subway this afternoon, and I managed to find an article about it online.  Basically, what it boils down to is this:  even among people who  can  read, a whole lot of people  don't  read.  The report says that only 57% of Americans are readers.  A couple of years ago, a friend of mine told me that she would prefer to read a textbook or something like that over a work of fiction.  I was utterly shocked by that, and literally speechless for a moment.  It's something I couldn't imagine, but apparently the sentiment isn't that uncommon.  Only 47% of the population reads fiction.  That in itself is an alarming trend for me.  I'm such an avid reader, I can't imagine what it must be like to go without it.  Also, as I mention from time to time, I'm a writer of fiction myself, with hopes of eventually being published--although my hopes have diminished somewhat, I'd still  love  to make it a career.  If people aren't reading, though, it becomes even less likely.  There has to be a market, after all.  All of this is one reason I was so enthusiastic about the  Harry Potter  phenomenon, even before I had read any of the books myself.  I thought it was great that there was so much excitement over a series of books.  It's introducing the younger generation to the joys of reading, and I also think it has brought a number of adults back to reading as well.  Not enough, apparently, but every little bit helps.  The same goes for Oprah Winfrey's book club.  If it gets people to read, I'm all for it.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who will hear about this report and pass its findings off as no big deal.  After all, why does it matter if people are reading or not?  They're obviously getting elsewhere whatever it is that people get from books.  I would disagree with this assessment, and I've got three reasons right off the top of my head.  1) Imagination.  Sure, in the cases of a lot of books, you can just wait for the movie to come out and go see that instead.  It's not the same, though.  Reading a book forces a person to come up with their own images of the characters, settings, and events within, instead of seeing someone else's depiction.  This fosters imagination and creativity, both of which sometimes seem to be lacking in today's society.  Without these things, life can be pretty dry and stagnant.  America used to be known for ingenuity and creativity, but it doesn't seem like that's the case anymore.  Reading can help bring that back.  2) Knowledge.  I'm pretty good at  Jeopardy!  and other trivia games, and it's almost entirely because of how much I read.  You learn things all the time when you read, even from fiction.  It seeps in, and it often sticks because you're not trying to learn.  Being good at trivia games is no big deal, but having broad general knowledge definitely comes in handy.  3) Writing skills.  Reading grants a person a familiarity with English in its written form, and that will greatly improve their own writing skills.  I'm certain that the main reason my own grammar and writing is so technically sound is because I read a lot as I grew up, and continue to do so.  I see a lot of bad writing on a daily basis, and it drives me crazy.  The main point of writing is communication of ideas, but ideas get lost in bad writing.  Even someone who doesn't write for a living per se needs to be able to effectively communicate.  For a society where e-mail is one of the most common forms of communication, the ability to write well is highly underrated and undervalued.  The article lists the internet as one reason for the decline in reading, and I have to say that's at least partially unfair.  After all, e-mail and the web are highly dependent on the written word, so that's a form of reading in itself.  However, a lot of internet text is unedited and sloppy, and that's not exclusive to message boards and personal sites.  Here's my suggestion:   READ , dammit!  Read anything, even if it's something lame like  Chicken Soup for the Soul ,  Who Moved My Cheese? , or some horrible romance novel.  If you're looking for something better, check out  urlLink my reading page  for some recommendations, and feel free to e-mail me with questions about any of the books listed on there.  If you have kids, read to them!  Don't stop with children's books, either--read poetry to them, and let them learn to love the language.  If they're old enough, have them read to you.  Also, encourage them to read on their own.  Fiction, history, biographies--whatever they're interested in.  If it becomes a part of their routine, it's something you'll never regret.  Check out a used book store.  Get books at garage sales.  Borrow them from friends.  Go to the library.  Download e-books.  Subscribe to a literary magazine.  Join a reading club.  The books are out there.  Go get them!

       I've actually been fairly busy here at work so far this week.  To say that it's been a nice change would be an understatement.  It definitely makes the time go by faster, and I always prefer to feel like I'm actually earning my meager pay.  I think it's going to slow down again shortly, but even a temporary pocket of activity is a good thing.   I will argue vehemently against the idea that any type of card game is a sport, but I cannot deny that the World Series of Poker (as televised by ESPN) makes for extremely compelling television.  I can't explain why, really.  I've never played poker myself, but these guys on TV make it look like anyone can do it.  I know that's not the case, though.  Still, it looks like a lot of fun.  I might see if I can pick it up a little bit.  I don't see myself ever becoming a high-stakes professional gambler, but it would be fun to pretend.   Brandi moved in with me this weekend, and it's causing some technological problems.  I can't get her laptop integrated into my network.  They're all Windows machines, so it shouldn't be a problem.  For some reason, I just can't get her network card to realize that a cable is plugged into it.  I know the cables are good and my router is good.  Whatever I try, I just get the message that the network media is disconnected, and I don't know how to get it to connect.  I worked on it for a couple of hours last night, to no avail.  I do have a couple more ideas, but one of them (uninstalling the integrated network card, hoping WinXP will automatically detect and reinstall it upon reboot) I don't want to do unless there are absolutely no other options.  I'll be seeking input from some technologically minded friends and co-workers, and I'll probably take another whack at it this evening.  I'm probably switching to wireless soon anyway, but it would be nice to have it running in the meantime.  Otherwise, things are going quite well.  Granted, it's very early, but I don't expect any real problems.  Last night we went grocery shopping.  I've never kept many groceries on hand because I don't cook much.  Brandi does, though, so we had to stock up a little bit.  I certainly don't mind.   Speaking of food, I had to spend a little bit too much time waiting in line at Wendy's today.  Wednesday is generally the day I eat healthy at Wendy's, but I can't make myself do it if I have to stand in line for any length of time.  The pictures and smells of beef break down my resolve.  I ended up with a Big Bacon Classic today, and it was outstanding.   I've seen Will Ferrell twice in the past week on late-night talk shows (last week on Letterman; last night on Conan).  I think it's entirely possible that he's the funniest man alive.  The night he was on Letterman, I laughed until I cried, and I was headed that way again last night.  His segment with Conan lost some of its momentum when they pretended to wrestle over a handgun, but it was pretty damned funny before that.  His new movie  Anchorman  comes out this Friday, and I'm sure I'll be seeing it at some point.   The Bowling Green State University Falcon football team will be sporting new uniforms when they take the field this fall.  I got my eyes on a picture of them for the first time this morning, and I must say I'm most definitely less than impressed.  They're orange on orange (home) and white on white (away), with a brown stripe up the length of the side--like the Denver Broncos uniforms, or the Miami Hurricanes.  I guess that means they're in style, but I don't think they work that well with our color scheme.  I'm hoping they'll look better once the players are actually wearing them.   Had the timing been different, I probably would have commented more at length on this situation, but suffice it to say that I'm glad Mike Krzyzewski (pronounced shuh-SHEV-ski; we'll just call him  urlLink Coach K ) decided to turn down the Los Angeles Lakers coaching job and stay at Duke.  He's the consummate college coach.  I think he would have done a good job in the NBA, but I don't think he would have fit nearly as well as he does in college, and at Duke in particular.  His teams are always so well coached and fun to watch.  College basketball really would have lost out if he had decided to leave.  I love the college game, so I'm extremely glad that didn't happen.

      (Well, maybe no wiser.)  I find myself reluctantly at work this morning, after a long weekend which did not satisfy my rest requirements.  Don't get me wrong, it was an awesome weekend.  It was far more active than most, though, and I could have used a little bit more time for sleeping.  I got an early start to the weekend, as I took the afternoon off on Friday.  I went immediately to get an oil change and car wash, then drove through Wendy's to get some lunch before I hit the road for Stow.  After an uneventful drive, I got to Brandi's place in Stow around 2:30.  She was just waking up from a nap, so we just hung out for a little bit.  Shortly thereafter we got up and showered and started getting ready to go up to Cleveland.  We had tickets to see Edwin McCain in concert, and we wanted to have time to eat first.  We managed to make it to Cleveland and into The Flats with a minimum of effort and confustion, which is something of an accomplishment for us.  There's a BW3 right next to the concert venue ( urlLink The Odeon Concert Club ), so that's where we went.  Our timing was really good, too, as we finished up and headed over to get in line just a few minutes before the doors opened for the show.  The concert was awesome.  Getting there when we did allowed us to stake out a spot right in front of the stage.  The opening act was a singer named Maia Sharp, who sings a duet with Edwin on his newest CD.  She was really good.  She started off playing acoustic guitar and singing, and eventually played a mean keyboard and also some soprano saxophone.  She played for about forty-five minutes, and then there was a short intermission before Edwin and his band came on.  They put on a great show, as usual.  We were standing right in front of Larry Chaney, the lead guitarist, and it was really cool to watch him play close up.  He's so good, and he makes it look so easy.  They played for about two hours, and it was a whole lot of fun.  Brandi bought the tickets for my birthday, so that was a heck of a birthday present.  On Saturday we slept in, and then loaded up our cars with a bunch of Brandi's stuff so she could move into my apartment in Bowling Green.  That actually wasn't so bad.  It took us less than an hour to load up both cars and get on the road.  The drive to BG was something of an adventure due to a pretty serious accident on the turnpike that held up traffic for a while, but we made it without any real incidents.  We unloaded once we got there, then cleaned up and got back on the road to head down to my parents' house in Troy for the rest of the weekend.  That evening was fairly uneventful.  Mom had dinner waiting for us when we got there, so we chatted with her and watched the Reds game on TV while we ate.  Brandi and I went out afterwards to check out Troy's new Super Wal-Mart and to get a birthday card for our friend Doug.  We also stopped at Steak N Shake for a milkshake, and went for a drive around town before heading home.  Sunday was the 4th, which also happens to be my birthday.  My parents have always hosted a big family cookout and get-together for the occasion, and this year was no exception.  If we counted correctly later, we had thirty-three people there over the course of the day.  Most of them I don't get to see very often, so I had a lot of fun.  That evening Brandi and I went to the fireworks in Troy with my cousin Mike and his girlfriend Lisa, and we met up with a bunch of family who had been at the house earlier that day.  We were also met by our friends Amy and Doug.  The fireworks show was really good.  It was nice being out there since it stormed last year and we didn't get to see a show on the 4th.  As for birthday gifts, I got a few.  I got some cash, which always comes in handy.  I got a little collectible baseball bear figurine, a Troy Trojans bobblehead, a binoculars/digital camera combo, a picture frame, and some candy.  I also got a sweet autographed 8X10 photo of Ryan Brewer standing in Williams-Brice Stadium.  I'll be framing that and finding a place of honor for it shortly.  We didn't have to work on Monday, so Brandi and I slept in again, then went for a walk when we got up.  Then we went shopping for balloons--it was Doug's birthday, and Amy threw a surprise party for him; we were asked to bring the balloons.  We got those, then headed up to their house to help Amy decorate and then stick around for the party.  That was a pretty good time, and there was plenty of food.  We hung out for a while even after the party was over, and then went with them to the fireworks in Piqua.  Piqua is something of a hick town (a certain number of friends and relations who live there notwithstanding), but they put on a good fireworks show--I guess if there's one thing 'necks know about, it's explosions.  After that, it was time to head back to Bowling Green.  It was close to 12:30 by the time we got back, and I was pretty tired.  I stayed up with Brandi while she did some laundry, then fell asleep pretty quickly.  For once, she didn't have to go back to Stow this morning--I woke her up as I was leaving so she could get ready for her first day at her new job in Toledo.  It'll be nice having her around from now on.  As a bonus, I was the winner of the weekly NASCAR pool here at work (just for the record, I  am not  a NASCAR fan), so I got $20 bucks this morning.  I decided to use part of it to treat myself to Phil Steele's college football preview magazine, since I forgot to bring a book with me for my lunch hour today.  Now, if I could just find time for a nap.

      Wow.&nbsp; Blogger has made some changes, I see.&nbsp; It looks like there are a lot more formatting options now.&nbsp; The toolbar has as many options as a Microsoft Word toolbar, and that's pretty cool.&nbsp; I probably won't use these new options a whole lot, but it's nice having them there if I need/want them.&nbsp; I'm guessing this is why the Blogger website and service was down for two hours one night earlier this week.&nbsp; From what I can see, it was time well spent.  &nbsp;  I originally logged on to talk about something completely different, but since it's politics, I'm more than happy to put it off until later, or maybe even forget about it entirely.&nbsp; Instead, I'll thrill everyone with yet another installment of random thoughts.  &nbsp;   First off, I have to mention how cool it is for Blogger (and Google, the parent company) to offer all this stuff for free.&nbsp; They keep adding stuff that you can do with your blog, and they aren't charging for any of it.&nbsp; Sure, there's that little advertisement at the top of my blog, but I could even get rid of that if I hosted it myself.&nbsp; That little ad--which displays results at least somewhat relevant to the text on the page--is all I have to display to get this cool service for free.&nbsp; In return, they host my site, and provide all these bells and whistles to make it better.&nbsp; Sure, the text itself doesn't take up all that much storage space, but they also host photos and audio.&nbsp; I liked the service when I first signed up in January, and they've improved upon it a whole lot since then.    I'm currently working on another page or two for my blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;They should be up and running sometime in the near future, so keep an eye out for them.&nbsp; I've started some basic work, but they're mostly in the planning stages right now.     One unexpected side effect of having Brandi move into my apartment is that I now--at long last--seem to be able to get myself out of bed and to work on time.&nbsp; I think it's because having someone there makes me conscious of how many times the alarm goes off, since I don't want to disturb her more than necessary.&nbsp; Part of it is also because sometimes our "morning time" has the potential to overlap, so I want to make sure I get up and get out of her way.&nbsp; At any rate, it's an added bonus since I was starting to feel like an idiot for coming to work late every day.    I don't know yet what's on tap for this weekend.&nbsp; I think Brandi might hang out with her friend Rachel at some point tomorrow.&nbsp; I'll probably play a lot of PlayStation.&nbsp; Beyond that, I don't know.&nbsp; I'd really like to get out to see a movie--top candidates are  Spider-Man 2 , which I inexplicably haven't seen yet, and  I, Robot .&nbsp; Other possibilities would be  Anchorman ,  Dodgeball , and  Fahrenheit 9/11 , but those are all quite a bit less likely.      Yesterday I started reading  The Winds of War  by Herman Wouk.&nbsp; It was recommended to me by Brandi's stepmom, so I thought I'd give it a try.&nbsp; It's a WWII story, and WWII fascinates me.&nbsp; I like it so far, but I'm only a couple of pages into it.&nbsp; It was easy to get into.&nbsp; It's definitely going to take me a while to get through it, though.&nbsp; It's a thick book, and the text is densely packed.&nbsp; Also, it's my lunchtime book, so I'll only be dedicating about 30 minutes per day to it (give or take) through the week.    Speaking of books, I still haven't picked up  My Life  by Bill Clinton.&nbsp; I really do intend to read it at some point, as Mr. Clinton also fascinates me.&nbsp; I'm just a little burned out by the whole political thing right now, so I haven't gotten around to it.

      Playing so much NCAA Football 2005 over the past couple of days has definitely put me in a football mood.  As such, I thought I'd share some football-related happenings.  Doyt Perry Stadium, which is BGSU's football venue, is getting a new scoreboard and sound system.  This was a needed move, as the scoreboard was old (actually, the oldest in Division IA college football) and outdated and the sound system had some problems.  Work on the project started this week, and is planned to be finished by mid-August.  BG's first home football game is on September 11 against Southeast Missouri State, so the new board will be ready by then.  Here's a look at the top of the new scoreboard:   urlLink     Yep, it's big.  You'll notice that it's resting on a semi's flatbed, so that should give you an idea of just how big it is.  When the whole thing goes up, it'll be 36' X 36', give or take a few inches.  The main feature will be a video board, which should definitely enhance the game experience.  I'm looking forward to seeing how they use it.  It's rumored that the first use of it will be to invite fans into the stadium and show the BG @ Oklahoma game, which takes place a week prior to the home opener.  If they do that, I'll be there.  As the scoreboard project progresses, I'll try to make it over to the Doyt to snap some more pictures.  In the meantime, some more pictures can be found  urlLink here .

      After yesterday's unexpected absense from work, I'm back in the saddle this morning.  Here's how the whole thing went down yesterday.  At 7:30 a.m. I woke up briefly to call the office and leave a message saying that my car was in the shop and that I would be there as soon as I could, provided my car was ready at some point during the day.  Then I went back to bed.  At 10:30 a.m. I got a phone call from the guy who was working on my car.  He said the ignition coil needed to be replaced, and he told me how much that would cost.  I told him to go ahead with it, and he said it would take maybe a couple of hours.  At this point, I figured I might still be able to make it to work for half a day if they got the car back to me fairly quickly.  After the phone call, Brandi and I got out of bed and started our day.  Around 1:00 p.m. I got another call from the mechanic.  He said he had replaced the ignition coil and that the check engine light had turned off, but he hadn't been able to make it stop stalling.  He said he had some other things he needed to check, but he would call back as soon as he had more info.  At 3:00 p.m. Brandi left for work.  I knew at this point that I would have to walk over to Midas when my car was ready, but that was fine since it's only a couple of miles away from my apartment.  I decided to put my day off to good use, so I turned on my PlayStation and dived into NCAA Football 2005.  At 6:00 p.m. (still playing football) I called Midas to get an update on my car.  They close at 7:00, and since I would have to walk I wanted to find out if it would be ready by that time so I could head over there.  The mechanic said he still hadn't found the problem, and that he could probably have it diagnosed by 7:00 but it wouldn't be ready.  I wasn't totally thrilled about leaving my car there for another night, but I needed to get this stuff taken care of, so I said that would be fine.  At 6:35 p.m. I got another call from Midas.  The mechanic said he wasn't sure if he had  corrected  the problem or not, but somehow he had gotten the stalling problem to cease.  I headed out of the apartment as quickly as I could, and literally ran to Midas.  I wasn't entirely sure I could make it in time, but I needed to get my car back if I could.  I got there at 6:55, out of breath and dripping.  I have to give Midas credit.  The price they charged me was exactly what they said it would be on the phone at 10:30 that morning.  Whatever they did after replacing the ignition coil was done free of charge.  The guys who work there are really cool, too.  I have no problem going in there when I have car trouble.  At any rate, I drove home and my car seemed to be fine.  I don't know what they did, and it doesn't sound like they do either, but it worked.  At least so far.  I got home a little after 7:00 and went right back to playing PlayStation, where I stayed for most of the rest of the evening.  My friend McComas came over around 10:00 to check the game out.  Brandi got home from work around 11:00, so we ordered food and the three of us hung out around the PlayStation and talked about football.  Does life get any better?  This evening will probably be similar once I get home from work.  Brandi won't be home from work until around 11:00, so I'll probably fire up the PlayStation within seconds of walking in the door.  I'll put the Reds game on the other TV at 7:00 so I can keep one eye on that while I play.  I'm hoping to finish up my first season tonight so I can check out the recruiting feature and see how it's changed from last year's version of the game.  Of course, I do have other stuff that I probably  should  get to tonight.  Whether it happens or not remains to be seen.  I should mention that I didn't miss anything by not coming to work yesterday.  There was nothing new in my inbox and no voice mails either.  Apparently the only thing I missed was a visit from a salesman that I really don't like much anyway, so that's actually a good thing.  I'm glad about this, because I felt a little bad about missing the whole day.  I shouldn't, since we haven't been busy lately anyway, but I did.  Now that my car saga seems to have ended, I'm going to try really hard to get back to my normal blogging style and not include quite so much boring detail from my own daily life.

      It's 1:30 p.m., and I never quite made it to work today.  I've mentioned a couple of times that I've been having some car problems lately.  Today my car is getting worked on, so hopefully those problems will go away.  On my way home from work yesterday--actually, my way home from Best Buy, after buying NCAA Football 2005--my check engine light came on.  Occasional stalling wasn't that huge of a deal, but I wasn't about to mess around with the check engine light.  I went to Midas here in Bowling Green.  Unfortunately, it was close to closing time for them, so I had to leave it overnight.  They still have it.  I got a call a little while ago, and they told me they had managed to make the check engine light go off, but they still haven't solved the stalling problem.  Whatever.  As long as they fix it, it'll be worth missing a day of work.  Not that missing a day of work is a bad thing, but missing a day of pay on next week's paycheck is a little more significant.  My Dad is the kind of guy who goes through new vehicles on a fairly frequent basis.  We laugh about it, but I think incidents like this are a big reason why he does it.  Vehicle maintenance can be a real pain.  Hopefully when I get my car back, it'll be ready to be dependable for a while longer, at least until I can afford to start looking at new ones.  I have no idea when that will be.  Of course, since I can't go anywhere, that gives me plenty of time to play my new video game.

      Anyone wishing to contact me, I suggest you do it in the next forty-five minutes or so.  That's about how long it will take me to get to Best Buy to get my copy of NCAA Football 2005, and then drive home and start playing it.  Once that point is reached, my social life will be mostly over for the forseeable future.  I get lost in these games each year, and if the early reviews are any indication, this version blows its predecessors out of the water by a considerable margin.  I'm looking forward to it very much.  I called Best Buy a few minutes ago to confirm that they actually have copies, and it sounded like the clerk may have fielded a few similar calls today.  The conversation went something like this:   CLERK:   Thank you for calling Best Buy, how may I help you?  ME:   Hi, I was wondering if you have any copies of NC-  CLERK:   Yes, we have them for all systems.  ::click::

       Today I'm on a mission to find myself a copy of NCAA Football 2005 for PlayStation 2.  There are a couple of shops in the area that may have it, so I'll probably call them or stop by those places on my lunch break.  If that fails, there are a couple other places I may check on the way home this evening.  I may not die if I don't get it today, but then again I may.  You never know about these things.   The purchase of a new video game that I'm certain to be addicted to probably spells the end of the line for Galaxies.  I started playing it last Wednesday and it has failed to capture my attention the way I thought it would.  That's probably a good thing, actually, given the cumulative cost of a game subscription.  Being addicted to football is much cheaper--all I have to pay for is the game itself, and I think that's true even if I decide to play it online.  If I need a  Star Wars  video game fix, I can always pick up Knights of the Old Republic.   I walked into the copy room this morning to see our office manager sweeping up flecks of dried mud, which have been falling off the shoes of one of our engineers all morning.  Said engineer was standing in the room, watching her do it.  What in the hell is wrong with people here?  If I'm that engineer and I'm responsible for the dirt all over the floor, there's no way I'm watching someone sweep it up for me.  If I'm the office manager, there's no way I'm sweeping it up when the person responsible for it is right there.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.   Speaking of going crazy, my downstairs neighbor apparently went a little crazy on Brandi this morning and confronted her in the parking lot for playing music at 8:00 in the morning.  She called Brandi some names and said she was going to call the landlords on us.  Um, okay.  Considering that I've lived in the building for over three years and never had a complaint before, and also considering that I've lived above this particular person for over a year with no prior issues, I doubt our landlord will make much of an issue over it.  Especially since this neighbor has never come up and asked us to keep it down or anything, and instead decided to just freak out.  We're reasonable people, and pretty nice too (at least usually)--had she asked, I'm sure Brandi would have just turned down the music if it was too loud.   My running commentary on the Home Run Derby was fun, but probably could have been done better.  It was overlong, but then again so was the event.  I got distracted as it went on, which is why my commentary (particularly on the final round) kind of faded out.  Still, it was my first try, and I'm sure I'll do better if I do something like that again.

      Sitting here in my living room, preparing to watch the Major League Baseball Home Run Derby, I thought I’d keep a running commentary to post online.   urlLink The Sports Guy  does stuff like this from time to time, and it looks like fun.  Maybe it’ll suck, but hey, I don’t have to post it if it does.   8:05 p.m.  – I’m expecting the Derby to start about now, but I’m wrong.  I shouldn’t be surprised.  These "big events" never start on time.  Instead, Roger Clemens is introducing a performance by Clay Walker.  I take this opportunity to flip through the channels.   8:07 p.m.  – Yes, I’m really watching Bill O’Reilly and Newt Gingrich.  Even these blowhards are preferable to country music.   8:11 p.m.  – Back to the Derby, and now they’re doing introductions.  Ugh, can we just get to the homers, please?  It was cool to hear a nice ovation for Ken Griffey Jr., though, even though he isn’t participating in this year’s Derby due to a hamstring tear sustained this past weekend.   8:15 p.m.  – Now they’re bringing out all living members of the 500 Home Run Club.  Willie McCovey was literally wheeled out onto the field in a wheelchair.  Why do we do this to these people?  On the other hand, here’s Mark McGwire, who looks as though he should still be playing.  Except for the white in his goatee, that is.   8:17 p.m.  – That leads me into a rant that’s been building for some time.  I’ll keep it short for now, but I may explore it again later.  What’s up with great athletes I actually like retiring before it seems like they should?  Barry Sanders and Mark McGwire...I would have loved to see these guys play for another few years.  Barry Bonds, on the other hand, refuses to go away, no matter how much I want him to.   8:22 p.m.  – Is the Derby starting to be like the Super Bowl?  I’ve already seen a new Budweiser commercial and a new MasterCard commercial.  Both were pretty funny.  This could be an unexpected bonus.   8:26 p.m.  – Here comes the first pitch.  This event was  supposed  to start at 8:00.  Yep, should have known better.  Oh, they’re pretending to intentionally walk Bonds, how clever.  I hope Bonds screws up his swing in this thing and never hits another home run.  Are they using softballs for this thing?  Also, why can’t they just use the camera angle they normally use for baseball games?   8:32 p.m.  – Okay, I don’t like Bonds (you may have noticed), but even I have to admit that he was fun to watch.  He crushed some balls.  He finishes with seven in the first round.  Oh, right.  I just remembered, they have commercials after each batter in this thing.  Get comfy, folks, we’re likely to be here until morning.   8:35 p.m.  – Here comes Hank Blalock, third baseman for the Texas Rangers.  I’m putting the over/under on this guy at four, and taking the under.   8:39 p.m.  – Blalock finishes with three.  I’m thinking that won’t carry him into the second round.   8:42 p.m.  – After another spate of commercials, here comes Lance Berkman, outfielder for the Astros.  He’s playing in his home park and should be comfortable, so I’m guessing he’ll do well.  He’s only in this contest because Griffey had to pull out.  I really wanted to see Junior do this thing again.  It kills me that he’s injured again.   8:44 p.m.  – I was right about Berkman.   8:46 p.m.  – Well, Berkman started strong, but wore down after that.  He finishes with seven, currently tied with Bonds for the lead.   8:52 p.m.  – Next up is Miguel Tejada, shortstop for the Baltimore Orioles.  I haven’t seen him play yet this year, but I don’t think I expect much from him.  I kinda wish the players were wearing their normal team uniforms for this event—I’m having a hard time seeing this guy in an Orioles jersey.  I don’t know why.   8:58 p.m.  – Tejada put on a show, contrary to my expectations.  He put up seven, trying with Berkman and Bonds for the lead.  He really smoked a couple of them, too.  I’d like to see him hit again, so I hope he makes the second round.   9:01 p.m.  – Jim Thome is the next batter.  He’s leading the National League in home runs, but I’m not a fan.  I don’t particularly dislike him, the way I do Bonds, but I don’t like him either.  Hopefully he’ll be eliminated in this round and I won’t have to see him anymore.   9:04 p.m.  – Thome hits four, so I think he’s done.  Now the vapid Sam Ryan is on the screen, and there’ll be a commercial break after that, so I think it’s a good time for a trip to the bathroom.   9:08 p.m.  – Now we’ve got David Ortiz.  I see by his hat that he plays for Boston.  Are these really the best home run hitters the American League has to offer?   9:11 p.m.  – Ortiz hits the roof with a ball, and we’re waiting for a ruling on whether or not it counts as a home run.  No, of course it’s not a home run!  Come on, it landed in the field of play.  In the meantime, they’re showing Sammy Sosa warming up in the hallway.   9:13 p.m.  – The first audible occurrence of the F-bomb for the evening, uttered by Ortiz after an out.  When you put live microphones on the field, this is what you get.  I personally don’t care, but I’m sure there are people out there saying "but my kids are watching!"   9:15 p.m.  – Ortiz ends with three, tied for last with Blalock.  He’s probably done.  Other than Tejada, the American League hitters are not doing well.  Maybe it’s because they aren’t familiar with the park?  I don’t know, I’m just making things up.  At any rate, they’ve got one more chance in Rafael Palmeiro.   9:18 p.m.  – Here comes Sammy Sosa, who is always fun to watch in these things.  He can crank the ball, and he loves putting on a show for the fans.  That’s a good combination.  He also seems personable, which is quite a contrast to Bonds.   9:21 p.m.  – Who in the hell is pitching to Sosa?  It looks like he’s  trying  to get him out.  Hey buddy, the batter is  supposed  to crush the ball tonight.  Throw it over the plate!   9:24 p.m.  – A couple of rednecks in cowboy hats just caught one of Sammy’s home runs, and the camera lingered on them a bit too long.  Welcome to Texas.   9:25 p.m.  – Sosa finishes with five homers, so Thome is out.  Bonds, Berkman, and Tejada are definitely in the next round.  The fourth player will be either Sosa or Palmeiro, depending on what Palmeiro does next.   9:31 p.m.  – I think one of the kids shagging flies in the outfield just killed himself lunging after a ball hit by Palmeiro.  Very sad.   9:33 p.m.  – Hank Aaron is in the stands, taking pictures of the proceedings with his cell phone.  How surreal is that?   9:35 p.m.  – Palmeiro just hit his sixth, so he’s in and Sosa’s out.  The second round will be Bonds, Berkman, Tejada, and Palmeiro.  It turns out we’ll have two National and two American League representatives after all.  I’m picking Bonds and Berkman to move on to the finals, though.   SECOND ROUND    9:52 p.m.  – Bonds is batting.  I missed the beginning of his at-bat because the terribly long delay between rounds caused me to wander away from the TV.  They had to open the roof of the stadium in Houston.  This thing is taking far too long.  Eliminate the extended intros, some of the commercials (do we need them between EVERY batter?), and the roof delay.  That would make it easier to watch.  It would be fun to be there in person, but the delays would be even more excruciating.   9:55 p.m.  – Bonds is done with three, so he might not move on after all.   10:02 p.m.  – The delay notwithstanding, I’m glad they opened the roof.  Berkman is now banging the ball entirely out of the park with regularity.  This is what makes the Derby so much fun to watch.  I still would have preferred to see Griffey, but Berkman is doing quite well in his place.   10:12 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his fourth, so Bonds is done (Berkman hit 10).  Unfortunately, Tejada’s at-bat is being virtually neglected by commentators Chris Berman and Joe Morgan, who are talking to Reggie Jackson.   10:21 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his 15th, which is a single-round record for the Derby.  The fans outside the stadium are in a dogpile, trying to get the ball.  That home run is his last, but he’s in the Finals.  On one hand, I’d say he doesn’t have enough left to win it, but he seemed to get stronger as he went.  If he’s up against Berkman, that could be a great round.  Again, it comes down to what Palmeiro does.   10:25 p.m.  – Bonds, out of the competition, has changed out of his uniform and into street clothes.  I can’t say why, but he looks like a woman.  An ugly woman, yes, but a woman nonetheless.   10:33 p.m.  – Palmeiro bores the crowd to death and only hits...um, a few.  I’m not even sure how many, but it wasn’t enough to move on.  It’ll be Berkman and Tejada in the finals.   FINAL ROUND    10:41 p.m.  – Berkman finishes with four home runs.  I think Tejada’s got this one in the bag.   10:51 p.m.  – Tejada just hit his fifth, and the Derby is over.  He wins.  A little anticlimactic after the showcase of the first two rounds, but it was a good show anyway.

      I noticed this morning that I only posted four entries to my blog last week.  I'll try to get back to a normal posting schedule this week, which is to say that at least one or two days should see at least two posts.  I'll start off, as per usual, with a weekend review.  The weekend was pretty uneventful, enough so that I almost feel bad about actually writing a review of it.  I don't feel bad enough to not do it, though.  Hey, at least it's free.  Maybe if I start getting paid for this somehow, I'll worry more about posting boring entries.  In other words, if I bore you, send money and I'll think about stopping.  Of course, Brandi lives with me now.  That means that for the first time in quite a while, this weekend did not feature significant driving for either one of us, and there was much rejoicing.  Brandi was napping on the couch when I got home from work on Friday.  Eventually she woke up, and we went to Myles Pizza for dinner.  It's a local place in BG that makes awesome pizza that's totally stacked with cheese and toppings--a couple of pieces really fill you up.  Good stuff.  We went home afterwards and I watched the Reds game on TV while Brandi played around on the computer.  Later that evening my friend McComas came over to take advantage of my high-speed internet connection.  He's doing a job search, and didn't want to wait on his own dial-up connection.  The three of us hung out and chatted for a while, and then McComas and I played some PlayStation football in order to warm up for the new release, which happens sometime this week.  Brandi and I slept in on Saturday afternoon.  She went rollerblading when we got up, while I stayed home to continue my attempts to get her laptop on my home network.  Sadly, I was unsuccessful.  We went to the mall after she got back.  She bought a couple of things there, and we had a late lunch/early dinner.  Once again, we watched a little bit of the Reds game on TV when we got home, and then we went over to B-Dubs for the rest of the evening.  We had a drink and sat out on the patio there for a while before heading inside.  Cricket and Adam met up with us a little bit later on for a couple of drinks, so that was a pretty good time.  We didn't stay out very late, though.  We headed home and watched a few minutes of  Saturday Night Live 's "Best of Will Ferrell 2" before turning in.  On Sunday we slept in again.  Well, I did, at any rate.  Brandi got up before I did and went to work out.  She was back by the time I finally got up.  We went to the BG public library, and then to the humane society to visit the cats.  Some of the cats were not in a very good mood, and I've got scratches of the backs of my hands to prove it.  We headed home after that.  Brandi started reading, which eventually turned into a nap, while I watched the Reds on TV.  I also managed to read and play video games while she slept (for quite a while), and then we went to the grocery when she got up.  We spent the rest of the evening watching part of  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone  and being goofy.  Today has been up and down so far.  My car stalled out several times on my way to work this morning, which was a source of pretty severe irritation.  I've gotten a tune-up and had the air filter changed.  I don't know what else it could be, but it does seem to happen after a night of rain (although that could be coincidence or my imagination).  I also had a headache for a pretty fair portion of the morning, although that seems now to have mostly faded.  On the bright side, I've had a few things to do at work, which makes the day go by faster (although it leaves less time for blogging).  Also, I got a pretty sweet Reds hat.

      What a beautiful day.&nbsp; As opposed to when I posted this morning, I'm loving life right now.&nbsp; I'm blogging outside on my balcony, taking advantage of Brandi's laptop and my new wireless connection.&nbsp; The sun is shining, I've got a Smirnoff Triple Black by my side, and I'm blogging.&nbsp; Does life get better than this?&nbsp; I'm even passing up valuable quality time with my PlayStation to be out here.   You may have noticed that the novelty of my wireless internet connection hasn't worn off for me quite yet.&nbsp; Let me bask in it for a while longer.&nbsp; Things will get back to normal shortly.   I came out here because the weather is perfect right now.&nbsp; According to  urlLink the Weather Channel , it's currently 75° and fair here in Bowling Green.&nbsp; I like a variety of different weather types, but this is probably the perfect weather for just sitting outside and doing nothing in particular.&nbsp; It's comfortable, and there's a slight breeze from time to time that feels oh so good.  Days like this make me think of one thing in particular, and that is high school football season.&nbsp; I love football, and that passion began with the Troy Trojans and high school football.&nbsp; Five weeks from now at this time, I'll be in my car on I-75, on my way to Troy for the season opener.&nbsp; I'm so ready for it I can barely contain myself.&nbsp; I don't know what it is about high school football that grips me so tightly, especially since the Trojans have had some tough seasons of late, but I just can't get enough.  Anyway, that's what I'm doing.&nbsp; I'm sitting out here, surfing the 'net and enjoying the day, letting the sensation transport me into football mode (it's never very far away).&nbsp; Five weeks from now and I'll definitely have my game face on, especially if there are a lot of days like this.

      Even if you're not a BGSU fan or a sports fan in general, I invite you to take a look at  urlLink Ay Ziggy Zoomba , a BGSU Falcons fan site and message board.  The site has been recently redesigned and relaunched, and it looks awesome.  I'm pleased and proud to say that the design work was done by my cousin, Mike Williams, who also happens to be one of my best friends.  The site has always been a fun place for BGSU fans and MAC (and CCHA) fans to hang out, but now it's the best-looking sports fan site out there as well.

      At least it's Friday, I'll give it that much.&nbsp; I get two days off after today, and sometime in the next two hours I'll be handed a paycheck.&nbsp; Oh, and I have a peanut butter cookie in my desk drawer.&nbsp; Other than these things, today doesn't have much going for it so far.   There is an open can of Mountain Dew sitting just to my right.&nbsp; This is the third morning in a row that I've felt compelled to start the day with a caffeinated beverage.&nbsp; I don't know what my problem is.&nbsp; I've been getting more sleep than usual lately, and for some reason it just makes it harder and harder for me to wake up in the mornings.&nbsp; I don't mean "wake up" in the actual physical sense of "stop being asleep", but in terms of feeling awake and alert and not in danger of falling back asleep at any given moment.&nbsp; I was in bed well before 1:00 a.m. last night, and that's been the norm this week.&nbsp; Usually I don't get to bed until 2:00 a.m. or later, and my morning issues aren't nearly as bad under those circumstances (but they do still exist--I'm not a morning person by any means).&nbsp; Apparently my body doesn't like functioning with more than five hours of sleep.&nbsp; Through the week, anyway--on a weekend, I can sleep like a champion and feel glorious upon waking.&nbsp; If weekend sleeping were an Olympic event, I feel confident that I could bring glory to my country.  Oh, but that's not all.&nbsp; As I left for work this morning, my car decided to resume its irritating habit of stalling each time I took my foot off the gas.&nbsp; This is really driving me crazy.&nbsp; I did manage to make it to work, but it makes me nervous to drive it here.&nbsp; I have to drive on some pretty busy streets to get here, and stalling in the wrong spot could prove to be a real headache.&nbsp; I managed to keep it running, though--I'm getting to be really good at braking with my left foot.&nbsp; I've been talking over my problems this morning with some car-minded co-workers, and we're all pretty much stumped over what the problem could be.&nbsp; I'll continue to monitor it for a few more days, but if it keeps doing it I'm going to have to put it back in the shop.&nbsp; There is significant driving right around the corner (a.k.a. "football season"), and I'm going to need a car I can depend on.

      (or, "Mike McComas is a Brave, Brave Man")   What an interesting day I had after leaving work yesterday.   Almost immediately after I posted about my wireless dilemma yesterday afternoon, I decided to take the plunge and get it over with.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time, after all, and so it made sense to me that I should just go ahead and do it as soon as possible.&nbsp; I purchased the networking gear online through  urlLink Circuit City  and used their Express Pickup Service so I could just stop by the local store and grab my order on the way home.   As I was driving home with my gear, I got a call from my friend McComas.&nbsp; His girlfriend was at work and he had a softball game that evening, so he needed someone to watch their 7-month-old daughter Kiersten for a little bit.&nbsp; I'm more than happy to help out my friends, and he didn't have anyone else he could ask anyway, so I said I would do it.&nbsp; He probably thought Brandi would be there to do most of the babysitting, but she was at work.   When I got home I immediately started working on establishing my wireless network.&nbsp; I managed to get the router set up and configured before McComas got there with the baby, and then I started on Brandi's laptop.&nbsp; I thought I'd get that one out of the way first since it's had so many issues with the wired network and I wanted to see if those would continue, and also since installing the network card wouldn't require any disassembly like the desktop computers would.&nbsp; That's where I was when the baby arrived.   I've made no secret in this blog about my general disdain for small children, and that's been the case for a long time.&nbsp; I've always avoided babies whenever possible, so I know very little about what in the hell to do with them.&nbsp; As such, having one be utterly dependent upon me for even a short period of time was a bit of a culture shock.&nbsp; I thought I would be able to continue with my networking tasks, but that didn't really happen.&nbsp; Kiersten, unlike me, is something of a people person, and she got a little fussy whenever I wasn't holding her.&nbsp; Put her down, she screams and cries; pick her up, she giggles and bounces.&nbsp; Babies are weird.   Anyway, she was there for about an hour and a half.&nbsp; In that time I did manage to finish configuring Brandi's laptop for wireless networking--I had absolutely no trouble--but that's as far as I got.&nbsp; I'm sure McComas feared for Kiersten's life on his way back from the softball game, but she was fine.&nbsp; When&nbsp;he got there, he invited me to a cookout one of his softball teammates was having, so I headed over there with him.&nbsp; I got some free food out of the deal, and there were a couple of people there that I knew, so it was pretty cool.&nbsp; Of course, several people there besides McComas had young kids, so that was a little weird.&nbsp; The kids themselves were fine, but I found myself in a crowd of people approximately my own age, and the dominant topic of conversation was children.&nbsp; Blech.   I continued working on wireless installation when I got home from the cookout.&nbsp; I tackled one desktop before Brandi got home from work, and the second one afterwards.&nbsp; I love doing that--opening the towers and working inside.&nbsp; I got a bit of a surprise with the first one, when I opened it up to find I didn't have any open PCI slots.&nbsp; After a few moments of pondering, I took out the modem.&nbsp; I've had the computer for almost two years and the modem has never been used--I don't even have a phone line in my apartment--so I thought that was a pretty safe bet.&nbsp; Other than that, the installation was pretty smooth.&nbsp; I had some small issues with the second desktop, but that was mainly because the computer is old and it's still running Windows 98.&nbsp; I got it all taken care of, though, so my apartment is now fully wireless.&nbsp; It doesn't matter a whole lot now, except for the newfound&nbsp;connectivity of Brandi's laptop, but it'll be great when we move into our new place next week.

      Here's the score as it stands right now.&nbsp; I've got one cable modem, one router, two desktop computers (one of which is generally a file server but occasionally acts as an internet machine), and two laptops (one is Brandi's).&nbsp; The router is wired, which has been a little inconvenient, but not terribly so.&nbsp; All the machines are generally located in the same room, so the cable isn't strung all over the place.   That soon may be changing, though.&nbsp; Brandi and I will soon be moving into a larger apartment, and it seems unlikely that all the computers will end up in the same room.&nbsp; More to the point, it seems unlikely that they'll end up in the same room with a cable hookup, so networking at that point has the potential to become a problem.  With that in mind, I've been thinking a lot lately about purchasing some wireless networking gear and taking the plunge.&nbsp; For the past few days I've been researching wireless options, and looking at different routers and network cards.&nbsp; My original thought was to make the switch when we move, but I'm starting to lean more toward doing it sooner.&nbsp; Maybe.   While there is currently some minor cord clutter in the living room, the main problem I could solve (hopefully) by switching to wireless now would be the problem with networking Brandi's laptop.&nbsp; That computer has resisted every effort I've made so far to add it to my existing network.&nbsp; The consensus is that the integrated network card is bad, but I've also tried using the external card I have for my laptop and I can't even get that to install correctly.&nbsp; Given the presence of the other machines, this isn't a terribly big deal, but there are times when I would prefer it if Brandi could use her computer instead of mine.&nbsp; We're working around this so far, but if I could get it networked, it would make me very happy.   Of course, having either laptop on a wireless connection would be nice, as we would be free to roam around the apartment.&nbsp; I like to do some work out on the balcony from time to time, and I think it would be great if I could access my network and the internet from out there.  When it comes to making the switch now, I would be remiss if I didn't mention my own "early adopter" mindset.&nbsp; When it comes to technology, I like to get it as soon as I can.&nbsp; I'm something of an impulse buyer in that regard.&nbsp; In other words, I don't really need a reason to get this stuff now.&nbsp; I just want it.  I was all set to get this stuff today on my way home from work so I could set it all up this evening.&nbsp; Then a couple of things happened.  First, I discovered some new products.&nbsp; I was originally planning to get USB network cards for my desktop computers for easy installation.&nbsp; I'm comfortable opening the cases and working in there, but I didn't want to do it if I didn't have to.&nbsp; However, with the gear I was looking at today, a USB card isn't available.&nbsp; The USB card I was looking at would still work, of course, but it wouldn't work to the system's full potential, and what's the use in that?&nbsp; So that threw a little wrench into the works.&nbsp; There's also the fact that this new equipment is a little more expensive, but the extra expense is negligible, so there's no real need to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, I got a call from my landlord, who said that our new apartment will be ready for move-in early next week.&nbsp; Given that the move is only a few days away, it makes perfect sense to wait it out, right?  Being the way I am, I had to have a new justification ready just in case I decide to do it before we move, and here it is:&nbsp; if I make the switch now, I can just plug it in and go when we move into the new place.&nbsp; I won't have to do all this networking stuff in addition to moving furniture and all that.&nbsp; It seems like a good idea to me.&nbsp; I still haven't decided for sure that I'm making the stop on the way home today (and I have less than 45 minutes now to decide for sure), but I wouldn't be surprised either way.

      I'm a little heated right now, because I've already written this blog entry once.&nbsp; As I was preparing to publish, I clicked over to a different window to check something out, and that turned out to be a mistake.&nbsp; When I clicked back, MSIE encountered a fatal error and had to close, and wouldn't even let me copy what I had written.&nbsp; I  hate &nbsp;when that happens.&nbsp; Luckily it wasn't terribly long, so I'll now attempt to recreate it in its entirety.  &nbsp;  Unlike yesterday, I don't have a whole lot to write about today.&nbsp; Nothing seems to be capturing my attention.&nbsp; I do have a couple of things to note, though.&nbsp;    This work week already looks like it will be a long one.&nbsp; Our receptionist, who often serves as a liasion between myself and the office manager, is on vacation.&nbsp; Being the purchasing manager, I sometimes field calls from vendors informing me that they can't ship our orders because we're behind in our payments.&nbsp; Normally I relay this information to the receptionist, who waves her magic wand and sends out the payments.&nbsp; Our office manager, however, likes to drag her feet on this sort of thing for some unknown reason, and doesn't care that it's holding up parts we need to fill orders.&nbsp; Then I take heat from the engineering department because our parts aren't arriving on time.&nbsp; I hate passing the buck, but it really isn't my fault.  &nbsp;   Anyone out there who laughed at me for  urlLink spending All-Star votes  on Wily Mo Peña, I'll accept your apologies now.&nbsp; I at least want it noted that I was on the bandwagon at an early stage.&nbsp; Wily Mo was just named National League Player of the Week, and his hot streak continues.&nbsp; He&nbsp;crushed a home run last night against Milwaukee, and when the ball came off the bat it made a sound that I've never heard before.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; He's been doing so well that I wouldn't be upset (or surprised) if the Reds traded away Austin Kearns, if they can get anything for an outfielder with a lot of potential but who seems to be injured a lot.  &nbsp;   On another Reds note, heralded pitching prospect Brandon Claussen is scheduled to start tonight against the Brewers.&nbsp; I'd like to check him out, but I don't think the game is being televised.  &nbsp;  That's really all I have.&nbsp; However, just to make sure everyone feels like they're getting their money's worth for this entry, I offer the following poem which I wrote over four years ago.  &nbsp;   Rain   &nbsp;  Slender summer showers  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like lace on skin  blossom in secret,  immense whispers  which build and swell  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and slice into storms  &nbsp;&nbsp; of thunder and wonder,  &nbsp;&nbsp; of lightning licking  like tongues, tendrils searching,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeking shelter  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like lovers, laughing  &nbsp;&nbsp; after standing  &nbsp;&nbsp; soaked and stranded  in a summer evening storm.    &nbsp;   © 2000 by Jonathan W. Williams    I'm sure I had a justification at the time for the weird indentation pattern.&nbsp; If so, I can't remember what it was.&nbsp; Other than that, which seems vaguely extraneous, I like this one pretty well.

      Brandi and I went for a walk on campus last night.  &nbsp;  It is neither accident nor coincidence that I continue to reside so close to the BGSU campus.&nbsp; I left the area for a year after graduation, and eventually gravitated back to it.&nbsp; The ease of attending Falcon sporting events aside, I love being just a short walk away from the University and living in a college town.&nbsp; I truly enjoy being in a place that's so alive all the time.  &nbsp;  I love the feeling I get when I'm on campus, and I spend time there when I can.&nbsp; Granted, most of the time I spend on campus takes place at Doyt Perry Stadium or Anderson Arena, but I've been known to head over and sit underneath the bell tower or in the stands in the stadium and do some writing.&nbsp; It's hard to explain, but I feel more engaged and switched-on when I'm there.&nbsp; I remember my high school guidance counselor saying you'd know the right college for you by the way you felt when you were there, and there is no doubt that Bowling Green was the right choice for me.  &nbsp;  Of course, I wasted two years at Wright State University ("right state, wrong university" indeed) before I found that out.&nbsp; (Actually, it's somewhat unfair to call those two years a waste, as I did have some great times there, and made some good friends.)  &nbsp;  At any rate, Brandi and I took a walk on campus last night, and one of our topics of conversation was how we would do college differently if we had a chance to do it all over again.&nbsp; This is something I've been thinking about a lot lately, for some unknown reason.&nbsp; The more I think about it, the more I realize that I just wasn't ready for college.&nbsp; Despite the fact that I pulled down pretty good grades (I'd have graduated  cum laude  were it not for some obscure transfer rules in that area), I don't think I was very good at it.  &nbsp;  I was extremely lucky to be born with a high level of intelligence.&nbsp; I don't say that to be pompous, although I know it probably comes off that way; I just think it would be silly not to be aware of it and acknowledge it.&nbsp; I have an excellent memory and a knack for figuring things out.&nbsp; Needless to say, those abilities proved quite useful in excelling academically with a minimum of effort through high school, and also fostered some pretty poor study habits that carried over into my college career.  &nbsp;  It was rare for me to arrive prepared for a class.&nbsp; If there was a reading assignment, chances were good that I hadn't done it.&nbsp; Minor writing assignments were probably finished moments before classtime, if at all, and major writing assignments were likely started and finished the night before.&nbsp; I wouldn't classify myself as chronically absent, but I was known to miss a class or two from time to time.&nbsp; Somehow I got through in spite of these tendencies, and even managed to do well in terms of grades.  &nbsp;  Honestly, thinking back on it now, I have no idea how that happened.&nbsp; I could certainly rise to a challenge when I was presented one, but otherwise I was content to coast through and do only what I needed to maintain a certain grade point average.&nbsp; I just didn't have a hunger for knowledge, or a sense of the big picture.  &nbsp;  I think this is something that most college students lack when it comes to academics.&nbsp; They have a tendency to worry about what material they will be tested on, and learning that material for the test, instead of thinking about what knowledge they should be taking away from a class in general, and what they should be learning and why.&nbsp; When you take the college experience as a whole, it doesn't matter what grade you got on your Psych.&nbsp;101 final your freshman year.&nbsp; What matters is how much you retain from that class if ever there comes a time when such knowledge is necessary.&nbsp; That has a tendency to get lost in all the focus on individual classes, tests, papers, lectures, labs, etc.  &nbsp;  Surprisingly, I do feel like I've retained a pretty fair amount from my university experience, but it's nowhere near what it could have been if I had put more effort into it.&nbsp; That craving for knowledge that I lacked then I feel like I have now.&nbsp; I don't know what has happened in the meantime to grant me that quality, but I do feel like I'd be a whole lot better at college if I had another shot at it.  &nbsp;  I'm starting to think more seriously about graduate school.&nbsp; I don't know exactly how I would go about making that happen, nor do I know why a Master of Arts in English would be significantly more "useful" than a Bachelor of Arts in English.&nbsp; I just know that it's something I would really like to do, and that makes it worth looking into.&nbsp; Maybe this time I'll be ready.

      As always when I write a movie review, this entry could and probably will give away some plot points, so proceed at your own risk.&nbsp; If you haven't seen the movie but plan to, I suggest you skip this one.&nbsp; Oh, but come back and read it after you've seen the film.  &nbsp;  I follow similar advice myself.&nbsp; I almost never read reviews of movies I haven't seen yet, because I feel like they give away too much.&nbsp; I'll often go back after I've seen a film, though, and check out some reviews, just to see how my opinion differs and to sharpen my own perception of the film.&nbsp; I think it's a good system.&nbsp; Still, even without reading reviews, you can still get a feel for the general consensus about a film just by catching headlines and listening to people talk.&nbsp; I had heard that  Spider-Man 2  was pretty good, and I liked the first one a lot, so I went in with pretty high expectations.  &nbsp;  I was not disappointed at all.&nbsp; This movie is incredible.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  First off, it's everything you would want a superhero movie to be.&nbsp; It's got a fast pace, it's funny when it should be, and the action sequences are awesome.&nbsp; There's a scene with a runaway train that will leave you on the edge of your seat, and that isn't the only one like that.&nbsp; It's very intense and fun.  &nbsp;  It's also more than that, though.&nbsp; The film does a great job of showing Peter Parker as a real person, and of exploring the dichotomy between him and his Spider-Man alter-ego.&nbsp; He feels a need to fight crime as Spider-Man, but doing so is interfering with his own personal goals, not to mention his ability to pay his rent.&nbsp; This all comes to a head when he decides to give up being Spider-Man and get his own life in order, including his pursuit of Mary Jane Watson (the proverbial girl next door), who is inconveniently engaged to the son of Peter's boss.  &nbsp;  Obviously, there comes a point where Peter is forced to take up his role of Spider-Man once again, and this point comes when Mary Jane is captured by the nefarious mad scientist Dr. Octopus.&nbsp; This leads, eventually,&nbsp;to MJ discovering his secret identity, which in turn leads to the way the movie ends (hint:&nbsp; she doesn't marry the astronaut), which should provide some interesting plot points for  Spider-Man 3  (due in theaters in 2007).  &nbsp;  Anytime I'm presented with a mythic hero like Spider-Man, I automatically make comparisons to Luke Skywalker.&nbsp; It's an automatic reaction.&nbsp; At any rate, I noticed one interesting thing that I thought was worth noting.&nbsp; When Skywalker casts away his lightsaber toward the end of Return of the Jedi, he's denouncing his dark side (the path his father took) and putting himself firmly on the noble path of the Jedi.&nbsp; However, when Peter discards his Spider-Man outfit, he relinquishes his noble side (the path encouraged by his uncle) and returns to the murk of being a mere mortal.&nbsp; He's not turning toward the "dark side" (to use  Star Wars  terminology), but he does become more inner-directed and selfish.&nbsp; Eventually (probably in the third film) he'll have to integrate these two sides of his personality, now that he knows he can't simply stop being one or the other.  &nbsp;  Since I mentioned  Star Wars , I may as well go on a bit of a semi-related tangent.&nbsp; One thing you'll notice about both  Spider-Man  films is that the computer generated graphics are a little weak.&nbsp; They're fairly decent, but if you pause to consider for a moment, you're never going to be fooled into thinking that Tobey Maguire is actually web-hopping above the streets of New York.&nbsp; It looks like digital imagery.&nbsp; That's perhaps because the filmmakers knew that the story was strong enough that they didn't have to focus on impeccable visuals.&nbsp; The two most recent  Star Wars  films, on the other hand...the computer graphics were awesome, but the story could have been told a lot better.&nbsp; I'm still holding out hopes that the yet-to-be-titled Episode III can be as good as  Spider-Man 2  when it comes to showing emotional depth and despair.&nbsp; The fall of Anakin Skywalker should be full of anguish, and so far George Lucas hasn't shown himself to be capable of working with that type of emotion.  &nbsp;  Of course, part of the reason the  Spider-Man  films have done so well on the emotional side is because the casting director has done a superb job of selecting actors to fill the roles.&nbsp; Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have great chemistry as Peter and Mary Jane, and Alfred Molina did a great job as Dr. Octopus.&nbsp; Also, James Franco, who looks to be the next villain as the Green Goblin reincarnated, did a nice job as Peter's friend Harry. &nbsp; Any problems I had with the film were due to certain plot points being underdeveloped, which I'm sure was something they had to do to keep the movie's run time at a reasonable length.&nbsp; Harry Osborn seemed to go crazy a little too quickly.&nbsp; Not enough time was spent on the madness of Dr. Octopus.&nbsp; Also, there was a little thing with Peter and his landlord's daughter, and then she disappeared...what happened there? &nbsp; All in all, though, the movie is very good, and worth the $9.25 to see it on a big screen with awesome sound.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind seeing it again at some point before it leaves the theater, and I'll definitely pick it up when it comes out on DVD.

       urlLink Running His Own Route   This is a nice article on Shane Carter, who will be a senior on Troy High School's football and basketball teams this upcoming season. He's definitely got the genes for it--you may have heard of his older brothers Butch and Cris Carter. Butch played and coached in the NBA, and Cris was a star receiver for Ohio State and then the Minnesota Vikings, and will likely end up in the NFL Hall of Fame.  At any rate, it's a nice little appetizer for high school football season, which starts four weeks from today.  Being the way I am, I generally have at least a general idea of how far away the season is, and when it starts getting this close I start putting my game face on.  I'm wearing my Trojans polo shirt today, and I'll probably wear it each Friday from now through the end of the season.  Here's what Troy's schedule looks like for this season:  8/27 Dublin Coffman 9/3 @ Centerville 9/10 Kettering Alter 9/17 @ Sidney 9/24 Greenville 10/1 @ Piqua 10/8 Vandalia Butler 10/15 @ Northmont 10/22 @ Fairmont 10/29 Trotwood-Madison  On a semi-related sidenote, Brandi mentioned to me the other day that she couldn't wait for football season to start.  Did I find the right girl or what?

      I know, I know.&nbsp; I just "purged the notebook" a couple of days ago, and now here I am, doing it again.&nbsp; For whatever reason that just seems to be the way my mind is operating this week.    I went yesterday after work to get tickets for the  urlLink John Kerry rally in Bowling Green  on Sunday.&nbsp; I'm pretty excited about this.&nbsp; The only experience I have that's even remotely like this is when President Reagan passed through my hometown of Troy on a train back in the 80s.&nbsp; That was way different, though, for several reasons.&nbsp; Reagan was already President, and not just a candidate.&nbsp; He didn't stop and speak, just waved at the crowd (and yes, there was quite a crowd) as the train passed--he was visible for maybe ten seconds.&nbsp; Also, I was pretty young at the time, maybe 7 or 8, so I had no clue what was going on.&nbsp; At any rate, I'm really interested to hear Kerry and Edwards speak in person so I can get a better feel for them.&nbsp; I'm sure it will be quite an event.&nbsp; There were a lot of people there getting tickets, and this was just one of several pickup locations, so I'm sure the turnout will be pretty significant.    The place where I picked up the tickets is a local bookstore/coffee shop in Bowling Green called  urlLink Grounds for Thought .&nbsp; I had only been in there once before, but I should really get in there more often.&nbsp; It seems like a really cool place to hang out, and a lot of people do just that.&nbsp; They have tons of used books, and the place smells awesome.&nbsp; What more could you ask for?&nbsp; I'm not one for coffee myself (I prefer my caffeine served cold), but they have pastries and stuff too.&nbsp; I could totally see myself popping in there sometimes after work with a notebook and doing some writing.    I realized yesterday while doing something totally unrelated (strange how the mind works, yes?) that  The Barbaric Yawp  is now six months into its existence.&nbsp; And still going strong!&nbsp; More pages will be added soon, and of course you can look for at least one entry each business day.    Moving is just about done.&nbsp; There are still a few odds and ends left at the old place, but I think we'll probably empty it out this evening so we can dedicate ourselves to cleaning.&nbsp; The new place is coming together pretty nicely.&nbsp; There's still plenty of clutter, but things are finding their places.&nbsp; The couch and television were successfully moved yesterday, and I hooked up some electronics when I got home.&nbsp; I also installed a new shower head, which was badly needed.&nbsp; Once we get our cable TV and internet service hooked up on Saturday, we'll be in great shape.    Work is the last place I want to be right now.&nbsp; That's true most of the time, of course, but moreso today than usual.&nbsp; Everything (and everyone) is getting on my nerves.&nbsp; Maybe I need a nap.    I'm coming to realize that I really don't like the way Blogger now deals with bulleted items and the editing of a post. It takes forever for me to get it to look right, with the right line spacing and everything. It works almost like Microsoft Word, where it takes your work and kind of does its own thing with it. I like a lot of the new features they've added, but that's not one of them.&nbsp; Also, it absolutely infuriates me when I try to "Publish Post" and I get a "This Page Cannot Be Displayed" error.&nbsp; Sometimes it saves my work and sometimes it doesn't, and I think you can imagine how furious I become when it doesn't.&nbsp; That error doesn't occur often, but even rarely is  too  often.

      Brandi and I are still in the process of moving.&nbsp; When we first secured the new place it sounded like the transition period would be over a weekend, which would have made this a much smoother process.&nbsp; Doing it over the course of a work week isn't that big of a deal, but it does slow everything down.&nbsp; Spending over ten hours per day in getting ready for, going to, being at, and coming from work really gets in the way.&nbsp; That and my propensity to postpone work for PlayStation, of course.&nbsp; Also, Brandi works into the evenings, so we haven't been able to work together on it much since Sunday.   Still, we shouldn't have any trouble getting finished on time.&nbsp; Yesterday and today were and are big days in the process.&nbsp; For one thing, I unhooked, packed up, and moved my PlayStation yesterday, so I can't "waste" time on it until the TV is moved.&nbsp; I also moved a fair amount of other stuff, and then Brandi and I went through and pulled a lot of clothes I can't/don't wear.&nbsp; She'll be taking those items to Goodwill at some point today.   Today the couch is being moved, and hopefully the television as well.&nbsp; I feel like a dumbass for having a moving company come to take my couch from the middle of the building to the end, but I didn't want to mess with it at all.&nbsp; It's a big couch, and it was a real pain to get it into the place.&nbsp; I'll gladly put it into the hands of the professionals.&nbsp; I think they'll probably move the TV as well, but it's not a problem if they don't get to it for some reason.&nbsp; The TV I have is big and awkward, but it would be easy enough to move with a hand from Brandi.&nbsp; After today the only thing that should be left in the old apartment is one computer, which I'm leaving there for the time being because&nbsp;we won't have internet access in the new place until Saturday.&nbsp; For that matter, I'm not thrilled about moving the television before then, but the only thing I've been watching cable TV for is Reds games, and they haven't been much fun to watch lately.&nbsp; If I miss a few it's no big deal, and this way I can hook up my PlayStation and get back to business as usual.  I didn't get quite as much done yesterday as I would have liked, but I did okay.&nbsp; I got a late start.&nbsp; Brandi called before I left work to ask a favor.&nbsp; She was teaching a yoga class&nbsp;in the&nbsp;evening but hadn't brought any music for it.&nbsp; This led me to Circuit City in search of a generic classical music CD.&nbsp; I found one in fairly short order, but no trip to Circuit City--even one with a specific purpose--is complete without a little browsing.&nbsp; This is usually dangerous, and yesterday was no exception.&nbsp; I left there with the CD I came for, and also with three DVDs:&nbsp;  Batman ,  Forrest Gump , and  South Park:&nbsp; Bigger, Longer, and Uncut  (my DVD page will be updated later today to reflect these additions to my collection).  At any rate, by the time I took that CD to Brandi at her place of employment, I ended up getting home about an hour later than usual.&nbsp; I did spend some quality time with my PlayStation at that point, and then put the Reds game on TV while I moved stuff.&nbsp; I got the living room pretty much emptied out and some other important items moved.&nbsp; I was still working when Brandi got home.  When she got home (close to 10:00 p.m.) we started talking about some stuff we'd like to do or have, and we ended up making a trip to Wal-Mart.&nbsp; We bought a DVD shelf and a new microwave (my old, enormous&nbsp;microwave will be making a one-way trip to Goodwill this afternoon).&nbsp; We had a late dinner when we got back, and then I built the shelf.&nbsp; I was hammering away at it near midnight, and that's one of the things I love about living in a college town--you can generally get away with stuff like that.  Then came the purge of my closet, during which I amused Brandi by trying on clothes which no longer fit.&nbsp; Those clothes are also making the one-way trip to Goodwill today, and I say good riddance to them.  I plan on moving just about everything that's left this evening after I get home from work.&nbsp; Hopefully then I can stop talking about this "moving experience" and get back to whatever it is I normally ramble about.

       Overhearing a co-worker giving directions to a trucker on how to get to our facility, I have to wonder how she ever gets from Point A to Point B without becoming hopelessly lost or crashing into anything.&nbsp; She doesn't know street names or route numbers, or how highway exits are labeled.&nbsp; She was complaining about a turn-only lane that isn't clearly marked, when there are in fact&nbsp; two &nbsp;signs clearly stating the fact that it's a turn-only lane, not to mention the markings on the pavement.    This same co-worker wandered into my office this morning, complaining under her breath about the fact that it's not sunny today.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if she was trying to make conversation or what, so I turned around to look.&nbsp; In fact, she was holding a document up to the window and using the light to trace a signature from an original document.&nbsp; I have no idea what she was doing, but there can't be too many legitimate reasons for this, can there?   It took me very little time to get to lunch today, and I have no idea how that happened.&nbsp; Maybe I ran a red light or something without being aware of it.   As much as I love the Reds, watching them play lately has been an exercise in frustration.&nbsp; Earlier in the season, it didn't matter if they got behind early because I felt like they could and would come back, and often they did.&nbsp; Now it doesn't matter if they get ahead early, because they've shown a propensity for blowing leads and losing games.&nbsp; They've currently lost six games in a row to even their record at 50-50 with 62 games left.&nbsp; With the trading deadline approaching, it'll be interesting&nbsp;to see what they do.&nbsp; The best I'm hoping for at this point is for them to stand pat.&nbsp; I doubt they'll attempt to upgrade for this season, but at the same time I don't think they can afford to trade players away for prospects.&nbsp; There's too much risk of alienating the fans (and the players) if they do that.&nbsp; I think they should stay the course for the rest of the season and see how it plays out, and then attempt to fill holes in the offseason.&nbsp; As good as the Reds have been at times this season, there are plenty of holes to be filled.   I'm still hoping to make it down to Great American Ballpark for a game before the end of the season.&nbsp; I have seen the Reds in person once this year, but it was an away game at Jacobs Field in Cleveland.   The&nbsp;Bowling Green State University&nbsp;football team announced yesterday that they've signed an agreement for a home-and-home series with Boise State, starting with a&nbsp;BG trip to&nbsp;Idaho next season (2005).&nbsp; Besides their prolific offense, Boise State is known for their stadium and its blue Astroturf.&nbsp; That would be quite interesting to see in person.&nbsp; Idaho is a damned long way from Ohio, but with a year's notice, I'm hoping I can find a way to swing a trip out there for that game.   The news isn't quite as good for another&nbsp;BGSU athletic program.&nbsp; Rising sophomore guard Chris Hobson has apparently left the men's basketball program, and rising junior guard Steven Wright may be considering it as well.&nbsp; I'm a big fan of Falcons head coach Dan Dakich, but the past two seasons have definitely been sub-par and&nbsp;a lot of players have left the program.&nbsp; I'm personally willing to wait and see how the upcoming season plays out before making any judgment on his status with the team,&nbsp;but other fans are not as patient with Coach Dakich as I am.&nbsp; It's not a good situation no matter how you look at it.

      Last night was a bittersweet evening.   Today our friends Adam and Cricket are leaving, moving to Texas.&nbsp; Adam will be going to grad school down there, and Cricket got a job teaching music at a middle school.&nbsp; They've been planning this for a while, and last night it came time for us to have one last hurrah and then say goodbye.   It was a fun night.&nbsp; Brandi and I met Cricket and Adam and some other people at BW3, where it was Karaoke Night.&nbsp; The group was mostly made up of music teachers or vocalists of some sort, so this is something we do a lot.&nbsp; Brandi did one song, and tried halfheartedly to get me to sing one with her.&nbsp; I've done karaoke once, and I liked it, so it's probably something I'll do again at some point, but last night wasn't the night for it.&nbsp; I'm not a good singer, and I felt no particular need to publicize it.  We were there for a while, and then we went to Downtown to hang out and chat for a little while longer.&nbsp; Brandi was pretty tired, though, so we called it a night around 12:45.&nbsp; There were handshakes and hugs all around, and wishes for good luck and safe trips, but eventually we had to leave.  Brandi took it pretty hard.&nbsp; Cricket is one of her best friends, and both of them have been so busy that they never really had a chance for just the two of them to hang out together one last time.&nbsp; She was sad about that, and just that the fact that her friend was leaving in general.&nbsp; It was a fun night, but at the same time it sucks to see them leave.  Anyway, here's to Adam and Cricket.&nbsp; May you find Texas unbearable and return to BG in short order.&nbsp; Okay, I'm just kidding about that.&nbsp; I hope it goes well for them down there, but I do hope they make it back up here from time to time.   urlLink     Cricket & Adam, the guests of honor.    urlLink     Brandi & Cricket    urlLink   &nbsp;  Me & Cricket    urlLink     Brandi and I mourn the departure of Cricket & Adam (and the retirement of Ricky Williams from the NFL)...    urlLink     ...and then Brandi sings "Dancing Queen."&nbsp; (A crappy picture, I know, but hey, it was semi-dark and I have a mediocre camera.)

      Once again I find myself starting the day with a Mountain Dew.&nbsp; Today it's less because I need the caffeine to survive, and more because I needed something to drink and the water cooler is empty.&nbsp; The caffeine certainly won't hurt, of course, but I'm not as tired as I was for most mornings last week.&nbsp; Go figure, after a day filled with plenty of exercise and then a more typical short night of sleep, this morning I feel fine and alert.  It was a good weekend, and a full one, despite a lack of plans going in.&nbsp; It actually feels like the weekend was longer than it really was, and that  never  happens.  Friday was nice and relaxing.&nbsp; I got home from work at 5:30, as per usual, and settled myself in front of the PlayStation for&nbsp;a game of football.&nbsp; I played that for a while, and finished up shortly after Brandi got home from work.&nbsp; We went to Pizza Hut for dinner that night, which was exactly what I wanted.&nbsp; We just hung out in the living room for a while after that, and watched the Reds blow a game to the Pirates.&nbsp; Later that evening we went over to hang out with my friend McComas and his girlfriend Charissa.&nbsp; We thought about going out, but decided on just having a low-key evening with just the four of us (five, if you count the occasional interruptions of their daughter Kiersten, who was supposed to be sleeping).&nbsp; Brandi was pretty tired and headed home early, but the rest of us ordered some food, and I stuck around for wings and waffle fries.&nbsp; I eventually wandered home around 3:00 a.m.  We slept in well past noon on Saturday, which was nice, and then had a lazy afternoon.&nbsp; Eventually we managed to get ourselves moving, and we went to the grocery.&nbsp; When we got back, Brandi made tequila lime chicken for dinner, which was awesome.&nbsp; I cooked the chicken out on the grill while Brandi made guacamole and Spanish rice.&nbsp; We've had some good meals together, but this was definitely one of my favorites (and I helped!).  After dinner we decided to go out for drinks.&nbsp; We were kind of waiting to hear from McComas or Brandi's friend Cricket, but we decided to stop waiting and just go out ourselves and maybe meet up with the others later.&nbsp; We started at BW3 and hung out there for a while.&nbsp; Cricket showed up to say hi and to let us know she was staying in for the evening.&nbsp; We headed out after that and met up with McComas and Charissa at Downtown.&nbsp; It was fun to hang out with them again, although McComas grew quite agitated when we learned that Ricky Williams had retired from the NFL.&nbsp; Brandi and I finished the evening upstairs at Uptown, which was packed and good for a few minutes of people-watching.  Sunday got off to an inauspicious beginning.&nbsp; We slept past 1:00 p.m., and I didn't feel very well when I got up.&nbsp; Brandi headed out to run some errands while I stayed in bed.&nbsp; I stayed there for quite a while, actually.&nbsp; Eventually, though, our landlord called to say that our new apartment was ready, so I had to get myself going.&nbsp; I took a shower and got dressed, and then Brandi and I went down to do the check-in, and a short time later we started actually moving stuff in.  It seems a little bizarre to me, but the process of moving in was actually kind of fun.&nbsp; I started feeling better as we got into it, for one thing.&nbsp; It's also not like it's terribly hard.&nbsp; We're staying in the same building, just a few doors down (going from a one-bedroom place to a two-bedroom), so we made use of the building's continuous balcony to move stuff from one apartment to the other.&nbsp; We didn't get everything moved, but we made a pretty significant dent.&nbsp; We did move the bed, so we spent our first night in the new place last night.  We had to take a break in moving stuff to go to the store for a few things, like lightbulbs and a shower liner.&nbsp; One thing we bought was a popcorn maker.&nbsp; We eat a lot of popcorn, so we decided to get a machine dedicated to making it.&nbsp; I'll snap a picture of it this week and share.&nbsp; It sounds boring, but trust me, it's worth seeing.  I'm a little sore this morning from moving stuff, but I think I'll survive.&nbsp; At least I hope so, since there's still plenty of stuff to be moved.&nbsp; Luckily for us, we have until Friday to get it all done.&nbsp; There will be some difficulty in the fact that Brandi and I work different shifts, but I think we'll be fine.&nbsp; A good portion of what's left is the big stuff (couch, TV, computers, etc.), and we're still trying to figure out the logistics of getting that stuff moved.&nbsp; We didn't know we were getting the keys yesterday, so we didn't have a plan formulated.&nbsp; I don't think it'll be a major problem getting it taken care of, though.&nbsp; We also have to take care of the little details, like filling out change-of-address forms and getting our utilities switched over and all that.  One other item of note from this weekend:&nbsp; the title of  Star Wars Episode III  was announced to be  Revenge of the Sith .&nbsp; I like it.&nbsp; It ties in nicely with the original trilogy, especially since  Return of the Jedi  was originally supposed to be called  Revenge of the Jedi  (until George Lucas realized that Jedi don't take revenge).&nbsp; That movie will be released on May 19, 2005.

       urlLink Falcon Football To Hold Public Scrimmage   I haven't talked nearly as much about the upcoming college football season as I have about the high school season, but I'm just as excited to see the BGSU Falcons as I am the Troy Trojans.  It'll be cool to get a little sneak preview at this open scrimmage.  I went to the  urlLink spring game  back in April, which was fun, but this one will really whet my appetite for football.  I'm thinking about going home to Troy that weekend, because my brother Jim (who lives in  urlLink Kyrgyzstan ) will be in town, but I think I can probably make it back to BG in time for this exhibition.

      After yesterday's epic rant, I promise that today this blog will be a politics-free zone. I'm sure I'll get to it again at some point, and probably sooner than later, but today I'm offering a break. For you and for myself.  I just got back from my lunch break a few minutes ago, and I had a hard time dragging myself back into the office. I would have been content to stay in my car in the parking lot for the rest of the afternoon, grooving to music and enjoying the day. It's awesome out there right now. It's mostly sunny and 72°, with a pretty good breeze going. It feels, in fact, just about right for the beginning of high school football.  I know I talk about my obsession with high school football a lot, but on days like this I can't help it. There's a certain feeling in the air that just about prevents me from thinking about anything else. I'd love to be in the stands of Troy Memorial Stadium right now, just soaking up the atmosphere. It's a magical place for me. I've spent a lot of time there, and have a lot of good memories.  When there's a day like this that brings football so strongly into my mind, the feelings that come with it are always associated with the season of 1993. As school and football started up, I had recently turned 16 and gotten my driver's license. I was driving around in my first car, a light blue 1989 Dodge Omni (which I wrecked into a tree a few months later, which is another story for another day). The car didn't have air conditioning, so I always had the windows down, which was a pleasure on days like this.  It also didn't have a tape deck, so I generally just kept the radio tuned to the local pop/rock station ( urlLink Z-93  in Dayton) and listened to whatever they decided to play. I still have a fondness for the songs that were popular then, as they also can inspire these same feelings for me. Here are some songs I remember hearing a lot back in those days, off the top of my head:  "Looking Through Patient Eyes" - P.M. Dawn "I'd Die Without You" - P.M. Dawn "The Ways of the Wind" - P.M. Dawn "If I Had No Loot" - Tony! Toni! Tone! "I'd Do Anything For Love" - Meat Loaf "Angel" - Jon Secada "Boom! Shake the Room" - D.J. Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince "Dreamlover" - Mariah Carey "Insane in the Brain" - Cypress Hill "Two Steps Behind" - Def Leppard "All About Soul" - Billy Joel "Hey Jealousy" - Gin Blossoms  I'm sure I could come up with more if I really thought about it or looked into it, but those are the ones that come to mind right away. Hearing one of these songs, even now, is a treat. I actually still listen a lot to that P.M. Dawn CD during football season. It's not typical football music by any means, but it puts me in the right frame of mind.  I was a junior in high school then. I would generally get home on Friday afternoons and hang my Trojans flag out my window, and then drive over to Little Caesar's to bring home some pizza for dinner with my parents. After I ate I'd head over to the stadium to meet up with some friends and watch the game. That was quite an interesting time for me socially.  Days like today really bring this stuff back to me and put me in that mindset. It's an incredible feeling. This is part of why I'm so stoked each year for football season to arrive, so I can lose myself in that feeling for at least ten full weeks. As much I love sports in general, no other sport sparks this same intensity of emotion in me, and that's why I pine for football season all year long.  Twenty-two days and counting!

      In retrospect, I should have broken down my last post and taken it one topic at a time, spreading it out over several days of posting.  The problem with that approach is that it's all jumbled up even in my own mind, and that was just how it came out.  I was hoping to make one definitive post on politics and then leave it behind me.  However, I didn't get around to saying all the things I wanted to say, the length of the post notwithstanding.  That being the case, I'm sure I'll touch on politics many times between now and the election, and I'll try to clarify and expand things as I go.

       urlLink Political Compass   At long last, here is my promised and probably not-so-highly anticipated tangent on politics. It's likely to be long, and for that I apologize. I offer it in part simply to make sense of the whole mess in my own mind, and also just to provide some perspective and hopefully encourage readers to challenge (not necessarily to change) their own views.  The link above leads you to an online quiz that attempts to determine your place on the political spectrum. I have some question about the validity and wording of some of the questions, but at the very least it serves as a useful tool for stimulating some discussion.  Here are  urlLink my results . My scores place me pretty solidly in the Libertarian Left, along with such notable names as Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and the Dalai Lama. Being that solidly on the left side of the chart brands me as a "liberal," a label I've tried to deny due to the often negative connotation that goes along with it. However I suppose it's time to embrace it and move on.  What do our opponents mean when they apply to us the label "Liberal?" If by "Liberal" they mean, as they want people to believe, someone who is soft in his policies abroad, who is against local government, and who is unconcerned with the taxpayer's dollar, then the record of this party and its members demonstrate that we are not that kind of "Liberal." But if by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people -- their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights, and their civil liberties -- someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a "Liberal," then I'm proud to say I'm a "Liberal." --John F. Kennedy, September 14, 1960 ( urlLink Text of entire speech ) I must admit, I'm not an enthusiastic observer of politics. It's generally not something I pay very much attention to. That has changed somewhat over the course of this Presidential election campaign. Back in 2000, I felt that the election of George W. Bush as President would lead to disaster. It hasn't been quite as bad as I feared (at least not yet--he's still in charge at least through the end of the year), but it also hasn't been very good. Since I feel so strongly that Mr. Bush should not be in office, I've been paying more attention than usual to this coming election.  It has not been a pleasant experience. Politics in this country bring out high emotion in some members of the populace, and Americans in the grip of high emotion can be an ugly thing. There is a nauseating amount of partisanship and vitriol on both sides. If it was focused solely on the candidates I would be more willing to accept it, although I still wouldn't like it. It isn't, though. Conservatives (i.e. "Republicans") label liberals (generally "Democrats") as evil and stupid, and vice versa. Very few people are willing or able to have civil discourse about politics without descending into empty rhetoric and name-calling. This is troubling for anyone who is actually interested in hearing different viewpoints or engaging in philosophical debate. It's almost impossible to do so.  Beyond that, there's the issue of trusting the candidates themselves. We've become extremely cynical about the honesty of politicians, and with good reason. You never know how much of a candidate's bluster is believable. Even if they sincerely mean to do the things they say, there's no guarantee that they'll be able to. That's just the nature of our government system.  I think this is a large part of why so many Americans are totally turned off by politics. The mess of vitriol and dishonesty makes for an unsavory situation. It can also make it really hard to choose a candidate. All politicians (indeed, all people) have weaknesses that can be attacked, and it can be hard to wade through the muck to find out exactly what it is that they stand for. I know I wouldn't be nearly as interested as I am if I didn't feel it was so imperative that someone other than Mr. Bush is elected in November.  Since one of the things I hate the most about the political process is all the negativity associated with it, I will do my best to refrain from disparaging Mr. Bush himself, or those who support him. Instead, I will present my own views on certain things, and in some cases I'll point out where I disagree with Mr. Bush's views or policies.  I want to start with the highly controversial topic of abortion, because it's an issue that really polarizes liberals and conservatives and comes up in every Presidential campaign. I have to admit I'm a little baffled by that. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that a ban on abortions is unconstitutional. The constitutionality of a law is not determined by who is in office, and that ruling has stood up to 32 years of review. A Presidential candidate may be able to affect the scope of abortion laws, but it seems to me that the central issue is a dead one. Abortion is here to stay.  There are a number of other issues that are tangentially related to this one, such as gay marriage. I'm a huge believer in respecting (or establishing) rights of minority groups, and this just irritates me. The push to ban gay marriage is nothing more than legislating bigotry, in my opinion. Letting gay couples get married has no bearing on the "value" of a straight marriage.  Both of these things in general boil down to a number of people who believe that their religious beliefs should be the law of the land. Many of these people equate religion with morality, which makes me sick. I'm an atheist, and I'm a good person. The two are not mutually exclusive. There are different world views, and someone else's perspective shouldn't be forced on society at large.  This is perhaps the biggest issue I have with Mr. Bush. It's great for him that he has this deep faith in God, but he needs to be able to separate that from his leadership of this  secular  nation. He has been known to equate the war in Iraq and the battle against terrorism as a "crusade," and that terminology just makes me cringe. That tenuous situation could turn into a holy war very easily, and that would make things that much uglier.  The situation in the Middle East is another reason I'm against Mr. Bush's re-election. I absolutely  do not  feel safer with him in charge. His "lone cowboy" actions have turned a lot of sentiment against us worldwide, and his needless invasion of Iraq is one more charge against the U.S. We were absolutely justified in going into Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and search for Osama bin Laden, but invading Iraq was overstepping our bounds. Without question, the world is a better place with Saddam Hussein out of power. That doesn't change the fact that our reasons for invading Iraq in the first place were based on falsehoods. It has been decided that the President did not deliberately lie about his reasons, but instead based them on false information. That does not change the fact that the invasion was unnecessary, or that we could have discovered that if he had been willing to wait for U.N. weapons inspectors to finish their job.  In terms of security, I think John Kerry will make a fine President. Now that we're embroiled in the mess in Iraq we can't just pull out and leave, but I trust that he has a vision and a plan for our strategy in that area. I also trust him to focus on homeland security and do what he can to ensure our safety as citizens. We'll never be completely safe; it's just a fact of life. However, I do think he'll put more efforts into diplomacy, which will hopefully make a difference in how the U.S. is viewed by the world. Some say that this "appeasement" will make us weaker as a country, but instead I think that diplomacy and solidarity is a sign of strength.  I also think Mr. Kerry will do a better job with the U.S. economy. It's been sliding again lately, and indeed the recovery that supposedly started never quite reached this area. It's sort of interesting that Democrats are seen as "tax and spend" liberals, whereas Republicans are supposed to be fiscally conservative. Despite that, President Clinton balanced the budget and left a surplus, whereas Mr. Bush has turned that into the largest deficit in history in less than four years. The largest amount of job growth has always taken place under Democratic administrations. Mr. Kerry's economic plan calls for a rollback on Mr. Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy, and a new tax cut for the rest of America. This makes sense to me as a good way to jumpstart the economy.  Aside from individual and civil rights, which I touched on earlier, the main reason why I tend to be liberal has to do with creativity. This is just a feeling, mind you, but it seems to me that liberal politicians have more respect for creativity than conservatives. Conservatives tend to promote schools of thought that encourage logic and analyical thought to the exclusion of creativity. There's a place for that, certainly, but I don't know that I want it to be the dominant point of view. There is definitely a place in schools for arts and music. These subjects make a person more well-rounded, which can only help throughout the course of a person's life, even in such endeavors as business and politics. Beyond that, I fully believe that these things are the cornerstone of a truly happy and successful life--the quote at the top of my blog says it all, as far as I'm concerned.  I know I haven't explained all of this as well or as in-depth as I could, but I really could drag this out to an even more unacceptable length if I let myself. Please e-mail or leave comments if something I said caught your attention, and I'll be happy to elaborate. Otherwise, I just hope that this missive has been thought-provoking at the very least.  (Oh, and if you're still undecided...vote for Kerry/Edwards!)

      Someday soon, I've got a pretty meaty post to write about my own personal politics and the current Presidential campaign. That one is still brewing up in my mind. In the meantime, I offer yet another selection of assorted thoughts and notes.   Our company president has been missing in action so far this week. This matters mostly because our staff has been cut and reallocated so that he's essentially our only salesman, at least for capital equipment. Our head engineer has been dealing with sales calls in his absence, and that has actually probably worked out better. The only problem with this is that our head engineer is leaving at noon and won't be back for two days. Of course, our sales haven't been so hot lately anyway, but we have had a lot of inquiries. Should anyone want to turn an inquiry into an order over the course of the next two days, I think they're going to be out of luck. This seems like a fine way to run a business.   Today I'm finally going to get around to putting the electricity for our new apartment into my name. Somehow, in all the rush of actually getting everything moved, I've skipped this little detail. The electricity is still on, but I think it's currently being billed to the landlord. That probably shouldn't continue any longer than is absolutely necessary. On the flip side of that, a new tenant moved into my old place yesterday, and his electrical usage is currently being billed to me. So I guess it works out.   One thing that wasn't so bad about my tire experience yesterday is that the time I spent waiting to get the tire fixed was time I was able to spend reading  The Winds of War . I started reading it on July 15 and I'm just now about 1/3 of the way through it. I read quickly, but I'm only reading this one on my lunch break or whenever I find myself stuck somewhere with some time to kill. It is a superb piece of historical fiction. I'm in awe of it, actually. I've always been fascinated by World War II anyway, and Wouk has really crafted an interesting work by spinning a tale set in that period and really integrating historical fact into the story. It'll be a while before I'm finished with it, but I'm sure I'll dive immediately into the follow-up novel  War and Remembrance .   I'm also still working on  Song of Susannah , which I started even earlier than I did the Wouk novel. I said at the time that I planned to take my time with it, and apparently I was serious about it. I haven't had much time to read that one lately due to moving anyway, but I'll probably dive back into it pretty soon now that things are settling back down. I'm fairly close to the end. The next and final book in the  Dark Tower  series comes out on September 21, and I'll definitely be ready by then.   I know I said yesterday I would post some pictures from the Kerry/Edwards rally, and I haven't done that. As it turns out, I was so far away that Mr. Kerry is just a blue blur in the photos I took. I was hoping they would come out better, but unfortunately my camera doesn't have an optical zoom, and its digital zoom is nearly worthless. This is one event I definitely would love to have had a better camera for. At any rate, I may post some photos later anyway, just to show how packed downtown Bowling Green was on Sunday. It was utterly unbelievable.   Speaking of photos, I'd really like to take an afternoon to walk around the BGSU campus to take some shots to post on here. I'm sure I'll spend my share of time by the athletic facilities (Anderson Arena and Doyt Perry Stadium, at least), but there are some other spots on campus that I really like as well. Maybe I'll put that on my agenda for this weekend, if the weather cooperates.   I heard a radio commercial this morning featuring spokeswoman  urlLink Pam Dawber . Wow, really? Pam Dawber? I had totally forgotten she ever existed, and I'm probably not the only one. She seems like an odd choice for current advertising, to say the least. I was so stunned to hear her name, I couldn't even tell you what she was trying to sell me.    The Reds are on TV late this evening (they're playing in San Francisco), and as dreadful as they've been lately, I'm sure I'll probably watch.  They have to come out of their slide at some point, right?  Ken Griffey Jr. is supposed to be back from injury perhaps as soon as tonight, so that will help.    Another item I want to catch on television this evening is President Clinton's appearance on Letterman.  That'll overlap some with the baseball game, but that's fine.  I really enjoy hearing Clinton speak, and I also like Letterman a lot.  Having both of them together should be great.  I read something yesterday that said Mr. Clinton has been asked to host  Saturday Night Live  at some point.  I hope he does it.

      So, guess who ended up with a flat tire today. Go ahead, guess. I'll wait.  Okay, time's up. If you guessed  ME , give yourself a cookie. A co-worker came in from the parking lot this afternoon and informed me that my front driver's side tire was flat. I went out there and, indeed, it was flat. Another co-worker graciously assisted me in getting the spare installed.  Upon inspection, the reason for the flat was found to be a nail stuck in the tread.  Irritating, but at least it's something fixable.  Had it been jammed into the sidewall, I think I would have gone ballistic.  I probably picked up the nail on my lunch break, and the tire slowly deflated over the course of the afternoon.  The story does have a mostly happy ending.  After work I drove over to the local  urlLink Tireman  service center to get the tire patched and to have my tires rotated.  Since I purchased my tires there, this service was free.  That was a nice touch.  Along with  urlLink Midas , I now have a couple of places I don't mind taking my car for service or recommending to others.  There was one more item of irritation in store for me, however.  For a long time, I've had a problem with the button inside my driver's door that tells the car that the door is closed and turns off the dome light.  I've worked around this problem by taping nickels to the inside of the door to sufficiently press the button, and I never think to have it taken care of because it solves the problem so well.  However, while they were working on the tires, those nickels must have fallen off (it happens from time to time), and for whatever reason I didn't have any tape in the car to fix it again.  I managed to find enough adhesive substance in the car to work a solution long enough for me to get home.  I'll have to go down shortly and do a better job on it, and somehow I need to remember to have it looked at next time I have the car in for service.  Unfortunately, with the way my luck has been running lately, that probably won't be very long.

      Sometimes weekends go by without it feeling like there was a weekend at all. This was one of them, because it was so full. In some regards I don't mind that, but I definitely wish I had more time just to chill out and wind down this weekend. I could have used it. I feel pretty decent this morning, back here at work, but I am pretty tired.  Friday was actually fairly low-key, which was good because I was really tired. Brandi had taken the day off to clean our old apartment, so we headed over there when I got home from work. We had a few more things to move, and then we were finished. We left our keys there and left for the last time. Then we went to dinner at Easystreet Café in Bowling Green. They initially told us we'd have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes for a table. I don't know what happened after that (we went upstairs to wait at the bar), but we were seated within ten minutes.  After dinner we went to Wal-Mart, where we picked up still more things for our new place. The highlight of that trip was getting a picture frame that was supposed to cost $12.96 for the whopping sum of 96¢ due to a scanning failure. That was pretty cool. We went home after that and watched a movie.  Brandi had to work on Saturday. I got up when she did so I could move some stuff around and set up my computer. I set it up temporarily on the floor of the living room just so I could check the internet connection once the cable installers had come. They were supposed to be there between 1:00 and 3:00, but ended up coming around 12:15. They were there for about half an hour, and I'm extremely happy to report that the installation was successful. That seems like a no-brainer, but I've had trouble before. I messed around and played some video games after they left, and then moved some stuff around so I could move my computer to a more permanent location.  Once that was set up, I finally acceded to Brandi's long-standing request that I get a haircut, which I loathe. At least it's over with, and now I don't have to do it again for another couple of months.  She got home pretty shortly after I did, and we went for dinner that night at BW3. We played the interactive trivia game while we ate, and I got to watch a little bit of the preseason College Gameday special (albeit without sound). We went from there to Meijer, where we got still more apartment stuff (and some ice cream). We caught some of  Saturday Night Live  when we got home, and then went to bed.  Sunday was the day of the John Kerry rally in BG.  We got up and got ready, and left the apartment around 1:00.  We walked downtown, since we don't live too far from there.  The line was extraordinarily long.  We got into it around 1:30, which is when the gates were scheduled to open.  To make a long story short, I ended up getting through security a little after 4:00; Brandi had already bolted because the heat and sun were making her feel unwell.  I stuck it out, and it was worth it.  I really liked most of what Kerry and Edwards had to say, which solidifies my decision to vote for them (which I was going to do anyway, since I think a potted plant would make a better President than the incumbent, but it's nice to feel good about it).  I did end up getting a bit of a sunburn from the event, which is understandable since I was outside in the sun for about five consecutive hours.  It's not too bad, though--I used sunscreen pretty liberally (political pun intended) and only got a little burnt on my face and neck, probably where I sweated it off.  The thing that really sucks is that my pocketknife was confiscated by security, and I couldn't get it back.  It was only in my pocket because it's habit to carry it, and I would have left it at home if I had really thought about it.  The knife was a gift that I've had for several years, and I hated to lose it.  I was pretty worn out afterwards.  I showered when I got home to wash away the sweat and sunscreen, and then Brandi and I took a nap.  We slept well into the evening, then got up and had dinner while we watched  Forrest Gump  on DVD.  Then I did some more computer work (and finally got my old desktop up and running, after quite a bit of struggle) and then went back to bed again.  I'll post some pictures and articles about the Kerry rally sometime later today.

       urlLink Lewis Wants to Leave Falcons   I hate the offseason.  I've touched on that theme several times recently, at least in terms of it being hard to wait for the upcoming season. However, in those cases I was referring to football, and not basketball. In this case, it isn't because of anticipation for the coming season that I hate the offseason, but because crazy stuff is going on. The Bowling Green Falcons mens' hoops team is embroiled in a mess right now.  Guard Chris Hobson and forward Isaac Rosefelt have already left the program. Both were freshman last year and left ostensibly to find more playing time. Rosefelt may have required more development, but Hobson likely would have been a major contributor this season. However, they're both gone. There were also rumors that guard Steven Wright may leave, for off-the-court reasons not fully known, but that situation seems to have calmed. Steven is still listed on the official roster.  Ronald Lewis, however, is not. Yesterday Lewis, a rising junior guard, declared his intention to transfer to another school to continue his playing career. I was almost physically hurt when I got the news. Unlike Hobson and Rosefelt, both of whom played limited roles last season, Lewis was a known quantity. He was the Falcons' leading scorer last season, and 2nd team All-MAC. His athletic and often eye-popping play was one bright spot of the past two seasons, both of which were subpar in terms of actually winning games. Seeing Ron play was worth the price of admission. Needless to say, at first glance this looks like a huge blow to BG's program, and, in conjunction with the other departures that have taken place this offseason, could lead some to question the leadership of the team and where the Falcon program is headed.  As the day progressed, though, more of the story surfaced. In the article linked above, Lewis's mother comments on his goal to play in the NBA, and apparently that's at the heart of this matter. The story, as it was reported by the local sports radio station, is that Lewis was upset that the coaching staff had signed an  urlLink incoming freshman  point guard. He reportedly told the coaches that he needed to play point guard in order to reach the NBA. When told that his desire to play point guard wasn't in the best interests of the team winning games, Lewis reportedly replied that winning was secondary to him.  That story at this point is unconfirmed, but was said to have been reported by two sources. If indeed it is true, then Coach Dakich can absolutely not be blamed for Lewis leaving the program. Especially after two seasons in which wins have been in short supply, having a key player who puts personal goals ahead of the team's interests cannot be tolerated. That's not the way Coach Dakich runs the program, as any observer of the team can tell you. If Lewis actually said this, then the team is better off without him. If nothing else, team chemistry will be better with him playing elsewhere.  It also seems to me, after much thought, that this may not hurt the team on the floor as much as it would seem. Obviously, it's never a good thing to lose the scoring leader from a team, nor an off guard that rebounds as well as Lewis did. However, he did have a propensity for turning the ball over, and he wasn't a particularly good defender. He would not have been good in the point guard position--that's just not his game.  The roster as it currently stands can be seen  urlLink here .  The incoming freshman in question, Perrick Robinson Jr., will be able to play the point, relieved by incoming transfer John Floyd. Steven Wright wasn't particularly impressive running the point last year, but he can play there if needed (provided he does indeed return, which it looks now like he will). I think he can blossom in the shooting guard spot, and he can share time there with sophomore Austin Montgomery. Montgomery was inconsistent last year, and looked downright bad at times, but he also had games where he looked really good. If he can step it up, I think he and Wright can come close to replacing Lewis's scoring output. Defensively, this is an upgrade. It would have been nice to have Hobson to work into this rotation as well, especially on defense, but the Falcons should be okay with the guys they have.  The rest of the team, the frontcourt, should be decent at worst. Small forward John Reimold will be the heart and soul of this team, and provide the senior leadership and the main three-point threat. He's a fighter, and if the rest of the team follows him, I have high hopes. The rotation at that spot, however, is an unknown quantity at this point. Hopefully junior Germain Fitch will be recovered from injury and ready to play. If so, he'll also be a good leader for this team, and his contributions on defense, rebounding, and overall smart basketball will be a great asset. Incoming transfer Mawel Soler will figure into the mix here as well.  Power forward is something of a question mark, despite the fact that the players in question are both seniors. Cory Eyink has the build to be a bruiser down low, but he has a tendency to play on the wing and shoot three-pointers. He can shoot, but that's not what the team needs his main contribution to be. Josh Almanson is a heady player with skills, but was a little tentative at times last season after sitting out most of the previous season with an injury. He's an outstanding free-throw shooter, though, so getting him the ball will be key. These guys need to step up their game this year and play like seniors, and I think both of them will do that.  The starting center is almost sure to be sophomore Matt Lefeld, who played some last year in relief of Kevin Netter, who graduated. Lefeld is a tenacious defender who showed in his limited minutes last year that he has a lot of potential. He needs to stay out of foul trouble. He'll be joined down low by incoming freshman Scott Vandermeer, who will be thrown into the fire.  Coach Dakich, in the past, has shown a reluctance to give major minutes to freshmen. He'll have to overcome that this year just because of the sheer numbers crunch. The transfers Floyd and Soler will also be depended on to contribute. If these new guys come in ready to play right away, the Falcons may not win the MAC Championship this year, but it could be the year we start getting the program back on track. If they aren't ready, it could be a long season. Either way, it'll be something to see.  In the meantime, it will be interesting to see how this Lewis situation plays out.  He'll be granted a release from his scholarship pending the results of an NCAA invesigation.  There are some questions as to whether or not he or anyone in his family was contacted by another school prior to him requesting his release.  If so, that would be a violation of NCAA rules.  If that's found to be the case, I don't know what the consequences would be.  If not, he'll be free to puruse his NBA dreams elsewhere.  Good luck, Ron.  You were fun to watch and I hate to see you go, but your (alleged) attitude will hopefully be a better fit somewhere else.

      Those of you who pay attention to such things will notice a new blog linked on the right side of this page.  Those of you who don't pay attention to such things have no choice but to notice it now that I've called your attention to it.  This new blog is called  urlLink Read It and Weep .  Patrick, the author, is one of my best friends from high school.  It's good reading, and highly recommended.

       There was a time, in the early, formative months of this blog, that I wasn't concerned in the slightest if half the day passed and I hadn't yet come up with a topic to expound upon in this space. In those halcyon days of yore, my lunch break drive-time was occupied by "The Tony Kornheiser Show" on ESPN Radio. If I needed a topic, I knew Tony would provide me with one. Far from being just another sports talk show, Tony would touch on a little bit of everything. His show appealed to intellectual sports fans with a good sense of humor (and yes, such a creature does exist). The "Old Guy Radio" segment provided a pretty good soundtrack too.  Alas, those days are long gone, as Tony's show went off the air in March. Enter "The Herd," hosted by Colin Cowherd, which is just another sports talk show if ever there was one. I still tune in occasionally, but I have little patience for it. I love sports, but I mostly just want to watch the games and get some news. I have little use for most sports talk, which is little more than rehashing of standard opinions along with over-examination of minutiae, and an occasional call from a drunk sports fan thrown in for good measure. I don't put much stock in talking heads' views on sports--when I want a debate or opinion, I'll talk to my friends, where we can talk about the teams, players, and issues that we actually care about.  "The Tony Kornheiser Show" was an exception to all of that. When he talked about sports, Tony usually offered a unique perspective and some different insight from what was being spouted from other sports media personalities. The main reason I liked his show, though, was because it transcended sports. He would talk about pop culture, politics, current events, music, literature, whatever. That aspect of the show appealed to the Renaissance man in me, and it was often where I could cull a writing topic if none presented themselves to me through other means.  Tony said during his last days on air that he would almost certainly do another radio show on another network. To my knowledge, that has not happened yet, and it makes me sad. His show definitely appealed to a niche audience, but I think his departure from radio has dropped the standards and brought in just one more show appealing to the lowest common denominator.  Since then, I've been getting my Tony fix by reading his occasional columns from the  urlLink Washington  Post   (registration required) and by watching him and fellow  Post  columnist Michael Wilbon on ESPN's "Pardon the Interruption". Lately, even this has been denied to me, as both Tony and Mike are on a seemingly interminable vacation (PTI's hosting slots have been filled by Stephen A. Smith, Dan LeBatard, and Skip Bayless, none of whom possess the intellect or wit of Tony or Wilbon)--no columns have been forthcoming, and I've been skipping guest-hosted PTI in favor of my PlayStation. I'm hoping they (or at least one of them) will be back soon. Another week of substandard heads and PTI may lose its appeal and relevance.  There is hope for the future, however. This fall, a new sitcom called  urlLink "Listen Up"  will premiere on CBS. I'm normally not one for sitcoms or non-sports television in general, but this show is based on Tony's  Post  columns, and should be pretty interesting if nothing else. Starring as Tony will be none other than Jason Alexander, better known as George Costanza from "Seinfeld". The show premieres on Monday, September 20 at 8:30. That's opposite Monday Night Football, which sucks, but maybe I'll get a DVR before then.   ***UPDATE (7:16 P.M.)***   Word on the street is that both Kornheiser and Wilbon are in Athens to cover the Olympics, and won't be back together on PTI until the Games are over. I am less than pleased with this news. I guess this means I can just start playing PlayStation as soon as I get home, without bothering to check ESPN to see if they're on.

      Another weekend past, another week begun. This was my last lazy, do-nothing weekend for the forseeable future, so I did the best I could to take advantage of it. It probably could have been better, but it was pretty relaxing, and that's the main thing.  Friday was exceptionally low-key. I just played PlayStation football until Brandi got home from work. We eventually made it out to BW3 for drinks and dinner, but we didn't stay out very long at all. We turned on the Reds game when we got home, and Brandi went to bed shortly thereafter. I watched the end of the game and then stayed up to play more football.  Brandi had to work on Saturday afternoon, but I got to sleep in. I rolled out of bed around 1:30, which was very nice. I had a pretty lazy day, surfing the internet, playing video games, reading. I finally finished  Song of Susannah  by Stephen King, which I've been reading at a leisurely pace since it came out in June. It was pretty good, but it ended in an interesting way. I'm now looking even more forward to  The Dark Tower , which comes out in a little over a month. It seems like there are a lot of loose ends to be tied up in this one concluding novel, and I'm dying to know how King will pull it off.  Brandi got off work at 8:00 that night, so I drove up to Toledo and met her when she was done. We went from there to a party being thrown by one of her co-workers. That was a pretty good time. We hung out with a couple of her co-workers and their friends and had some good food, and there was a bonfire and a couple of dogs. Oh, and a limbo contest, which Brandi almost won. What else do you need?  We weren't awake for very long after we got home from the party. I watched some TV while Brandi did some stuff online. Then we put on a movie, and neither one of us stayed awake through very much of it.  Sunday afternoon wasn't much fun, but at least we got to sleep in. It was after noon by the time we got out of bed that day. Brandi went tanning, and I started doing some stuff around the apartment. We're still in process of putting everything away, which mostly needs to be done by this coming weekend so we can move in the rest of Brandi's stuff. I started working on that, and Brandi joined in when she got home. We actually made some decent progress, but I have a feeling that at least some of it is temporary. It definitely serves the purpose of getting stuff out of the way while we move in her stuff, though, and that was the main point. There's still some stuff to be done, but I'll take care of it over the course of the week.  The day got better after that. We went to the grocery for a few things, then came back and watched the end of the Reds game on TV while we made dinner and then ate. Then we napped for a couple of hours--I think we woke up around 10:00. We just hung out after that, watching  American Wedding  on DVD and eating popcorn. That's pretty much how the weekend ended.  So, it wasn't particularly exciting, but it was nice and relaxing, and that's what I was looking for. As I've mentioned before, the coming weekends will have plenty going on, so it was good to get a chance to mostly just sit around the house in advance of all that stuff. Next weekend will be a working weekend, as we take one last trip to Stow to clean out Brandi's old apartment and move the rest of her stuff back to Bowling Green.  There was plenty of moving going on in BG this weekend.  The university's summer session ended this past week, and graduation ceremonies and students moving into and out of apartments brought a flurry of activity to the town.  Already a lot of people are coming into town for the upcoming fall semester.  I noticed as I was out and about this weekend that a lot of parking lots are already starting to fill up, even though classes don't resume until August 23.  I like it, though.  The main attraction in living in a college town, for me, is the bustle of activity that is somewhat lessened when the main student body is out of town.  Tonight, of course, is the opening of football's preseason.  It kicks off with Monday Night Football, the preseason Hall of Fame game between the Denver Broncos and the Washington Redskins.  Despite the fact that it's a meaningless preseason game and rookies and backups will get the majority of the playing time, I'm excited for the game.  I love football.  You may have noticed.  Get used to hearing about it--as the season gets closer and then progresses, I'll likely be talking about it a lot.
