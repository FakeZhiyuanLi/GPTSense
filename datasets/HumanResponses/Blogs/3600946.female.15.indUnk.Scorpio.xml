      Yesterday I just laid around all day pretty much and watched Lifetime Movie Network.. Then my mom came home and we went to Red Lobster to get that Lobster and Shrimp thing for like 14.99. It was really good. And while we were there I saw Ashley Matias there, which was wierd b/c it was soo far away. Then we went grocery shopping and spent 100 dollars worth on junk. it was pretty uneventful really.   Today I woke up at like 11:15 or so. Then it started pouring down rain and the power flicked off. I had also let Ollie Bear outside and then it started pouring so I kept trying to call him in and he never came. He finally came in but he was soaking wet so I dried him off with a towel and held him. Now I'm watching another Lifetime movie called Touch of a Stranger. It is really good so far. After this is over I think I'm gonna go take a nap and be even more lazy than usual.

      So me and Chris are back together again. I know I may be making the wrong decision. But I really do care about him and he means everything to me right now. So I figure I better give it another try. Anywayz I hung out with Beth Chris Adan and Brian tonight.. again. I had alot fun.. Adan came over with some beer and for some strange reason I had this urge to like drink the whole thing in like 2 seconds. So then I threw up and I felt so bad that I threw up in Adan's car. So that's the last time that I'll be drinking for a long time, I'm sorry to say. Beth and Adan were really flirting on the way home. Chris drove us home and so Adan and Beth sat in the backseat. They are good together I guess except for the 7 year age difference.   Anywayz at my dad's I did absolutely nothing the entire day. I finished a book which was really good. Then about 5:45 we started going back to my house and I drove us there. He's not used to me driving so of course he was all nervous and everything but oh well. Then I got home and we went to Kohl's where I got 2 shirts which cost my mom like 30 dollars which isn't much. But I might take back one of them if it doesn't match this skirt.   Well I think I'm gonna call Chris.. I'm soo glad we're back together.. He is my everything. Nothing his love won't bring. My life is his alone. The only love I've ever known.  (A song from 98 degrees)

      Well I'm a perfect example of the quote-- "if he fools you once, shame on him; if he fools you twice, shame on you"-- somethign to that extent.. Me and Chris now broke up again... I really did think he cared about me. So we were on the phone and I said well if we have another big fight again I think we should break up and i was gonna say but I'm really gonna give it my all to make us not fight. I'm not gonna get mad at stupid things or yell at u or anything. And then he interrupts and says I think we should break up now. So I just kinda sit there thinking. And I was like how can you say that u love me if u just broke up with me and then he turns it all around and blah blah blah so I'm supposed to call him back later. I just don't know if I can be friends with someone who I've never had to be friends with before. I mean even when we broke up the first time we didn't hang out all that much and we still flirted and hugged and stuff. But this time it will be different I will not try and make him see that he is making a mistake. Obviously we arent meant to be together, so why should I try so hard to make it happen when it shouldnt.  However I can honestly say that he was the best thing that ever happened to me (as corny as that sounds) he really was. I never felt uncomfortable around him, he made me feel beautiful whether I had no makeup on or was all dressed up. I've never had a more fun time with anyone else but him. And I know it won't be the same if we are just friends. For one I know he won't call me when he goes to Basic he will have no need to. The girls on base will swoon to him and he was lay them all b/c he's like that. So I know he'll be more than happy there and won't give a second thought to me! I'm so mad at myself for believing that it was gonna be ok our second time around. Well I guess I'll go call him back and see what he has to say.

      Well so much for the shortlived life of me and chris not getting mad at each other. Lately we've been doing it alot then we decided to be nice and sweet to each other for like 3 days. And today it was back to fighting. I'm so sick of it. It's like I'll try and make it better and he won't. He will just stay mad at me or vice versa. Neither of us know what we should do about it and we really don't want to break up but we might resort to that if it doesnt clear up before he leaves. I'm so in love wit him but at the same time I'm so mad at him for being such a dick lately. If only he would say something sweet to me when I was mad it would clear everything up, but instead he has to get more mad.   Well on a lighter note, me and my dad went to Saltgrass for his father's day present. I really was gonna pay for it but he told me that it was too much for me to pay so I ended up just giving him 25 dollars which paid for his meal. Kinda pointless but oh well! At least I got a good meal out of it. I'm still full from it and we ate like 3 hours ago.  Well that was about my day today. I'll write more when I know more

      Yes, thats right anyone that doesn't know already.. Me and Chris are back together and have been since the last day of school... kinda funny b/c we started dating the first day of school broke up for a couple of weeks then started dating again the last day of school. But today was our 10 Month anniversary and the last anniversary that we will be able to celebrate together before he leaves in 20 days! We didn't really do anything but just hang out. He ran over and then he took a shower and was all sweaty and stuff. And then he left at like 3. I love being with him and can't wait til I graduated college so we can live together. I'm sure that sounds really stupid but I really feel like we will last that long. Every day that I'm not with him just makes me want to be with him more. We've been fighting alot lately. Of course the fights always start out being over something really stupid (mostly started by me) like us not being able to see each other or w/e and then Chris will start yelling and then I'll hang up on him because I don't want him to yell at me then he'll call back and get even more mad because I hung up on him. So we have been talking alot lately about breaking up but then yesterday I think he just had this epiphany and apologized for yelling at me and stuff saying that he never used to yell at me regardless of how mad he was.. and he wanted to make the last few weeks before he leaves better for us. And that he doesn't wan to break up because he really does love me.. and I really do love him also. So hopefully now everything will be ok.   I'm at my dad's now for another boring weekend at his house. I didn't get him anything for fathers day because his birthday was just in April and I didn't know what to get him. But I am taking him out to eat at like Saltgrass or Red Lobster and then we will prolly go to a movie or something.   Speaking of which The Notebook comes out the 25th I can't wait to see it. Chris is gonna see it with me.. It kinda makes me think of myself because they are in love then he goes to the military and they don't see each other for a long time and she settles for someone else.. And i realy don't want that to happen to me and Chris. My mom bought us the book but I don't think I'm gonna read it til after I go see the movie because the books are always better than the movie and I don't want to be disappointed when I see it.

      Chris is leaving on Thurs. So my last day to see him is tomorrow night. I don't think it's totally sunken in yet that he is leaving. I'm sure it will once he leaves my house tomorrow night at 12 at night when I won't be able to see him again. I know it's gonna be so hard for us during these 6 months or so but can u imagine the reunion between us? It's gonna be amazing! I'm gonna miss him so much and I'm scared to have to go to school and spend the rest of my summer without him. I have never felt more comfortable with anyone else but him. So I'm kinda anxious to see how things will work out with just me by myself here.
