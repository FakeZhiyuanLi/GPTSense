      Today on the most updated website ./ there was an artice (link at end).  " reverse firewalls should be embedded in every cable modem and wireless access point for home users. "A traditional firewall is designed to stop attacks from the outside coming in; a reverse firewall stops an attack going out'     The Story: http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/security/0,39023764,39154033,00.htm    [tinfoil_hat_on]  1. What if I where to have a good reason to send loads of e-mail?    2. Whould these firewalls keep logs, and if so, who would have access to them.    3. This sound alot like microsoft Trusted Computing project, bad idea  [tinfoil_hat_off]    -Joey

      I was reading ./ and saw this (http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/07/14/telecom.secrecy.ap/index.html) what it says is that ISPs and cell phone providers don't have to report outages. This reminds me of a time that a person in the government thought that by making it a requirement to have car insurance would lower the price.  -Joey

      [rant] I was reading this (http://slate.msn.com/id/2103823/) article and I'm not sure what is worse, A person getting 3200 e-mails from people tell him why they are tired, someone taking the time to write a story, or someone wasting bandwidth to host is. A above all it was on Slashdot. [/rant]  -Joey
