      Well hello everyone, the new Slipknot CD came out today you guys should all go out and buy!!! Here is their newest single Duality its an awesome song!    "Duality"  Push my fingers into my eyes...  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache...  But it's made of all the things I have to take...  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside...  If the pain goes on...  Aaaaaaaah!   I have screamed until my veins collapsed  I've waited last, my times elapsed  Now, All I do is live with so much fate  I've wished for this, I've bitched at that  I've left behind this little fact:  You cannot kill what you did not create  I've gotta say what I've gotta say  And then I swear I'll go away  But I can't promise you'll enjoy the noise  I guess I'll save the best for last  My future seems like on big past  You'll live with me 'cause you left me no choice   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!   Pull me back together  Or separate the skin from the bone  Leave me all the Pieces, and then you can leave me  alone  Tell me the reality is better than dream  But I found out the hard way,  Nothing is what it seems!   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  But it's made of all the thing I have to take  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!   All I've got...all I've got is insane...  All I've got...all I've got is insane...  All I've got...all I've got is insane!  All I've got...all I've got is insane!   I push my fingers into my eyes  It's the only thing that slowly stops the ache  But it's made of all the thing I have to take  Jesus, it never ends, it works it's way inside  If the pain goes on,  I'm not gonna make it!
