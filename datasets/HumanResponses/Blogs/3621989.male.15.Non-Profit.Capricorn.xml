       YaWn~,today sooooooo sleepy, although i had enough sleep last night, but i still took a 3 hrs long nap today. What i really did today was jus pure gaming , eating , watching TV. 1 more day of enjoyment, after that, 1 week of heavy studying i guess. Abit bad, because holiday homework so late start, last week of the holiday.   Today news mention, American hostage's headless body found. Oh My God, abit disgusting. Well, people out there, wants to seek revenge on others. But why are they so "wu liao" , making use of religious belief to gather 'free army', and launch attacks on others? Destroying things around them? Use the name of God来做坏事是不对的wor~~.Those people will not have a good end. To resist Terrorism around us, the only and sure solution is to stay ALERT and UNITED. This 2 words 'u know, and i know' stuff. But if really in our real life we need to use this 2 words to put into action. may not be easy(my opinion)?  Today topic i wanna discuss is --->* Is WaR InEviTaBlE ???*

       As you all know that currently theres a big event happening, that the EURO 2004. Soccer manic everywhere! Although it is a meaningful event to show who is the better cuntry in soccer, but people start betting on which country will win the match. The betting station even extent the operating hours to 2am! Just to let those 'gamblers' to have a chance to win $$$.Long long que in the betting station.Is Singaporean really that 'despo' to gamble? Some people don't realise the danger of gambling. Some even places heavy bets. Some think that the prize of the betting station is not atractive enough, then they will go for the 'bookie',place heavy bets there. Gambling,there sure to be lose and win. The winner went home with the pocket full of money, then what about the losers?? CoZ gambling produce losers, losers will produce LOAN SHARK. Illegal money lender will then appear to them, lending them money. High interest loan, can make the one who borrow the money gone mad. Too much to pay. Even if they can pay, they cannot clear the debts. Loan sharks did not receive money, creating trouble for the family, disturb and endanger the safety of the nearby resident.Sometime i think, why not people use those money on charity? More meaningful, and also make the society a much happier place to live with. The money spend on gambling > the amount of money given to charity.  Question(Anonymous): Does investment in shares consider gambling?? My Answer: For me, investment in shares is not gambling. Cos it apply some skill to it?not like betting, pure luck??  This friends of mine give the question above. That really tested me. Well, just a simple answer i given him.But what you all think? feel free to answer, face out ur opinion~!And ur comments and views about gambling!!~tAtA~

Saw benjamin with some 4m1 frens. they are in the TOP class, but when comes to BBQ stuff, they kinda throw money into the trash bin, so waste money. Well, that doesnt bother me, because it doesnt require me to pay? Haha. After that, me, immanuel, benjamin, wei loong, and desiree wanted to went pool. too bad, i did not bring my IC, so cannot go in. In the end we went to timezone. Play racing, oh man, today really down in my luck, they not plaing racing, but banging. Gosh from the 1st place, bang bang bang bang, until the 4th place =(. Haiz~. Sad right? After that went to the mini bowling at the arcade. Kinda shiok? cos every frame we shoot, it is either spare or strike, Haha. u know why? cos if the pins is not hit by the ball, i push it. WooHoo~In the end, we have enuff tickets for sweets. exchange for the SOUR sweet, WAHHH, damn sour taste. WOOHOO~2nd time. After decided to went home. Reach home about 7pm. so tired, legs so numb. then kinda went to sleep without notice?HaHa, woke up at 10:30pm? so sad, i miss one of the show. so on the computer and here writing my today entry.

       Anyway,  urlLink http://4m2.blogspot.com . click here to access to the class blog~  &nbsp;  Here starts my entry for today  &nbsp;  Hmmmm ..... kinda slow slow feeling this few days . Dunno wats goin on in me.  &nbsp;  "Love the things u're doin and in turn u'll be happy. Being happy will not cause u to love the things u're doin.Start from the right track and progress with careful steps for every pebbles in the path may be tripping traps or a stepping stone........", this is wrote by my 'sis' in her blog, hmm, did not ask for copyright, hope she dun mind~  &nbsp;  Maybe this few days i doin things which i dun like, thats why feeling so ......tired? i can't seem to control my every movement, decision. My physical and mental is not togther, both are not under my control. Sometime i regret why i did this or that and i hate regretting. Some action of mine, to others it might be kinda "funni", but for me, i dun wanna that to happen~. A sense of sadness in me, can't force it out. Stuffing inside me so as to let me remember the 'bad' thing i done. All fated?? i realli dunno the answer. to some maybe yes, to some maybe no~.Maybe i am lack of the reminder and encourage to drive me, motivate me. I canot afford to lose the precious time. Time seem to be running out for me. I cannot catch up the speed~, thats what i worried most.i am not complaining abt anything or everything, i just have this kind of feeling in me, which i never have before.I think i should take a rest, a nice and long relaxing rest~~~~&nbsp; &nbsp;  -Confuse little boy~  &nbsp;

       Today early morning rain, make me so cold, make my day so dead. The rain started at around 2am?? Not too sure. Had to bring my umbrella to school, kinda bulky, i dun like it =( but what can i do? I can't let myself get drench early in the morning. Money fly away so fast. $5 for the Hang-Ten Singapore T-shirt, $6 for the O level June paper. I am just given $30 each week. That means this week i cannot save any money, sob. Benjamin still call me go play CS this saturday, dun think i can make it. Becoz no money~. This world all need $$$ , w/o this u cannot do things that u want. You can buy almost all the thing in the world wif this thing. To some, they dun appreciate the importance of having $$$, some just waste it on stuff. Have u eva tot that the day when all ur parent lost their job, can the house do not have income ?? kinda scarey to me. w/o $$$ u cannot paid for the electricity, phone bill and stuff. For me, i cannot play computer!! sigh, why i sudden think so much?  Have you eva imagine......imagine......, how 'big' you are and how 'small' you are in this world? There maybe other kind of creature in this world that might be more clever than the human being? Or a bigger living thing bigger than the blue whale?  Or is there a 11th planet...12th...13th? What make the universe? How did human appear in this world? Is there really such thing as god? Why there must be war? Is there really such thing like Bermuda Triangle? Will there be a day where no one fight in this world? People will say that i think too much, but i dun think so. There are so many mystery in this world which some we really really cannot answer. Dun you agree?  Rainy day, thats what i scare normally bah. Weather suddenly turn cold, then i will have the running nose. hands and legs so freezing cold. Mosquito so active, bitting here and there, so itchy and whacky here and there. Still remember the days in Outward Bound. The tent that i using, the zip spoil.  I cannot completely zip up the tent, then the mosquito will have a fest on me. Can't sleep for the whole know, becoz it is just too itchy. On the third day of the camp, we settle down near the beach known as ' OBS CAMP 3'. that is when i get to experience the 'life in the dark'. there was no light in that place. The source of light which luminate the place was the city lights far far away~. Althought it seem difficult to survive at that circumstances, but i find it kinda easy? With frens around, i dun scare of dark  Hmmm...well gettin tired here, so thats all for today. Seeya~

       "有很多青少年说不知怎么跟父母讲话,有心事不如去找朋友.也有很多父母说不知孩子心里在想什么,不明白他们喜欢什么.这是很可悲的事.父母含辛茹苦把孩子养大,长大了却同陌路人,孩子们小时候绕滕撒娇的情景已经是永远不复现的回忆.这正是父母和孩子之间缺乏沟通的不良后果."  I found this phrase from one of the chinese book i have. For those who know how to read chinese character, don't u find it real? Communication between the parents and the children is very important. Don't know why i am so interested in this certain topic. HaHa  Now 09 august wor~. 39th National day leh. Wondering the parade nice or not. Last year parade in the national stadium, after that the stadium is gonna rebuild. Sad right?  Well...okok lah. Me going off although the entry very short, my eyes so tired, no choice. LoL~ see ya~!
