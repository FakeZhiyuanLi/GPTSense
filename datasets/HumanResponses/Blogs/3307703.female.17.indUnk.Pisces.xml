         I kinda don't know what to do about steve. I really like him and i think he likes me. I mean it seems like he's pretty interested. I mean, at least in being friends.  But we aren't like "Let's hang out" friends yet. Just like friends at church. I will see him a lot within the next week or so, so maybe i should just wait and see what happens. I wish Rachel could kinda help some how. Like cuz she knows him a lot better than I do. I have his sn but i don't really wanna IM him cuz every time i do that to a guy, everything goes wrong pretty much. Like i dunno. But yeah, so i'm a little scared...i should ask rachel what he would think if i IMed him. I also wanna have a party for the senior high. And i wish that the senior high girls could have a sleepover next weekend. I just text messaged alanna...we'll see what she says. But i would love it if we all had a sleepover again...maybe without the TPing this year. It was fun. I'd still TP if they all wanted to, but i don't think they'll wanna. That matter was kinda closed last summer. But anyways...woohoo! urlLink

              Well, i was happy today cuz brad called. I made him laugh...hehe. He's a cutie. I hop we become good friends. I really wish i could see steve more like i see brad. But it's fun hanging out with Brad. That would be so weird if he liked me. I dunno how i'd feel if he did. That would be cool and i'd be flattered, but i mean i really like steve. But me and brad are so similar...but me and steve are too a bit. Ok so Trish on the bachelor is a skanky bitch. I'm sory i swore but it's the truth. She's terrible. She just wants the attention on tv. I hate her. But anyway...i'm excited for brad to come over! woo hoo!!!

              So, the guy that i like a lot is Steve. He's really really sweet and funny and cute. I kinda think he likes me because, well, first of all, he totally used the best line ever on me. Ok, we were at a long choir practice for church at the diretor's house and we were on a break. I was practicing a new solo i had just gotten and about halfway into the break he randomly comes up to me and says "Geez Laura, I know I'm bad at singing, but you don't have to rub it in." LOL. Then we talked for a while. He was doing a play at school and I told him I really wanted to see it, and he told me when it was, but i was busy. But o well. I'm excited because we have another practice this saturday. :) So I have a devious little plan. LOL. Well, actually my friend says it's a cute idea but anyways. In my previous post i said how i was gonna show the prom dress to brad right? well, he and steve are like best friends, so steve will be sitting by brad and i'll bring a prom pic of me to show brad the dress, then of course steve will look too, and get to see how pretty i can look. tee hee. Well, hopefully i'll look good. Prom is this Friday. I wish I was going with steve, but i'm going with a friend. It's gonna be extremely fun. Well im excited! Yay! urlLink

              Ok, so next Saturday is Freestyle (a fundraising talent show that my youth group puts on)!!!! Brad and I are singing "Come What May" from Moulin Rouge and I think we sound really good. He wants me to wear this red, not very elegant dress, and I was fine with that but i'm thinking that I should wear my prom dress.  urlLink    It's dark hot pink and shimmery and elegant looking. It kinda looks like the red dress she wears on the movie cover. It'll look so pretty. I'm gonna ask brad saturday about it. And steve will, I hope, think i look gorgeous. teehee. But all my friends are coming to see it and i think the whole show will be really good! I'm excited to see everyone's acts!

      So I was just at the Disney website and they have a whole thing on each disney princess. My favorite one has always been Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), and i took a quiz, and it says that I am most like her. wo0t! Hehe. I also wrote a diary page. They have the cutest little diary page, so I wrote in it and it's so pretty! Yay! I have also been looking for designs for my homecoming dress. I've been looking at the barbiecollector.com website. There are so many gorgeous dresses! I also looked at the cinderella dress that she first has but the step-sisters tear it up. That one's pretty too!

      So, i'm working at vbs with the three year olds. I took this little boy to the bathroom 3 times and i had to hold him up while he peed. It was so exciting! *not at all*. So i'm trying to not like steve very much anymore. I don't think he likes me very much that way. Just as a friend I think, which is dissappointing, but o well. There's another guy i kinda like now :) So, Kraig, Josh, and hopefully jeremy and zander are coming friday to play n64 and maybe PS2. I'm excited!!! woo hoo. I really need to pray about this steve thing so i get over him painlessly. sigh

      So i am so lazy this summer. All i've done is sleep, eat, watch movies/tv, and play games. lol. I am awesome! But thsi thing with me liking steve, it's toned down a bit...i mean i still like him, but i don't get that little upsetting twinge if he doesn't talk a lot to me or IM me. Lea and I talk to him a lot. He's so funny. *sigh*. Anyway, I've been talking to Kraig a lot....he's so wierd (we're so alike). We are "soul mates" haha. We do like a lot of the same stuff. And I saw a movie with him, josh, and jeremy...lea's man...lol. And it seemed like josh and jeremy were scared or something since i was there. But o well...i try to rub off on everyone gradually. I think i come off strong, but i grow on people. It'll be fun on the bus to student life camp. I hope me and steve talk a lot then. But i'll prolly chill with the my three boys. DANIEL RATCLIFFE IS SO HOT! I love Harry Potter! I'm re-reading the 4th book now! Wooooooooo!

              I know...weird title right? Well there's a story behind it. Sunday night i was hanging out with a group from church and we were just hanging around the church. Well, Steve gave Renae a a "wrestling name"..grenaderade or something like that. Well later on he was like "hey Laura we could give u a wrestling name with Saylor." Then he was like "How about 'the Naughty Pirate' for your name?" I don't know if he realized it or not when he said it, but of course, the collin was like "um I don't think that sounds like a wrestling name." hahaha. It was cute. lol. Then also he complimented me on my singing again. He does that a lot. I love him so much. He's awesome! Also, he always makes an effort to talk to me...like after we saw shrek, everyone except me hated it, but he talked to me about it anyways. He's so awesome...i don't know why he doesn't have a girlfriend yet...i wish he was mine. I wish there was a way to hang out with him with like Brad and Rachel or something...like not the main "popular" kids at church. I think i would act more normal around him then. But at least I talk to him online. tee hee. O ALSO!!!...i am losing weight...i've already lost some...i really wanna be thinner by student life camp. I know i'd have a better time and be able to focus on God more. I know that's bad, but sometimes it gets to me so much...the way I look, that it gets in the way of my relationship with God. It used to get in the way all the time, but not nearly as much anymore, but i think it would at camps.

      Well today I got my senior yearbook pic taken. Not all my senior pics. When I get thinner we'll get those done. I'm gonna have so much fun with choosing outfits. I might do my guard outfit for this year. And I def want a pic with my dog. But anyways....i looked really good for my pic today. I was worried I wouldn't, especially acne and such on my face. But I looked good. I really hope people don't think i'm stuck up cuz i say that i look really good a lot. Like I'll just be like "I looked so good that day!" I think I'm making up for all those years where I always said I always looked ugly. I never thought i looked pretty. But anyways...I'm excited to get my pics back.

      Well, I'm pretty sure Kraig will never really like me again. If he does that's cool, but i don't think he will. He seems to change his mind quickly. But anyway, I'm just gonna forget that all ever happened. O well...it's ok. But it would be cool if God sent me someone this year. I thought he had, but o well. I don't know if Kraig was right for me anyways. I mean he might have been, who knows. But, i mean, his fave movies were the Alien movies...I hate alien movies. lol. But anyways, now i won't be cheating on Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom. lol. They were getting jealous. hehe. so I just thought i'd tell everyone that.

      Well, I just got back from Student Life Camp Friday night. I must say, it wasn't the best camp I've ever been to. I liked centrifuge a lot more, well in certain respects. I liked Student life camp over the other because of rec. Normally I hate rec because it's sports and stuff. (I hate sports anyway, but guys are so competitive.) But at this camp it was fun, simple games that anyone could do. I enjoyed that...even though i got a little sunburned even with 45spf sunscreen on! lol. Anyway, this camp wasn't as spiritually challenging as others i've been to. I loved my family group (Bible Study) leaders, but the curriculum they had to teach us was so surfacey. Pretty much all it was was "God loves us so much that He sent his son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins." Well I mean, Yes that is the most important thing to know and it's very good to be reminded of that, but when i go to these camps I expect to really be challenged and forced to think. That didn't make me think at all. Also, the Camp Pastor was such a funny guy, he really was. But I didn't like his preaching. I mean he had good messages, but i didn't think he really had a point in his messsages. He was hard to follow becaue his sermons weren't organized at all. But, I bought his book. Hopefully I like it. I think I will.  He's blunt. He tells people the truth even though they don't wanna hear it. He's awesome. Anyway...never trust jr. high girls. LOL. They can't keep secrets. haha. I had a lot of fun with all the girls in our cabin. There were 8 of us. It was really fun. Although I think we scared Katie with our "grown up girl" talk. Well, actually it was kind of funny. She was scared of my bra. She was like "It's just so big!" hahahahaha. We all thought that was cute. I love that girl. I can't believe i'm gonna be a senior in high school! But anyways...I knew that during camp i would be so focused on Kraig because of everything that had happened the week before. I was constantly praying everyday multiple times a day that God would help me focus on him and not Kraig, and everyday that request gradually came true. The very last worship service, thursday night, was where i was completely thinking of God and only God. It was the most wonderfule feeling. Whenever i start to focus on Kraig more now, I just think of the line from a song: "Nothing I desire compares with you." And that turns my eyes upon Jesus. Sometyimes I just can't believe how so many people in the world can't believe in God or that Christ died for us. But i think i said this before, but i'll say it again. I think the reason i was so upset with everything that happened with Kraig was that it was so fast! It felt like only an hour had passed. Then we didn't get to talk and o man I fell apart. But now that i have been re-focused on God, things are so much better. I'm...well....sane. I'll end with a song: "I love you Lord, and I lift my voice, to worship you, oh my soul rejoice, take joy my King, in what you hear, may it be a sweet, sweet sound, in your ear."

      I can't believe it's already July! That seems nuts. Tomorrow I am going to 6 flags with friends. I totally forgot that the Superman ride was there...I still haven't been on it or deja vu. That makes me a horrible person! lol. I am reaLLY excited though. It'll be really fun. Today I saw Spiderman 2...IT WAS SO GOOD!!! Well, Kraig told me that he was too stressed to be in a relationship right now, so we aren't exactly going out officially now. But that's ok with me. I mean, after i made a complete idiot of myself. At first i thought he just wasn't interested anymore, and i was sitting there balling my eyes out, cuz i really like kraig. Then after an hour of explaining to me that he still liked me and wanted to go out with me after we became much closer, it finally clicked...I'm so slow, lol. I feel terrible about it though. I was kinda trying to make him know i was very upset. But then again I also had a severe case of PMS. I was so emotional then and this whole past week. I'm hoping he knows about all that girl stuff. LOL. But this week i've just been missing him really. I really wanted to do something with him this week, but his g-parents are here and he can't do stuff with friends when they're here. I wish he was going to 6 flags with us. We haven't talked a ton lately, but I hope we talk a lot on the bus to camp next week. Camp is gonna be soo fun!!! I'm excited!!! He's so wonderful...i act like a moron and he still likes me, and i say stupid things and he forgets all about them. gotta love him! But i think he still thinks i'm mad at him, but i'm not! Just to let you know kraig! lol. You're too awesome! ttyl ya'll!
