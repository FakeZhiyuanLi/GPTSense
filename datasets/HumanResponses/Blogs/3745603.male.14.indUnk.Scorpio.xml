      If you don't kow what Family Guy is, then you are crazy.  It is the best show ever created, al least, it was.  Foxcanceled the maing of FG after 50 episodes, and it hasnt appeared sence.  Re-runs show on Cartoon Network at 11:30pm, but those are no fun.  Due to the millons of FG DVD's sold, production is beginning again and (i think) 30 new eppisodes will be ready by January 2005, (or so i hear).  For the latest FG comeback news, or for the good old trivia, wallpapers, news, sales, games, features, and entertainment relating to FG, here are some links to my favorite FG sites! (links listed in order of favorite, to not the best, but still pretty damn  good) http://quahog5news.com/ http://www.familyguyfiles.com/main.php http://www.planet-familyguy.com/main.php http://evilmonkey.tv http://quagscorner.com

      Im really excited about having my own blog.  I'm not exactly sure what im going to post her yet, but it will probably end up being about my interests and random topics.  For example, cool music, (the return of) Family Guy, my Tech Camp, stuff about WJ, and loads of other stuff.  Remember to check often to see if i have posted anything that meets your interests as i will post things quite regularly, (bcuz i have nothing else to do).  Okay, until my next post, peace out!

      I woke up to the sound of the doorbell today and to my suprise, there was Heather from 6th grade and her brother Anderew, acompanied be Peter and Ross. I had just thrown on some clothes and the basement was a MESS! It was really cool to see her again bacause she has changed so much. We hung out in the basement for a while, then went down to the rope swing in Rock Creek and hung out there for a while. If you havnt already heard the miserable story of what happened last summer, in a nutshell, she owes me and Peter a big favor. She didnt get to stay long today, so me and Pete didn't get our rewards. Heres the thing, since she couldnt stay for more than 2 hours, she'll be back tomarrow! Cant wait. Oh, and in case u havnt seen her in a long time, heres a pic from today. Peace!!

      Ok, today i went to see iRobot with Peter and Ross.  Despite what reviews may say, it is a kick ass movie.  Will Smith is great in it, and the plot is not bad.  It's kinda like a more realistic Matrix where the robots revolt and try and take over the world.  Pretty cool.  As we were leaving, they handed out drugs to everyone.  Is that legal?  Anyways, we decided to roam the mall for about an hour, then he hung around outside, talking mostly about diseases and chicks.  Then my dad came and picked us up, and now were all sitting here in my basement watching Monk and eating stale cake.  This is the good life.  Peace!!

      I just got back from mowing this dude's lawn and i am so beat.&nbsp; I was in a real hurry to get it done so i could leave, but the self propelling mechanism on the mower was broken, so i RAN the lawn mower around the 1 acre property, *panting and sweating more than Martha in the courthouse*.&nbsp; I also have to babysit tonight for about 5 hours (which is about 31.25 dollars), no thats cool, plus it's a great place to get that summer work done, because the people dont have cable.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Enough complaning. Im going to go watch Family Guy and eat bon-bons.&nbsp; Peace!!

      Im very tired right now, but i cant go to sleep.&nbsp; I helped peter get a blog today ( urlLink www.peterspeaksenglish.blogspot.com ) so check it out for him.&nbsp; If you don't have a blog yet, i highly recomend you make one.&nbsp; It's so much cooler than livejournal and all the other sub-profiles you see on all your buddies profiles.&nbsp; Make one at  urlLink www.blogger.com  and send me the URL.&nbsp; Im watching last call right now, which is the worst late night show i've ever seen.&nbsp; Im only watching it because Conan is over and im not sleeping.&nbsp; Ho Hum.&nbsp; After MUCH debating about returning to BAPA to do Chicago, i decided that i would go in, but not until the end of next week.&nbsp; Im just starting to work on my summer school work.&nbsp; By the way, if you need 'help' with the bio packet, let me know.&nbsp; Peace Out,&nbsp; *Yawn*.

      I realized just now why they call it a   Cast   Party. It's so that it doesnt come out of the tech budget!! It was amazing. My first high school party. They guy who was having it at his house has earned every drop of my respect because he built his own recording studio in his basement. It looked amazing, but when i looked around closely, i wasnt exactly impressed. He was using dynamic mics for recording, (a no no), and had about 4 synthisizers, (synthisizers are icky). It was cool though. The actors are even cooler offstage than they are onstage. The guy had a pool in his backyard, so naturally, with all their clothes on and no towels or anything, they ALL jumped in. The techies managed to stay dry until the actors realized we weren't in. The next thing i knew i was soaking wet with out time to take my shirt or shoes off. We played a few games like cranium, and the typical party game involving a bottle and a circle of people, *wink*. Then the actors decided to play truth or dare, a game which the techies happily sat out of.  (just to let you know, it is just as fun to watch truth or dare as it is to play it, and much less humiliating).   About 5 hours later it was time to say goodbye. Very emotional. We all exchanged emails and sn's, then said goodbye. Sad. I have some pictures of the party below. There, now that you have the summary of my time at BAPA, i will stop posting about it, (till my next gig there) and resume my normal, yet still slightly annoying, posting habbits. Peace!!

      Tonight's show went GREAT!!!  Tonight was the night that my family and friend came, so im really happy that it went so well.  The only bad about tonight is that it's closing night, and is sad, because the actors are really cool, (by FAR the best cast i've ever worked with), and the entire tech team is going to miss them.  Most of them will be back next summer, but a few are going off to college.  Oh well.  I got most of their screen names so that i can keep in touch.  Im really happy i was able to work on this show.  I've decided to not do the Chiago show for multiple reasons, so this is my last time here this summer, but Adam talked to me about jobs during the school year.  Paying jobs!!  If that turns out to be nice, i may just ditch S*T*A*G*E and go work there after school.   Although im really sad about leaving, it's not over quite yet.  We still have strike tomarrow, and the cast party.  ROCK ON!!!  I have a feeling it will be a good time time.

      Tonight's show went considerably better, in comparison the the opening, (below).&nbsp; Maybe it was because it wasnt out first time through the entire show, or maybe it was because we didnt&nbsp;have so many tech problems.&nbsp; My only problem is that Alison, the stage manager, is not exacly...&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ball.&nbsp; She called so many bad Q's that it made me look bad, not to mention her staring at me when it happened, so as to make others think it was my fault.&nbsp; What do u expect from a rookie SM, (besides me)?&nbsp; About half way through, the lights flickered, and all the techies stared at eachother, (while missing a Q) with desperate, helpless faces. &nbsp;Other than that , tonight's show looked very good and i was happy with it.&nbsp; If you want to see it, we still have one more show tomarrow, but that will be it.&nbsp; After that, we will stike Macbeth, and i will begin work on Chicago, which will be showing in late August. Till later, peace out!!

      Tonight was opening night for Macbeth.&nbsp; Very stressful.&nbsp; Let me walk you through it, in a  very  rough fasion.&nbsp; I arived at bapa at noon to run through some stuff and practice some hard Q's and it turns out that the director decided to take out about 10 Q's, and add some in other places (LOTS of work for Kevin).&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this change, they took out the apperation videos meaning one less impossible job for me.&nbsp; Thank god!&nbsp; So everything is going well, despite those little butterflies that still manage to get in my stomach, until the house opens at 7:30.&nbsp; As you know, if your in the area, there was a really bad thunder storm going on at the time.&nbsp; As luck has it, lighning knocked out power to the building for just about 2 seconds, but 2 seconds is just enough time to knock out the light dimmers and control board. Not good.&nbsp; After reseting the dimmer rack and the board, we encounteres yet another problem.&nbsp; The board would not communicate with the dimmers.&nbsp; No lights.&nbsp; The director quickly decided to use the worklights (crappy florescents) for stage light, which really sucks because a lot of my sound Q's are based off the light changes.&nbsp; Finally, on my first Q during a blackout, the lights began to comunicate, therefore creating a beautiful spectrum of light filled with gobos and gels.&nbsp; Heaven for the eyes of a desperate technitian.&nbsp; Please excuse my shakespeareian writing style, as it is all mine&nbsp; ears have savord for the past time.&nbsp; Anyway, the show got up and running. Overall, it went pretty well, concidering it was our first actual runthrough (cool, eh. A dress rehersal at an openng show).&nbsp; Naturally there was a wrong Q here, a missed Q there, but hey, what do you expect from a cursed play?

      This week is hellweek (also knows as tech week) where the whole tech aspect of the show comes together.&nbsp; I have officially been assigned the job of soundboard operator.&nbsp; Sweet.&nbsp; Im not sure if people will like the set that we built. You see, the new thing is to put a twist on Shakespeare plays to make them more interesting and origional.&nbsp; The show im doing (Macbeth) has a weird theme that i dont think clicks.&nbsp; It's s oposed  to take place in 'post-epocoliptic' times, so the set, aostumes, and props are really trashy.&nbsp; Unless they make it clear that this is the theme, i think that the house will think that we just had an extremely low budget and that BAPA fired the painters and costumers.&nbsp; I don't really like it. There are caged lights hanging from the ceiling and the costumes are made out of, get this, shreded tower records bags.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, i think this is all because were saving our budget for the August show (chicago) which by the way i might be working on too.&nbsp; I contacted them about working on that too so, lets see what happens.&nbsp; This will surely beef up my resume. Ho Hum.&nbsp; Okay, i have to go study my over 40 Q's for the show.   **yawn while falling asleep at computer**

      I LOVE THE RAINFOREST CAFE!!! Yesteday, my family went to Tysons and for lunch we stopped at the Rainforest Cafe.&nbsp; If you don't already know what it is, it is a HUGE resturaunt and bar (so big that the staff wear headsets)&nbsp; that looks and feels just like a rainforest.&nbsp; There are huge anamatronic animals such as elephants, gorrilas, tigers, and large insects.&nbsp; They also have a huge waterfall and even rain.&nbsp; Every once in a while there is a 'thunderstorm' with sound effects and strobes.&nbsp; the entice celing and walls are covered tith plants and animals, and huge rainbows are projected on the walls.&nbsp; They even have&nbsp;a hude tropical fishtank arch you could swim in, and many other tamks seperating tables and on the walls.&nbsp; The food is crap.&nbsp; if you havnt been, you gotta go.&nbsp; It is the coolest resturaunt enviornment EVER.&nbsp; Peace Out!

      I hate the greek guy at the barber shop next to China Gormet in Kensington.&nbsp; MY dad said, 'Kevin, your hair looks like crap' so went to get it cut.&nbsp; Now, i think everyone knows im not a huge fan of long hair (Bren), but i dont exactly like buzz cuts.&nbsp; So i walk into this place and im like 'Yeah, just a little trim' and the guys like 'WEDXJKTYKVULNOIGHKHD'&nbsp; and whips out the buzzy thing and starts attacking my head.&nbsp; i walk out of there, take 1 look at myself in the car miror and im like 'AHHHHHHHHHHHH'.&nbsp; It is so fucking short and it makes my ears loook EVEN BIGGER!&nbsp; So now im a little miget with huge ears and no hair.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; Hopefully i wont still look like this for more than a week.&nbsp; Hey, at least it's not Trump hair!

      For this years Fourth of July celebration, i went to my aunts appartment in DC. From her roof is a beautiful view of the Washington Monument, the Capitol, and the space where they set off the fireworks. I had brought my video camera and everything and i was ready to film, and more importantly, see the fireworks. Well, it turns out that the wind was blowing EXACTLY in the direction of the building, so after the first firework (which i missed) the entire sky in front of the fireworks was covered in smoke. We could not see a single firework, it only looked like a huge, backlit cloud that would soon engulf the building and scrw up everything. I actually got some of this depressing spectical on camera. Below is a picture of the unfortunate event. Anyway, soon after realizing that our location sucked and that it wasnt going to get better, we went back to my aunt's room and watched ABC where they were showing the fireworks from a much better angle. Just so that i would feel that the night was not a total waste, i videotaped the TV where they were showing it's. If you think you had a worse experience, or would like to brag about your own glorious time, feel free to comment on the link below (and yes, i do read the comments).     Peace Out!

      Sometimes when im just going to rant, i cant think of good titles. Maybe ill just start using names that Mike and i made up when he was starting his band, (befor he picked 'Lime Kuler' or something like that). I've already stole some of them, like Soup of the Day was my idea, he didnt like it, so i stole it for this here blog. Also, we made up Dark Matter, which is now my email adress, ( urlLink darkmatter08@hotmail.com ). Wasted Talent however i stole from Family Guy, where it was the name of one of the episodes. I have already explained the 08. You can tell im either bored as hell or tired, or maybe drunk when i ramble like this. Actualy im anoyed because i have to cut about 4 lawns today and tomarrow. It pays well, but it's a real pain in the ass... and back and legs and arms. Im really excited because, as you may already know, my aunts co-worker has a neighnor who is in charge of lights and sound for the opera at the Kennedy Center, and on September 9, i get to go to a dress rehersal for the new opera and afterward, maybe go on a full tour of the theaters. Sweet. This summer i have gotten so much experience with my tech stuff, not to mention my resume which is a page longer ow. Wait, i did mention it. Huh, thats a weird phrase. Ok, go back to your life, and just for future refrences, you dont have to read all the posts, because some are good, and some, like this one, are just long and unamusing. Oh, and one thing. Brenda, i got all these new shirts, and almost no horizontal stripe! lol. You would be so proud of me, i can dress myself. lol. Peace!!

      Yesterday was probably the best day I've had all summer. I will start where I left off on the last post. So, my mom drove me down to my aunt's office in DC. I had no idea that she worked in such a sweet place. When you walk out of the elevator on the top floor, the first thing you see is the boardroom, which looks just like the one from the Apprentice, except with windows on 3 sides. The entire office was huge, and wrapped around in a huge circle. She walked around and introduced me to her co-workers who are all very nice, and some of whom had very good connections. This one woman has a neighbor who works with sound and lights for the opera at the Kennedy Center, who will try to take me on a tour. The Kennedy Center really is an amazing place for both tech and performers. Anyway, we hung out at the office for a few hours, where I did work like copying stuff, alphabetizing time-sheets, and re-stocking the sodas in the lounge, then ran down the street to Luigi's where we got pizza. Then we headed out to the K center and , well, went to the show. In a nutshell, the show is about these 2 guys who have an idea to make a lot of money by collecting lots of money, then produce a show that will be terrible and close quickly, so they will be able to keep the money. They pick a show called 'Springtime For Hitler', hire an extremely gay director, and hire the worst actors. Instead of flopping, the show does really well, they lose the money, and go to jail. They get out and bale bale bale. The End. It was a really great production and the tech was phenomenal. I know it sounds gay, but I did like this show, (oh and there were a lot of sex references and dirty jokes, so it was actually pretty funny). Peace!!

      In about 20 minutes i will be leaving to go downtown and see  The Producers.   Im really excited to see this show, as it has gotten awesome reviews.  Annelise (Frey) went to see it last night and told me that it was awesome and that the music is great.  I think im going to Cissy's (aunt) office first, then to dinner, then to the show.  I might even spend the night at her apartment, but i dunno.  Ok, ill write my own review tomarrow.  Peace!!

      Ok, this morning i woke up to my dad shaking me and asking, 'hey kev, u wanna go down to the driving range and shoot a bucket'?  Technicaly this was my first time, so i kinda sucked.  The first few tries i missed the ball completely, which is very embarassing when you have milionaires who are really good all around you.  About an hour and 200 balls later, i had developed a really nice swing and was able to hit the ball about 110 yards with a 7 iron.  Not terrible, but definetly room for improvement.  After that my dad and i headed for the AT&T store to replace my old phone that died, (my it rest in peices).  So i got this nice Sony Ericsson T616 (google it, it's hot looking) and is a really good phone.  I then went home and hung out for a while, ate a Continental, (oh yeah), steak & cheese sub while watching FG.  A while later my aunt came over and we all went out for Afghan food for dinner.  I LOVE the green hot sauce.  My cousin and i (the one who cant cook a cake with me without disaster striking) once had a green sauce chuging contest.   I think we finished a few bowls.  Most people asumed we learned our lesson, but to tell the truth, i'd do it again in a heartbeat.  So, dinner was really good and now im home eating ice cream and watchng Jon Stewart.  So yeah, im having a pretty good day, and if you don't mind, im going to go finish it now.  Peace!!

      I want over to Brenda's house today. If you knew us when we were going out, u know that she was taller than me. NOT ANYMORE! Im about an inch taller than her, without shoes. Dreams do come true. Her brother Gregory is a really cool kid. He likes to film and edit movies, likes James Bond, and teases brenda, just like me, (sorry Bnut). So, i watched his movies, watched thier baby videos, (which was suprisingly amusing), and hung out in B's room. She just got back from Hawaii, and she brought me back this T-shirt with all there sea turtles, (my favorite animal), in a horizontal line. Anybody who has seen my wardrobe knows that most of my shirts consist of a horizontal stripe. Im trying to move away from that now. We mostly sat around, talking about nonsence, and listening to music. I got my class shedule today, above, and none of me and bren's classes match up, but i think my schedule will change a little. Ok, im tired, and i still have to make a post about my class list so, until then, Peace Out!!

       On my way home from dropping off annelise at camp, we stoppes at a cofee shop and look what i found sitting on the counter.  The title, by the way, was going to be the name of Mike's band, but then he changed it to his grandmothers maiden name or something.                 Cool eh?

      I havnt been updating this weekend because i have been so busy.  Now, just to warn you, im about to go on a ant, so if you have better thinds to do, by all means close this window and do them.  Now, this weekend began by me waking up saturday morning to somebody throwing something at me, then i went and mowed a neighbor's lawn ($25).  Then i hopped on my bike and rode over to my god-mother's house to cut her lawn ($20) and while i was over there Rafi rode by.  We talked for a sec, and i think were going to do something this week, (Rafi, if your reading this let me know, we should go golfing!!!)  Then i walked home and looked online for the rest of the day for expensive crap for my recording studio.  Then this morning i woke up at the un-godly hour of 8:30 to drive my sis to her camp called Rim Rock.  She'll be there for two weeks and the weird part is i think i might actualy miss her a little.  I mean, i've had her around all summer, but having her gone even a few hous is, well...         quiet.  Then i got home, and mowed the lawn at the other house ($15), then went over to my grandparent's house to saw up this huge branch on thier garage roof (priceless).  They wont be around much longer, so i dont mind helping them.  Ummm, any last comments?  Oh yeah, Mike sucks at updating his blog and snails are slow.  Peace!!

      Today is my mom's birthday! This morning, she and my aunt (her twin) went out to lunch with my cousin and i stayed home and watched her son and my sis. About 75 minutes later, they came home, droped Kristen (cousin) off at our house and that is when we bagan our secretive plan of making a cake for my mom. We had chosen New England Fudge Cake, a family recipe, and my moms favorite. We bagan by sticking the little guy in front of Family Guy, which i have learned is not the best show for 3 year-olds. We had found the recipe somewhere on the computer, so my sis, kristen and i began making the cake. Now, with this recipe, you needed to whip the egg whites to a froth, meaning lots and lost of stiring. Normaly this is done with an electric mixer, but the kitchen aid we were using for the batter was full of the rest of the mixed ingredients, so kristen began whipping them by hand with a whisk. It was taking a REALLY long time, and a lot of energy, so we all went and watched Family Guy (the Special People Olympics one). 21 minutes minutes later we were done, and we added them to the batter. It was then that we realised that we had forgotten the flour (first ingredient) so we added it in. We then poured the batter into two pand and put them in the oven to bake. Kristen nor I remembered how much the cake expands when it bakes, so after about 30 minutes in the oven, we went to check on it to see how much more time we needed. When i opened the oven, i found that the batter had completely spilled over the pan and was all over the bottom of the oven, burning. We quickly scraped up the smoking batter and threw it into the sink where it steamed after hitting the water. Meanwhile the cake is still spilling over, meaning  middle was not cooked, so we just let it spill and burn for 10 more minutes before taking them out and sticking them in the fridge to cool. While it was cooling, we noticed that we didnt have nearly enough frosting, so we needed to make some more. Every book we looked at involve this tarter crap which we didnt have, so we played it by ear, or mouth i guess, by melting chocolate, them tasting it while adding milk, vanilla, and sugar. Lots and lots of sugar. We were planing to use both kinds of frosting, but neither tasted anything like the other, so we decided to mix the two together. That doesnt sound very funny online, but at the time we were rolling on the floor laughing at the idea. I dont know why, but we were. So, after 2 more FG episodes, we pulled out the cakes, poured the frosting on, (yes, poured) and put the candles on. When my mom got home, we suprised her and sung and all that jazz, then she suggested we eat it, and Kristen and i were like, 'NO THANK YOU'! lol. After tasting everything for 2 hours, we had enough. So now, im full of cake and everything's happy. Ok, that is all. Oh and there a couple of pix below. Peace!!

      Today was boring as hell. I went to cut my grandparent grass, and made $20. Thats always pretty cool. By the way, if you dont know already, i have a new email adress.  urlLink DarkMatter08@hotmail.com . And if your too stupid to realize, especially if you were in the class of '04 NB with this in your computer login, the 08 in my email, sn, and blog url, stand for the year i graduate from high school. Im currently watching Jon Stewart, which shows that i do prefer the sofisticated lifestyle. Actualy, only someone as dumb as out president wouldnt get the jokes on it. After this im going to watch Jay Leno, with guest Dennis Miller. Funny guy Dennis Miller. Then i will watch Conan, who is also very funny, then ill watch about 3 Family Guy episodes, drink a milkshake, then go to bed. Ok, *yawn*. Enough of this crap!

      Yesterday, the day that Heather was soposed to come back and visit, was a very dissapointing day.  She never came, meaning no reward. By the way, if your wondering why Peter and I deserve our rewards, Pete summed it up vey nicely in a post on his blog ( urlLink http://peterspeaksenglish.blogspot.com ).  Nothing happened yesterday except that i want to a tile store to pick out bathroom tiles for the new house.  Not fun at all.  We're going to have a baige, sandy type floor tile, the white tiles up the walls about 1/2 way, then the top 1/2 of the wall we will paint some vibrant color.  It should look pretty cool.  Nothing is happening today except for a few errands and mowing lawns for $.  I've made $100 at least this past week.  No i will not buy you anything.  Now im going to go listen to Bad Beligion and throw darts at a picture of Bush! Peace!
