      omfg...the weirdest thing happend today. i was looking at this girl i liked last year and like all of a sudden she was just radiating beauty...it was so weird. seriosly like...the most beautiful thing id ever seen.  i know i sux at drawing...but it was so stricking i attempted to draw her.  and i actually did something new so i made some accomplishments in art.  but seriously...wow. i wish i woulda had my camera. it was that good.  im still in beauty shock.  then i was talking to her after school...i hope i dont relapse. anyway...yesterday i told my best friend something i, glad i did. and i made her a cd cuz i pee-ed her off i think. and she thought it was sweet...which is good...well thats about it

      okay so like 3rd dayof gym in a row and my teacher wasnt there...this...is my theory of why.  before she would be all "go wait for me outside" then the class like the good little students we are would all go outside.  shed come out..maybe 5 to 10 minutes later and yell at us cuz we didnt wait in the hall like she told us to. and ya if one or two people thought we were supposed to go outside thatd be fine...but the entire class heard her say we were.  so im thinking shes finnally flipped off the deep end and is locked up in an institution for schitzophrenia.  thats about it for today. oh ya when we were playing frisbee in gym i hit this short little fat kid who makes fun of us all...so that was nice. and my freind adam hit this girl racheal twice on accident...one in the head and another time in the leg (she jumped into it). me and adam were laughing soooooooooooooooooo hard haha. anyway...thats all

      awight         this morning i woke up in a...well...not caring at all mood. i literally laid in my bed for an hour just staring off into space.  so that was weird.  and i wanst in a good mood.  then i talked to emily and she made me happy (as usual).  then play practice.  it went well. i actaully want to see it now! AND AND...i got my invitation to try out for our comp play.  which is a big deal to me cuz it means doug is considering me the...crem de la crem.  hehe.  but now im having diffuculties finding a monologue.  i hate them.  i really do.  oh ya i almost forgot        yesterday me and emily went to the mall.  we had a very good time...least i did.  hehe.  apparently i bought a pair of pants that are a little tight and...ya. thanks for mentioning that em before 50 bucks was spent on them.  then i found this awesome shirt but my mom wouldnt let me get it "too flamboyant"...my dad liked it. haha.  so yes that was goodtimes         thats about it...go away till u come back again.

      let me recap if you will   Wednesday: I went to NY city and saw Urinetown, one of the funniest musicals ever maybe.  IT was soooooo fun. I hung out with my friend lindsay all day and we had a good time.  IT was one of those days u didnt want to end cuz the person u were with was makin ya so happy.  but unfortunetly, it did and this will have a follow up on friday  Thursday: nothing really exiting happend. cept bad crucible act 3 and good crucible act 4.  and im really behind in bio  Friday: so remember that girl i was talking about on wednesday? (if you dont, look up at wednesday and refresh urself). so i walk into school today and guesse what?!?!?! my good friend is like all over her and shes all over him and i wanted to KICK HIM IN THE FACE! and i know it should be guys before girls and thats what i kept telling myself to restrain myself from punching him in the face...i hope neither of them read this.  she wore a shirt that i picked out for her on wednesday (we went to a mall too you see) and she looked mad hot.  but (to quote dana) woe is me ( ;) ) and im just imagining everything i thought she felt for me.  oh well...it happens. thats it

      it seems as if i forgot to update it yesterday...       okay yesterday i dont think anything interesting happend. i ran two miles...but really slowly...           today was boring too.  i love history class though. it seems like im always happy in that class for one reason or another. i had KKKlayman today too.  oh boy was it fun. that was sarcastic.  me and pete wanted to yet again die.  i decided when i hone my force powers, i will choke and drive him insane.  pete still thinks its easier to kill himself in the class.  oh pete when will you learn.  when we left i went up to racheal and jenny and told them to just show klayman their boobs so he'll shut up for 2 seconds.  they said no...theyre not team players.  id do it if i could but u know...im a man and therefor cant.  ummm ya im procrastinating on my tons of hw so ima go do that...bye e

      yo      i decicded to update my blog cuz i was reading joe mauers and i thought i should update mine.  i didnt update witihn the last two days because a lot has been happening.  and i regret to inform you that i cannot tell you cuz its personal.  but just so u all know...if ur talking to me or something and im not paying attention or spacing out...its cuz of that...not cuz im bored.            oh yes.  today i attended nerd fest 04.  actaully theres alot of them...and actaully it was a REALMS event.  for all y'all who dont know...thats a LARP (live action role playing) thing.  it was a 6 course feast and it was hella tight.  plus i got to dress all kool and hung around with people like myself for 5 hours.  it was a good time.            okay i need to work on a comment thing on here.  but have u guys noticed that whenever u want to not thinking of something...everything seems to remind you of it? ya...oh well...

      sigh        this is the worst time of the year...u know why? because its so cold? no. because baseball season is over? no. because midterms? no. but because it is now time to start marketing for the worst day in the world...the name of the day depressed me just to hear it...yes...thats right...the dreaded valentines day.  i hate it. its the worst holiday ever.  i saw a bunch of ad's with the word "valentines" in it and i get pissed.  its just not a good day for the people (like me) who are alone, have always been alone, and will always be alone.  sure its great for the people who have someone...but if ur reading this blog..u know that i wont/dont/never will.  so therefor it is the most hated day ever where i curse the name of love and hate all of those who are so hopelessly in it.  it needs to die.  and i will be wearing all black the day before (because valentines day is a saturday this year).  so in summary...I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      yo      ugh. thats my feelings.  everyone else is doing an awesome job in comp, the cast and crew, the costumes look awesome and the set is too.  but then...theres me.  the kid who knows he sucks but still continues to act and make the shows he's in suck.  i have such an easy charecter but can i do it? no.  why cant i do it.  and of course its the last scene meaning it needs to be the best but im frikin ruining it.  i cant be obnoxious and snooty and pompous.  anyone would kill for such an easy role but can i do it? no of course not.  moving on from my crappy charecter...      my crappy accent.  ask anyone, whats an easy accent to do...you would say british...but can i do it? hell no!  i listen to the accent tape doug gave me but can i do it? of course not, because i was dealt the lucky hand of having a birth defect in my mouth and thanks to it i cant talk normally or do anything involving speech correctly.  thanks alot genetics.  seroiusly, the things i love to do most are singing and acting, and of course those require good diction an annunciation but can i do it? NO.  cant move my soft pallet, cant say my "r"'s.  cant do anything right involving speech...after 5 years of speech therapy u think i could but i cant.  cuz im a failure at the just like everything else i try.  i dont even know why i act anymore.  im the worst one on the stage for comp, but everyone else is too nice to say it.  im making everyone else worse. ugh...    well im done bitching

      hey all      today nothing really interesting happend...at all really.  nerbonne gave us this speach about how he was offended by the half time show and stuff cuz the music and the sexuality.  which  ican understand.  but im just a free spirit and raise my hand and say, "americans need to lighten up with the human body. in europe the human body is *gasp* thought as beautiful and not as shameful.  so to be offended by that is stupid.  second things are only offensive because we make them in our heads.  ur parents didnt want u to swear cuz it was wrong...you didnt know why and neither do they...but it is" he then contemplated what i said and agreed with me...THE DAY IS MINE!!!              im getting sick...which is just wonderful.  because i lllllllllllloooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvveeeeee being sick.  so much.  (sarcasm).  sometimes when i get a sore throat,i  start to literally freak out and start breathing really fast and sweating and all that stuff and just freaking out.  that happend today. i hate that.  its no fun.  then alyson gave me some tylenol and all was good. yay.  tis all for today i think....i have a feeling ill be back tonight for some reason...i dont know why...i just do...take it easy (see...im using it)

      okay         i just realized why i was so unhappy in 7th and 8th grade. most of the people i hung out with...made me feel like crap.  i just talked to one of them for an extended period of time...and all they can do is insult me and challenge me and make me feel wicked bad...and the worst part is...they were the ones i considered nice

      hey all                            oh comp...well the run has ended and what a great run it was.  i had soooooooooooo sooooooooooo sooooooooooo much fun at finals.  lets go by chronologically shall we?                             Thursday:  we didnt go right away meaning we had  to go to school...so that was no fun.  but then me and mike sat together on the bus and was bugging reb and joe and that was fun.  then i proceeded to call reb a man for the rest of the weekend...cuz she is >_>                              Friday: well got up at 5:30....w00t. we went around shopping and Joe got a shirt at Express Men...YAY JOE...it was kinda big but its still a start!  then we watched some more shows...and then TOM JONES performed...it was (in my opinion) the best show we've ever done.  i was very happyand proud after the show and everyone was pretty much wired.  then we watched some more shows and went home....me and amanda decided to sit together with joe and reb across from us talking about us...emily was supposed to spy but she failed...cuz she went to sleep                           Saturday: Last day of comp :(  it was very sad.  i loved that show so much cuz i worked so hard on it.  but all things must come to and end.  the group (as you all have figured out by now is me amanda reb joe and emily) went to flamers with amy...and i got a temp. tatoo of sir flamealot cuz i thought it was wicked funny.  then the awards ceremony...we only won 2 awards (congrats drew and kazim) and didnt go on (even though in my opinion....we should have) but thats okay.  so ya...good times

      im not really in an entry mood...but i am in a somewhat romantic mood.  so ima leave this song here that those of u who want to read can and think of someone u care for alot.  i know this song makes me think of her :)    Do you realize That you have the most beautiful face? Do you realize We're floating in space? Do you realize That happiness makes you cry?  Do you realize That everyone you know someday will die? And instead of saying all of your good-byes Let them know you realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun doesn't go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round   Do you realize That you have the most beautiful face?  Do you realize?   :)

      okay        now that most of the medicines and drugs them given me have officially worn off and im allowed to like...move by myself....ive decided to come and update you all on why exactly plastic surgery sucks ass....     1) you can have no expression on your face for like...at least 4 days.  i cant laugh right now, not cuz i dont want to, but because i physically cant.  meaning no smiling or anything and if u hear something really funny (damn you conan o'brian) your put in pain.       2) bathing is always a hastle.  because the bandages need to stay on and the doctors dont tell you if you can shower or not, you cant wash your hair for awhile.  and if your a hygene freak like me, thats a problem.        3) the drugs they give you.  anisthetics suck ass.  for the next two days your perpetually confused or dizzy or tired or have a head ache or all of them combined which it usually it.       4) sleeping.  no not actaully sleeping, but falling asleep and staying asleep.  i move alot when i sleep and of course my face has to as well.  meaning i keep getting woken up because something hits my nose.  bastards...     5)eating.  you cant eat anything you want.  and of course when u watch tv theres a nice juicy cheeseburger right there all the time so your reminded about how much u want it and how hungry you are but cant have it...more jello...     6) the need to bitch after that your all reading right now...'nuff said   there are more but i wont go on.  all im saying is that any person who decides to do this by there free will is stupid.  for me, it was cuz of birth defect, but people actaully wake up in the morning and say "i want to look better so ill get a surgery so i can suffer and hope it looks better when i come out" those vain bastards deserve what they get.  unless your really really really really ugly, and im talkin like...roseanne barr meets micheal jackson ugly...dont do it...someone will love you for your inside and you wont hafta not eat to change that.

      FLASH BACK! (once again)                   Approximately 2004 years ago (cuz i dont feel like doing the math) Jesus was back and doing his freaking people out thing.  the apostles were still locked up in their little room and were like crap crap crap...pilate was still like did i seriously just let a murderer go?, mary magdeline was getting a little...pent up ;), and Jesus was telling people to stick their fingers in the holes in his hands and side.  kindaweird but i dont think id mind being there right now                well ive had a lot on my mind lately so if i seem out of it thats why.  and its soo early in the day that nothing has yet happened...so blah i tell you...btw happy reserection day!...and if your jewish...happy...ummm...happy is that the guy we just killed day ;).

      FLASH BACK!   2004 years ago...Approximately...what was going on. Jesus was probably taken down from the cross right now, the two marys were probably crying and the apostles were like crap Jesus is gonna be pissed at us and they locked themself up in a room. the jews and romans were like go us, judas was dead and herod was still a flaming homosexual. pilate was like did i just let a murderer go and kill the messiah?...as we can see things now are probably better than now. so if you look at yourself on this saturday and be happy that your not living in jerusalem 2004 years ago approximately...even though its less cuz Jesus was 33 but i dont feel like doing the math. anyway.....    today was good...ive listen to Jesus Christ Superstar all day as u can probably tell from the comments i just made. so ya...un-eventful day

      ya, i havent updated in awhile...get over it                   as you can tell, im mad.  not at any of you, but at the people in charge of Hello Dolly.  ya see, were supposed to sell ads to raise money which is all well and good, but it seems rehersals get out at 5 when stores close...problem anyone? u may say theres friday but alas, some people still do things after school then and still cant.  and we'll still get in trouble if we dont sell any because of their poor planning.  and theyll say "we gave you days off"...days off a day in advance, no time to arrange rides.  "we gave you weekends" managers arnt in on weekends...duh! and some of us have lives.  not to mention a little something i like to call school.  but reemmeber...make money before bettering our chances of a bright future.  i really hope some one whos in charge reads this cuz its completely valid. seriously...and if we say something to them im sure theyll tell us to stop complaining and get over it, because were never right *rolls eyes*...theres so much more complaining i could be doing about this show but i wont cuz i want to be in future shows...enough of me bitching...             the other part of today was fine.  i saw amanda more than usual today which made me happy cuz i barely get to see her...what with her being a junior and all.  we watchen othello in class today and adam the director was like no your stupid u did it all wrong.  these people ;)...anyway thats enough for today...ttyl

      okay    so i was doing my daily blog check and i came upon this one that shall go un -named.  and i noticed that this person was playing right into the hand of another person.  and i hafta say, i love that. i really do.  especially when the one person is so blind to the fact.  sure its evil, but its funny.  i also think its funny when people miss the fact that they just got hit on.  thats funny too.  ...its also funny when joe is sitting all alone at the concert, and he looks like hes about to start laughing his ars off.  thats funny

       HAPPY ANNIVERSARY EMILY!!!                  hehe one month.  best month of my life.  hehe.        so new look for my blog.  ive communised it.  i agree with communism on every aspect but one and thats getting rid of differences.  i dont think they should do that...just not care about the dif.  yup thats my theory    so english long (lunch with emily yay!) and i felt like a loser.  these concepts in siddartha that like everyone was like thats so weird blah blah im like ya...i think about those things everyday and i kinda felt embarassed.  cuz im weird like that.  oh well.  i mean, dont  you guys  think about how our goals clutter our real goal and how we can really find happiness?  anyone...anyone? k.  well...good voice lesson today...yay!

      so today        woke up at....11:15. got up and worked for the next 5 hours.  at 5:30 emily came over cuz i figured it was too late to go to travis or shayla's b-day party. me and emily had fun.  we decided we look good in caucasian.  but we also decided there are things about ourselves we dont yet know haha.  so ya...day went by fast.      now i must come to the sad but nessacary matter at hand.  people who post "annonomously" (i know i spelled it wrong).  its really not funny. im taking mikes standpoint in this.  dont use some stupid name or a fake name or anything.  use your real name.  of course there are exeptions, like if what ur saying could get alot of people angry at you then its understandable. but not a random comment. it not kool.  its just annoying.  so if one more is left in my blog i will take comments off of it.  i ask all of you other bloggers out there to do the same if the next entry u post is reponded to by anonomys (once again spelled wrong) or anything like that.  now mine, czar adam is okay because it has my name...im just russian royalty.  so i ask my fellow bloggers to do the same as me, if a real name is not given, than take comments off.

      adding from adams blog...          im not saying WWII wasnt important.  it was.  but comparitivly to WWI it wasnt nearly as important.  why is the middle east pissed at us? WWI we promised then stuff we didnt give them.  and i have a grandfather who fought for this country and im not saying that it was stupid.  it wasnt.  it was just a reprocussion that had its own reprocussions.  i understand where bartmans comin from, and i understand where mikes comin from.  and your both right.  im not a side taker, id rather give the facts so u can make up your own mind so i dont have to.  i mean jerusalm vs. palestine is a result of WWII and thats very very important.  so i dunno...lets call it a draw guys?  day was fine.  emilys cute.  the end.

      hey           oh man last night was so fun.  lets go through it chronologically.  first we met at erins...nothing really happened.  then we went to a hospital to take pics where me and erin thought how terrible it was.  we were all happy and stuff...and there was someone in the hospital possibly being diagnosed with cancer...strange.  then we went to the dance.  it was pretty fun.  first we kinda did our rounds u know? and i started the slutty sophmore count.  that of course was the count of how many slutty sophmores were with juniors.  just cuz ur a sophmmore doesnt mean ur a slutty one, so kim, your safe.  by the end of the night i had 6.  haha oh our class.  so we ate dinner in which the cake sucked...and then they turned the lights off and started playing music.  they played get low.  and i was SHOCKED AND APPALLED that the dancers did not listen to the musicians instructions;no one got low, stoped and wiggled with it,  or touched their toes.  i was disgusted.  i loved the occasional RU BEING A GOOD BOY?!?!? from jessamyn *rolls eyes* then amanda and i got bored/hyper so we went to sit down and i renacted the last supper with salt and a tootsie roll.  i got salt in rudmans eyes.  my bad.  then we went to dance and when we were "jumping around" rudmans glasses broke.  oops.  then the dance finished and we all went to shaylas where me and rudman were ON CRACK! we were playing a card game that only i would screw up so i said i quit and me and rudman commentated the rest of the night.  erin dropped the meat and we felt it was a waste of meat. then hagar slapped me with ham.  we then went to play darts/pingpong.  everyone but john sucked at darts.  then we went home and almost hit a cat...got home at 2:30...thats all...

      i realized this today      as much as i think about things.  and as much as things confuse me, nothing makes me wonder more than the beauty of emily.  i dont understand how someone like me can get someone as great as her.  i can figure out religous/philisophical stuff...i can figure out pretty much everything.  but emily is one thing that i can not figure out, shes the question that will never be asnwerd and thats completely okay with me as long as shes with me :)

      hey          well today was another one of those days that makes me question my way of life.  notihng bad happened.  in fact my life is going exeedingly well.   but, i dont think im living the way i want to live.  its nothing i dont think i can change though.  i want to live in a place where there isnt any ignorance.  when if something bad happens we can see both sides of it and come to a resolution instead of assuming their bad were good.  maybe im setting too high of a goal for myself but i want to live my life like siddhartha lived his.  he was peaceful and knowledgable and just...warm.  he was truly happy.  not so say im not happy but theres more out there.  i want to be one with my enviroment.  and whats worse is that i have no one to talk to about this stuff.  i mean, i know you guys will listen and stuff...but i just think that our ideas of happiness are different.  im happy.  i love my life.  i love my family and i love emily and i love all the things im blessed with physically and materially.  but is that real happiness?  i wish there was a buddhist monk who i could talk to around here but theres just not.  i dont live in that world and i think im going to have to find my own real happiness.  because i have no desire to give up everything i have, i wouldnt be happy without it.  i dunno...im different than alot of americans, i know that.  maybe one day ill get to go to somewhere in asia where more people will understand. oh well...maybe hopefully ill find the answer.  one of the problems is though is that i dont even know if i know the question...:-/

      not that way!  so yes from the title of this blog i can assume u know what i will be writing about.  so if its just gonna make u say something and make fun of me...then *stop reading*.  i have, the most amazing girlfriend ever.  and i know that every guy probably thinks that about his gf, but i know this is true.  shes so beautiful and perfect in every way.  just being with her for 5 min makes my day the best ever.  her smile and eyes are breath-taking.  and thats just the beggining. shes has the best, most beautiful soul a person could ever have.  shes so caring and loving.  i love her so much   this is my journal and i can say what i want and i needed to get that out.  thanks for listening

      so today is friday...yay.  i spend friday night with emily and dana.  they are my friends.  we have fun...okay normal time haha.  so we went to friendlys and had a meal...but our waiter was a little confused and gave emily a chicken burger thing...and put gummy bears on the side of danas ice cream...oh well.  haha cream....  then we left and in the rain walked to the playground nearby...i think its at rice school. anyway the girls were afraid of rain and thunder so they hid under this thing and i kept swinging.  we then decided we were bored and went to subway.  on the way emily stepped on a dead chipmunk.  she flipped out and it was funny.  then we were stalked by a cop who kept driving by and slowing down liek we were doing something wrong by walking...i wanted to flip him off...really really bad, but i resisted...good night

      heres a question...   why cant anything ever go right for me? ever.  theres only one thing in my entire life that has and thats emily...everything was luck...but guesse what. if something has happend that was good, something bad came and completely erased that.  theres just no point to anything i do because it will all come back to fuck me over some how and im just fucking tired and sick of it.

      i havent updated in  a while...  this entry contains alot of bitching...im just forewarning you     im in one of those depressed moods again where i question my own existance. and everytime i do i get the same result.  im not happy with myself.  what i want to do above all else is help people, make a difference in their life and have them know that i care about them.  but have i? do i help any of you guys? not really.  everytime i "help" it just makes more problems....have i affected any of your lives?  if i died would any of you care? what would you say? i doubt ud say that i was a caring loving nurturing person like i want to be.  all you would say was that i was funny...but i want to help and i dont think i am. after highschool i want you guys to think of me as a person who if u were ever sad or down, you could come to me and talk and i could help you almost/every time.  but have i?  no.  maybe its cuz i care for everyone of you guys and want to help you and i feel like im not...i just want to help.  thats all...

      but i need other guys opinions   so i was reading my sisters  Glamour  (i was bored and there was notihng else to read) and there was this arcticle about why girls shouldnt get plastic surgery and stuff.&nbsp; and i agree.&nbsp; dont you guys (males leave comments).&nbsp; what girls dont realize is that guys like normal, natural girls.&nbsp; girls are the only ones that think they hafta be perfect.&nbsp; guys like girls who arnt fake and are themselves.&nbsp; arnt i right fellas?&nbsp; what makes women so beautifull is the fact that they arnt all blonde and big boobed.&nbsp; variety is the spice of life right?&nbsp; i for one think emily is the most beautiful, perfect girl&nbsp;in the world.&nbsp; and guesse what...shes not what hollywood said is beautiful.&nbsp; guys like normal girls.&nbsp; its the fact that they are normal that makes them so beautiful and perfect?&nbsp;   thats my opinion

      who is the anti-christ?  no, its not pete.  all you women love him, men hate him but they dont have a choice cuz their wives listen to anything he says.  thats right, Dr. Phil.  hes def. the anti-christ.  why? because people are supposed to love him, check.  comes out of nowhere, check.  is an influential person, check.  sure hes supposed to be from like eastern europe but still, thats like 3/4.  hes def. the anti-christ.  dont listen to anything he says! HE'LL KILL US ALL!

      you know, those stupid kind  so i was watching family guy today and they made this joke about how this guy with a hare lip was really disgusting and really weird.  and they used to call cleft lips harelips cuz it looks like a hare's lip. and in case u dont know, i have/had one.  and u know, i wasnt offended. i found it funny, cuz in all honesty, ya its hella nasty haha.  people need to learn to lighten up and joke about themselves.  i mean if u cant laugh about yourself and your imperfections than u need to look around at the world and find theres comedy in almost anything.  and if u can joke about urself, than u can joke about anything and things will be alot better.  like me with the deformity, or bartman with the jewish.  or pete with the gay.  guys like us can find the humour in it all.  and were better people for it.  so all you people out there who get offended by jokes about yourself...loosen up.  stereotypes are funny cuz its not really about the people, but the stereotype itself that u laugh at.  least thats how it is with me.  and most people.  so "dont make fun of me cuz im ________"...get over yourself...its not you, its the stereotype.
