      I really think doing university research is an amazingly isolating experience.&nbsp; Look at me, writing this blog, basically to myself -- with the vain hope of finding someone online who actually knows what I'm talking about.&nbsp;   You see, you're the expert.&nbsp; I actually have a visa that states I am a foreign expert if you need further proof.&nbsp; But apart from that, I  am  the expert -- in a really small isolated field of my own making.&nbsp; Is there anyone else, in the entire world, looking at community development, mass tourism and national parks in China.&nbsp; No. Otherwise my research would not be as exciting and new as it is.&nbsp; Yet, in saying that, who really cares what I'm researching except for me?&nbsp;   Writing a thesis serves to create a small little world of relevant theory and practice that I alone reside in fully and understand.&nbsp; Any future person reading my thesis is doing so for the purpose of finding a few things in it that contribute to  their &nbsp;small little world of research which may involve one of the same factors that mine involves.&nbsp; For fifty or sixty hours a week, I am lost in the 'thoughts of Kai Li' which reflect my own personal conjunction of education, experience, geography and history in a certain point of time.&nbsp; Not even my husband has a clue what I'm doing.&nbsp; I'm not even sure that my supervisor does.&nbsp; She's just waiting for the finished product.  And then the culture shock/depression on returning from the field.&nbsp; Nobody in New Zealand, in fact, no Westerner has ever lived as I lived in Panyazhai.&nbsp; No one knows my friends there.&nbsp; Most people don't even know of their existence.&nbsp; I think it's like when someone close to you dies that none of your friends know, there is no outlet for joint reflection and discussion -- they cease to exist without you remembering them.&nbsp; That's how I feel about my community of friends in Jiuzhaigou.&nbsp; I miss them, but who cares?&nbsp; I can't even contact them really.&nbsp; I am intensely interested in their fate, but who cares?&nbsp; I just become another eccentric academic who can't stop talking about their research.&nbsp; Do we present papers because we really think our research is meaningful and interesting to others? No, because we want to talk about ourselves, to justify our pitiful existence.&nbsp;   Incidently, I am going to present a seminar on my research.&nbsp; And two conference papers this year.&nbsp; So I'll finally have my 15 minutes (or hour) of fame.&nbsp; Some of my research experiences are also outlined on  urlLink www.mytripjournal.com/jiuzhaigoufieldwork  , which has all my emails and slices of lifes that I had the urge to splurt out while I was away (those that weren't mysteriously eaten up by random computers at dodgey internet cafes...)

      In regards to yesterday's post where I was struggling to understand why the community I'm researching saw health as a requirement for livelihoods even though it isn't actually now.  Lazyunistudent posted a comment regarding the interlinkages of livelihoods and well-being for the people I'm researching in Jiuzhaigou... and a whole lot of stuff I've looked at today confirms that opinion -- that they have simply been interlinked for so long that there is a time-lag with regards to this changing people's thinking.&nbsp; A seminar I went to today about public services in Africa confirmed this with some research regarding education.&nbsp; Even when education is provided by the state, it takes a sixty year period for it to be totally integrated into the culture.&nbsp; It requires firstly that parents be educated -- they will then almost automatically school their children.&nbsp; It requires that inequalties be signifcantly reduced between the quality of education available for rich and poor.&nbsp; It requires improved health, in that sick families will often keep (especially girl) children home to care for sick familiy members.&nbsp; AND it requires a diversified local economy, in that there has to be a reason for people to be educated -- if the only livelihood option available is farming, then there is no point wasting time and money being educated.  So for Jiuzhaigou, until recently, health (i.e. strength in their view) has been essential for the types of jobs available in their local economy -- farming, small businesses outdoors servicing tourists in all weather and so forth.&nbsp; Also they haven't had government handouts until 2001, so of course they have not got used to the idea that they don't have to earn a livelihood yet.  Secondly, I chatted to a development studies friend who pointed out that health is not the point of my thesis and I just needed to choose how I was approaching well-being, note the limitations and go forth with writing it up.&nbsp;   My supervisor later said the same thing, basically.&nbsp; That I had supported my decision to look at livelihoods fairly well, and to note that it was not strictly necessary according to present conditions for people to feel this way about well-being, but that according to their history and their distrust of the government it made sense.  So there we go.

      Ok.&nbsp; Thesis.&nbsp; Help. Please.  I'm writing about the community of Panya's conceptualisation of well-being, 'the good life',  xingfu,  development etc.&nbsp; Most of them said health was necessary to have a good life.&nbsp; I said why? They said because if you are healthy you can earn a living.  So -- if I want to track the change in wellbeing for the community, should I be tracking the change in  health  or in ability to earn a  livelihood ?  Because the strange thing is that now the government gives them a yearly payout from the national park gate takings, so even if they are unhealthy they still have a better livelihood than 90% of the county.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why would they value that so much if it's mostly unnecessary now?&nbsp; Either they value health intrinsically and just made up the livelihood thing because they thought I wanted something else; or they don't trust that the government provision will last; or they think the government provision is not enough.  It's too complicated for me to explain.&nbsp; I guess I should track health too, even if its just because that's what they told me and I should trust and believe their opinion, at least for values-based analysis.&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; I wonder if there is anyone who has researched Tibetan views on health before.&nbsp; That may give me a better understanding.  &nbsp;

      Well, I got married at age 20.&nbsp; I actually got engaged at 18 which shocked both my high school friends and my parents.&nbsp; And myself.&nbsp; I was kind of thinking we would wait until after we graduated, but since we were both quitting our orignal degrees and embarking on new study plans that was going to be a long time (considering I'm still at uni now at age 24).&nbsp; I remember hitching a ride home one night and two girls asking me why I was getting married.&nbsp; And I remember thinking -- if you've  met  him and  found  him already, why not snap him up?&nbsp; Why waste time you know, and wait until we're old?  I'm not sure I have the same view now, as there are complicating factors to that point of view.&nbsp; One is the 'marrying a total psycho without realising' factor.&nbsp; I've recently heard of a school friend who (apparently, according to others' analyses) married a "total psycho" (that's a quote) and was divorced within 5 months.&nbsp; Fortunately, that wasn't my case as we were engaged for 2 years (though my husband may admit privately he had no idea what kind of psycho he was getting himself in for with me).&nbsp; Secondly, I no longer subscribe to the Mr Right point of view (I love the fridge magnet that says "when I married Mr Right, I didn't know his first name was Always").&nbsp; Mostly because I do believe love is hard work, whether you were made for each other or not, and there's never going to be this perfect man (or woman) that you are perfectly suited to and in tune with.&nbsp; So possibly my thoughts on the matter where I thought I had found Mr Right and better marry him immediately are not so rational to me now, or even at the time of our marriage.&nbsp; Yet in saying that, not believing that I have to wait for a specific Mr Right means that I could marry without looking back and thinking "should it have been that person? could it have been this person?".&nbsp; I know that God will sort it all out, and bring me into His will.&nbsp;"Happily ever after" romantic marriage&nbsp;to Mr Right is  not &nbsp; the purpose of life!&nbsp; It is a factor in life, but any married person will tell you that life is more&nbsp;than marriage.  Other complicating factors include age -- I've heard people say "you'll never be ready anyway, so you might as well do it now", which I agree with to an extent.&nbsp; I don't think getting married any later would have been better for me.&nbsp; But I don't think getting married any earlier would have been clever either.&nbsp; I had the head knowledge that my husband could not fulfill all my needs as a person, and my identity was in God, but not the bitter disappointments of life that many older people have who  know &nbsp; through experience &nbsp;that they cannot rely totally on anyone for fulfillment.&nbsp; In saying that, if I had learnt that through a boyfriend experience it might&nbsp;cause&nbsp;me to place my hope in future fulfilling&nbsp;relationships, whereas to learn that within a safe marriage environment meant that I learnt it for this relationship -- to look to God and not to man.  I'm defensive about my state as a young married woman.&nbsp; I get sick of people assuming I'm domesticated and can bake.&nbsp; My husband and I are inidividuals, and we have learnt to let each other be individuals, and accept each other in this way.&nbsp; We have our own lives in a sense, as well as our joint lives.&nbsp; We have our own friends, and can let each other go in that sense.&nbsp; We are young university students, we are flatting, we do the dishes every&nbsp;3 or 4 days,&nbsp;we enjoy computer games and movies (rather than knitting and gardening) and going out with our friends -- individually or together.&nbsp; I'm so grateful to the friends that accept us as individuals, and as a couple too.&nbsp; I'm also grateful to my husband for teaching me this, in his own way, without realising it.&nbsp; So here's to young marrieds!

      So much for this blog dealing with my thesis -- anyone with half a brain still attached can see that my mind is constantly on other things!&nbsp; Well, it seems a common theme for procrastinating thesis writers.&nbsp; I have a great quote from one of those 'how to write a thesis' books:  "The most important feature of a sucessful thesis is that it should be finished." (Wilson, 1980:238)  Despite that being written in the year I was born, it's still true now!&nbsp; I must finish my thesis so I can go back and present it to the community, and also so I can go and visit Inner Mongolia on my way home.&nbsp; Surely that's inspiration enough?&nbsp;   I also have another stupid quote, the guy should be shot, or otherwise he's a 'real scholar' and I'm not:  "A scholar knows no boredom" Jean-Paul Richter 1763-1825  My thesis is fascinating, really.&nbsp; You'd love to read it.&nbsp; But  writing  it is total boredom.&nbsp; I've done the interesting stuff in the field, but now I have to put all that on paper, and try and sound clever in the process.

      “Development studies Masters student&nbsp;[Kai Li]&nbsp;is finding [NZ] pretty staid after dealing with beggars who cut off their feet and having goose intestines for lunch in China” was the opening line my cousin put forward for a local news item on my return from research in China.&nbsp; Sensationalism aside,&nbsp;[NZ] does seem pretty ‘staid’ in comparison with the crowd and colour of Western China.&nbsp; I did also have some quieter moments living in a small Tibetan village in Jiuzhaigou National Park, and had plenty of time for research despite threats of being deported by the police over visa troubles.&nbsp;   I might as well make a public confession now, that I spent just as much time working with the local villagers in their day jobs hiring out their colourful national dress to Chinese tourists as I did doing ‘real research’.&nbsp; However, this put me in good stead for later times of question-asking, and gave me something to do during those “what the hell am I doing here?” times that every honest researcher appears to go through!&nbsp; Basically, the job involved me (in my limited Mandarin Chinese) convincing tourists to rent out the clothing in any way possible – the most effective being trying to convince them that I was a local Tibetan who was born with unnaturally blonde hair and a rather big nose, and promising to take a photo with them if they rented their clothes from me.&nbsp; Of course, all the proceeds of this little adventure went back into the communal funds to be shared out among the villagers at the end of the day, so the locals were exceedingly happy to host me.   [Kai Li]&nbsp;has just returned from her fieldwork for her thesis “Examining the potential of mass tourism in the facilitation of community development: A case study of Jiu Zhai Gou National Park, Sichuan, China.”

      Isn't it strange catching up with old friends?&nbsp; It seems like they haven't changed, and that you have so much, but it's possible that it seems the same way with them.&nbsp; One of the reasons I haven't contacted many old friends is that I don't want to have to be the person they think I am, to live in the box I made for myself long ago.&nbsp; I have broken that mold, am a new person and so on, yet I feel pressure to be that person of old.&nbsp; I don't know whether I should have contacted my friend or not.&nbsp; I know I am not the person he thinks I am, and I want to prove otherwise -- but why does it matter?&nbsp; Why do I care?&nbsp; What are my motives anyway, besides curiosity?&nbsp;   I have a desire to be the changing force in people's lives, to lift them out of despair and monotony, but I myself am often despairing and my life is sometimes monotonous.&nbsp; Who am I to play the compassionate saviour with them?&nbsp;   I do care though, even though I haven't seen them for years, they have been in my thoughts and my heart.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I try to shut myself down and be totally unemotional with my 'old person' friends, I think I am different and somehow isolated from them.&nbsp; But we grew up together, and even though we have gone different ways, we still understand some fundamental things about each other.&nbsp; Why do some people stay in your heart for so long?&nbsp; Why can you forget some people with no regret, but not others?  Let's just hope I can be honest and true in this renewed friendship.&nbsp; That God will show me&nbsp;His purpose here,&nbsp;rather than me dictating mine.&nbsp; That I can accept changes in my friend.&nbsp; That I can communicate changes to him.&nbsp; I am no longer 17 and swayed by every wind.&nbsp; But neither am&nbsp;I ashamed of who I am and who I was, or&nbsp;of who I now&nbsp;follow.

      Sometimes I read people's blogs full of complaints and gripes about their workmates, family, government and the world in general.&nbsp; It makes me sad, and nothing makes me sadder than when Christians complain about other Christians in order to get onside with a non-Christian mate.&nbsp; I've done it so many times.&nbsp; It's kind of a pride thing -- trying to get across that yes, some Christians are strange/bad/boring/annoying but  I'm  not like that.&nbsp; But what does that do in the long run?&nbsp; Really, I am strange/bad/boring/annoying -- and sometimes the very thing that turns a non-Christian away from God is someone like me.&nbsp;  It started with the Crusades.&nbsp; Yes, we have to recognise that something went wrong.&nbsp; And any historian with half a brain can see that the Crusades were far more political than religious in the international scheme of things.&nbsp; So we say, yeah, the Crusades were bad, but  we're  not like that.&nbsp; It was the Catholic church.&nbsp; Or it was the Knights Templar.&nbsp; Or it was the rich people posing as Christians.&nbsp; Or it was because the Church and the State were combined so people became 'holy' people for the sake of power not Christ.&nbsp; Anyway -- the conclusion is, it wasn't us, it wasn't the real Christians.  So then we bring that into the modern times.&nbsp; When our mates say that religion turns them off because it starts wars, we say that those people aren't real Christians.&nbsp; When our mates complain about tele-evangelists where you can send them $20 to get your hanky blessed and receive healing, who are just in it for the money, we say that those people aren't real Christians.&nbsp; When our mates laugh at the&nbsp;women in long denim skirts and headscarfs who stand outside McDonalds while their husbands preach to the boy-racers, we say that those people aren't real Christians in the modern sense.&nbsp; When our mates see documentaries on TV for 'destiny' type churches we say, a little more hesitantly, that those people may not be real Christians.&nbsp; When our mates see American bible-belt Christians evangelising on campus with loud mid-west accents, we say that they aren't like NZ Christians, they may not even&nbsp;be real Christians.&nbsp; When another church in town has a healing meeting and people speak in tongues and are 'slain in the spirit' we say that the Christians in our church are more real in their relationship with God than those people -- there is a danger they may not be real Christians.  So when it comes down to it, we end up trying to bring people into our church, rather than  the  Church.&nbsp; But then comes the day when our church starts doing things we aren't used to or don't like, and we end up thinking we are the only real Christian.&nbsp; We try to 'make converts' to ourselves by convincing people how cool, how spiritual, how sensible we are in comparison to those other "christians".&nbsp;   We feel more comfortable when we are surrounded by people with the same beliefs as us.&nbsp; This is the way the world works.&nbsp; We try to work out little places where we can belong, where our comfort zones are kept neat and tidy, and we don't have to be challenged by difference.&nbsp; But Jesus didn't come to make everyone the same.&nbsp; That was what Mao came for.&nbsp; Jesus is full of  grace  and  truth .&nbsp; In grace there is acceptance of difference, and in truth, difference is displayed warts and all.&nbsp;

      I really should be writing up my fieldwork now.&nbsp; I’ve started with the boring stuff – transcriptions of interview notes into a legible and typed format, an outline of my research area with appropriately inserted references to official government documents.&nbsp; And then I even headed up a section ‘The community” and sat and looked at it flickering on my computer screen for two or three hours.&nbsp; The community!! What the hell am I doing with a little section heading numbered 4.2, with a budget of 500 words to discuss the concept of ‘community’ from the point of view of my ‘participants’.&nbsp; How can hours of laughter, discussions and friendship-building be coldly described as ‘observation’ and ‘interviews’?&nbsp;&nbsp;  What do you think of this?  4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Community&nbsp;  Oh web of complex and spectacular historical interactions!&nbsp; Are you the elusive Community that I seek?&nbsp; Who is that I research?&nbsp; Can a place name ever contain the spirit and soul of its inhabitants?&nbsp; Can a group of human interactions ever be confined to a place? If you displayed your contents to the literary world, would not my own name be also inscribed alongside them, who, in the academic world must have separate nomenclature in the holy trichotomy of Researcher, Particpants and Non-participants?&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm really not entitled to reverse culture shock.&nbsp; I mean, I was only in China for three months and the rest of my life has been happily lived out in New Zealand (most of it anyway).&nbsp; And it's not like I was even totally immersed in Chinese culture -- I moved around a bit and the only place I really spent any length of time in was a Tibetan area.&nbsp;   But I don't think the reverse culture shock was my reaction to NZ culture after time in Chinese culture.&nbsp; I think it was my reaction of a new self to my old life and my old self.&nbsp; What I mean is, China changed me somehow, and then when I returned home I couldn't just slip back into my old life comfortably.   One thing I notice about my life here is that it's so individual.&nbsp; I am the centre of my life, and everything revolves around me at varying distances.&nbsp; Except I'm not a sun, giving life, but a black hole -- sucking life.&nbsp; I am a student, doing my work.&nbsp; I have different groups of friends -- some development friends, some church friends, some Chinese friends, some random friends.&nbsp; They don't all know each other.&nbsp; I relate to each little satellite in my own way, but they do not collide.   In the village, you are not the centre of your life.&nbsp; I have yet to figure out what is -- possibly the family, or the community?&nbsp; But anyway, all your friends and relatives know each other -- you are a group and a community.&nbsp; It's really annoying and it's wonderful.&nbsp; So did I change?&nbsp; I don't think I stopped seeing myself as the centre of my life.&nbsp; But I got used to not having to make decisions on my own, I got used to my decisions in part being influenced by other's desires.&nbsp; The simplest decision in New Zealand just seems impossible.&nbsp; I really stopped caring what I ate or where I slept, and I just can't be bothered making those kind of decisions now.&nbsp; The nice thing about traditionalised cultures is that there is a set way to do everything.&nbsp; This is when you wash.&nbsp; This is what you eat for breakfast.&nbsp; This is what time you sleep.&nbsp; This is what time you snack.&nbsp; This is what clothes you wear.   It leaves time for the important things.&nbsp; Do you know in NZ I can sometimes spend 20 minutes deciding what to wear?&nbsp; And nobody cares anyway!&nbsp; I can spend half a day thinking about what to cook for dinner, every option which will give me nutrition, it just depends on what kind of taste I want.&nbsp; So many choices that are meaningless.&nbsp; It tires me out.&nbsp; I wonder if this kind of community environment is possible here?&nbsp; In the city, I don't even know the person who lives in the other half of our house.

      I'm still asking myself that question... I have heard that blogging is  not  an online diary, as some would have it - my diary would make no sense if I posted it online, and I wouldn't write half the things I write in there if there was any chance that anybody would be reading it.&nbsp; However, there are some things you write that aren't just for yourself.&nbsp; Writing is a good way to go over ideas, just like talking.&nbsp; Blogging has the advantage that you may find other people interested in your ideas and topics and actually get some feedback.&nbsp; So right from the beginning, I must confess I'm interested in comments.&nbsp; Today I'm not going to write anything interesting, but maybe tommorrow... The things I'm mostly thinking about now, which will undoubtedly be reflected in later postings: 'the day after tommorrow' (the film); culture shock (specifically me returning from China to NZ, and Chinese friends who return from holidays in China to study in NZ again); Chinese parenting; Tibetans in China; writing a thesis... I could go on.  Let's just leave it there for today, and I'll see how it goes tommorrow...

       Ok I'm going home now so I'm going to add to this tommorrow...      Christian Books  Oswald Chambers "My Utmost for His Highest" This is the only devotional I've ever found worth reading, absolutely brilliant insights that lead you into really considering your relationship with God in detail. Hannah Hurnard "Hinds' feet in High Places" An awesome allegory that brings you face to face with the Shepherd and your own narrow path of transformation. Rick Joyner "The Final Quest" and "The Call" This fully leads you into a vision of climbing closer to God, and the battles on the way.  If you're a picture person, some theoretical ideas you've thought you understood with your mind really imprint themselves on your heart. Fenelon's Letters -- Bishop Fenelon's letters to various people encouraging them in their walks.   Fictional Books  Oscar Wilde "The Picture of Dorian Gray" See my posts on this book Mary Shelley "Frankenstein" Classic story, you can really see some strange truthes about humanity in it. Jung Chang "Wild Swans" Three generations of women in China, awesome intro to history can't put it down Stephen Lawhead Songs of Albion trilogy -- this is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion.  The story is excellent fantasy, but with the King/Bard relationship fully reflecting the King/priest relationships in Kings etc, and the whole idea of a theocracy in some ways.  Amazing stuff. C.S. Lewis: "Out of the Silent Planet" and the other two in this trilogy: sci fi that's quite unrealistic but brilliantly thoughtful in terms of 'what ifs'.  Awesome analogies   Development Books  Armatya Sen "Development as Freedom" A whole different way of looking at development Naomi Klein "No Code" Globalisation thriller -- an analysis of the world. George Ritzer "the Mcdonaldisation of Society" title says it all.  [oh no um, yes I have read a hundred books over my course of studyin development and I would recommend... um um maybe tommorrow]

      Hi Dad, now you know what I really do at university.  But I know you've been wasting time on the internet when you should be working if you've been googling yourself!  Some of it's relevant to study, but quite a lot isn't... but those bits are more interesting.

      Walking in the rain today, I realised how nice it is to feel it on your face.  When I had an umbrella, I had to fight with the wind to stop it from turning inside and blowing away.  I huddled under its droopy broken spokes, and tried to walk quickly in the direction of the wind so I could stay dry.  I realised today that the rain you hear on your umbrella is greatly exaggerated and magnified.  It really sounds like its raining, but when you walk in the rain it's just a light pattering on your face.  You don't even really get wet.  I have a Tibetan friend who enjoys walking the rain -- a freak in China, where at the slightest drop, colourful cartoon umbrellas unfold like blooming flowers all over the street.  But I think he's right.  It's refreshing, it's good for us.  It's kind of an analogy to our attitude towards pain and suffering.  We try so hard to protect ourselves from it with our little puny broken ways, but when we finally stop fighting it, we realise it's good for us, it refreshes our relationship with God, it refreshes our comprehension of what is important.  Half the battle is in our fear of submitting to anything God throws at us.  Half the battle is won therefore, when we accept what has happened in our lives and let it mold and transform us -- not in a bitter twisted hiding behind a useless umbrella way; but in an honest, standing tall and trusting-in-God's-love-for-us way.

      Like Victor Frankenstein,  who, after months of hard work, no sleep and general insanity, created a being of intense power and ugliness, but only realised it himself when he placed the final touches and it opened its yellowed rheumy eyes and looked at him; he was revolted, scared by what he had created - and he fled to forget  I too, realised suddenly the huge monstrousity I had created, packed my bag and went home for a glass of wine and a movie.  But unlike Victor Frankenstein, when I returned to my office my monster is still there waiting for me, pleading me to make it good and pretty and wholesome like all the other kids.

      I finally "finished" my data chapter for my thesis.  It is a monster, a Frankenstein creation with a life of its own, sitting pretty at 17, 206 words (I was aiming for around 10,000).  So I took myself out for coffee, and sat down to go over it, aiming to try and cut out 5,000 words.   I gave up after an hour and a half.  It's terrible.  It's rubbish.  It's total codswollop.  Aiiya! Should I push 'new document' and begin again?  Can anything be redeemed from this wordy, ginormous, rather useless addition to the realm of human knowledge?  The funny thing is, when I look at my outline, with its terribly organised-looking numbering system, it really looks like I'm presenting a decent piece of research.  There must be something in that, at least.  It's just when I start explaining the intricacies of the development of the local community I somehow transform a fairly straightforward presentation of data into a discussion on the nature of humanity.   I think I need to take each individual section, and polish it as an essay of 2000 words; correcting myself as harshly as I do my students.  Hopefully if I can do this, the hugeness of the whole undertaking will be slightly diminished.   So I've come up with this:  Chapter 5 - Jiuzhaigou  5.1 - Site of research   Description of area  The people  The park   5.2 The Case Study Community  5.3 Community Understanding of Well-being   Terminology  Health  Education  Family  Other aspects  Summary   5.3 Changes in Wellbeing   Livelihood aspects  Choice and opportunities  Cultural and social aspects  Access to benefits   5.4 (don't have a heading for this yet -- Contributing factors??)   Characteristics of tourism in the area  Attitudes and skills of the local community  Contribution of local government policy   Now that sounds fairly reasonable doesn't it?  Let's just see if I can make it sound that logical as I discuss each point.

      My eyes! My Eyes! I'm currently trying to come up with ways to reduce my reliance on my eyes. That sounds quite strange, but the fact is, my eyesight has deteriorated quite a lot over the six years I've been at Uni, yet I've come to rely on them more and more for almost every activity of my life. When I was working at the bookshop, I could read without glasses most of the time because I only read for around an hour a day -- the rest of the day I was serving customers. However, let's take a look at my eye tally now:  My daily activities include writing my thesis, I am at uni for 8-10 hours per day, normally 5 days per week (sometimes 6). Around 6 of those hours are in front of a computer screen, including research, writing, surfing for news, emailing (i.e. work related). Around one hour is spent reading. Another hour studying Chinese. Possibly another hour paper shuffling, printing, organising, meeting supervisors etc. I also take some tutorials but that's hardly any time. Then some time mucking around eating lunch. And then some time online mucking around. That's around 7-9 hours per day of eye work. Aerobics a few days a week, which is a great eye rest and (this class anyway) workout. My extracurricular activities then include watching movies (eyes), reading classics (eyes, small print), reading rubbish (eyes), playing computer games (eyes), bible study (eyes)... hmmm, and aerobics (no eyes! well... comparatively), canoeing (no eyes, but I don't have a car now so I can't get my canoe anywhere), sewing (no eyes, but my sewing machine died), group bible study/prayer (no eyes!).  Nerd Alert!! I need some more no eyes life! I have big headaches from too much time in front of a screen. One option is to exchange my studying Chinese time for speaking Chinese -- call some friends and get out a bit! Actually friends are a great idea. And exercise is good. And I shouldn't eat my lunch in front of the computer.  Any other suggestions for my nerdy thesis-related life?  I don't study on Sundays, except for Chinese; but since watching movies and playing computer games are all eye related "I feel like I need something else".  I guess I also spend a lot of time doing housework in the weekend but that's really not cool.  Here's a great quote: Everything is for the eye these days - TV, Life, Look, the movies. Nothing is just for the mind. The next generation will have eyeballs as big as cantaloupes and no brain at all. -Fred Allen  ( urlLink http://wordsmith.org )

      Although I had seen most of this movie in Chinese, this weekend was the first time I saw it with English subtitles. I must say, its worth all its hype once you actually understand what's going on. I think my Chinese is definitely not good enough to have got the actual plot last time. Anyway, it really shows the pettiness of humankind -- how if we are put in a small box we lower ourselves to the standard of the box. Really, Songlian didn't even want to marry, and most likely neither did the other wives -- but when the limits are put around their world, and the road to their limited empowerment set, they concentrate all their energy on a petty war trying to attract their faceless husband for the sake of the power it gives them. It's interesting that these rules were set by generations of the family, and they have kept the women in line for ages. It really works to keep them subdued and compliant, as if Songlian had decided to live alone in her room, play her flute and not bother with all the schemes to attract the husband to her quarters; she would have been able to stay quite happily for an age. However, because the whole household skips to the beat of the woman who had her lanterns lit the night before, those who do not have this special treat are unable to eat what they like, have the special massage or even get the servants to do what they are supposed to do.  There's a great quote where Songlian states that this is a household of animals not humans, and that combined with the fact that you never see the husband's face brings you to see Zhang Yimou (director)'s point that they do not see each other as people worthy of relationships, but things to be used to get what you want. I think that's more common in these enlightened days than we realise too. How about programmes like Sex in the City or Friends, where the extras are merely sexual or comic objects, reduced to their value of entertainment or pleasure but not really seen as people -- except for the important main characters. And you can see this in student life too, where the reduction of people to objects -- notches in the bedpost, or the nerdy guy who gets to hang around with the cool people so they have someone to laugh at.

      Well, my site meter at least got over its momentary craziness. It's gone from over a million back down to 104, which seems much more reasonable.

      Ok, it was possible I had 10,000 hits total right?  I mean, it's unlikely, but possible.  But today the meter reads over 1 million.  Now that's ridiculous.  Some of the best blogs I read only register around 5,000 total, and they've been going for years.  I think this site meter is a scam.  You stick it on your site and it generates an exponential curve of vistor numbers to make you feel special.  I wish I could just go back to 73.  At least then I could see if I had 3 visitors a day or so, and felt like I was a little interesting.  But now that it was possibly all a scam, I feel totally rejected.

      My translator had asked me if I thought my research would be useful for the local people, and after a minute of stunned silence, I realised it wasn't at all. The only thing it was really good for was for the promotional and propaganda purposes of the Chinese government. That night Wusong gave me a gentle rebuke for not writing up my fieldnotes, and I said fairly casually "oh well, it's all meaningless anyway". He was a bit taken aback by that, mostly because he had come with me to live in China for three months, teaching a class of 80 bratty teenagers who weren't interested in English, coping with daily diarrhoea and trying to get about with very little Mandarin -- only to find that I found the whole thing meaningless anyway!  On discussion, he discovered that not only did I find my fieldwork meaningless, but the degree it contributed to was considered meaningless, and even the possible jobs leading on from the degree meaningless. I told him it was actually biblical because of Solomon's famous line "Meaningless, meaningless, all is meaningless. There is nothing new under the sun." He wasn't impressed, and asked me what was the point of coming over here, and making all the sacrifices for my degree? -- holding his breath for another "meaningless -- there was no point" answer.  But fortunately for our marriage, at that point I found some meaning! I told him that the relationships and the friendships with the local people here were deeply meaningful. The effect that they had had on my outlook, and the kinship that had built up between us over my time here, in my opinion, made the whole thing worthwhile.  I no longer had merely a vague, altruistic future aim of "helping people" -- but a sense of belonging in a community, a community to which I could contribute something of my own skills (along with all other members of the community). But my contribution to the community was not the defining characteristic of my relationship with them. The relationship comes first, and the contribution is just a small part of that.  I'm not sure if that makes sense or not, but in sum -- the conversation basically concluded that the relationships were the only meaningful thing (considering all the complications and ethical dilemmas and uncertainties of development work), and my thinking after talking to you brought me to the conclusion that 'development work' is just an aspect of the relationship.  I guess I come at it from a Christian perspective, in that relationship with God is the ultimate aim in life, seconded by relationships with 'my neighbour'. Jesus' two greatest commandments don't mention development -- but he does assume that 'loving your neighbour' may involve a bit of that -- but its not the purpose. If we cultivate relationships in order to do development that's merely an egotistical motivation -- helping our careers, or even just making us feel like we're a nice person, a good person (that's still for ourselves right?). But if relationships are our goal -- not our goal exactly, but our motivation -- and we do development as a consequence of that, it's possibly a longer-lasting and purer motive.

      Ok, I’ve found some stuff to write. And it’s true, really.  I’ve brought the discussion around to how the older people feel insecure about their future as their children are becoming Han Chinese, and they are not sure whether they will come home and care for their parents how they would like to be – they may have to move away into apartments and cities.  This is caused by a Chinese education, which is funded by tourism dollars that the Tibetan families have earned over the years.  So I didn’t have to make it up.

      I’m really just making it all up.  I don’t even know what I’m talking about now.  I’m supposed to have tracked the changes in family and community values (since it’s part of the community’s definition of well-being), but I never actually discussed this with them.  So this whole section will be based on my random impressions from living there.  Ai-yo!  Can I ever finish it?  What did I do there for three months?

      Those of you following the story of Dorian Gray, I'm not going to tell you the end... you'll have to read it yourself. I'm still interested if people know whether the book is a reflection of Oscar Wilde's life, or whether it's just an idea followed through to its logical conclusion. Any comments from artsy literature types who've studied this kind of thing? Anyone else whose read the book but come to different conclusions from me (see entries below)?  Well, just because I don't really have anything interesting (compared to Dorian Gray) to discuss today, I might as well let everyone know I'm not going back to China this year – the conference got cancelled. This has kind of taken away my motivation to finish my thesis quickly, which may be a problem as I am incredibly skilled in the fine art of procrastination (this may be a psychological feature of people who read and write blogs…). However, it does give me enough time to do a good job rather than rushing it through to the finish.  Word of advice to thesis writers/those considering masters degrees… just because you can write 500-1500 words per day, it doesn’t mean you are writing quality. Actually, even if you are a wonderfully skilled writer, it still doesn’t mean anything if it doesn’t directly relate to your thesis question. You need to be absolutely certain where you are going in terms of future conclusions, and ruthless in selecting only that information that is relevant to where you are going. People who keep presenting conference papers and writing journal articles on their research well after they have finished their masters do not do so because they have some sad beautiful mind inability to let it go, but because you pick up so much extra information and ideas in the field that you aren’t allowed to put in your thesis, and you want to analyse it and get it out somehow.  Actually, my data chapter has just passed 13,000 words. The total length of the thesis is supposed to be less than 40,000 and it consists of seven chapters. I have written three, and already have 30,000 words. Hmmmm. And it’s not even clear what my exact point is. This is a serious problem.  This is also a problem with qualitative research, where everything has to be described in words rather than tables and percentages. It’s about understanding ideas (both complex and contradictory) rather than presenting data exactly. They should allow a bigger word limit for qualitative research.

      Do you think there is something wrong with my counter?  When I went home on Friday I had a grand total of 84 hits.  When I looked at it this morning, I had 12,000.  And now it's 18,000.  And I appear on google if I search for my blog title, but not if I search for the contents in my blogs.  Do you think people would really be searching for something that had both 'thoughts' and 'kaili' as key words?  Seems odd.  Anyway, if you are all real people, welcome to this blog... please comment (but don't spam!) on anything, old or new.

      Well, I was right. He does kill him. He shows the painter what has happened to the portrait, and the painter freaks out, and though not a particularly moral man himself tries to convince Dorian Gray to pray a small prayer of repentence he learnt as a child. He quotes Isaiah 1 to him "although your sins are as scarlet, I will make them white as snow" and begs him to repent. Dorian is annoyed by this, and spotting a knife on the table, picks it up and murders him. He's kind of grossed out by it, so locks the door and leaves. He convinces an old close friend by blackmail to dispose of the body through his knowledge of chemistry.  So continued self-indulgence, Oscar Wilde theorises, leads to self-indulgence on a grand scale - disposing of a friend through annoyance. I wonder if that's true -- if we continually act out our desires and deny ourselves nothing, if we get to the stage where we don't even consider others -- we merely do what we desire. Dorian Gray is still concerned by the murder, but justifies himself because of the amount of pain the painter had unknowingly caused him. What would have seemed monstrous to him several years ago as a teenager, is now justifiable in his grander scheme of pleasing himself.  I also wonder if this is a lesson learnt from Wilde's own life, who (from my very vague knowledge) has had his struggles between different moralities. Or whether he just takes a point (what if there was no consequence to sin for one man) to its logical conclusion? More food for thought.

      Well, today I read a bit more of the book, and Dorian has continued along his path of self-indulgence.  These days, more and more people have a dislike for him but no one else is quite sure why – women who used to adore him quiver in fear and go white in shame when he enters a room.  Several young men, previously close friends of his, have committed suicide, gone insane, or had their gentlemanliness thrown into doubt by all.  But whoever speaks with Dorian Gray can’t help but note that his face is free from deceit or the stain of sin, and could not believe a bad word about him.   However, he himself is not truly free, as he can no longer leave town for fear of someone breaking into his room and seeing the painting.  He gets up suddenly and leaves parties to rush home and check on it.  Finally, he is just about to show the painting to the painter, who has come around to chastise him on account of the rumours circulating town about him and his friend’s married sister.  I wonder if he will really show it, and if the showing of the painting will set him free from the terrible shadow that it has over him – once someone knows what he truly is, will he be free from hiding? Will he reform?  Or will he just kill the painter afterwards…  Anyway, it got me thinking about a verse in 2 Corinthians, Chapter 4, about looking not at what is seen but what is unseen, for what is seen is only temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.  In the context, it is in the positive sense – that is, what is seen (the suffering we face in this world) is only for this life, but what is unseen (the transformation of our souls through that suffering) is eternal.  I think The Picture of Dorian Gray makes me wonder whether the reverse is true: what is seen is fake, but the corruption of the soul is unseen, and is eternal.  A young Vietnamese man asked me last night whether I thought sinning was like putting salt in a glass of water, even if you repented of it, you could never separate the salt out again – you had to live with the corruption.  Another young Taiwanese man said possibly if you put the water in the strong light (of the Truth) it would evaporate (ascend) and the salt would be left behind.  A glass of water doesn’t look any different with salt in it, but it can no longer refresh.  I don’t think the analogy can be taken too far though, it can’t express concepts such as grace or justice.  I wonder if we indulge in our religious and academic discussions much the same way as Dorian Gray indulges himself, or whether some good will come out

      If you've ever seen "League of extraordinary gentlemen" you would have wondered who Dorian Gray was, the guy who was immortal because he only grew old in his portrait, but not in real life.  Well, it's actually taken from a book by Oscar Wilde, of the title "The picture of Dorian Gray".  The beautiful Dorian Gray who is just coming of age is painted by his friend and the portrait given to him as a gift.  He is jealous of the portrait because of its imperishable beauty, where as his own true face will both age and show the effects of his sin.  He wishes that the portrait instead might capture his aging and the effects of his sin and that he might live on unblemished.  Miraculously, after he breaks up with his fiancee because she had a bad night on stage, his portrait has a cruel smirk instead of its normal innocent smile.  Dorian realises what has happened, and immediately decides to repent and write to his fiancee, using the painting as a conscience through which he can keep himself pure because of the knowledge that his very soul will show up for all to see.   Unfortunately, his fiancee had already committed suicide, and on receiving this knowledge, he decides that it is merely a romantic shakespearean end to a romance, and decides to see his painting as a gift -- he can sin and age and not have to experience the effects.  The interesting thing is the whole sin thing worked into the story.  I was expecting the aging thing, but not the sin.  The interesting thing about the sin is that as the book progresses and you see how Dorian tries out different sins, throwing himself into one at a time; the actual sins that Oscar Wilde chooses to portray (and I haven't finished the book yet) are mostly sins of indulgence (well, what is sin but selfishness...?).  The indulgences so far could be those of any well-educated lover of knowledge -- he collects musical instruments from all over the world, he collects silks and brocades, he attends operas, he collects rare jewels, he indulges an interest in different medicines, he becomes intrigued with Catholic masses and so forth (although there are some references to him waking up in inns in a dodgy part of town...).  But even these 'mild' sins show themselves on the canvas of his soul.  It's pure self-indulgence that Oscar Wilde seems to be studying.  I wonder how the book progresses, whether what begins as a richman's self-indulgence will transform him into a totally self-centred individual that leads to grosser and grosser sin?  And what will Oscar Wilde portray as gross sin? Or does self-indulgence in whatever form lead to self-destruction (or portrait destruction)?  Although it is possible that Wilde is doing a Plato, taking both sides of the argument in his book in order to work through a premise until its final conclusion.  Dorian Gray makes some eloquent arguments on all that humankind has lost through its bitter self-denial through the ages.  I wonder what Wilde's purpose is in writing the book, and which stage of his life it was written -- in young idealism, or in old regret?

      All my colleagues have come back from overseas fieldwork almost simultaneously. Interestingly, this year's batch of postgrads are all Pakeha (NZ Europeans) who have gone off for overseas research -- last year most of my class were people from developing countries who returned home for their research.  We started talking about how you just get into this "mode" when you are overseas, especially in a research situation. Nothing shocks you or surprises you, and you accept any trouble or that comes your way as almost expected. People ask me how I could go and live in a village in an isolated part of China, without knowing anyone or understanding their dialect of Tibetan. Without them understanding who you are, why you are there and even where you are from. But really, you just do it. You just stop thinking about that, and go ahead. You make your plans to travel, you have no arrangements of what will happen when you get there. When you get there you meet some people and you make some arrangements for where you will live. Then you just do it.   Most of the time you are totally out of whack culturally. Everything is strange -- the way people walk, the way people sit, the way people act in public, the way people stand in relation to you, the way people talk, the way people wash, the way people sleep -- everything is totally alien. After several days environmental factors lead you to understand some things -- you wash your hair outdoors in the sun in the afternoon because if you do it any other time its too cold. The floor is so dirty because people treat it like the ground -- traditional houses have dirt floors, you wear shoes, and you don't put anything on the ground even if you have concrete floors. You walk ridiculously slowly because of the altitude and you get too puffed. And so on...  But then there's some things you never understand. That you just have to accept, and they eventually become normal. You brush your teeth before breakfast. Because. You drink lukewarm boiled water -- not hot or not cold, because.  Eventually, you are not a total alien. You are accepted as a part of the community and as a stranger simultaneously. People accept your need to use toilet paper. Accept your need to drink cold water instead of tea. Accept your need for personal space although the concept is quite alien. And you get along. You even start to imagine you belong. And eventually, you do.  Then you go home.  Everything is the same. But you are different. And it starts all over again, but with a weird kind of dislocated sense you've done this all before.

      I'm currently reading the autobiography of Madame Guyon in which she talks about the martyrs of the first century after Christ as being Martyrs of the Son -- killed because of their belief that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead and their faith in Him. She reckons that the martyrs of the second century after Christ are Martyrs of the Holy Spirit -- those persecuted for following the leading of the Holy Spirit. She was definitely one of those -- her method of praying inwardly (rather than outloud shock horror) had the Catholic Church in an uproar during her time. But she held to her relationship with God even though it went against the accepted cultural/religious boundaries of the time. Other examples would be Molinos, Hudson Taylor, Martin Luther, Fenelon and others. It just got me thinking about how some people  just  follow the Word and some people place the Spirit as higher. But really, the Word and the Spirit are one, and there should be no dissension. Sometimes we use the Word as a premise in our own man-made logical arguments -- but these arguments are not the Word themselves. Sometimes we try to step ahead of the Spirit -- second guess where He is leading and try to establish it ourselves without submitting to His timing. I really need to learn to be obedient to the Word and the Spirit. I think I can only do this through giving up  everything  of myself -- the things I believe are good as well as the things I believe are bad. For example, I might think that I am really good at worship leading and that a certain pattern of worship leading always works. But if this pattern of worship leading is not where the Spirit wants to go, then its worthless -- i.e. unless the Lord builds the house, those who labour labour in vain. That's a fairly weak example -- it could go much deeper. My ideas of marriage are good and biblical (from the Word), but that doesn't mean they will necessary happen -- I must give up my desires and submit to what God has given me (through the Spirit). There are countless other things that I hold as being spiritual or biblical but are actually still of myself -- I really want to give up all to God, not just the things I don't like about me.

      Saw the movie  The Luzhin Defence  in the weekend, within 12 hours of seeing  The Missing  (Cate Blanchett, Tommy Lee Jones) -- it may have just been the comparison with the somewhat cliche latter, but I really thought  The Luzhin Defence  was quite good.  John Turturro and Emily Watson star, with Stuart Wilson (I think).  John Turturro is quite brilliant as the introverted Russian chess master Luzhin -- comparable to Russell Crowe's John Nash in  A Beautiful Mind .  Although you never find out much about Natalia's past, Emily Watson pulls off a convincing character -- you can almost understand her attraction to Luzhin!  The movie is based on the book by Vladimir Nabokov set in the 1920s, and directed by  Marleen Gorris.  The book is a masterful study of a young man who became hopelessly addicted to Chess (psychologists would say due to the mental association it had with his beloved aunt), and was exploited because of his talent.   The film is quite beautiful to watch.  It actually reminded me of watching  The Man who Cried  (Sally Potter) a somewhat incomprehensible but nonetheless moving movie starring Turturro with Johnny Depp and the adams family girl (forgot her name).  Not because of the story line, but just because it flowed well, had a  European symphony kind of  atmosphere  and was a pleasure to watch.  Turturro also stars in  O Brother Where Art Thou?  a hilarious take-off of Homer's  The Odyssey  where you need to have the subtitles turned on because the southern american accents are so strong!  I think Turturro might be my new star (besides Johnny Depp) to watch out for.
