      so how are you guys? im ok here trying to get over someone takes a while and is not fun. but dallas a little 10 year old is friends with justin's (the guy i like who im not trying to get over) little brother and he said hes gunna tell  justin that i like him but i dont care before i would have done something to try and change his mind but i dont care if he knows cause 1. i wont see him much so if he doesnt like me its not going to be all wired and 2. its better for them to know i never realized it but if you think about it if the person you like finds out and doesnt like you like that then you can not waste your time on them and still be friends at the same time you could be liken someone new and if they do you like back then you two can get together so its better and i have to say i dont like admitting that at all cause i dont always want people to know how i feel but anywho im just rambaling on ( i so spelt that wrong) so im going now love me

       i so love the song that i copyed on to my pg right under this. its such a great song and i wish i had a guy who felt like that about me that would be so cool. well anywho just thought id share this song with everyone cause its so good love me      And I'd give up forever to touch you   Cause I know that you feel me somehow   You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be   And I don't want to go home right now   And all I can taste is this moment   And all I can breathe is your life   Cause sooner or later it's over   I just don't want to miss you tonight   And I don't want the world to see me   Cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am   And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming   Or the moment of truth in your lies   When everything feels like the movies   Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive   And I don't want the world to see me   Cause I don't think that they'd understand   When everything's made to be broken   I just want you to know who I am

      All i ever wanted was to be a part of your heart, And for us to be together, never apart  No one else in the world can even compare, You're perfect and so is this love that we share.  We have so much more than I ever thought we would, I love you more than I ever thought I could.  I promise to give you all I have to give, I'll do anything for you as long as I live.  In your eyes I see our present, our future and past, By the way you look at me I know we will last.  I hope that one day you'll come to realize, How perfect you are when seen through my eyes.  - Ashley Borden -  Don't u just luv that poem?  I do...i dunno if i can relate to that YET but newayz...post ur comments on it if u want.  Have fun!

      Love easily breaks A heart once whole, Love easily takes A happy soul  And once it rips my heart apart Sewing of stitches gingerly start To heal a scarred and roughed up heart So tattered and torn by every thorn And finally when the day is done And when the moon has hid the sun I toss and turn within my bed The voices echo in my head  I see his face surrounding me "Stop haunting me!" I scream and pleed He shakes his and sneers at me "Not til you say the magic please!" I say a please; he laughs coldly "I'll never leave!" he taunts at me So then I punch his pretty face I look at his ruins with distaste I spit and say, "You were such a waste."  Then dawn breaks thru the silent dark A cheerful song brought by a lark I wake up very drowsily And make my bed so groggily The sun sheds light into my day A smile slowly plays across my face I sigh with relief and throw my arms out An angel holds me and with no doubts He takes me to a better place  where smiles are always on my face   >brokengurl13 >  I made that one up last nite and it took me from 9 - 11pm to come up w/this..but i think its pretty good.  well plz post ur comments!
