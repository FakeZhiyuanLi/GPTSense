      Happy Halloween!  Question for Blogger veterans; see down there, at the bottom of my blog? There's a set of links to the Webrings I'm on, and they will NOT all line up on one line. I can't figure out why... Any hints? Also I seem to be having a problem with my Archives.... Hmmm. To the support section! :cue batman music:  I like this blogger thing, I think.   Moving offices is going well; my new cube is about twice as big as my old one, so that's pretty cool. And if I stand up (half sized cube walls) I can see out the window and the Pacific Ocean. Yes, living in  southern California does have a few advantages. Though, with all this fire, not that many.  Yes I'm near the fire. Yes, I know people who have lost their homes, though, thank god, none that have lost their lives. It's been smoky and ashy and awful here for a while... But it seems to be a bit better now. Colder, wetter. The fires are 30-60% contained. Now what we need is a nice earthquake... :P  School is long. I'm working, and going to school, AND attempting  urlLink NaNoWriMo  again this year. You can follow my  urlLink NaNo Blog , if you're so inclined. (I know, nobody will. :D)  No knitting/fiber news, other than the fact that I like my short row ears. I want to include a progress bar in this blog, but it will have to wait for tomorrow...

      Good morning!  No pictures, yet, but I am trying to post more often.  Yey! Halloween is almost here! ::wriggles with joy:: I love Halloween!  So, I went to a urlLink  Silent Weekend  last weekend. ???, you ask? Silent weekend is a kind of immerse American Sign language camp. From Friday to Sunday, you do not talk. At all. Only signing. In your cabins, at meals, everything. It's fantastic. I always learn so much.  So anyway, I get up there, (having grabbed a few balls of wool and my knitting needles - never leave home without it, eh?) and realized I had no costume. I had exactly 1 day to come up with it, and I was 50 miles from a store, with no car, and couldn't talk.  What to do?  You guessed it. I whipped out the odd 'spice' colored yarn I had brought (kinda dull peach) to do a  urlLink Tangle  on Saturday night, and cast on ten stitches.  My goal? Somehow knit myself ears. Mouse ears....  So I knit along, increasing as I go, till I've got a bit of a crescent in my hand. I think to myself, 'gee, I wish I knew how to do short rows; this would be perfect for that! Oh well...'  Then I smack myself. Why not? I mean, I know the  theory  behind short rows. Even read the knitty.com article about wrapping stitches... why couldn't I?  So I tried it. And by gum, it worked! So I sat up Friday night, matching the one little cupped ear I had made, and then did a simple twisted cord (basically making a HUGE strand of yarn) for the tail. A black eyeliner penciled nose, and i was ready.   Ok, two more bits about this story. One: Everybody else had these great, elaborate costumes. One girl had made hers herself; a picture perfect Dorothy costume, complete with glittered shoes. Sewed the whole thing... And i was in grey pants, a grey shirt, and pink ears and tail...  The other thing is that there were these two Deaf kids there. I love kids. I love signing. I love signing to Deaf kids. See? So I had been teaching the girl to knit (she was fascinated by me knitting the ears), and playing with them both. I knit them little Kitty Nosewarmers. They used them for hats. I told them a story in ASL. We had fun....  Ok, so we're all standing up, waiting to be judged on the contest. I don't even want to be up there, as my 'costume' is pretty lame compared to the others... and out come the judges.  yup, the kids.  So they look us over, and I try to be 'rat-like' (in ASL, body language is very important) and the kids laugh at me. Good thing...  I won. I didn't mean to cheat! I didn't KNOW the kids would be the judges... Anyway, I won a free silent weekend... and all because I decided to try wrapped short rows!  Knitting: is there anything it can't do?  mouse

      Good morning!  Happy Thanksgiving, for those of you who partake. We had a nice time.  One of the highlights of the day was that Saint Cheryl taught me how to 'knit back', or knit without turning. What a cowinkidink, I was just reading about in some other blog about somebody catching on how to do that.  Well, actually, I learned how to purl back, because I was garter stitching (is that grammatically correct?), but whatever. Not easy at first, but even so, it was nicer than turning that long strap (for the backpack) and knitting across the back. And it was challenging, so it made me more interested in the boring strap knitting process.  And I can finally announce that the straps for the back pack are done! YEA! ::insert muppet dance here::  Now, I can't say the backpack is done, and here's why.  originally, I get the pattern and say 'Oooooo.... I wanna make that right away!'. But, of course, I couldn't just *make* the thing, that would be too easy... So I decide to make my own color pattern. Little tiny stripes instead of the big ones in the pattern. No problem.   Knit, knit, knit.  About 30 rows from the top of the bag, my roommate looses the pattern in one of her cleaning frenzies. I still haven't seen it. So now I get to wing it. No problem. I remember the pattern... Right?  Knit, knit, knit.  I finish the body of the bag! Woo! Now I have to do the straps.... At this point, I've decided to make a 3 color flap for the top, like a 'regular' backpack, rather than the kinda odd string things holding the one in the pattern closed. I figure out where to put the straps, I think, and begin to knit one. No problem?  Knit...  Knit....   knit....  Boy, this is boring....   knit....  and then I put it down. Knitting ten and turning was terrible; I wanted to stab my eyes out. So I sporadically worked on it for a month.  Last weekend I went to my friends, dutifully dragging the backpack. I'm so sick of doing the strap that after a month and a half, I only have like five inches of the *first* strap. My friends laugh at me, and this motivates me to finish that first strap.  I cast on the second immediately, afraid that my enthusiasm will fade.  Thursday, while things are cooking, we sat on the couch and watched DVDs (Man with Two Brains, Gammera the invincible, and the Two Towers). Saint Cheryl looks over and says, "that'd go quicker if you knit back, you know." and proceeds to show me how.  Hallalula!  I finished it in less than an hour.   I have undecided to do a colorwork flap... but  urlLink Wendy  has made me want to do pockets, so I will. Anybody got any ideas for motifs? The whole bag is gray with red and blue stripes...  Stay tuned....

      I have seen the face of yarn god, and it is Velona Needleworks.  Ok, maybe not, but it's the best I've ever seen, down here in Southern Ca, where yarns stores seem to be few and far between.   urlLink Velona Needleworks ... my god, it's a saphic orgy of yarn.  My friend took me there because it was her birthday, and I told her she could go to any store and spend 40$. Of course she picked a yarn store!  So I walk in, and stop dead. The store is huge (compaired to the 'yarn closets' i'm used to), and packed to the ceiling with yarn. Every type of yarn i've ever heard of was there, in bags and shelves and boxed. From Lambs pride to trendstter, lace weight to super bulky. Cheap acrilic was there, shoved into a nook at the back. Eyelash, glitter, fur, railroad, flashing before my bedazzled eyes. Casmear and angora items beged to be touched. Every surface, vertical, horizontal, or diaganal, covered with kits and bags and patterns and yarn.  Oh so much yarn.  yarngasm, from both of us.  So we poke around for a little while, and next thing we know, one of the boy pops in and says we've been gone for an hour, the babies are crying, are we almost done?  An hour? It felt like moments... The alien abduction of fiber people can be done with yarn.  We touch, and talk, and ooo, and ahhh at everything. She can't decide what she wants, and i'm picking up things, putting them in my basket, and then returning them for something else I can't leave behind. We're drownding in choices... and loving it.  Eventualy we find ourselves at the counter, and she puts her little stack of yarn up there, and I find myself with only one (1) skein and 2 sets of needles. How the hell did I do that? the store isn't the cheapest, so we tried to get the most from our money.  Anyway, here's what I got. One skein of Trendsetter CIAO, a neeto ribbon-type yarn that looks like a little tiny knitted tube. I got it in the Brown/black Leopard colorway, and it's the softest thing I've ever felt. It's wonderful!  More later. I wanted to share my yarn love with yall.

      Hello again!  Boy, November is hella busy for me! I feel better than last time, and no, you don't want to know.  Lets see... Haven't knitted a stitch. Not one. Haven't even picked up my needles in days and days, though I look at my yarn and drool now and again.  I did pick up " urlLink Folk bags " at  urlLink Borders . Looks faboo. With all the bag knitting going on, (I blame  urlLink Rob  and  urlLink Wendy ), this book couldn't have come at a better time!  Here's some of the bags I've found patterns for (* means free pattern!):  * urlLink Suki , from  urlLink Knitty  Booga, (link to  urlLink Wendy ), mistress of Booga bags) Lots of bags from  urlLink Two Old bags , pictured in  urlLink Rob's blog  , my favorite so far;  urlLink the felted daypack  And all the other bags on  urlLink Rob's  blog are great too.  anybody else have any neat bag patterns? Maybe I'll take after Wendy and put up a bag pattern page...  :)

      sick. Miserable.  Not knitting. Not doing anything but working and moving and school and being sick.  Oh, and Nanowrimo. I'm up to 6608 words.  Went to the Southern California Handweavers sale. Was good; only bought 6 pounds of yarn and a set of headles. Oh, and a booklet called "Spin, span, spun" about spinning folklore.  Gonna go now. miserable. Completly, utterly, miserable.

      oh. My. God.  Never, ever, ever meant to go this long. Sheesh. So much for 'blogging more often.'  Anyhoo... Hope everybody had a good (Insert holiday of choice here)! It was lovely here. I went to Vegas and stayed in  urlLink the Orleans  hotel. Lots and lots of fun.  Knitting stuff:   I finished the backpack, way back at the end of the month. Here are the long withheld pictures of it in its unfelted glory.   I just realized I have the wrong disk. Well, here are some of the pictures... Not quite done, but, oh well.     That's with the straps half done, and unfelted obviously.  Here's a picture of my Fuzzy Feet...     Began those long, long ago.  And finally, to close, a picture of the Big Hat, (Link to an  urlLink old archive page  where I talk about the Big Hat and the fuzzy feet) modeled (unknowingly) by the boy, less than half awake.    :)

      Hello Happy Bloggers!!  No, not sure why I'm excited today. Ok, that's a lie. I've been going to  urlLink Curves  and have lost 4 lbs in 2 weeks. At this rate I'll be my ideal weight  by Christmas of next year. Unbelievable. And no, I'm not on the super-scary Akins diet or anything. I just cut my portions in half. Now that my stomach has shrunken, it's not so hard. I just stop eating when I'm full.  I know, I know, that's what everybody says, but it's true. Not so hard, really.  Look what I bought!      It's the Boyd NeedleMaster set. I've wanted one for ever so long. Biddy, who didn't like it because the tension of her knitting makes the tips unscrew, sold it to me. I don't knit that tightly.  I also bought 2 skeins of some silky, slippy yarn. Trendsetter Volia print, in color #21, Ocean Water, and another in gray. I'm knitting a scarf (how original,) alternating the dark purple blue of the Ocean water with the soft gray. It will be nice, I think.     I have decided, for sure, to buy a wheel with my tax return, which I should get any day now. So... Which do I get? I'm leaning toward the Ashford Traditional, because I can use it at the  urlLink *Renaissance Faire*,  and because I know 2 women who have them, and are happy. Any thoughts, oh great blogging masses? (assuming, of course, that anybody reads this thing anymore...)  Oh interesting thing.  Last night I had a dream about  urlLink Wendy . No, not that kind of dream, you sicko! This one was... odd. I dreamed she wrote a blog entry, and this is what it said:   "So, it's true. I have been accepting gifts from the International Broccoli Counsel. So far, they've given me a neat box and this shawl.  (Picture of Wendy holding the shawl and Lucy)  Now, whether this will change my mind about the Issue, I'm not sure, but I can say that those guys at the IBC are swell."   ....  Ok, I have no idea where that came from.  urlLink Wendy , do you take bribes from the IBC?

      Good things are afoot.  I got a camera, so I'll be able to post pictures soon. Yey. I started (and finished) a hat, of which you will hear the Saga of the Hat in my next post.  But the most exciting thing, for me, is that i'm going to buy a spinning wheel with my tax return. Now I just have to figure out which one...  Short post. I'll update when I get my pictures off the camera.

      Alright. I'm participating in the  urlLink ThreadyBear knit along , and  urlLink Matt  has come up with so many different colors for us to try!  Here's the colors I'm debating: (in order ) Hedgerow, Jeans, Spice, and Tumbleweed             I like how these colors bring some of the pattern forward, and some of it back. Dimensional! Which should I do?  On other news: I've made some health decisions, and joined  urlLink Curves . My goal is to drop from a 24 (you didn't know I was a fat mouse, did you?) to a 14. Which, technically, is still 'overweight' for this society, but fuck um. And, while I am changing my eating habits, I don't mind the weight, as long as I'm healthier. I'm geneticaly disposed to getting diabeties, so i have to be careful... I have to be able to keep up with the boy when he's dancing, you know.... Wish me luck.

      Happy New Year!  :)  I gave in. Rob at  urlLink BlackDog  kept talking about this luscious yarn.... 70 % alpaca, 30% angora... yeah, I have Indulged. 2 skeins natural, one purple fire. I might dye the natural. Oooo, handpainted Indulgence... that sounds nice. I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do with it... something either for the face, or something that will get a lot of touching, like the belly of a teddy bear. Mmmm, maybe make a 'nu nu' bunny, named for the noise my friends child made when she stroked a certain stuffed friend.  On other news...  urlLink ThreadBear   rocks . I emailed them, and within ten minutes, my yarn was packed and ready to go. Bless you,  urlLink Matt  and  urlLink Rob ; enablers of our yarn habits, pushers of inspiration, purveyor of yarn lust. You are the madams of the bordello of knitting joy.  The other thing I'm currently obsessing over (mouse, obsessing? No...) is shadow knitting.   Don't roll your eyes at me. I know that most of the patterns are insipid, and that most of the people doing it are that strange and unknowable quantity the 'machine knitter', who will 'save time' and let the machine knit... and then hand convert the purl stitches... But the technique itself is so interesting, and my feral little brain has been chewing on it.  Vivian Hoxbro has a  urlLink book  coming out soon, and that might help, but my brain is churning with thoughts of dark garments in small pinstripe, patterned with messages and things glimpsed out of the corner of your eye... and intarsia type scenes with surprise elements...  I know, I'm nuts. Let me run for a while with this, and it will either pan out or I will curse myself and get back on the well worn path of the knitting traditionalist.  I never could leave well enough alone.  I finished a  urlLink Coronet  hat for Biddy (hi biddy) and started one for myself. I love cabling. Maybe if I finish the  urlLink Thready Bear sweater  I'll be confident enough to make a real one, and maybe it will have cables... Now, if I could just read damn cable charts....

      Well, if you've notices changes.. you're right. Stupid blogger ate my blog, and my template, and all my posts except for the first two. So I have no archives, no previous posts...   Not that I've been updating lately. My sitemeter confirms that no one is reading this blog but me. But that's ok.   Means I can cus.   FUCK! ASS! (in honor of Boondock Saints, a faboo movie)   I have been knitting, however:   I knit a stripy baby hat on Saturday, just a simple rolled brim thing, but the little boy I handed it to liked it. At some point I will make me a long stripy stocking-cap type thing, with a point that trails down my back. Maybe with a little pom pom ... I know that it's pom pon, but I agree with the lady from Stitch 'n Bitch that it makes it sound like a feminine product.    Also from Stitch n' Bitch, I'm making the Punk Rock Backpack, with a monkey on it. ... Yes, this means I'm going to try Intarsia, but... Monkey! How could I resist? I'm doing it in blue, with a brown and cream monkey. My mate thinks I should write "I fling Poo" under it, but... Maybe not. Don't want to encourage the poo-flinging monkeys, do we?   On other crafting news, I have many many ideas for my ceramics class. I may actualy try to throw on the wheel today; i've been avoiding it because i've been too depressed to get filthy. I know, how sad is that?   You can never be to depressed to get dirty!   And i'm a dirty girl.

        You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Hee hee. Take that, Red!  Hey there. Doing some neat stuff. Finally finished the pair of  urlLink Fuzzy Feet  for my little sister. I started the damn things back in November, meant to give them to her at Christmas... then it was pushed to her February birthday... and beyond. But I finished them. I did. Yey me.  Ok, they don't match because the second I did at a  urlLink Silent Weekend  and forgot the pattern. But she won't notice. Hell, she might not even ever wear them. But I feel good.  Hmmm, what else is going on? Oh, I'm doing a speech about felting in my speech class, and so have been felting balls for a few weeks. No, I'm not being dirty... After doing the first by hand, I decided to take the automated rout; handfuls of half felted wool plucked right out of the brown soak water, shoved into pantyhose and tied shut. I had a washer full of the weirdest looking wool sausages... Anyway, I'll have pictures when I'm done... I hope. I also dyed a bunch of old roving I had, so that people can customize their balls.   And we all know how much people like to have customizable balls.  On the dyeing front, I have an exciting opportunity.  This is a Sea Hare:    If agitated, they will produce 'ink'.    In my Marine Biology class, somebody brought in a Sea Hare... So, of course, when they offered to tickle it to show us the ink, I ran for a cup and, when they pulled the squirming gastropod from the water, I collected the violently purple liquid spewing from it. I have, in my fridge, two test tubes of Sea Hare Terror, bottled and labeled.  I'm going to try to dye some fiber with it. Now, I don't know what mordant I need, or if it will take, or if trying it is going to make my head explode. But I do know that with documentation, this undertaking, even if I fail, will count for  two  required papers; one for marine biology, and the other for my reenactment group. How do you think they got 'royal purple'? That's right, they did things like tickling big slugs and  urlLink pissing on lichien  and then dyed their clothing with it.  Ha.  Wish me luck; one source I found said it won't work. Maybe I'll just pee on it...

      About half moved into the new place. The Mate did something very, very nice; he gave me a whole wall for my crafting stuff. Now i've got an eight foot table, a set of wire cubes (like the  urlLink ThreadBear  yarn cubes) for my yarn, and a bookcase for my growing craft books section. Life is good.  Not much other crafting news.  urlLink Kitten  (formaly Biddy on this blog) is going to teach me to follow a sewing pattern. I know how to sew, basicaly; my grandmother let me learn when I was little, and I can knock out a pillow or a stuffed animal... as long as I am designing it. Patterns scare me. Kitten promises that learning patterns won't hurt... much.  No picture of the purple fruit hat; the mother-to-be showed up at faire this weekend, and I gave the hat to her. But here is a sketch:         My take on the fruit hat.    Knitting on the sophie bag is going well; i'm about 14 rows into the body of the bag. Granted, I knitted some of it while at Musicalie at Ren Faire, so the decreases are a bit... off. Just a few stitches. Not too bad, and i'm not going to rip back. Not for 2 stiches on a felted bag. Not worth it.  Well, that's it for now. Hopefully i'll have pictures of my new craft area soon.  Have a good Memorial Day weekend if you get it off, mouse

      Finished the fruit hat, with it's ginormus leaf. I mean it, the leaf is huge. Will come to the kids ear, I think, once she is born and wears it. Wearing it now would be... sticky.  Yey for me! I followed a pattern, with only one little mistake! That leaf is cute; it has a little ridge of slip stitches running up the center, and the shaping is simple and nice. I know, I know, big deal, but I've never really followed small, complex patterns before. I'm more of a 'yeah, yeah, I get it, make it get smaller at the top' kind of knitter. Does this mean I design my own stuff? Kinda; I incorporate a pattern into my brain, and my brain disects peices of it, which show up other places. Why? I dunno, just how my brain works, I guess.  But I did that leaf... maybe I can do lace or something...  Now, I know that Caroline reads the blog (Hi Caroline!) but i'm just not sure anybody else does. Anyone wanna drop me a note to say 'I read it' so I don't feel so lonely?   /cue sad music and big eyes.  Speaking of big eyes; go see  urlLink Shrek 2 , if just for Puss in Boots. He's so...  catlike  it's scary. We were squeeing the whole time because of the catlikeness of this cat. hairballs, licking himself, and an ego the size of the entire world. And evil. Very evil. Like... purring to make you pick him up and then clawing your eyes out. And subtle things... like staring at himself adoringly in a passing window. If cats could talk... they would  be  Puss.     when I find a picture of the Big Eyes i'll put it up. Seriously, this is a smart, funny movie. The kids won't get all the jokes... but you will. There's movie homages to many things; Lord of the Rings, Ghostbusters (Squee!) and just about every other great movie in history. So, so funny.

      Ahhh, summer vacation. So, I'm done with school for the semester, and I am very,  very  happy. I didn't think I'd make it. 13.5 units... plus a full time job,  plus  another 'job' that took me out of town every weekend. I'm not sure how I made it, but I did.  And I think I might have pulled a 4.0. 0_0  So, that's good. I got a bit of knitting done while waiting for Biddy to get her newest tattoo, done by the incomparable  urlLink Pat Fish . Go check her out. She's witty, sharp, a wonderful artist, and has two beautiful Irish Wolfhounds.  For those of you who've never seen one:      So there. That's what they look like. No, the dog, not the boy. Man, you lot are picky!  So, I'm sittin' there, watching Biddy get a lovely still life painted into her arm, and I'm knitting away with some scrap  urlLink Paton's Canadiana  in an eggplant color. My goal? A quick version of the ever popular fruit hat. I was  going  to do a grape. Then both my brain and Biddy point out that grapes come in bunches. Now, this gift is for a very fertile friend of mine, but I certainly don't want her to have an entire bunch of babies! So I change my plans for the stem and leaf, and now it's a plum hat.  Right...  I finished it up the other night, and managed not to kill myself with the DPNs. Go me! Don't mock me.  I'm  the girl who manages to cut herself on butter knives and phone booths. I actually cut myself on a lollipop once. No kidding. For a while my mate wouldn't let me cut my own food for fear of hurting myself. Anyway... I added a stem, and pulled out the eye gouging green scrap yarn I have for the leaf.  I think, "I can make a leaf..." and then I proceed to knit what looks like a run over frog, or perhaps the lost paddle to a very relaxed canoe. No, no, this won't work!  So I comb the internet and come up with a leaf pattern I  think  I can do. I'd share it... but I forgot to bookmark the site, so all I have is the pattern. And we all know not to ask for somebody else's pattern, don't we? See  urlLink Wendy (May 07 post) if you're unclear on this.  More on that as it develops.  I also was struck by the thought that I should start another project. Why? Who cares.  I saw the  urlLink Sophie  bag mentioned  urlLink Rob's blog , and I just had to start it. So I dig up some worsted type yarn (Don't worry, I waited 30 minutes after eating inspiration to go Stash Diving. Don't want to get a brain cramp, after all,) and came up with some GOD awful yellow yarn I bought at the Torrance Handspinner's sale in August. Now, you have to understand, this yarn came in a HUGE hank. Like... bigger than a newborn baby. Ok, a small newborn. But big, I tell you. And it's scratchy. And it was cheap; 5$ for the whole thing. So I bought it. And 4 others of different colors. The dye is spotty, the yarn is scratchy, and it felts.  I'm in love. :D  So I pull two chairs a few feet apart and begin to wind it into a ball. By hand, since I seem to have misplaced my craftMum's ball winder. Whoops... Anyway, I wind. And wind. And  wind . Mate reads to me from Hunter S. Thompson's  urlLink The Great Shark Hunt    to keep my brain busy. I love that man. You pick whether I mean my mate or Hunter S.  At some point I realize that I'm turning the ball once for every 3 pulls off the skein. I look down, and great googile mooglie! The ball is bigger than my head!  So I stop. I make a second, normal sized ball with what's left of the skein and put Godzilla ball away. I kit back and forth on the needles I have on hand (Gauge? We don't need no stinking gauge... I know, I know, bad knitter... but it's not like it's a garment, after all.) which was a size 8 or so. Give or take; these are Honey's old needles, given to me when her eyesight faded. No numbers to be found.  Knit, knit, knit.  I love bag patterns. Back and fourth, then pick up the edges and away you go! So... on Mother's day, away I went... only to realize that the circular I grabbed in my dash out the door was a size 4.   Yes, going from size 8 to size 4... I knew it wasn't gonna work , but I started it anyway, just to see.  Hoo Boy! Not pretty. Looked like a pear with a glandular condition. So last night I ripped out the size 4 disaster (And we all know that most  women aren't size 4, and the media is teaching us to be that size. DOWN WITH SKINNY MODELS! ::cough:: um...) and dug out my NeedleMaster kit and set to work. I'm a inch or so up the sides.  Maybe it's time for me to read the pattern, eh?  I should shut up; this post is huge. Have a good weekend, and if you're around the LA area, come see me at the  urlLink Renaissance Faire ; I'm the 'dim' Scottish woman playing with yarn in the street.

      Hey there!  So, I've been evicted. That sucks. I have finals. That sucks. I had to basicaly quit the Ren faire, though I might end up going back if I can get somebody else to spend 2.45$ on gas for me.   So what did I do? Start another project, of course!  It's basicaly a  urlLink Sophie  bag, from  urlLink MagKnits , but I used some scratchy but feltable yarn from my stash (rug yarn? I dunno what it is. I have a approx 3 lb ball of the stuff... ball's larger than my head.) and whatever needles I have on hand. Yes, gauge is off. No, not enough that it should be a big problem. I'm only kinda following the pattern anyway; the handles are what really make this bag, and I'll be doing that... eventualy.  Currently using my dad's high speed internet. It's a sad, sad day when your parents have a better internet connection than you do. But heck! Maybe in the new place I can get DSL! Yes, this is me looking for a silver lining, why?  Back to work. I've got finals due,  mouse

      Ok! Everything figured out!  Turns out I had two blogs! Both pointing to the same url, so it overwrote itself. When I'd sign in as one (and click "remember me") it'd go to one blog, and then it'd go to the other when I'd sign in as the other.  D'oh! But it's figured out now.  Also, I switched to blogspot because I'm going to have to kill my website (long story involving being hurt badly by a person and having to find a new place to live. AKA, being raped by Souther California slumloards and having to tighten the ol' belt).  I don't think that's even a sentence. Anyhoo, I found the old posts and shoved them in, and am trying to fix up the blog again. Be patient... If there's anybody left out there, that is...

      I'm being seduced!  No, not by a man (that happened long ago, thank god!) but by a new craft.   A creeping, money sucking, insidious craft!   Quilting! Be afraid. Be very, very afraid...   How did this happen? you cry. You are a spinner, a dyer, a knitter... a felter, even, but never a quilter! Have you no shame? Haven't you taken up enough of the house with your craft stuff? Don't you already have so many WIPs that you can't remember what everything is?   yes.   But.... but... Well, ok, here's the thing. Months and months ago I was helping my friend Red make her wedding dress (ok, i was helping by picking out colors. That's the extent of my sewing skills, really,) and we stopped at some fabric store in the Valley. Like, totally fershure! Anyway, while Red was looking at useful stuff, I was off poking in yarn bins. No, they had piles of Bleeding Aorta (red heart) and nothing else. So, despondent, I pick through the books.   And this book... it… attacked me. Snagged my fingers and vomited it's ideas into my brain.   I never knew quilts could look like this. I mean.. wow.   But I'm not a quilter, and I don't have the money/time/space to become one. AND I can't sew.   So I put it down.   ...   So the thought has been eating my brain. Seeping and pricking and making my fingers itch and my sternum vibrate with want. I want to create quilts like that.   My problem? I can't remember the book title! I thought it was "Stained Glass Quilts," but those look more like this and not like what I was looking at at all! These (and these, and these) were more like it... So I decided that it must have been a watercolor quilt book... but none that I have found have had the kind of... looking through a dark window into a garden look of the ones that are eating my brain.   I'm going insane!   It doesn't help that I just got a sewing machine. Now I want to do it even more.   Somebody stop me before it's too late. Or find me that damn book, one of the two.

      ...  Dyeing experiment went well. Screaming purple on the linen. Will post pictures when it's all put together.  Poor  urlLink Wendy . People are being... stupid. Come on, people! It's a copyrighted pattern! I made Wendy a button...     A few thoughts on this:  A) Copyright is good. Copyright makes it possible for people to design stuff and get paid for it. This is a Very Good Thing (to paraphrase Big Evil).  B) It's a poncho. A poncho, people. How hard can it possibly be? The reason that particular poncho is neat is the yarns, and you can pick yarns out, can't you? I mean, come on! I did a search and found 342 hits with  urlLink "knit poncho" pattern free . Poke around a bit. I mean, come on! A poncho is two rectangles attached in such a way that your head fits through a hole it the middle. Make up your own! It's not like this is a pattern that uses extensive charts and patterns, and has lots of little tricky bits that you couldn't possibly figure out on your own.  I guess that's what's bugging me about this. I'm not the smartest pumpkin in the patch, but I'm pretty sure I could figure out how to make a poncho. Especially with the pictures that people have provided. Don't be stupid. Use your brain. If you don't want to buy that pattern, make up your own! Maybe then you'll have 32 people a day ask you for that pattern, and you can say:  Don't be stupid. Be creative.  This rant brought to you by mouse.

      I hate being in limbo! Work is still up in the air, so I have no idea of my future. But I have to plan…  Therefore: I’m announcing my other website:  urlLink www.LindseyRobbins.com   There’s my resume, and a gallery of my work.   If anyone is interested, I will be opening a ‘shop’ to work on graphics: you need a button? Banner? That great picture you took of your sweater needs color correction?  5 $. Almost  anything , 5$. New webring? Need seven or eight graphics for it? Let me know. I do 3D work, web work, photo manipulation, and all sorts of stuff.  Take people out of photos? Sure. Make a picture of you with Orlando Bloom? Fine. De-aging is a specialty of mine. (Who needs plastic surgery? I can fix you up right now!)   urlLink Before Mouse's Magic Makeover   urlLink After Mouse's Magic Makeover   Cheap.  Email me at  urlLink Lindsey.Robbins@gmail.com   Ok, enough pimping, back to the knitting.  I suck. I’ve started and frogged the Madli's Shawl three times. Then I decide to do a smaller repeat until I get the hang of it… frog, frog, frog.  So then I look around in the IK issue for something simpler.  urlLink Kitten  suggested I try for easy lace, rather than start a whole friggin' shawl. I found the Snuggly Baby Hats by Lora Steil in the back of the issue. One is a faggot and lace  pattern that is only like 17 stitches and 8 rows. I mean, I should be able to do that, right?  Wrong. Frog, frog, frog.  Maybe I’m not cut out for lace. Maybe I need to stick to cables and colorwork, so I can see where I am.  And I think there might be a problem with the chart: (NOTE: this is NOT the pattern, it’s just an example to make my point.) It’s supposed to be seed stitch.  On the open squares you knit on the right side, purl the wrong side. On the filled (dots) squares you purl the right side, knit the wrong side.  CHART:    … am I wrong that that produces ribbing? I tried it a few times and got ribbing every time. Am I an idiot? Or am I reading it wrong? Or what?  Not much progress besides that. Fruit hat 2 isn’t going anywhere. The Sophie bag is languishing in my trunk.  I have been doing stuff. I’m about half way done with the teddybear for Red: she picked out these god awful button eyes that look like quarters. “Like the Irish,”  she said. “Pennies on the eyes.” Ok, they make the white bear look even  more  dead than he already did. It’s a little zombie bear. Maybe I should make it drool, or embroider little flies around its head?     I’ll have a picture of Mr. Bear and Red’s Little Dead Bear next time, I think…  The other thing I’m doing is that I’m learning to play the Fiddle. Went to the THING this weekend and learned a few tunes. Love the fiddle. Love MY fiddle…  Got to go for now. Remember, if you’ve got that picture from your weeding, and you need to take out Drunk Cousin Maude from the corner, I can do it. Just email me at Lindsey.Robbins@gmail.com

      What a life. I'm almost certainly going to be let go either this week or next, and, with the Mate unemployed as of three weeks ago, we're in deep, deep trouble.   See, this is what happens when your blood family decides it needs to fall apart; nobody to help me!   But my family by choice,  urlLink Kitten ,  urlLink RtW , and my  urlLink Clan  (Scottish, not KKK, people!) are there for me, and we'll be ok.  On good news, I've learned to use my sewing machine, thanks to  urlLink Kitten . I made a  urlLink teddy bear ! Purple and green plaid, lumpy and bumpy and mine. Ok, so he's a bit Frankenstine monsterish, but he's mine and I love him. I'll put a picture up for Mr. Bear eventually.   Had a good time in general. Checked out the new LYS, Anacapa Fine Yarns, who's website apparently isn't in the Google search engine yet. Neat store, though small, and has a nice variety of yarns, though heavy on the scarf yarn. I don't blame her; scarf yarn sells, and a new store is hard enough to open.   Good news? She's carrying  urlLink Lambs Pride . Yes! Bad news? No  urlLink Cascade 220 . That's ok;  urlLink Rob  and  urlLink Matt  at  urlLink Threadbear  are still my main suppliers, I think. And once things get settled down over there and the Thready Bear project gets going, I'll make Mr. Bear a sweater.  I want to learn to do lace, and I wanted to support the new store, so I bought a magazine (Interweave knits) that has a simple lace pattern in it. Madli's Shawl by Nancy Bush: "Estonian lace in a shawl that's fun to knit." We'll see about that. I know I can get free lace patterns on the web; hell,  urlLink Wendy  put together a  urlLink page of them . But I wanted to support my local store...  The mag also had two more things I want to do; the "Knot a Knitted Paper Bag", and the "Fair Isle Bag", both fun looking and things I would use. Anyway,  urlLink Photobucket  is down, so no pictures, but I'll leave you with a Meme.  Gacked this from  urlLink Marie   Copy this list of literature classics (or at least relatively agreed-upon canon, regardless of how one defines a "classic"), and embolden the ones you've read. Seeing the movie doesn't count!  Like Marie, I've read 25. Strangely enough, (or not) it's a different 25. The ones that are in italics I have read part of but not finished, for whatever reason. Edited to add: actually, 26. I forgot that we read "A Tale of Two Cities" in high school.

        The Great Stash Redistribution Project        Ah, what fun I had! And I took pictures!     The Aran box got to my work Friday, but, as I wasn't there  to get it, I didn't get it till Tuesday. I hopefully will have it in the mail  by this Friday.               The box!     When I opened it, I was wary. So much has been said recently  about the low quality of the contents of the boxes that I was steeling myself for Red Heart and Sugar and Cream Cotton. But LO! Verily, the riches do pour  forth!     Yarn. Yarnyarnyarnyarn!               The cotton: all different kinds. Some beautiful colors, some  baby stuff. Enough yarn to make garments in at least 3 different kinds of yarn. I've never knit with cotton, but I'm a bit afraid of it after all I've read about hurting wrists and such. So I fondled it and put it away.               The wool: not too much wool, but the two skeins of Lopi were interesting. Lopi is one of those yarns I can use without blinking for my Reenactment stuff. But I've got enough wool. I put it aside.               The Fancy: WOO! All sorts of stuff.  urlLink Flora  in two colors (blaze and passion flower?) and  urlLink Eros  in 1024, and ribbon and all sorts of stuff I've never heard of but the colors! The textures! The...  sparkle! Some of it was pure scarf-yarn stuff, but... Fun to look at. Enough in the soft synthetic bocule to make at least 2 tops, one in a bright purple and the other in a color that reminds me, I kid you not, of those  urlLink Circus Peanut  candies. Yuch! A bit of eyelash, in black and white, and other bibs and bobs.     I snagged the Eros.               Other: this is the small section of silk, angora, and Notions  that was in the box. A full set of some kind of dark green silk (note says it's enough for a shirt) and a few handspun skeins of silk. And 2 tiny soft pink angora skeins that I would so take if I could think of a use for baby pink angora yarn... Not enough for a hat or scarf, but I don't think I could make booties that would do it justice. So le sigh, back in the box it goes. A few wooden needles, a peg counter, and some  beautiful   stitch markers.          urlLink        And a bonus: I didn't know there was going to be books in the box! Click on the picture to see it up close. Debbie Bliss &quot;How to knit&quot;, a book called Simply Beautiful Sweaters, and patterns, patterns, patterns. A bunch of crochet stuff, and a sock pattern, and a fiber trends hat pattern.         Well, with all of that, I still have to choose...           I'm snagging the  urlLink Lorna's Laces  sock yarn in the Rainbow colorway, the Eros 1024, and the peg stitch counter. And I'm putting into the box 8 skeins of Lambs Pride. I hope that balances out...     Hmmm.

         I found a picture of the big eyes. Awww.  And that was the same look I had when I saw that the ARAN box had arrived from the GSRP. YEY! I'll go through it tonight, and maybe have pictures tomorrow. Um... don't hold your breath though. I'm bad about promising a picture that doesn't come.  In other news, I'm about 19 rows into the body of Sophie. I've had almost no time to knit at all recently, but a row here and there has been fun. Plus the head-sized ball of yarn in my bag makes me look like Igor, and that's fun too.  Sophie's being knit in a god-awful yellow color. If I was being kind, I'd call it "beeswax" color, as that's what it looks like to me. But I'm not being kind (ask my ex-roommate) and I think it's more goose-turd or jaundiced-mongoose yellow. I like it anyway.

       Good Thursday!  Well, all right, not  that  good. Still looking at a way to make rent after my last day. But an ok Thursday, anyway. Though nobody bit on my offer to do graphics or website stuff on  this  blog, my  other  blog got me a small handful of work. That means I maybe won’t have to start selling stuff to make rent! Yea!  A few posts ago, I showed you the painting I did of the Apple hat, (because I couldn’t find my camera). Well, here is that picture again… and the completed hat! The colors of the painted version are a bit more true than the photo, but I'm lazy and don't want to go re-edit the photo...      &nbsp; It’s tiny. I’ve put it away for a baby gift if somebody I knows suddenly pops. Or maybe I’ll give it to one of those preemie charities…  And I promised pictures of Mr. Bear. Here he is, slumped over like he’s had a hard night drinking… His foot isn't twisted like that... just&nbsp;the way he's sitting. &nbsp;    And, just because I had my camera out this morning, here’s my craft area.   The yarn is all neat and tidy. Each cube has a different kind of yarn:      Upper left  – fancy, expensive, hand spun, or dear-to-my-heart yarn.

       Interesting weekend.&nbsp;We went and saw " urlLink Batboy, the Musical ," which was wonderful. If it is staged around you, I highly recommend it. We saw it at Santa Barbra City College, and the staging was superb. The entire musical is surreal, but so, so funny.     And I managed to knit muchly during the intermission and before it started. I had planed to knit during, but I found I was laughing so hard that I had to put it away. The Mate says that he had the privilege of sitting next to the person who was laughing loudest in the whole theater.  So, what else did I do?  Finished 2 different projects. Ok, finished one, and started and finished another.  First: the  Hat of Very Ugly.      This is the hat. I had intended it to be a kind of elf/wizard hat, or maybe a stocking cap if I could be that patient. The color is crap in this picture.  This is the hat, tip folded over like a stocking cap. I almost kinda like it. Almost.     This is the hat with the point up.     I know what you’re thinking, and you’re right. It looks like a multicolored condom with a reservoir tip. Ack. But, because I love you all, here’s the pattern I made up.   Brain Condom Hat   Yarn: I used crap yarn; Red Heart Worsted. I think it’d look fabulous in some other color… Like white. Needles/gauge: I used a size 5, 16” circ and some DPs I had lying around. Gauge isn’t too important.   Long tail CO about 133 st. This should crowd your needle up so much you can barely knit. Join, being careful not to twist. Your needle should be so crowed that you are never entirely sure that you didn’t twist.  Knit 2 rows, cussing.  Say “Fuck it” or some other epithet. K2 together around hat once. You should have 67 st, or something like that. Realize that you’ve made a ruffle. Blink, and accept that.   Knit a row.   Purl two rows for no apparent reason other than the hat turned itself inside out in your bag and you didn’t notice. Later explain that the purl rows keep the ruffle from curling.  Knit for approx 7 inches. Try on hat. Giggle.  Count your stitches and divide by a random number. I chose 6. Place a marker every 11 stitches, sneaking the extra stitch in somewhere.  Knit to 2 before marker, K 2 together. Repeat around hat.  Knit 2 rows.  Repeat 8 & 9.  Realize the hat is decreasing too fast.  Knit 4 rows.  Repeat 8.  Knit 3 rows.  Begin to decrease every row at a different marker. Doesn’t matter which one.  Continue decreasing until you can’t stand it any more, or you get down to 6 stitches.  Pull the tail through remaining stitches and tie off.  Try on, and realize you look like you have a condom on your head.  Blog about it.   Yes, well…  The second thing I did this weekend was try out a pattern from the book I bought more than a month ago, the ABCs of Making Teddy Bears.     I made the Billi bear. Now, realize that the pattern assumes you will be making said bear out of fur, and so my bear, made of flannel, is rather anemic looking.      But look at that head!     So, I’m going to make him a bigger body, and see about getting proper joints. No store in my town (that I could find) has doll joints, so I thread joined him. He looks kinda… floppy. The Mate calls him “Parkinson bear” because his head jiggles (No offence intended to anyone out there with Parkinson’s disease, or their loved ones. Just a way to describe the head jiggle.)  And, as I am typing this post, I have been informed that I will be “temporarily” laid off in two and a half weeks. Shit. Well, I’m going to go to the  urlLink EDD website  now…. &nbsp;

      Finally set up the camera at work. Pictures!  &nbsp;  This is the lace I'm working on. It's the seashell lace thing (see last post).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     That's a few repeats, stretched out with the help of a drawer, two needles, one hand, and a post-it note...  Here's my backpack, started long, long ago (more than 2 years...) and finished almost a year ago. yes, it's taken me this long to upload pictures... but, in my defense, Kitten just put the grommets in weekend before last...    Before         After . I've been using it as my primary bag for a while, and other than a bit of hole-growing around the strap, it's been great.       And lastly... what happens when you tell Mouse to be ready to go around 8 am and then don't go until 11? She gets... crafty. This is the "AHHHH! I'm bored! Oh, look, a sewing machine!" bag.     Ok it's photoedited to be the bright neon green instead of the olive that the camera picked up, but it is that color, I swear. And yes, I know the flap hem is ragged; was going to do something else with it, and changed my mind. It has a flat bottom (unlike me,) and a nice inside hem on the lip. At some point I'll figure out how to line it correctly, and then maybe my needles won't poke out the felt....

      I just have to share this with you:     That's  urlLink Kitten's  little girl. Isn't she a darling?  urlLink Kitten  just finished her 'lellow' hat, and she was showing it off.  I don't have kids, and sometimes my clock is ticking hard. That little girl both helps, and hurts; I know  urlLink Kitten  and  urlLink The Wanker's  lives have changed a lot since the kids were born, and they can be a bit loud, but...   Sigh. Anyway.  I'm working on a lace scarf, and it's actually working. Who knew? I got the pattern from  urlLink Rob's  sometimes-weekly newsletter... lets see if I can find it. Ah HA!  urlLink "Shells on the beach" . Bad picture. Simple pattern.  I like it. I'm doing a scarf in the random non-wool (it's cotton + something, I think) yarn that I swatched it in, and then maybe pick a variegated to try it again. Maybe double the pattern width. I can never leave good enough alone. I'm always tinkering....  Also, in the pattern it says just to knit the YOs normally... but i found that made the 'hole' almost disappear. So I'm knitting through the back loop of the YO, and the hole is nice and noticeable. Anybody else every have this problem? Is it a function of the weird way I knit? Hmmm.

      Well, I promised you pictures... I LIED! BWHAHHAH!  Ok, I had some camera snafu's this weekend (we went to LB to visit Kitten and the Wanker) and didn't take pictures of anything. But I did the next best thing.  Here's Little Dead Bear, made for Red. I'll get a picture of them together at some point.    And I finally finished the red hat! Bit of a hodge podge; wool hat, acrylic stem, bright flaming green leaf. But its done!    A confession; I did something I never thought I'd do. I thought it was below me, or something. Messy, painful... could lead to things. Dangerous... But look at the colors!    That's Fiesta Jewel Print Mult ... by Red Heart.  Kill me. I bought a skein of Bleeding Aorta, and I love it. Knitting it with metal needles (so they don't squeak) and just kind of dashing off a pattern. I'm shocked at how much I don't mind the acrylic. Usually acrylic has me chewing my fingers off, but this isn't so bad.  And it was $2.50 for a 170 g skein. I'm going to make some hats for my friends who are wool allergic...  No nibbles on my offers to do web graphics. Not marketing myself enough, I don't think. And I probably should spend more than five minutes on ads for my services...

      Finaly, a FO photoshoot!     That's Red and Little Dead Bear, who she calls Deady Fredy. [ETA: It's Deady Teddy, as some Yetti has corrected me. ]  Red is wearing my version of the  urlLink RockStar Scarf  I made her for Christmas... two years ago? Something like that. I used lime green mohair and Lion brand fun fur becuase it was what I had. She seems to like it, and says it's very warm.  See? the painting I did of Little Dead Bear looks just like him...
