       Within a week i found myself twice in a little discussion about differences between msuic from the 60s/70s and even 80s and music nowadays. We wondered if today musicians are still making legendary music, like Led zeppelin did. The sad conclusion of most people was that the answer must be no.... but i don't want to be so pessimistic!!! Yes the record industry decides/d which musicians make it and who don't for a great deal at least, but somewhere on this planet there must be musicians that 'invent' new music, something we've never heard before... do you know any? Where can we find them? Where do they hide???(they must have a website or something like that???)

       Unfortunately I'm from the past records era, I never really experienced the thrill of buying a new record: admiring the cover in the store, cycling home with this huge sleeve under your arm, entering your room and carefully placing the record on the player. So many other things make the record a perfect product: admiring the art on the sleeve, opening and getting the record out, your private little scratches, that make the record yours... In fact I have only one record, Bob Marley, purchased it on a fleemarket, listened to it a few times at my parents house... one day I come home: no player anymore... i don't know where the record is right now...It made me wonder, does the cd have any rituals, which ones??? Most people check out the booklet once, after buying the cd, if there is a booklet of course. but after that, a cd is just a cd, of course, the music on it is of good quality, but... shouldn't it be more than that?I think i should look for 'listening rituals'... do you have any??
