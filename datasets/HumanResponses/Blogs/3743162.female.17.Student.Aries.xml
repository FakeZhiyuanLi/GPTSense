      The fun thing about babysitting is that when you're a teenager and you're never in charge of anything and most people wouldn't trust you with their cars, they put you in charge of their kids. As a favor I'm babysitting my best friends siblings ( 10 boy 7 girl) while she works and her parents are outta town. I don't really like babysitting, but I love these kids and my friend needs to work to save money to go to school next year since she graduated. Anyways I'm bored while waiting for Sex and the City repeats to come on BRAVO so...  Whats new with anyone? Anyone out there? Guess not... thats like life too, sometimes its just nice to hear yourself talking. (or writing but whatever its the same thing!!!) TV and napping awaits me on the couch....

      Today I wake up because the phone is ringing, and I go to answer it, drop it, pick it up and answer it, but by this time I'm so wide awake I'll never sleep again, in fact I missed my 3:00 nap becuase I'm still so wide awak. Anyhow it was my boyfriend, wanting to hang out, so he came over and we walked to a restaurant for lunch. It was really fun, we goofed around for hours walking around and it's sooooooooo nice outside, like 20 degrees, which is really hot for alberta. I had so much fun but then I had to go to volunteering at the Nursing Home. (I play BINGO there... yes I know, it's very stereotypical)  Anyways I really realized how much fun it is to do nothing with someone... it's nice to be going out with someone that you can be really comfortable with, and though we're really used to each other we still can suprise each other and it's still great to talk to him... I know I sound so young, I feel so stupid when I talk about being in love and stuff just becuase I honestly know nothing about it, except how I feel... it's like, what do I know about being in love and commitment and trust and stuff like that, I'm only 17, but a part of me wants to think that I know tons about it becuase I've expirienced it... who knows... I think that I think too much!!! I should just enjoy myself but I constantly worry more than I need to.

      Hi!!!!!!  I'm so excited for summer... I love summer. I guess everyoen does, so thats kinda stupid but i REALLY love summer. i'm not sure that this summer's going to be as amazing as i want it to be... its the last summer before i turn 18 so i really want a memorable, responsibility free summer... but you know how summer is never as perfect as you plan it in june. oh well, i'm still hoping for the perfect summer.  the sad part is that now grade 11 is over... for me, june is the end of the year, not december so i always get a little reminsceful at the end of a school year. i enjoy high school so much and this year went by so fast that im sad cause i know itll be over before i know it! the problem with this year was that nothing changed. after grade 10 was such a wild year with boyfriends and friends and craziness, this year was so static. i'm dating the same guy as i was at the beginning, i have the same best friends as i did at the beginning... everythings stagnated... i wish something would shake things up a bit! i remember my crazy skipping school adventures days of grade ten and i worked sooo hard in grade 11 (it REALLY paid off!!!) that i never had the same fun as i did in grade 10... so im really looking forward to some insane stuff happening all summer.  i know people can respond to my messages, so tell me your plans for summer?
