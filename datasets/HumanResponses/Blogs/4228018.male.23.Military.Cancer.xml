      Well, here it is. My first attempt at a decent post in this new blog. Don't know how to start really... I suppose I could talk a bit about myself and what I do but how cliche is that? Good. Lets get rolling shall we.  I'm  23 years old.. Grew up in the wine country of California.. Amador County that is.. Not that wanna-be Napa Valley bullshit, or the Gallo-Ghetto known as Sonoma. The REAL heart of California wine. The epitome of no-where, but thats the way it should be. It's always been funny to talk to another Californian and ask them where they hail from.. and know almost exactly where that is and when pressed with the same question, getting this look of "Where?" Some times the best places on earth are the least known.  Now I live in Virginia Beach, VA  What do I do?  My primary job in life is that of a Husband to my wife Stacy and father to my 2 year old daughter Adriana... However since there isn't a whole lot of money to be made in that particular field I suppliment myself in between by serving active duty in the United States Navy. For now, (meaning the next couple of weeks) I'm a 3rd Class Fire Controlman serving aboard the USS Monterey (CG-61), however shortly I'm transferring to Master-At-Arms "A" schoold (navy cop for you civilian types), and after that I'll be attached to Mobile Security Detachment Two Two out of Portsmouth, VA.  I've been in the Navy for 4 years now and I can honestly say in that time I have done absolutely nothing remarkable or for that matter.. worth while.. I can't say I count spending a year and a half learning a job that I had no real interest in but took merely because what I really wanted, was not open for new members at my time of enlistment (Master-At-Arms). Not that working with electronics and making things go KABOOM are a bad thing.. It just doesn't flow well with what I want to do if I decide to get out of the Navy, which is be a Cop. Strangely enough the best time I've had so far in my 4 years was when I was between schools, doing temp. duty as a security guard up at Naval Training Center, Great Lakes Illinois.. Which had nothing to do with what I do currently.. Go figure.  It almost makes me feel as if the past 4 years of my life have been somewhat wasted. Not that I'm not PROUD of the fact that I serve my country (which I am), it's just that I havn't been doing it in the way that I imagined I would, or for that matter WANT to. Sitting here, on a ship be it tied to the pier, or underway in the Med. Sea I dont' feel any sense of accomplishment or a sense of purpose.  I've just now come to realize I havn't fully explained exactly what it is I do. So I think I'll take a quick time out in the rest of my rambling to maybe shed some light into my not-so-glorious job. (If you're a fellow squid reading this, disregard)  Fire Controlman, are not what the average Joe-Bloe think us to be.. When asked what I do, folks usually take my response of "I'm a Fire Controlman" to mean that I have something to do with fighting fires. Not the case at all.. In fact the only thing that we have to do with fires is perhaps that we START them. FC's (as I will refer to us as from now on) work with electronics of all kinds.. from Radars to Display systems, usually in support of some kind of Fire Control system for some kind of weapon.. Ranging from the "Tomahawk Missle" that you hear about on the news to the 5-Inch gun systems found on todays surface combatants. So, in short.. when it comes to the enemy .. We put a "Warhead on their Forehead". Sounds great?! Yeah.. sure does so head on down to your local recruiting station and sign up! Back to reality..  I can't speak for all FC's because with many things everybody's milage varies. However in my case I can say it's been the least glorious job that I've ever done and when it boils down to it  I can honestly say that I've never fired a shot in anger at anything more menacing than a floating target made out of empty powder casings.. and that was with a M-60 Machine gun. My particular piece of the very broad FC pie is that of a Mk. 86 Gun Fire Control System technitian.. Or.. the system that is used to control and fire the 5 inch guns onboard my ship. The last time I've personally fired them was over a year ago.. and that was 6 rounds out the barrel before the gun had a mechanical problem that couldn't be rapidly fixed. Fun.  I'm going to dig a bit deeper because I keep thinking of stuff as I sit here and write. How marvelous.  You recall I stated I've been in the Navy for 4 years.  I've been onboard a ship and part of the surface fleet for exactly 17 months.  2.5 years were spent in my basic training.. I.e Boot Camp, A-School, Temp Duty, C-School. Then when I reported aboard my ship I was almost immediatly sent to the mess decks to do my 4 month tour as a "food service attendant".. So I was the classic example of the sailor peeling potatoes and washing dishes (everybody has to do it at some point or another). Then, I got to work as a Fire Controlman for about 5 months.. But then I think more time was spent sweeping passageways, chipping paint, painting, needle gunning or whatever bullshit preservation work we had to get done for whatever reason.. I can count on 2 fingers how many times I actually spent any kind of time with my finger in my equipment, and that was when something was broken and HAD to be fixed. Well, in that 5 month time I learned that even though I wanted to re-enlist.. I could do so.. but NOT as a FC (WAHOO!).. I could pick another job though.. Perfect opportunity to shoot for Master-At-Arms or (MA from now on).. Well I got picked up for the conversion, and then.. Instantly seen as "not worthwhile to spend the time training on the system because you'll be leaving". Not that I'm a bad guy though...  So.. I then spent 5 months working in the Ships Armoury where I did stuff like clean pistols and.. oh sweep passageways and.. paint... and chip... whoop-de-fucking-doo.  HEY LOVE COMPUTERS! BE AN FC! YOULL GET TO WORK ON THEM ALL THE TIME! Bitch, please. Meanwhile I was working on the side in the ships Force Protection Division.. Pretty cool, but again..nothing to do with Fire Control.. and I'll end my 17 month tour on the USS Monterey in that FP division. Good stuff.. Nice working hours. Working "out" of rate, but then working "in" rate to some extent for my new job. Cool beans.  Back to my original point before I get even further sidetracked than I allready am.. In short I've spent 4 years in the military basically spinning my wheels and not going anywhere. Well, if you look at in light of the fact I spent all that time getting trained in one job, only to work it for a short period of time before switching to something else.. But at least it's the job that i actually wanted from the beginning so it works out for me.. but not for you as a taxpayer who payed for $60,000 worth of training that I never really got to  use.  However I am looking forward to whats coming up in the future and of course as time goes on I'll be updating this little peice of the 'net with whats going on and what is newsworthy to the readers (which I'm sure will just be friends and family).. Speaking of that.. they are why I'm doing this. I figured if I send the link for this little website to them, it will be a good way to let the ones that know me hear whats going on in my life. Saves on phonebills. heh.  Thats all for now.. It's 2200, and I need to wake up in 5 hours... Lates.
