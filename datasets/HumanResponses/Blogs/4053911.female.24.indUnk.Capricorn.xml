       I hate Saturdays because there is almost nothing to watch on TV, even on cable. My hunny went to Apple Valley today to help his best friend move. I stayed home. I have been incredibly bored since 10:00 am. I hope he comes home soon so we can go get some desert. We made a deal, I stay home, he goes by himself, and when he gets home he takes me out to go get a piece of pie from Bakers Square. I hope they have strawberry rubarb. I can only seem to find it in hillbillie towns, but I will cross my fingers and hope. I am also hoping on lemon cream. It is hard to find a good piece of pie these days.

       Well I did get a job, but I will not reveal the name of where I work. I think the way they work is done illegally. They have about 20-25 employees and not one of them has health insurance. They refuse to let you have a "10" minute break (state law says you are entitled to one), they say all I get is a 30 minute lunch break. Everybody in there glares at each other, they also snarl at each other. I think I know why, nobody makes over $10.00 an hour and they are all treated like slaves! In fact they don't even make anywhere near $10.00 an hour. It is more like $7.50 (that is 75 cents above minimum wage)!!! The place is dirtier than dirt. In fact it is unhealthful, unsanitary, unclean, dirty!!!! The restroom (by the way, you don't even get a restroom break, which is hard since I am female with female functions) is soo dirty! There is no toilet bowl liners, almost no toilet paper, no paper towels to dry your hands, and no soap to wash your hands. It is soo gross! In the laboratory there is leftover food all over the place, I am soo sure that I am going to come home with a pet roach. They encourage you to come in relaxed by wearing whatever you feel like (which is OK, except....), including flip-flops!!! If somebody were to drop a lens on there toe and cut it off, they would be sued big time!!! Idea! I will go and cut my toe off and sue and never work ever again! They have an airconditioner, however it is broken, but they keep it on because there is one vent that works, nobody knows where the vent is, but supposedly it works. And when it is time to go home, they look at the clock and decide to give you about an hours worth more training. Damn fuck-heads! I had visions all day yesterday and today of people being shackeled to balls and chains while the Koreans laughed and whipped us with a whip while slave driving us. I really need to look for something better.

        Why am I here, I don't know? I have been reading my friends blogs for the past 2-3 months and I think, since I have depression, this might help when I am angry at the world for not letting me find a descent paying, Monday through Friday job. I have been looking for the past 2 months and all I get is "you are not experienced enough" or "you do not speak spanish". Why do I have to speak spanish? This is America, NOT Mexico! If we went and moved to Mexico, then I would learn. Until then NO!

        I just wanted to post a photo of dream wedding dress, so here it is. I also just figured out how to copy and paste the picture on here, so I am actully excited about that, and have to use my new talent.      Well, maybe I am not that talented because this does not seem to be working. We will find out after I post this....

        Well I got a new job, however the excitement has worn off. Probably because this is my third in 2 weeks. I do not start until Monday. But at least I know that it is with a good company this time. I get free laser eye surgery after 1 year of employment, 401K plan, health benefits, paid vacation and time off, sick pay, Monday through Friday and occasionally Saturdays. It was a whole new position, so I will be the Queen of my position. I would like to think that it was created just for me, but I know better. Oh well. At least I will get better pay now! Whoopie!

        I woke up today with a migrane, and it sucks. I had the day off today. I am beginning to wonder if the law office is going to fire me or not. In many ways I hope so. The lady I work for is very impatient. She has me looking for files, that do not exist and won't give me the slightest clue on where to find them. I will ask her but she will say to me that they could be anywhere. So I think to myself look everywhere. When I start doing that and start opening every box looking for these files, she comes to me and says "Charlotte, why would they be in there? That is not a place that we keep our files!" Uhh, maybe because you said they could be anywhere? Then she has me listen to the voice mail system and retrieve all their messages. Some people say stuff soo fast that you can't understand what they just said. Or they will leave a super long message and the end is when they leave a number, and they don't repeat the number, and could not but only get the first part of the number. 555-???? So you have to listen to the 5 minute message again, and when you get to the number part again, somebody comes along and starts talking in your other ear, and back you go to starting line again. And with 20 messages, they wonder why you are on the phone for 10 minutes trying to get all the messages. Half way through the messages I get one that goes something like this "Hola! Como esta? Blah, blah, blah, blah!" So I save it so, they figure out the Spanish, and when I am done, I let them know there was two in Spanish. Irma then looks at me crazy, and says " You  don't speak Spanish??? I thought  you  spoke Spanish, that was our requirement for this job! Claudia, told me  you  spoke Spanish. We will have to discuss this!" And here I am " Nobody asked me if I could speak Spanish, and I know Claudia did not say that, she knows I don't speak it". I even asked her whether or not she said that, and she said she told her I can say "No habla espaniol, uno momento!" Shortly after that the Lawyer comes and asks if I know how to use the internet, and asks me to make Yahoo! his home page, because the "cleaning guys" came along and played on his computer, and changed it to "sexfoto.com". I thought yeah right, pervert! Lets back up a little bit. Claudia tells them she has a friend that is looking for work and is having trouble finding it right now. Fred says, "Is she cute and sexy??!!". Given that information, I now know how he got sexyfoto.com to be his home page. And he probably thought he would look cute by having me fix his problem. Dirty Bastard!     On a better note 2 weeks from yesterday, I will be going to court for my car accident from just over two years ago. They are desperately trying to settle my case before the date, and Claudias job today is to try and have my medical bills reduced from about $6,000 to about $2,500 - 3,000. That should leave me with (after paying meds and lawyer) about $3,000. I hope for more and pay off my car completely. I really want to go buy myself a beautiful wedding dress, but maybe not. I will start hoping and praying for myself that I will come home with $10,000 to play with, and if you come across this pray for me, cause I need it.

        Well on Friday when I got home, my buddy at the law office calls me up and says to me that the owners of the building need a receptionist Monday through Friday 8 AM to 5 PM. That is 8 hours and a 1 hour break. And it is $10.00 bucks an hour! See, I knew I was deserving more money! The only thing is, if I get the position, I will have a hard time looking for work in my career (optical dispensing), and will not be able to go to my interviews. That sucks, but it is much better than the lazy people I work for right now. In many ways, I am so happy that I am not there full time, but only for a measly 2 - 4 hours. I guess as long as it covers my car payment and insurance, I am happy. My weekend was fun. I was invited to my buddy's sister's 21st birthday on Saturday. But my hunny had golfed all day and got sunburned badly on his face (he looks like a tomato), and was too exhausted to drive there. So we stayed home and rented  The Secret Window  by Stephen King. The movie was not all it cracked up to be. I expected a thriller, but only got "huh?". Sunday, we went to Roberts friend, Kevins, house (Yeah I know, I never used names before, but I realize that maybe only one person reads this, so who cares???). We stayed over there since they have A/C, and digital cable. We do not have A/C, and only have regular cable, and yes, it still exists. We stayed the whole day, and Robert promised if they ordered Papa John's Pizza he would pay half the next day (today). Papa John's is the Mecca of pizza, they have a garlic-butter dipping sauce that you dip your pizza crust into that is to die for. It gets me butter drunk. When I die though, I know they will find that my organs and intestines will be full of butter, and the mortician will wonder "what the fuck are they eating these days?". And here I am sitting and writing this and now I realize that if I don't hurry up and get off soon, and eat and get ready for my hell hole job   I will be late.

       I just woke up and feel a little compelled to write something. What, I don't know? I am mad at DH (darling hunny) for being such a A-hole, and not letting me sleep in. For some reason he thinks I need to get up and play at 5:00 AM, but not to sleep until 7:15 AM.  Damn people.    I quit my first job at the laboratory, not just quit, but I left to lunch only to never be seen by the freaks again. 2 Hours later, I was at a new job in an attorneys office copying papers and putting stamps on mail for 50 cents more an hour. It is much better than job 1, except the lawyer is very needy. He asks me to look for a file, but then he finds it, and comes to retrieve me and point it out for me to hand it to him. For godsakes, man, you were touching it! The first day he came to retrieve me to pick up the files from his desk, that he claimed to accidentally knock down. From what I could tell he got mad and knocked them down, and then looked for me to pick them up. The girl who worked there before me (according to my buddy), he dropped a paperclip and looked and looked for her for about 15 minutes, before finding her to have her retrieve the paperclip from the floor. Dude, wouldn't it be easier to pick it up yourself? It would be a lot less time consuming! Charquie, what the hell did you get yourself into? Maybe all this running around will make me loose 50-40 pounds. Lets hope for me, OK?
