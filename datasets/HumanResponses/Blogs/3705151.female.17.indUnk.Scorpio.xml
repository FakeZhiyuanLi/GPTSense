      That was an interesting little thing I had going in my head when I got Mr. Softie after delivering CD's somewhere uptown.  It would have been a lot funnier if someone had actually questioned my ability to finish the ice cream before I got back.  Anyway, wow, there are now way too many Matt's in my life. There's "Lub" Matt, "Chester" Matt, "Moose" Matt, "Plattsburgh Hookup" Matt, "Money" Matt (who I guess is now out of my life, but he was in my history class for a while), and now "$100 Amp" Matt.  This is one of my bosses at the recording studio. He went to this other studio that was closing and ended up buying a tube amp from the 60's made by SEARS of all places, and only for $100. I admit it sounds amazing.  The distortion is just really cool, but it was the only thing he talked about all day.  Anyway, people have to start coming up with more original names for their children.  The whole point of a name is to kind of distinguish people from each other, so if one of these Matt's were lost in a mall when they were 5, and their mom called out for them, she wouldn't get an answer because there would be about 400 other Matt's to answer.  People should just name their kids what they suspect their nicknames will be.  Like Lub Lubchansky, Chester Chester (a boy so nice they named him twice), or...well...Moose Russell doesn't really sound that great.  Alright, bad idea.  I saw Eric Clapton in concert last night at Live Porn Gardens (it's never going to be MSG again).  I went with my uncle.   When we walked in, I just remembered being there 3 nights ago, and the crazy things I had seen there.  And now I was with this 57 year old who has never really warmed up to me but is trying his darndest.  The only piece of advice he had for a while was "you're not buying a tee-shirt for $40." But after seeing Robert Randolph and the Family Band open, everything was great. And then Clapton. Oh...to be that guitar. He just makes it look so easy.  It was all this great blues stuff and then he ended with the one-two punch of "Lela" and "Cocaine." I tell ya, if you can get an entire stadium to yell "Cocaine" at the top of their lungs, you're cool, nothing more to say about it.  He then encored with "Sunshine of Your Love" and had Robert Randolph come back on and he was so good and he had his slide guitar and is from Jersey and no one I know plays a slide guitar like that I mean he just solos and kicks out his chair and completely rocks the place and was amazing and WOW no one knows what the fuck I am talking about.  Well, it was cool.  And I had this scary dream last night that my mom tried to force me into this Indian ceremony that would make me accept some God as my God, and she tricked me into showing up at my grandparents house for the ceremony and once I figured it out she was furious that I wouldn't go through with it, so all my friends and I ended up running back to the city from Englewood, NJ. If anyone has any ideas as to what this means, that would be great, because I'm really lost.

      I'm not really sure what to say about today. I went up to Hawthorne to Houms graduation party.  There was family, I got an awesome necklace and matching earrings from his mom, and we played  urlLink Egyptian Ratscrew  with Jon, Chester, Ally and Zach.  All in all it was a lot of fun.  But, there were a few things that bothered me. Not my friends, I love them all to death. Honestly, I could not wish for better people in my life.  But whenever I informed someone of my going to Tulane, their first response was always "oh...Party school."  One guy even went so far as to make a Girls Gone Wild joke.  I know I should probably be expecting this.  I mean, the school is in New Orleans for Christs sake.  Alcohol is like the state bird or something.  But I'm worried that this'll be what I'll carry with me wherever I go. I try to defend myself, saying Tulane is a really good school (which it is), but is this what I'm going to have to do at every job interview? Explain that I'm really not that into drinking and did my work and got a good education instead of chugging the alcoholic slurpees they have on every corner? I really don't feel like doing that.  Today also raised another question in my mind. Actually, it's more of a fear. I've been worried about this for a while, but I don't know, today just seemed to bring it out. As I was on the train home (which seemed a hell of a lot faster than the train there), I got to thinking about my friends. As I said before, I could not wish for better friends. They just make me so happy. I can't describe it any better than that. And I know a lot of my friends and I have lived a far way away from each other (Chappaqua, Ossining, Connecticut...), but through it all we have kept in touch. However, I know college is different.  People will already be surrounded by friends, or people who will soon become friends.  And as ecstatic I am about my friends, do they feel the same about me? Are they going to want to keep in touch with me? Or, worst of all, will I keep in touch with them? Half of the reason why I started this damned blog was as a way to keep in touch. I could write down what happens to me and my friends could read it, and I could keep them in my life.  But I am deathly afraid that they will fall away.  But for now, I am savoring every moment I have with them. I have always savored every moment, but now I'm savoring it even more.  Like a burger with A1 sauce. I already love burgers, but when they have A1 sauce, oh man, I love them even more. So I guess A1 would be equivalent to summer or something, and the burger is obviously my friends. Yeah, that's how that metaphor goes...Where the fuck did that come from?

      So last night Jon, Houm and Marcy came into the city. We were all going to see Incubus at MSG.  Oh, how innocent we were then.  After hanging with Ross and Travi at a record store, getting sushi and discussing Ross's 14 year old ex-girlfriend's vaginal herpes, we sadly parted and made our way to the venue.  Then, sadly again, Jon and Marcy had to split up with Houm and I, as they had better seats and weren't about to sacrifice them to spend some time with their beloved friends.   But lo! Lauren was there! Marcy's best friend, who I have met on several occasions and enjoyed every time.  And she sat only a few rows away from us! Double trouble. So Incubus played and it was glorious.  I'm serious, best time I've had in a while.  If only Houm didn't recall every single bit of Incubus trivia he has stored in his frizzy, Einzingered head.    Here's where it gets cool.  As we walk out of the stadium, meeting at a silver Lincoln Mercury on display in the foyer, we spot the tour busses! From behind the display and out of the wall made of glass, we see three beautiful busses parked right outside, and only a short row of hedges keeping us from them!  So we ran. We ran as fast as our tired legs could carry our contact-high bodies.  We sit, Houm takes out his program, and we wait, hoping for the chance to meet them.    From where we were waiting, you can see the Lincoln Mercury. Well, not the car itself, but the back of the lovely screen that was accenting it in the lobby.  So I look up at one point and what do I see behind that screen? In front of those glass windows that go from floor to ceiling? Boobs. Thats right, boobs. Two of them. On a woman of course. Oh, and a man massaging those boobs.  Apparently some drunken couple thought it would be a good idea to hook up behind this thing, not realizing that about 50 people had a clear view of them.  Oh yeah, and there was a penis too.  She unbuttoned his pants and started playing with that.   So, after telling my friends what did we do? We did what any self respecting New Yorkers and Westchesterians would do...  We applauded We cheered We screamed and laughed and made all the other 50 people there do the same thing.  Evenutally the couple turned around to see us. And what did they do? They did what any self respecting drunken concert-goers would do. They continued! In fact, they made a show of it!  The girl pulled his penis all the way out of his pants and played with it. She even went so far as to get on her knees (ON YOUR KNEES BITCH!) and put the whole thing in her mouth, while the guy was turned to us with his hands in the air as if to say "IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY!"    So what was the climax of this escapade? (heh...climax).  The cops of course.  With the girls hand firmly grasping his dick, and with his hands nearly glued to her chest, a security guard miandered behind the screen.  The guy saw and quickly turned around, while the girl hid behind him. After zipping up his pants he was taken away, as three more security guards showed up.  The girl was desperately fumbling with her shirt when one of the guards held up her bra that had been on the floor with one finger and a disgusted face. She too was escorted away.  Only in New York baby...

      God I love my friends...  So yeah, yesterday I spent the day with LK and Boman. Weird combination, but it was fun. We got ice cream and scared the shit out of ourselves with the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I really don't understand that.   I mean, first off, it's a remake. And since the original was the funniest thing I've ever seen I really doubted that the remake would have an effect on me. But even with Jessica Beil and no wheelchair kid and the addition of some random baby, it left me with that annoying tingly feeling in my chest...which could only be chased away by Ben & Jerry's Peanut Butter Cup eaten straight out of the pint.  When I got home, Emily K came over. We ate waffles, got more ice cream (it's really a wonder that I can leave my house without the help of a crane), I make her kidneys nervous, and played with her tamogatchi.  I really miss those things. I had one, but like all of my passions in middle school, it went out of style.  And being the insecure, frizzy little pig I was, I wasn't going to be caught dead with something that could have dropped my social status even lower than it was.  Oh well, I guess it's eBay ho!

      No, that's not what the message actually said. But it was pretty funny having that be the first voicemail I had to transcribe at work.  Everyone was cracking up, and I'm sure the look on my face was less than perfect. Anyway, I work in a basement. No windows, dusty smell, surrounded by kegs of beer for the bar upstairs. But I'm not going to say anything too bad, because I am rather good friends with the daughter of my overlord (a girl who is currently under house arrest).  But suffice it to say I had a good time and am actually excited about going back.  Now what else to say? What other observations do I have to make? So soon after creating this damned thing I don't want to revert into LiveJournal mode and start whining about relationships and feelings and nobody likes me everybody hates me blah blah blah JUMP OFF OF A FUCKING BUILDING ALREADY! But what to say?  I remember sitting at a computer today with some great thoughts on the world around me, thinking I should write them down for my blog, but I didn't. Do I have to always be observing things? Remembering them and analyzing them as I walk down the street? I guess the damn quakers taught me to analyze from day one of 8th grade. Books were never the same after I learned about metaphors and motifs and whatnot.  Whenever I read a book for pleasure, I can't just have it be pleasurable anymore. Most of the time I scrutinize and judge 'till I just get tired of it and don't want to read anymore. And I hate that because I love reading.  I want to train myself to live in the moment.  I want to get lost in an experience. I want to forget about how something could be better, or about what I wish would happen. I want to be happy with everything around me, even if it isn't perfect.  So I guess I did have a point to make.

      Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Sharpie has been making fun of my non-blogged-ness on her's for eons now. Well you know what? In your face sucka 'cause I finally got a blog. OH SNAP!  Now for the first delightfully pretentious entry:  I was watching VH1 and they had this "Urban Dictionary" excerpt where they explain all the hot vocabulary that you wouldn't normally be able to keep up with. "Blog" was on there, and was described as an internet journal that is open to the public and created by people "with no shame."  And they say that like it's a bad thing.  I don't understand what's wrong with having little or no shame.  Wasn't shame that pesky feeling that Adam and Eve got once they were kicked out of paradise?  "Out" is the key word here. By posting all of my stupid feelings on this website, I can actually live like I'm in a sort of paradise fantasy land. Where everyone cares about each other and no one feels like they have anything to hide and we can all just be honest. So however corny that sentiment is, I'm glad for it, and thanks Blogger.  In other news, I start work tomorrow. For those of you who don't know me, I'm a music freak.  It's my life, my passion.  The drums always get me in my heart, the guitar in my soul, and for some reason the bass always reverberates in my groin. Maybe that's why I've dated the people I have. Anyway, I digress. I start work at a live music venue called The Living Room tomorrow.  This is it. This is my big break. Within a week I'm going to have Epitaph records knocking down my door wanting me forgo college and move to L.A.  CBGB's is then going to quickly whisk me away to run the joint while the owner is in rehab, and under their nose I will be searching the city for the perfect spot to open my own venue! Muahahah! They'll never see it coming! And I'm going to have all of my favorite bands and all of my friends and it's going to be the paradise I so speak of.  And it all starts tomorrow. Woot!

      Nothing much has happened to me this week. I feel as if maybe this blog has been going downhill ever since the rave reviews of the  urlLink condom rant  or  urlLink live porn , but while nothing has happened to me, very very important things have happened to those I care about, and I seem to be caught in the middle.   Ever since I was about 11, many of my friends have relied on me for relationship advice. Let's just ignore the fact that I didn't get a real boyfriend until 2 days before I turned 15, and that that relationship lasted less than 3 weeks.&nbsp; For some reason all of my self-proclaimed mature middle school friends would turn to me every time their boyfriend fingered them in a movie theater, or some other girl flirted with their crush. I even had to spend a weekend with my friend Natalie and her beau Seth because she was afraid to be alone with him.   That last one was especially fun because, at the time, I had a mad crush on Seth, pretty&nbsp;much like everyone else did. He was a fad. Went in and out like platform shoes.&nbsp; I ended up being the only one he didn't date.   &nbsp;I have no idea where this comes from, but I kind of take pride in it. I like that people feel comfortable enough to me to call me on a rainy evening and confess their deepest relationship feelings to me.&nbsp; I like being someone people can trust with that kind of stuff.&nbsp; But am I doomed to be the one that people talk about relationships to and never see as more than a confidant?   NO! NO! I'M REVERTING INTO LIVEJOURNAL FORM! BAD JAYA! BAD JAYA!   LIFE IS GOOD!!!!!

      My friend Gilly is doing half of her dissertation on Elizabeth Bishop, so I figured I should start out my post with an homage to my favorite poem of hers (can you spell "pretentious"?).   Wow, there was a lot of punctuation in that last sentence.&nbsp; I hope it was right. Help, Frankie.   Anyway, the quote also explains exactly how I feel right now. I am in the process of having the best day ever, after having a great weekend, so right now my life is looking pretty good. This weekend I went up to Lenox, Mass for a friends wedding.&nbsp; I stayed in a mansion (no joke, calculating the square footage, 10 of my apartments could fit into this place, not counting the 8,000 sq. Ft. They rent out to another family, and they have a fucking pool room! A pool table with a room large enough to accommodate it!), played croquet, walked and talked out all of my problems with Gilly, &nbsp;and in general was forced to embrace my inner WASP.&nbsp; The family I was staying with (the brides parents) are exactly the type of people I imagined when I read  The Great Gatsby. &nbsp; They are witty, party-going, fun people who's main goal in life is to have a good time (with a full bar following them every step of the way).&nbsp; The cream jackets and seersucker suits flew by, along with that ugly, dusty rose color on pants and EVERYBODY wearing some sort of animals on their body. Turtle ties, lobster belts, whale socks, anything.&nbsp; But it was beautiful.&nbsp; The groom cried, setting off a chain reaction in which there was not a dry eye in the house.&nbsp; Swing music blared as the oyster bar was emptied (mostly by me) and 6 hours and 3 glasses of champagne later I crashed.   The next morning my mom, the lovely woman that she is, agreed to drive me to that land of lore that has haunted my memory for so long, Buck's Rock Summer Camp.&nbsp; I had been upset when we left because a lot of my friends had planned a mini road trip up there, and I was supposed to be driving back that day.&nbsp; But Route 7 (bless it's soul) provided a straight line south from Lenox, so she agreed to drop me off if I could bum a ride off of Jon.&nbsp;   It was glorious.&nbsp; The second I got there, Bethany came running towards me, followed quickly by Ross and Colin (surprisingly sans Justine.)&nbsp; Everything was familiar, and I felt as if I had never left.&nbsp; What made it even more special was that it was exactly two years ago Saturday that I had met most these people for the first time, at exactly the same spot where I met them yesterday.&nbsp; We went to radio, where old pictures of some of us were still stuck sporadically to the walls (I like alliteration.)&nbsp; I saw the gray spot on a stool where what I thought was dry paint had marked, and where I sat down only to have it stick to the back of my pants. I think some of the paint is still there.&nbsp; There was Colin Matthews and Julian and Ali and Roger. I spotted Eloise from a distance.&nbsp; Alexis wore a shirt from a deli a block and a half from where I work.&nbsp; There was a totem pole where a tree used to be, and a lot of new faces, but all in all it still felt like home.&nbsp; We went out to pizza, talked about stuff that we probably didn't want to know about each other, but found out anyway, and then drove home.&nbsp;   And today. Oh today. I got out of work! Somehow they had double booked interns today, so we tossed a coin and I got to take the day off.&nbsp; It is a perfect day anyway.&nbsp; The sky is clear, but it's not too hot.&nbsp; A light breeze, a few clouds, perfect.&nbsp; So I walked out of the SOHO studio today with the city as my oyster.&nbsp; I decided the best way to spend it would to be in my own neighborhood, savoring every detail before I leave.&nbsp; So I found myself a spot atop a little hill in Thompkins Square Park, lay down in the sun, and read.&nbsp;   Reading in the sun really does something to a person. I emerged about an hour later slightly dizzy and kind of fuzzy.&nbsp; I sort of floated off of my mound to Pick Me Up cafe, where I encountered the best iced coffee in the city.&nbsp; I wandered around for a bit, before deciding it would be best to come home and probably rest or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't slept well in a while.&nbsp; But I'm happy right now.&nbsp; The sun is out, Talking Heads is blaring on my iTunes, I have a good book and a stocked fridge at my disposal.   Ahhh....

      Why is it that random guys on the street can whistle and hoot and yell "hey, sweetheart, come over here, I got something for ya" until their faces turn blue, but the guys who's calls I would actually respond to never seem to see me in that way?

      Ok, so yesterday started like any other day.&nbsp; I went to work, got hit on by a 40 year old mexican van driver, loaded ProTools and a spliter box into the back of a car, got invited to a concert by a hot intern, talked about Aqua Teen Hunger Force with a hotter intern, went to dinner with my mom and came home, where I set upon my quest of finding out what the weird smell was that was eminating from my room. &nbsp; I had noticed this smell about a week ago, but decided not to bother, figuring it was dirty socks or underwear or shoes or something.&nbsp; Finally, my mom told me to find out what is was because she (understandably) hates bad smells. So I searched my room for the culprit, mining through every drawer and shelf until I had almost given up.  I started a new load of laundry, sprayed all of my socks with perfume, and decided to try my closet once again.  So I knelt down at the shoes, perfume in hand, and began at the right.  First my prom hells, my pumas, my combat/bowling shoe thingys, and then I came to my beloved boots.   I checked the right one, no sign of any unusual smell, but I knew I was getting closer.  Then I saw, on the left one, a small gray ball stuck to the top.  I thought it might just be a dust bunny.  Or maybe my cat threw up on my shoe. Ew, that's it, that's the problem.  So I hold my breath as I pull the shoe out into the light, and then I see it.  What I believed to be a hairball is actually a mouse.  A dead mouse.  My mind flickers back to a vague memory in which my mom told me about a month ago that she saw a mouse in her room, but she never heard from it again. So now, it's a month old, rotting carcas of a mouse, stuck to my boot.  And these are my rocky boots! My knee high vinyl boots! My boots that make me look like a sex goddess!  At this point I stop the Spoiled-City-Girl panic over my ruined boots, and start the Spoiled-City-Girl panic of trying to find someone else to clean up the mess.  My mom, the lovely Farm Girl she is, reluctantly volunteered, not realizing how decomposed this mouse really is.  I'm in the hallway, halfway to fainting, when my mom runs into the kitchen to dispose of the thing.  We washed off my boots with a disgusted look on our faces the whole time, and my closet is now locked in a Febreezed haze until I desperately need to get in there.  Possibly when I start packing for college.  And the clincher:  This terrible stench that surrounded the back of my apartment smelled quite similar to old, rotted cheese.

      So today was part of two weekends in a row that have been the best weekends ever.&nbsp; I went to Marcy's house for her going away/ really fucking early birthday party.&nbsp; I learned a lot, and to impart some of this wisdom onto you, here is a new blogger feature: a list.  &nbsp;    Lauren can make kickass Battleship noises  I have the "village bike" hat  Houm really does want to have sex with Mike Einzinger  Chester doesn't know shit about a lot of music, but he's still cool  If you search "marcy is stupid" on Google Images, you get a single picture of a breast  I have a better job than a lot of people, even though I don't get paid  Team "Dick" can kick the crap out of anyone at scrabble, even when Team "Sexy Biotch" should have had more points for "bleeds"  Marcy doesn't know what "serenity" means  Jeff is short and funny  There is a town called Houma about an hour and a half from New Orleans. ROAD TRIP!  Somehow, it is 200 bucks to take an overnight train to New Orleans, but only 79 to fly there...weird   C  o  l  o  r  s   a  r  e   f  u  n    I like cake   Apparently, I can't describe the place where I lost my hat in London to save my life.&nbsp; To properly do this I'd have to draw a diagram, which I am far too lazy to do  Scaring rocky virgins is also fun  hormones suck   But with all of the celebrating, I'm still feeling a bit...I don't know...fucked up.&nbsp; First there is the scare that my mom might not let me go to Houms party 2 Saturdays from now.&nbsp; But hopefully that can be settled. I mean, I get Fridays and Sundays off too, so I can visit my grandparents then, right?&nbsp; And then, I think today I saw on a map for the first time just how far away New Orleans is. That was kind of scary.&nbsp; But throughout all of this, there is one lesson that I would like everybody to remember:  &nbsp; 17.&nbsp; Listening to Monty Python's "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life" will  ALWAYS  cheer you up.  &nbsp;  P.S.&nbsp; I really miss all of my city friends. If you're around during the week, please call me.&nbsp; Even if we can't hang out a lot, we should at least have dinner or something. I feel like I'm seeing my out of town friends more than I'm seeing you.

      Oh yeah, that's right.&nbsp; This was what I spent my evening doing, in between playing Harry Potter on the computer and watching "I Love The 90's."  &nbsp;  I babysit for this kid, Chandler (and I swear I can't think of his name without imagining  urlLink Frankie's &nbsp;homoerotic fantasies of the late Friends characters) and he is a character in every sense of the word. He sounds like he jumped out of some right-winged paradise.&nbsp; We always get along, and he's always been cool, but I never knew his views until today.&nbsp; We started talking about the election, about Bush and Kerry and ::gasp:: Nader, and when we came to gay marriage he mentioned something about the bible.  &nbsp;  For those of you who don't know my religious views, I'll state them not-so-briefly.&nbsp; I agree with Eddie Izzard in that "religions are not religions. They are philosophies with some good ideas and some fucking weird ones."&nbsp; I always thought of God as kind of an imaginary friend figure.&nbsp; When you're little and have no one to connect with, you come up with an imaginary friend. Someone to keep you company, someone to share your secrets with, someone who makes you confident to go out and face the world.&nbsp; Now (and not to insult any of my religious friends, as I have respect for everyone's ideas) I think there is a time where you can grow out of this.&nbsp; I don't really see the point of spending a majority of your time worrying about a connection with an unknown being when there are 6 billion people in the world, each with something amazing to offer. Why cut yourself off from them?&nbsp; Any time a religion keeps somebody from embracing another person on earth...well...let's just say it's not for me.  &nbsp;  That said, Chandler and I got into about a 2 hour conversation over God.&nbsp; He kept trying to tell me stuff about the Bible and how "if you ever choose a religion, go for Catholic. Don't ever become a Muslim, 'cause they're way too stuck to their religion."&nbsp; Well can't Catholics become pretty stuck too? "No, you don't have to go to church one day of your life and you can still go to heaven."  &nbsp;  Somehow I don't think that's right.  &nbsp;  But the clincher came when the conversation U-turned back to politics.&nbsp; I was talking about Nader and he all of a sudden interrupted me with the latest revelation he had just been informed of.  &nbsp;  "Guess what?!?!? Guess what?!&nbsp; Some politicians, like, to get into office and stuff, like, they will just lie throughout their entire campaign, and once they're in the White House  BAM!  They'll just do whatever they want.&nbsp; Like, they'll completely change their views about stuff."  &nbsp;  Oh God.  &nbsp;  This was so refreshing and yet so heartbreaking at the same time.&nbsp; Here was this kid who could barely fathom the idea that someone would lie just to further their career, and here I thought he was so annoyingly naive to not have known this by the time he was 12.&nbsp; But was this really so bad? When did I become so jaded that lying became just another everyday occurrence?&nbsp; But hey, as I told him, the Catholic church has been doing it for years.  &nbsp;  ZING!

      So today was just like any other day, but with some special perks.  First there was the blind piano tuner. That's right. His name is Tom and he came to tune the new piano over at The Magic Shop today.  It makes sense that he'd be good at it, since he doesn't have to concentrate on seeing. But I found that, once away from the piano he can be quite a charmer.  As an intern, it was my duty to walk him out and find him a cab, and as we did this he proceeded to shower me with complements. He asked if I was a singer, because apparently I have a lovely speaking voice.  When I apologized for not being able to find a cab on time, he said it didn't matter because he got to meet me, and that was a plus.  I just felt so special.  And this guy can't even see me, which is why I think a latter comment confused me so much.  He had to come back because the piano was having issues adjusting to it's new environment, and so I had to find him a cab again.  When walking out I mentioned how much it sucked that the piano didn't tune, and how sorry I was that he was late for his next job, and he said "oh well, but it's always nice seeing you."  Seeing me?  YOU'RE BLIND!  But I guess if I can make someones day brighter it's always good.  So tonight I have officially joined the annoying hipster club by going for drinks and dinner at the famous Soho House.  My mothers dear friend Arabelle (Welsh, she's adoreable) is a member, so we met her and her husband for a round of cocktails (and I was able to drink in public, so I am quite impressed with myself) before dinner, and then her husband left and it was just us girls.  We talked about college and boys and how on her anniversary her husband just toasts and says "well, we made it through another bloody 12 months."  And she got me a Tiffany's necklace for graduating.  I like this graduation thing, I should do it more often.  In other news, I really want to see "Home at the End of the World," but I have the same issue with the title that I did with "Coffee and Cigarettes," in that it sounds extremely arthouse pretentious in a very generic sort of way.  It sounds like something they would make fun of, like in "Ghost World" when they made a point that all the stupid people liked that movie "The Rose That Drank the Moon."  If that movie ever existed in real life, I think I'd shoot it.   So, uh, tired and, uh, "Kavalier And Clay."  I am suddenly not interested in sleeping ever again.

      Instead of explaining why this weekend was quite possibly the most fun time I've had in my life, I've decided to just list all the wonderful things people said that I can remember.  This way, you can experience the hilarity along with me.  And if you were there, and remember anything else that I didn't put down, please comment and remind me.   Jon: Hey, it's 4:20 Jaya: Make a wish!   Lauren mentions something about a diaphram  Rie, Jaya, Sharpie: WHICH ONE? Lauren: Wait, there's more than one?  Rie, Jaya and Sharpie all explain at the same time about the one in your lungs and the one used "down there."  Marcy: Holy Shit! There's one down there?!!?!?!  Jon: Jaya, have you ever seen Colin's penis? Jaya: Unfortunately, yes. Jon: When? Jaya: When he took it out and stuck it in Houm's ear when he was asleep. Houm: YOU TOLD ME THAT NEVER HAPPENED!!   When a few of us are on the roof, it's getting lighter out  Jon: It's like you can see the sun rising over New Jersey Jaya:  (Pointing west)  Uhh...Jon? New Jersey is that way. Jon: YOU EVER HEARD OF WIND, BITCH?   I introduce Boman to my mother  Mom: So Boman, how are you? Boman:  (Carrying a large, green pilates ball)   A little riled up to be honest, but that'll all be fine after I BEAT THEM INTO SUBMISSION!  Boman runs off into the distance, chasing Tracy with the ball   RIM SHOT!

      To explain what I felt like last night, I must first explain the soap opera that has been my Indian family's history.  My grandmother and grandfather (Didu and Baba) are both from India, and moved here in the '60's.  When I was younger I thought their marriage was like a fairytale.  They ignored every tradition in their way when they decided to get married.  They fell in love themselves, so it wasn't arranged like it should have been.  And, my grandmother even  married down a caste .  Women weren't supposed to do that, but they didn't care. They were in love.  So Baba moved to America while Didu stayed in India to raise their two children.  Well, that's not really true.  My dad and his brother were raised by their grandmother.  After a few years Didu joined Baba, who was then in Germany, to keep studying.  And at some point they picked up their kids and moved to New Jersey.  When I was little I remember having visits from this woman I called Chiti.  Her real name was Premela, and she was a "co-worker" of my grandfathers.  Maybe I shouldn't have put co-worker in quotation marks, because she really did work with him at the hospital.  But she was also his mistress.  You can imagine my confusion when I first learned this.  I mean, she got married and our families stayed friends, but for a long time she lived with my dad's family, sleeping in the same bedroom as my grandfather while Didu stayed in the next room.   For a long time I blamed her for my family's problems.  She came into the house and fucked everything up.  I could imagine my fragile grandmother trying to stand up for herself, my grandfather screaming at her and hitting her, and then taking out more of his anger on my dad and uncle.  And anytime my dad used me as a scapegoat, the blame always somehow got back to her.  And then her husband died.  Ok, I don't want to be mean, but I never liked the guy.  He was a pig in every sense of the word.  Every time I walked into their gold-plated-stale-candy-filled-TV-in-every-room-velvet-on-the-walls-white-spraypainted-plants-and-orange-shag-carpeted house he would immediately treat everyone like his inferior.  At restaurants he would snap his fingers and order the waiters around like his slaves, never once saying thank you, and then smushing his food in his puffy, wrinkled mouth with his greasy, knobby fingers.  I couldn't eat around him, and excused myself from his presence on many an occasion.  This man had never worked a day in his life, relied on his wife's career to pay the bills, and yet she stayed with him.  So this man died recently, and I didn't feel a thing.  When my dad told me, I paused for a second, nodded my head with an "oh...Wow," and went back to eating my dinner (but stopped for a second because I had an image of him eating in my head).  I really didn't care, as much as I feel like a bitch to say that.    But last night my dad made me call her.  I haven't seen this woman in maybe two years.  And the last time, I dreaded the occasion.  She never had children so she always tried to act like my mother.  But like, stereotypical frightening mother.  She pinched my cheeks, made me sit on her lap, fed me non-stop until I felt like I would explode, and always called me her "favorite."  I never asked to be a favorite.  But I called her anyway.  She picked up the phone and I said hello, and for a moment she thought I was someone named Alicia.  She had a sadder quality to her voice, almost like she was sighing, not wanting to be bothered with anyone.  After telling her it was me she immediately turned back into the Chiti I had known and feared, but for that moment I seemed to get a glimpse into who she is, beyond what I've created in my own head.  We talked for a while, about college and stuff. She warned me about trouble and told me to have "good, clean fun" (I'm not joking, someone actually used that term in a non-sarcastic way).     By the end of the conversation I was a mess.  I mean, who was this woman?  My whole life I had been raised as if she was family, but did anyone ever sit me down and explain to me where she came from? No.  I had to deduce this all by myself, and only when I confronted someone with the information would they verify it.  She is nothing to me, but I can't get rid of her.  If she was really nothing to me, I could just drop her.  But if I were to do that, my dad would be hurt, my grandparents would be hurt, she would be hurt.  I don't want to hurt her.  I just want to erase her.  And at the end of the conversation she reminded me:  "You know, you're still my favorite."

      But this is an e-mail I just recieved from Sharpie:    Jaya Saxena. You are at work? i am at work. it is boring. See Dick. See Dick  run. Run Dick, run! He runs into Jane. Mini-dick runs into mini-Jane. It is  gay, except it is straight. It is gay in the sense of happy, and straight in  the sense of heterosexual. Yay, gay, yay!  ... elbow sex. elbow sex. ...   Can I say again how much I love my friends?

      ...  ...  Yeah.  Anyone with my sense of humor will be pissing themselves right about...now.  First things first, a happy 17th birthday to  urlLink Sharpie .  She has now joined an elite club of 17-year olds, like me, and Frankie and Tracy.  The Olsen Twins were once a part of this club, but they've moved on to bigger and better things (the fucking coke addicts).  I've been feeling really guilty lately.  No idea why.  My dad calls me, I have a tone of annoyance because he's called during work (and he knows what my hours are), but after I hang up I feel bad.  And I told my mom that I was going to Rocky this friday, which is perfectly fine because I had nothing planned, and she certainly didn't tell me anything, but I sensed that she was a little mad at me.  I think I can read people too well.  It can be a good skill, but a lot of times it can just make me paranoid for longer than I should be.  Ignorance really can be bliss.  Oh yeah, registering for classes has been fun. Especially if your idea of fun is being kicked repeatedly by a person wearing shoes made out of porcupines.  All these classes I want to take are already booked up because Freshmen get the last registering times.  I even have to take off of work early next tuesday so I can get home in time to do this, because I'm not risking having to take even more classes that I'm not too excited about.  The only one like that right now is General Physics 1.  I'm sorry, I do love physics, but I've had about enough for now. But nothing else really fits into my schedule, and I need to get some of these requirements out of the way.  Good news is I think I can take Fundamentals of Music Theory.  A fine arts requirement out of the way  and  something I really want to take. Yay!

      I'm figuring now is as good a time as any to post, since I want to keep tonight for watching  urlLink True Stories .  But as I was rolling around last night, trying to fall asleep but finding my pillow just too unsupported, I began thinking about  urlLink Frankie's  blog, and about her brief mention of a conversation with MMM, and how fucking jealous I am.  I mean I'm really happy for her. It sounds great and I want to hear about it, and it sounds like something that would make her happy, which makes me happy.  But I am always a bit jealous.  Maybe it's a Scorpio thing.  Maybe it's an only child thing.  Maybe I'm used to attention so I crave more.  Maybe that's why I'm so into performing.  But maybe it's because I'm a girl.  Whenever something great happens to one of my girlfriends, I can't be fully happy for them, even if I want nothing to do with what has happened to them.  I don't want to be dating who they are dating, and yet when they confess that they are in love, as happy as I am for them I feel a pang of bitterness.  I was that girl once.  I was in love, and it's over now.  Not to say it'll never happen again, but for now it's over.    And guys never seem to have this problem!  The only time I have ever seen guys get really jealous is when 2 kids from my school fought over a girl at the graduation party.  One took her to prom, the other had just hooked up with her.  But guys can fight.  I wish I could fight.  And guys get it out in the open.  I remember seeing Mean Girls and laughing my ass off, but being a bit nervous because that was how it was.  Not that extreme, with the 3-way calling sabotage, but they were just acting out what every girl wishes they could do.  I also thought of what Choitner was saying in a class this past May, about how the number of "sweet boys" in any given community dictates the tone of the group.  I think it's true.  In any group of my friends, the boys are sweet.  Bucks Rock people, school people, anywhere.  The guys are great.  And so the girls feel no need to compete, because we can have their attention without being slutty and catty and stupid.  Meanwhile, in places where the guys are sex obsessed jerks, girls feel the need to be the slutty, catty things that they can be, because being a nice girl isn't going to get their attention.  Nice girl.  Ugh.  Girls always have to be nice.  Girls are "sugar and spice and everything nice."  That's why we can't fight! That's why we can't get our feelings out in the open! We have to be nice, and fighting isn't nice.  Being honest isn't nice.    Well keeping everything inside isn't nice either, but as I really don't have anything that extreme to voice, I'll be fine for now.

      So I saw Spiderman 2 again, and something is really bothering me.  No, it's not the fact that Kirsten Dunst happens to be wet and braless AGAIN.  It's something that happens in every movie dealing with mind-bogglingly powerful machinery.  You see, in this movie the four arms attached to "Doc Ock" are so powerful that he needs to create a chip to keep them from taking over his body, and when that chip is broken they posses his mind and set out on destroying the city. 'Cause that's what machines do.  Isn't it?  I mean, if you were to create a machine that powerful, a machine that could make it's own sun and blow up 3 million people, wouldn't you make the default setting "attack" and not "sit quietly and wait for further instruction"?  And if we made the latter the default setting, would the machines and their evil minds just override it? And what is so necessary that we need to create these to do that we can't do ourselves?  I realize that I ask a lot more questions than I actually answer, but I think it's interesting. And holy shit they got Ralph Nader on The Daily Show.  How do they do this?  Why would people subject themselves to that? I mean maybe as main guest it's cool, but as one of the side interviews you're just asking for an ass kicking.  Like Don King.  That was the funniest segment I have ever seen.  And poor Ralph Nader.  I feel for him, I really do, but as we know even though  urlLink John Kerry is a Douchebag I'm voting for him anyway .  I need to see more theater. I had promised a friend to see  urlLink Assassins  but I really don't have the cash right now, as I am not getting paid.  And friends of mine are all raving about Caroline or Change and Much Ado About Nothing and Sweeney Todd and everything, and I just feel out of the loop.  My most recent theatrical experience has been Rocky Horror, which is incredible in itself but when people are yelling out their own lines it's kind of hard to follow any real plot.  But I am still going again this Friday, no changing that.   My dad's talking to the cat again, chastising her for not being a dog.  I need to get out of this house.

      Sorry I couldn't come up with a wittier title.  So, you wanna know what I've been up to lately? Do ya? DO YA? I know you do. So here it is. Let me see, after my last post I went to Emily's house, where we chilled and eventually went to a midnight showing of Spiderman 2.  My 2nd midnight movie in 2 days.  It was great, although Rie was right when she said Dunst's falling out of character was annoying to anyone who has been on stage.  But oh well, I like to think that things like that are the directors fault, because you rarely see the director in magazines, henceforth, he does not exist.  After watching Degrassi (my new obsession, and Jake Epstien, I WILL MAKE YOU LOVE ME) we slept, and then I went back for my fourth of July bash!  It wasn't really a bash.  But we watched the fireworks on my roof.  You know, seeing it on TV never did it for me.  You can never fully experience the glory of 35,000 colorful explosions less than half a mile away from you until you see them in person.  And we were even geeky enough to have the New York Post's guide of all the different types.  My personal favorites are the Willow and the Chrisanthymum, but you can decide for yourself.  So today.  After making "truffles" (equal parts cream cheese and powdered sugar with some chocolate powder thrown in) with Sarah Dolan, I headed off to the night shift, deathly afraid the whole way.  Bad things happen to people on the night shift.  No matter where you are, people get killed, ghosts appear, movies staring Ewan McGregor are made (not that he's a bad thing, but I heard it was a shitty movie).  The point is I didn't know what to expect, as I only agreed to do this as a trade to not work next monday.  But it was great!  I walked in the studio and was greeted by "$100 Amp" Matt, who I am now renaming "Unbearably Sexy" Matt.  Jesus Christ in a chicken bucket...  Anyway, he sat me down in a big chair in front of all the controllers and told me to watch this little tuner.  So I did. I watched it with my hearts content.  And soon enough the little hand went up after he played around with some dials.  After helping with that for an hour, I went out and read, got laughed at by Tracy when I answered the phone, and around 9:30 noticed that everybody was leaving.  But Matt came out and told me to stay, as he had been fucking around with some control box for the past 4 hours and needed to do the control watchy thing again.  So it was me and him. Alone.  In a room.  Shit.  So we started talking.  We talked about college. How he stayed in for 3 and a half years and then dropped out his last semester.  How he had just spent the 4th of July weekend in Florida with his mother and his girlfriend (fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck), how I was excited about college, how I knew tracy, music, engineering, just good stuff.  And then he put on The Breeders CD after I had complained about having "Jesse's Girl" by Rick Springfield stuck in my head. (I wasn't really upset about it.  I am actually in love with the song, I think it's the best produced record I have heard. I just wanted something to say).  And he got really excited to play me their cover of "Happiness is a Warm Gun," my favorite Beatles song.    Around 10:45 we packed up and left.  He started coughing a lot, and made some sarcastic joke that he was a "sexy sexy man." I did everything in my power not to scream "YES YOU ARE!" and pin him down on the couch, but I, also sarcasitally, replied "yeah, right after coughing up your lung."  Oh...I'm cool.   So I'm sorry if you've been displeased with the general account of what I've done, and not some philosophic romp through the depths of my mind.  I'll do that next time.

      My night began somewhat like that.  It actually began when I was innocently sitting in front of my computer, downloading the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme song, when an IM popped up on my screen.    "oy! Saxena. You rockying tonight?"  I hadn't thought about it, but since I hadn't been in so long, I felt it was my patriotic duty to attend this lovely 4th of July weekend.  So I waited until my dad came home, had dinner, got all prettied up and went out on the town.  I met Sharpie outside of her work on 28th and 7th.  I'll admit I was a bit scared.  The streets were almost bare except for a few of the sleazy types, who kept eyeing me in my satin and lace shirt and hot-pink knee highs.  But we met up all the same and, having about 4 hours to kill, went to Union Square.  After buying "True Stories" (a movie by David Byrne) and some ice cream, we headed over to Tracy's house, meeting up along the way with Harry.  Tracy and Evan (our virgin for the night) were already there.  Tracy and I proceeded to try on many a costume, and I ended up with a new black, tight, cleavage-y shirt. Sweet deal.  I have to say, even though Rie wasn't there, I think this was the best time out of my...Oh crap...I've lost count by now.  I don't know, it just seemed like this was the time I most connected with the cast.  I am a regular indulger of the rocky, but I usually can't afford to go every time my friends go, so it always seems that I miss out on crucial bonding moments.  Not this time.  Hugs from Mark and Brent set the evening off with a good tone.  Feeling loved is always nice.  And we met a new kid, Josh. Well, not new, he has been there a lot, but new to us as we had never been formally introduced.  We went inside, the music started, and it was heaven.  And dude! This kid Josh knows how to swing dance! I have never met another person, let alone a guy, who knows how to swing dance! And he does it well!  Also, last night marked the glorious return of the "Bohemian Rhapsody" medley, even if it was in the absence of a certain Chuck Naked.  I think the most interesting part of the night came during the Brad/Janet deflowering scenes.  Mad Man Mike lay down in the row of seats in front of us, to rest himself until he made Rocky take it up the ass.  I was sitting on the edge, and he turned his head towards me and we started talking.  And then he actually introduced himself to me.  It never occurred to me that we didn't really know each other.  Well, I knew him, but he knew me merely as another prostitot.  We shook hands, and he informed me that if I ever threw my bra on stage again he was keeping it. (Oh right, that little escapade was fun, I threw my bra onstage during "Sweet Transvestite," he picked it up, and wore it for a while as a lovely headband before snapping it back to me.)  So after Mark scared the crap out of me by sneaking up on me, and after exchanging e-mails and meeting another Boondock Saints enthusiast, Tracy and I headed home, ate pudding, watched Sweet Home Alabama, and went to bed.  But not actually sleeping until about 5:30 in the morning, we had some pretty weird conversations. I won't divulge their contents, except to say TRIANGLE!  So now I'm home, savoring the memory of the night before and anticipating the one I will have next Friday, where I will definitely make it to the diner if I am invited.  I just want to savor each one of these visits before I have to go, because I am positive the New Orleans cast has nothing on these guys.

      Ok, so it's looking like nothing much is going to happen to me today. I'm just here updating my iTunes at my dads house, listening to The Police.  So I've decided to divulge a strange little rant that I've had going in my head for a while.  A rant about the Mom and Pop condom companies.  Whenever I go to the deli, I always find myself obviously staring at the condoms that hang in the rack overhead, next to the batteries and the "Horny Goat Weed" pills.  There are always a variety of condoms there, from the well known brands to some lesser known ones. And what puzzles me is, does anyone actually buy the smaller brand condoms?  I mean sure, we all know  urlLink Trojan  has been America's #1 condom, trusted for over 80 years, and people use  urlLink Durex  and maybe even  urlLink Lifestyles  all the time.  But does anyone ever buy  urlLink Atlas  condoms?   urlLink Caution ?  urlLink Kimono ?   I have a dilemma here.  Living in New York, with brand names all around me.  I could get Starbucks coffee, Domino's pizza or Blockbuster movies over any corner store stuff any time I want.  But always rooting for the underdog, I often go out of my way to support the little guy.  I'll get pizza at the small place on the corner of St. Marks place, my coffee at Cafe Pick Me Up, and my movies at that Korean place a few blocks away.  And with some of my punk rock ethics, I take great pride in this. Fuck the big guy! Fuck the system!   But with condoms it's a different story.  If no one has become pregnant using Trojan condoms for 80 years, fuck it, I'm using Trojan.  There's something larger at stake here.  I might get the satisfaction of helping out a growing company if I use a no-name brand, but I might also get Chlamydia.  How does one even break into the condom industry anyway? Is it someone's childhood dream to artistically shape latex into phallic forms?  If I don't help them out, will their dreams be crushed?  Will they throw in the lube and quit, forced to take some temp job, while they pine away for the magical metallic parts of the condom factory?  Would that all be my fault?  Maybe, but I'd rather not get Chlamydia.

      Wow, it feels like I haven't posted in a while. Sorry if I've kept you waiting.   Holy shit!! I just came back from seeing  urlLink Monty's Fan Club  CBGB's.  For those of you who don't know my association with them, here's the skinny.  I met them when they played at my friend Ross's house about a month back.  He had won a contest on their website, but he already knew them.  So it was the 5 band members, me, Emily K, Ross, Houm, Ross's friend Chloe and Ross's parents.  And it kicked ass!  We had burgers and birthday cake and it was great.  This was their first time playing in the city for a year, and wow, it just...I can't...you know that amazingly elated feeling you get sometimes after you've been a part of something great, and you just can't think straight? That's what I have right now.    I walked up to CBGB's, alone as none of my friends could come, nervous as hell that they wouldn't remember me.  But they did!  Ryan's (the trumpeting twin) eyes opened wide as we bumped into each other while I tried to go through the door.  "Hey! Aww man, thanks for coming out.  I don't think the doors are open yet."  It sounds normal, but it just made me feel amazing.  Then I spotted Steve, mohawk proudly raised high above his head, and still wearing Emily's bracelets.  He didn't see me, but Mama Andrew did!  I got a hug from him and another thanks for being there.  So the doors opened and I walked inside, seeing Justin (the drumming twin) setting up onstage.  Then I passes Ryan again, and he pulled me aside and we started talking. He had to run to set up, but once again he thanked me for coming out. They're such nice boys...  And the show! Oh, oh the show! They were opening for all these shitty death metal bands, which is weird because they sound nothing like that.  Ok, so they covered a Bon Jovi song...but that's it!  And stupid CB's had pulled out all the tables because they didn't think MFC could get anyone moving, but they showed them!  We sang along and jumped and clapped and...I'm sorry...I just remember this one moment, where Steve all of a sudden remembered who I was.  He was doing the usual talk in between songs, explaining they were from Rhode Island and stuff, when he looked down and saw me right in front.  He kind of cocked his head to one side and pointed. I pointed back. He gave a thumbs up, and so did I.  That was all I needed.    So they finished and I started talking to this girl Lillian, but not before Steve gave me a high five.  I hung out for a while, said hi to their bassist (and I still can't remember what his name is...sorry!), high fived Justin, bought a CD and then ran into Andrew again.  We talked for a bit and he just said "thanks so much for coming and for being in front there.  It really made us feel good having you. Are you gonna be hanging around for a while?" ::nods:: "Good, so am I, I'll see you around."  And I died.  So the metal was getting a bit much for me, so I decided to leave. Funny thing was everyone was hanging outside.  I guess the metal got too much for them too. So all of a sudden I run into Ryan, and he asked me if I had seen his brother.  I said no, and he asked if I was leaving.  I said yes and he told me to hold on and wait outside, so he could say goodbye.  So I did, said goodbye to the bassist, and then went to Steve to say goodbye. I got a big sweaty hug and a reminder to talk to them after Warped Tour.  I got another hug from Ryan and a happy "See you in Randall's Island!"  I then got a final hug from Andrew and a promise to talk at their next show.   I haven't felt this good in ages.

      He wanted everyone around him. I jumped to where he was. The music was The Stooges. They played "Real Cool Time." There were people dancing everywhere, and he was going crazy. He was the popular one, everyone wanted to be around him. I danced like there was no tomorrow. That cool go-go move that I always do. He turned around and saw me. He smiled after drinking half of his Aquafina water, and then handed me the bottle. It was like the seas parted when he saw me. I still have the bottle. We went our ways. When they played "No Fun" he put his hand on my shoulder and we sang the chorus. Our faces were closer than natural. The rest of the show I watched in admiration from the side, speakers blaring in my ear.  The setting- Randall's Island, on stage in front of about 16,000 people  The man- Iggy Pop

      That lyric was just in my head.  Right now I'm at my grandparents house, and for some reason there is this high pitched frequency resonating all around the living room, and we can't figure out where it's coming from, even after turning everything off, and it's DRIVING ME INSANE.  Anyway, yesterday I was looking through  New York  magazine, reading about Joel Steinberg's meth-clinic time and the premier of  Garden State,  when I flipped back to the personals section. Personals have always intrigued me, because most of the time people are forced to describe themselves and what they want in this ridiculous shorthand and, most likely, sit in their homes expecting perfect results. There's this song by the Vandals called "SWM" in which the lead singer helplessly coaxes any prospective date with the idea that "we can meet for coffee, or go to the state fair, I don't even like to do thoes things but I'm gettin' kinda desperate here so call me!" You never really know who you're going to find out there. Also, I like matching up people I read about. I once circled and connected in bright red two ads inside the  Village Voice.  One "SINGLE BLACK WOMAN 49 SEEKS MALE 45-55 DRUG AND DRINKING FREE ITALIAN OR GERMAN PREF." with "ITALIAN MALE 50'S SEEKS HOT BLACK WOMAN FOR MUTUAL FUN." I think it was made in heaven, I just hope they find each other.  Anyway, so I flipped to the personals of  New York , where the selection is smaller but much more detailed. Here the people get to answer questions such as "What's the best or worst lie you've ever told?", "Describe your room" and "What's your favorite on-screen sex scene?" As I was looking towards the men's side, I come across a code name of "joe_z" and upon further inspection of the teacher I found this man was my high school math teacher, one Joseph Zipoli. This was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. In his black and white photo he is winking at the camera, with his Elvis-combed hair shining in the sun. He describes himself as a "Mathematics Instructor" (I like the elaboration of the fact that he just controls snot-nosed rich, annoyingly liberal New York City private school kids for 45 minutes at a time.) His most humbling moment was cooking a bad meal for a friend, the worst lie he ever told was "I understand noncommunative algebras", and you should call him if "you enjoy being taken care of"...or something like that.  It made me a bit sad. No, not sad. Emo kids are sad. Sad people write bad poetry. I don't even write poetry. Ok, I write songs, but with full intention of there eventually being music behind those lyrics, so it doesn't count. It made me upset. Sure, Joe's a character. He gets a cow delivered to his farm once a year, and cuts it up for meat himself. He biked across the united states once. He got an Indian percussionist to perform for us once (an odd obsession for Indian music). He opened an IRA at age 15, drives a truck, doesn't have a computer or a TV and will forwardly inform students that they will get married someday. But we love him! And when (after describing a failed blind date to us once) he jokingly said "I don't have girlfriends! I have math!" it made me upset that someone as cool as Joe is incapable of finding a good girl, and Donald Trump just married a 20 something model.  So, if you're in the market for a 38 year old "Mathematics Instructor" please give Joe a call.  I also discovered that I have a certain fondness for songs about broken, depressed women.  "She's Gonna Break Soon" by Less Than Jake, "Saying Goodbye" by Sugarcult, "She Will Be Loved " by Maroon 5,  "Ballad of Carol Lynn" by Whiskeytown.  My grandmother is kicking me off the computer, so I can't really elaborate, but I don't know what draws me to these.  Maybe it's just the hope that someday, I'll stick out so much in an artists mind (like these women did, but hopefully in not such a depressing way) so that someone will write a song about me.  That's my dream.  And by God, if I can get it once, I can get it again.

      You know you're having a good day when you get major MAJOR eye contact and a really REALLY sexy little smile from a really REALLY hot guy who was LOOKING AT YOU FIRST. Especially when it's the kind of eye contact that makes you both slow down as you're walking past each other, and kind of tilt your heads back when you're out of sight.  Especially when you know he's thinking about having sex with you after you've passed. Especially when you're thinking about having sex with him after you've passed, even though your mother is talking to you. Especially when you just got a new haircut.  Especially when, three blocks later, you still have butterflies, not in your stomach, but in your chest.  Goddamn I'm hot.

      Just for the record, The Village is A MINDFUCK!  So I was just in my room, originally in my pajamas (a.k.a. my Bad Religion shirt), starting to pack for college. I'm getting as many clothes and CD's and stuff as I can from my dad's over to my mom's so I have one place to sort through all this shit. So I was folding shirts and putting them in this huge duffel bag, when I look down and realize I'm not wearing a shirt anymore. I was standing naked in my bedroom, folding clothes, and I had no recollection of taking off my shirt.  This does happen to me a lot, but never when I've been awake. I've woken up many mornings (as most of my friends know by now) to find I am not wearing any pants, and have no memory of taking them off in the night. I used to attribute it  (very jokingly) to someone attempting to rape me in the night, or that my dreams were just so raunchy that I began acting them out (which sometimes they were.)  However, waking up naked is slightly more understandable, because I very well could have risen in almost a sleep-walking way, taken off my pants, and gone back to sleep. But it's still weird when I wake up in the morning.  But not remembering taking off your clothes when you're perfectly conscious? Isn't that a little weird? And by the time I was finished with this thought, I was wearing a bra and a skirt. Maybe I'm thinking too hard, so it blocks any other memories from being registered in my head. Or maybe my brain thinks that getting dressed isn't that special of a memory to be worth remembering. Is my attention span too short?  And looking down now, I am still just wearing a bra and a skirt. What the fuck? Excuse me while I find a shirt.

      I've been getting a lot of advice about going away, as I'm sure everyone who has ever gone to college did before they left. I don't really mind it. I know that everyone means well, even though I seem to have heard it all before. It's kind of funny how I know what's going on, even though I've never been through this before.  But I've been getting more nervous about college lately. I'm fine with classes and moving away, but it's coming back that I'm afraid of. Everyone has been telling me that college is this big change, and I'm fine with most changes, but there is this looming idea that I am going to change. I don't want that. Surprising as it may sound coming from a teenage girl, I really like who I am. I'm comfortable and confident in myself, I like the decisions I've made and the people I surround myself with. I don't want to go to college and have that all change. I don't want to come back over Christmas vacation having alienated myself from all of my old friends. I don't want to be egotistical about all of my new college experiences and make them feel naive because they haven't seen what I've seen. I don't want to start viewing people in terms of whether they're in college or still in high school, or look down on them because they're young. I want to make new friends, but I don't want to forget anyone.  But then again, if I am as confident in myself as I know I am, I won't do stupid stuff like that.  I've also been getting a shitload of horror stories about New Orleans. My dad's boss relayed a story onto me about his girlfriend. Basically, there's the southern Mafia down there, who don't take kindly to anyone too outspoken. There have been reports of them paying off bartenders, and upon a mobsters signal, the barkeep will roofie a girls drink. This is what happened to my boss's girlfriend, and she and her friend ended up being taken on a boat ride with the mob guy, and held out in the bayou for three days. Also, having just bought a Bad Religion shirt, complete with a "NO" sign over the cross, I don't really know how I'm going to do.  Basically, if you're ever with me in New Orleans, don't let me go to a bar alone.

      Holy shit. Warped Tour. There are words, I'm not going to say "there are no words" because obviously, if I'm posting about this, there are fucking words.  We [e, Sharpie, Emily K and her beau Steven (Steven? Stephen? I don't know)] show up at Randall's Island at around noon, to briefly run into Travis and then to find Emily and Kiri on line. We wait with them for about an hour, after running into Angel as well, and with minor difficulty (they fucking took away the blondies I baked for Monty's Fan Club...yes...I baked blondies...I am turning into my mother...AHHHH!!!) But after wandering around for a bit we found MFC's tent. Ryan was there and recognized us, and gave me and Emily hugs. When I explained to him the blondies debacle, he all of a sudden got this sympathetic look on his face and said "Aww man! That was so nice of you! Oh man, I should have given you my cell phone number, I could have come met you and taken them." Aww yeah.  Anyway, first up on the list of people to see was Flogging Molly. I went into the pit (woot!) and crowdsurfed to "Rebels of the Sacred Heart" and "Devil's Dance Floor." I learned that if you're a girl, people won't fuck with you in the pit. Steven went in and got into a fucking fight with someone, got punched in the jaw and everything, and I walked out after an entire set with a little scratch on my elbow.  We wandered around more, stumbled onto Washington Social Club, and saw The Bouncing Souls. I met them once on a boat, nice guys. Fucking awesome set. Crowdsurfed to "Born Free" and sang my ass off to "True Believers." So afterwards we got funnel cake, and (as is tradition) got into a powdered sugar fight. We looked like coke addicts with A.D.D. by the end, but it was worth it, because when I used my bandana as a mouth-cover so I could breathe in the dust-stormed pits, my breath briefly tasted of sugar.  MFC up next. Amazing, as always, and when they did "Livin' on a Prayer," Ryan sang the whole "Doesn't make a difference if we make it or not / We got each other and that's a lot" part right to me. We jumped, we danced, we made the whole audience aware that we were already friends with them. It felt good. I talked to Ryan and Andrew afterwards too...good times.  Ran off from that to Bad Religion. Ahhh!! I know after every show I go to now I say that, but this is really true. Amazing. Inspiring. I admire Greg Graffin so much. "American Jesus," "Epiphany," and "You Are (The Government)." They ended with "Sorrow", and after soaring above the crowd to that one I landed right in front of Jay Bentley, and for a brief moment we looked at each other and...ahh! Oh god I'm a dork but I don't give a fuck.  And NOFX. Opened with "Heart and Soul," played "Drugs are Good," "Bob" and "Idiot Son of an Asshole." Crowdsurfed to that one. Got one of Fat Mikes picks. Chants of "ONE MORE SONG!" and "FUCK YELLOWCARD!" filled the air, and it was a perfect end to the day.  Oddly enough, I ran into this kid Andrew who I met at the Tulane alumni dinner. He's cool. And Shoshana too. I haven't seen her in too long. Anyway, people of every age loved it, so fuck those elitist pricks who think that show's aren't enjoyable when young or old people are there. Everyone just kind of came together for the whole thing and made it great.   And I can proudly say that this was the first concert that I have been too where I actually lost my voice by the end.  And that's saying a lot.  I've been to 66 concerts now (I keep a list...DORKINATION!) and this is the first time I haven't been able to speak well.  But it was worth it.  If only they didn't take my fucking blondies...

       Hangin' in the underground Before a train back out of town Away from you All the lights that disappear In the tunnels way down here It's quite a view  Sometimes I wish I were deaf Then I wouldn't hear the words you say Under your breath Under your breath  Locked away in your room On the phone with someone who She thinks out loud Thought she found the right to leave Think of the things you used to need And I'd run out  Sometimes I wish I were deaf But I hear the words you say Under your breath Under your breath  Anything that you put on me All the things your head needs, You believe Read my mind 'Cause I can't say anything The sick heart potion Two parts pain One part true again  Sometimes I wish I were deaf But I hear the words you say Under your breath Under your breath    -Whiskeytown   Sometimes, there are songs that just get you. They kill you. No matter what you're doing they stop you dead in your tracks and make you pay attention. This is one of those songs for me. I know it loses impact when you take the music out, but it's the best I can do. I think I just wanted to share that.

      So much blog, so little time. That lovely quote was from The Frogs, which I saw last night with Willa. Amazing. Utterly amazing. Nathan Lane, George Bernard Shaw and the gay guy from The Stepford Wives are a recipie for comedy. Funny though, I expected more political commentary. Whatever ratting there was on the Bush administration was rather subtle. But I like it that way. It makes it more timeless. And who should I run into at the show but Rie! Apparently she got a ticket on student rush, so after the show we walked from Lincoln Center to Union Square. I should say something like "I can't remember the last time I did that." but the truth is I can. But it was long enough ago that it could warrant my saying that I don't.  You know, busses have always been weird places (stick with me people this story is going somewhere). As with any mode of public transportation, there are state-mandated rules. No spitting, no food, no drink, stand behind the white line, exit out the back door, blah blah blah. But there are some natural rules that any city kid knows by now, and also makes fun of tourists for not following. Don't sit next to anyone if you can help it, don't play your headphones too loud, don't talk on your cell phone for too long, and most importantly, DON'T TALK TO ANYONE ON THE BUS. If you do, there will be dire consequences, like what happened on the southbound M15 on monday morning.  I was sitting. Not next to anyone but sort of adjacent from this 50 something year old woman. Tousled, badly dyed black hair thrown up in a messy bun, black eyeliner carelessly strewn across bluish-grey eyes, a black tank top with red cherries doing not so good of a job concealing multiple rolls where her stomach should be...you get the point. Sitting across from her was a bald, black man wearing sunglasses and a grey t-shirt with the word "FLORIDA" printed obnoxiously across the front in maroon. I can't tell how it started as I was listening to the new Hives album, but all of a sudden I heard:  "Drugs and violence are all you people know!"  What?  I'm guessing out of nowhere, because this man didn't seem like the kind of guy to provoke unwanted anger, this woman started telling off this black man. She started going on about how he was a drug addict, and an alcoholic, and in a gang and had a gun and when he tried to tell her off, she just replied with a vague "trace my blood there ain't a drug in it." Then, this other black man with a cane started talking to her and shaking his cane in her direction. She immediately took this as an insult and in a Dennis-from-Monty-Python-and-The-Holy-Grail sort of way she started yelling "Look! You see that! Violence! Right there! You're shaking your cane at me, that's violence! I bet you're a drug addict too!"  At this point, the rest of the bus (who seemed schooled in the natural rules of public transportation) began to try to shut this bitch up. In the midst of many would-you-be-quiet's and just-settle-down's I said rather loudly "just do everybody here a favor at get out of New York"...but I don't think she heard me.  I don't know, but that whole event just sort of rattled me. I always thought that New York was such a diverse place. That, because we had every single type of person here, it was impossible to hold these kinds of opinions because you would have to be in contact with people you hated every single day. But, since we do have every type here, I guess we have types like her too.  In other news, Moby recorded at the studio today. He was really nice, and by nice I mean actually said "hi" and "thank you" to me. This is bigger than you think, because I am a slave (ahem...intern). People don't have to say stuff like this, but when they do, it makes the day nicer.

      Sometimes I really do love my job.  Anyway, after sitting for 4 hours by myself, reading, holding down the fort, I was finally allowed to leave after the changing of the guard. I walked up to Union Square (quite a long way from Crosby and Spring, but I felt up to it, and I wanted to delay coming home as much as possible) and perused...no, not perused. Contrary to popular belief, to "peruse" is " urlLink to read or examine with great care ", and I did not do that. I...skimmed, yes skimmed, I like that word. I skimmed through the CD's and ended up buying one, which always makes me happy. It's one of the few things I have that can cheer me up no matter what.  So while sitting on the 6 train I hear an announcement over Ryan Adams that said that we would be going straight from 59th street to 86th. As the rest of the passengers groaned or madly scrambled for the door, I felt a bit excited. I used to live on 89th street, so that was my old neighborhood. Up until I was about 13 I got really excited to go over around 86th and 3rd, where the big shopping area was. Unfortunately, after moving to the East Village and becoming too cool for that area, I haven't been there in a while. But I missed it. I was sort of brutally ripped from my 89th street home one summer while I was at camp (and oddly enough, driving back there a few weekends ago, my mom finally explained why it happened so hastily...Thanks a lot non-tax-or-child-support-paying-deadbeat Dad.) I was calling home one afternoon when my mom informed me that she was moving to a one bedroom on 62nd street in 3 days, so my life on the upper east side was through.  So yeah, I was excited about seeing the old place.  But, to my dismay, I walked out of the southeast corner exit to find the Comfort Diner in shambles. The windows were boarded up, the neon lady carrying the tray of hot turkey was shut off, and there were vague, dusty shadows where "Open 24 Hours" used to be. Looking across the street, I realized that there was a Duane Reade where a movie theater used to be, the theater where I saw "A Goofy Movie" and "Fern Gully." The Children's Place had expanded to where the used to sell cell phones, The Paper House closed, and the drug store across the street from Deborah's house was empty.  I probably shouldn't feel bad. After all, I am too cool for the upper east side. But that doesn't give it a right to change without my permission. Neighborhoods can't be spiteful! But after nearly a mile walk home, I feel fine.  Well not really. Let's just say that I'll  really  be happy when I never have to live with my father again. And as Sylvia Plath put it:  "Daddy, Daddy, you bastard, I'm through."

      So this weekend I learned many things...again. Thank God I now know the complete rules of calling shotgun, that 151 proof alcohol is a bad thing (at least for me), that Dance Dance Revolution can get extremely irritating after hearing Kylie Minogue blaring from the basement at 3 in the morning, that a 1970 Pontiac GTO is never a good enough car, that it is possible to have 1.2 days worth of Incubus on your computer and still want to order their "Live From Malaysia" album, braiding hair doesn't work without thousands of tiny rubber bands, and that apparently girls are the only ones who can put chicken wings in an oven.  I should really stop hanging out with boys all the time.  That's such a lie.  I am also grateful for a minor sexual/friendship-al/whatever-al revelation that I was gently pushed into, but that I had been very much ready to have for way too long.  I have to stop procrastinating on these things.  Rie's chair is sticking in my back. This is really annoying.  So yeah...um...I'm hungry? I have a pretty drawing from the afformentioned owner of the annoying chair, and a desperate need for sleep.  I'm enjoying the "return" key today.  W h e e e ! ! !  Wow I'm silly.
