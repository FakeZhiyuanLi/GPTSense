       On Thursday, before the party, I went to renew my driver's license.  It took precisely 7 minutes.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The party was quite a success and most enjoyable for all, I hope.  Floating behind the wildly enthusiastic and multifarious games were the Beatles, courteously provided for almost the entire duration by  urlLink Seth , his IPod and his IPod-casette converter.  The general ambience was bright and lively, and along with pizza and a variety of snacks provided by both guests and hosts, good talk was the main course, reminiscences and prognostications alike.    Late-breaking news: Ronald Reagan died today at age 93, the longest-lived United States President, and arguably among the most successful and popular.  Farewell.  Also, I took the SAT I for the first time today, and I came out feeling reasonably confident in meeting my goal: 1500+.  Fortunately, unlike the AP exams, results come back promptly, so I won't have to wonder for long!  My system of not studying, going to sleep late~ish and not eating much breakfast pays dividends yet again.  On the health front, over the last few days the pinched nerve issue in my neck has broadened to a general back and shoulder ache (probably from sleeping awkwardly to prevent the neck pain) which has been combated by large doses of Ibuprofen.  I hope that tonight's Ultimate Frisbee'ing will loosen my muscles and palliate the symptoms.  I'll take some pills just in case.

       Ultimate Frisbee at Brother's Pond Park was quite fun yesterday evening, and an excellent use of two hours.  Unfortunately, I wrenched my neck pretty badly on the final point and the pain went from bad to worse, so after popping a pair of ibuprofen tablets I went to sleep -- rather early: 2230 -- in an uncomfortable position.  This morning, I have better range of motion, but the pain is persisting.  I will be distinctly dismayed if this lasts through this evening's events.  I haven't been up this early in several weeks, not since AP exams as a matter of fact, but at least I won't have to adjust my sleep cycle for Saturday's SAT I: The Day After Tomorrow!  Now I intend to read a bit of this rhetorical grammar text my mother used for a class a few semesters ago.  It looks quite interesting and perhaps useful as well; my writing style is entirely intuitive, but some formal rhetorical training wouldn't be amiss.  More later.

       Well, I stayed up until 0600 reading  Out of the Darkness .  The book was the end of the series, and the last 200 pages was a gripping denouement.  Unfortunately, I only intended to read a little before nodding off, so my plan failed rather miserably.  Fortunately, it is summertime.    I've also come to the realization that the pool will likely be undoable for  le soirée  as it is rather small and rather crowded in the evening.  We have things planned for the indoors as well,  mais il aurait été utile d'avoir la piscine .     Book of the Moment:   The Hilbert Challenge , Jeremy Gray

       It's Tuesday already of the first week of summer.  Time always seems to pass quickly in this phase of the season.  The party's on Thursday and I haven't done anything much for it, except invite people and get the food situation sorted out.  I should think more about it today.    I picked up der Trompete and realized (again) how simply awful the instrument is.  It's old and banged up, and the too-small mouthpiece is fused to the pipe.  Since I don't play formally any more, there's no sense in getting a new instrument until I get serious about playing again which I hope to someday.  Still, despite all this, when I picked the hunk of brass today and played that clean, cold note, it felt good.  I don't do warmups any more; I just play strains of things that pop into my head, nothing improvisational, just songs and tunes I've heard or played myself in years past.    But it was different today: I don't know much about how my fellow brass instrument players have experienced this, but some days are just good days.  Your embouchure is perfect, your tone is crystal, and the sound is magical.  It's an almost indescribable sensation -- I don't know why it's so different from any other circumstance -- but it's as though you are almost singing through the instrument, exultant melodic bright tones.  I don't play as much as I'd like, but for four years,  this  was one of the most important things to me.  I'm glad I've decided to pick it up once in a while.  Except for endurance (building that back would take a long stretch of serious playing) I'm glad I'm almost as good as I once was, and possibly better on purely technical matters.  Anyway, I went and got a haircut so, as proscribed by my mother, I look presentable enough to have my license renewed (tomorrow).  I needed one anyway, and it didn't take long.  I'm back at home and back to lazing around.     Book of the Moment:   Vergil's Aeneid , Barbara Weiden Boyd

       I am swinging into summer mode in grand fashion.  There's a delightful euphoria that always seems to follow the first few school-free/stress-free weeks.  The other holidays are much too short and usually too filled to experience the same quality of sensation.  It's almost like simmering in a tub after a very very long and tiring day.    Nonetheless, the past weekend was eventful.  First attending graduation with  urlLink Patrick Steck  & co., seeing friends and acquaintances from these years past go through the motions and cross the stage, their names announced into the clapping and cheering crowd, and the inescapable expectation of my own imminent departure from this phase of life.  I have just a year left of high school, now, and I have a strong feeling that next year will be my finest.  I don't have as much worry going in as I've had in the last few years, but I'd like to think that that's because I'm a happier person in general.  Then attending a rather large and boisterous graduation party hosted by some friends, seeing some old faces again and finding myself comfortable in the crowd.  I enjoyed myself, then drifted off.  In between all the fracas, I've been reading, an activity I don't find enough time for during the school year, or at least not as much as I would like.  I've also been working on this website as I can, but I usually end up with more ideas than energy to see it all through.  It's turning out nicely, though, given it's somewhat temporary design framework and young age.  I have a more aesthetic design in the works, and we'll see how soon I can implement it.    On the homefront, my aunt and uncle have departed after their fortnight-long visit, returning to San Diego and my cousin's home.  I'm actually quite all right with the disruption that guests inevitably bring to a house, despite being quite fond of tranquil surroundings at home.  I manage to balance entertaining with my usual routines, giving both the guests and myself enough space to survive the encounter.  It's easier when it's family, of course.  The house is all-too-empty these days, with my mother a full-time student, my sister studying abroad, and my father only home on weekends from his work in DC.  I don't mind much since I'm used to it, and now being able to drive, I can get out more myself.    That reminds me to renew my license tomorrow.  At least it's summer, eh?

       I resisted the evils of the internet for a few days.  I am proud of my will-power, sad though the situation may seem.  Meantime, things have continued much the same as before.  I've played bridge several times, twice at Coffee Station, and of course, Ultimate Frisbee:  my neck is finally feeling better, and for the first time in the six or seven times I've played, my team has won.    I've been reading into the night more, which is rather unfortunate -- waking up in the mid-afternoon is a waste of useful time, a belief contrary to that which I held  last  summer.  The book of the moment, which I just finished, cost me precisely $2.15 (including tax) at Hastings!  I ran across a lone copy of the hardback edition when I went to drop off some videos we had rented, and it apparently was the last in stock or something like that.  I've wanted to get it for some time, but the hardback printing was rather limited in 2000 and the price exorbitant, so I decided to wait for the paperback.  I think the retail price is $27.  ~more later~   Book of the Moment:   Scion of Cyador , LE Modesitt, Jr.

       Other than an excellent bridge game with Dimitar, his father, and Nathan, the last of whom who was my partner, I have been doing little in the last few days.  I have resolved to change this tomorrow by doodling to Evans Library (?) after filling the air in my car and going through some material on a few number theory issues I'm interested in.  I'll be well armed with the biblographical section of my mathematical books.    I do feel good that I've been able to do a lot of reading so far this summer, and I have a pile of stuff to digest yet.  I want to do some writing as well, though, something else I want to explore in the next few carefree weeks.  I have several ideas in mind; look for firsthand manuscripts here once I get down to the work.  ~more later~   Book of the Moment:   The Cartoon Guide to Physics , Larry Gonick & Art Huffman

       I came up with something of a mathematical problem while doodling about:  ----------- Find a continuous function f(x) for which f(1) = 0, f(i) = pi, and f(e) = 2/e.*    * i = sqrt(-1) = 1 /_ 90; pi = C/d = 3.14159.. ; e = lim[n-->inf] (1+1/n)^n = 2.71828..  It's actually relatively simple.  A prize may be involved! -----------  Also, I've been invited to join a team for the Oracle-sponsored  urlLink ThinkQuest  competition and I've accepted.

       Well, I put in some significant work the last 2 nights/early mornings and finished an  urlLink article  about Pascal's Triangle for the website.  First, I did some research to bolster my own work, then I wrote the article itself as a document, rewrote and edited it, converted it to HTML (a long process), made all the necessary changes to the website, and spent some time making it view somewhat normally in that abysmally idiotic browser known as Internet Explorer, about 8 hours of work in all.  I think I accomplished my aims.    AP scores are now available by phone, apparently.  Tempting..   Book of the Moment:   Game, Set and Math , Ian Stewart

       ~I've had lots of blog-worthy things to say lately, but I've been unable or unwilling to share.~    ~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-= My occasional bouts of insomnia irritate me quite a bit, and sometimes I just give up which exacerbates things.  Fortunately, I'm aware of my biochronometrics well enough to ameliorate the situation easily enough during the holidays.  The trick for me is staying up as long as I can without succumbing to exhaustion (sometime in the early afternoon the next day, usually), then sleeping 8 hours or so, waking up for a short time still feeling relatively tired, and going to sleep in the early morning to wake up in the mid-morning or afternoon of the following day.  It's a quick fix to a situation that could potentially throw me off for weeks.  I need my sleep more than most people with whom I've discussed the matter, at least 8 hours a day, and 12 when I can get it.  ~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-= On a more amusing note, my family was the victim of a snail-mail scam, one of many variants of the El Gordo Sweepstakes  urlLink scam  which claimed we had won $615,810.00.  It looked rather legitimate (the entire family is very skeptical, but this one passed our first defenses), and even the Spanish phone number provided panned out (the Voice on the other end claimed we had been randomly entered through a purchase).  I cautioned against even bothering to go this far, but subsequently performed a Google search which turned up the scam.  ~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-= I think that I've been pretty frustrated with the way my formal mathematical education has gone.  I've seen the way many of my friends have forced the system to work for them, but it was already too late for me at the time.  I've never truly been challenged by a math class; I think by now I could've comfortably handled high school math plus at least another year of calculus, and linear algebra and differential equations.  By now, I'm sort of settled in an "oh-well" attitude to the situation.  With BC Calculus clashing with AP Chem last year, I was forced out of even getting a single year ahead and had to take 3 sciences instead (I don't particularly like statistics so I decided to just take the exam senior year).  For those not in the know, I've decided quite firmly to pursue a pure mathematics major.  At least I can be sure I won't be out of my depth.    ~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-= I promise: more later when I sort my jumbled ideas out.  Vivaldi's Four Seasons has helped in this regard.  ~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=~-=   Book of the Moment:   e: The Story of a Number , Eli Maor

       On Tuesday morning I went with my father to Austin to get my laptop fixed.  We ate lunch at an Indian restaurant and then eventually managed to find the repair store which was up in the hilly part of the city where we were handled by a rather capable repairman.  2-3 days is the word.  We'll either pick it up soon or do it when I'm at the UT Honors Colloquium in a few weeks.  I think I've survived rather admirably without high technology (7 weeks and counting).    I have to be up early the rest of the week to take the TAKS portions I missed during the school year: math, social studies and science.  I think the instructions each day will probably take longer than I will to finish the tests.  I had better be able to leave once I'm done; I will be distinctly annoyed otherwise.  I wish there was some form of exemption from all this foolishness.  Then I remember that I'll never have to take the TAKS again and that instead it will offer opportunities to sleep in during the next year.  Yay for TAKS!  Recently, I've been faithfully following the dictionary.com  urlLink word of the day .  Being an avid word-gamer, and especially an ardent devotee of Scrabble, I have developed three levels of recognition for words: ignorance, awareness, and cognizance.  Yesterday's word 'congeries' fell into the middle fuzzy category.  I saw it, and something clicked and I instantly thought 'hodge-podge' without having seen its definition.  I've perhaps seen the word once before, but I think had you asked me its meaning earlier I would've been stumped or a little hesitant.  It's rather an odd phenomenon and bears watching.

       Well, I've been studiously ignoring the blog again.  It's been the usual lately: frisbee &amp; bridge.  And for the first time, both yesterday.  2 assists and a score in my team's first 4 points and then I left to get  thoroughly  smashed in cards by  urlLink S.  and  urlLink C.  despite a valiant last ditch effort by my  urlLink partner  and me.  Still, all good fun.  Once I came home, I began thinking about a new design for the website and started on a plan.  I've continued the work throughout today, but am very displeased with certain aspects of what I have now and satisfied with much of the rest.  I feel that I'm headed in the right direction, at least.  I'll post a screenshot here before I update and reorganize the entire site in the next few days.
