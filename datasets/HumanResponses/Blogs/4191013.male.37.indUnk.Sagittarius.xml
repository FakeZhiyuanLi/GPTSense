      It's like that point on a  urlLink rollercoaster , when you seem to spend forever chugging up a virtiginous slope of track, that point when you suddenly straighten up and you can see the vast plunge in front of you.  The point where you realise that there's nothing you can do but hang on for dear life.  We exchanged contracts on Friday. The moving date has been set for the end of the month.  We will be resident in Reading come the  first of September.  Now all we have to do is work through the 38-point list Clare has put together of notifications to be made and people to tell, make sure the removal company we've lined up are good to go, make nice to work for taking off what has the potential to be one of the busiest days of the year, visit everyone before we go, and find time for a bit of blogging inbetween.  Easy. Who said moving was stressful?

      We've been working with a bunch of Swedish film students on a short that's been garnering some interest, to the point where they've been doing reshoots. The first roll of those came in today, complete with clients, and someone from Channel 4 filming interviews who also wanted some shots of the telecine process. This is the point where I made my excuses, and left the job in the hands of Simon,  the  second day colourist. I've had this before, and if there's one thing you don't want to be doing, it's trying to concentrate on an enormously complex job with a high cock-up ratio, while someone's sticking a camera in your face. All it takes is for one of those tense little moments ("Are you sure that's in focus? What's that mark? No, it's more of a  warm  blue...") and you can see your professional demenour dissolving in public. Not nice. Simon loved it, apparantly. He made sure they got his best side.

      Well, the simple answer would be because every other bugger is doing it. However. I'm doing it because 2004 is turning into the year where everything seems to be happening, and it's about time I started documenting it. So far this year, I have had a promotion at  urlLink work , finally shed a fairly chronic  urlLink skin condition  that was slowly but surely turning me into the Phantom of the Opera, completed a rather excellent  urlLink creative writing course , and sold our house. We are now trembling on the verge of exchange and completion, and are girding ourselves for the big push out of London. We are heading west, for thrills and excitement in *ahem* Reading. Don't laugh, it's cooler than it sounds.

      Blimey, hot over the weekend, wunnit? Close. Moist. Too hot to sleep. Ended up glued to the mattress by my own nocturnal emissions (I was SWEATING, alright?) What we needed was a nice drop of rain. And now we've got it. Bleedin orrible. Now my jeans are damp after the walk into work, and it's cold, dark and miserable and I miss the sun. No, I am not easily pleased.
