      Hey. Just got back from Anitas party. What a day. School sucked. When i got home, i went out on my bike and rode w/ Max. We went all the way to Lowes Theather (spelt wrong.) We had to go across this huge bridge and he was scared of heights. Once we got there, we went under the bridge and through all these woodsy areas. Then, we went down this huge hill, came back up it and almost got ran over. After, we went to the HP park and then rode home. I then went to Village  Pizza and went to Antas. What a day. It kinda sucked in ways but yeah. Ok. c ya.

      Modding is the art of voiding your warranty.  So far max and i have been doing a little modding. Visit  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  to see. You can also mod your xbox. I soon will be doing this. When modding your xbox you could play DVDs w/o the DVD remote and you could play music and copied games. You could also back up games to the hard drive and you could replace the hard drive with a 12o GB hard drive. There is many ways to do this. If you screw up Microsoft(c) will not replace your xbox. So you really need to know what you are doing. To learn more go  urlLink here.   Later.

      Here is a way to can easily crack windows passwords by gaining phisical access to someones computer.    One way-       How to easily crack a password protected Windows user.           1.Boot      into safe mode by holding F8 during startup and choose Safe Mode with Command Prompt              2. Once it boots up, choose Administrator.       <>3. Once the Command Prompt boots and everything else, type in the command prompt  "Net User" (With out "")       <>    4. Choose the user that you want to crack the password. Do this by then typing "Net user  {username}" (w/o "" and where it says {username} that is where you put the  name of the user w/o the {} )    <>5. All this random stuff will show up. Make sure this user is an Administrator by   checking through all the random stuff if it says "User may change password" and  next to that it says "Yes"       <>6. Once you see that they can change the password, type "Net user {username}  {password}" (w/o "" and where it says {username} or {password} that is where  you put the name of the user or password desired w/o the {} )      <>    7. Once you have done that, reboot regularly and login to that user using the password  you typed.     Note: If the Username is more than 2 words, this won’t work. Also, this won’t work if the Administrator has a password.      Heres another:      urlLink Go here and learn.      Use at your own risk!!!!  Later!

      If you have a laptop that has a wireless pc card in it you are in luck. What you do is going around driving in a car and find wireless access points. Now i am not telling you to steal your parents car and wardrive all across the US. What you do is take the laptop when you go on a trip. Fire up the computer and run a program called  urlLink Netstumbler.  What Netstumbler does is rapidly scan for access points. Once you find one you can just click and surf. Now wardriving may be illegal in states and countries so dont break the law. Also Netstumbler doesnt work with all wireless cards. Find more info at  urlLink www.wardriving.com   Later!

      I know this is a real illegal thing but download music is a big thing. Most people use kazaa, which contributes spyware and adware. Limewire ( urlLink Windows Users ) ( urlLink Mac Users ) is spyware and adware free. Also, versus kazaa, it has fast downloads, real fast. Some other features include customization and a way to select to not share your music. Sharing music is a lot worse than downloading so make sure you turn sharing off. It also makes downloading music faster. Limewire is defiantly a great music downloader. If you have trouble with this than use Kazaa K++ (no link). It is still kazaa with no spyware and adware. -Nick.dat PS. Not my problem if you get fined or get caught by the RIAA or other big music industries.

      Slow internet connections? Lots of pop-up? Then you really should look at this article. Recently I read and I found that you can secure your comp for free. All you have to do is download a few files assuming you already have a router.  Antivirus:  urlLink AVG Antivirus Sysytem - The great thing about this is that it is free. When you set the settings make sure it updates every night. If it does not, newer viruses come out and you comp will be infected. You will need to give you e-mail out to recieve a code or just ask me.  Spyware and Adware Removal:  urlLink Spybot Search and Destroy - Great free spyware remover.                              urlLink Adaware - Cleans out ads.  Firewall: When you get a comp, the first thing you'll notice the minute you connect into the internet that you are giving your comp to the world. What a firewall does is asks you whenever a file tries to send or recieve data to the internet if it is ok or not.  urlLink Keiro Personal Firewall - I use it. Ask me for the settings.  urlLink Zone Alarms - You should maybe go with this one.  Updates: Update Windows frequently by Going  urlLink here  Click Windows update on the left hand side! Make sure u open this in Internet Explorer! That's Basically It. Now you will have a safe comp. And if your comp is really infected, ask me to do this. I will and i already have these files on CD so just ask me to "fix" your comp. Will installing, Disconnect the comp from the internet.  LATER :)!

      Having trouble with Internet Explorer? Hate how you can't customize it? Being hacked? Your in luck! Try Out  urlLink mozilla firefox.  With this you can customize like there is no tomorrow. All you have to do is download the executable and follow the directions. At the end it will ask you if you want to import anything. If you have been using IE, check Import Internet Explorer. Also, dont make it your default browser! Here are a few of my favorite themes and extentions.  Theme:         urlLink Qute  - Great theme. Looks very basic and clean.  Extensions:  urlLink BugMeNot  - Read the info.  urlLink Downlaod manager tweak  - Read the info  Get More Extensions (  urlLink http://texturizer.net/firefox/extensions/  ) Get More Themes (  urlLink http://update.mozilla.org/themes/?application=firefox  )  A few more great things about Mozilla Fireox is that there is an internal pop-up blocker and the feture to have tabbed browsing. What is tabbed browsing? Well take you mouse, right click a link, and select "Open Link in New Tab." Instead of having all these wintows on you taskbar, the windows are filed into tabs on your browser.  Newer Versions Are Frequent. Refer back to here a lot and you will be notified. Any other questions? E-mail me at  urlLink lilmoonwalker11@yahoo.com  . Any questions with this, go to  urlLink http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/  . You questions will defenitally be answered there  Later! :)
