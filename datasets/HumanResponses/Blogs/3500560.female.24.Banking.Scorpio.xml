      Ok here's the scoop...I'm trying desperately to move to California, and I'm going on my own, but I do want to find a roommate.  So, being the computer savvy gal I am, I sign up to not one but 2 of these roommates services.  I answer all their questions, that range from how old are you, to what my sexual preferences are, to how long I leave my Chinese leftovers in the fridge (usually 2 days, or I eat it that night..oink oink baby!) And when I went to check on my email tonite I had  47   messages, and 45 of them were from the roommate services!  It turns out that I match many same qualities with most of L.A.  (I guess we all are little oinkers who eat our food right away)...I just feel like I'm waiting for my cue to go onstage and begin my life.  I have all my lines memorized, I have my resume, my headshot, I'm full of vim and vinegar (or piss and vinegar if you ask my dad hehehe) but I need to move to make this happen!   So I continue to look and search for my match, a non-psycho roommie who wouldn't mind being my friend as well.  Any tips?

      Yay, I finally joined the rest of the world and got a blog!  I sit here munching on rice cakes, wondering what I will learn and what you will learn from me.  I hope to learn a lot, maybe get a roommate out of the deal (more about that to come)I hope you will like what I have to say, and if you don't thats ok to, cause I hope I still entertained you in the long run, even if you just think all I do is babble.  (Sometimes I do, so feel free to stop me!) Maybe I will teach myself something out of this whole ordeal...whatever the case may be, I'm here to have fun!

      So as you already know I have been looking for a roommate.  Well, I think I finally found one!  I don't want to get my hopes up but she seems really nice and the place sounds amazing.  I read another blog today, entitled Caliblog, and I read back to their first entries, and I felt like I knew them.   There are 3 of them who moved from Michigan together to try to make it in the entertainment biz. They are already living in Cali, but their trepidations from before their move made me feel like I wasn't alone out there after all!    So I just came back from my first spinning class at Bally's.  Take away the hurt feeling in my bum and I liked the class a lot. The instructor was really nice too, which is so refreshing because I have now taken 2 classes at Bally's (I've only been a member for about a month) and the other instuctors were nice, but I didn't feel welcome.  But this guy went out of his way to make sure that we stood on the bike properly, held the handles correctly and so on.  Soooo nice....  Anyways, off to make dinner...tonite we are having left over veggie pizza!  yum!

      Ok, what happened to a little thing I like to call follow-thru?  I called a month ago to have my gas shut off, I then moved shortly thereafter, and got a bill from them today.  At first I was thinking it was the last little bit I owed, from maybe, let's say 2 days of use.  But no...they never shut off my gas in the first place, so I'm now charged with another month!  Of course, I will not be paying this, and the first thing in the AM they will get a lovely phone call from moi... Anywho...I had a nice dinner with my sister tonite at TGIFridays.  We got to talking and when we were growing up, she always had probs with my dads sickness.  (HE has crohn's and had it all my life...thats almost 25 years) Well, of the four kids in my family, we each dealt with this our own way.  My sister chose to pull her hair and eyebrows out, something called trich.  Well long story short, she didn't finish high school and didn't go to college b/c of trich.  Well now she's 20 and starting to feel left out.  She speaks to her friends, all of who party like normal 20-somethings, while at their schools.  My sister has no one...she works at a job with mostly older women, which she can't stand, but the benefits are good so shes stuck between a rock and a hard place on that one.  I told her she she do whatever it takes and take one class at the tons of local schools near us.  I said to take a loan do whatever and just add something to your life.  She knows she wants to be a guidance counselor and help others, which i think is really noble.  I want to help her so badly, I wish she had more friends.  She has a terrific boyfriend and our family loves him, but I want her to be able to go out with other friends and just have fun.  Instead she just feels left out.  Ok, thats all I just wanted to vent...my contacts are starting to dry out, which is odd because i just went to the eye docs today and these are new...oh well, i guess thats another visit i will have to make.  sweet dreams....
