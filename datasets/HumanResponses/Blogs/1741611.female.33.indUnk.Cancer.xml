      Hey there.. Well I learned the results of the xrays this morning, I have mild spinal deterioration *terminal*, she also said I have a disc in my neck on the verge of disintegrating.. She gave me Naproxin and some anti depressent that is supposed to help "balance" things.. as she put it. I go back again in a month. She is also referring me to a physical therapist *yippee** I remember this from last time! Anywho gotta get moving... more soon Mage26

Only other one doing good that I started from seed is the cilantro.. my lavender, rosemary and catnip didn't do too good thanks to hubby's brat kitty! who's sitting in my lap right now being a very big pain! Yesterday was my daughter's sixth grade graduation .. its too SOON! **shaking head* what's worse she raided MY closet for that perfect dress and MY shoes! lmao ..  Anywho gonna go for now since this lil brat kitty just seems to think he needs attention CONSTANTLY .. Hugs Becky

      Sound like us, I have bush peas, trellis peas, sweet 100 tomatoes (only ones I've had luck with!), and about three different varieties of bell peppers including habenero!,strawberries, brussel sprouts, broccoli, lettuce, walla walla sweet onion, and green beans. To date, the trellis peas are bout as tall as me 5', and my berries have three runners! So we're getting there slowly and with the HELP of my cats the population of mice and moles are slowly depleting so to an extent animals are an aide to gardens. Is your dog digging? There are a few ogranic variety replellents out there on the market today that MIGHT proove useful. Keep me informed! By the way am a grandma AGAIN as of 11:15 last night my adopted brat gave birth to baby girl:D I KNEW she would have her before my birthday and walla the tuesday BEFORE my birthday none the less.. mine is the 22nd! Anywho .. gotta get moving for now more soon Becky

      Hey Rebecka - What's going on hon? We finally got garden in today, I still need to throw in a few different varieties of fresh herbs, you know...Lemon Balm, Basil, etc.....  We're having the damnest time keeping our one dog to stay out of the garden, I even set up a fence...that little bastard.  We didn't go way over board this year...just have a few tomatoes, peppers, beans/peas, cucumbers as well as the herbs...I hate weeding and being that I work from home, well guess who gets stuck doing it...yours truly :o)
