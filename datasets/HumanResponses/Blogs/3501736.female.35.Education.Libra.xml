      Yesterday a boy that I knew for many years killed himself. He lived down the street with his grandparents. He went to public school and I went to Catholic school. I always thought he was VERY cute but my mother told me that he was not the kind of boy that I ought to be hanging out with so I stayed away from him. I always thought I would like to know him better but the time never really came up, then he moved back in with his mother and I only saw him occasionally.  I got married to a horrible man and was miserable for five years. During those years I would see him now and again and tell him 'Hi' or wave at him as he drove by. I found out that he liked to LARP and I thought of asking him to come play with us but the time never seemed right. Not too long ago I went to see his grandparents and he was there. I interrupted dinner but he still took the time to leave his meal and make me feel welcome. He listened intently to all I had to say. By this time I was divorced and remarried. He never met my husband. Today my mother came to tell me that he had killed himself. He had been injured in an accident and had become addicted to pain killers. He went into rehab for it and somehow, either because of the medicine or the addiction, he decided that he could no longer bear to be with us in this world. He waited until his mother left for work and then got into the shower, turned it on and shot himself. His mother discovered him when she got home nine hours later. Because he left the shower on and his body blocked the drain it caused the house to flood. Now his mother has no son and no home. The house has been abandoned due to 'biohazard' and she will be paying for his funeral as well as having to pay to have the house cleaned. The authorities will not allow her in until everything that came in contact with the bloody water has been cleaned or destroyed. It makes me wonder why things happen like they do. His grandmother is beside herself. His mother is still in shock and denial. There will be no funeral, just a memorial service. He will be creamated.

      I have often wondered why it seems that I have nothing interesting to write about. I teach school, I am married to an aspiring cartoonist/animator.  We are on the verge of making it big......and I mean really big. I have a home and a beautiful Siamese cat and a fat rat. I have all that I could ask for.  Well, I don't have any children, but that is a whole 'nuther story. So, why do I feel that I have nothing interesting to give to the world? I want to write but when I write I feel like it is not good. I get compliments on it and even some interest but it does not make me happy. Actually, I believe that I am the biggest CHICKEN ever to live.  I have friends who just throw their junk into their car and set out to Hollywood or New York.  They get there and seem to make it just fine.  Hell, one just got her movie put out on video and distributed through Blockbuster!! *sigh* I guess I need to get off my ass and get working. Well, thanks for listening, actually I mean reading.
