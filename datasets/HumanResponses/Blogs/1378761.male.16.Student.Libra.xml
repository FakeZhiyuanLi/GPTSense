      As most of you know, the northeast is without power. Ohio is considered in the Grid, but here in Auglaize County we all have power. Just up north they have no power (Toldeo). As far a I know Lima does. I kinda wish we didn't. Then I can tell everyone what I was doing when the power went out. Saint Marys has it's own power plant and we own a 5500 watt generator full of gas. O'well. Just fell sorry for the folks that don't because it is hotter than crap outside.   Well this is the new blog. I will post stuff up here every once in a while (when school starts I will have some more bored time). When I update the website I'll post the changes I made here, so be looking out.  That's it for now. Catch you later ~Eric~

      Right when I got out of the car from coming home from school, a UPS truck pulls up. I was so excited. Whenever the UPS truck comes I am excited. So there comes Keith, the usual driver. He handed me a large box. I new it was the barebone computer system I ordered off eBay. So I took it inside and opened it up. There is was in all of its pride and glory. After I transferred all the components over from my old case to the new one, I fired it open and BAM!! – Nothing. After hours of troubleshooting and on hold with tech support we finally found out it was the motherboard (Had the feeling all along). So now I have to send that back in and wait another 2 weeks to have my new system. CRAP  Every Friday in English we have to write a 20 line journal. So I thought it would be a good idea to post it up on my website. I’ll probably create a new blog for it. I don’t know. Second day of school was off OK. I had a little fight with the school sys admin (or the wanna be admin) about getting IP address for some computers. No no, he wants to come and install Novell. The last thing I want is Novell on the Dells. I guess I will have to make up some IP numbers and hope he never stops by. Friday was just a bad day period…….  I had to go and tape the football game against Sidney High School. We won by a couple points. It was funny because there school is very old and we were taping out of a classroom and Mr. Spencer was out on the roof and pieces of plaster were falling from the floor above. If that wasn’t scarry enough every time the other team scored they shot off a cannon and it startled Spencer every time. Then we toped the night off eating Rallies. I do love their fries but the sandwiches are getting smaller and smaller.   I have been looking at a lot of blogs lately. I guess I need to start updating the  urlLink links  section of my homepage. Blogs are cool. They are a great way to express yourself and tell people about yourself. Lookin at this blog right now:  urlLink Oomphe-Girl . Her name is Rachel, 15, and lives in Canada. She is a geek and likes  urlLink TSS  too. That’s cool. Someday maybe we will meet. That's It! Have a great big  urlLink TechTV  Fan gathering. That would be alsome!!! Have the whole cast come and travel around for a week to meet people and sign autographs. That would be cool. Gee, I guess I am obsessed with  urlLink Leo  and Pat. O well, I will get to meet them some time or another. Thinking about a road trip after I graduate. Make my way around America, stop and meet some people, make new friends and visit some old ones. I would also like to visit my cousins in Kentucky. Kentucky is SOOO laid back.   Just Dreaming Here!  Dam, almost a page in MS Word. LONG blog entry this time. We’ll see how the next one goes.  As always, ±±Eric±±

      School offically started today at 7:55. It was a long, hot, boaring day full of lectures and speeches. I would rather do homework than listen to some old person raddle off rules and polices. By 7th period I was sick to my stomach from boardium and heat.   It's nice to see friends and people you haven't seen in a while. It is werid seeing little freshman running around noing you was once one of them.   I have found out that I will spend last period working on computers! Yep-he. The best part is, the room is air conditioned!!! I guess I will be helping the techies by doing little things like fixing computers and printers. Better than sitting in study hall (with 150 people in a small room it gets a little toasty).   Working on a hot debet going on at  urlLink Leoville  about a Cat's butt ( urlLink Cat  is the co-host of  urlLink Call For Help  on  urlLink TechTV ). I can't belive how people put down other people like that. It's soo rude!  urlLink Do check out the picture though . She has a cute skirt that has a eye (I) a bee (B) and a M (M) -- what's that spell IBM!! Sound like a cheerleader over here.   In till the next blog session, Blog LATER!!!

      Roger That Housten ... T-2 days till school...Yikes!  Will It's that time of year again ... SCHOOL. School starts Thursday but I was there today and I will be there tomorrow. I am geting the computers and video equipment ready for the Football game friday. It's away, but we have to go film it. Something happened today with a special video conference computer today. I opened it up to talk the hard drive out (to format it from NTFS to FAT32 for Win98) and when I was done the BIOS said "WARNING! Computer case opened". I have never seen that before - strange.   It's hot in school like normal. I am sweeting just seating down. I guess school won't be bad this year, having to free periods.   Had someone from Leoville E-mail me today. His name was Eric, the Webmaster of www.ericville.com. I think that it was so neat finding someone with the same intrestes and the same name. He is in 6th grade up one state in Michigan. I usally post at Leoville's Mob section @ http://leoville.textamerica.com (I think). I love watching TechTV's The Screensavers. It's the best geek show out there.  That's all the time right now. Blog you lat8er

      I changed the counter on the homepage to Bravenet. With bravenet I can stop it from counting me and other cool stuff. I also added one on the Blog page.   Went to the Library yesterday to get the Book "Rainbow Six" by Tom Clancy. It is a very good BUT very long book, totaling at 740 pages. It is a monster to carry around. I had to get a new library card, as I lost my old one when my wallet got lost. It is neat how you can request books online and pick them up at the library. It is one of the best features I can think of. I am going to read all of Tom Clancys books. He is one of my favorite authors.  Well school starts this THURSDAY. Bummer! I guess it is getting kinda boaring anyways. I guess I will have more free time at school to write HERE in my blog. For some reason they gave me study halls for 1st and 8th period. You are only allowed one. Someone must like me somewhere.   As you probley all ready noticed, I am a terriable speller. Thank God for Spell Checker in WORD!  That's it for now. Blog you later! //Eric\\

      OK so I sent that motherboard back Monday after school. It cost $10.00. That's unreal after I had to pay $35 for shipping the system to me. That's $45 in shipping! O'well. Sitting here in Study Hall - I have been re-assigned to the Computer Lab to help them out. That's good - I get to work on computers in air condidtioning.   Wow last night was a werid one. I was working on my dad's roof putting shingles on when it started to get dark. I just thought a little storm was moving in. Then all of the sudden they tornado alarms went on. Holy crap! The wind started to blow hard, so we got down, just as we got down it started to rain. And main, it rained! I could not see 10ft in front of me! So we all went inside. After about 10 min the alarms went of. I guess we didn't get one, but I herd one touched down outside of town. I went outside and the neighbor's tree fell down. It was blocking the whole street. There was lots of sirens but I forgot my scanner at my mom's house! Well the power was off for about 5 hours, so I was stuck doing Biology homework useing my flashlight. It was fun though.  Well that's all the Blog I have in me at this time.  **Eric**

      Just got back from Cincinnati. Had lots of fun. We went down to the Riverscape festival to see the fireworks over the Ohio River. We went to the same park as we have been for years now. They always have the best fireworks. I drove down to Dayton to pick up Troy. The ride went perfect on the way to Dayton, but once in it went down hill. We had to call Troy to come and pick us up. Then we went back to the Crime Lab so he could park his car their (were he works). He parked their and he drove the rest of the way to Cincinnati. At first there wasn’t many people their, but at the last minute they all came. We got their really early and saved a very good seat. We were like the first person their. We got to set down while most of the other people had to stand up.   I sent the money order out for the new domain. The hosting has gone excellent so far. The customer service rocks! I can’t wait for everything to finally work out. I am going to make a sub domain for MTV. I hope to stream some small video files once everything is up and running. Man I love Front Page Extensions.  We won the football game on Friday. We are 2-0 so far. I hope we do good again. Playoffs were so much fun. Of course it had to rain for the whole game. Lucky I was inside helping, but I went outside to screw around and help the other camera people. I was soaked, so was Zach. I had a blast though. They had some HOT cowgirls! Yikies. Zach ended up staying the night and everything went hunky dory after that.   Pretty soon I should go to Radio Shack to fill out an application. My bank account is on E. My goal now is to take lots and lots of pictures. If I get a job, I want to get a new digital camera. The one I have now is from 7th grade. It is only 1 megapixel and sucks batteries like hell. Oh well, it works! These moments only happen once. I would prefer a smaller one over features. That is more important to me. Something that will fit in my pocket. Mine now is a hog. Put I still love it. Took many pictures on it with my 64MB CF card.   Not very excited about these upcoming two weeks. I will be staying about my dad’s house. Talk about no technology. It’s like little house on the parry. All of this while my motherboard is in the mail and my domain is being created. This sucks. I should be able to break away from it at least once a week, maybe twice. I can blog at school, but not check my e-mail. They would have a fit (the way I do).   I can’t find any more information in my brain for now.  Until next time,  ==Eric==

      We'll the game went pretty good today. I witnessed history as this was the first time overtime took place at the big horseshoe. Actually, it was as far as TRIPLE. And they won!!!   I brought my camera, but as my luck, they were prohibited. Imagine that. I had to walk all the way back to the vehilce. When I got through, I seen a couple people with camera and I asked how they got in. He was their response "I put it in my pocket. Nobody cares anyway." I found that to be true when someone asked a security officer to take a picture of them. He happily did.  We'll that's about it for now. See ya around! @@Eric@@

      Today was a long one. It being Sept. 11 and everything. We didn't do to much in school as I thought we would. Last year we made a powerpoint going along with the Alan Jackson's "That September Day". That was the one of the best projects I really enjoyed doing. This year for  urlLink MTV  we went around interviewing people, asking them about what they was doing and what they felt. I haven't seen the final product yet, but it is going to be good.  I bought a new video card today to go along with my new system. I found out that my video card, not my memory, was causing my computer to freeze. So I got the ATI All In Wonder 8500DV. Now I can do a little video editing on my system.   I think I am now officially out of money. I really need to get a job. Somebody hire me please!! I am going to bring my digital camera to school Friday. I need to get some more pictures. I love pictures.   Something really made me mad today. We I went to check out the  urlLink news  in 8th Period, There was some 9/11 virus out. That's really crummy. That's the kind of viruses that I really hate. Get a life people, please!  Their is going to be a special on  urlLink TechTV  Friday about the RIAA. It's a 2 1/2 hour special with my favorite  urlLink Leo Laporte  co-hosting. Watch it - That's an order.   We'll that's about it for now. Hope to blog you soon! ``Eric``

      Well today finally www.ericville.net is up and running. I am sooo happy! Finally the Domain/Hosting situation is now over. Wow I love my new domain!   I started up a moblog. I don't have a digital camera phone, but I am going to put up picture that I take with my digital camera. I know I know, lots of digital camera pictures are on the website. I am going to put up the misc ones thier that I don't have time to go through. Even some that will advently appear on the site. Well I am busy trying to get the archive section of this blogger account working. Stupid thing. I guess I will have to turn to blogger for help. I just transfered it over to the new domain, instead of the Bright.net account. I am getting their day by day I guess.  Thanks all I have to say for this Blog.  As always, ((Eric))

A lot happened since I last blogged, like getting my license, but I guess you will just have to keep going along. Can't go back now. Well like I said, I will try to blog more often.  That's all I can think of now. Good night everyone. **ERIC**

      OK OK I said this a lot in the past, but I am going to blog more often. How often you may ask? Well my new year's resolution is almost everyday. Yeah that's right - every day. I will let you know some of the exciting points of my day (not to many). So lets BLOG!!  Well I really didn't do to much today. I think I had a little hangover from last night (oh well). I started to watch Bad Boy 2 when I was rudely interrupted by the phone. It was Doug. He wanted to know if I wanted to help him but some Big Bear signs in Wess's yard. Like I said before, I already told others that I did not feel good tonight but how could I but this kind of offer down? So we ended up putting some signs in his yard. How fun!  By the way, send me some emails about the site! Any email would be great (not spam lol). Its  urlLink webmaster@ericville.net . Don't Be Shy!  I think that's about it for now. Until next time, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  (Lets hope 2004 will be a good one!) 2004~Eric~2004

Well nothing really to talk about. I am going to bed for now. By the way this counts as Sat the 3rds post. @Eric@

      Well I'm settin in here in the computer lab during a Jr high keyboarding class. Its really boring. Oh well.  For the last 3 days we have had no school because of snow. Today we had a one hour delay. Should have been a two but ol well.  As you can see I have been updating the site more frequently because MSNBC stopped its streaming news service. So no I have to update it by hand (It looks better though). There saying we are suppose to get more snow tonight. Probably have another delay tomorrow. Wont bother me too much. Have to work this weekend. Both Friday and Saturday, still better than Sunday night. I have been working nights. I really want to work sat/sun mornings.  Cya Later &&ERIC&&

      As you can see, I haven't been updating it as often. It is something I really want to do.   So today we had no school because of a snow storm. So today I updated the site a little by adding the Ericville gazette. MSNBC doesn't stream news anymore so I have to update it my self. I also put in school delays and closings. I am getting ready to put in some articles under the school section.   This weekend I went snowmobiling in Michigan with my dad and his friend. It was soo much fun. The trails are very nice and the woods looks beautiful with the snow in the trees.  I wanted to go riding around here today but I didn't. I also wanted to finish putting in the car started but I also didn't.  I am just lazy.  Well I don't have much more to say. It would make my friend Alyssa Ahlers A.K.A. "Snow Angle" to say her name on here. Hello Snow Angle (Long story behind that -> will talk about soon) and a hello goes out to her sister Natalie.  until the next blue moon, **ERIC**

      OK so far the diet has been working. Today I eat a slimfast bar and a fruit punch drink. I think I can keep going. I am also trying to cut back eating at work. I think a lot of it comes from eating the greasy chicken (Lee's) so no more chicken!!   I am thinking of redesigning the website. I want to make it look more like a city. I want to take pictures of signs and photoshop them into Ericville Signs. That is my dream. I also wanna do "A Day In A Life Of Eric" where all day I carry around a camera and take pictures. I think that will be very fun and look neat on the website. Any suggestions for the site? E-mail them to  urlLink eric@ericville.net  or  urlLink ericville_mayor@hotmail.com . I wanna hear from you!  We got out early today. That was so nice. So Al Snow had a press conference at school today. Mr. Spencer asked me to help and I pretty much got out of the school the rest of the shortened day (English and Spanish, then Study Hall) which didn't hurt my feelings, the only thing is I didn't go out for lunch, but I eat a slimfast bar instead which was prob a lot healthier than anything else. I really think I should lose some weight soon. I am in gym class to so I am getting more excerise then normal. When it starts to warm up I want to go joggin more often.  Its not bad out at the lake. If I go right now when it is cold, my throat always starts to bleed and herd. Its not worth that.  That about sums it up for today. Nothing much more to say other than that. Until the next session, your mayor, **ERIC**

      Again I am reporting live from the computer lab class during 8th period. Today was pretty boring, just checkin in on the top technology news stores for today.  Monday I went to a herbal/psychic lady as I call her in Fort Recovery. She looked into my eyes and said she can she all kinds of things. She said as was in some kind of traumatic accident in my life. I don't know what she is talking about. She did see that Josh had his tail bone hurting, that he did like 4 days ago sledding. So I dunno if she is right or not. I guess you just have to belief in it.   So I took the whole day off from school. I need the break. I went with Josh and we followed his uncle and grandparents up. I never really knew how small Fort Recovery was. But I did stop in at Fort Recovery High School to drop off a letter to Tim's cousin there. I said I was comming to Fort Recovery, but I always say that so she didn't believe me (now she will, lol)  Can you believe the price of gas?!! Its getting a little outrageous. Oh good news. Finally got my car starter on and working (Many thanks to Doug Axe - Audio Sound and Entertainment)  Ok so I am starting on a diet again. This time I am limiting what I eat for lunch. I dunno if it is going to work. I also bought the last supply of slimfast bars from Big Bear (They were going out of business so they were really cheap)  That's about it for now. I will cya around!! @#Eric#@

      OK so job shadowing is comming up. I am thinking about shadowing a FBI agent. That would be so cool. Today I called  the Divison Headquarters in Clevland, and the answered 'FBI'. How cool is that?!! Come on! How often do you call the FBI? I felt pretty good. I hope tommarow the FBI will be calling me!! Yeah. OK so if you don't already know, I am totally obessed with the FBI, Law Enforcment and Public Safety in general. If you listen to my voicemail, you would notice I love COPS. I LOVE COPS!!  I pretty much know all the codes for our local police department. I have a scanner on my desk in my office with an attenna on the roof, and a scanner in the car. I love to listen to police/fire. Have a story to go with this.  Ok so one night me and the gang (Gang refering to: Myself, Josh, Tim, and me thinking our guest Billy) were driving around. We started to follow the police which was easly for me because I have a scanner in my car. Well I guess we followed this one a little to close. So they got done pulling someone over at the church. There was like 3 cruisers there. I pulled out of a alley right after him. So he stopped at a stop sign. He then radioed in my license plate numbers back. He went straigh and I took a quick turn right.  He probely thought I would turn on the next road (a major road) but I didnt. I went straight and I forgot it was a dead in. So i quicky tured in the turn and there he was. He was turning around and I turned and spend and got out. He had to wait becase there was a car comming. So that was a close encounter. I also got pulled over another time for having no lights on, but he did'nt say anything.   So I really do have a thing up with Law Enforement. What can I say? Thats about it. Oh yeah. Let me just add that I really hate gym class. It is gay. Also I have this obsession with a girl that skips school a lot. She'll probebly lead me to trouble LOL.  Later, __ERIC__

      OK its  been awhile since I last blogged but what can I say. Things are seeming to go a little rough right now. Tonight I really wanted to just walk at lees. It was getting really old and for some reason I was feeling down. I don't know. I better finish up this blog. I have a lot of homework to get done. Geometry sucks!! I guess this is about all I have to say today. Maybe a bigger blog tomorrow? I don't have to work, but I have to stay after school to work on a video. Lets just see.

      Hey hey hey!!!  Well tonight is big time wrestling. Some wrestler named Al Snow is bringing other wrestlers and I guess it is suppose to be big. Its pretty expensive though, 13 dollars a ticket at the door!! I am going to video tape so it should be to bad.  I had to work today. 1-3. That isn't to bad. Didn't really have to do anything so. I have to work tomorrow morning 9-1. Last night we didn't do to much. We drove around but  nothing really happen. Couple pull overs and a underage drinking party, but they didn't do anything.  Well I guess that's about all for now. I'll try to update later tonight. "ERIC"

Make it a real Ericville Community. Well nothing happened really. Its been pretty low key except for my girl. I will publish about Amanda later. Oh today after school and and I went driving around and playing with people walking home from school. We asked for directions and asked one girl in a pervy voice "You wanna go for a ride little girl". Then we drove along and played with a TSC truck. We keep doing u-turns and going back and forth down this street. I think we freaked out this girl. I know this girl very little but she is in my gym class. She must live down their. Ha we drove up and down the street stoping and looking around. The guys in the truck were lafing but the girl (ha her name is amanda too) and some women was kinda freaking out I think. Oh well. Were gonna to it tomarrow for sure. Thats about it for now. Oh yeah I watch all the episods of the broken. They are alright. I want to see more out of them though.

      WOW what a weekend. I don't know how much to talk about, but it was pretty exciting.  Lets start with  Thursday.   Thursday was a normal school day. I had sucky gym. I hate gym. I went to lunch. I also talked to 2 FBI Agents. Yeah that's like a dream come true. Both of the agents said I can't job shadow them. That's a major bummer. Oh well. I guess I will have to find somebody else.   On Friday we had no school for presidents weekend.  I bought a new pair of boots.  They are steal toe and electrical resistant.  In the afternoon we ganged up with a few other fellows who all had CBs. So we hit the road talking, but didn't get too far. Instead I ended up getting chased by an ambulance because I could not get over in time. Yeah I knew the ambulance was coming, I heard it on the scanner. I followed it because for some reason it was going to Wapak. Who Knows.  Today I had to work 9-1. Yeah it pretty much sucked, but a lot better than working nights. I hate working nights. They asked if I could come in tomarow 11:30 to 1 cause they have like a shit load of chicken going out so. Any was after that I had to stop at the police department. More information later on about this. Right now it is marked confidential. Doesn't that sound so important? It makes me. After that I headed out to the outdoorsman to see what Tim was up to, Tim has to work like 8-4, but just on the weekends. It gets pretty boring out there for him, so plenty of people stop in to talk to him. While I was there Benny came in. I haven't seen Benny in like forever. It was soo weird seeing him again. He has like open heath surgery done so that's why. While I was there I was called by Kimmer, a policeman from SMPD. He talked a little, and I left to go to the police department again. After I left there, as I was going through the aly, I saw some office chairs by the dumpster. We'll get to that latter. So I went home for a while and relaxed. I went to Wapak with Troy, my stepdad, to go to the KOC chicken fry with an old friend. We have been going to this chicken fry there like forever. After that Tim and Josh were back. We drove around a little. After that we got a call and we picked some more people up, we had 5 people in my car. We drove around looking for stuff to do. We went through McDonald's and got 8 waters. There was this bitchy lady at the drive through and she charged us 10 cents each for the waters. Oh well. So we followed the cops around some. Of course they got suspicious and ran my plates. After that I stopped. We dropped everybody off except josh. So we ran to the police department and got the chairs out of the dumpster. Yeah we are pretty much weird.  So that was my holiday weekend in a nut shell. To everyone out there, Happy Valentines Day!!  //ERIC//  Today

      Wow what a suck ass night it was. So I was driving around downtime with some friends. We meet up with all kinds of people and we were making fun of the people at the Jamberee. So I pull into the post office to meet up with them again. I turned around the car to face them on my side (driver side). We talked for awhile then this car pulls up trying to come in. So I quickly backed up not knowing the door was all the way shut and it caught in the bush. Well the buch caught my door and bent it around. So the door bent way out, bending the hinges and the front pannel of the car. So the door would not shut. So now I am stuck without a car to drive. What a bummer!!!  Im tired. Im pissed. Im out.

      So today I had to work. It was busyer than hell because of lent and everyone wanting fish. Yes, Lee's has fish! I had to close friday, I was only suppose to work untill 6 but the manager wanted me to stay because of some other problems with Jesse, one of the other employees working that night. So I stayed and closed, wich it did'nt matter to much because everyone was at the b-ball game against Celina so it did'nt work out too bad. I guess Jesse did'nt get down untill like 9:15, when we close at 8, on a slow Tuesday night so thats why I had to close.  I really did'nt do too much more that night. Drove around thats pretty much it.  For now, Eric

      Alright so its been a ok day today. I had to work today, but what can I say, my car is back together!!! I had Alyssa pick me up for school tuesday morning. Ha, she went to the neighbors house and had her little sister Natile, run up to ring the door. What a dork lol. We went to McDonalds. I got my cap and a hashbrown. I love there caps, so does alyssa thats why we went. So that boosted my day up. I left school after lunch. Josh didnt go to school so I figured I did'nt have to either. lol. So today nothing really happend. We went to Taco Bell for lunch today. After that we had to swing by to pick up a cap for me and Alyssa and apple pies for Josh and Luke. Yes, Josh came to school today!!!!!! I think  I am addicted to caps. I dunno what to day. I just love caps!! Today nothing really happened else today. I had to work. We were busyer than hell!!! I need a break lol. But thats about it.  Untill the next blog session comes, This was another episoide of Eric's Life, Staring...Eric Brown (AKA Hacker)

      Well today was not to bad at all. Josh had to bring me too school this morning, because of my car. He ended up leaving around 3rd period lol so i was stuck to school. Alyssa drove to lunch. We went to Tasty Treat for a change. Dam they are expensive. After that we went over to Joshes house.  We checked on him. He said he was'ent feeling good but he looked ok.  What do ya expect? During geometry today Hannah Hobler leaned over and said "Eric, my desk is sticky". As she leaned over the other way I seen strands of gum attaching her butt to the desk. I just had to laugh. It was the funnist thing I had seen in a while. What really made it funny was that she was picking the gum off her ass the whole period. It was just funny than hell. I guess she is lucky that we sit towards the back. It would have been really embaressing if she was up front. But we had to laugh about it all day. So that was pretty much the highlight of my day. Alyssa ened up bringing me home after school, I guess she is becoming my person transporter. Well the good news is that my step-dad fixed the car. He put new hinges on the door and sprayed some touch up paint. I can't drive it tommarow because of the paint, but it will be done soon!! And the over thing is that I got out of work right at 8!! Ise'nt that great!!  Happy as ever, Eric

      Hey all!  Yeah I know its been awhile since I last blogged. Sorry!  So today has gone all right. I wound'nt say that good, but it can always be worse. I was late coming back from lunch today. I just went home by myself for a change. I usually go with Josh and Alyssa, but today for some reason I decided to go home. At home I warmed up some left over pizza from the other night. I went through and burned some of the songs I downloaded last night. I like 80s, so they were all 80's songs. Anyways they didn't say much about being late. It was somebody else in the office.   Well Wednesday I got to job shadow at the police department. It was great. I got to spend all morning there! When I first got there, we sat down and talked. It was great because they had 2 boxes of donuts to eat. So we talked about police, what he liked and didn't like. His name was sergeant Thornsberry. He was great. He has a very good sense of humor, but knows when too much is too much. After that he gave me a tour of the station. It isn't that big of a station, but still it was fun. Then I sat down and talked to the chief for about a half hour. He was great too. I talked to him about there different types of calls and there salaries. Then sergeant Thornsberry came back and I went with him to go out patrolling. It is like a dream come true to go out patrolling in a police car. We stopped all over and got to pull someone over for speeding. He showed me everything about the car, like what's in the trunk, the radios, camera, and the radar gun. I had some much fun with him. Later on he got called back to station to do something more important, so I went driving around with another officer named Gary James. He was a very neat officer too. We went around some more patrolling. While we were out, I asked them if there was any laws against people following cops using scanners. He said "We might be able to pull something out. Why? Have you been doing it? You don't drive a little red car do you?" Ha, I about shit my self, because I do drive a little red Mercury Tracer. It was so funny. He just started laughing and saying how he seen my like 4 times last Saturday night and stuff. I just thought that was really funny how they know what my car looks like. But they would have to because I follow them all the time.  Well I gotta get going. Its time for me to patrol the school hallways. Until we meet again, eric

      Honestly  Why did you do this? I thought you were a friend I couldn't really see You don't have to pretend   I thought you were better You seemed to be nice I hate this feeling, Feeling cold as ice   You hid yourself Behind my back Saying words And not looking back   I've went too long Feelings went right through But now I can see You aren't really you   How could you do this? It hurts so much more Thinking of yourself And no one more   You let somebody Rip your heart out Then maybe we'll have something Something we can talk about.   -- Sean Hyde, 16 Saint Pius X High School Pottstown, Penn.

       Friends Don't Always Last   by Ashley Baron   I try to be nice, but you just laugh. I'm not fitting in anymore, what can I do? You don't realize, but it's starting to hurt. When everything's just right, it always turns to dirt.  Help me, what am I doing wrong? I don't understand, I'm there when your not strong. I try to be happy most of the time, but it's getting harder now, knowing your friendship isn't mine.     My Friend   by Nokia  I feel like I've known you forever Although I only met you sometime this past year But our friendship will remain forever No matter what shall cross our paths and hearts  The best thing that's happened to me Is finding a forever friend like you You're there to listen, help, and talk to And best of all, I know I can confide in you  Some say the best love is one sprung from friendship So I feel this is why we should try Time leads us in this direction Should we follow on down the line?  Friendship and love are always intertwined Too close which sometimes causes confusion But if we don't try, we will never know if it was meant to be But forever you will remain my friend  I don't know if this is going to work I'm not totally sure we should try But I have all these mixed feelings Bottled up inside  I love you both inside and out as my best friend And I know that you love me that way too So when I say "best friends forever" That even means when I'm saying" Goodbye, I love you, too."     Left alone in the past   by Brande  Left alone in the past Forgotten friendships buried, never meant to last She walked away from me Why couldn't I foresee? Time standing still Another way to deal, another pill The sky is gray with hate One thing tore us apart, your fate Now what will you do? Who will confide in you? Remember the times we shared? Remember how well we paired? The consequences are tough You only knew how to treat me rough Who is next in line? Will you, too, break their spine? Look at what you've done This time I will stand in front of you, I won't run Don't bother me anymore All you touch, you tore What you wanted, you took Now I glance back, I take one last look You left me alone in your past Forgotten friendships buried, never meant to last

      OK OK Sorry about the long time no blog. Well tonight I had to work until close (9:00). For the last hour and a half I stood around doing nothing. I had to train a new kid, so I had someone to bitch around, but nothing for him to do!. Anyways toward the end I had to start making some chicken, which kinda pissed me off because I was cleaning the floor already. So when that was done, we started cleaning and had it all done by 5 till. Well Loryen, the manager tonight, would not let me leave. She said to go help Lindsey or something until my shift was over, which is 9:00 (5 minutes!). So I grabbed my mop and finished moping her section, which took no time at all. After that it was about 9:00, and she still wounden't let me leave. It kinda pissed me off. Oh well. After that I headed home and showered up. I was planning on going to the drive in with Ashley. So right when I was leaving to go to her house, there was a lot of sirens going out. That got me excited. So I finely later found out that someone was having a graduation party and that fire got out of control. No big deal so I didn't miss that much. Tomorrow I got to work 1 till close (8:00). It's a lot of hours, especially when I can only work 5 hours straight since I am under 16. This week since school is out, I will almost make 40 hours!! Money Money! On top of that he gave me another raise. That's great. Oh yeah. I also got a job cleaning Edward Jones! That should be an extra $20 a week, which I will need for gas. Christ look at the price of gas. Was a $2.15??!! That's BAD. It needs to go down!!! I am so glad that I have a little car. It gets about 26 miles a gallon. I am happy!! Zum Zum!!  So I am getting a little tired. I wanted to study some out of my Ham radio book. Oh yeah, I am getting my amateur Radio License. I want to become a weather spotter. I am also stating to be trained to help out the American Red Cross. I will help out local people around here if something would happen to there house, such as a fire, flood, or a tornado. It is a lot of responsibility and time. You have to respond to the scene and make sure the family is OK. You have to make sure they have a place to stay and then after that you have to help them recover all they lost. Also during the disaster, you have to help take care of the emergency workers, such as the firemen. You have to give them drinks and feed them if they are hungry. Its going to be a lot of work, but I think I am going to enjoy it.   That's about it for now. I am getting tired. I want to go to bed! Goodnight to ALL!!! Eric

      Let's see..today.....one word....boring!! I had to babysit today, which wasnt too bad, would of been better if i wouldnt have been feeling ill!  I went to go get my check, and then had to get gass because my fuel light was on!  Then i had to be to work at 5:30-close, which wasnt too bad since I got to be manager and didnt have to go any cleaning! haha i left that to the lil pee-on's that work there!(eric) hehe!  Well while i was doing paperwork, talked to eric, and decided to go out and do something! OK, now remember he got out of there 20 minutes before i did! And i went home got in the shower, did make-up all that good stuff, and he was still only 10 minutes ahead of me!  Good lord it takes that kid a long time to get ready!

Tonite i got into a major fight with my dad, and then had to go to work for a freaking half an hour, to finish up training on paperwork for a managers position.  I was already in a bad mood, let alone i had to put up with someone at work who would not stop talking to me about my previous boyfriends! Well then i went home and was waiting on rach to come over when my dad showed up at my mom's house!  We all got into a big fight which wasnt good!  Well then tonite, i was waiting on eric to get on the net, to talk to him b/c he is a really easy person to talk to, and i texted his phone and told him there was an emergency, joking around! well he took me seriously, and being the sweetheart he is, ran home to talk to me! Now i feel terrible that he did that!  I completely wasted his nite over a dumb joke! i am so sorry eric!  Rach come over tonite, and now we are watching mtv movies awards and being retarded doing crosswords!hehe! welp have a good nite everyone! -ash-

      Well today I am waiting on my DVD burner to come in the mail. It's coming by UPS and usually comes here around 3 o'clock so I guess I have to wait till then. I have to make a copy of the two DVD's I have at home right now, Runaway Jury and Save The Last Dance because they are due back tonight. Time Warner Cable will be here tomorrow MORNING to inspect the cable lines I put in my house and install the splitter needed for Roadrunner! Yeah! So now I can finally download my movies!! I have to stress morning cause it will be around 9 o'clock and I usually don't wake up that early. I guess I will have to go to bed early tonight! I think the cable guy will freak out when he comes into my office (that's were the main splice is) because its weird downhere. I will prob never come back here again. Oh well. The electrician was here yesterday just as I was leaving for work. I had to move one of my desk out so he can get to the power panel. I think it is official, my house is falling apart. LOL. He was kinda amazed at my office and just laughed at it and said that I will be making a fortune in the future because I am a really smart and intelligent kid. Ha that's funny! He liked the wires and boxes on the wall. I guess I will have to wait to see what the cable guy says. I usually laugh at Time Warner because we have this thing for hating them. Poor people. It's mainly because of there prices. But we now have TSC coming into town. I guess it will be a while till that get to my side of the town. I applied there for a job, then a couple days later in the newspaper there was an article about how they are bringing all these people over from Wapak to run the office in St. Marys. That kinda pissed me off but o'well. That would be cool to be a cable/telephone tech. I would die for that job. Guess I gotta wait. Well I better clean the office up a bit. The electrician made a mess and I never got around to clean it up yet. So I am office  until the next time comes, >>ERIC

      Ok Ok Ok..Eric is jumping on my case to blog..because I havent in two days! Well did anyone happen to see when the last time he blogged was?! A long time ago! So I hope you are happy now eric! Hmm nothing too exciting has happened to me lately!  I had to work tonight and we were very slow so it was very boring.  At work, we now have another "new eric." His name is brandon and the only time he ever talks is when eric is there. and that is because they are being mean to me!  I guess i am going to have to work on trying to get this kid to talk more like i had to with eric. Well maybe not...because now that i know eric really well...and he talks more..now i cant ever get him to shut up!hehe! My weekend was pretty boring..friday night was fun but saturday night one of my friends got caught with all of our alcohol and that really sucked!hehe! but oh well!  Dont really have any plans for the up coming days. just babysitting and working and being tired is about it. Eric makes me stay up until the crack of dawn to talk to him when he knows i have to be up at 7 am every morning!  Lately i have been working on my pool at my dads. trying to get it suitable to swim in. for some reason i cant get the cloudiness to go away and it is ticking me off!  I cant wait to swim in it!  As for this upcoming weekend, my dad wants me and my brother cole to go camping with him and the niemeyer side of the family for father's day weekend.  I dont know if i am going because i really cant stand that side of the family very well and to the fact i have to work all weekend. Still in the deciding process!hehe!  Work sucks! I am getting tired of being on paperwork.  And i havent had a weekend off in I dont know how long!  Not one!  I am about ready to say something to them! Today, i had to babysit again, like always. and then i also had to be to work right away..no break in between so i am like super tired! so in other words, good nite everyone! have a good week! -ash-

      Well nothing really happened today. I went to Sidney with my step-dad (Troy) and brother (Nick). We ate at Subbys and then went shopping at super wal-mart. He was off today because he was suppose to have jury duty, but in the end they did not need him. So we did a lil shopping. Update to the last post of mine: I got in my DVD burner. Ha I burnt like 6 movies and downloaded Shrek 2 so I got a couple of movies to watch lol. We are taking a mini vacation this weekend. Saturday is my cousin's college graduation party. That is all the way in Michigan so that is why we are talking a mini-vacation. We are leaving Thurday morning and going to my step-dad's employer's cabin somewere near lake Erie. We are going to Ceder Point Thurday or Friday, depending on the weather. Then Saturday morning we are leaving and going to Dundee to shop at Cabelas. After that we are going to go to the graduation party that evening. After the party we are going back to the caben to stay the night, then back on the road Sunday morning. I have to work Sunday night so we got to be back by 4 because I got to work with my favoritest co-worker Ashley (ha now she thinks she is a big shot cause she is gonna be manager, so we will just let her think that). Looks like I got to go up to the school Wedensday to meet with Mr. Spencer. Just talked to him on the net. I am going to copy a tape from the fire department and grab a dell editing computer while I am up there. My cell phone is dead. It was beeping for the longest time, so now it just shut off. Thought I should put that in there. I have been working on this for a couple of hours.  I had to re-cut and tape my brothers tape. The VCR eat his Dragonball Z tape. Prob cause he watches it soo much lol.   I am starting to work on my movie. It is going to be a full-feature production. My new production company is "Twilight Productions" (website comming soon!!). I don't have much info to give out right now about the movie. Once I get the site done there will be some info on there. My movie will prob be called "One Last Chance". It will be focused on a highschool kid range, yet good enough for an adult. More info on that later though.  Thats it for now. Until we meet again, this has been another Twilight Production **ERIC**

      Ha that is the one word to describe cedar point. Towards the end of the day, a great big storm moved in and totally ripped down on us. I was getting my picture drawn when it all started. O'well. It was a pretty good time after all up there. Our place of stay wasn't really considered a cabin, more like a house. Actually it was a house. I wasn't expecting that. Then we had the graduation party Saturday. First off we stopped at Cabaels on the way up. I picked up a rain coat there. Next it was the party. It was for my cousin's College Graduation Party / Family Reunion. All the family came up to see my Aunt Diane and Uncle Mike's new house. They used to live here in St. Marys then Mike got transferred to Michigan so that's how they got up there. I drove all the way home. It wasn't too bad. It took like two and a half hours to get home. Its crazy how in Michigan people go 80+ miles an hours. As you can see it didn't take very long.   I got a GMAIL account!!! So far it seems to be pretty cool. I must say I like the search feature. I don't think it will replace Outlook though. Give me a email at  urlLink ericville@gmail.com  to help test it out.   You are probably wondering why I am up so early. Well my alarm clock was an hour ahead. I am to go in to work by 9:00. My alarm was an hour ahead and I didn't even notice until I got there and wondered why nobody else was there. Can't believe I did that. Ha.   So there was my excuse for not blogging in a while. Vacation. It took me awhile to figure out how to get internet up there. I got it, but on a very limited bases. Actually my genus brain came up with the idea on how to get internet. I had to buy a 120 minute phone card from Wal-Mart. I used that to dial up the internet back at home. It wasn't that bad of an idea. That was the only way to get a local number. The speed was a fast the first time (45.5kbps) but the next time it jumped way down to 28kbps. As you can see that was way to slow to do really anything. I just thought the idea was genus though.   Well I think I might get some breakfast. I'm off to eat.  ++eric++

      When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, When the road you're trudging seems all up hill, When the funds are low, and the debts are high, And you want to smile, but have to sigh, When care is pressing you down a bit, Rest if you must, but don't quit.  Life is queer with its twists and turns, As everyone of us sometimes learns, And many a failure turns about, When he might have won had he stuck it out. Don't give up though the pace is slow, You may succeed with another blow.  Success is failure turned inside out, The silver tint of clouds of doubt, And you never can tell how close you are, It may be near when it seems so far, So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit, It's when things seem worse, that you must not quit.

      Don't let your parents down, They brought you up.  Be humble enough to obey, You may give orders someday.  Choose companions with care, You become what they are.  Guard your thoughts, What you think, you are.  Choose only a date Who would make a good mate.  Be master of your habits, or they will master you.  Don't be a show off when you drive. Drive with safety and arrive.  Don't let the crowd pressure you, Stand for something or you'll fall for anything.

      Alright my neck is feeling a lot better!! I am still not allowed to work or drive till Friday though. I am getting though it slowly but surely. It is getting really boaring staying at home all the time. I am watching a lot of movies, but not working on mine. I worked on  urlLink Twilight Media's website  some. I also am working out some more weddings to get done. Possibly 3. I am excited. I am still working out my prices. I am going to talk to Mr. Spencer and his brother Rich to see how my prices are. Rich films a lot of weddings and has lots of experence.   I have the fender for my car all painted. It took 2 cans of finish spray paint and 1 can of clear coat. It dose'nt look that bad at all. I am going to buy some red-stained wax for my car to hide some of the paint chips from stones. I should help it too look better. I hope by this weekend my car will be a hotrod!!!  Thats about all I got for now. Cya later!! Eric

      Hello and how is everyone??!!. Well let’s rewind to last Thursday night, I had to work, and that night I slipped and fell. Ouch is about the only thing to describe it at the point. It really didn’t hurt to much that night. Well when I woke up the next morning holy cow I felt awful. I probably laid in bed for an hour because I could not move. Well I got up and called my mom to see what to do. She came at lunch and meet with my grandparents who agreed to call the Chiropractor. Well a couple hours later I went to the doctor. He was pretty surprised to see my condition. He said this was the worse neck non-auto accident injury he seen in a long time. Ha believe me it felt like it! Well first off he examined me and then we went back to take some x-rays. We took 3 x-rays. The last one didn’t turn out, but he still showed me the other two. Well after he showed me were my bones were suppose to be and how off they were, we went back to take the last one again. As soon as he left and went to take the x-ray, I fainted. I hit the ground hard making a large scare on my forehead. The fall also didn’t help my neck out at all ether. After my faint he was pretty hesitant to work on me anymore. He called my mom right away and she walked down from work. He wanted me to go to the doctor's office or the hospital to get examined. So we walked back down to Edward Jones were we meant my grandparents. After we talked for a little bit my grandpa walked me down to ask him if there was anyway he could do and so he started to work on me some. After that I still felt like crap. So I went home and laid around. That is pretty much all I did all weekend. I watched A LOT of movies!! Some good, some bad. Today I felt a lot better. I started to do a little bit more stuff than this weekend. I drove for the first time since Friday, which probably wisent that good of an idea. I went over to visit Ashley. I knew she had a hard time last night and I also missed her. So I was over there for a little while, mostly using her phone to take pictures of her. I started working on my car Thursday. I went and got a new fender in lima which sent me back $70. I almost got it all painted. I have a lot of my car tore apart because I was planning on working on it the next morning but I guess there goes that plan. I will get it done soon. I also missed my Ham Radio Exam Sunday. Now I got to wait another month to take it. Well I am going to get going. Also if anyone wants a gmail account let me know.   Bye Bye!! Eric

      Hey everyone! Exciting news, i got into a wreck on saturday night! You talk about scary, omg i dont know what i would have done if eric wouldnt have been with me! We were out driving around and it was about 10:30. i was driving, and i was heading back into town coming in on 703 past villa nova. i hit a guys bumper, but luckily it was a big truck/suv and with my little car i went right underneath him, doing no damage to his car. When he first stepped out i was already out of my car, he had this scowl on his face, giving me the impression i just hit a big jerk. But to my benefit, i didnt. The guy turned out to be really nice and didnt call the cops on me so they wouldnt site me! I filly went to go look at my car and luckily i didnt do too much damage. prolly just bout $2000 of damage. I cracked my fender, crinkled my hood just a littl bit and scuffed the paint pretty bad. After i called my mom, and she was done yelling at me, i went and took my car home and eric looked at it. he kept telling me that it wasnt that bad and that i was so lucky it wasnt any worse. but at that point i was completely shook up, nothing could have been any worse! well we jumped in eric's car and he was attempting to try and calm down. at first his voice was just a blurr and i had so many things running through my mind. I was so afraid of what my dad was going to say, and eric was insisting that he would go with me, if it made me feel any better. i decided to wait, because at that time it was getting late and i didnt want my dad to be woke up and startled thinking it was something terrible that really wasnt. We drove around a little bit more, all in the meantime, eric was still trying to calm me down! he was such a big help! i cant express that anymore! we went and parked at the lake, just messing around and talking the whole time. finally it was 11:58 and i had to be home at 12. so eric busted to get out of there otherwise i was going to be late. it was ok though! i was having fun being with him! i didnt care how late i was going to be, i was relaxed finally, and enjoying being with eric! Sunday nite, was the fourth of july. me and rachel drove down to sidney picked up some of our friends and went to troy to watch fireworks. by the time it was half over we finally found a parking spot. afterwards we went back to one my friends houses and shot off fireworks until about 12:30. i spent the nite at rachels house and once we got home we made goodie bags up the swim team that she needed for the next day. so we hit the sack about 3:00 am. i had to be up early the next morning because i was going golfing. I came home got ready and took off for lima. after golfing my score was a 62. Par is a 32, so a 62 is really good for someone who has only ever played twice. afterwards, i went over to my cousins house and swam in their pond all day and had a cook out. it was a lot of fun because i got to see a lot of my family members i havent seen in awhile. that nite i went home and went up to sidney to hang out with some of the peeps up there and we ended up going to see more fireworks, and lighting more fireworks off. that brings me to today. Today was kind of boring. Eric came and visited me today! So i was pretty psyched out that! i missed him bunches! so it was a good visit! i had to work tonite, as manager, for my first time. it went really well. a lot better than what i was expecting it to be! we were pretty steady until bout 7 o clock. then we got hit pretty hard with a $400 hour, and only 3 ppl working! we did an awesome job! after closing eric came in and stayed wit me until i was ready to leave, then he walked me out! how sweet! eric stole some chicken, but we will keep that our little secret! heheh nahh, he just took some left over chicken.its all good! after that, i took the deposit to the bank, and talked with my mom for a little bit, came down and talked to eric on the net awhile, and now i am heading to bed. big day tomorrow, another boring day of babysitting, another day of agony! haha! welp good nite everyone! -ash-

      Hey Everyone! Its been a couple of days since i last blogged, but thats because i havent been home for the last couple of days long enough to blog! Tuesday, was my first time managing at work! It went really well! At first i was kind of scared because i was working with a cook who doesnt take me very seriously and likes to cock off a lot! But that night he was really good, and actually listened to me for once! Around 7 o clock, and only 3 people working, we got pretty hard! We had a $400 hour which is really good and really busy. We made about 6 trays of chicken in one hour! thats a lot of chicken! Nothing went wrong, and i was really glad about that! Wednesday i had to babysit until 4:30 and then me and rachel went to piqua, picked up some guys and went shopping! I was supposed to take my car to be fixed with my dad, but he made plans without asking me first and got mad because i needed my car! He hasnt talked to me since! Oh well, not my loss! After shopping, we drove around, hung out with some more people, and then headed home. Friday night i had to work until close, after work i ran home showered, and headed to sidney, i stayed at a guys house and didnt go to bed until 630 am! it was insane! I was to the point i was bouncing off the walls because i was so hyper from lack of sleep, because the nite before i didnt get to sleep until 3! saturday morning i got up, hung out with some guys at the house, and then it was time for me to head home because i had to be to work at 2. I got to work, pretty boring like normal. i hate working the afternoon shifts because no one wants chicken at 2 in the afternoon! so i sat around and talked to lorynn most of the time. After work, i came home got changed, got picked up by rachel and headed to sidney. We picked up one of my close friends, ben, and headed to piqua. We went to brads house, rachels bf, and paint balled in the pouring down rain! omg was i soaked! after paint balling, laughing our butts off because one guy, andrew, kept sliding through the wet grass while running and falling about five times, we went inside! we hung out there until about 1-1:30 and decided we were all going to go to taco bell. well we got to taco bell, and they were closed! grr! so we had to go to mcdonalds! hah oh well! me and rach dropped off ben and headed home! That brings me to today! I got home about 9:30 this morning and omg was i drained! i was sooo tired! After going to bed 3 am thurs. 6:30 am fri. and 2-2:30 sat. nite, i was beat! So once i got home i hit the couch and slept until 2! I got up got on the net, got ready for work, talked to eric for a bit, and then went to work. we were pretty dead tonite! we closed at 8 and i got out of there at 5 after! I came home, took a shower, and brings me to now! sitting here being bored, so i decided to blog! eric always yells at me that i dont blog! but now look who hasnt blogged in quite awhile! not me! haha! have a good nite! -ash-
