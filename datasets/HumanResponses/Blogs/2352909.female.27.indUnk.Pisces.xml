      God morning!  Well then its monday, but its a holiday so it means one more day off work:)  But Im not feeling all that good, so for me it means another day in bed..  I have been thinking alot about what i would like to use this site for.. and Im still not sure..he..he..  But I had this strange dream last night..  THIS IS WHAT I DREAMT:   I was in a big bank and there was some money missing. And we had to keep it a secret cause no one could really know. And I had sunnglasses on, and everytime I took them of I couldnt see a thing. And woke up with this nervouse feeling in my whole body.. strange. And after I fell asleep again I dreamt I was out on a bike with some people who where supposely my friends. And we stoped by a house and one guy (a friend of mine from Thailand)came up to me and stared to kiss me. And then suddenly I could hear the voice of my exboyfriend, and he was just laughing and saying "i can se you" and i couldnt see him. Then I saw him and he was sitting on the top of a building.. a gass station (i think) and when i looked down i had no clothes on. and then suddenly im on a big field with two other girls and three children that we are taking care of. And suddenly we hear a strange noise and on of the girls says its a snake, but its not near to us so we dont need to worry. The next thing is that there are snakes all over and we have to run down the hill with the children. And as we reach the soil one of the snakes tries to bite my foot.    And then I woke up... Its really weird to remember my dreams so clearly. But when I was younger I always used to write them down. And by doing that i have learnd to remeber my dreams. But if I dont think about them I will forget them after a couple of houres..  So maybe I will use this site to share my weird dreams...hmmmm..   Anyway another day with sunshine is here, and I have to stay in bed! well, other days will come;)  have a nice day all of you!

Even tough I think my life is quit boring right now;)  And actually right now Im sick, and have been for a week.. Im about to climb the walls in my apartment cause Im so bored!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I have to stay in bed... Hard life;)  But Im getting better so hopefully I will be back at work next week. Even tough thats not my kind of fun its much better than staying in bed for a week.  And since Im singel I have no loving boyfriend to take care of me.. and that sucks but only right now when Im sick;)  well thats all for now, im climbing in to bed again.. urg!  c ya!

      Hi,  Now its May and the spring is here in Norway. Its really lovely. I must say I have been missing this season when I have been travelling in Asia.  But at the same time I also miss Thailand and having hot season all year..   Its not easy to make a choice to stay here in Norway with family or to go back to Thailand and seek adventure and other ways of living..  Im still not sure what to do, but at the moment I will be here in Norway and try to make the best of it.  I havent really used this site much yet, but if anyone wants to share travell experiences, tips to where to travell etc. please feel free!  Maria:)
