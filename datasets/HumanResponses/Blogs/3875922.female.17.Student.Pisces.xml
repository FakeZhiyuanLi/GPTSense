      i think his name was david jennings... yeah i think it was. that guy with the strong northern irish accent. it was spectacular, just even watching his mouth move... but i geuss i prefer the normal "southern" irish accent. and i know you'll slap me, AFRA... sowwy. anyway. yeah. irish guys are sexy. his starting line was "oh jesus. you really remind me of my korean ex"....... greaaaat. like i needed to know that. he had nice blue eyes. i liked the solid eye contact we had. and then went the "ohhh your japanese. ive been there. to yokohama and tokyo. the japanese are so friendly, blah blah blah" like i need to know that. nearly every bloody person has to tell me about their tales from japan.  i went there, oh it was beautiful, my girlfriend's brother's wife is japanese, OK I GET IT. SO SHUT UP  and sorry about not emailing back. my computer has.... detected "spyware" which is some infection thing. bloody annoying. hotmail or any mail server wont open! ARSE  gawd im hot. its hot. everyone is hot. rory came to ealing to see me. it was nice. his hair was floppy.  im going to japan tomorrow!!!!! FUCK im not looking forward to the travelling. bloody japan. it being 14 hours away. with a stop over at bloody vienna. what do austrians speak? german? bloody austrians. or however you spell it. i dont give a shite.  the heat makes me feel sexy. maybe its cause im listening to porn music. its great.  ok, i'll shut up  xxk

      hello.im wearing normal earrings now.  kinda hurt when i try poking the earring into my ear but ive learnt a trick. so all is good. i realised why i hadnt pierced them right up until now.  they look so tacky. i look even tackier. thats my snoby-ness talking. ive gotten used to things dangling from my ear lobes now.  got some free LP's from work today. crappy ones which look as though they've been through rough times, but they are: - Bagrock & Motorvral 1982-1987 by Kenneth and The Knutters -&nbsp; Break the Chain by Elkie Brooks - Merseymania they all serious look like a pile of wank music. but it'll be something to lookforward to listening, and add to the collection.  christina from work is nice. she used to go to nottinghill. and now goes to York, studying English. marrion is a divorced gossip. but i guess shes nice too. talks too much though barbara is great. although im a bit worried about how much she's trusting me with. for example, shes wanting me to cash up, at the end of the day! i mean, i can do it, and i dont mind doing it, but...&nbsp;precision, isnt the main word i think about when im doing any of the tasks she gives me... SHIT!  going to the tate or something tomorrow. with jonny. then&nbsp;go to the jazz festival, once again. for the millionth time.  that bloody song, tremelo blues has been stuck in my head. and im so fucked off.  i went to ken high st this morning. in such a mood. i was huffing everywhere i went. looking tired and pissed off. then i saw miss skone-roberts!!!! i kinda froze and wobbled about on the spot, not knowing what to do.... but i just ended up walking straight ahead... good work kumiko!  xxk

      OH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GOD   yesterday, went to the jazz festival, then my mum fucked off with her phone, so i had to wait for rory patiently by the entrance. we were in the front, watching this great jazz band. it was all good.   THEN.   we went to go to the other tent, then rorystop this guy called Milton who was with this guy. rory and milton are in the same music tech class. there was this guy who was next to milton, who was introduced to us by simon. SIMON!?!?!?! OH MY GOD.... and it was a spitting image of that "simon" i&nbsp;had this crush on,&nbsp;when i was&nbsp;five&nbsp;at the grange. so i asked him, then it was that simon! he was like "yeah, i was in yellow class!!!" i couldnt rememeber which&nbsp;&nbsp;class i was in, but all i rememeber was the fact that, "i bloody fancied the pants off you, and i used to always&nbsp;run after&nbsp;you when we played catchy kissy.... i even bloody included&nbsp;you into my GCSE english essay!". i was going to tell him that, but then i realised that i would've sounded like such a child-whore, fancying someone&nbsp;when i was merely&nbsp;5&nbsp;years old... so i didnt. milton was at the grange too, apparently..... who the hell is he??? havent the slightest clue... AND there arent any bloody photos from grange school in my house! theres one... and thats pretty crappy.  &nbsp;noooooooooooooooooo   since ive left the grange, ive been reunited with Uba, Simon, and Louis   christ  xxk

      as it says in the title, fucked. yes i was. literally.  i went and bought myself a pair of black "fuck me" stilletoes.  beautiful.  a bit whorish.  oh who cares.  bought some earrings. bought a stripey skirt another pair of shoes. well indian slipper things. then boughtmyself 40g's worth of columbian shrooms with jonathan.  FUCK.   i couldnt feel it until later, but..... my god.....jonathan started feeling it when we were sitting down in the eating area bench place in camden...bu i felt it when&nbsp;we got to shepherds bush green. and when i got home.... oh my god. i was completely fucked. in a good way. giggle giggle, smiley smiley. all was good. THEN my mum got back.shit shit shit. it was such a tricky moment. - a long moment really.i think i had to be in her company for about 1 hour and a half before i had to say that i was feeling "ill" and had to go to bed, which is where i am now. i still cant coherently put together a sentence, without sounding like an infant, which i cant do even when im sober, but its getting better.   i think my "fuck me" shoes are too overly&nbsp;whorish.... shit....im such a bloody slapper wanna be.... i actually want a corset though.... i think they're quite kinky  anyway. i'd better shut up  &nbsp; xxxk&nbsp;

      IM SO HAPPY so so so happy. there is a reason.  music. i soon as i put on the cd player on, it transformed me. im back to my joyful self again.  no more being pissed off... ok maybe until about 6pm. but otherwise...  &nbsp; YAY &nbsp; im free again. im back to being able to prance around frantically, dancing (like a fool) along to really really crappy music. as soon i put slade on, WOW. then it moved on to heavier stuff. metal, is, as george says, a saviour. &nbsp; seriously. how do people survive without music? or the love for music? YOU LUNATICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp; xxk

      woke up, and had a smoke in my bedroom.  satisfying.  in the early hours, i had one of those conversations with carlo again.  looks as though its going to happen.  all over again  i dont care this time round really.  everyone can fucker off.   on the other hand. i was thinking about rory.  maybe i do like him.  maybe i do get urges to go up to his skinny frame and go over and hug him.  i do like him. i really do.  just not now.  if im still in london, and if he's still interested, i would love to start a relationship with him.  although, by then, it'll probably be too late.  i just like him for being who he is. rory. i really do.  just not now. it wouldnt be fair on him.  i like far too many people. well, two guys.  but... its just not fair on him.   had dinner with mum at Okawari. a bit yucky. wasnt nice.  i should be mowing the lawn. im so lazy.   well. i'll write sooon   xxk

       me, myself, andrew, rory and jethro went on an adventure to see witchcraft at the peel, kingston.  before getting to the venue, we walked a lot.  so by the time we got there, we werent exactly jumping up and down, with an ecstacy of joy, but we got there around 8, nearly 9 ish.   the blood iron raiders played first, then witchcraft, then grand magnus   witchcraft were amazing. why dont they play my favorite song!!!! - i want you to know. i'd probably cry if they did though....   so, all was good last night. rory kept on talking to the drummer from firebird. serious conversations... all was good. all was good   i enjoyed myself.   when are they next playing!!!!! soon i hope.  go to their website:   www.witchcrafthome.com

      more and more rain.  went to the book sale at school and sung during the lesson.  carlo texted me saying that he wanted to meet up on the 20th. hmmm  alex is/has going to america.  am currently eating dried squid.  it keeps on getting caught between my teeth. grrrrr  jonathan was being an arse about the whole giving him back the £10.   look. this is what happened.  i owed rachel a tenner but when i had that £10 which was supposed to go back to rachel, rory asked me if i had a tenner. and said he'd give it back to her himself. but now, after 4 months, he hasnt.  last week, jonathan and i went to the circus, and he paid a tenner for me, which i had to pay him back for.  so as rory and jonathan are best friends, i thought it'd be easier for me to give rachel 10 pounds so jonathan can get the money off rory.  BUT NO NO NO NO NO  he said i over complicated the whole matter, ok maybe i did... but that doesnt let him say  "Rory warned me 5 days ago that you all ways pass the debts on and confuse it all. And now you have gone and done it. And you have been extremely inconsiderate to me. Rory owes andrew 130 pounds. NOw you have confised the debts which means rory owes me the tenner.Hes hardly going to pay me back straight away when he owes andrew all that money. I wont see my tenner for months and months and i need that cash"   and i love the last bit: "DONT DO IT AGAIN, accept it. you have done the wrong thing"   FOR FUCKS SAKE who the hell does he think he is! yes ok i was wrong, but "dont do it again"???????????????????   pah   i guess the culture and backgrounds we come from are far more different than just that "little bit"   xxk

      got a letter through the post, confirming that im blood group A+. it was a genuine surprise  went to kensington again. well, walked around fulham first. i was walking in a daze. its a quiet world without my walkman, blasting it out through the ear phones. i took a bus then walked to ken high st. saw nam and lola. hadnt seen nam since june last year! she was wearing a tea towel around her neck. "cool" i kinda miss her.  saw "ladykillers" what a pile of shite.  maybe it was cause i was distracted by the young couple who were sitting diagonally from me, with the boy was fingering the girl and pulling constantly.  fucks sake.  learn manners!  left sophie's present off with leo.  and i started making tracks towards home.  dropped over at the internet cafe outside south ken station, and whilst i sipped on the hot chocolate, miss badger caught my eye, posting what looked like student reports, through the letter box. she was in her jeans and trainers. something about her, that makes me sad. she is a nice, kind, generous, sweet person... i dunno.... just always looks so sad.  we love you miss badger.  plus andrew rory and jonathan are complete simpletons.  sorry, am i just re-iterating something we already know?  xxk

      ok, firstly, i had a very stressful day today. well, most of it, anyway. my mother and i had several full-on arguments, including the pulling of hair, and bruising eachother's arms and slapping each others faces. i ended up packing all my stuff into two sport bags. sad. my life was in two bags. i was that close to leaving and going somewhere, when i gave in, and gave my "mummy" a hug. what a wanker.  then i get a text from rory at about..... now ish, 8pm saying that he met ALEX!!!!! he said it was an "old friend" alex. so i presumed it was alex michaels. AND IT WAS !!!!! they met at club motherfucker!? or something. anyway. alex said, oh your the rory whos fuck buddies with phoebe!? WHAT!? whats going on!!!! seriously..... then what surprised me even more, was the fact that alex said that she was coming to richmond next year! WHAT! WHAT THE FUCK! i hope thats a silly little joke..... it would be funny if she did, end up coming though.... hahahaha. i might like it though.  oh my god. what the hell is going on!?  anyway. in my confused present state, i must be off.  and im going for drinks with dominic when he gets back from melbourne........ he's great. such a wanker. i love the way he admits it. great great great. he has a girlfriend!!! finally.... its so cute.  anyway. i better be off  xxk

      from 2 - 6 i was on a shift with chris. this guy who ive never worked with before. and anyway. it was only me and him. and  oh my god! at first, i thought "wahey" but then i was wrong. very very wrong.  george admitted that he was a moody cunt but my god, compared to chris, he would've been sunshine. what the hell was chris's problem!? he was in his fifties. dresses like he was an ex banker or something. one of those city types, but what the fuck! from 2-6 we shared roughly 20 words even though we were in the same room for most of the bloody afternoon.i mean..... maybe im over reacting here, but maybe he's got a bit of oestrogen inside him, making him feel all menopausal. or maybe he's not getting enough sex. maybe he was just born like that. fucker. even when i was polite and asked him stuff, he'd just grunt/mumble/ just look at me confusingly. what the fuck was going on! therefore, headed home at 6 in a really really really bad mood. but a bit of metallica saved me from that. brilliant. a saviour, if you like.  simon came into the bookshop today. i became really flustered.... and clumsy. as i do, am, whatever. even though i fancied him nearly 12 years ago.  im starting to think loving people is pointless. i mean, actually deeply, trully loving someone. guy-wise of course. hmmm. i just find the whole concept of actually loving someone, completely pointless. sad. but true.  the northern irish guy came in today. brought his korean girlfriend who "looked like me" but bloody hell! fuck off!  ok thats about it. oh yeah, spent loads of time on the bloody spread sheet, but still got the totals wrong after spending nearly 2 hours on it. bastards. bloody formulas.i swear =sum(??:??) is the right one, for adding cells up... bastards  xxk

      im back in london. what a huge relief. and what a bloody nightmare. got to the airport in tokyo at 8am for the 10.45am flight to vienna. the flight got delayed until 7.30pm then hopped on a 13 hour flight. then got to vienna and had to stay the night at a hotel. arrived at the hotel at 1.45am (vienna time) and had to wake up for the first flight back to london which was at 7.05am so we were at the airport at 5.30am. got to the departure lounge then i had either lost my boarding ticket or the woman at the ticket place didnt give it back to me or something, so we had to purchase another ticket all together. mum wasnt happy.  so kids, dont fly with Austrian Airlines. THEY ARE A LUMP OF HORSE MANURE  so im now exhausted.  its great to be back in london though. alex said she might go to university in the US for a year then transfer to london. yay to that.  now off to bed i go  xxk

      yes. its great. im in japan. finally. well... kinda. its bloody hot and bloody humid. not too great. the plane flight wasnt that bad. stopped over at vienna for the transfer flight.  japan is so nasty..... im starting to hate the weather and the stupid rules eg. pedestrians cannot smoke whilst walking along the street, and if they wish to smoke, they have to go to a dessignated smoking area on the street, which consists of a sign saying smoke here, with one oblong ashtray, which is about 2m long. its so crappy. plus even if i do smoke whilst walking, i have to put the stub in a ashbin thingy until i find one. so in one word, its just so tedious.  about to see koko in about.... an hour.... making me go clubbing. but im not. and she doesnt know that, but hey.... i really need a pee. i think i might have to end here and write another entry another day.  xxk
