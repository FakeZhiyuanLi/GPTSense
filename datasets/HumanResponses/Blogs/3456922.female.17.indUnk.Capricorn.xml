      i took an i.q. test the other day.... my i.q. is 144. and to add insult to injury, guess what my intellectual description is.    "YOU ARE HIGHLY GIFTED AND APPEARING TO BE A GENIUS TO MOST PEOPLE. hmmm... i APPEAR to be a genius? what does that mean? try it out. and just trivia: alber einstein had an i.q. of, like, 168 to 169. beat that. :) www.intelligencetest.com or www.iqtest.com

        BASTI! YOU N I HAVE ARGUED THIS POINT TO DEATH, HAVEN'T WE?   HAVE YOU READ: ayn rand's "atlas shrugged"? it is one of the most influential books existent in the world today. it perpetuates the philosophy of OBJECTIVISM. objectivism might strike some humanists, conformists and whatever-ists as inhuman. why? because it says human emotion is second to the power of the human mind. it means that rationality is the utmost tool to our survival. and money IS good as long as you EARN it rightfully and value that which you acquire. in fact, the book explains in great detail how a capitalistic society could thrive and succeed. it does make a lot of sense, logically, rationally, and it does appeal to the human intellect (which, to some extent,the  book implies as almost nonexistent in this world today). which is true to some level. in fact, i have thought of some representation regarding the title. atlas represents those who have the mind, power, and will to make changes in the world. atlas carries the world on his shoulders. all these years he's possessed the gift of thought and he used to make monumental things. but the parasite-infested world of non-thinking people thrive on them, cheat them, and rob them, take advantage of their mind. so the greatest power that was finally given to them by the trio of heroes in the book was the knowledge that they shouldn't accept this life and they should not give this moral sanction to the world to use them. finally, atlas realized the worth of his life, let go of the burden of the world, and ATLAS SHRUGGED. yeah yeah yeah... haha. it's a good read. it'll convince you that there is some goodness to being selfish. :)

       Astromatch?  No, seriously, astromatch.  Astrology , the single most vague yet utterly alluring quasi-science. Right up there with palmistry and handwriting analysis. Rely on the cosmos and star placements according to your time and place of birth. So much information you could take just two clicks away. One is,  choose you and your partner's sign  and two is,  click to see your astromatch !! Is this credible? Fatalistic altogether despite the counter-attack of astrologers and madame sinistras alike that "the stars serve only as guides but they do not determine what will really happen." Convenient. Sort of like saying, okay this is what your stars say but you can choose your own destiny. How many times have I compared two tabloids or newspapers together to find inherent contradictions. example:  Libra : today is the time to let go of the past and start anew. Be wary of financial dealings for it may prove to be unsuccessful. The other newspaper says:  Libra : This is the best time to invest in something, like stocks or gambling. The lucky influence of Venus will bring forth fruitful results. The statements are vague enough so that they apply to anyone. That's the beauty and nuance of it. Hah! As if I do not haunt the New Age section at the bookstore. Personally, i find astrology enjoyable. I have downloaded my birth chart (close to analysing it atrologer-style), read millions upon bagillions of love compatibility test results for me and my mate and i do subscribe to the daily horoscope on the net but seldom read them. Why? oh, it is interesting. Like my current Leo boyfriend asked, "Why do girls like astrology so much?" Oh, i said, "It is just fun to look for a guy who's supposedly compatible with you." And he asks, "well, who are your compatibles then?" I said, taurus, capricorn, virgo, and cancer (best match) but i should stay away from Aries, Gemini and  Leos . And he goes, "Oh well, i think it's a load of crap." Well said, darlin'. Here I am, Capricorn, the Seagoat, randy but dignified, cold, calculating, ambitious and a hardworker and there is my Leo who is passionate, fiery, egotistic(?), a lover of children, dramatic, warm, charismatic and is the gravitational pull for friends and admirers. So far they've gotten his qualities right but they have erred on my part. I apparently have "a bit of Sagittarius" in me. friendly, bubbly, expandible... im sorry, did i say expandible? Being born on a  cusp  and all. I am not an expert on atstological lingo, sadly. The bad thing about my destiny is I never get sided up with my alleged "compatibles." I've had a Libra once and that didn't work out too well. Now I have a wonderful Leo guy. HOwcome I never get cancer? uhmm... okay, not the disease. Cancer my best match cancer. Perhaps it is all cast in the cosmos. Ah, well, then what is in store for me and my luvvy? And I quote...   The Lion and the Seagoat are an unlikely couple, but sometimes this combination can work very well. There seems to be a karmic connection between you... Leo is ruled by the self-oriented Sun and has a natural sense pride and dignity. The Lion wants to look good to the rest of the world and will appreciate your high standards and solid, conservative nature. Your dignified manner and serious outlook often wins Leo's respect... and if Leo respects you, you can have the Big Cat  (big cat huh? interesting...)  eating out of your hand in no time! In fact, you seem to be able to handle the high-handed Lion better than most..Leo often looks on the bright side of life and can cheer you up when you have a case of the Saturnine blues. In return, your realistic and practical nature is the perfect antidote for when Leo's head gets lost in the clouds.    Because Leo is an impulsive, emotional Fire Sign and Capricorn is a practical, controlled Earth Sign, you will have to learn to respect and tolerate each other's different temperaments. Leo can scorch you with his or her unbridled enthusiasm and legendary temper tantrums, while you are just as likely to smother Leo with your pessimistic moods and old-fashioned ideas... Together, you can be a formidable team... if you have decided it is worth the effort it will take to work together.    This is not the easiest combination in the Zodiac and works best when more harmonious aspects between Moon and Ascendant exist  (again with the gibberish).  When both of you want it to work, this can be a very strong partnership. Otherwise, it might not be worth the trouble!  Ah yes, that is what the stars say... what will happen to us we shall see. many thanks to www.astrologycom.com for today's pretedermined love forecast.

       tantra   any class of Hindu or Buddhist mystical or magical writing  therapeutic.. therapy a cleansing of the soul a clearing of the mind a willful immobility of the body lax i am tending to dream tending to sleep away the fatigue swimming through a tunnel the tunnel is my mind out through my ear and back through my mouth dive i dive bottomless and dark more than lacking in direction a river flowing vaguely from sight upstream or downstream? lost in the murky shadows of confusion then a flash of color and i gaze at the figure of HIM gifted and still he is like water in a vase ready to push and break and flow how profound, i think that in the beginning and end of my memory i find you where are the rest?, i ask that time encompassing the years before you? it is gone, he said i am here, i am there again tomorrow and after i am you, all of you i wish to end this i wish to blur his image but his focus is strong and he refuses to waver this is not my exit i do not grope or grovel and i do not need you for sustenance. his grip falters, but for a millisecond i wish to destroy him and make him blend with the shadows for that is what he is and i am light and weightless. will- sheer as a camisole against sweaty skin upstream. i know now. upstream. that way is forward that is the exit i like so i plummet single beams of light at the bottom like blurred fish scales dancing i drop and hit water and wake up from a dream i jolt and move so quick i fall and the floor gives me a slap.

      I own a pair of boots that are snazzy and ultra-cool. well, to me, of course... and they're great with jeans, but slutty with skirts... the other day me and mah friend agatha went to the mall to buy books... course we didn't exactly JUST buy books. (one, because the stupid books we were looking for were sold out and two, because well, who want's to go to the mall and JUST buy books??!! no offense to those who do.) we went clothes shopping. agsy of course, bought at seventeen, yrys, and nafnaf was on sale... woohoo... and i have to mention that i saw my dream jeans but they didn't have my size!!! (insert heartbreak)... anyway, so we went to my kinda store   to just check out clothes and hopefully find some jeans to ease my broken heart. i must mention that by this time we had walked roughly 12 miles (?) exaggeration? hmmm... point being, it felt like my feet were fastly losing blood and feeling. so i got a pair of jeans and went to try it on but ohoho!! as soon as i removed my boots, i had leg cramps and my muscles seized and, well, think me crumpled up on the floor of the fitting room crying. :) seriously, i felt like i was never going to walk ever again.... oh killed feet, what have i done???!!! which brings us to the question: WHY DO GIRLS WEAR HEELS ANYWAY? why do we? huh??!! sure, they kill our feet, and reprimand me for wearing dearly beloved boots on a near-hiking trip but still. is it vanity? stupidity? or is it just that boots are plain damn sexy? sure, if i go on at this rate-- wearing my boots for long walks, and alternately vowing to burn them and vowing to wear them the next day... i sure as hell will have varicose veins by the time i hit twenty. i think sarah jessica parker said it best: "These shoes PINCH my feet... but i LOVE them."

      which is precisely where i am right now. in a state of chaos. my life is seriously falling apart. it's thoroughly unnerving. like i can't get a grip on things... today i missed phys.ed. for the nth time cos i woke up late. which is because i experienced another bout of insomnia. and i dreamt of HIM last night. Which is sad cos dreams seem to be the only place where i can INTERACT with him. pathetic. there is always a point in someone's life where they seem to lose direction. but this happening chronically? is a cause for alarm. i still haven't decided on my future path-- career-wise. still hanging in the air. plus my irresponsibility sa studies hasn't been helping at all. i never thought i'd say this but i'm a lost cause. . . suspended in space like helium balloon. somewhere i am truly gonna explode. snap. crackle. pop. like a rice crispie. sheesh.  seeking therapy, me.

      Would you try to look for me In the murky sky I'm swimming in? I'm pretending That the way your eyes Squint and stare Is a way of help Mistaking your apprehension for care. But all you're seeing Is a black pool of clouds Soon to rain And you stare down at your feet And cover your head with shield. Would you try to save me from a dense river that sinks me? I'm pretending That the way your hands Move in the water Is a way of help Thinking it desperation and need to grasp my hand. But all you're seeing is a coin you dropped at the bottom. Soon to grasp it, You smile and put the shiny thing in your pocket.

      Constricting space You and I tear at the walls for exits Losing sight of why We got here in the first place Raw feelings are suffocated By the need to breathe. A gap in the wall, you breach Climb out and leave me first Suddenly the cold air from the tear hits me like a bullet of force And I never want to leave where I am Suddenly content that where you aren't Is where I ought to be.

      I propose that eyebags be considered a new epidemic. seriously. It must be eradicated! please god, let it be eradicated. Notice the people you see everyday. Nine out of ten have the disease. I say disease because it is plaguing all of us.... with the exception of the perfect fair-skinned chinita girl from archaeo class who does not seem to be affected by lack of sleep, (worse) insomnia, stress, genetics. Heck, even actresses whom you see up close and personal are starting to catch on to the new fad. trust me, underneath all the layers upon layers of make-up there is a pair of dark circles waiting to be noticed. Strangers have come up to me and said, "Naglalakihan ang eyebags mo." That must be a cause for attention. All with due cause. In my case, I sleep a lot. in fact, I   hibernate  . That is the term for me. I also am resilient to stress of any form... yeah. But the catch is I wear make-up everyday (which, really actually hastens aging and produces wrinkles) and I sleep a lot but I sleep late. If I do sleep early, though, I don't really notice the next day if dear old eyebags have lightened. Point is, even if they do, they won't completely disappear. There is also a theory that eyebags may be genetic.  Big thanks to Mom and Dad, your daughter is a giant eyebag.   Is there any help? For my sake and for all sleepwalkers out there, I am trying out a few techniques. Pray they work. 1)  The Cucumber Connection - pipino mo mukha mo! Sliced cucmber. This soothes the eyes, yes, the famous vegetable, so cliche but apparently it is well thought of. The trick is to refrigerate it. Actually this applies to apples, used teabags, potatoes, even carrots. I suppose any fruit will do. Throw in a whole can of cocktail fruits and you got a fruit salad. The plus for this is you get to eat the leftovers. The downside is,  IT DOESN'T WORK.  2)  The cosmetic line -- works temporarily but in the end actually worstens it. Back off, Loreal. 3)  Eye surgery -  an expensive alternative to the normal herbal remedies... but if you're scared of getting butt fat injected into your eyes, then hell no, leave the nip and tuck to the desperate. that, or take a spoon and stab yourself around the eye area and try to scrape off the skin from there. ouch. before suicide, there are tips to actually lessen the melanin content under the eyes. The main mechanism that works here is water retention. When your cells are so saturated from salty foods and alcohol, the body tends to have a surplus of water. specifically in the skin. which is bad. cause you're like a walking keg. What works is: 1) Sleep with your head slightly elevated to minimize fluid retention. (2) Avoid booze and salty foods, which can cause water retention. (3) If you have allergies, take antihistamines and don't rub your eyes. (4) Remove any makeup carefully to avoid getting particles in your eyes. (5) To avoid dryness that can lead to irritation and puffiness, use a moisturizer. If nothing works and this is a chronic condition, cosmetic surgery may be your only recourse. Amen.

      Okay, well, jed might get mad at me cause im posting his life all over my blog. and this involves a bit of delicacy. If jed does find it then i'll gladly remove all our conversations etc from this blog but till then i shall spew forth... er... this isn't gossip by the way. something less harmful in degree. i can't think of a word right now. The very sad thing about that thing with jed and his girlfriend-- well they broke up. It was wierd eh parang nag-uusap lang kami before class, swapping riddles and stuff (really clever ones, some especially funny) tapos pumasok kami sa class. So we were passing notes a bit then biglang sabi niya, "OH MY GOD.." and I go like, "what?" and he goes, "My girlfriend just broke up with me." by text pa. sheesh. and he was really heartbroken. araw araw nga ngayon na makita ko siya para siyang namatayan. I asked him to share his story and i think he had it coming. He mentioned that eight times before the girl's been asking to leave him kaya lang he always asked her to stay... and she did. the ninth time didn't end the same way. hmm... wawa naman. KAYA DON'T TAKE RELATIONSHIPS FOR GRANTED. AND WHEN IT DON'T WORK, IT DON'T WORK. MAYBE SOME OTHER TIME...  And here we go to more shwammy stories bout relationships. Countdown! Me and Leoboy still on. yahoo! He even celebrated his birthday last friday. He's twenty no longer a teen. but he insists he's still "twenteen." haha.  Lalalala.... This morning I got the wierdest proposition. See the night before my former roommate olga texted me and said that this guy I once knew from the dorm (and for a short period of time was crushing on me.. bad experience) wanted my number. and olga goes like, "something's fishy... :)" and turns out she was correct. The guy's name is R**** D**** and he says good night and good morning and then a little before lunchtime he says, "can i court you?"   okay that was wierd see i haven't even seen the guy and then out of the blue he makes ligaw??! hwahhht?? it's like compressing the whole courtship process to a span of 12 hours! And so I say, "well, im sorry i have a boyfriend already." make that the shortest courtship ever. less than 10 seconds! :) Me and olga think he's just really desperate to get a girlfriend na. Liek he's been out of the game for far too long. hmmm.. and im the last resort? hehe. sheesh. Guy should get a few tips with how to get a girl. I sort of feel like I was approached with a pick-up line and it blew up in his face. See, it was totally out of line, out of context, totally unimaginative, and out of the blue. not the right strategy to ask a person to be your girlfriend.
