      So, I went on the Junior Trip Monday morning and it was AMAZING *tiring though* I had a lot of fun with my friends, but even so, I cried once.  I was listening to 3 doors down and it was "When I'm Gone" and "Here Without You" and it just made me cry because I was thinking that he's in NY and then he'll get back and then on Thursday he's graduating. GRADUATING... And even if things work out and God leads me to BBC, that's still a WHOLE year without him. a year... so that's where "When I'm Gone" depressed me.  It was all good though, because no one noticed me crying...   Still not sure I wanted to know.   Laterdays Ruth

      Well, I didn't really have the opportunity to think of Kenneth today, as Jarret, Jen, Kendall, Zach, and my family went on the boat.  But when we left, I thought about the fact that they're gone today.  NYC. Woohoo, and then I thought about us being in DC for 3 days!!!!!! So the depressed moment was only a second or two. Not so bad.  Not sure I actually wanted to know.  Later Days  Ruth

      Today I was assaulted by a)sleepiness, b)missing Kenneth*, c) three tests (Bible, Spanish and English).  And were it not for b, I probably wouldn't have been so miserable.  I am completely used to being tired...SCHOOL... and tests that I forget about don't surprise me.  But this whole unsureness about Kenneth is driving me up the wall and I was irritable today and I didn't mean to be. *If I offended anyone today, then I most certainly apologize* Thank heavens I have a friend like Steph to listen to me and completely concur with how I feel.  I love it that she understands what I'm going through and will talk about it with me, or if necessary *not nesecary* not talk at all, and just leave me to my thoughts.  Steph, Carla and Holly have been lifesavers throughout this whole thing, and I owe much of my sanity in the last week to their lovingkindness.  Thanks guys, I love you much   You know, I  always  wanted to know who I was supposed to marry.   ALWAYS . But now that I think God's telling me, the thoughts that pervade my mind are "Is this really God?", "Is this my imagination, or what I want?" OR, WORSE, "Is this Satan trying to distract me from how close God and I are becoming?" ...I'm not so sure I actually wanted to know after all.  Keep me in your prayers  Ruth
