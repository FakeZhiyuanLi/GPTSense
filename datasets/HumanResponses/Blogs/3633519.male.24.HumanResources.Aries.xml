      I was feeling out dated reading everybody's latest on blogs. It was like you guys were all driving big body benzes while I was whippin a busted El Camino. Kinda forced me to step up my game. Stay tuned for more words on Spoken Blurred.

      So I get to do my first mini-set this weekend at the brecht forum.  It's for a organization of South Asian activists that are in town from all over the county. I'm housing two girls at the apartment which, in hind-sight, was an unnecessary stress on my relationship. One chick was really dope though, indian and Chilena and she spoke spanish. I tried reaching Juancho because apparently they know each other. Hopefully, I'll put in a better performance this week. Lately, I've been so focused on putting new shit out there that I haven't emphasized my performance enough. I'm trying to step that up a notch too. Any suggestions?

      So thanx to OB I got to do 2 fundraisers for No RNC Video. The first at Bowery and the latter at the Nuyo. As a result they were able to raise 500 duckets. It was my first time hearing Papoleto, and let me tell you this man is one of the founders of this shit for a reason.  Being my own tuffest critic my performances on Sunday sucked but I eeked by and for whatever cool points I lost to myself the new work was well received. I've been on a kick trying to do some stuff outside of my usual style... not biting... neva that..... Just lookin to expand the repetoire. I pulled out a short piece from last year that never got any mic time and I was happy with it.  going to 13 and acentos this week then doing a benefit for the Youth Solidarity Summer on saturday at the Brecht Forum... my first paid feature! I'm really psyched. Lookin forward to the stories from the nats and plannin to tag along next year so I can get a good listen to how North Cacallaca was in first place after the first night?!? Rice and Peace to my peeples. Raj

      GOOD NEWS, my people, I bring you good news. I bring you THE news. Not not new news or old news, but it's fuckin relevant. When you hear the news you might even say you knew it would happen, but not because you heard it on channels 5, 9 or 11. You can't even get this news on CNN. This is fresh news and you heard it here, first. Hot off the press exclusive, this news scoops like ice cream and I'm so excited I'm not even sure I'm ready to share it. So you ready for the news? I got a blog.
