       Whee... it's Day 2 and nothing much has happened really. I STILL can't find my stupid book that I need to return to the library, and I don't want to get another book until I return that book, but I  have  to get a book on the Olympics otherwise I may not have enough sources for my article. I've been working on it for a little while and now I think that it's going to end up being too long, but we shall see. It is, after all, a features article  and  it  is  the history of the Olympics, and there's an awful lot of info on the Olympics. Maybe I should start some more research on that other article I have to write, the one about   urlLink  www.workintexas.com    That one will be kind of boring, just informational and what not. I cleaned my room a little bit today and now it's not as bad as before, but it's still pretty bad. Lauren is also still not answering her damn phone, and I need that freakin' book because I believe that I left it at her house. OMG, I just saw that new "Amish in the City" show and it's pretty good. It's interesting how different and yet similar the Amish are and the way the people act around them at first. The people were actually quite rude. I'm also looking forward to seeing "America's Next Top Model." I like that show because it gives you a chance to see how truly hard it is to be a model and what they have to go through to become one. Also, you get to see that the girls are real people and aren't all a bunch of anorexic wimps who cry over the smallest things. Well, every once in a while there'll be an annoying chick like that. But most of the time the winners truly deserve it. So yeah... that's some of the TV that UPN is good for, aside from Frasier, Just Shoot Me, and Dharma &amp; Greg. Time for another Fudge Round! Wheee! Thank you Little Debbie!

        Okay well this is the first entry of my blog. I might get a different blog if I can find it. This one seems rather plain, but we shall see in time. Today all I really did was go to the stables at Willow Glen Equestrian Center and I signed up for classes to begin in August. It was  really  awkward because the girls were all in the office (the arena was flooded so they couldn't practice) and I'm assuming that they all know each other and are friends so I was like "fresh meat" being the new kid. As soon as we walked in the chit-chat stopped and the staring began. It was so wierd because my mom was talking to Shea so the rest of them just sat there staring at and, most likely, judging, me. So needless to say it wasn't the warmest welcome. Then I copied some papers for an article I'm writing on the Olympics that's due on Tuesday so I should really go and work on that now. Ciao!      Oh sorta P.S. I also got online and started searching for things to put on my t-shirt that I'm making so here's a list of my favorites...     Where there is no trust there is no love  Let the dead bury their dead  After a storm comes a calm  As soon as a man is born he begins to die  Beauty is only skin deep  Better die with honor than live with shame  Dead men tell no tales  Every bird loves to hear himself sing  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread  Ignorance is bliss  Life is just a bowl of cherries  Live and let live  Love is blind  Nothing is certain but death and taxes  The female of the species is more deadly than the male  Variety is the spice of life  When the ear will not listen, the heart escapes sorrow  Do not remove a fly from your friend's head with a hatchet  He who rides a tiger is afraid to dismount  A diamond with a flaw is preferable to a common stone with none

       Well, today has been anything but productive. All I've done was sat around in Newspaper, got a few more quotes from people, spent an hour asking people to buy ads (which none of them did), and bought a lovely black and white scarf from this one store to be used as a belt. And now I have to add more quotes and kind of rewrite my articles. Although I did get a few leads, I was still kind of disapointed that I didn't sell any ads. One girl from the Student Council gave me some useful quotes and for some odd reason I almost had some sort of nervous breakdown. It was really wierd... well last night the lady at Copperfield Books was kinda scary. She asked if we printed the book list and I said "well we could include that in your ad..." and she said "That's not what I'm asking. I SAID do you print the booklist in your newspaper?" She said kind of loudly as if I'm some kind of idiot. But I do know for a fact that the X-Treme Hair design place will buy an ad and that the Shear Sophisticates will most likely want to buy an ad tomorow, too. Oh crap I have the hiccups. I hate the hiccups, and yet I love them. One final thing before I go- have you ever been awoken in teh middle of the night by two cats in a fight outside your window? Well I was last night and let me tell you that is the CREEPIEST sound to hear at night. At first there was a *thump* which initially woke me. Then, half asleep mind you, I hear this eerie screaming sound followed by a hiss. Of course, I'm like "Oh my god there's some sort of demon out my window." But then I heard another hiss followed by a yowl and then it hit me- cats. *Shudder* oh they can burn in hell for all I care. Actually, I believe that's where they end up since all dogs go to heaven.

       Woohoo! Today I sold 2 more ads with possibilities of 2 more tomorow! Whee! Only bad thing is my efforts aren't enough to get out a whole issue. We need to make $1,500 in order to put out the first issue and we need the money by Friday. But never the less, that makes 3 sold by me, and maybe 5 tomorow. I still have to check out Bailey's in the morning and the Gulf Coast Park 'N Sell place around 9 a.m.  And  tonight I'm going to try and sell an ad at Copperfield Books. Plus Muzzie's will most likely buy one on Saturday. Well maybe not "most likely" but there's a good chance. And I already know of certain places that will buy at certain times. Oh wait, I'm also going to Show Stoppers tomorow. The lady there seemed really interested in buying an ad. She was nice. Who knows, maybe the psychic down the street will want to buy one, too. That would be awesome. Oh, another thing that happened today- my other Olympics article was too long and Nicole decided that she wants me to write a new article with a totally new angle. Fortunately my information was so good in the other article that she's still going to try and use it by putting text boxes in the newspaper. So all my hard work didn't completely go to waste. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that yesterday I sold an ad to Combat Zone. Or did I put that in my last post? I must have because I didn't come home beefore I sold the ad. Hmm, I'm surprised I forgot. Oh well, that's me for you. Which reminds me, so that I don't forget, I should probably write all the stuff I have to do down in my planner. I love my planner. It's got all this neat handy dandy stuff in the back, like a map and a ruler. It's very nifty. Not to mention that I decorated the cover of it myself with duct tape, red tape, a Vans sticker, a horse picture, a photo from camp and a thing that says "Rule #385- Never pick nose past the knuckle." A life lesson well learned.

       Hello again. Let's see... well yesterday I really didn't do very much, but today I finally got my articles turned in, both the one on the Olympics and the one on WorkInTexas.com. I think that they both turned out pretty good. I'm hoping that my Olympics article will be a front page article. Here's hoping! I also went around after Newspaper camp selling ads and I actually sold an ad to this place called Combat Zone. The guy there had an ad already made up for me and everything. It was great! So I'm hoping that I have a year long customer with him. I also got a few good leads on the other places I visited that only buy around Christmas time or September. So that's why I'm excited to go out and sell more ads! Also, if anyone does actually read this and you know me personally then check this out:      GARAGE SALE ON SAT. AUGUST 7 @ THE OAKWOOD GLEN M.U.D. BUILDING 24 (RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE WATER TOWER) FROM 10 AM TO 3 PM!    PLEASE COME AND SUPPORT THE NEWSPAPER!      Oh and i also got a fortune cookie today at Chinese Wok that said:     If at first you do succeed, try not to look astonished.        So I thought that was cool especially after selling my first ad.

       I'm so glad that I didn't have to go to church this morning! I mean, don't get me wrong, I love God and Jesus and all those guys, but the sermon today was on homosexuality (and I'm not crazy about the High School service, either). So I would have had to suffer through an hour and a half of "Being gay is a sin and don't do it! Blah blah blah..." (Ken is an extraordinarily boring speaker sometimes) but fortunately when my dad heard what the sermon was about he decided he didn't want to go. The only bad thing is I got up, took a shower, and then put on shoes. I don't put on shoes unless I'm going somewhere, so here I am WEARING SHOES with nowhere to wear them to! I was so mad. I do not enjoy wearing shoes. Sarah spent the night last night and that was fun. We watched "The Missing." I liked it but sarah didn't, then again we've never had the same taste in movies. She likes "Eurotrip" (*shudder*) whereas I'm a fan of more LOTR kinda stuff. And then we went swimming and there was this giant spider. I hate those spiders! They're  always  getting into our pool at night! One even bit my dad and it had babies on it's back. It was actually kinda neat. Snakes I don't mind. I'm in a painting mood. Hmm. I'll just go to   urlLink  www.isketch.com     and play online pictionary against other people. I love that game, it's so awesome! OMG I am SO close to finishing my article it's not even funny. It's 3 pages long and I still have another article to write tonight, but I intend to make that one shorter. Here's the title for my Olympics article-       Streaking: an Olympic event?       So that really just about covers it. Tata!
