      If ever there was a film made to fit into the mould of what Cool (Shite) on the Tube is all about for me, then that film is Takashi Miike's  Full Metal Yakuza .  This movie brought together a room full of testosterone, topped off by a smattering of eostrogen, in a way  House of the Dead  could only dream about.  There was applause.  There was collective gasping.  You know a film has ensnared its viewers when they all gasp as one, and gasp we did at the inventiveness of the plot; the outrageousness of the mad scientist; the bondage kidnap, and the (pre) Kill Bill  style blood fountains.  This film had everything you can only normally get from several shots of tequila, but without the annoying bit when you wake up the next morning.    I was already a fan of Takashi Miike's work, but  Full Metal Yakuza  has solidified my opinion of the man.  He is not just a fantastic filmmaker - he is, for all accounts and purposes, a cinematic genius.  Please Bruce, can we have some more (like this)?  Perhaps we could have a showing of  Ichi the Killer ... I'm sure not everyone has experienced that film.    One last thing -  Bomberman  just aint doin' it for me.  I reckon we should get some series that none of us has seen, or something that's way cool, and watch it sequentially each week as a lead in to the main event.  Thoughts anyone?

      When I think of  Full Metal Yakuza  words like, holy, fucking and shit come to my mind.  That movie has gone directly to my most loved list along with Monty Python and the Holy Grail (and Lif of Brian), 2001, Brazil, (that movie I saw late at night on SBS, ask me about it perhaps you know the name), Go to Hell (brilliant Aussie flick), Hercules Returns, oh and shit I forget the rest.  It fits right in.  Movies like  Full Metal Yakuza  really show why the Monty Python is really popular in Japan.  The humor is subtle yet in your face at the same time.  Totally ridciculous. How the main actor kept a straight face prancing around like a ninny to shield bullets while knocking peoples heads off with his bare fists is a testament to the Japanese ability to control their facial expressions.  Anyway I am not going to give to much away as it is definately one of those movies where not knowing what is going to happen next is a real bonus.  If you have ever livid in Japan, know  a bit about Japanese culture, love live action manga, can stand a bit of low level gore and bad special effects, and love the ridiculous humor of Monty Python and their ilk then this movie is a must see.  I just wish I knew Japanese language better so I didn't have to read the subtitles.  I am sure there was a lot of subtle Japanese humour throughout the flic that I just plain missed.  Anyway...a fucking brilliant start to my years (cool) shit on the tube nights.  I'm going to be bold and give it:   10/10 transplanted apendages

      Let me be the first to say that we now have a new catchphrase with which to amuse in times of great personal crisis - or after having seen a real stinker of a movie (you know, like  Dreamcatcher )... it goes like this:    Y'know, it could have been worse... it could have been  House of the Fkn DEAD!!!     So thank you Bruce, and to the gothic girl in the corner who had the common sense to leave before the end, and the Toonster for learnin' me that salt on watermelon can actually work.

       Lost in Translation ?  Well, I wrote a huge long review, but then scrapped it simply to say this:  Coppola has created an excellent piece of Cinema that does justice to both the Hollywood and Japanese heritage of film making.  Her snapshot on life, populated with beautifully shot scenes and sparsely populated dialogue, is simply fantastic.  Any fan of classic Japanese cinema will automatically recognize many devices that have become hallmarks of the genre.  absolutely nothing was lost in this translation.  Well worth watching, even if it is just for the small titty scence.  For once I am going to not dwell on the odd points and give this one:  8.5/10 udon noodles

      Thinking aloud about   Lost in Translation       I really enjoyed this movie. Something hit home with the idea of being "lost." I read the  urlLink interview  with Sofia Coppola (director) and think she knew exactly what she wanted to achieve and achieved it - particularly with the mood of the film and the relationship between the two leading characters.   When she was discussing her choice of using film (as opposed to more techy methods) to make the movie, Coppola said "(Film)... has the nostalgic and romantic feeling of the past; that's how I remember things, through film and photos. Film gives a little bit of a distance, which feels more like a memory to me." That was something I'd noticed about the movie that appealed to me - the washed-out colouring and the music seemed to be a bit faded.     I thought the relationship between Charlotte and Bob was interesting because it reminded me of how random life is. I think humans are like a colony of ants, running into familiar strangers other again and again.   Coppola on the relationship between Bob and Charlotte: "It's supposed to be romantic but on the edge. Those relationships you have in real life - a little bit more than friends but not an actual romance. They get each other and it's flirtatious. They both know it's not going to go anywhere. To me, it's pretty un-sexual between them - innocent and romantic, and a friendship."  What can I say? She sums their relationship up so well.  The sense of humour in this movie really appealed to me. I think because it was different to the usual movie humour, because the funny things were more unpredictable than usual. It felt a bit like the banal things you laugh at in real life.   The only part that didn't quite fit was when Bob slept with the woman in red. I'm not sure what was going on there...?   Eight out of ten choc-mint-choc-tops.   Now, I'm going to rush out and see  The Virgin Suicides.

      This week Thursday, then we will goto Tuesdays...  If we all want to see a film on cheap-arse Tuesday.. we can go as a group. Could be more fun like that :-)  See my late email about this weeks details....  To Infinity and below (Well we all can't over-achieve like Buzz)!

      So what is the verdict?  Tuesday?  My vote is Tuesday.  Yes, lets make it Tuesday.  Only problem with Tuesday is that Tuesday is cheap Tuesday movie night at V********. Then again can any of us actually afford to go to the movies on Tuesday?  How many times can I say Tuesday? Tuesday?

      I second a Tuesday rather than Thursday.  "Uncle Daryl's Chop Shop", a prequel to last year's pub-theatre production "BGN7250", may be on every Thursday night starting towards the end of this month.  Quinny is the title character and I will be appearing in one episode as "Officer Perry", so perhaps we can have Cool Shite on the Tube Tuesdays, and then Cool Shite on the Stage Thursdays!  You may heckle, but not too much or we'll all cry, sensitive thesps that we are.  Hearing you on the anime thing - it's good to have something on we can cheerily talk over.

       The Eye  was a fun film, and it even unnerved me a little - and this was compounded by seeing a UFO on the way home with Quinny and Edan.  Yes, a UFO.  Over Launceston.  It wobbled and was orange.  Anyhow, a nice effort from The Pang Brothers, but  The Mothman Prophecies  still reigns supreme in my, uh... eye... for sheer creep factor and all out atmosphere.  Though I don't like to take off my glasses at night now.

      THE EYE!!!!  I thought this was a cool movie from Hong Kong / Thailand. I haven't watched a film that gave me chills like that in ages. It did have some pacing problems, and the end explosion was alittle over done (nuclear holocast like...) but the effects where very cool.Overall the movie was nothing new, and had heaps of little problems you could pick on all day, but I like it all the same.  This weeks film is: The Bunker.  I personally have seen this flick before and really liked it. Mr Lauchlin is suppling to disc this week. To get the low down goto:  urlLink IMDB .

       Lost in Translation  is a film that continues to linger with me, like the fleeting images of a half-remembered dream that kind of meant something at the time, but now, in the harsh mid-morning glare, seems less important in its  meaning  and more important that it's been remembered at all.  Now, that was one big-ass muddle of a metaphor, but that's kind of a meta-metaphor for the film itself.   Lost in Translation  slides into one scene and the next with an effortless grace.  There's no particular rhyme or reason to the randomness of hotel inhabitation.  Empty hallways full of doors, behind each one a story, and these stories collide - in the early hours of the morning, in the bar towards midnight, in the pool during aqua-aerobics, and in the foyer as people come and go, flickering between social networks and nodes.  This is the hell of jet-lag that allows people the kind of insight into others afforded usually only by late night drunken ramblings - but hellish because the only thing making it possible is the confused workings of an internal body clock.    The awkward but immediately intimate relationship that springs up between Charlotte (Johansson) and Bob (Murray) is a rewarding bond for both characters and audience.  We see the delight of a young girl mirrored in Bob's reflective behaviour.  Age is an irrelevence in their friendship - they are simply two people surrounded by a culture too bizarre and too fast-moving, united in their mutual transitory aloneness.  Even in the heart of Tokyo, people need to connect.   Lost in Translation  shows a spark of a connection, something lost in Bob's by-the-dots marriage and Charlotte's by-the-way-I-love-you-seeya same.  The final scene of the film is an achingly beautiful montage of city streets as Bob exits the city on his way to the airport.  It reminded me of my own travels abroad - the sense that I must capture these final moments in this place because once I leave, I will only carry these places and the people I've met in my heart and mind.   Lost in Translation  found its heart in my own, and I will continue to cherish this film experience for a long time to come.

      Lost in translation was very cool. It captured what I think I would feel like in Japan after all the shopping and general initial excitment runs out. But that being said, I would try to get over it and have more fun. I would call this a light depressing film that gives a some hope for the end user (ho no, nerd speak). Can't comment much more than that. I think I will got and see it in the cinema if it comes out here.

      Hi Fold,  I am hear to preach the values of cleanlyness (with bad spelling). It has come to my attention over the last weeks of "da COOL shite on the TUBULAR" that people forget about the poor drudges that must clean the pigstye afterwards. Can we all be frightful helpfull and pick up after thyselves when vaccating the premises.  In simple jargon. Pick up your shit afterwards and put it in the bin and put the cup/glasses next to the sink to be washed up. I seem to trip over glasses every Wed morning. So be darlings and help the Bruce out... he needs it!  End Transmission...

      The Bunker,  Cool and a little different. Though I didn't get to watch it with everyone else as I was doing work, I remember bits and pieces from when I did watch it. One thing I really liked is that they didn't put on stupid bad German accents. They were English actors playing Germans so there really wasn't any need to do it. We all knew they were meant to be German. I also liked the toned down colour in it. It was a pitty I could get the DVD out as the gun fire and some of the audio sounds great in 5.1 DD.   Hoped all enjoyed the movie, next week is: Battlestar Galatica The Movie. This is actually new, a remake of sorts made last year for sci-fi channel in USA. The trailers I have seen look really cool.  Also remember Flauch in your day to day saftey at the work place... an unseamlly acident is just waiting on a forklift to get you.

      I'd like to see some more Cities of gold, just for the nostalgia. I think Thoen has the first episode, I don't know if he managed to obtain any more.  Speaking of which,  Bruce, can you put comments on this site so we can keep the blog less of a discussion and more for reviews/praise/muck/news etc, and use the comments for discussion and follow up.

       Cities of Gold ....?  Is anyone else keen to watch an episode of Cities of Gold for a Cool Shite night? I was having a reminisce about it the other day and would love to watch it to see if it's really as good as I remember. Do they have copies at Blockbuster or something? I had a brief look on the internet to try & find a copy -  urlLink this guy  is selling all 39 episodes if anyone's tempted.   urlLink This site  reckons there was going to be a sequel made, but it was stopped due to lack of funding.

      I made it onto the Blog!  I get to add my two cents! Bit of a blast from the past those Transformers.  I still say Voltron was better. Battlestar Glactica was actually pretty cool, I am very gald we decided to save the second half for next week, I needed to go to bed. Will try to bring Cities of Gold next week too, but no promises. Ahhh I love reliving my childhood tv

       .    I have left my first mark on this blog - you all belongs to Samael now - mwah ha haha harr *evil laugh*  Pfshawwwww - Don't get married for money.  Get married for the settlement monies.  I did so enjoy Intolerable Cruelty.  It puts the hate into love hate relationships and that if you marry someone for her looks and her titties - she gonna nail your ass!!! and take all that money to shake her expensive booty at you coz u da sucka.  The train guy got lucky.  I don't understand train fascination.  Actually.  Fascination - I don't understand it.  It all comes down to if you have a good Lawyer you can take a guy to the cleaners.  You can also have them nullified.  Moral.  Lawyers have very shiny teeth and lots of money.  You can make lots of money and then get shiny teeth.  My motto:  Don't get married for the money - get married for the luv - then nail his ass ^_^  It reminds me of that episode in Friends where they have their "back ups" for marriage.  I think that arrangement is nice for people.  Getting married to your back up at 85 would be sweet.  Okies, enough of the babble - Sooki-Monster is on the loose - WAAHCHOUT!!!! I'M COMING STRAIGHT FOR YOU!!!!   urlLink Purple Pussy   Be warned.  Contains Tampons.

      I was watching a dirty harry movie on win tonight and went to imdb to look at some reviews... I tend to do that. Anyway I found the most convoluted, egotistical, all over the shop bit of text I have read in a long while. So with out further delay:  urlLink The Link .  Ok, I figured it out after a bit of net searching.. this guy fancies himself a poet. Fair enough, but not really useful for people wanting to learn something about the movie. I almost think we can have a Christopher Mulrooney review a week. To check out his full body of work on IMDB goto  urlLink here .   Sorry I know this really isn't something to do with cool shite, but I couldn't help sharing.

      I was really impressed by the first half of  Battlestar Galactica .  As fondly as I remember the original series, it is still a hokey foray into the sachharine cringeworthiness of early 80's television, replete with bad hair, BIG hair, and clunky recycled stock footage.  BG Next Gen has the kind of grit befitting a show about a civilisation at war and is reminiscent of  Space: Above and Beyond  which was a crap title for a rather excellent "war in space" show that lasted only one season.  It lasted only one season because it was intelligent and presented complex "shades of grey" characters pushed to their limits in dire circumstance, rather like BG.  Looking forward to the second half tonight.  I hope lots of stuff blows up real good!  And lots of people make the sex with "Number Six", so named so we can laugh at Kiwis.  ADDENDUM: Did anyone catch our Academy Award winning animated short,  Harvie Krumpet  on SBS last night?  What a darkly delightful meditation on life set against the backdrop of impending doom!  Carpe Diem!

      Well the big move is on at Batten St. So come and enjoy our last cool shite night in the middle of the city. To celerate, bring beer, champers, or whatever. We have heaps of room and I am doing a tip run the next day.  Also the movie this week is  urlLink Millennium Actress . By Satori Kon, the director behind Pefect Blue. I love this movie so much, you all need to see it!  Also we will have more Red VS Blue and maybe I might put on Invader Zim...

      This weeks viewing of Pirates of the Caribbean reminded me how much I enjoyed this adventure film. I don't think they could have casted it any better. My only sore point in the film is: why did the pirates give a shit if she tossed the coin over board. They can go underwater anyway, why not just go get it?... and also the over the top music, as per Jerry Bruckhimeir (spelling) usual was a bit much in some places.  It was also good to watch Trigun again and Mini-patos. I realised that mini-patos where boring for some people, but you asked for it, so I gave it to you.  Next week hopefully was will have Dead or Alive ( urlLink IMDB ). The tagline: WARNING: This motion picture contains explicit portrayals of violence; sex; violent sex; sexual violence; clowns and violent scenes of violent excess, which are definitely not suitable for all audiences.   I also have dead or alive 2 ready to watch :-)

      Volcano High  I personally really enjoyed this completely over the top film from South Koera. So much action, style and wackiness I just had to make everyone watch it. What did everyone else think? I really like the main actor's facial expressions, he could easily pull off many silly anime characters (Vash, GTO, etc). I want to see more film like this from other asian countries. I am glad to see that films other than just Hong Kong action/comedies are now becoming available. The new wave of asian cinema is certainly here and I am loving it!  The Tenacious D shorts... Ummmm.... I think I had to keep laughing to stop myself from throwing up. Not for the sane of mind, or really the insane either. Fun, but maybe not again (for me anyway). Thanks for Bron for elightening us, and setting a new low level to try to beat.   Next week is still up in the air as to what we are going to watch. Subway is one suggestion, Dead & Alive might have finished by then too. Any suggestion, give me an email and/or post it on the blog.

      Sunday was long... maybe a bit longer for others who had an excellent time at a certain someones birthday bash. Anyway, Subway was ... interesting. I couldn't remember much about it so I felt like I was coming in fresh. I found the characters and the acting a little dry. There wasn't a huge range of emotions in the actors, even thou some of the dialogue could have done with some. I must say that Subway is so far my lest faviourte Luc Besson film  DOOM!   We all love ZIM! And you will all love me when I buy the DVD from amazon when it comes out on the 11th of May.  As most of you piked either before coming or after coming... Frank, Lauch and I watched Matchstick men. I found it to be a really nice and interesting film. I must have been tired because I didn't try to work out the plot, just went with the ride. It was a good ride too.  Next week I am not sure what we should watch, suggestion please.

      Cool Shite on a Sunday... different but good!  I loved getting to watch the first episode of the 80's Astro Boy, it was like stepping back in time...  I want more!  I saw an ad for the new one, his voice is very different - way too deep. I didn't mind Subway, interesting enough, though a little odd... why do they live in the subway?  How do they not get found?  Christopher Lambert's blond hair redeemed him for me.  Very 80's but I wasn't bored. And lots more zim, a 'zim a thon' if you will - awesome!!!

      OMB.................... Mini Moose is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesomely cute and cute and cute and cute.  Well, now you are all doomy doomy doomed to wonder what the hell I am on about because you didn't show up last week.  But that's ok.  We can see Mini Moose next time for those who missed out in all his cute, doomy mega mooseness.  *Invader Zim*  I love this show.  It's my favourite show.  I must make a Gir suit one day.  The puppy costume... with the giant zipper and cute gian black stitching.  Kill Bill 2 is our adventure this Tuesday for the 6,30 pm session.  Please check the date of this post otherwise there could be confusion, embarassment and lonliness when you rock up to the cinema on the wrong day.  This is not exclusive invite only... well sorta.... but you can bring a friend so long as they don't talk through the movie otherwise I will take them ALL ON by opening a big can of woop ass.  Not to be confused with a can of baked beans.  That would be called "Poop ass" can.....  Never mind.  A pair of Italian boobies might be nice.  They don't often need bras in movies - noticibly because they are neked.  Oh, they're not for me - they're for my cats... one each....  Don't forget to like the mini moose in anticipation.

      Well, I didn't hate it, and it had Kate Beckinsale in it.  So  Van Helsing  won me over quite easily with its feckless charm and overall silliness.  The horse-drawn carriage chase was off da hook!  One criticism I would throw at it is that the "light bomb" thing had already been done in  Blade II .  It was stupid in that film, and merely derivative in this one.  I knew what it would be for as soon as it was mentioned in the M from James Bond ripoff scene.  And that's really all that needs to be said.  Loopy with no pretensions to be anything but a piece of fluff entertainment,  Van Helsing  rates 3.5 sharp cutting balls out of 5.

      New Template and other stuff.  Since Blogger has upgraded with user profiles and its own comment system I have upgraded the template to one that uses these features.  The only people who can post a comment are us, unless we get an outpouring of people who also want to post comments.  Cool huh?!?

      Van Helsing was as expected cheezy adventure flick with just enough class to pull it off. Not my faviourte adventure flick or anywhere close to it, but I did enjoy it. I though some of the camera (cg camera) work was really cool. A lot of the sets were interesting and the plot overall was entertaining. My only issue was really the count and his vam-girls. Over all they really suxed. I thought Dracula could have either been better of a different actor. The girls just needed better directing. I know they where trying for the old style scream and laugh because we are in a "horror" styled flick, but it was just stupid for the most part. Overall fun to watch with the brain switched off... trying to get anymore out of would cause brain tumors.  Was it just me or did you also get the memories of original Star Wars thought out in the respect of how some scenes where shot. Example Hugh and Kate grabing each other and swinging of a ledge and the burning of the body (I wont say who for all that haven't seen it) at the end.  Anyway to see Kate's leather clad arse on film again, it was well worth it :-)

       Dead or Alive , let me count the ways in which I loved thee:  Your strangely charming graveyard, out in the mud; Your black-clad villain,  doing right by your little bro'; Your tacked-on familial dramas to humanise your characters; Your colourful underworld figures; Your  unflinching depiction of bodily fluids; The motherfuckin' raddest ending to a movie ever.  I don't think I'll ever see a movie more radder than thee.

      The wait was worth it, Dead or Alive blow my mind. How cool can a movie get?! I was a little stumped at the beginning, about half way though I came to the understanding to let it be and rebel in it's abstraction. Then the end came and the biggest cheer at a cool shite night since the bionic wang (from full metal yakuza) filled our lounge room. How cool was that ending. Every time I see a Miike film, I fall more in love with his directing and script writing skill. Give me more!.. The trilogy is getting release (dead or alive) in Oz next month. I might be having to spend money I don't have to watch it. Ho the joy, the pain and the absolute madness. I would love to put this on at film society just to completely blow the minds of the older members of the audence.   Well enough praise, our next film is Jersey Girl. It should be interesting, like all Kevin Smith films.

      Shaun of the Dead,  How funny was that. Britsh comedy at its best. I am glad we didn't watch Jersey Girl and went for this bonza film. I just wish it was out for everyone out there to enjoy.

      Shrek 2 - The Big Green Dude...  So after emailing everyone about going to shrek 2, only Sooki, Alan (Brother) and I went. I enjoyed it. Nice animation and lots of fun getting all the movies references. The story was a bit predictable and more adult and modern like, but who cares when it just a fun ride.  So next week, what are we going to watch? I was going to suggest Spiderman 2, but I figure you will all have seen it before Tuesday.  Suggestions welcome

      Watched a very cool Zombie/Samurai/Yakuza/Action flick last night called Versus.  I feel that this is a definate for a Tuesday night showing. It is voilent, but so over the top so that it is really funny with very cool camera work to boot.  What people think about watching it this Tuesday?
