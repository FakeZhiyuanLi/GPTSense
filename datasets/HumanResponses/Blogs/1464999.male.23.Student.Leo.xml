       So, just about 4 hours left in Auckland... It's been raining on and off here, but that hasn't stopped me from wearing shorts and sandals. Met a guy called Glen this morning that went to UWO 3 years ago and took computer science. That makes 4 people here that knew what U.W.O. on my hat stands for.


Threw out my shoes today. Gave away a whole bunch of toiletries and food so I could make room in my pack for my sleeping bag. Will be a long flight home. Have had a blast. Will try to get my pictures online before my extended away at camp.

       'So it has been a while. What have I done lately? Well I was in Wellington for two nights. Had some excellent meals with my adoptive flatmates and got to see a bit of the nightlife. Must again stress how odd it is to only have 3 or 4 television channels.

After that I took the night bus from Wellington to Auckland which is 12 hours long. It's really not that bad if you manage to sleep through the whole trip. Got off the bus and sat on a bench for 2 hours at 6am in wait for a tour bus which would take me further north to Paihaia (can't spell it properly at the moment). Stayed there for two nights. Met 5 Canadians in the hostel. We had a great time showing off our patriotism as they had brought Canadian flags along with them. I was elected to wear one as a cape due to my height.

Went on a sailing tour of the Bay of Islands with a Canadian captain hailing from Victoria. Mike was his name. If you're ever in Paihaia, look him up. He's quite personable. On the 6-7 hour trip, we got to see many baby penguins swimming in the water (no pictures as they're too fast), and watched dolphins play alongside the yacht for some time. I managed to get some pictures of them as well but framing dolphins at sea can be quite difficult. I'm sure the quality will be quite poor.

After this we went over to an Island, took a scenic walk and then went snorkelling (sp?). Being a Canadian, I felt the need to demonstrate that 19 degree water is not cold enough to warrant a wetsuit. Mike provided us with refreshments throughout the day. As they were freshly cut, he had to go below deck a few times. For some reason he chose to leave me in charge at one point when we were approaching rocks on the left, and another yacht was squeezing us on the right. I found it quite stressfull and fun at the same time -- as any over turning of the wheel on my part would have had us in a sticky situation on either side.   Name of the boat?  Gungha II.

Took the bus back to Auckland today at noon thirty and find myself here, in the land of cheap internet. Staying once again at the Auckland City YHA. I believe my flight leaves tomorrow, the 30th at 6:30pm. If I'm wrong about that, mom or dad, make an international call to the Auckland City YHA and leave a note at the front desk. They'll find me. I'm known in these parts ;-)

Even if that i'sn't the right time, I'll be at the airport about 2hours in advance cause I'm conservative like that.

I think I'll just relax and finish my last book tonight. Hopefully nobody snores in the dorm cause I can actually sleep in tomorrow.

So.. What's different over here? It's the little things really. The toilets drain neither clockwise nor anti-clockwise (counter-clockwise) as the way they flush seems to have a jet spraying action to them.  All the light switches are reversed. (Up == off, and Down == on)  All electrical outlets have a switch on them so that you can turn off standby features on electric accessories at the wall. This excellent idea for conservation really comes into play on years like this one where the country receives very little rain. Apparently 60% of the country's power is hydro-electric, so in times of drought (sp?) they can run into their own electric crises... There's a whole"Save 10%" campaign going on right now.

Did I mention this?  While in Dunedin, Katie and I stopped into the Info Centre (tourist bureau) to gather up some pamphlets. When we walked in the door, we were asked to be photographed for some sort of New Zealand tourist pamphlet. I was given one of the polaroid discards so I have proof. I hope someday to see this pamphlet. It really can't compare to Katie's full page spread in relation to her acting career out east.

After polling many many people on their mother land -- Canadians and UKians (that's what I call them) make up the bulk of New Zealand backpackers. So, have no fear, we're welcome and well represented over here. It must be something in our culture that encourages travelling about like this.  I've only seen 2 Americans, and we're quite easy to pick out by our accents.

Something else I've noticed -- Almost all the Canadians over here have our flag sewn onto their backpack. Strangely though, no other country does this. It's something practically unique to Canada. We're an incredibly patriotic country.

(TECH NOTE: Sorry about the lack of line/paragraph breaks. I put them in, but they don't show up on all computers for some reason...)

So now that I'm basically done here, who wants to backpack around Canada with me?
I'm going to miss the coastline, the hilly terrain, and the delightful accents among other things.   Try to get a bunch of Kiwi's to talk about eggs if you can. Katie knows what I'm talking about. Try not to laugh though as then they'll cut their conversation short ;)

Please excuse the massive size and varying quality. I won't be able to post all my 800 or so pictures in reasonable quality until I have the time back in NA... which will probably be September. Enjoy these choice cuts.

       quickly, for my own record. The following bands were supposed to play at the concert I went to:
Cooltones, Slipstream, Pine, Hit Machine, Fat Freddy's Drop, Orkid, 4 Man Bob, Betchadupa, The Chills, Eight, P/Money w/ Scribe, Cripple Mr Onion, Newmatics, Shape Shifter, Blindspott, Salmonella Dub.

The concert ended really early (1.5 hours) so a few of those bands must have dropped out. Couldn't figure out who though cause nobody was announced as they went on or off stage....

On a bus to picton tomorrow at 7am. Immediately get on a ferry when I arrive there and should be in Wellington at round 3pm. 

So, what did I not get time to do on the south island?... uh-oh no time left. bye

       Alright. Camera fixed. The owner here is quite a nice guy. Probably could've gotten a job here if I was staying long enough. So, I have another 350 pictures to take before leaving NZ. It's clearing up a bit out there, I think I'll go on a long walk along the river.

       So, in Christchurch today. All my plans for the city have fallen through due to bad weather and lack of tourists. For example, Kayaking/Rafting trips are all off today due to lack of interest. I'll just have to limit myself to shopping (I never buy anything besides books) and walking.

Techie guy here in the cafe just broke my memory stick (the memory for my digital camera) so I'll have to convince him to let me onto the administration computer. Be back in a bit.

       Once again, short on time so I can't jot down all I want to.

So... after Queenstown where did I go? Franz Joseph/f... It's a giant glacier. Got there too late to walk on the glacier though, so I ran a track which I thought would get me pretty close to it. Didn't really.... Took an amazing picture of it from far away though. Hope it turns out.

Apparently that mountain goat I saw is called a "Thar" ?

Met a guy from Israel who guessed I was an American before I even opened my mouth. Apparently I have some sort of north american style going on... It has alot to do with the fitted baseball cap apparently. If he didn't know I was a backpacker though I imagine he would've just guessed I was a scarfie. Anyways, met a girl called Peppa (seriously) and her friend Genevieve (?), also met Peter. Enjoyed some free vanilla tea with these new people. FJYHA is incredible by the way... Everything but their beds. Managed to get some sleep as the snoring wasn't nearly as loud this time around.

Left in the morning to go to Greymouth to catch the TranzAlpine train to Christchurch which is supposed to be a breathtaking journey through the alps and past historic mining sites. Well, it rained all day, coast to coast so I didn't really get to see much. Anyways, I'm here in Christchurch now debating whether to stay all day tomorrow and the night as well. It's either that or bus up to Nelson and see if there's anything to do. Either way my next stop will be Picton -- from there I take the ferry to Wellington and hopefully meet back up with Amnon's future flatmates. 

Why all the hurry? Well time's running out and I'd still like to see the Bay of Islands which is north of Auckland... So, it'll be close as to whether or not I can make it..

Go Sens Go!
and mom, you really have to stop giving this address out to everyone... do the neighbors have it too?  :)  Just kidding.

Have to go...

       Queenstown is such a tourist trap.. The prices are astronomical here. If you ever visit NZ, buy food and such before entering Queenstown. Stock up again after leaving.

Anyways, it rained through the night but started clearing up at around 7:30 am. I thought it looked like it would hold off for a while so I looked for a reasonably long hike I could take quickly while the weather held off. I ended up hiking to the summit (near anyways, more on that later) of Mt. Something something. I have pictures and the name written down somewhere, but once again, no time to get into that.

So, I did the trail as fast as possible to avoid rain. I took a ton of pictures (too many actually). After about 2 hours I finally noticed that NZ lacks wildlife in a big way. All they have over here are birds. Sheep are plentiful, but they're not exactly wild. Anyways, just after thinking this, I heard a noise to my right and noticed that I'd stumbled upon a herd of what appeared to be mountain goats. I took some pictures so someone will have to identify them for me later. Pretty exciting stuff.

The trail was marked 3 hours, for experts only.  Never having climbed a mountain before, I thought, "this is the thing for me -- I'll do it in 2 hours"

Anyways, I had plenty of gear in my backpack (and it's still there now) in case the weather turned on me and I was exposed at the top of a mountain. I had to keep resting more and more frequently.. I really pushed myself today. I kept pushing towards the summit. However, due to a variety of reasons, I decided to eat my lunch about 10 minutes from the summit and turn back. I was starting to get a bit of vertigo going on, the wind was picking up, I didn't trust the clouds, and my shoes aren't made for that sort of thing anyways. So, I turned back... I think I know my limits a bit better now, but I still don't know my breaking point.

Jogged parts of the way down, that was pretty fun. Didn't see the mountain goat things on the way down. Did hear an odd mammal off in the distance though. Didn't see any hobbits. Only 5 other people did I pass on the way down. They probably took the gondola halfway up though judging by their lack of backpacks (les touristes). I don't have money for such things unfortunately.

Took a trail called one-mile-track or some such... Then stumbled upon a fairly abandoned trail called the Water Works. Incredible stuff. Water falls, rain foresty area.  Some of the most precious times on this whole trip have been when I've gone off without a tour, by myself, on unmarked trails.  This particular path will never be part of a tour because it's simply too unsafe. I have fairly good balance and I still managed to slip a few times uncomfortably close to the stream. More pictures were taken of all this...

I really need a camera with a wideangle lense. Some of the panoramas I could have captured today would have simply amazed. 

Finished that trail. Walked around the bay and dryed off just as it started to rain... here I am.
Hopefully tomorrow I leave for Franz Joseph/f glacier which is northwest from here.

running out of internet time, and new zealand time. ciao

       Alright, it's been a long time since I posted anything significant. Don't know if I'll have time to get everything up to speed. It seems I must try though because everybody has been taking wild guesses at where I am, what I'm doing. For example, I haven't been to any glaciers yet. :-p

Alright, so -- I flew out of Wellington safely to Dunedin ages ago. Since then I stayed with some of Katie's friends. Justin, Darren, Mark and Malcolm. (+ others perhaps -- sorry, I'm rushed)  Must say those were some very cold nights. The people there know how to build houses on hills, but apparently haven't heard of insulation.

Went midnight swimming in Dunedin with people mentionned above, along with Rebecca and Emily. This was in the ocean no less. It was quite cold, and spur of the moment. Worth it however... This was immediately after watching the Matrix 2 premiere just past midnight. The movie is not worth watching in my opinion.

I walked all over Dunedin during my time there. Walked up the steepest street in the world. Caught some amazing views from the top of Mt. Mccargil (?) and Signal Hill. Walked dogs (from a kennel)... Saw glowworms (for free!)... sat around a lot. Read books. (Finished Dune, as well as How To Be A Canadian, or something like that)

... Left Dunedin on a Tour Bus called "Bottom Bus" or "Scarfie"... run by "Kiwi Experience". Went through the Catlins which are beautiful. This is all on the southeast coast of the South Island. Stayed in uhm.. Riverton, just past Invercargill. Riverton is a little small town, nothing really to see there. We stopped at various places. One of which, the name escapes me at the moment -- we had the pleasure to see a Sea Lion up close and personal. Walked along some beaches, stopped for many photos (will post them if I have time in Ottawa)

Stayed in Te Anau last night. INCREDIBLE place. Only about 1750 pop. but their national park is beautiful. No time to recall the name right now though. We pulled in late at 2:30, I really wanted to go tramping though so I walked briskly towards the biggest mountain in the distance. Managed to get to the end of Dove Bay and took some stunning photos. But this was around 4:30 so I had promised myself I'd turn around by then as it'd be getting dark soon. So I turned around and started walking back to the hostel as the sun went down. Started getting back as it became pitch black out. Quite the experience walking down an unlit path in the dark without a torch (that's what they call flashlights over here)

The hostel was pretty nice. I stayed in a dorm with a Canadian from Winnipeg, somebody from Sweden and a hitchhiker from France. On the bus I'd been hanging out with a Turkish man who lives in Switzerland. SeerChulk or something like that. Oh, names of other people... hm... Rachael, Marie.. Jesse is a guy that was on the bottom bus, another canuck, being from Brandford, going to York next year so he's getting all the travelling out of his system right now.

Don't know anybody here in Queenstown YHA yet. Might not have any time. Kind of tired from today. In a dorm room with 7 other people, all assumedly guys tonight. I'm running out of time on internet, and in New Zealand. Kind of sad. Don't know yet how I'll be spending the rest of my time here. I'll be spending tonight, and tomorrow night here in Queenstown. I guess I'll just go walking tomorrow.

Today we left Te Anau and went to Milford Sound. Incredible. Today was the first day I experienced New Zealand rain, no problem though as you could go wait inside the tour boat. Cause of the fog/rain some of the beautiful sights were missed. This was made up for in that, the rain creates many more waterfalls to view.

Anyways... Nice to hear that many people are reading this thing now. I really had just intended it to be for myself, but we all know how word travels in our family :)

I must go now as I belive I've spent way too much at this internet terminal now. (Please excuse grammar, spelling and sentance structure, this keyboard is broken, and I'm quite rushed)

       Yay Otago. Made it here to Dunedin fine, Katie met me at the Airport.
I should go right now though cause there are other people waiting to use this computer. (on campus)

       Didn't take note of when I logged into this computer so I'll make this entry fast.

Just booked a flight to Dunedin from wellington via the internet. Can't print stuff out here though so I pray the computers over at the airport work fine tomorow. I have no idea where the airport is actually, so I guess I'll just pay some huge amount for a cab... paid for that ticket by mastercard. $158NZ (no insurance)

Kinda worried that my bag will be too heavy and they'll kick me off the flight. Max is 20kgs... and I have more than 20kgs for sure... So hopefully it works out. If not... I guess I'm stuck here and will be out $158 dollars.

The flat is having a big dinner tonight. I get a free ride on that. They're too friendly to let me say no.

Well, if it all works out okay, I'll get to see Katie tomorrow which is awesome cause that's why I'm over here in the first place :)

       I get kind of nervous logging on to internet, my email, and my blog in these internet cafes. I know how easy it is to cache/sniff all the internet traffic and steal passwords. It's also trivial to install a keylogger and grab all the passwords that way. Only a computer nerd such as myself thinks about these things. Oh well. I guess I'll change all my passwords once I'm done with internet cafes.

Happy birthday dad. Happy early anniversary and mother's day if I'm off by a day or two when I remember closer to the actual date.

Turangi was horrible. Don't know why the tour stopped there. Anyways, today was just a lot of travelling with stops on the way here to Wellington. I think I got to see Mordor from the Lord of The Rings. I'll have to watch the movie again and see what I recognize. Across the road from here they have a giant Golem head and arms sticking out of a 4 storey building. They're quite proud that Lord of the Rings was filmed over here.

Shared a bunk with a German the other day. He'd finished his mandatory time in military service about a half year ago so he went off travelling immediately after. He's almost out of money though so he's flying back to Germany soon enough. Hm... James from England was cool. He's been travelling for over a year. Anna from southern England hooked me up with a list of obscure bands I should check out. Met an Auzzie (sp?) couple, an england couple, and a couple from Finland. They informed me that Canada is playing Finland in some ice hockey finals. They found out via textmessaging on a cellphone.  There's really no news about Ice Hockey over here. Everybody follows Rugby... Makes me wish I'd taken up the Ottawa boys offer for me to try out for Ottawa Scottish. 

Met a guy from France. He was the quietest of the bunch from last night's hostel.  Patrick and Ray from Ireland were pretty cool> i thought ray in particular was after my lucky charms>

ahahaha  i"d ask for help> but i"m not asianish>

so i"ve already met the people from amnon"s flat>>>  everyone but the girl that amnon knows actually which is kind of strange cause i have no connection whatsoever to the people who let me into their apartment and into their flatmate"s bedroom>  they"re incredibly nice people for doing that>  and the way things are right now    it"s a really nice place> it has the style of the appartment on big brother> two of the people who live there are artistic it seems so they have some nice decor> i"ll be heading back there for half an hour> i"ve been invited out with them tonight>  so  tomorrow i"ll check out the museum here and maybe find something else to do around here>>> maybe a boat tour or seomthing>  i haven"t done that in nz yet>

katie has a fairly relaxed homework schedule next week  i wanted to ferry from wellington to the south isle> so maybe i"ll just do it in reverse> i imagine i"ll have enough time>

i"m just warning everyone> the people i"m around all the time have all these incredible plans  they"re filling my head with the notion that travelling for a good long time is a great idea>

i"ve fallen behind on my plan to become a lean machine> i haven"t done much trekking around on food> unless you consider walking twenty minutes from the wellington city yha down the street to the flat i"ll be staying in with my pack to be strenuous>  i"m also eating a lot more now than when i first came over>  my craving for large amounts of protein kicked in>

wow >> three dollars an hour>   
so >> how are they doing? guess they"re in the third round (semis) now?

(fixed the keyboard thingy)
I can't wait till I get a few days to just sit down and do nothing... It feels like that'd be a waste of time and money though. So I guess I'll keep wandering around, trying to keep my eyes and my camera busy.

Wellington is dang windy..

And I think UWO means something over here. Cause I swear some people have laughed at my hat. Either that or a) baseball hats aren't cool over here  or b) my face is funny in and of itself.... Hopefully Kiwi's are just really funny people who like to have monologues in their head, and THAT's why they're laughing all the time.

Michael got "accused" of being Canadian the other day. He certainly doesn't sound Canadian to me, but he definately has lost his Irish accent from all that travelling he's done.  I'm not losing my Canadian/American accent that's for sure. Most people have no trouble understanding it as long as I speak very loudly. :)

Don't have much time left... Time to walk to the flat.
I don't think I have to worry about Muggers, cause really, I think I probably look like the type that does all the mugging. Hands in pockets, black jacket, hat, "bus face"... ya know.

       So little time and so much to update on. Well, I guess it would be... Two nights ago? I did some stuff in the day... Met up with a guy from Holland. We went to the Globe bar in Auckland. Had a good time. Met some more travellers. A journalist from Holland, a guy from Switzerland... hm..

The next day I got on the Magic bus ($189NZ) to start heading south. Went through Waitomo and slept in Rotorua. Met a guy from Japan, somebody from France, plenty of people from England. Spending most of my time on this bus ride with a guy called Michael from Northern Ireland. Spent the night last night in Rotorua at a hostel called The Wall. (Because it has an indoor rock climbing wall... much better than that place we go to in Ottawa all the time)  Met a guy from Australia, some girl from Wales... Seems like everybody has read Stupid White Men by Michael Moore. He always comes up in conversation when Bush gets talked about...

Spotted a few more Canadians. We're almost obnoxious in how prominently we display our Flag. :)  Discussed it with some people and seems that people think we show our flag all over the place so people know we're "not american".. 

When I get home, I really want to travel around Canada by the same methods.

Saw a geiser, some hot pools, steamvents and such. Plenty of sheep and beautiful hills and all that. My camera battery died so I'm on to AA Batteries now. Hopefully Katie has a CD burner so I can get all these pictures off the camera before something happens to it in customs on the way back or something.

So, I'm in Taupo right now if I hadn't mentionned that already. It's on the east edge of Lake Taupo I guess. Apparently the largest lake in the Southern hemisphere...

Did I mention the plane I was on from LAX to Auckland had Frodo written all over it? Air New Zealand seems proud of the whole Lord of the Rings thing.

Anyways, hopefully I find something to do for the next bit in Taupo. Will be sleeping in  Turangi or something tonight before heading on to Wellington tomorrow morning. Might get a free place to sleep tomorrow through Amnon's connections over here. Would be nice. If not, no biggie. Hostels are fun. :)

gotta go. 3 minutes left.

So, I have no tshirts left. I might be leaving tomorrow morning at 8:30 to hit up Waitomo, Rotorua and Taupo on the way to Wellington. So I'll try to do laundry tonight.

So I'm off of coffee it looks like. Just not something you want to be drinking if you spend all your time walking. I actually get tired these days too. I could sleep right now if I wanted to but I have to eat and do my laundry first. Exciting eh?

I keep noticing all these neat things throughout the day, but my shortterm being what it is, I forget it all before I get online to write the stuff down. For example, after I finished the Antarctic Penguin adventure today (as I like to call it) I walked over to one of the hills/parks I'd seen from Skytower. I forget the name of the thing already.. incredible isn't it?

Really, someone with my lack of ability with names should not be touring by themselves. I've always said that I navigate by landmarks. Do you have any idea how tough that is to pull off when you're in completely new land? maybe...

Anyways. Sort of met some people from Ireland that once had jobs in Ottawa. One of the people worked for Corel (laid off), and the other is taking Computer Science somewhere, how cute. Bumped into some Calgarians while looking at penguins.

Possum Bourne died recently. He was NewZealand's only rally car driver. People here seemed to have loved him very much. NZ lost America's Cup in a big way this year. It shows as America's Cup souveniers are dirt cheap.

Speaking of souveniers, I've seen some good ones, but there's no room in my pack unfortunately. So i'll be picking them upon my return to Auckland at the end of the month. Hope people like Auckland.

Upon my first trip to a dairy I wanted some bread that looked like it could substitute for a meal. I bought some Vogel's... turns out it's quite popular over here. If New Zealand had a national bread, I think vogel's would be it.

Chemist == Drug Store

My face is a bit burnt from lying down on the top of a hill for way too long. My feet hurt a bit, but it's bearable. My calfs burn like mad, and I'm sure they'll hurt even more once I pick up and move to a new town. If I keep walking everwhere like I have been, I should be a lean machine by the time camp starts.

angry that i won't be able to charge my camera here... It *does* take AA batteries though. So i guess I'll just burn through packs of those. I better slow down with the picture taking too, i've already taken 80ish.

anyone feel like cracking my back?
Hopefully the money change is open past 6pm... will go check once my internet time runs out.

       My first post, hopefully is works. Once again, this blog is mostly for my own benefit. Close friends may find it interesting in very small doses. I realy don't have time to get creative with the posts though because internet time is fairly expensive.

This hour costs $2.00 NZ.. Hit the SkyTower today, walked to a park I saw from the skydeck... Then I walked to Mt. Eden and checkout out some millenia old volcano craters. In retrospect I probably should have taken the bus to Mt Eden as my shoes are trash. I got to scope out all the prime real estate on the way though which is a plus... This is a good thing, cause, after a few hours in Auckland -- I'm thinking I should move here.

Don't worry mom, I'm just kidding. I'm sure the thrill will wear off. Still no plan for when to leave Auckland... When I get bored Iguess. Then to Dunedin at some point, and to Wellington most likely as Imight be able to lodge there for free for a bit.  

It's boiling out there but all the locals are wearing pants. What's the deal?  I'm out there in my shorts of course and I'm still finding it hot. 

So Ihaven't met my bunkmates yet, should be interesting. I'm in the Auckland City YHA tonight in room 303 sharing it with 3 others.

Cost?  $22.00 + $35.00 YHA membership.

What else did I buy today?.... $11.00 bus ride and a $20.00 local phone card.
$??.?? on the SkyTower dealie.

I'll be trying to keep track of my money in front of ya'll.. Still can't figure out the international calls, sorry about that peeps.

Oh yeah, I can't get used to people driving on the other side of the road here. Takes me way too long to figure out when it's safe to cross the road. I check a good eight times before crossing... There's that, and they have 6 way pedestrian crossings here. It blew my mind the first time I saw it.

Looks like rain out there. Better jet back to the hostel and... I dunno. Change into some pants or something.

Cheers!
