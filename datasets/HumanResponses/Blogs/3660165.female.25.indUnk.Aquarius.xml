      hi! i have now successfully remembered my password! now for a story: Jenny was always a nice girl.  But even nice girls can mix in with the bad crowd.  One day, while walking home from school, Jenny met a band of rabid squirlls.  "Come with us" they said.  So she did, and that was her first mistake.  The next day Jenny skipped school and hung out at WalMart all day, harassing the grannys. that was her second mistake.  The next day Jenny was found dead with blood all over her.  The doctery poeple did some tests and found out that it ws Jaguar blood.  The jaguar lived in a tree and loved squirlls.  when the doctery people came to hir door it said: "You're not in hot water, your in a steaming bucket of...Barf!" and then all the doctory poeple fell down dead THE END  i'd sleep lightly toninght. you never know when there's a murderer about.  and you never know who whould want to kill you it could be someone in your cabin.
