        Man, my leg really hurts. I'm limping around my house. It really sucks. The penicillin shot in my thigh is making my leg really sore, almost like it's cramping all the time. Another thing that sucks pretty bad is that I've decided to go to school tomorrow. I figured I've missed enough days as is and I don't need to miss any more. But, I really don't want to do the homework that I should have done a while ago. Oh well, I gotta do what I gotta do.

        Well, three hours at the doctor's office and I have strep. The doc gave me two options for treatment: a really big shot of penicillin or a ten day regime of two pills a day. I chose the shot. And now my leg is really sore from where she stabbed me. It sucked. Oh well, at least I don't have West Nile Virus, or anything scary like that. 
 BTW, I didn't go to school today.  Also, I saw Mars last night.  It was kinda cool.

        All that B.S. about me going to go do my homework, and I didn't do any of it. I'll copy the Government off of someone and prolly get Travis's Calculus. I did do something today. I put a whole bunch of pictures up on my wall. It really looks good, if I may say so myself. Unfortunately, there are several people who I don't have any pictures of ... hmm ... I wonder who one of them is ... 
 Enewayz, I'm finta go to bed b/c I'm starting to get a headache and hopefully sleep will keep it away. Plus, I'm tired. Plus, there's school tomorrow. Plus, I'm just gonna. 
 Aite, I'm going to bed now.  5-6-7-8 and Sleep!

        Well, I am have decided to retire for the night. I have not completed the summer reading assignment. I need sleep though. I know I could stay up and keep working but I've been falling asleep in this chair. I'm gonna get up early tomorrow and write my last essay but the journal will be a day late. I feel defeated. Oh well, that's how it rolls.

        Okay, I'm back on the blog.  I got in from Dad's house earlier this afternoon.  It actually wasn't so bad over there this weekend.  He just tripped our over a few things, but that's to be expected. 
 Yeee-haw!!!  The Titans won today.  I watched it; it was such a close game in the beginning, I was scared we might actually lose this one.  But, boy, once we got that safety, the whole team turned around and the momentum shifted into out direction and never changed back.  We whooped their asses.  Yippee!!! 
 Aite, I'm still working on getting my "old" blog back up here, so bear with me for the moment.  In case you didn't know, I took it all down because Dana and Michelle and their momma were finta kill me.  They seemed to think that this was all disrespectful to Dana.  While I don't agree, I took it down because I didn't want to have to deal with that kind of shit.  At Michelle's suggestion, I wrote Dana a note explaining what I'd done and why I'd done it and appologizing.  It was three pages long.  I gave it to her in second period when she was giving Fernando a picture of herself.  As I handed it to her, Fernando screams out "Oh, a note.  What say it?"  I wanted to kill him.  He is so annoying, he get's on my everlasting nerves.  Geez.  Dana also gave me a picture, without anything on the back, and I was like "well, you know your gonna have to figure out something special to write."  She just said "okay."  (She wrote on the back Friday morning.)  But Fernando thought he was so special because she'd written on his "To: My best friend, Fernando.  From: Your best (U.S.A.) friend, Dana"  He thinks he's all that and a bag of chips, but he's really just falling into her trap.  Muh hah hah hah.  I warned him, but it was up to him to listen.  ROFLMAO!!!  That really sucks for him, but he's really getting on my nerves lately.  He's been copying what I do a lot lately.  He knew about me and Dana and became "best friends" with her.  After I "bad-mouthed" her on my blog, he did the same on his, just twenty times worse.  When I took mine offline because it was "offensive" he did the same, replacing his with a message that was exactly what I'd told him I was feeling.  He's just doing everything I do, and trying to outdo me with them.  It's getting on my fucking nerves, I wish he'd stop. 
 Okay, I'm going to do some more work towards putting the rest of my blog up. 
 BTW:  A cat is sitting in my lap purring very loudly.  I really like cats; I think I'm a cat person.

       Okay, I'm no longer going to use this blog.  I'm going to have a different one that will not be public.  Sorry if I offended you with the old one. 
 Also,  do not copy what I say .  Whatever I say, or do, is what i said or did.  It is not for other people to steal.  Don't do it.  That is bullshit and you shouldn't do it.  If you want to say something, say it, don't take it from my mouth.

        Today was a really good day. I had a lot of fun and didn't have to deal with any bullshit. I didn't have to do anything in my first three  classes. 
 English was fun because  The Importance of Being Ernest  is a  really   funny play and I'm reading the part of a character who talks a lot. I think it is hilarious how every, single character is a complete and utter moron; they remind me of many people I know. LOL 
 Government was cool because Robin, Whitney, Lauren, and I left to talk with Mrs. Stewart and Mrs. Shaw about different things. We got Mrs. Stewart to  use Class money to buy a flower arrangement for Ms. Conn. We talked to Mrs. Shaw about class officer stuff and then Mrs. Norris about the future student council. I'm still pissed that class officers are ineligible to run. Although we were out of class for the entire period, the bad thing was that we got stuck in Mrs. Norris' office because of her mouth. Her voice is so smooth and soothing that it could put even an insomniac to sleep. Robin, Lauren, and I left Whitney behind because Mrs. Norris wanted to talk to her. After about fifteen minutes we realized that Whitney probably needed a "rescue." I told the sub "we just realized that we left our fourth member behind and she's with someone who talks a whole lot. Can I go rescue her?" The sub said yes. Ha, ha, ha! I went down to guidance and told Whitney and Mrs. Norris that the sub needed Whitney to come to class and finish her assignment. Once we got away, I told Whitney the truth and she thanked me. Ha! Ha! 
 Some funny quotes from Calculus:  Richard thought Zach said he didn't understand the Calculus. Richard screamed out, "Ha, I feel smart. Take that, bitch." I started laughing but Zach, looking flustered, went off on Richard about "Are you in the top 10? No, there are only 5 in it." Zach was really going off but he didn't make sense for a while until he said that he meant 10%. 
 After Mr. Aihie had to correct my test grade (BECAUSE TRAVIS BLAZED ME) from a 90% to an 85% (I missed three problems worth five points a piece), Alex said "He's a college calculus teacher but he can't count." Mr. Aihie didn't find it amusing. 
 Also in Calculus, Mr. Aihie tried to tell us that if the problem is worded "where x is at 1" means "as x approaches 1" which is completely different. "X is at 1" means x = 1. "As x approaches 1" means that x includes numbers that lead up to, but do not include, x. It is a huge difference, trust me, ask any Calculus student or math teacher. He told us that "a sentence in Calculus is not a sentence. Math is just understanding a different language." That's why I hate Calculus, it's math and Mr. Aihie doesn't admit when he's wrong, even if it's obvious.

        I love knowing that I have helped someone. Yes, Fernando, now you know the truth. Doesn't it feel great? No? I didn't think so, but at least you know it. I can tell you, though, it's hard as hell to stick to and continue to believe. You believe it, but you don't accept it. It's when you accept it and live by it when you are successful. Only then will women see that you aren't playing and that you mean what you say.

        You know what I've realized? I've realized that anyone in the world can read my blog and take it for whatever they want. But, the one thing that people may not realize is that I may not be telling the truth. So, before you get all huffy-puffy and get your panties all in a wad, just think, "Is George telling the truth?" 
 I'll tell you this much though, if it's the truth, I usually tell the truth but you must  always  take anything you hear with a grain of salt. That's my piece of wisdom for today. You should take that wisdom with a grain of salt, too. LOL I crack my self up...

  And I hate it when people flat out lie for no got-damned reason. Don't y'all? Also, if you're gonna lie, why not make it at least  half-way  believable?  Geez.  I  hate  people like that. That's what's got me so fucked up. I hate and love at the same fucking time. Geez. Why don't you just fucking leave me the fuck alone?

        You wanna know something I think is funny? A whole bunch of colleges I haven't expressed interest in are sending me applications and telling me my fee is waived. I've received waivers from Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois; Tulane University in Akron, Ohio; and Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. I've also received information from literally hundreds of colleges and universities that I've never heard of before and don't want to go to. 
 Enewayz, that was random. I gotta lotta homework to do. I have four essays for English, a paper to type for Ms. "A.," the questionaire for Mrs. Shaw, an outline of my  entire  senior thesis for Sr. Thesis, and I think that's it.  Okay, I'm gonna go work on that now.

        Aite, here are my final thoughts on the matter: 
 Yes, I can honestly say I enjoyed it while it lasted. It hurts like hell right now, but I need to come to terms with myself and my situation. I've come to realize several things because of Dana: 
   Girls play too many games. 
 Girls don't realize that other people are onto their games. 
 Dana has a mean temper. 
 Dana is a really big flirt who craves attention from as many guys as possible. 
 Dana doesn't really care too much for the feelings of those guys. 
 Dana just wants that attention, but when it gets too close/much she wants it to stop, so she stops feeding it. 
 I still really like Dana. 
 In order to "cease and desist" I need to remove myself from negative surroundings. 
 I've really got to try to not interact with Dana. 
 I can just see it now:  If I'm still approachable by Dana then I know I will let her approach me and get back inside my head. 
 I've got to stop letting girls get in my head. I do that, and it ends up not working out at all and, usually, blowing up in my face.   
 Maybe, I should just stop fucking trying. I mean, girls just play too many games and get inside guys heads. I hope that any and all girls that read this page understand how painful games are. I really wish girls understood. Please, if you are a girl and are reading this, take it to heart and think about it next time you start playing a game with a guy. Guys would much rather just be told straight up that a girl doesn't like him than to be batted around. Trust me, you can ask any guy and I'm pretty sure they'd agree.

        Congratulations Richard!!! He got into the University of Memphis and will probably get a full in-state scholarship. That's really good news for him. 
 I itch like a motha f'er. At the cross country meet yesterday the place I had to stand to make sure people went around the cone had about a kajillion mosquitos. They tore my @ss up. It was really bad. I have so many mosquito bites all over my face, head, neck, arms, chest, legs, basically everywhere. It is awful. It itchs so much it hurts. Aaaaaaahhhhh!!! 
 Yesterday was my birthday and it started out pretty good. But, the mosquitos and something that happened when someone said "ur not hte only person in this world george" kinda bummed me out. That comment is making me think of the futility of something I'm doing. And now a deep, philosophical question: Why is it that when someone knows you like them they treat you like shit but when they aren't sure that you are totally committed they treat you so well? I don't know the answer, only that person knows it. Camille told me she used to play those kinda games and the only way she stopped was when she realized that she was messin' with people's minds and forced herself to stop. She said nothing can help someone come to those conclusions. Shit for me. 
 Ah well, life can be a bitch and there's nothing I can do about it. The key to change, in my situation, lies squarely on someone else's shoulders.

        Okie dokie, I'm back on Comcast. I have to wait for BellSouth to activate the DSL before it will work. The BellSouth lady said it would probably be before 7:00 p.m. but they had until 11:59 a.m. to activate it. Ugh, they are really taking "Activated on Wednesday" to the limit, literally. 
 In other news, some fool called my house and asked if "Peaches" was there. 
I said, "No, you have the wrong number." 
"What?  Lemme talk to Peaches." 
"This isn't Peaches' number.  It's the wrong number." 
"Well you don't have to get smart with me.  It's not my fault." 
"How is it not your fault? You had the wrong number." 
 OMG!!! She just called back because I got smart with her the first time. She got a hold of Peaches and told her my number and Peaches is gonna call me to talk bad to me for getting smart with Jasmine. What the fucking hell?!?!?!?! OMG, Peaches just called me. I just hung up on her. 
 Jasmine just called back. I asked her why in the hell she kept calling me. Now she is putting me on three-way with Peaches. ROFLMAO!!! This is so funny. She doesn't know how to do three-way. HAHAHAHAHH!!! I had to tell her how. This is so funny. OMG!!! This is so crazy. Can y'all believe this? I am so serious; I am not making this up. Peaches is going jewelry shopping. Jasmine goes to Litton Middle School and is in the fifth grade. This is so funny. 
 Man, this is so crazy. I finally hung up on her, again. I really don't know why I was talking to her in the first place. Damn, that was really strange.

        Okay, sorry for not updating yesterday.  I just didn't get around to it. 
 I think I flubbed the interview today (for Oasis Youth Council). I messed up my answers for a few questions, but I don't know. The lady in charge of the OYC knew me from a previous volunteer job there and she seemed to be feelin' my answers. But, of course, Robin kept one-upping my answers and then says, "well, I don't think I can really do it because I'm gonna be doing Mayor's Youth Council." Argh, she gets on my nerves. But, the funniest thing about it was that afterwards, my dad was supposed to pick me up but he went to the NCCJ offices to get me. He was mad and cussin' at me and everything. I was scured. 
 Random Rant:  Why the hell did George  W.  Bush have to come to Nashville in the middle of rush hour? Traffic was an effe'ing nightmare about 3:20 and the interstate (24/40E) was completely stopped. The bridges downtown were backed up across the river. The list of nightmares goes on. Ugh, and all he was here for was to make some damned money for the Republican party. Why is he the only President that actually goes out and does so many dinner/fund-raisers? The two times he's been to Nashville as President he's stopped by an East Nashville school and made some blood-money for the Republican party. Can't he do that from Washington? Can y'all tell I don't like  W ? 
 Aite, I'm gonna try to find out how I'm gonna do my poetry response for English when I don't have poems and then I'm going to go to bed. Plus, I'm gonna talk to the future mother of my child(ren). Y'all know who that is...

        WOW!!! I just got home from spending a whole 13 hours at school. That's right, THIRTEEN!! I volunteered to help cover for Mr. Aihie at Open House. I was in his room from 1:45 p.m. until basically 8:30 p.m. That's a long @ss time to be in there. Brad also helped me. He was "Mr. I;" I was "Mr. Hear." HAHAHAHAHAH! Get it? lol 
 In other news, after leaving a message that talked bad to someone in a nice way, I got talked bad to today in a rather nice way. Although, she knew I was not talking about what she was talking about. She knows what I mean, plus she's still doing exactly what I said she prolly would. Enewayz, I need to call Millie and write a poetry response for English. Good news: I finished all the Calculus I needed to do because I Mr. Aihie helped Brad and I until 4:00 p.m. and then we worked on it for the rest of the time. 
 FWIW: Coach Fey went off on me today. It was rather funny. I was walking into the gym to go to the weight room and he yelled, "What do you want?" I said, "I'm not talkin' to you" and kept walking. "I didn't ask if you were talking to me, what are you doing? ... Don't walk into my gym with that attitude. ... I don't want to see you come through here ever again. ... etc."  thought it was kinda funny though, cause he was really working it into a big deal when it really wasn't.

And Richard, I don't care if the Asian looks good. I really don't. I care about how good my bed feels and who is in it. (Me and maybe someone else, but it's gotta be that special one...)

        ROFLMAO:  What about I was comin' home from a VanderVotes organizational meeting with Marissa and her roommate and this yellow sporty car pulled up beside us with music blaring.  The funny thing was the guy looked like he was about 75 years old!!!  Well, Marissa's roommate started "dancin'" to it and the 75 year old guy looked over and laughed!  Then when the light turned green he squeeled tires tryin' to pull out but it was a red light a block away.  That's when Marissa's roommate noticed that the guy was from the same county of Georgia as she was.  They were shoutin' back and forth to each other about where they lived and all that.  That's when we realized that he wasn't really 75 but only about 30 years old!  It was soooo funny though, y'all just had to have been there.  Plus the three of us together were all just crackin' up.  OMG y'all it was great!  But, the point of me bein' at the meeting was because Marissa thinks the NCCJ YAC's Nashville Project should work on leading a voter registration drive among high schoolers.  Marissa also thinks the Oasis Center would be a great partner for voter registration.  Isn't that a great idea???  LOL   If you can, go out and vote!  We don't need to have a second term for Dubya, so vote his sorry ass out...     GREAT NEWS:   I get to wear my fireman suit to school tomorrow!!!  Well, I've gotta go do homework, I've gotta read about ten chapters of Mary Shelley's  Frankenstein  and answer questions on Chapters 3-17!  Plus, Shonta' can't figure out how to send an email so I can't get any help from her with these questions!  Grrrr, oh well, I guess that means I actually have to do my own work.  Yucky!  Oh yeah, Jessica is really hot but I think she and that Troy boy are gettin' closer because I've seen them together a lot more.  Grrrr, but I think I might call and say something smooth and be like "when you and Troy break up, gimme a call..."  Y'all know.  But of course I have to get the nerve to do that and all that stuff.  In other words, it prolly won't happen for a long time (read: never).  George out.

        Well, well, I got in a little while ago from the NCCJ's Minitown Counselor training session.  I rode with Jasmine in Tassany's car.  We got to the office complex a few hours early so we played in the Centennial Park playground.  It was pretty fun to play on the swings and stuff.  Man, sometimes I really wish I could be a carefree kid who can just play in the park and play...  But, alas, I am not a carefree child, I am a busy teenager with lots of committments and such.  Here's a peek at my schedule for this week after school:  (Tonight was NCCJ meeting), Tomorrow is a Rally for Runaway planning meeting at the Oasis Center, Wednesday is either an OYC training session for the Safe Place Sabbath or is an NCCJ organizational meeting to get Nashville high school seniors to register to vote, Thursday is an NCCJ YAC meeting and Marissa is having a "get-together" at her place afterwards.  And that's in addition to all my other homework and committments.  BTW: I have the rough draft of my senior thesis due on Thursday, uh yeah,  Thursday !  Which reminds me, Ms. Anthony dropped a bombshell on the Senior Thesis class today.  She informed us that beginning with the next six weeks, i.e. next Monday, she will be teaching Government.  Yes, Ms. Anthony will be teaching Government.  As in, I will have to listen to Ms. Anthony talk for two periods every day.  No more fifth period lunch hour, sleep hour, social hour, study hall, Calculus hour, etc.  We're going to have to listen to Ms. Anthony.  *sounds of head hitting desk and soft sobbing*  Also, I think I've decided that Jessica will not be callin' me and I've also decided that I'm not going to try to pursue her because her boyfriend (Troy) is a crazy-ass son-of-a-bitch that I don't want to fuck with.  He's someone who is liable to pull out a gun and shoot yo ass because you look at him funny.  Ain't no way I'm gonna cross him about "his woman."  Hell naw, I ain't touchin' that one.  I'd love for her to call me and I'd really like to have the freedom to call her but I'm not gonna fuck with him; if she wants to talk to me she's going to have to throw out the line.  But I don't think she does want to talk to me because anytime she passes my way in the hall she keeps her head straight forward and doesn't direct her eyes towards me at all.  Of course, I don't help the matter because I still haven't said anything to her, but I don't think complete and total lack of eye contact is a very friendly sign either.  Oh well, I've got a lot of homework to do; I'm going to bed.  George out.

        Today was a pretty good day, considering that it was my first day back at school since last Wednesday. 
 Ms. Anthony's class was painful, like always.  Web Page Design was pretty good, I got a new computer in there.  It's a 1 GHz G4 eMac.  LOL, you know your computer is slow when a cheap Mac is has a faster CPU.  (I've got a 700 MHz Celeron chip.)  Enewayz, we still have to use Photoshop 6 in Classic mode for our work, rather than the much-improved Photoshop 7 on OS X.  LOL, that prolly went over most of y'all's headz.  DeSha's class was aite; nothing stands out.  English was okay, we started reading Frankenstein in there.  Ms. Conn wasn't at school today for some reason and Amber, Michelle, and I went to Ms. Filson-Staggs' room and did other work in there.  Calculus was actually bearable.  Shont&aacute and Terrance helped me and I, with the help of Robin after school, finished my work by 3:15 p.m. 
 One thing that happened while I was out that is kinda funny is that many of my teachers were also absent.  It seems like whenever I'm out all the teachers miss school, too.  I swear I'm not out partying with them or anything...LMAO! 
 Jerry is kinda pissin' me off now because he didn't get Jessica's number for me today because he said someone in band sucked right in front of that kid's mother.  I don't really understand why that prevented him from getting the number, but, okay.  I want him to get the number, Richard, because I'm chicken shit and scared to death to talk to her when I see her.  I plan on saying stuff to her but whenever I actually have the opportunity I always get scared and end up not saying anything.  Jerry has said he will get the number for me because I'm so scared.

        Well, I got back from D.C. earlier today.  Simply put, it was great.  I had so much fun and have fallen in love with the city.  I know that sounds really dorky, but it's true.  I also completely changed my mind about GWU and probably saved me four years of discomfort. 
 I woke up Thursday morning about 4:00 a.m.  That was really early.  We were at the airport by 5:45 a.m.  I didn't take my shoes off when I went through security and set off the metal detectors.  Ooops.  Oh well, after I took off my shoes and was wanded Dad and I were in the terminal and walking to our flight.  Our flight was Southwest 1603 to Baltimore-Washington International Airport.  We were on the plane by 6:50 a.m.  We were sitting on the plane, buckled in and ready to go, when all the lights went out and the engines shut off.  Wow, that was kinda startling.  The flight attendent said that it was an auxillary power system that shut down because an engine sensor was malfunctioning.  About forty-five minutes later we left the airport.  Pretty smooth flight, all that crap.  (I'll skip the most boring/not interesting parts of my trip.) 
 We drove into D.C. from BWI (in the Baltimore area).  We got to the American University campus about 12:30 p.m. and met up with Robert.  He walked us around the campus a little and we met some of his friends.  He also got us some free AU t-shirts (it was homecoming week).  At 1:00 p.m. we were at the Admissions Office for a campus tour and information session.  That was over about 3:00 p.m.  We met up with Robert again and he rode with us out to Ginna and Sam's house in Fairfax, Virginia.  (Ginna is my dad's godmother's daughter.  Sam is her husband.  They're pretty cool.)  It was about an hour drive to go the &lt;30 miles to their house.  Their house was amazing.  It is a four-story townhouse in a rich part of a rich city.  The inside was even more impressive, it was really, really, really nice. 
 The next morning (Friday) Dad and I drove to the Metro (D.C.-area subway) Vienna/Fairfax-GMU stop.  We got our farecards and rode the Metro about 15 miles to the Foggy Bottom-GWU stop at The George Washington University.  The ride was about 25 minutes during rush hour (FWIW: it prolly woulda taken at least an hour driving, plus time to find a parking spot).  Also, just so y'all know, GWU was my first choice, before the trip.  The GWU campus is non-existant.  The school is simply a collection of buildings in the Foggy Bottom business district.  It was kinda a mix of East Nashville and Downtown.  I really didn't like it.  After the tour and information session we ate lunch at Kinkaid's at 2000 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Then we walked back to the Metro stop and went back to Ginna and Sam's house.  We got back about 2:30 p.m.  We chilled and talked with Ginna until Sam got home about 5:30 p.m. when we left for dinner at a Thai restaurant in Fairfax.  I got the Pineapple Fried Rice.  It was delicious.  It was even served in a pineapple half!  Enewayz, I'm a dork. 
 The next morning (Saturday) we had to leave Ginna and Sam's early because they had a wedding to go to.  We were gone by 7:30 a.m.  We drove to AU and picked up Robert and then drove to Crofton, Maryland, to see our cousin Alfred.  He's a 46 year old artist who passes for late-twenties with many of the people who know him.  He's pretty cool.  We stayed there for a little bit while we planned our day.  We left about 11:30 a.m. for the city.  The four of us plus his dog, Tristen, were going to visit the National Mall and see some of the monuments down there.  We walked around the Mall and saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and F.D.R. Memorial.  Our lovely President Bush needs to go the F.D.R. Memorial and read some of Roosevelt's quotes.  I don't remember them exactly, but I'm sure you can look them up online.  The best one was that a nation's worth isn't measured by how much wealthier the wealthy get but by how much better off the poor get, or something like that.  We also saw the not-yet-completed World War II Memorial.  It's gonna be a really nice monument.  Oh yeah, on the way from the Washington Memorial to the Lincoln we walked down the middle of the reflecting pool.   LOL (It was closed because of the construction at the WWII Memorial.) 
 That night we went to the AU homecoming culmination ceremony because Robert got us free tickets.  Dad, Alfred, Robert, and I got to walk in with the homecoming court because he worked something out.  He's got so many connections on campus it ain't even funny; plus, he's just a freshman!  Enewayz, after we watched the Court dance to Baby Boy by Beyonce (hilarious) the King and Queen were announced.  One of Robert's friends, George, was named King.  I think it's because he has such a good name.  LOL, enewayz, after that crap Margaret Cho performed.  She's hilarious, although I can honestly say now that I have gotten tired of hearing a woman say "pussy."  She kinda wore it out.  But, other than that, she was hilarious.  We actually didn't stay for the entire thing because Robert and his friends wanted to leave after about 45 minutes of it.  That was good because this girl behind us was really getting on my nerves because she was laughing  so damned loud !!!  It was fucking annoying.  Oh well. 
 This morning I slept until about 11:30 a.m., which was the latest I'd slept the entire trip.  It felt good.  About 12:30 p.m. Dad and I left Alfred's and went to his mother Helen's house for lunch.  She's a crazy, acknowledged alcoholic.  She reminds me a lot of Siebold,  except she's family !!!  Scary, isn't it?!?!?!  LOL, we finally ducked out of there about 2:00 p.m. and went to the airport.  We flew Southwest 835 from BWI back to Nashville.  It left a little bit later than its scheduled time of 5:50 p.m. and arrived in Nashvlle about 6:30 p.m.  We got out bags, got in the car, and got home.  It was an awesome trip! 
 Some things I noticed about D.C. were: 
  In the D.C.-area, pedestrians legally have the right-of-way.  That's not remarkeable, except the law is actually followed.  Around Metro stops when people walk out into the road,  all  the cars stop.  No one has to run across street for fear the crazy drivers will run them down.  Everyone knows that the drivers will stop for them.  It's really hard to change from being a Nashville pedestrian who's used to sprinting across streets to being in D.C. where the cars stop. 
 Okay, this isn't really about D.C. in general but the girls at AU are really hot.  Plus, there's a 60-40 ratio of girls to guys at AU. 
 There is always something going on in D.C. 
 There's no need to have a car in D.C.  They are too much of a hassle.  Rush hour is 24 hours a day and there are about 13 parking spaces in the entire city.  Plus, the Metro and Metro Bus system are really good.  The MTA (Nashville) map of bus routes matches the Metro (subway) route in D.C.  The Metro Bus system runs practically every two blocks.  Public transportation in Nashville sucks ass; it's a way-of-life in D.C.  There are no where near as many trucks, proportionally, in D.C. as there are in Nashville.  If in Nashville there are 5 trucks per car, in D.C. there are 50 cars for every truck.  Hmmmm, are cars more fuel-efficient or something?    
 Enewayz, Jerry didn't get Jessica's number for me while I was out.  He said he would have but that stupid Troy was talking to her at the time and he didn't want to approach her for me with him around; I completely understand.  I just really hope that she doesn't see anything in him; I think he's scum. 
 Well, was this post long enough?  Good, I hope it was.  But I have to be gettin' to bed now, I've got school in the morning. 
 George out.

        Aite, I'm home from Dad's house, but will be leaving soon for Ashland City.  I'm riding out with Shana to see Camille.   If  Shana ever gets out of work and calls me.  Grrr, she needs to call A.S.A.P. 
 Enewayz, church was pretty cool today.  Kinda.  Well, it reminded me of how unique my church is.  I was heading for Sunday School when a parent told me everyone was in the sanctuary and I needed to go there to get my scripture reading because the youth/children were doing the service today.  When I got up there I found out that I was going to have to sing "Let There Be Peace On Earth" with a whole bunch of 5-9 year olds and a few other "older" (read: middle and high school age) youth.  I was kinda pissed.  But I did that and after we sang (with the little ones sounding awful!) the entire sanctuary was dead silent.  To quote Mr. Barnes, you coulda heard "a mouse tipping on cotton." 
 But that's not the real reason why East End is so great.  During the prayer requests there were three requests that were, shall I say, unique.  One was from a little 8-year old girl praying for some endangered species because "According to my research..." (and she proceeded to tell about her research).  Her mother disappeared behind a pew she was laughing so hard, as was nearly everyone else in the room.  The pastor very skillfully said "Thank you, let's pray for all the endangered species."  Then, a man from one of the neighborhood half-way houses stood up and began, "I, uh, I don't really know where to begin.  ...  I'd like to become the President of the United States.  (complete silence)  I, uh, I've had this dream since I was fourteen years old and, well, I've always been kinda afraid of it.  I want to be President because of all the good things he can do.  I want to do those good things.  ..."  And he proceeded from there.  It was pretty sad because he said that after his "accident" he hasn't been able to follow his dream.  The thing about this man's prayer request was the the way he began sounded like he was going to say he wanted to join the church, or something simple like that.  The third "unique" thing about my church was when Francis Meeker stood up and gave us her weekly update on her life.  She will be flying Thursday on American Airlines to Chicago, form Chicago to Amsterdam on Kuwaiti Airlines, from Amsterdam to Kuwait City on Kuwaiti Airlines, spending three days in Kuwait City and then flying on a U.S. Army plane to Baghdad Airport so she can spend time with her daughter who is serving in the Army in the Kuwaiti/Iraqi area. 
 Enewayz, I love my church and Shana is coming soon so I have to go.  I'll be in Ashland City in about half an hour. 
 George out.

        Man, I took the SAT this morning.  I was at Hume-Fogg for nearly 4.5 hours.  That's a long ass time for a single test on a Saturday.  Ya know?  Enewayz, I actually think I did very well.  I thought the math was very easy, almost simplistic.  Which of course had me asking "is this too easy? Am I missing something?"  I hate it when I start to second-guess myself when I think I'm doing well.  I think something that really helped was the fact that I knew the format of the test and knew better ways of taking the test.  I didn't read the directions; I knew that the harder questions came after the easier question; I knew that skipping questions made less sense that accepting the gamble of an incorrect answer; I knew that one of the sections wouldn't score (it's used as a key to make sure the test is scored fairly for the pool that took it today); I knew that the key section was one of the verbal sections, which hopefully means that my verbal score will be slightly better because I usually feel weaker in verbal.  I'm pretty sure that my knowledge of the test helped me perform better, which should hopefully translate into a higher score.  I'm shooting for a score of 1400 or better which would be a nearly 200 point jump, from 1230 to 1400+.  It's not unheard of, but quite difficult once you get into these higher scores. 
 I'm taking the ACT in two weeks and am shooting for a two or three point gain, from a 30 to a 32 or 33.  I want the 32 because that would tie with Ms. DeSha's score and a 33 because it would beat it.  My thirty tied with Ms. Daily which gave me immense satisfaction because I know I'm better than her and, well, it made me feel better about having to go into her class every morning last year.  LOL, I crack myself up. 
 Enewayz, I'm gonna go now and work on redesigning the border frames for the school website.  Ms. Purcell-Orleck wants me to use a  deeper red  rather than the  red that's in use now .  She wanted to use a maroon color, but I vetoed that because East's colors are  red  and white/gray and  not  maroon.  I also said I preferred the  lighter/brighter red  to the  deeper one  because East is flashier but the deeper is classier, so I'll try both.

        Alrighty, I'm over at Dad's house right now. 
 I haven't updated in a while because I've been really tired.  I really don't like to complain, because everyone complains that I'm complaining but I think I can be pissy for a week out of a year.  Right?  Good. 
 Yesterday was not a good day.  I was really tired and didn't get in until about 8:00 p.m.  I went to a cross-country all-city meet.  It was fun and all, but I really should have gone home right after school and done homework and gone to bed early.  But I didn't.  And I can't change that. 
 Enewayz, I was done with cross-country about 6:30 but I had to go over to Dad's because Mom is out of town and I was having dinner with Dad.  I did a little bit of Calculus after dinner and went home after that.  But before I left, Dominique called and asked about the World Cultures, which forced me to notice that I had left my book, with all the notes for a test in it, at school.  Once I got home I called Ms. DeSha and found the address for the website that the notes came from; Shonta' emailed me the assignment.  I didn't finish all the stuff I had to do before I went to bed and when I got up I finished the work.  I got to school about 8:10 a.m. and when I got to Ms. Anthony's class everyone was eating all kinds of stuff that Ms. Anthony had brought because we, as a class, all turned in our outlines.  She also had it announced on the announcements Thursday afternoon.  Isn't that sooo strange?  Like, she got really excited about such a silly thing.  Enewayz, I thought it was rather silly.  Don't you agree?  I thought so. 
 Also, about Jessica, I was in Ms. Spears room right before Jessica's class returned from lunch and I walked past her when I left but as she was passing me she had her head turned and her mouth was shaped like she was saying "Do, do, do."  I kinda took that as a hint that she didn't really want me to talk to her, plus I was kinda scared to, so I didn't.  I'm such a puss.  Geez, I get on my nerves.  Isn't that annoying when you get on your own nerves?  Yes, yes it is.  Grrr...I really need to stop being such a puss and just talk to her.  I almost went up to her friend Lydia and asked her if Jessica had a boyfriend, but I decided against it (because I'm such a puss). 
 Also, Fernando wasn't at school yesterday and I asked him why when he got online yesterday evening.  He told me he'd fractured both of his elbows but told me to not tell Dana at all.  I thought it was rather strange but the funny thing was when he asked me if Dana was getting online.  I told him "Yes, she told me she'd be online from 9:17 until 10:28."  He didn't think it was very funny and quit talking to me.  I thought it was pretty darned funny that he got all pissy about it when he was the one that asked the damned ridiculous question.  I mean, come on, how often do you tell someone that you'll be online at a certain time?  How often do you tell someone you'll be getting on at all?  I didn't think so.  It's just something that happens; one simply happens to be online the same time as someone else and talks to them then.  If it's important enough and the person you need to talk to isn't online, you call them.  *Shudder*  What a concept!!!  And don't tell me he can't call because he doesn't speak English, he's told me that he's called before (whether or not it's the truth I don't know). 
 Grrr, I really don't like him, he's such an annoyance for someone I didn't even know existed two months ago.

          Great News Update:    Michelle told me about her conversation with Jessica earlier: Jessica:  Guess who called me  twice  this weekend? (with a smile!) Michelle:  George? Jessica:  Yeah. Michelle:  Do you want me to tell him to stop? Jessica:  No, it's fine. Isn't that good?!  I think it's purty darned good news.  I'm still gonna ask her the next time I talk to her if she minds me callin' and talkin' to her.  I've written a survey for all the ELMS high school students and an answer sheet for the teachers.  I ask a few questions about if students think the required standing during the Pledge of Allegiance is constitutional.  Boy is that gonna make some teachers mad.  But I think that it will help everyone because "knowledge is power" and the more knowledge one possesses the more well-protected anyone is.  That's my goal in this, along with learning what students know about their rights as students.  Enewayz, we'll see how this goes tomorrow.  I've got to write this damned paper now.  Ugh, I have  zero  motivation to write this crap.  Oh well, here I go...

        Y'all I just got the worst headache I've had in a long ass while.  Aaaahhhh, I need medicine that works.  The ibuprofin isn't working yet, I need the Imitrex.  Grrrr, my head is about to explode.  It hurts to be alive.  And yet I have to be.  I've got an assload of work to do (Senior Thesis).  I've also got a stressful time with my application to AU.  I just gave the financial aid application to my mom with instructions to have it returned by Wednesday and she started trippin' out about how whenever I want her to do something it has to be done immediately but whenever she wants me to do something for her I put it off forever.  Ugh, I don't want to hear that.  She even said, "what if I don't do this for you?"  Well, if she doesn't then I don't get need-based financial aid from American University.  Hmmm, yeah, I think she can get this  two-page  application to me by Wednesday.  BTW: I'm sending off my application to AU on Friday so they will definately have it before November 15.  Aaaaahhhh, I'm scared and my head hurts a lot.

        Well, I called Jessica today.  And we actually started talking.  And she asked me a difficult question: "I want to ask you a question, but don't think I'm trying to be mean, Why did you want to get my number?"  Uhhhh, hmmmm, exactly how do you answer a question like that?  I said something like, "Well, I wanted to get to know you because, ah, uh, I had seen you in the halls at school and was like wow and so I wanted to talk to you and get to know you and, well, here I am.  Is that okay?"  She said something like "Yeah."  Whoa!  That's a difficult question to come up with a half-decent answer in a short period of time.  I  shoulda  said she could ask if I could ask one to, "Do you mind me callin' you or would you rather I didn't?"  I think that woulda been a pretty fair trade, well, kinda.  Enewayz, after the question/answer moment we started talkin' about what we did last night and stuff like that.  Then she had a beep.  When she got back she said, "Um, that's Troy on the other line.  I'll hafta talk to you later."  Well, alrighty then, I think I'll  try  to talk to her Monday at school but I'm gonna try to get  her  to call  me .  We'll see what happens.  And, as always, I'll keep you posted.  In funny news for today, Mom and I were driving through the intersection at W. Eastland/Cleveland and McFerin and there were people in the road begging for money (representing a cause).  The cause they were representing:  " Adopt-A-Addict "  Isn't that hilarious?  Are they gonna buy the drugs for the addicts so the addicts don't have to turn to crime to support their habits?  (BTW:  Does anyone notice the gramatical error in the cause's name?  It should be "Adopt- an -Addict.")  Well, I've got to go clean my room, mow the lawn, and sweep off the front porch and sidewalks.  Grrr!

        Here's my monthly Romantic Forecast (Zodiac - Virgo) from  urlLink astrology.com .  You may be more demanding than usual on the 1st, 27th and 28th, but if your date or mate doesn't want to tend to your needs on these days, there's probably someone else who will. You love to play mind games with potential love interests on the 4th, 5th and 6th, but be careful of playing hard-to-get because it may backfire. A night spent at home with your sweetie is more romantic than being wined and dined at a fancy restaurant on the 7th and 8th. You don't mind being spoiled and pampered on the 9th through 11th. You're more realistic than idealistic on the 12th and 13th, but if you use your creativity on the 18th and 19th, you should be able to silence someone who was critical of your (perceived) inability to be romantic earlier in the month. You like to push the envelope a bit when it comes to experimentation on the 22nd and 23rd, but it's extremely important not to do anything that might make your partner or date feel uncomfortable. Use the 24th, 25th and 26th to vent your frustrations or to declare your love for someone, but keep your emotions a little more reined in on the 29th through 31st.

 Wow, today just isn't a good day. 
 Here are all the strikes against me:
 
 The school website has crashed--the server is working but all you get on the web is "Error. File not found." 
 I am nearly single-handedly doing this Student/Faculty Basketball game--even though the sophomores refused to give it up. 
 Mrs. Szklany-Brown lost one of my assignments and gave me a zero for it and when I went home to print it off again it turned out I had only printed notes--not the real assignment. No one remembered me doing the work and she just told me that she didn't care. 
 I've got a pimple on my nose. 
 I have no woman and I'm beginning to feel discouraged just b/c of the lack of anything going on. 
 I'm ridiculously busy for it being my senior year. Isn't this year supposed to be the easiest year of school? 
 I went to bed at about 2:00 a.m. last night (this morning?). 
 As I was heading to bed at 10:30 p.m. last night I saw some of Shont&aacute's hair on my pillow and then noticed the ruffled sheets. 
 I had just washed those sheets but then I couldn't sleep on them; I still haven't been able to wash them because I've been busy with other things. 
 Tonight will be the second night that I will not sleep in my bed--I tried the recliner last night and it worked okay, just kinda chilly. 
 
 
 And, that's about it, a solid list of ten reasons why today has not been my day. Any questions? 
 Good, I'm going to bed. Oh wait, I've got to do that damned assigment for English. And, since Lent began today I'm not supposed to be cussing. I decided to give that up for Lent and y'all see what kind of "stuff" is being thrown at me to test me. 
 Good night, world.

        Well, I just really pissed my Mom off. It's just I really get sick and tired of her saying that I'm going to MTSU or Austin-Peay. Helloooo, has anyone ever heard of positive reinforcement? Yeah, that means you're encouraging in bad situations, not telling them that all hope is lost and you're not going to go anywhere in life. Gee, thanks Mom, for all your support. Would you like me to just throw my hands up and say "Yeah, I'm going to Austin-Peay or MTSU? Just so you won't have to waste your precious money on American because I obviously won't rise to your expectations and will simply be a waste of money."  Fuck that, I'm gonna do some homework or just rant some more.

 Okay, another thing about this situation is that I was told by people that going with Lauren was impossible, that they didn't think I would have a good time with her, that I was setting myself up for failure, and that it was just a lost cause. Well, you know what, I've been told that my entire life and I wanted to prove them wrong with this one; this was my final shot for Lauren and I wanted to try and give it my all and be successful. I didn't want to just try, I wanted to succeed. I wanted to prove everyone wrong that said it wasn't even possible, I mean, have some faith, or at least pretend for me. Damn, I guess I'll just have to show everyone "when I make it big..."

 Did I mention how much I hate to hear that "she doesn't know what she's missing out on. You're a real keeper and she'll figure that out later in life when you make it big. Besides, high school girls rarely know how to pick the 'good' guys. They'll come to their senses later in life. And, when you make it big and are really successful and have all the women fighting for your glance then all the ones from high school are gonna feel really stupid"? Did I mention that that annoys the fuck out of me? Off me some damned good advice, not wishes for the future.

 Nope 
 Well, Ms. Filson-Staggs talked to Lauren and Lauren is going to Prom with her boyfriend from Friendship Christian. Pooo for me! So, I guess I'm going with Camille. 
 Well, I'm about to go out to the soccer game and then possibly the softball game. Although I'm not really in the mood for either. 
 Oh well, life goes on...and I'm glad I attempted. 
 Clarification: No, I haven't actually asked Lauren, yet.

 Goodbye, Friend 
 Well, I think I've just ended a friendship of 7.5 years! Oh well, y'all can read about it here, and, No, I'm not sad about it at all; he'll come to his senses later, maybe once he stops getting pussy! 
   GeoDeeJr  (8:29:45 PM): okay, let's talk 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:29:51 PM): but we gotta have some ground rules 1st 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:30:10 PM): first of all, if u say something, u can't immediately sign off--give time for a response 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:30:26 PM): and, we both have 2 b nice 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:30:29 PM): k? 
 DejaiSavade  (8:30:47 PM): w.e 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:30:52 PM): aite?

 GeoDeeJr  (8:33:07 PM): and u got what i was saying about respecting people, especially about u 2 being a lil' 2 cozy when ur supposed 2 b teaching 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:33:10 PM): or in meetings 
 DejaiSavade  (8:33:29 PM): hold on what are you talking about "teaching" 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:33:38 PM): u and shonta' being teachers 
 DejaiSavade  (8:33:49 PM): u dont know ne thing about it so what are you talking about 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:33:54 PM): o right 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:34:15 PM): u 2 being all up in each others lap shows absolutely NO respect 4 the class, u know that 
 DejaiSavade  (8:34:32 PM): and where do u get this information from 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:34:33 PM): but since i know nothing, am i just supposed 2 not b ur friend and offer u some cordial advice 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:34:45 PM): damn, do people at school not talk? 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:34:48 PM): everyone talks about it 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:34:51 PM): it's annoying everyone

 GeoDeeJr  (8:36:17 PM): then we both choose not 2 share stuff 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:36:28 PM): besides, everyone involves a lot of people complaining about it and things i overhear 
 DejaiSavade  (8:36:49 PM): look i am tired of playing your games, unless u come straight i have nothing to talk to you about 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:36:51 PM): basically, no one cares 2 see u 2 that comfortable w/each other 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:37:14 PM): and why is that i have 2 come straight and tell u everything when u dont even have the decency 2 tell me anything?! 
 DejaiSavade  (8:37:50 PM): B/C U HAVE THE BIGGEST MOUTH ON EARTH THATS Y, AND U LOVE TO INSTIGATE THINGS THATS Y 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:37:59 PM): instigate?!

 DejaiSavade  (8:38:07 PM): yea thats what i said 
 DejaiSavade  (8:38:29 PM): obviously the people who you talk to are now seeing the truth behind what you and tasha are doing 
 DejaiSavade  (8:38:34 PM): your game is over 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:38:45 PM): it ain't no game, except what shonta' is doing 2 u 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:38:50 PM): r u that blind?! 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:39:03 PM): r u so blind 2 not see that u r in the same situation every other week w/shonta'? 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:39:19 PM): ur story would make a great movie 
 DejaiSavade  (8:39:29 PM): obviously not as blind as you are, b/c ur so called friends have found out what you are doing, it just took them some time 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:39:44 PM): oh yeah, like who? and what are their miraculous discoveries? 
 DejaiSavade  (8:40:00 PM): that you are nothing but a liar 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:40:32 PM): man, fuck it then, if that's what u want 2 believe, then don't come cryin 2 me when u and shonta' break up, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:40:40 PM): like u always do 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:40:45 PM): hmm, c a pattern here? 
 DejaiSavade  (8:41:21 PM): so if u need something to go back and tell desha and tasha, you tell them that i quit, b/c i am sick of dealing w/ your (you and tasha's) hypocriticalness 
 DejaiSavade  (8:41:40 PM): that should give you something to instigate, lets c how far you strecth this 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:41:41 PM): nah, i'll let u think about it and tell them next week 
 DejaiSavade  (8:41:51 PM): i dont have to tell you all ne thing 
 DejaiSavade  (8:42:01 PM): b a leader and fix this "leader" 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:42:10 PM): o shut up and think about it, "teacher" 
 DejaiSavade  (8:43:15 PM): no i am so serious, i am through dealing w/ you all, find someone who actually is dumb enough to continue to listen to the bull that the so called coordinators george and tasha have to say, seeing how they follow nothing that they try to preach to the choir 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:43:35 PM): and u dare say that ur so perfect, MINISTER?! 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:43:51 PM): r u married, sir? 
 DejaiSavade  (8:44:30 PM): dont put your fault on me, if u think you are a leader, u need to learn how to b one, b4 you try again 
 GeoDeeJr  (8:44:49 PM): okay, minister, ignore that 
 DejaiSavade  (8:47:05 PM): well, listen, u can go under the little protection of desha b/c she is the only one buying your little games, i hope your anti bias crap turns out the way you hoped 4 it too, other than that i have nothing more to say to you until you learn how to talk to PEOPLE like you have some since, so go run off and tell this to whoever you so choose. 
 DejaiSavade  signed off at 8:47:35 PM.   
 And, just to reiterate, for those not knowledgeable about the Bible,   premarital sex is a sin  ...even for MINISTERS!!! 
 Basically, Jerry is so damned brainwashed by Shont&aacute that he can't even see people that are trying to help him. Not only that, once he gets back with Shont&aacute and starts to get pussy again, he cuts off everyone that has stood by him during all those times that Shont&aacute has dumped him for another man! Jerry, you're full of shit,  you are the only one who isn't seeing through lies, SHONT&Aacute'S LIES!!!  
 Jerry's Response To Yesterday's Email 
 Here are Jerry's two emails that he responded to mine (you can read that below). 
 The first email, at 4:50 p.m. today, reads:  Well, u've had your say, and i c what u are saying.  Now, i think its about time u hear me, i through talking about this w/ you.  If u feel that u dont have the proper amount of respect in ur little anti bias stuff, fine, i quit, so u can focus on the ones that give u what you want.  The second email, sent at 5:08 p.m., reads:  Forget about the letter that i just sent u.  Just b/c there are issues between us does not mean that i dont want to b a facilitator, and now the only way that i will not be one is if i am cut from being one.  So if u all decide to do that, its on you, either way it does not matter w/ me.  
 Just to clarify the time issues, I sent the big email (from the earlier blog post) yesterday night, I received these two emails this evening (about 8:15 p.m. or so), and then IM'd Jerry the conversation above. 
 To Jerry: Don't come knocking, when she leaves your ass AGAIN!

   You're  Catch-22 !  by Joseph Heller    Incredibly witty and funny, you have a taste for irony in all that you see. It seems that life has put you in perpetually untenable situations, and your sense of humor is all that gets you through them. These experiences have also made you an ardent pacifist, though you present your message with tongue sewn into cheek. You could coin a phrase that replaces the word &quot;paradox&quot; for millions of people.    Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .

 New Feature 
 In response to weird/different people and situations in my life, I'm creating a new feature for my blog entitled "Folks Diff'rent From Me." This feature will  hopefully  not appear regularly but will award people and things in my life that are different from what I'm used to and what I'd expect of a situation. The honor of the first Folks Diff'rent From Me Award goes to Dana and her parents. 
 First Folks Diff'rent From Me Award 
 Dana is a freshman living here in Nashville. Fifteen years old with a rather nice body but still a fifteen year old freshman, right? Her boyfriend is a junior that lives in ... South Carolina. Yes, South Carolina the state. 
 Her mother not only knows about this relationship that goes back to December(?) but  approves of it . Even more interesting is the fact that Dana's birthday present was, drum roll please, her boyfriend flown up to Nashville for a weekend! And, guess where he stayed for the weekend? Yeap, her house! 
 Over spring break, guess what Dana did? She saved up her money and flew herself (and sister) down to South Carolina for the week. This time, however, Dana stayed at her grandparent's house, not 24-7 in her boyfriend's arms. 
 Later, the week before East's Prom, Dana flew down to South Carolina for her boyfriend's Prom. 
 And, as we speak, Dana's boyfriend is chilling in her house for this entire week! 
 Now, if you ask me, which they did not, if I were the boyfriend of an attractive girl who I was flying to see, I'd be expecting a little more than smoochie-smoochie on tha cheek, if ya know what I mean. And, if I were the parent, which I'm not, then I don't think I'd approve of my little girl having a serious, long-distance relationship while she is a freshman in high school. 
 Dana and her parents are definately Folks Diff'rent From Me and the first receipients of this prestigious award. Congratulations, now remind me not to get like this.

 End? 
 Well, I'm sure y'all saw the title of this post and got excited, right? No? Oh well, I don't care that much, I just wanted to let y'all know that tomorrow morning at 8:45 a.m. I will be undergoing wisdom tooth surgery. All four of my wisdom teeth will be removed. 
 On a more positive note, I've got a shitload of drugs that will be knocking my ass out before the surgeon touches my mouth. Tonight I'm taking a sleeping pill and again tomorrow morning. When I get to the oral surgeon's office, they'll be giving me Nitrous Oxide (Lauging Gas) to get me further loosened up before they give me an I.V. of something that will knock me out completely. That way I won't even know anything is going on until I wake up. After the surgery, I've got a two-day supply of some kind of pain medicine. 
 Pissed Off 
 Camille still hasn't called me and now I'm just wondering how long she's going to think I'm mad at her and not call me. The thing is, I'm not mad about her missing Graduation, I doubt there was much she could have done about that ... I'm mad about how she has not called me  at all . 
 Lovely Luisana 
 Before I forget, I was watching the news about a week ago; it was a story about a local event supporting the  urlLink Dream Act . I'm barely paying attention and dozing off to sleep when I notice Luisana at the event! That reminded me of how I really needed to get back in touch with her and all that. Well, Anytown is coming up, right? Soooo, most Minitowners go to Anytown, right? Usually. Except, Friday when I had dinner with Tasha and Tommy about Anytown (our counselor "training"), he gave us the incomplete list of people who'd applied for camp: Luisana wasn't on it and when Hispanic recruitment came up in conversation and her name, specifically, Tommy said that she hadn't applied but that he was going to call her to see if she wanted to go. &lt;fingers crossed&gt;

 If you would like to see the Berg Murder Video and cannot get it from a website (I know  urlLink The Memory Hole  is down right now) then you can IM me for a copy of the video. And, just as a reminder, the video is nearly six minutes long and ends in very graphic violence -- it ain't no video game, it's the real thing.

        What's Up?  Something very weird is going on and I can't quite put my fingers on it. For some reason I'm really thinking something supernatural is going on right now, around, with, and through me.  Here are some odd things that have been happening:  Yesterday in the cafeteria during fifth period, Caleb told me across the table that he had a question for me. I said "Okay" but he said it was private.  All day while I was at school today, there didn't seem to be anyone there; I hardly noticed the presense of students although it was a full and regular school day for grades 5-11.  My cat was killed two days ago. (BTW, if you pick up a copy of today's  Tennessean  you can find a letter to the editor that I wrote about dogs killing my cats.)  This evening I was walking out of a darkened room and my phone's backlight was on (not the weird part). The weird thing was how there appeared to be a light trail around my phone that followed it. I logically deduced (through some experimentation) it was simply the backlight playing tricks on me, but when it first happened, and afterwards, I was really freaked out.  For the past few days, Camille has been "really sick" and out of reach by phone -- she's been over at Ms. Susan's house because her house's air conditioning is broken, right? Well, I have not spoken with Camille in three or four days and not with her family in two days. For the past few days, when I've really been needing someone to talk to, no one has answered their house phone and her cell phone has been cut off. Where are you, Camille?  I just don't know what's up, and none of these things may seem weird to you at all, but for some reason they are all striking me as highly unusual.  I'll keep y'all posted, if I can ...

        Berg Beheading  I just watched the five minute video of Nick Berg's decapitation. Wow! That's some incredibly fucked up shit. The tape begins with Berg saying a few things about his family and where he's from and then one of the militants reads a long ass statement which ends with the group forcing a bound Berg to the floor and sawing off his head. I heard Berg's high-pitched screams just barely over the militants' shouts of "Allah!" Then, after they finish sawing his head off, they hold it high to prove it's been cut off. That shit is sooo fucked up; the government needs to save the rest of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse pictures for several years until Iraq is under control and successful. Then, only after the release of the pictures wouldn't be as big a deal, the pictures should be released.  And that's my story and I'm sticking to it.   BTW: You can see the video (which is  very  graphic and not for squemish people) at  urlLink The Memory Hole's website .

        Oh yeah, not only did Mom and Terry take Thomas to the pet clinic "to be put to sleep, but he died on the way," they went to the Inglewood Vegetable Market, to at least one thrift store, and Las Palmas restaurant ... yeah, big hurry on their part. Ya see, Mom didn't really like Thomas much because he was a real nervous cat and really acted like we were his servants, right? So, Trenton, the other cat, doted on her a lot more and was much more worshipful of her ... would she have taken as much time with him as she did Thomas ... ? Who knows ... except I liked Thomas.

        More Details About Thomas' Death  This afternoon, after a meeting with Ms. Stewart and others about Graduation, I called Elizabeth up and got her to take me out to the Rivergate Emergency Pet Clinic. I got out there and had to be buzzed in. When the lady asked what I wanted (because it wasn't business hours: 7 p.m. - 7 a.m.), I told her and she seemed kind of surprised at first because they weren't open when I told her that Thomas had been brought in ... hmm. I didn't think anything of it at the time, and she let me in and looked up to see if Thomas was there. Then, the lady told me that I might not be able to see him if they hadn't labeled his body in the freezer. So, she went in the back to see and I kinda paced around the waiting room. After a little time, she opened the door to Exam Room 1 and let me in. On the table was a thick brown plastic bag with a note on it that read "Donigan - Called To See Cat Will Come Later." I started to feel tears welling up as she cut the bag open. The way she was cutting it open I thought she was just going to open enough for me to peek in and then tell me to leave or something. But, she was nice, and opened it enough to see all of Thomas. I stood there for a bit before I reached in to touch him and she said "I'll give you some time alone" and left the room. The worst thing was that when she opened the bag and exposed his whole body, Thomas just looked like he was sleeping; he looked nice and warm and curled up in a ball like he'd done in my lap before ... I stayed in there for about ten minutes, just petting Thomas' head and just reflecting and stuff. I was cryin' and stuff, y'all know. After these ten minutes passed, I kissed my hand, placed it on Thomas' body, looked at him one last time and then walked out the door. Before I left the room, I tried to compose myself but when the lady said that she was "real sorry" I started to choke up again and tried to tell her the strongest "thank you" but it just kinda bubbled out with some tears. Then, I had to get back into the car with my sister and her friend for the ride back home. For the first five minutes on the ride, neither of them knew what to do/say so we sat just listening to the radio primarily.  Where's My Shotgun?  When I got dropped off at home, I was walking along the sidewalk to the stairs to my house and I noticed that Mr. Shelby (my neighbor two houses down) was waiting to turn in his driveway for a long time. I stopped and watched as these two little black boys (approximate ages 14 and 9) pull their black and white pit bull out of his driveway where it was bothering Mr. Shelby's neighbor's dogs. I just stood there in shock until I realized that this meant that something was going to be done about the problem because Mr. Shelby had become involved(!).  Later, when I was mowing the lawn, I saw in better detail all the places where our dogs have broken the fence down because of being agitated by pits on the other side of the fence, up my driveway at least 50-60 feet. I also noted at least three places where a dog had shat* in my driveways. Now, I find that highly insulting: First, these assholes own pit bulls. Second, these assholes are training their pits to be fighters. Third, these assholes are baiting their dogs against mine, who might lose a fight against more than one pit bull. Fourth, these assholes have allowed one of their dogs to kill my cat. Fifth, these assholes are not only walking in a definate private driveway, they are allowing their dogs to  shit in my damned yard . That's the biggest slap in the face if I ever saw one. You kill my animals and allow the killers to shit in my yard. Damn these people  Action  On a more positive note, the community is semi-mobilizing to take out these sorry excuses for human beings. Mr. Shelby called Larry (neighborhood association president) about the dogs in his driveway this afternoon and Larry called my mom tonight but ended up talking to me for about five or nine minutes. I told him my plan of setting up a sting operation of taking a bunch of pictures of these assholes  walking  training their dogs in my yard and then having them to show Metro Codes or Police. Also, I'm going to pick up a "No Trespassing" sign because without one, you can't file trespassing charges against someone. And don't get me started about the stupidity of that law ...  Goodbye, High School  Well, today was my last full day of high school. And, guess where I spent it ... in class? No! I spent it dealing with supposedly "grown" people and trying to fit close to 150 people on the small stage at school. We finally worked out a deal allowing both the band and choir to have their full memberships (67 and 42 members, respectively). The best part of it was a few of us spending most of the day planning how to build a curtain behind what's already there in order to make the stage large enough to fit the entire choir, entire band and entire faculty on stage for graduation. The compromise we worked out was that the band would be on stage, in full, along with the faculty split along the left and right sides of the stage with the choir singing from the floor in front of the stage.  Well, I'm gonna go to bed now and be ready to go to school about 9:00 a.m. tomorrow to voluntarily clean the auditorium for Graduation because right now it looks like shit. G'night.  Shat -  verb, past tense.  to shit

        I just called the emergency clinic and asked if there was any way I could see Thomas for the final time and she said that I could but he's been in a freezer since he was brought in so he could be "distorted." So, I'm going to think about it and possibly go out there tomorrow and see him once more.

 The Plot Thickens ... 
 Well, I'll be damned. Turns out that Terry found Thomas when he was painting at about 4:45 p.m. (I had left the house at about 4:40 p.m.) Thomas had wedged himself into this small crevice between two wooden fences and Terry called Mom to see what he should do. She told him to wait for her to get home before they did anything. So, at least  thirty  minutes later Mom gets home and they get Thomas out and into the car. Then, they have to drive through creeping rush-hour traffic to Rivergate for the clinic. Of course, because it had been at least an hour since the attack, Thomas died on the way. 
 So, there goes the timeline and lay of guilt ... aside from the damned pit bull owners/trainers. 
 In Comparison ... 
 When Charlie was attacked, in October 2002, I was watching T.V. and heard some strange yelping/screaming from outside the house. (It had just started to rain and I was waiting on Dad to pick me up for an NCCJ MiniTown training.) I lazily got up and went to the backyard and noticed my dogs strangely alert and intently watching something in the driveway. I went outside to look and saw two dogs and one of them holding Charlie in his mouth. He was shaking her body like a rag doll. I didn't know what to do at first but figured getting them to stop would be key, so I started yelling and clapping my hands. The dogs looked up at me, dropped Charlie, and ran. I went out to Charlie and saw she was really hurt, whimpering, and her sides were heaving up and down dramatically. I ran inside and called Mom and told her what happened. As I was telling her, I went back out to Charlie and remember Mom asking me if I thought she should come home to take Charlie to a vet. I told her "No, I don't think she's gonna make it for that long." Mom told me to go back inside and get a towel to bring Charlie inside, out of the rain. I got one of my mom's best white bath towels and went back outside and gently scooped Charlie up. I think she'd already died at this point because her sides had quit heaving, but I was talking to her and telling her it was going to be alright as I walked her inside. By the time I got back inside Charlie had died. I asked Mom where to put Charlie and she suggested the bathtub because it would keep Charlie from wandering and I told her that I didn't think that was necessary anymore. I laid Charlie down on the back porch floor and went to the front so I'd be able to see Dad pull up. He pulled up just as I got to the door and when he walked up I became speechless and mumbled out something about "Charlie ... dogs ... porch ..." and started tearing up. He didn't understand and said something about Bella and Chico (our dogs) so I just turned around and walked to the back porch. I got there and he was looking all past the porch into the backyard and stuff and I tried to tell him to look down but ended up just having to point. That's when he realized what I was talking about. Then, he hugged me and I cried into his shoulder for a bit. Then, without more time to say goodbye, I had to leave for the training. The next morning, before I was up for school, Mom left with Charlie's body for the vet to cremate. I never had a chance to say goodbye to her. 
 Looks like I can't say goodbye to Thomas, either.

 Damned Stupid People 
 Y'all wanna know the worst part about Thomas' death? It was  probably  caused by some damned pit bulls that someone in the neighborhood is training to be fighters by walking them and letting them bark at dogs in fences. This asshole probably saw Thomas and let his dogs "get some exercise/training." What in the fucking hell is the matter with people these days? I mean, Thomas had a damned collar on! It's not like he was just a friggin' stray cat, he was someone's house cat! He was our house cat! 
 Damn, why in the fucking hell would you train some damned dogs to be really fucking aggresive and "teach" them by attacking people's cats? Let me find these mother fuckers who killed my cat. Shit. Damned mother fuckers, I'd go borrow Mr. Shelby's shotgun and give them a taste of their own medicine, fuckin' animal killers. 
 Fuckers.

 Goodbye, Thomas 
 Damn, my cat got killed today by some damned dogs. This stray cat that had adopted our family and had become our house cat had been out for the past few days and Terry found him today injured after being attacked by some dogs. He and Mom took Thomas out to the Rivergate emergency vet clinic but he died on the way out there. Mom just called and told me. 
 Damn, what's up with rainy nights and our cats getting killed by dogs. Back in October of 2002, another cat, Charlie, was attacked by dogs pretty much right in front of me and died soon. That fucking sucked. Well, so does this, I really liked Thomas. In fact, I'm kinda surprised he got caught by dogs because he's such a nervous cat and all. Well, he was such a nervous cat. Damn, this fucking sucks. Oh yeah, like with Charlie, Mom has paid the vets to cremate the cat without allowing me to say goodbye. 
 Also, tomorrow is my last full day of high school, period. I think I'm gonna go to my room now and lay down.

 Dressing Room 
 Okay, I did like a good son should and tried on all the shorts that Mom bought me from the thrift store. I'm going to keep two pairs of shorts that are navy blue because I can wear them with some of my shirts but the faded brown, faded green and odd pleated denim ones I can't really see myself wearing. Unfortunately, I don't know how to get rid of them politely: I could tell Mom that I don't like them and she should give them to Terry (who would prolly wear them), I could tell her they "don't fit right" but she'd prolly ask to see them on me, or I could toss them into my closet until she forgets about them and I have a huge bag full of stuff to donate to a thrift store. I'll probably opt for the last option because the other ones risk hurting her feelings. 
 Damn, that makes me sound like I'm just too "good." I don't know, maybe it's how I was raised, but I'm supposed to be very appreciative of the fact that she got me something and I'm  supposed  to like it but, when you don't like something, the best possible solution would be to hide it until it's forgotten or wear it a couple times around the person before hiding it until forgotten. For example, for my birthday a couple years ago Dad gave me a $25 shirt from K-Mart that he boxed up really nicely and seemed to have taken time in picking out. Unfortunately, it was a deep purple (eggplant), thick velvety material that I quite simply wasn't going to wear. So, I hung it in my closet until this summer when I stuffed it into a nearly full contractor bag of items to donate to Goodwill; it still had the price tag on it. Ya see, I couldn't wear it because it was really ugly but I couldn't throw it away because it was a gift that was from the heart; I still feel bad that I got rid of it without wearing it, but I couldn't just store it forever (the thought did cross my mind). So, what exactly should I do in those kinds of situations? If I'd taken the shirt back and gotten $25, it wouldn't have been as meaningful and I'd have felt bad. If I'd pitched immediately, I'd have felt bad and he might have easily discovered it missing and inquire about it. So, I stored it for years until I figured he'd forgotten about it. Best possible solution, hopefully. Another example is another shirt I got from Dad from some trip he took to Toronto a few years ago, he brought me a shirt but it was too small for me to wear with dignity at the time. So, I stuffed it into one of my dresser drawers and hoped he wouldn't notice never seeing it. He asked about it a few times and I'd make up some excuse or another, being careful to avoid saying that I didn't like it (not true and would hurt his feelings) or that it didn't fit (true but would make him uncomfortable). So, earlier this summer, when I was cleanin' out my stuff, I came across the shirt and tried it on. Lo and behold, it fit. So, the next day that I knew I was going to be around Dad for a while (the Friday of one of his weekends) I wore the shirt and he commented along the lines of "haven't seen that in a while" knowing he hadn't seen it since he bought it. 
 Oh yeah, back to the shorts, I actually went to ask Mom about going to Wal-Mart for some shorts before I tried on those she got me. She told me that if she saw me actually wearing what she'd gotten me, then she'd "consider it". Well, since I try my best to be optimistic, and I'll keep bugging her about it, I'll hopefully have some new pairs of Wal-Mart shorts before the end of the summer. And, I might have some new shoes tomorrow after our trip to the cheap shoe store in Murfreesboro.

 Comments 
 Why the hell doesn't anyone ever comment on my posts? Is it that y'all don't know how? (Click where it says "Comments".) Or is it that no one actually reads my blog and I'm just ranting into empty space?! Argh, that would really frustrate me, if anyone is reading this, can you at least comment once that you exist and that I have some semblance of a readership? Thanks, I'd appreciate it very much. 
 EDIT: Please don't just comment on this post that "I read your blog" unless you have no other opinion to offer me about my other posts. Thanks!

 Only Two More Months 
 I have to keep telling myself that I'm leaving soon enough ... my mom and dad are driving me crazy! 
 Mom 
 Mom is one of those mothers that refuses to take actual responsibility for someone except for their accomplishments. Mom loves the fact that I get awards and stuff but can't stand the fact that I volunteer my time, do stuff outside of the house, don't trim her hedges and mow the lawn immediately after she requests it, etc. Not to mention the fact that, let's say, I tell her that I need some shorts for summer. So, rather than going to any store soon (as in w/in the month), Mom decides that she'll add that to the list of things I need for her next (of many) trip to a thrift store. A few days after I told her I needed shorts, she came home with six or seven pairs of shorts. Sounds good, right? Except most of them were what I would consider "dress shorts," if that's even possible. She even bought two pairs of shorts that were very colorfully striped, asking if I'd wear them. I declined the striped ones but accepted the others so as not to make her feel bad. And, tomorrow, we're finally going to get me some new shoes. (I've been begging for new shoes since, oh, about October/November 2003.) So, what store are we going to? "Marty & Liz" in Murfreesboro. "It's a great store where you can find $100 shoes for $10-25!!! It's just great! Blah! Blah! Blah! ..." And, whenever I ask for new shoes, if it's been less than six months or so since my last new pair, she asks why I need them ... my feet aren't bigger, the old ones are just fine. But, she always seems to forget the fact that since I have just a few pairs of shoes, it necessitates me wearing them quite often and, therefore, wearing them out faster. Duh! 
 Oh, and don't start thinking that I'm spoiled, when I want something "new" I'm not talking about something from a really expensive store in the mall (I don't even know a name to use as an example), I'm talking about, "why can't we go to WalMart and you let me get about four or five pairs of shorts off of their cheaper rack?" But, she doesn't seem to understand that (a) I don't like her picks of thrift store clothes for me and (b) that I detest spending hours in thrift stores with her and her boyfriend while they enjoy walking incredibly slow and picking at every single item. 
 So, this brings me to a bigger point of finances with Mom: She refuses to cosign my loan for college. Yes, I said  refuses  and, the sad thing is, I know the reason and it's incredibly shallow. Her "official" reason is that she has "taken care of" all my financial aid forms (I could do that if she'd let me) and she (through her work) is providing the Vanderbilt money that is covering much of my tuition. However, the Vandy tuition assistance money is not coming out of her paycheck; it's not an added burden to her that limits the amount of money she makes. Tuition assistance is a benefit of working at Vanderbilt that all employees of greater than five years receive. In other words, no matter how much (or little) she was paid, she would receive the money from Vandy. However, it's not that she receives the money, which could be her point, after filling out a little, one page form, the money is sent directly to American. So, why is she really not cosigning the loan? Because she doesn't want the "responsibility" if (she makes it sound like "when" but don't get me started w/that one) I fail. She doesn't want to have to pay off my loans if I become a drop-out or bum or somebody who can't pay their loans. Well, lemme see, am I planning on doing any of that? NO! And it's not like my loans are even that high, after four years of school I'll owe right around $50,000, I know that sounds like a lot now, but in reality it isn't that much. But, since she's "providing" the Vanderbilt money, she expects Dad to cosign the loan. I guess the most bothersome part of it all is that I feel it really shows her complete lack of faith in me, she doesn't believe I'll get good grades, she thinks I won't do my work, she thinks I'll be back at some Midstate school next year, she basically thinks that I'm going to fail. Mom doesn't seem to have a problem telling people that she expects me to be back next year. Yes, my mother is counting on me failing. 
 Dad 
 So, after that, what can be wrong with my Dad? Well, lol, where to begin ... ? 
 The first thing about Dad that bothers the hell out of me is that he doesn't take criticism kindly, wait, no, he doesn't take it at all! If I were to ever suggest that something he did bothered me, then he'd fly off in a tissy and get ultra-angry and it wouldn't make it worth it at all. And, it's not very hard to say something that doesn't 100% agree with him; I could easily piss him off two dozen times in one day, if I weren't careful. Another thing is that he jumps to conclusions way to easily. For example, everytime that I've been on the phone with him recently and haven't filled every moment with talk, he asks if he's made me angry at him and for me to just tell him why I'm mad. But, I'm not even angry (at the time), I might just not have anything to say at the moment. Basically, he can't take silence without it meaning that I'm angry at something he's done. Another example, this man takes offense if, at dinner, I'm not full of energy and talkative even though he won't say a word. Sometimes he'll get so angry that he'll storm off from the table and then return w/in a few minutes because he was still hungry (and probably quite embarrased). If it weren't so pathetic, it'd be rather funny. 
 That's the thing about Dad, most of the things that he does would be hilariously funny if it weren't so pathetic. Well, maybe not hilariously funny, but amusing, in the least. Whenever someone is over at the house, even if it's just to pick up a book, he'll want to show that person his Andy Warhol religious art books or play his Armenian Duduk (a double-reeded wind instrument similar to a clarinet, except more primitive). 
 Another problem of Dad's is that he has money problems and complains about them a lot but rarely hesitates to spend money on something expensive and quite trivial. He has spent a lot of money on expensive pots and pans "because they work better" (and look nicer than cheaper ones). He buys drapery and linens from expensive stores/mail order catalogs but can't buy himself a real size (bigger than twin) bed. He buys fake crab meat and speacialty lettuces without buying sandwich bread. He buys lots and lots of flowers but, once again, won't buy himself a bed. And, don't suggest that he doesn't want the bed, he complains about the small bed he has now all the time and even tells others about how he "can't even buy himself a bed" as a joke. Of course, another side of this problem is that he tries to be generous with his money but he really doesn't have anything to give, except a credit card number. For example, when Mom refused to pay for my class ring "because I told her I would get the money but wasn't able to get a job" Dad paid for it "as a loan." When it came graduation time, Dad kept asking what I wanted as a gift and I never gave him a straight answer because I didn't want to ask for anything big from him to make him feel bad or ask for something little to trivialize him. So, eventually, he asked if a class ring would be a good gift. It was because I really had no idea how to pay for that and a computer with the job I was expecting to get after graduation. Unfortunately, he really didn't have the money nor does he have the money now to pay for a $400 class ring on his credit card. Another thing that makes me feel really bad about doing but necessary is that if I mention that Mom still hasn't gotten me shoes and it's been many, many months since new shoes, he'll go out to a regular shoe store and get me something. He'd probably even take me clothes shopping, if I asked, I just don't want him to spend his money on me. 
 Ya see, the reason I know about his financial troubles is because he tells me about how much he pays Mom for child support (over a thousand a month for me and when it was all three of us kids it was over $1500 a month). He also makes very valid points about how Mom has no problem spending money ... as long as it's on herself and no one else. She can go shoe/clothing/car/etc shopping all she wants and spend whatever she wants. However, if I need it, NO! Knowing about the child support money makes me resent Mom's treatment of me even more because it has absolutely nothing to do with her lack of money, it's all on her lack of will. But, enough about money. 
 Another of Dad's general faults is that his attitude makes friendships for him difficult, causing him to talk to his children as if we were in his peer group. We aren't, we're his children. However, this doesn't prevent him from telling us all about any and everything going on in his life. Stuff we don't want to know, but if we were to object to hearing, he'd take offense and get mad, blah, blah, blah. Which takes me to an important cycle. Whenever it's my weekend over at Dad's house (everyother weekend), there is generally a distinct pattern of his attitude through the days. Friday evening, he's usually not very talkative and falls asleep in front of the tv, after cooking dinner in a thousand pots and expecting me to clean the dishes. Saturday begins, for him, before dawn and involves vacuuming the house, playing his saxophone, or turning his stereo up loudly, all before 9:00 a.m. The entire day he thinks I'm available to help him do whatever he needs done. If I've just gotten up and am reading the newspaper and eating breakfast but he needs me, I'm to drop everything and help him for the next three hours and then simply continue where I left off for ten minutes. Saturday night, if I want to leave the house (which I generally do), he insists I be home "not too late" (like 11 or 12). Then, if all I have time to do is ride along to pick up a couple friends before I have to be home, that's all I do. I come in the house rather noisily, too make sure he's awake, but he isn't and probably hasn't been for hours. Sunday morning involves him waking me up at 8:00 a.m. and giving me an hour to get ready for church. At church, he teaches my sunday school class. That ought to be enough said. After church, we always go back to his house for him to fix some type of meal involving a large amount of leftovers and other "not good" foods. Then I try to take a nap, but if he asks me about church at the meal and I don't give a wonderful, five-page oral essay analyzing the sermon and hymn choices, he'll get mad at me, banish me from his sight, and then promptly fall asleep in front of a baseball/football/basketball game on tv; I'll still go to my room and nap, if possible, but usually I'll be banished from his sight into the kitchen to wash, dry and put away all the dishes. What fun for a Sunday afternoon! Then, between 4:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m., I'll have my stuff packed up and ready to go back to Mom's house. Neither of us will be in the mood for conversation on the ride back and we'll get to Mom's and as he's leaving, he'll say something along the lines of "glad you could come by this weekend" in a semi-sarcastic, semi-serious tone of voice. That, my readers, is the weekend cycle at Dad's house. Now do y'all understand my away message when I'm over there: "I'm at my dad's house;  please  call me." So, from now on, if I'm over at my Dad's house, please call me and try to get me away for a few hours! 
 58 More Days, 58 More Days ... 
 Just another eight weeks and two days until I move to Washington. Yes, "move." Despite what Mom might tell you, I'm not planning on coming back (except for friends).

 Okay, my mom just told me over the phone that my dad was attacked while going for a run this morning. He was over near Bailey Middle School (w/in four blocks of his house) and four black guys (between ages 14-16) came up to him. One of them asked for a cigarette and when Dad told them that he didn't smoke they started to punch and kick him. Fortunately, a neighbor came out of their house to take out some garbage and saw what was going on and somehow managed to scare off the attackers. The police came, took Dad to the hospital and he's got a broken nose and lots of stiches. 
 They were probably going for money or something (maybe just for fun) but all that he had on him were his house keys. What the hell is wrong with society these days?

 It Sounds Worse Than It Is 
 I know this sounds really nasty, but it's all good. I just brushed my teeth for the first time since last Sunday. Doesn't that sound disgusting? LOL, naw, it's because of getting my wisdom teeth cut out and how I've had four wounds in my mouth since Monday. I've been real careful about what I've ate and used salt-water gargles and some prescription mouth wash whenever necessary. Surprisingly, I haven't needed to brush, not to mention the risk involved in a toothbrush ripping open one of the surgical sites. 
 Pleasant talk before I go back to the oral surgeon for a follow-up visit.

 I'm heading to DC today for orientation and will return to Nashville Monday. Orientation is Friday and Saturday, but Dad is "taking it slow" and we're visiting w/folks, too. Also, for the next two weeks I'll be at Dad's house for "vacation" (court ordered thing, I'll explain later) and prolly won't update anymore until I get back home.
