       June 28   That sums it up, actually.  The weekend was amusing, as far as weekends go.  I worked Saturday at the Codger Corral and got to swap "Good God, do you remember THAT whackjob resident?" stories with the Admin on duty. I have successfully avoided gross pink lipstick kisses for 2 weeks now, and consider that a record.    Sunday I picked up the official coffee mug d'Special Sauce, and glazed a rather large fish.  I'm rather hoping it comes out well.  Today I'm reveling in having 2 whole days off in a row, before I go to the office tomorrow.    Crafty Accomplishments this weekend:  1. Picked up and put a moss-stitch border on the bottom edge of the ground chuck sweater, will also do it on the sides of the back/fronts, because I like the way it looks (and coincidentally will make the pattern a tad wider because I am a moron.  A lazy moron at that. I think it will work to my advantage however.)  The bottom still rolls a bit, but once I have the thing finished, I will put a ribbon facing on it and that should cease.    2. The big ol' fish chimnea.   3. A quilt square that probably has a name, but since I didn't bother using a pattern, shall remain nameless.  It looks cute, and not bad for a first effort.  Consider me amazed.     House News:   I'm not dead yet.     Work News: I haven't killed anyone yet.   G Monkey and I had a delightful conversation on Friday night, after Cheddar Theater.  We've come to the conclusion that she cannot deal with the Big Boss indefinitely, and I will not deal with the Big Boss without Monkey.  So, we're going to work harder on our escape route, so when this organization pulls a Hindenburg, we've got something to fall back on.  (There's always the black market for human organs.) The whole topic is rather depressing, in a very "you don't need to be subjected to my whining" kind of way, so lets move on to...  Cheddar Theater News:  The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra was absolutely priceless.  (Although it did leave Monkey saying "It was good, but I could do it better") The T-Shirts were a hit, the cookies were delicious, and we've got some wicked good ideas for some side projects.    All told, perhaps not as boring as I had thought, then again, maybe you just had to be there.   More to come.

      Friday, 6/24.  Short post.  Have to go to work in a few minutes.  BB is freaking out because our creepy construction guy thinks the ceiling tiles we knocked down have asbestos in them.  (Highly unlikely, given the date of the previous remodel, which we can pinpoint to October of 1983.)She has declared Hell's Half Acre a no-entry zone till she gets the tile tested.  Great.  But for all her freaking out, we have already inhaled the fibers (if they are in the air) so the damage has been done.  And, if they do find asbestos in the house, she's going to have to hire someone else to clean it up, at great cost to her.    Had she not dragged Papa Sauce in the fray, I'd probably not be so pissed.  However, when she asked Monkey "Why didn't Papa Sauce TELL us there was asbestos in the tile?" When he wasn't in the house till it was taken down, I got a little irritated.  (And if I have to hear today, about her friends with asbestosis just one more time, I'm going on an asbestos induced strangling rampage.)   Honestly, I think the jackass contractor we hired is just trying to pad his bill.  He's a condescending creep, and I have a hard time with anyone who tries to get all "oh, look at what you GIRRRRRRRRRRLS did..." in that, "oh, next you'll want unicorns and rainbows, and a special place to put your Scott Baio shrine" tone of voice.  Thanks to Papa Sauce, I am reasonably knowledgeable when it comes to construction, and so is G. Monkey.  We're not "dumb girls" about construction. (car repair, yes, but construction, no.) Even after I did my walk through with him, and explained what we needed done, (and he saw how much of the demo work Monkey and I already did!) I swear this jerk was going to pat my head and ask "oh, and what MAN told you this needed done?" Grr.  The electrician, however, treated us like we had brains in our heads, which was a refreshing change.    Lesson here: Just because I have breasts doesn't mean I don't have a brain .  In fact, I have a spare in a jar under my desk.   Work beckons.

      Well, it was a Tuesday.  6/22/2004  That's about the only thing I can really tell you about today.  I'm spending tomorrow in the office, getting caught up on the boring shit that I didn't feel like dealing with while in the thick of the HHA overhaul.  We convinced the Big Boss that contractors are good, and paying someone to do things faster and better than we can do them is even better.  Yay.     Highlight of the day:  discovering the hideous carpet in the top floor wasn't covering linoleum.  Underneath the eyeball popping carpet we found a gorgeous cork floor in nearly pristine condition.  This made up for the bookshelves and random pieces of wood that were put up with nails just slightly larger than the ones used to attach Jeebus to the cross.  (I fear the original work was done by people whose parents were also siblings...)   Looking forward to Friday's installment of Cheddar Theater.  Not sure what we're watching, but we'll make something appropriately disgusting for a treat.  One of these days when I get enough time, I'll whip up a delicious  urlLink meat head   for zombie night.  G. Monkey and I have already planned out this year's Halloween party, and will start making bodies, limbs, and other repulsive delights.  Ah, sweet, sweet gore.  How I love thee.    On that note, off to work on the Ground Chuck Sweater.

       June 21   Actually, it started out as a fantastic day.  The Big Cheese likes what we've done with Hell's Half Acre (HHA) so far, and seems duly impressed.  (As she should be, we busted our asses on that place.) After grabbing some lunch, G. Monkey and I decided it'd be a good day for a field trip.  (Mondays are supposed to be our days off anyway.) So, while we were out looking for lights and crown molding for HHA, we decided we needed ice cream.  Mr. G. Monkey's birthday is Wednesday, so of course, we needed to find him a present, and somehow ended up at the glaze-your-own-pottery place.  We found Mr. Monkey a few other goodies as well and called it a day.     Then came the bad news...  My parents came out to look at HHA tonight (oh, how lovely it is to be related to a contractor, and a woman with impeccable taste!) The front room passed muster, but there is a lot more work that we didn't take into consideration that Papa Sauce says will need to be done.  *sigh*  If we have any hopes of getting into the building before our lecture series, we're going to have to do one of the following:           1.    Find brawnier interns (plural).  Cute little lit majors aren't usually equipped to hang drywall.        2.  Let the forces contained in the basement take over the   entire house, sucking it into some sort of evil vortex. (Preferably on a Monday, when G. Monkey and I aren't in the building.)        3.  Break down and hire some damned contractors so that G.         Monkey and I can try to wheedle donations out of the community.  (and work on the journals, and try to sell ads        and finalize the lecture series, and plan the exhibits,        and get some publicity going)       4.  Work around the clock, learning the finer points of     carpentry, drywalling and city code as we go along trying not to breathe too deeply so the mold spores don't kill us, and drop dead from some sort of house fungus before our opening date.   I'm hoping for option three (although option one isn't bad either.)   Oh, and before I get further into this thing...   The Special Sauce Glossary.    (Eventually to be prominently put somewhere or other.)   G. Monkey - my cohort, and quite possibly possessor of the other half of my brain.  She's the smart one, and is the one who lured me to work for...    The Fabulous Imploding Nonprofit Entity (FINE)  The ittybitty organization I work for.  If I told you what it was, I'd have to maim you, or not.  Perhaps I'm just hiding my true identity from...   The Big Boss - the other person who works for (and runs) the FINE. Swell person, but the linoleum curled a long time ago, if you get my drift.  The one who decided the FINE was moving to...   Hell's Half Acre - the historic building G. Monkey and I are trying desperately to remodel.  The people who turned it into a law firm did some of the worst half-assed construction I've seen in a while (They stopped short of using duct tape and brown paper bags to patch the holes).  Their descendants should be cursed with short thumbs and rashes that are impolite to scratch in public.  Also: Has mysterious blood-like spots in several places, probably lethal mold/lead paint and one super-creepy basement.  For the record , I shamelessly stole the name "Hell's Half Acre" from a column the incomprable  Paul T. Riddell  used to do.  With all the current events, it just fits.  More definitions as I see fit.  Stupid Stupid house.    Off to work on the Ground Chuck Sweater.

      Ah, another joyous night at the Codger Corral.  Having nothing to do except answer the phone and look pretty is something of a novelty.  I've been bringing my knitting to work on, and several residents have commented on the fact that my yarn looks like hamburger.  Henceforth, the sweater (which may take until fall to finish) shall be termed the "The Ground Chuck Cardigan"   For those of you who care about this kind of thing: The sweater is knitted from Encore DK that does bear a striking resemblance to  urlLink hamburger  (Scroll to bubblegum twist) Am making a fairly basic cardi, similar to the "matches everything" cardigan in the  Stitch & Bitch  book  Originally had planned to make it for the meat locker they call our "office", but the impending move to Hell's Half Acre has made this not nearly so pressing.       Side Note : Hell's Half Acre is a beautiful house  built in 1824, converted into 3 units in 1890, and remodeled in the late '60s.  It was blighted with ugly carpet, disgusting drop-ceilings, thousand-year-old linoleum, and a whole lot of suspsiciously blood-like spatters in odd spots of the front rooms.  We (My co-conspirator G. Monkey and I) are the slave laborers who are attempting to redecorate with some semblance of taste.  Our boss is back from vacation tomorrow, and will see what we've done so far.  Cross your fingers that she doesn't have a coronary.  (Although if she does, G. Monkey would be in charge.  I can think of worse things.)  End Side Note   At any rate, more as I see fit.  Yes, there will be funny.  Eventually.

      Ok, everybody else is doing it, so why not?  Of course, I can hear my first grade teacher's voice in the back of my head "If all your friends jumped off a bridge...?" Then again, she's the one who called me stupid, so Elvis only knows why I'd bother listening anyway.    No, I don't have a clue why I'm doing this.  Call it some sort of ego stroking, or perhaps a space that will eventually lead to bigger and better things.  I doubt highly anyone will read this with any great regularity anyway.  Most likely, this is just an excuse for me to screw around on the internet, and ostensibly work on writing. (And quite possibly kvetching, kvelling, and the occasional bit of venting too.)   Oh, the excitement.

      OK, so allow me to be political for a moment.&nbsp; I'm enjoying the coverage of the Democratic National Convention, but why, in the name of Elvis do you have to put Big Dog on at 10:30?&nbsp; Loved Al Gore (the duly-elected president of the United States), enjoyed the women senators (and believe me, Ms. Mikluski takes shit off noone), prayed to the deities that the changed lyrics to "Proud Mary" aren't going to be the Kerry/Edwards theme song, and I loved the Cow-Town tunes.&nbsp; But a girl should not have to wait until 10:30 to catch a glimpse of that pinup for chubby brunettes everywhere, Bill "Big Dog" Clinton.&nbsp; Seriously.   Anyway...  I have to go back to work tomorrow, and deal with the Big Bopper in all her bipolar glory.&nbsp; I am not looking forward to this. Kellog is looking for an HR assistant, which I could do with my eyes closed, so I may have to try for there.&nbsp; They'll certainly have decent benes, and I find it unlikely that I'd make less than I do now anywhere.&nbsp;  I'll keep you posted.   On the bright side, A.C. Moore had sock yarn marked down to ridiculously low prices, so I snagged some Magic Stripes- they didn't have sufficient quantities of Pattons in colors I liked.&nbsp; I got some nice rosewood needles too, marked down to $5.00 a pair- I snagged a 5 & 7, and will go back for more later, if I like them.&nbsp; woo!  Also, Michaels charges faaaaaaaar too much for Linea kits, and pearl cotton.&nbsp; Just saying.&nbsp;   Still lookin' for the Big Dog...

      Ok, remember that whole "good news" thing I was blathering on and on and on about in the last post?&nbsp; Just forget it.&nbsp; Pretend I never said it, because obviously, that's exactly what the big bopper decided to do when she went absolutely fucking batshit crazy on G. Monkey and me.&nbsp;   Not that I'm pissed or anything, no, the large quantities of Bass and Brooklyn Lager took care of the anger (and the vomiting took care of that bullimia I was hoping for).&nbsp; I'm just irritated, annoyed, and slightly amazed- I've never before worked with someone who was so obviously in need of medication and counseling.&nbsp; Sure, I've had bosses who were fucked in the head, but I'm talking about a woman who agreed with everything that was explained to her, and then went home, and in a paranoiac fit of lunacy, decided to recant everything she said.&nbsp; Oh, we can still get those raises, but not till October, and not until we make the business enough money to afford them.&nbsp; And G. Monkey can be the Executive Director, but isn't allowed to sign checks, or make any decisions.&nbsp; I can be the "executive assistant" not the "assistant director" and my coming to the organization wasn't to help bail them out, it was all a ruse, a clever plot to weasel more money out of the big bopper.&nbsp; Yep.&nbsp; The woman's rats.&nbsp;   Of course, I feel worst for G. Monkey, she put up with the big bopper for FOUR YEARS by herself.&nbsp; Four years.&nbsp; Just roll that off your tongue... fourrrrrrrrr yearrrrrrrrrrrrs, in close quarters, with a crazywoman.&nbsp; I don't know how the hell she did it.&nbsp; (Perhaps there are bodies in her basement that I don't know about.)&nbsp; Luckily, she has skills (mad skillz!) and can pick up a job fairly quickly, in Philadelphia, or take on enough freelance copy jobs to keep herself afloat, and we're working on our business plan tomorrow, so we can start something ourselves.&nbsp; In the meantime, I will polish up my resume, and get cracking.&nbsp; So, if you need someone cheerful, efficient, organized, and intelligent to help keep your office running smoothly, need a slightly cracked artistic type who would love to help you plan/cater your next event, or a shlub who can type really fast, I am indeed your woman.&nbsp; No reasonable offer will be refused.&nbsp; Medical insurance is a must, living wage required.&nbsp;   Feh!  On the bright side, I'm working on new aprons, and am apparently receiving a sewing cabinet from my parents for my Birthday.&nbsp; I'm designing the one I want- it's compact, looks like actual furniture, but will fold out to give me ample room for my mo-sheen, and cutting space.&nbsp; And, if anyone knows where to get flour-sack towels, please for the love of all that's holy, let me know, I'm trying some new embroidery projects, and cannot find flour sack towels for love or money.&nbsp; (in the midst of Amish country no less- nobody has the damn things)&nbsp;   Cross your fingers!

       Never before have I been so thrilled to have a $*()#! migraine.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Yesterday, after I left because of the aforementioned migraine, G. Monkey sensed it was time to 'splain the entire "we're about to implode and this is what we need to do" thing to the big bopper.&nbsp; Much to everyone's surprise, the big bopper not only agreed, but was foursquare in favor of&nbsp; every topic brought to her attention.&nbsp; She didn't know she had blown a sum larger than my annual salary (which is a pittance) on a pet project that has  nothing  to do with our mission.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  The bad news is that I won't see any extra fundage untill Halloween.&nbsp; All things considered, it could be worse.&nbsp; Now I can pick up shifts at the codger corral, knowing that it's for the short term.&nbsp; The bonus is I no longer have to be called the "secretary."&nbsp; Not to slam the secretarial profession, as I have done that, but the work I'm currently doing is oh-so-much-more than managing appointments and answering the phone.&nbsp; So now I get a title, business cards, and a shred of dignity.&nbsp; Yay me.&nbsp; (And Yay G. Monkey for makin' it happen.)     &nbsp;  So all the work I did for the presentation is not for naught, we'll adapt it to potential board members, and keep the budget.&nbsp; Now I get to plan a volunteer program!&nbsp; Cross your fingers!    &nbsp;  Still no new knitting news, think I will finish off the eons-old Magic Stripe socks, and perhaps cast on for new ones.&nbsp; Fall will be here before we know it, and finishing off something that does require a bit of a brain will be a bit of a mental boost.&nbsp; I'm hoping for yarn for the beeg birthday (cash will also be gladly accepted, and offerings of burly and/or&nbsp;smart and/or&nbsp;goofy men are always welcome.)&nbsp;     &nbsp;  For some fun, I recommend  urlLink http://fuggingitup.blogspot.com/ &nbsp;the queens of Fugging It Up.&nbsp; Snagged the link from Sars, highly enjoy the Fugstitutions and their fugcabulary.&nbsp; Also, Paul kicks a lot of ass over at &nbsp; urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/sclerotic_rings/ &nbsp;all while nurturing my inner science geek.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  And, for the friends I've finally sent the link to- you never call... you never write... you never send me marriage proposals anymore.&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp;

      ...are highly entertaining, yet wholly untrue.&nbsp;  &nbsp; To say I've been a little busy lately is merely an understatement.&nbsp; I have been developing, with G. Monkey a plan to hopefully save both our asses, and keep us from going completely insane at the 'ol job-a-roonie.  &nbsp; Lets just say that drafting a budget for a five-year-old company run by a woman who manages her money like a five year old, can be trying.&nbsp; Add in the joy that is developing a real, functioning board of directors, so we can maintain our nonprofit status, and trying to establish actual job descriptions so the big boss&nbsp;won't be up in my grill every fifteen seconds, and you can see I've got a lot of nights and weekends put into this thing.&nbsp; Proposal date is Friday the 23rd.&nbsp; I'll know then if I am going to get more money, and can stay employed, or if I'll be tendering my notice.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Other news: the house&nbsp;tiles don't have any asbestos, so I'm not going to die any earlier than planned- or at least not from asbestosis.&nbsp; Work on Hell's Half Acre has ground to a standstill (unless you count the big boss going over to cut up carpet, when she could have been selling advertising in the journal) since we have two journals to put to bed by August 10 (HA!), a direct mailer to send out, point of sale merchandising to put together and distribute, a discount program to plan, posters to put together, authors to contact, and spaces to wrangle.&nbsp; Oh, what an amusing few weeks this will be.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Knitting: since everyone else has an opinion on the Summer Knitty, I'll weigh in.&nbsp; (Pun, honestly not intended.)&nbsp; I saw exactly one and a half&nbsp;patterns I liked in this Knitty.&nbsp; (The nightgowns were both really cute- although the fabric &amp; knit one, I would probably just copy, in fabric only.) I really enjoy knitting, it's a great stress reliever and it's a great way for me to make something that I just wouldn't be able to find in a store.&nbsp; That said- I know I wouldn't be able to find a knitted bra, or thong in a store, and perhaps that's a damned  good  thing.&nbsp; I'm a big girl- I'll be the first to admit it.&nbsp; Frankly, I wouldn't want to see my boobs in a knitted bra.&nbsp; They'd be slappin' my knees, and generally flappin' all over the place.&nbsp;And the knitted thongs? Um. No.&nbsp; I&nbsp;really  like  my happy&nbsp;microfiber boyshorts, my ass was made to be covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they show you how to make a knitted girdle, and knitted steel I-beams, I think I will leave my lingere to Lane Bryant, and stick to knitting socks, if I want some custom intimate apparel.&nbsp; And the hand knitted licorice edible undies... I'm just disappointed they didn't tell you where you can get Monistat by the case if you use the damn things.&nbsp; Sugar and coochies do not mix.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Ground Chuck update: The sweater, she must be frogged.&nbsp; Disappointing, because I was up to 11 inches on the back, but it's just not wide enough.&nbsp; I was in denial, thinking I could add a seed-stitch border, but it's just not meant to be.&nbsp; I think it is too wide for a front panel, or I'd try to save it.&nbsp; I've put it aside for now, to show G. Monkey how to cast on- she learned to knit as a little kid, and it came back to her.&nbsp; I made a few froofy scarves that I may or may not give away/sell.&nbsp; It is tremendously satisfying to be able to finish a project in an hour and a half, but the large needles tend to fark the wrists.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Currently watching: Old episodes of Beverly Hills 90210, I Love the '90s, (sense a trend?) Poirot, the insides of my eyelids.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Currently reading: Stiff (just finished rereading it this morning), The Singer Book of Sewing and an ancient secretarial manual from when my mom went to Sec Tech.  &nbsp; Currently snacking: The Countess Tolousse Latrec's Chocolate Cake.&nbsp; Damn, that is some good cake.&nbsp; G. Monkey gave me the recipe.&nbsp; A pound of bittersweet chocolate, 4 eggs, a stick and a bit of butter, a tablespoon of sugar, and a tablespoon of flour combine to make one ungodly good cake.&nbsp; Fruit Salad.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Currently listening: The Beastie Boys- Pauls Boutique, Ben Folds Five- Rockin' the Suburbs, Sirius Music- First Wave ('80s new wave).&nbsp;  &nbsp; Sure, it was a long one, but it's done now.&nbsp;  &nbsp; More when I feel like it... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
