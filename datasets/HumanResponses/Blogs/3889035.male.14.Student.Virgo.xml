      The ability to look into your eyes  Is always a surprise  To gaze upon such beauty and not shun  to place my arms around ure hips And my mouth on your lips  To feel you and not run  When i'm holding you close  Is when i love life the most  To be one of cherished few  To even talk to you  When i see you my heart palpitates  And fear of loss penetrates  Although i have resistance  From you i could not distance  Its not just looks i see  But pure personality  Ive seen nothing of your likeness  And your gentle and meaningful caress  And when your gone  Everything feels wrong  Only one thing is what i can feel  No matter how much you scratch and peel  No matter what happens it can always heal  It is something i cannot express  But it is a bless  What i feel is love (hmm..couldnt get a good ending)  &nbsp;

      I never thought i would feel this way But i never thought it would be this bad till yesterday So many words i thought were true But they didnt come from you Slowly i slipped into it But what did i fall for You ran me over like i wasnt there yesterday It felt like icicles in my heart Just that little phrase of three Breath stopped and it hurt me Were all those sweet sayings a lie My heart was flying high But the higher it got the harder it fell And now its crashed into hell Fire and pain rages in and out It makes me wanna shout But only tears in form of sorrow escape my soul Every tear-drop a bit of reason for living falling away And with it goes my sanity Whenb i think im getting better I remember You ran me over like i wasnt there yesterday I slipped in and now i fade away

      Droning like mosquitoes they move close from far and ants of destruction trudge along strips of tar These sparrows also fly high Dropping packages of death from safety of sky Instead of stinging with pincers They use bullets of speed To death the lives they take they feed As they mow town after town They hear no cries of death sound For they are bound to heart and crest Asking them for king and country to embark killing fests Screams of pain follow in their wake Either from them or their enemies These pawns of long-lasting battle For years they from gun-fire or politician they hear the constant rattle Both try to stop the bloodshed For to long have they been fighting In the distance they search for a sighting One without blood and pain As the treaty is signed Here the freedom they long they find

      Its been at least 2 months since ive written poetry This poem is to elude the boredom that plagues me So many words to put down but they are hidden from me So much to write Whether out of curiosity or spite Insanity can posess me  But poetry is the key Paper has more patience than people Although it may lack emotion and be feeble It is still my best friend To which secrets i can send Some of my most inner thoughs have stained these pages Whether out of complacency or rages

      This site not nearly done So many words it weighs a ton As i watch the second hand tick Like im falling down an endless pit With a dog laying at my feet Giving it treat after treat This boredom cant be beat It burns holes in my heart Taking chunks of this valuable part People consider me insane But this is how i share my pain The words i write cannot explain I cannot make my feeling plain How to break this wall of fire Will my hand ever tire The world i wish are in this book The ones that no one ever took As i surf (and now u 2) all these pages I look at so many differant cages

      Drops of golden sun Bouncing off of me as i run Mingling with frightened tears As the ending nears I feel it taking me day and night Hidden away from sight Taking me from inside Taking my last and fatal ride This man in his cloak and his scythe gets nearer Making the end even clearer I feel myself slipping inside And no longer can i hide Deith veils my focus Like a swarm of locusts As i begin to cry I know its my turn to die

      This is a site about poetry These poems were written in a book originally Where i let my thoughts run free In this site i write what i think And with it i grow a stronger link In this site i can swim sink or fly I can write the truth and any lie When the feeling are pent up inside And i can no longer hide In this book i confide How my life resembles a roller-coaster ride Sometimes come a sudden fall Where one must stand tall Then come a steep hill Where on the other side lies another thrill Then it throws u tricky curves Which are stressing on your nerves But all those troubles disappear When i write in pages here

      Theres love in peoples hearts Love to share All by itself they cannot bear Dont let it get away There's love in this place This is one you have to chase Dont let chance slip Take a sip Of sweet love Oh sweet love The one thing that comes from above Oh sweet love No one wants to die Without someone to hold There's love meant to be set free Meant to meet someone new to see On other lives It thrives to be recognised Let it escape let it take shape Into the beauty of love let it soar let it with others love combine So devine The beauty of love Sweet love providing sorrow, grief and happiness Beautiful yet a cursed bless So let it bring you places youve never gone before Let it soar Oh sweet love
