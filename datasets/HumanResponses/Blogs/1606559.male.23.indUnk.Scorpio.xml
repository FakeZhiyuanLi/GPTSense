      members of ghosts, three inches of blood and  urlLink radio berlin  = one of canadas better up and coming bands.   urlLink FUCK ME USA!    besides the obvious political intonations, the heated name certainly matches their eruptive disco punk sound. like a faster, more desperate version of  urlLink the watchers . also with better vocals thanks to the oh so fashionable kayla guthrie!     though once im pretty sure i saw a photo of her in a COACH shirt.EWW  fuck me usa! record in november at hive studios ( urlLink a luna red ,  urlLink destroyer ,  urlLink young and sexy ,  urlLink hot hot heat ). its going to be HOT SHIT.  until then, listen to these 2 old demo tracks  urlLink here .

      hi my name is steve lam. im canadian and this is my music blog. NO, THAT IS NOT YOUR SIGNAL TO BOLT. i mean i know stuff! canada has *some* cred! paul anka put this town on the map! mad tv wouldnt be funny at all were it not for alanis morrissette bashings! and what actually sold the robin hood: prince of thieves soundtrack? why, bryan adams of course. i mean who cares if one of the  urlLink most important bands in the world  hates him.  anyway yah. this is most likely going to be your typical wannabe nyc blog. im sure i'll end up writing superfluous amounts of praise for  urlLink stellarstarr*  and  urlLink the stills , anger a few (re: wazillion) kids with my complete disdain for interpol, and all the while keeping the maple leaf/beavers/igloos/whatevs in mind by bringing you the latest news from canadian gems ala  urlLink destroyer ,  urlLink broken social scene ,  urlLink the sick lipstick , etc etc etc. who knows, maybe even the asian in me will whip out some hot  urlLink jay chow  gossip.   for now though, tim delaughter i love you. i dont care that you fronted for  urlLink tripping daisy . though i will admit 'i am an elastic firecracker' was on constant rotation when i first got it in like...1995? even so, puddle of mud ripped off your songs. i mean ewww. (GOD HELLO? 'she hates me' IS 'i got a girl'. EXACTLY). labels constantly drop your bands. when things are starting to look up, your band members OD and die. yet you come back with full on genius in the name of  urlLink the polyphonic spree ! unless you're not even alive im sure you've all heard of this band by now. but seriously CHECK THEM OUT IF YOU HAVENT. also, someone drive me to one of their double toronto shows on sept 29 or 30th!   urlLink whats worse than a terrorist? a child molesting terrorist   listening to:  urlLink the watchers  - two worlds

      oasis i still love you. it took me a while to 'get' heathen chemistry but i've realized hindu times is probably one of their best songs since slide away. plus liams got the same godamn jacket i do. this means jack shit but in case anyone questions my taste in leather, you can take it up with mr gallagher. he'll stick a champagne supernova up your bum.     memorable oasis quotes!  "If I saw an alien I'd tell it to fuck right off because whatever planet he came from they wouldn't have the Beatles or any decent fucking music. So they can fuck right off, I ain't going nowhere with them."  - liam  "It is hard to be modest at times like these so I won't even try...you are all shit!"  - noel   "I was staring in the mirror, and I saw god staring back at me" - liam   "It's a good thing we won, because we were going to thrash the place if we didn't." - liam after getting another award  "Being a lad is what I'm about. I can tell you who isn't a lad - anyone from Blur."  - liam on being a lad   Noel orders a beer, the rest opt for lemonades and Cokes. Above, the TV is on CNN News. "Have you seen some of the stories they have on here?" Noel enquires. "Check this one I saw this morning. There's this guy who's 75 and he's got cancer. So his doctor tells him he's got about two years to live. So he thinks, 'Fuck it, I've always hated my wife, the stupid bag.' So he kills her. 'What the fuck, I've got nothing to lose.' Then he's put in jail but, the problem is, he doesn't die. He's 99 now and guess what he's doing?" Noel surveys our expectant faces. "Suing the doctor," he cackles. "He's taking him to court," he continues, pissing himself. "And he's saying, ' If it wasn't for what you told me I would never have killed my wife and now you owe me ten million pounds.' I'm sitting there thinking, 'I know I live in a mad country but it's not half as crazy as it is here.'" - noel in america

      im sure most people are sick of hearing about pete and carl, jail, reunions and the shittiness of the  urlLink libertines  in general. make way for dublins'  urlLink THE THRILLS ! their bio is cocky as..well..a cock?:   Thrills who? You don't know about The Thrills? Here, in no particular order, are five remarkable things they've already done:  1. Played their debut London show at the Royal Albert Hall, after  a personal invitation from Morrissey.  2. Followed their muse to a beach in San Diego, where they sat on  a sofa for four months, writing songs.  3. Told their parents they had a record deal and were about to  become famous. For a year. When they didn't.  4. Chosen the coolest band name going  inspired in equal parts by  Phil Spector's Sixties girl groups and Michael Jackson's  greatest LP.  5. Sparked a record company scrum, designed the best band T-shirt  you'll see this year, been tipped the nod from everyone from  Noel Gallagher to Chris Martin.   thats some serious name dropping there. minus the fact they have the approval of the wrong gallagher brother and no one actually likes phil spector on account of him working with shitty  urlLink starsailor . oh and shooting people and puking all over the beatles.  either way you can tell they're going to be huge over here soon enough. being huge must rule? all the dudes in  urlLink the coral  are younger than me. but much huger! godamnit.  ps thanks ava!  listening to:  urlLink the wrens  - boys

      head over to  urlLink newyorkdoll.org  (extras section) for a couple of mp3s by  urlLink the killers  !!!! i've been searching on slsk forever for this noise..thank you giulia!  just a reminder that  urlLink the rapture  are on letterman TONIGHT. without the d.f.a, this band would've been NOBODY. seriously all their 'indie' songs on echoes are soooo horrible, but the 3 or so dance songs they have are fucking ON (thanks again to the d.f.a). djs play the shit out of house of jealous lovers and im still loving it. disco dance beats are where its at. eminem knew whats up ala without me!      urlLink the rapture cellphone ringtone. wtf.   according to my webstats, someone who ended up at this site searched for the following phrase:  "what the fuck is michael jackson s real hotmail tell me"  awesome. and thats my contribution to the ridiculous  urlLink mj news  quota as of late.

      according to  urlLink 'music experts' , these are the top ten of the best 1001 songs EVER  1. One - U2 2. I Say A Little Prayer - Aretha Franklin 3. Smells Like Teen Spirit - Nirvana 4. A Day In The Life - The Beatles 5. In The Ghetto - Elvis Presley 6. My Name Is - Eminem 7. Creep - Radiohead 8. Independent Women Part 1 - Destiny's Child 9. Live Forever - Oasis  10. River Deep Mountain High - Ike and Tina Turner  liam and noel definitely said ONE was the best song EVER when they were on tour with U2. how could you not trust the mono-browed duo? fuckin' mad for itttt! also note #9. i am SO on top of things. oasis forever.  word on the street says bernard butler is going to produce the second  urlLink libertines  album. hey remember that solo junk bernard tossed around for a while? and how mick jones of the clash helped the libertines the first time around and yet the debut lp still managed to suck wholeheartedly? yeeeeeeeeeeep.

         the new  urlLink liars  album (they were wrong so we drowned) has been leaked for a few days now. someone please tell me this is some decoy download or something? every track on here sounds incredibly revolting? liars used to be so fun and...good? whoah another question mark? gone are the plump bass lines and art punk disco beats all to be replaced by minimalism without tact. they threw us all in a trash can and stuck a monkeys ass on top.

         for those of you who've absolutely no idea whats going on ever, the strokes have been appearing weekly every tuesday this month on conan. im assuming they're going to finish off with 12:51 but where was THIS END HAS NO END? gaaaah. in case you missed them you can download each performance here (whatever happened/reptilia/under control):   urlLink thestrokesfan.com   yah so i dont really see why anyone would bother reading this blog. i talk about/bash all these nyc bands despite the fact that i dont even live in the same country! there are plenty others much more firsthand and informative than my sporadic babbling but whatevs i guess. i think im going to have to find some HOOK or 'thing' that i and only i do and write about. suggestions would be awesome. t'was my birthday last week and im too old to come up with anything fresh anymore. also complete and utter laziness ad infinitum. until then, boring nyc-wannabe blog it is! eat it.  ps thanks giulia/ urlLink new york doll  for the sweet mention!  listening to: talking heads - mr jones

      whenever i cant find something new to like, i cycle through some of the phases of my past musical lexicon. there would be weeks on end when i'd only listen to 90's britpop ala shed seven, kula shaker, rialto etc etc. seven of the twenty eight or so days would've been solely dedicated to going through  urlLink jarvis cockers discography . on a sidenote: i reckon the only fools to have picked up pulps greatest hits disc were also the ones who went out and bought nirvana's best of. seriously if you dont already own nevermind and friends then you really need to work on not being a sack of dumbass.   my early high school days were basically all about elastica, the rentals, and of course nirvana. throw in weezer to further ruin any credibility. track back further and you have me listening to bel biv devoe and brian adams in grade 4-5. everyone is a big fat liar if they tell you they never listened to new kids on the block.   moving out of my parents house involved lots of mogwai, refused, tristeza and blonde redhead. i remember my electronic/dnb phase immediately following watching the movie groove. sprinkle on some chinese/j-pop/early 90's emo bands/the cure and you have the basic map of steve lams jingles. flash forward to now and if you're reading this, im probably listening to whatever hip/pretentious/cool bands you're listening to.   i've no idea why i bothered to articulate all of the above. i actually did find new albums to dig:   urlLink clearlake - cedars    urlLink the coral - magic & medicine    urlLink devics - stars at st. andrea.  this came out a while ago but i dont think it received the attention it should have. clearly mentioning it on here will make up for it! portishead'ish if you didnt know.  miscellaneous blabbery:  urlLink the watchers  just finished up their tour with  urlLink james chance ! RIDICULOUS. this definitely makes them hotter than the  urlLink liars  right now.   im not sure how i feel about jarvis cockers  urlLink relaxed muscle  project yet. if noel gallagher says attempts at avant garde'ness are needless, then THEY ARE NEEDLESS. either way, we need the sexy jc back, not the idiotic deranged misfits costume bullshit.

         i remember trudging through the early morning and dirty ass downtown snow sludge to the bus stop after an evening of drunken debauchery. my friend evan was waiting for the 95 baseline too. this was back a year and a half ago when i still lived in the west end of ottawa. he was wearing a von bondies tuque. now, sometimes i like to exhibit false excitement if something incredibly dull comes up in conversation and yet a reaction is expected, but in this case, in full, genuine and intoxicated state, i blabber on THE VON BONDIES RULEE THE SCHOOOOL! evan mirrored my excitement and asked me if i had just seen them play a couple months prior at the same place i was getting my drink on that evening. I SAID NO. RIDICULOUS. HOW DID THIS COME ABOUT WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. i felt stubbornly suicidal and if not that, at least mild depression was in the mail thats for sure. meanwhile my other pal nick was all WHO THE FUCK ARE THE VON BONDIES?  well if you didnt know who they were, dont worry cause their new album is going to take over the entire world.   check out their new single/video "c'mon c'mon":  urlLink low   urlLink high   i cant get the high bandwidth link to stream video for some reason? it plays the audio though, which is still awesome.   everyone saw kraftwerk on the mtv europe awards? zzzzzzz. classic yes? still exciting? no.

      5 things you should listen to:  1)  sweet live audio recording of  urlLink the unicorns  set when they played at a vancouver carwash. they are not nice.  urlLink realaudio   2) royal city's cover of 'is this it'. its cute and folksy!  urlLink mp3   3) ny's  urlLink asobi seksu . think poppy blonde redhead + mogwai?  urlLink mp3   4) portland's  urlLink menomena .  usually not so but this song sounds very interpol'ish for you people with taste borderlining on insanity. ok shoot me i like interpol now.  urlLink mp3 . ps.  urlLink finally   5) another portland gem: kyle field aka  urlLink little wings .  urlLink mp3

         i just hurriedly scuddled home from the  urlLink broken social scene  /  urlLink metric  /  urlLink stars  show tonight. living in this city together with my dumbass taste in music, this was probably the third or fourth show i've gone to all year?   my sleeping patterns lately have been completely fucked, leaving me to wake up today at approximately 4:48 in such a light-headed daze i couldnt even tell if it was in the a.m or p.m. it ended up being the latter and so i completely missed  urlLink stars ' set. gahh. im sure they had fit into the set effortlessly as for those unaware, this montreal band (though originally from the nyc/williamsburg area but moved away from that scene. they roomed with one of the yeah yeah yeah's before the yeah yeah yeahs came into existence. uh wowwwww) is a fine mix between broken social scenes quieter moments and metric/emily haine's vocals. it might also have had something to do with the fact that every band tonight shared at least two members from the other bands that played.   the show was at a new venue in town that i've never been to before. somehow the place churned out the worst crowd i've ever seen in this city? jocks were ridiculously abundant, spewing out heckles you'd hear at a staind concert.  jesus christ they could have at least stuck with the 'less talk more rock' line? whatevssss. i overheard a group discussing how they were going to "fuck shit up and mosh". thankfully no one actually 'threw down', but apparently thats exactly what happened at the last hot hot heat show a few days prior? its time like that when this beautiful city is just a huge embarassment. i've no idea whats wrong with this place? its definitely not a canadian thing when toronto and montreal are churning out amazing bands lately while ottawa is just stuck as a frat rock haven. im off to nyc soon enough. WAIT FOR IT.   anyway back to the show. i had just arrived in time to catch metric as they opened with what i guess you could consider their single, 'IOU'. the lovely emily haines (imagine  urlLink weeping tiles ' sarah harmer crossed with uma thurman) danced and strutted around the stage as if she had no idea she was in a mini-skirt. the first half of their set was kinda weak, but it all turned around half way in as they finally closed with 'dead disco'. definitely one of their better songs but i was just glad they played 'the list' !   next, broken social scene came onto stage triumphantly with glass tiger as their entrance music! how glorious. the band was charming as their music was absolutely captivating. i've been spinning 'you forgot it in people' for over a year and a half now with prospects of seeing them forever so you can imagine the hype i demanded of them as a live band. everything they played, from 'kc accidental' to 'cause=time' to one of the best songs to come out in a while 'anthems for a seventeen year old girl'(featuring emily haines on vocals ahh!), came out so flawlessly and with such power i nearly lost it for every song. the only problem i had with their set was the fact that they played for almost 2 hours and and i was ready to keel at any time. the latter portion of their set was filled with a bunch of not-so-wonderful cover songs and was hindering the roll they were on. oh well...i still stick to my rule that no band really needs to play more than fourty seven minutes live. and thats a calculated fact. uhhh kinda. ok not really. but yah i'd seriously almost lost my faith in live music until tonight. they finally ended off with 'im still your fag'.    and with that, this 'fag' is off!

LLeH N nruB!!!   videos released over the past month or so:  urlLink stellastarr* - my coco  - featuring  urlLink sarah  &  urlLink giulia !    urlLink liars - theres always room on the broom  - i dont know why im even talking about this revamped avant-blah band anymore.  theres been some talk in all the right circles about  urlLink the information  lately. regardless, from what i've heard im throwing them into the crap pile with  urlLink tv on the radio . who knows..maybe i'll start liking them in a year or something? god knows it took me forever to eat up  urlLink interpol .   urlLink FUCK THE RIAA. -pepsi

         for you art-rock enthusiasts watch out for a new  urlLink deerhoof  lp entitled  milk man  on mar 9! a lot of fresh ears were won over by last years apple'o and i imagine even bigger and better things this time around. you can almost download apple'o in its entirety as well as some sweet ass live tracks ->  urlLink here . BUN DA BUM DA BUN DA BUM CHINA!  the same date will see the release of a debut album by  urlLink tv on the radio  on  urlLink touch & go . meh. im generally all for overhyped bands (the darkness recently won me over with 'get your hands off my woman' with its lets-be-grunge-for-three-minutes rock) but theres just something about tv on the radio that irks me...   urlLink coachella line up confirmations and rumours!  yah yah blah blah the pixies are playing it blah blah. more importantly,  urlLink LCD soundsystem  is on the bill! they play shows? WHAT

       urlLink francesco scavullo , legendary fashion photographer who'd worked with the likes of madonna, duran duran, as well as the first to shoot a black model for the cover of vogue (beverly johnson, in 1974), died at the age of 82 in new york on thursday jan 6. scavullo's nude work with burt reynolds ( urlLink smokey and the bandit star sprawled out on a bearskin carpet ) became the first male centerfold.   while julian casablancas is haughtily giving corporate KROQ executives the finger,  urlLink hip-hop gets down and sucks the corporate proverbial peen . not the best antithetical example with the strokes there but you know what i mean.  and finally,  urlLink oasis  drummer alan white apparently left the greatest uk rock and roll band in the world due to  urlLink tendonitis ? nooooooooo

        img:jasper coolidge  poor daddy. the latter half of the  urlLink mommy and daddy  duo wanted to be jack white for a day (and i dont mean he wanted to be a 'little girl', as  urlLink ryan adams  would refer to the ever so violent, fake-sister lauding hooligan!) by slicing up a tendon in his hand. they'll be out of commission for a few months. heres  urlLink mommy's  detailed account of the whole affair involving tales of smelly chinese women and other horrors only a ghetto ass hospital could ever reveal. whats up with daddy looking like hes blurting straightedge lyrics in an 80s hardcore band? thats awesome. kinda. not really.

      i know as soon as i post this im going to want to revise the hell out of it...but ok here goes:   top ten songs of 2003   10.   urlLink the cardigans  - couldn't care less  this song lulls me into the same shitty ass mood as when i initially heard it when it came out in the 1st quarter of 2003.  09.   urlLink the killers  - on top  'indie rock and roll' might have taken this tracks place if not for the cheesy lyrics about thrift store nonsense or something or other.   08.   urlLink moving units  - between us and them  2003 was definitely the year of the disco beat. everyone should have known this when eminem hit us with 'without me'. the moving units nailed that shit down with this track.   07.   urlLink sufjan stevens  - they also mourn who do not wear black (for the homeless in muskegon)  the melody of the vocals definitely reminds me of the late elliott smith. if this track were a christmas song it'd be 'carol of the bells', which by the way is the only acceptable holiday jingle ever. you'll know what i mean if you take a listen.   06.   urlLink outkast/andre 3000  - spread  if you can figure out a way to not have 'hey ya' on repeat, skip back a few tracks and give this gem a chance. my favourite part of the whole 2 disc mess is the sweet ass ending of 'happy valentines day' fading away and then 'spread' just starts slapping the crap out of you.   05.   urlLink !!!  - me and giuliani down by the schoolyard  you have absolutely no idea where those sweet ass nine minutes had gone 'cause you were too busy trying to get your seizure-induced legs to quit.   04.   urlLink stellastarr*  - in the walls  most ppl who know whats up have heard this song by now. you love it i love it everyone loves it blah blah.  03.   urlLink deerhoof  - panda panda panda  while 'dummy discards a heart' would certainly take a spot on a 'top best openers on an album' list, this song makes you think the band is nothing but a recording of a little lolita absentmindedly twirling on her toes, knees, and other random pivotal body parts in her bedroom until you actually decide to listen and realize you've just been graced with a legitimate and polished scheme of sound.  02.   urlLink interpol  - length of love  ok. i'll admit that i used to bash this band more than most ppl want to bash george w's nuts, but im over that ewww-superoverhyped-band-must-avoid-at-all-costs phase and now i seriously cant get enough of 'turn on the bright lights'. i know this particular track hasnt actually been recorded yet but live versions are floating around soulseek and i owe it to this band for sticking around despite my initial supreme destructive hatred. yeaaaah  01.   urlLink the strokes  - i cant win  the strokes. you know how they do. i never cease to smile when it hits back into the main guitar riff at exactly 1:57 minutes  into the song.   some obvious givens and runner-ups i should mention just for the hell of it : outkast-hey ya / the rapture - house of jealous lovers (yes yes it came out in 2002 blah blah) / junior senior - any song off the disc really / doves - words / client - here and now / lcd soundsystem - give it up / stars - what the snowman learned about / von bondies - c'mon c'mon / the shins - kissing the lipless / clearlake - almost the same / menomena - e. is stable / the strokes - the end has no end / goldfrapp - crystalline green / moving units - unpersuaded / the cinema eye - what you die for / no doubt - its my life cover (ugh its so good!) / fuck me usa! - infinite slope / the unicorns - inoculate the innocuous / knife skills - track 2 i dont know the song name ahh! but that no wave noise bastard in me loves it / dandy warhols - you were the last high / the thrills - don't steal our sun / metric - dead disco / grandaddy - now its on / radio 4 - certain tragedy /

         nice PHOTOSHOP LENS FLARE?! respect for  urlLink moving units  plummetting.   march 9th is going to be an AWESOME DAY. alongside  urlLink deerhoofs  new lp ( milk man ),  urlLink blonde redhead  recently signed to  urlLink 4ad  alongside total pothead neil halstead and have a new album entitled  misery is a butterfly . the site reads a release date of feb 23rd BUT I KNOW IM RIGHT ON THIS ONE. MARCH 9TH DAMNIT.   tracklist:  01 Elephant Woman 02 Messenger 03 Melody 04 Doll Is Mine 05 Misery Is A Butterfly 06 Falling Man 07 Anticipation 08 Maddening Cloud 09 Magic Mountain 10 Pink Love 11 Equus  if you havent heard already,  urlLink ladytron  is going to be remixing interpols  untitled . i've no idea when this is supposed to be out and im sure it wont be too good anyway.  this is largely based on arthur bakers remix of obstacle 1 which is just a series of awful cut and pasting  in cool edit or something. SUCK! at least interpol made  blue jeans  way better.  anyway due to my SCRATCHED CORNEA, my ability to update this site has been largely hindered, mostly due to any  BOLD FONTS  that definitely cause severe pain upon viewing. no. joke.

      3 reasons the new courtney love album(feb 10) will RULE  1) lots of hair is cool now. this means billy corgan will be out of commission whilst growing his mop circa gish and in doing so, will be TOO BUSY TO FUCK UP THIS ALBUM 2) all the pre-adolescents will confuse her with brody dalle and buy this album to snub crybaby tim armstrong 3)  urlLink JUST CHECK OUT THESE PREVIEW TRACKS OK   AND WATCH THE  urlLink VIDEO FOR MONO

       urlLink new pornographers ' carl newman is coming out with a solo project on  urlLink matador records . its just some nice catchy indiepop. i love the slight lisp in his voice.  urlLink download here   bands to check out: fans of  urlLink my bloody valentine  definitely head over to  urlLink pluramon . the  dreams top rock  album seriously rivals  loveless .   i've been obsessed with finding quiet, lulling tunes as of late. the only criteria being they still must be ENGAGING. my playlist has just been riddled with  urlLink stina nordenstam ,  urlLink devics , and  urlLink the innocence mission .   pitchfork has been on the ball lately as they've finally slapped on  urlLink hot reviews  of comatose keyboard rockers  urlLink on! air! library!  and they're definitely all over  urlLink ratatat  as most die-hard  urlLink interpol  fans have heard of already.  HERES MY SLEEP PLAYLIST AS OF A FEW NIGHTS AGO:  > doves _ m62 song > sondre lerche _ it's over > mice parade _ two, three, fall > ellen allien _ abstract pictures > little wings _ i saw reflections > parsley sound _ yoyo > air _ alone in kyoto > innocence mission _ tomorrow on the runway > figurine _ time (his mix) > broadcast _ winter now > the delgados _ coming in from the cold > pluramon _ noise academy > jesus & mary chain _ just like honey > the arcade fire _ my heart is an apple > elbow _ grace under pressure > asobi seksu _ walk on the moon > broken social scene _ anthem for a seventeen year old girl > devics _ the end and the beginning > on! air! library! _ five > my bloody valentine _ loomer > stina nordenstam _ stations  and the final alarm clock snooz'ish song: > +/- _ no one sees you like i do  this track is going to make wake me up, let me fall back asleep for three seconds, wake my fat ass up again, lull me back to sleep for another three seconds, and repeat.

      so i guess all the hype finally paid off.  urlLink franz ferdinand  definitely just signed with  urlLink EPIC  sealing a deal apparently worth 1.5 million dollars! fucking insane. the last thing i sealed was a piece of my cat's shit in a coffee cup cause i was too lazy to properly clean it up. that story alone is worth a million bucks godamnit.  swedens  urlLink mando diao  are making the rounds and are slowly gaining recognition amongst who i would consider respectable circles i suppose.  urlLink giulia  describes them as some sickening crossbreed of the  urlLink hives  and  urlLink caesars palace .  ok they're actually just CAESARS now or whatever but i just find it weird calling them that? i've listened to the mando diao album a few times and i definitely think caesars is much better off but what do i know? it took me forever to love  urlLink interpol .  if you're into bands like  urlLink the jam  and  urlLink the clash , go check out  urlLink the ordinary boys . i think one of the dudes used to be in some hardcore band or something cause hes got the worst tattoos ever.

       urlLink jack white pleading guilty to charges of beating up von bondies' jason stollsteimer    ``This was a personal matter and not a press promotion,'' White said after the hearing, reading from a handwritten note tucked in his fedora. ``I regret allowing myself to be provoked to the point of getting into a fistfight but I was raised to believe that honor and integrity mean something and that those principles are worth defending.''   that is seriously the funniest shit ever.

      im back! problems with bandwidth overload quelled once again. im the supreme master of the internet.  the following recent releases and soon-to-be's are awesome:   urlLink von bondies  - pawn shoppe heart  urlLink blonde redhead  - misery is a butterfly  urlLink the killers  - lp   urlLink REM  are set to release their 13th full length soon enough! the sound is being described as "very, very quiet or very, very loud". arent they like chris carabba or ryan adams favourite band or something? either way they're both still giant losers.   i dunno what to think of dave grohls  urlLink probot  project. i didnt think there'd be any way to discredit grohl but things just dont seem as impenetrable anymore. he'll be ok as soon as he continues to make more fun of clay aiken and  urlLink the vines .    urlLink HEY!!!!

      i cant shut up about marcus schmickler aka  urlLink pluramon . all i can think about when listening to  dreams top rock  (his other albums are all over the place in terms of genre ranging from IDM (yah yah thats like saying "emo" whatevs blahbablh) and electronica) is MY BLOODY VALENTINE!!! if  loveless  was responsible for inspiring a wazillion shoddy shoegaze bands (the more i listen to  urlLink my vitriol  the more grossed out i get? i dont know i used to love them!) then it should also be noted that at least one sweet follow-up (AKA THE ALBUM IM TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW) came out in the aftermath.     julie cruises vocals (aka the roadhouse singer from TWIN PEAKS) remind me of a cleaned up  urlLink stina nordenstam , and although not nearly as eery and threatening as belinda butcher, her vocals are just so PERFECT. meanwhile pluramon has the whole kevin shields guitar sound down pat. i am writing like a giddy schoolgirl right now.   DOWNLOAD THIS PLURAMON TRACK NOW. its totally mbv's "touch my breath" & "loomer" combined.   urlLink pluramon - hello shadow

       urlLink the unicorns  show was alright. they opened with their best song (tuff ghost) and ended off with their weakest (i was born a unicorn) but whatevs. i asked them if they had read through the  urlLink uniporn  yet and they seemed to get really upset. their anger seemed further exacerbated when they sent FUCKING CAPTAIN INSANO (the 'silent' member of the unicorns? HE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO KILL EVERYONE and punched mercilessly in random directions!) and their roadie who looked like a french norm mcdonald to our post-show pizza party. i only had two slices. thanks layla for entertaining us while i had to wait for the morning bus to come around.  check out the remix of interpol's untitled done by  urlLink velapene screen . its good and you dont have to pay for it. arthur baker sucks!   urlLink interpol - untitled (interpool swimwear remix)   speaking of  urlLink interpol  i've come across a worthwhile band who semi-remind me of them? a band from eastpoint, georgia of all places called  urlLink snowden . you can download the ep almost in its entirety from the site but get this track first:   urlLink snowden - kill the power  and then this one:  urlLink snowden - victim card   snowden? I'D RATHER BE SNOWED IN. thats what i'd say if i hated this band. but i dont. they are my new lovers.

      JUST GOT BACK FROM MACROCK WEEKEND. despite the four million bands playing i think i only bothered to watch two or three? there was a point in the evening where i thought i was just going to give up watching live bands altogether until  urlLink plus/minus  and  urlLink mates of state  got on stage. both were phenomenal. can you believe the two members of mates of state are married and preggers AND still touring? its like  urlLink julie doiron  but waaaay cooler and less french.   lots of hang outs with some awesome kids sewn throughout the plethora of post-macrock afterparties! my new best friend forevs DANA and i were discussing nyc bands and i was reminded of  urlLink prosaics !!! i remember checking out their page a while ago listening to their short ass sound clips of joy division/new order'esque  urlLink failure  and instantly fell in love. its seriously ian curtis reincarnated. heres a full track of TEETH even though i dont think its their best track...NONETHELESS CLICK CLICK HERE ->  urlLink prosaics - teeth   i think im off to see the  urlLink JEWKNEECORNS  tonight. though im tired and may just stay in to celebrate/jack off to UNICORNS  urlLink UNI-PORN .

      firstly, new blogger layout. all comments seem to have vanished, but  urlLink giulia  you're welcome for the  urlLink film school mp3s ! everyone check them out and let me know what you think?  how the hell did i not know about the  urlLink two streaming killers videos  on their site?   urlLink hot fuss   may or may not be the only record i actually buy this year.   other records to look forward to this fall:  -debut lp from canadian assholes  urlLink death from above . its so weird seeing them mentioned in blogs alongside bigger american bands now. i remember touring with them to places like buttfuck oakville ontario playing in community center gymnasiums. now they're headlining  urlLink vice parties  in australia and touring with  urlLink the fever . awesome. download an  urlLink mp3  of this two piece bass & drum fuckfeast if you somehow havent heard of them yet.  -new  urlLink interpol!  "In addition to "NARC" and "Length of Love," songs that have been recorded and are being considered for the new album include "Not Even Jail," "Evil" and one that has the working title "Rod Laver." some geezer tennis player i dunno. is it me or did paul banks gain a few pounds?    if you're somewhat savvy with film you should enter the  urlLink interpol short film contest . i would except the only video i ever tried to put together was a movie about cyborg ninjas and our costumes included nintendo power gloves with the wires cut off. so um yah.   ALSO GO WATCH  urlLink THE ASOBI SEKSU VIDEO!!! . just scroll down a bit. sondre lerches two way monologue is on there as well but i cant stand watching him cause he looks too much like  urlLink clay aiken ? anyway the video is awesome cause it has a couch for the centerpiece and interpol sings about couches so woohoo.   urlLink franz ferdinand , alongside  urlLink the dandy warhols  and  urlLink super furry animals  are featured on a soundtrack for a  urlLink PORNO FLICK !  nine songs  directed by michael winterbottom premiered at the cannes film festival a few weeks ago. its supposed to be a love story told through the act of blowjobs and vagina licking and cumshots and etc etc. yes im sure when it comes to video everyones going to be renting it for its sentimental value and totally NOT  pulling their goalie  to it.

      I AM BACK SORTA! chillin' at my parents place for a bit. i've not much time to update this but i guess  urlLink the killers  management checked out my blog and emailed me to tell me about a band from san franscisco called  urlLink film school .   lo' and behold they definitely fit into the spacey shoegaze nonsense i've been listening to as of late.  urlLink film school  sound like a better  urlLink my vitriol  but with more 'indie' vocals if that makes sense. i still cant tell if i like them yet or not though.  who am i kidding im horrible at describing music. and i only like interpol.  anyway check out their demo  urlLink http://www.filmschoolmusic.com/demo   notable tracks  "11-11" for its quirkiness "harmed" "like you know"

      a few weeks ago i was kicking it in brooklyn and now i am in IOWA of all places. i finally bought a copy of  urlLink the killers  album right before partying it up in las vegas! oooooh. oh las vegas. fifteen minutes of pure awe followed by complete and utter confusion as to why such a place even exists. i get to see my favourite person ever in two days in chicago. nyc ppl i'll be partying it up july 3rd and 4th @  urlLink misshapes  or whatever the hell i get dragged into. anyway a bunch of norwegians are trying to usurp this computer from me. whats a dainty little asian to do against godamn vikings?

      COMPLETELY UNRELATED NON MUSIC POST.   i think when most ppl go to nyc and know whats up they try to hit up all the hot spots before they get old and shitty. i should have gone to  urlLink misshapes  or something completely 'buzz' like that but NOPE. AS FOR ME, i just spent a whole day in manhattan trying to find a fitting pair of  urlLink levi's 518 junior womens jeans  with no luck whatsoever. i am awesome. seriously though is there no actual conversion from mens to womens sizes? ppl who work in clothing stores are worst than radio shack employees. THEY DONT KNOW ANYTHING EVER. i have a 30" waist. all i know is that size 11 in girly girl size is much too big for me. HELP ME OUT HERE!  anyway i'll be gone for a few more weeks. im stuck in dirty new jersey right now but i'll be all the way over in california in the next little while. please dont ask me why. im trying to think of any tidbits of blubbery i can drop here. we all know that  urlLink daft punk are remixing franz ferdinands' take me out . well guess what? they're also doing a  urlLink death from above  tune. i dont know which yet but i guess it wouldn't really matter cause most of their songs sound the same. they're still awesome nonetheless.   you know who knows whats up?  urlLink giulia  knows whats up. we both say keep listening to  urlLink film school !  urlLink click

        as if there werent enough breasts sporadically bursting out lately. GODAMNIT   urlLink COURTNEY LOVE KILLS HER POSSIBLY FICTIONAL BABY    urlLink further proof that john mayer is the biggest loser in the world   nyc's  urlLink dfa records  have legally forced toronto's  urlLink death from above  to change their name. they're now known as FIRST TO FIGHT.   heres the word from the FIRST TO FIGHT boys:  quote: "hello due to legal issues we want nothing to do with we have had to change our name the people at DFA records apparently trademarked DEATH FROM ABOVE in america and so our label in america (vice/atlantic) wont release our record as long as they have taken legal action. we tried for the last 3 weeks to make this go away, we had the best lawyers working on it non stop, we tried everything. but now, rather than fooling around with this anymore we have had to change our name to FIRST TO FIGHT. we went through about 100000000 names and they all sucked in thier own special way.  so nothing will change on here for awhile cause im not at home and the all important logo is still the same. its a downer but it had to happen. a rose by any other name, right?  so in closing FUCK DFA RECORDS FUCK JAMES MURPHY WE DECLARE JIHAD ON THEM HOLY WAR ENDING IN THIER DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT  -j f k"  oh jesse. 'THIER THIER' it'll be ok.

      five weeks are up and i'm FINALLY HOME. expect regular updates once again blah blah blah.  CELEBRITY SIGHTINGS: i saw paris hilton in some random grocery store in burbank, california. tara reid walked by me on the streets of madison, wisconsin. orlando bloom and kirsten dunst sightings in louisville, kentucky where they're filming some movie about whatevs. WOWWWW. actually i didnt see the latter but they were in town SOMEWHERE.  its been so long since i've been home and i have no idea what the hell is going on ever now. the new  urlLink interpol  album  antics  is all over soulseek and etc already? in fact i'm listening to it for the first time right now and its pretty much the best thing ever. though one could discern that the past month and a half of only being able to listen to three cds in the van (pinkerton, dookie, and some crappy damien jurado album) has pretty much revirginized my ears and any new music thrusting about is welcome with gusto.   either way listen to a new track here (thanks random commenter!):   urlLink interpol - evil   call me crazy but all i can think about when i hear the opening bass line is NIRVANA.
