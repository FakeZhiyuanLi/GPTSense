       I heard a story on NPR while driving in to work this morning. It's Memorial Day. Congressional Cemetary is the final resting place for many veterans. One of the men buried there was obviously gay and there are usually flowers on his grave, especially during Gay Pride Week. His marker reads, "They gave me a medal for killing two men and a discharge for loving one."  If that doesn't sum up American values, I don't know what does.

       Since the death of my husband/best friend/soul mate I have been doing a lot of starting over.  My mother, aunt, and brother came to visit recently. They stayed for 4 days and when they left I felt the Big Empty. I didn't realize how lonely I have become, which is odd because I have always been a bit of a loner.  My husband Jay was my best friend. We met over the internet and instantly clicked. We were very much alike in many ways, very different in others. Jay was an extrovert, a real "people person". I am content to stand in a corner at a party and watch the ebb and flow of human interaction. Most of my life had been spent just like that, in a corner. I watched life rather than lived it. Jay changed that. We drove almost 4 hours to Chatsworth, Georgia to adopt a male schnauzer I found on the internet. We drove to High Point, North Carolina on a furniture buying trip. A spur of the moment jaunt one Saturday took us to Savannah, Georgia where we wandered the streets beneath the massive, draped oak trees. Found the Mercer house. Jay got us involved with Revolutionary War reenacting, beer brewing, web page design, and so many other activities. We had a little over 6 full years together. Then the cancer took him away from me.  I miss him. Thank God for photography. The many pictures I have of him pull my attention back to the happy times when I have trouble forming something other than an image of the dying Jay. I don't want to hold that image in my heart: the sallow man with paper skin, feeding tube in stomach and trach in his throat. It has been especially hard to overcome the final 10 minutes of his life. I held his hand as he died.  Life has become a struggle again. There is so little joy in my heart. Work is frustrating and unsatisfying. Sans Jay, I have reverted back to simply watching and reacting to life rather than living it. I wish the economy was better so I could get paid enough to make ends meet. As it is, I have to find a 2nd job. I know many Americans share that experience.

       Work continues to trudge along. I did get new software to learn (Adobe Illustrator) and that is nice. I like the challenge, I like to learn. Almost forgot about the mini-drama Saturday night. I was getting ice water from the fridge and glanced over to the right. On the floor, between several bottles of water and a twelve-pack of Diet Rite, was a dark form. I assumed it was a mouse as they are occasional visitors. That's the price one pays for living in the woods. I looked closer and found it was not a mouse, but a snake.  Great. When you live alone these problems become all yours. Dusty's interest had been aroused but I shooed him away. If it was poisonous, which I doubted, it's bite might prove fatal to a dog. It was obviously a baby snake, only 12 inches or so long. I figured at worst it could make me sick. I hunted around for something to capture it with and came back with a large Tupperware container. (One hundred and Two uses!) I got the snake into the container but then had to slide the lid under it. It wriggled out and there I was dancing around to keep my bare feet away from it. I admit to yelling a bad word too. Got it covered again, then retrieved a thick leather glove from the garage. I finally managed to get the lid on (mostly) and took it out front. I dropped it off the front porch, so I suppose I may see it again. My hope is for it to eat enough mice to become too big to fit through the same hole! After a little research on the internet I have come to believe it was a baby black rat snake. Makes sense since I have seen an adult around the yard in the past couple of years. I'm thankful that I have no fears of critters. I don't know who I would have called for help.

       June 21, 2004. One year ago today we decided to give Jay a bath. I wheeled him back to the bathroom and got him in the tub. Before we were finished he began to have trouble breathing. The tumors had crushed his esophagus so he had a peg (feeding tube). We didn't know the tumors were beginning to crush his trachea as well. "Get me back to bed," he gasped, and we raced down the hall. I helped this wet, naked man get into the hospital bed then watched helplessly as my husband/best friend/soul mate struggled to breathe. He grabbed handfuls of sheet. His body went from red to white, his face turned blue. All I could do was call 9-1-1. The right side of his face turned darker blue. His eyes were red and wide with panic. "I'm dying, baby," he whispered and we both believed it. I tried to get some Ativan into him but don't know how much actually made it down the tube. Jay was trying to use the spirometer, the plastic device they give you after surgery to keep your lungs functioning. He blew into that for a bit, pushed it aside, then picked it up again. He lay on his side, back to me, working and concentrating on breathing. I put my hand on him and waited. All I could do was wait and let him know I was right there with him. I have never felt so helpless in my life. After 45 minutes he was able to regain control of his breathing. I called 9-1-1 and they were still trying to figure out where we were. I told them to forget it. Jay told me later, "I think the only reason I didn't die was I prayed, 'Please God don't let me die on our anniversary.'" It was our sixth and the only one I remember clearly.

       I can't believe it's June already. This is going to be a long, hot summer.  I was awake before the alarm went off at 5:30 a.m. as usual. As I headed for the bathroom I looked back at G (my miniature schnauzer Gretchen). She had her little head propped on the edge of her dog bed, staring up at me. It was too early for her. She doesn't do mornings. She had what Jay used to call "bed beard". One side was mashed flat while the other stuck straight out like Salvador Dali's mustache. The two boys were already running up and down the hall. They wanted their kibble! I wish I could wake up like Dusty does. He is always in a good mood, fiesty and ready for the day. Of course, he has someone to take care of him and can nap whenever he wants.   He makes me laugh. He spends all day in the yard. Even in the summer, this black schnauzer "patrols" his yard, baking (and barking) in the heat. He finally comes in, gets a drink of water, and throws himself on the tile floor. He lays there and pants like a locomotive for about 5 minutes, then jumps up and heads back out again. It's a tough job. What a trooper.  Everyone at work is sluggish today. Willy thinks it is the heat. He's probably right. That in tandem with not having much to do at the moment. We can't stop yawning.  This is going to be a long, hot summer.

       I picked up Jay's ashes yesterday. They are actually called "cremains". Isn't that an odd word? It sounds like a word that a child would make up. I was not looking forward to the chore but it actually provided a degree of closure for me that I had not expected.   Jay plays songs for me on the radio. I know that sounds stupid but I believe it is his way of letting me know he is there with me. His mom smells his pipe tobacco although no one smokes in her house. His daughter sees rainbows.  The special song, the one that makes me feel that he is right there with me, is Van Morrison's 'Brown Eyed Girl'. Guess what came on the radio just as I entered the MCG complex? I felt a whole lot better. It was still hard, but he made it easier for me.  They are in a cardboard box, about 8 inches long, 6 inches wide and 5 inches deep. Inside the cardboard box is a black plastic box. I'm not sure how it opens. I didn't want to try it. I could see myself flinging ashes all over the kitchen. There is something hilarious and morbid at the same time in that. So the black plastic box will remain in place until time to bury them with the Japanese Maple in the back yard. His mom and brother want to come up for that. It will provide some closure for them as well.

       Heard on NPR today that CEO salaries saw a 15% increase last year. Average salary was $1.8 million. I guess that's the reward for sending so many American jobs overseas. I got a 3% raise and we were lucky to get that.  Well, Jay died 11 months ago today. One of my chores for today is to call MCG to make arrangements to get his ashes back. If I get to keep my house my plans are to buy a nice Japanese maple for the back yard. Jay and I had always planned on doing that. I will bury his ashes with the tree.

       I left work at the normal time yesterday, 4:30. Got onto I-20 at mile marker 64 and traffic slowed almost immediately. Two hours and six miles later I found out why. From The State newspaper here in Columbia:  "Four people died and at least 55 were hurt Monday afternoon in five collisions in Lexington County, the state Highway Patrol said. The most dramatic collision occurred about 2:30 p.m. at I-20 and U.S. 1, where an Athens, Ga.-bound charter bus returning from a family reunion in Myrtle Beach sandwiched a Ford Focus between the bus and a tractor-trailer rig, patrol spokesmen said. Early indications were the bus driver was distracted and drove into the subcompact with enough force to push it fully under the 18-wheeler, said patrol spokesman Sid Gaulden. The Ford also caught fire."  It was bad to be stuck in traffic for two hours but at least I got home safe and sound.

       So the Democratic National Convention starts tonight in Boston. Am I going to watch? Heck no. I don't need a pep rally. Already know who I'm voting for. Or more precisely, who I'm voting against.   I'm reading a good book right now, called Crude Politics by Paul Sperry. Very enligtening. I had long suspected but certainly now believe we went to war for oil. Everything the Bush administration has done centers on the oil and gas pipelines that corporate interests want to build from the Caspian Sea down into India. Those pipelines would run through Afghanistan and Pakistan. Which explains why we are buddies with the birthplace of the Taliban. Pakistan shelters Taliban and Al-Queda. Their madrassas teach the fundamentalist Islam that is central to the jihad against us. It is a backward country run by a brutal dictator... but they can help our corporations so that makes them okay. The  best part is the oil would go to Asian markets. We need to be certain that the people who took our jobs have the energy to continue their work.  The Bush regime is so incredibly corrupt. It floors me how anyone could think he is a good president.   "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention."

       Drywall work continues in the house. The site of the new office has been mudded and sanded once. It looks like it snowed in the room. I'll be so glad when it is ready to paint. I'm going to paint the walls the same sage green that is in the dining room and turn the office into a kind of tropical/Ernest Hemingway kind of look. The big antique desk that Dad gave me will work great in there. We will also put the treadmill in there, so all three of us can use it.  I say all three of us because every time I talk to Mom we speak as if their moving here is a done deal. She is talking of putting her house on the market in September. She discovered realtor's fees are a little more than she thought. I was thinking that is actually good news in my case: it makes the trustee even less likely to take my house from me. It would not yield any profit at all for them. Now, if he will just let me keep my car. All he has to do is walk out and look at it to see that it is not even worth the Blue Book price. It needs new tires and now a new windshield. A six inch crack has become a 10 inch crack. I just hope it holds until after August 6. I'm not putting any money into the car until I find out if I get to keep it.  It seems like I spend most of my life waiting to find out how someone else will affect my life. I wish I could learn to live life right now instead of always waiting for some future outcome. I keep thinking, "life will be better when..." Don't I know tomorrow never comes?  Anyway, back to the home demolition. I'm removing the chair rail from my bedroom. Mario told me a secret: score the top and bottom of the rail with a utility knife first. That prevents the rail from tearing off portions of the drywall when it is pulled away. So far, it has worked like a charm!

       Talked to my aunt Aletha last night. The topic of Jay's cremains came up and I was telling her how surprised I was at the weight of the box. It was heavier than I expected. She asked how much it weighed and I said I thought 8 or 10 pounds. Out of curiosity I placed it on the digital scale but it wasn't heavy enough to register. Okay, the box was lighter than I thought. Aletha said, "Oh, so you mean we won't always weigh this much?" (Aletha, like me, is a "big girl"). I replied, "See, I KNEW most of this weight was water!" We both got a good laugh out of it. Some may find it morbid but I think it's a good sign we can still find humor in the midst of such sadness. That capacity is probably the essence of hope.   She told me of a friend whose wife died years ago. He can tell you exactly how many days have passed since she died. Now THAT is sad.  I really didn't want to come in to work this morning. I never seem to feel rested. Ever. This weekend was nice, though. The weather on both days was great and we broke a record low on Sunday morning. When I mowed the front and back yards Saturday morning it was 60 when I started and 64 when I finished. My kind of weather! Sunday morning was so peaceful. I sat with windows open, French door open to the back deck, and enjoyed my coffee, the birds, the occasional song of the wind chimes that Aletha sent me. Even the dogs seemed mellowed out. Oh, Dusty did bound across the yard to menace something, but by and large it was a tranquil morning. I hope this week... what, is not terrible? I guess. I'll be glad when some things change.
