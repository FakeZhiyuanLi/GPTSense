      Saturday (International Women's Pain Day). Janice's dad collapses.  Me and my friend Janice were just lying around her place wondering what to do and chatting. We chat alot, honestly, I don't know two people who chat more, except for my friends Danny and Craig, but they're joined at the hip so they have to talk a lot, just to manouvre around and stuff. So, me and Janice were chatting, mainly about her dad, who's so fat he's been told by the doctor that he's not to stand up in case his legs break, I know, it's really bad, but it's true, so anyways, we was chatting and I said:   "Janice, something really weird's happening to your dad"   and she was like   "What?"   and I just pointed, because I couldn't believe my eyes and I was worried that if I said anything I'd vomit.  Janice's dad was just collapsing in on himself, it was disgusting, but kind of interesting too.  His face just started to sink into his chin and before you could say 'Gypsum salts' he was just a man and a neck on a chair. He didn't even say anything, or if he did it was lost in the mounds of flesh, muffled by his excessive bulk. Janice just looked and then started to make a high-pitched sound like this 'Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeow',    and we both just sat there and watched. Soon, her dad had completely disappeared and all that was left was a tiny envelope (like the one's you get birthday cards in), it was pink and made of flesh, but it was an envelope all the same. At first we were both shocked   and neither of us made a sound, then Janice just started to laugh. She's got a lovely laugh and she never takes anything too seriously so I was glad to see that I wouldn't have to console her or anything (I'm not very good at consolation, I think that if you're not a winner, you're just depressing, so get over it!). Anyway, once the laughter had died down and I'd done a little dance to cheer her up (I'm really good at dances) we started thinking about all the possibilities that this occurence had opened up. It was a wide vista of options and it began with the drinks cabinet.  Janice never had a mom. Apparently her dad had slipped up in a night-club in the early 80s and the next thing he knew this woman appeared on his doorstep with a baby. She said it was his. At first he couldn't believe it because he had literally just slipped up in this nightclub, trying to dance to 'Don't You Want Me', he hit a spot of babycham on the floor and bumped into this woman. He didn't realise at the time that he's penetrated and impregnated her, but sure enough when she showed him the baby (Janice) he realised it couldn't have been anyone else's. He took them both in and loved them unconditionally. However, Janice's mum was lonely and homesick for her family back in the Ukraine, so she left after a couple of weeks and used Janice's dad's credit card to pay for a flight home (and some lipstick and blusher). However, Janice has always had a spiritual link to her and never felt alone. She even joined the Communist party for a bit and bought a gorgeous fur hat, but they said if she wanted to come to meetings she'd have to share the hat. She was totally willing to share almost anything, but honestly some of these people hardly cleaned their teeth, let alone shampooed and conditioned, so she became a democrat and we've both signed loads of petitions. So, anyway, when Janice's dad sank into himself and turned into an envelope there wasn't anyone stopping us from getting drunk. I mixed us two gin-slings and then Janice made the most enormous jug of Margherita and we sat outside and wondered what to do once the jug was finished.    I said she had to mourn for a bit and wear black to school on Monday, but she said that while she would wear a small black rose in rememberance of her father, she didn't want to do anything too conspicuous in case the teachers started to suspect a death and called social services in. It was exciting, neither of us have been bereaved before and although I've never really thought much about Janice's dad, I still feel incredibly empathetic. I even gave her a hug and said not to worry. It was just like a 'Dawson's' episode. And that's how it all began, I'm not exactly sure how, but I just have this feeling that our lives are about to change forever. First thing first though we wrote a letter explaining what had happened, sort of like a message in a bottle, except this message was in Janice's dad. That's right, we stuffed that letter inside the fleshy envelope, stamped it and posted it to a random address. I was a bit nervous because I realise that if this were a film or a long-running TV serial that letter would come back to haunt us one day. But it's not, it's my life, so I guess we're okay. Afterwards we wrote a cool poem about how great it is to be young, free and with complete access to a drinks cabinet.

      Saturday. (Evenlode Junior School Fete and Jimkana) Wow! It's real hot. It's so hot that when I breathe my lungs start to sweat inside. It was so hot that I had to get Allan (my mother's Labrador/Dutschhound) to lick me all afternoon. He would lick me and the evaporating saliva really cooled me down.  I haven't posted for a few days because for the past seventy three hours I have been wrestling with my conscience over whether I can afford this pair of jeans I saw in town. I really like them and I figure that if you really like something then you should buy it, even if you haven't got enough money to. I mean look at the Queen of England. I bet she didn't get where she is today worrying about whether she could afford that tiara. No! She came from nowhere and through sheer force of her spending habit, she's become a world class head of state and gotten her face on every stamp in the UK. She's great. What a girl. What a worker. Also, I've been consoling Janice. She had a really hard time last week. She'd been trying to lose two pounds and had a great exercise routine worked out. She decided to put all the food in high-up cupboards so that she'd have to climb a ladder or get up on a chair whenever she wanted to snack. That way, she burned off more calories getting the food, than eating it. But it didn't work, she overestimated the calorific value of climbing on a chair and thought that it was about the equivalent of a doghnut. Consequently she's eaten more doghnuts that I, or she, could shake a stick at and she's put on almost half a stone. It's a pity, but, like I keep telling her, some people just suit a more curvaceous body and when they lose weight, people lose interest. Like that woman on ER. I mean who notices her anymore? Not ME! Bye.

      Tuesday. (National Burlesque Day, China)  Today I had this thought in Miss Drabinski's knitting class. I was pearling away when I dropped one and it was as I was looking at the cheap plastic floor covering that I realised there are some really clever people in the world. I'm not explaining it right. It was a really deep though. My first profound thought really. I mean, think about it. There are people who know how to send a rocket to the moon and what about Einstein? He was real clever, he reordered the way we think of the world and had great hair. I mean look.   I wonder if one day I'll have a great thought, you know, reorder the world, maybe I'll work out why navy and black look so bad together...hmmmm.

      Oh, you are never going to believe what happened today. Oh. My. GOD! Well, first off, let me tell you that I had one of the most boring Sunday's (should that have an apostrophe? I guess it's totally cool to have an evolving language so maybe it doesn't matter), anyway, oh God, I am telling you never agree to let your parents take you shopping on a Sunday...or ANY day. It was so boring. They took me to a shop and tried to get me to try on a pair of Dockers. Like. Hello? It's too excruciating to even think about. I only got out of it by spitting on the floor of the shop, like I was a retard or something, just spitting spitting spitting. It was great. I actually totally started to get into it, then my mom hit me and said if I didn't behave then she'd make me wear the yellow poncho again. Euw!   See! So, anyway, I stopped speaking to my rents and that seemed to work, they just brought me home and said they didn't understand me. Good. I hope they never will, because the day they do I'll probably be wearing chinos with a pleated waist and that ain't never gonna' happen. So, Today. Well, of course I raced over to Janice's as soon as I'd sorted out my hair. I'd had this really awful nightmare about having to set up a salon in Iraq and I could not work out how to deal with the hair there. I woke up thinking I was drowning in frizz-eze, it was really tough, but anyway, I though maybe it was a sign from God or something that Janice was in trouble (she has really unmanageable hair). I even thought about racing over there on my bike, but I'm trying to make my legs less built-up so I can wear this cool new pair of Calvins I got, so I just walked. When I got to Janice's I could see that the door was open. I was like, Oh my God, Janice has been robbed and with her dad away there would've been noone to stop them from getting to her and she'd probably been molested. But it was just Janice had left the door open. She was sitting inside crying and eating. It wasn't a pretty site. I asked if she was missing her dad and she just sat there, holding the spoon in her mouth and nodded, the tears were just pouring down her pretty little cheeks and I was quite overcome with the whole thing. She looked so...waifish (but big). To cheer her up I did a little 'sad' dance right there. Just a little foot tap really, but I think she appreciated it.  Anyway, I better move on because noone likes to read for too long.  So, when we got to school and Janice had regained some of her composure, we were just walking through the gates when the most amazing thing happened. We saw Jamie O'Riordhan and he said 'Hey, what's up?' I. Could. Have. Died. My hair was so bad and this badge I'd put on my jacket, just for a joke, which said 'Queer' was like, burning orange in the sun, just drawing everyone's eye. I was SO embarassed, I couldn't say anything, I just put my head down and pulled Janice off. But Jamie O'Riordhan! JAMIE O'RIORDHAN said 'What's up'. To me. Oh, I've really fallen for him. I couldn't stop thinking of him all day, he's so gorgeous. He has these Irish eyes, like all dancing and Lepracaunie, but not in a weird way, just really nice. I think we're destined to meet again. Maybe even tomorrow, in gym.  Anyway, gotta' go, I'm making a vest out of papier mache and medium sized strips of satin. See yah!

      Friday. Friday. Friday. (Christmas. Taiwan) I'm tired. So tired. Like my feet are chained to the floor. Broke up with Jamie. Well, in my head anyway. I'm not sure he was so upset, or that he even realised what a great relationship we've been having. I'm mean with the touch and the "Hey! Wassup?" we'd been getting along better than any two people I know. It was like dreamy for me, but that's all gone now. I finally said Enough is Enough is Enough. I can't go on, I can't go on no more yeah. I've been avoiding him ever since, but hopefully we can still be friends. JANICE! She is so annoying. You just can't stay mad with her for long. When she found out that I had been psychologically in a long-term relationship with Jamie (like, three weeks!) she said no to going out with him. I tried to change her mind. Said it didn't matter, but I think she picked up on my real feelings and told him to shove it! He was quite shocked I think, to have Janice refuse a date. It must've really hurt him, but NO! I don't care, I must stay strong and be filled with hatred for him. That way me and Janice can stay best friends, hopefully forever, and never let a man get in the way.  Besides I've met someone else. His name's Richard. He's so sweet. I saw him in the supermarked the other day. He totally stared at my ass in dairy. Then, when I was looking for some organic sunflower seeds I saw him again, looking at bags of wheat, but he wasn't really because as soon as I left he followed. It was really exciting because he is HOT! I managed to get a picture of someone who looks a bit like him. Hang on...   There. He looks just like this, but with clothes on and standing up. God, my posts are so long. I'm verbose beyond my years. I should be cute and young and brief. Bye.

      So, there I was, minding my own business, just talking to Jean-Paul about Mr Carter's toupe, when I saw Jamie coming out of the main block. I admit, I got real flustered when I saw him. I just get this feeling, down there, whenever he's near or even when he's not near, but I think about him. Like, on Sunday I was having coffee with my gran and she said something which reminded me of him, she said 'Oh, blarney' or somthing Irish like that, and I went hard, like real hard and I put my hand down, just to adjust it, you know, put it against my belly and she was going on about her new dishwasher and how Grandpa never puts the garbage out any more. Anyway, I started to touch myself, there in front of my gran. I'm the first to admit it's disgusting, but it was just the thought of Jamie and her saying 'Oh, blarney' and all that. But anyway, so Jamie comes out and I get a little tingle down my spine. Then he comes over and I'm like, Ahhhhh! (but only on the inside) and he said 'Hey! Wassup?' and I just tossed my head like a horse, a great bit horsey man and he said 'I'm taking Janice to the pictures on Tuesday night, she's cool'. WHAT THE FU K IS GOING ON! JANICE! BITCH DIE BITCH DIE! She is so going to get it when she comes round. I can't believe it, she knows me a Jamie are like, soul-mates AND she knows that I LOOOOOVE him. Oooooh. I'm so angry. I'm going to go and eat a Biryani. Bye.

      Monday. (Seventh Day Adventist Current Bun Bake-off) School in ten minutes. Just had to get back on my computer after my mom checked it out for pornographic downloads. It was really quite embarassing. I thought I'd wiped everything, but then she found this picture of Jamie and I was like "Oh, it's just a guy at school. God! I don't even know how it got there" I think she might suspect something. Yesterday she asked me if I had a girlfriend. I just said all the usual stuff like how I was working too hard. I hate lying to her. I'm thinking of making her believe Janice to be my girlfriend. You know. I could let her come into my bedroom and scrabble up off the bed adjusting my pants and stuff. Janice could just get one of her breasts out I reckon. That would probably draw my mom's eye plenty and, hey presto! She'll quit bugging me. Gotta' go. I said I'd meet Deborah and Cerise before class and style their hair. I hate Cerise so I'm thinking of a French plait, but Deborah's nice, kind of quiet a geeky, she only hangs around with Cerise to be used as a kind of verbal ash-tray for that spiteful girls ramlings. I'll do something nice for her.  Bye. Oh, this is a big wheel I found:   It's got two boats on it. Interesting huh?

      I've got this thing. I can't stop looking at myeyes. Like, really looking. Deep. In the mirror. I think there's something in there. Right at the back. like a man or something. There's a man at the back of my eyes. And he doesn't say anything. he just looks. I think Janice has been secretly dating Jamie, but I'm over it so I'm not going to say anything. K. D. Lang is so cool. Is she dead? Only a friend said 'No Musty, she's totally dead.' I can't find much about her. She's so cool. So is Ronald Raegan, remember him, the old president. I just found out off the internet that he was a MOVIE STAR. How weird is that? A movie star president, maybe he thought he was in a really long running sitcom. Like Cheers, but instead of a bar, he was in the Oval Office. Otherwise, why would he have killed so many people, unless he thought it wasn't real.

      Oh, darling, darling Janice. You're here at last. Don't think much of your profile though. Where's your pic? I've got a few of you if you want to use one. I think pictures say a thousand words so maybe you could do with one. Seeing as you can barely string a sentence together. Nah! only JOKING! It's nice to have company here. Anyone else wanna join the blog? Kev what about you? Or MAry mooo?  Come to think of it, you probably won't even read this. Maybe I should email. Anyway, sun is shining and I've got to sit on my bony ass and write. How boring. Bye.

      Being totally in Luuuuuve. I forgot to mention that Richard has three nipples. At first I thought it was a joke and tried to pull it off, but it wasn't. I figure it just makes him all the more special. Like a big candy-floss, but in an unusual colour, like mauve. Just wanted to explain. Bye.

      Tuesday (Lemons on sale again) Richard. Richard. RICHARD! He's so gorgeous. The other day he texted me just to say how nice I was. Aaaahhhh! We've got such a good relationship. I tell him everything and he listens. The other day I was telling him about my family and how my little brother had just started farting all the time. Like, when he's in my bedroom before I get home and then I'm there and there's like, this poo smell everywhere. And he didn't even bat an eyelid, he's so understanding. Then he said that he'd been having some problems with his brother...I woke up a half hour later and told him how great he was and that I feel so relaxed with him that I can fall asleep, just like that. And believe me, if you knew me, you'd realise how UNUSUAL that is (extra emphasis on the unusual there). School's been shitty because me and Janice had a fight with Claire and Magnolia Desiree. All I did was ask them where they shopped because I thought Janice might like some of the stuff they wore. They looked at me like...like totally homophobically and when I told Janice she went up to their car and spat on the bonnet then rubbed it to spell 'Bitches'. We didn't realise  their little brother was in the back seat. He's a dwarf and he was wearing a suit that matched the upholstery. Needless to say my Fashion & Photography lessons haven't been too great. Magnolia is queen of that particular class and she keeps sabotaging my crochet project. It's not fair. Still, I've got Richard to talk to and that's just...HEAVEN! Bye.

      Sunday (Gay Day. Thailand) Today is the day. I've got just two days left to get this essay in. It's all about the industrial revolution and how soot and smog changed the way people dress. Did you know that people used to wear charcoal pants, just to keep the smells of the industrial revolution away. Weirdly enough it was also the first time soap was mass produced so you'd've thought people might start smelling better, but nope. All that smelly work down coalmines and butthole places like that meant people didn't have time to even buy soap, let alone use it.  I don't think I would've been very good in the industrial revolution. Maybe I could've become a rent-boy, just a poor little urchin selling his ass to buy moisturiser. Hmmmmm, I wonder if that would work now. Mr Gilligan was hilarious Friday. He's grown this exceptional moustache. That's what he calls it 'My Exceptionsl Moooustache' he calls it. He went over to Vicky Studbaker during Math and saw that not only had she not worked out the circumference of her circle, but she'd confused pi with pie and started to work out the calorific value of a cheese and onion pastie. He wasn't happy and Vicky has this unfortunate tendancy to be shy, which can come across as her being stupid. So, anyways, Mr Gilligan just leans over her and rubs his moustache down her neck. Can you imagine!?! I had this shiver run right down my spine because I'm really empathetic sometimes and I just felt like wretching on behalf of Vicky. Everyone was so quiet the rest of class. But we're trying to persuade Vicky to take him to court for sexual harassment. Maybe she will, once she's stopped weeping. Poor little shy girl.   Bye

      Friday (last day of the working week)  It's all getting too much with Julio. I'm not sure if I'm ready for the kind of relationship he wants. He wants to tell his parents and his numerous brothers and sisters that he's in love with me and he doesn't want to go ahead with his marriage to Gloria (his parents' preferred choice of partner). It's terrible because I'm not that bothered. I mean, yeah, it's nice and all, having a big latino hunk beside me, but sometimes he doesn't use deoderant and that really bothers me. Also, I found out that he doesn't have medicare, he's one of that forty percent we're always hearing about. That would worry me too much if we formed a lifelong partnership, I'd always be stopping him from crossing the road in case he got run down and we couldn't afford to have him fixed. Also, I don't really understand everything he says. The other day he said "You're so impotant; Too wee!" and I was like, hello, Mr Hulio Englasias, your dick ain't exactly anything to write home about. And then I realised he was actually saying "You're so important to me." I was really embarassed for like a second and then I realised it was all part of our sexual socio-cultural exchange. But I don't like it. I'm worried one day I'm going to split up with him over something really nice he said about me. That would look totally stupid. No. I think it's time to call it a day. I'm gonna' tell him...after dance (we're doing the Rio-Rhumba and I don't want him to mess up). Bye. Love you. Bye then. M xx

      Yellow is a colour worn by several but suited by few. (Just look at Renee Zellweger at last years Oscars) The yellow shirt I'm wearing in my photo is the only exception. It's like my favourite piece of clothing and it really brings out my eyes. An old guy came up to me on a bus once and told me I had eyes like Vivien Leigh. I was like "Get outta my space PERV!" but I think he was just being sweet. I wish there was a national Yellow day, where everyone had to wear yellow. So many models and movie stars would look like shit.  I could let my belly hang out and wear sneakers.........and yet I would waltz into the street with my yellow shirt and look stunning.

      Oh my GOD. Your relationship with Julio is totally out. He is SO in love with you. I spoke with him at lunch. He offered me an olive, I hate olives but I thought Hey, this is a great opportunity to bond with someone different, so I put it my mouth and then spat it out when he wasn't looking. It was so funny. I thought he said "Mustapha is pass me the knife", and I was like... What?? I made him say it about 4 times cause I couldn't understand a damn word with that accent of his. By the time I realized that what he actually said was "Mustapha is THE LOVE OF MY LIFE!" the whole lunching population realised too. There was this big long silence and then people started to laugh. I tried to cover it up but then Julio whisked me into a tango and started singing I am what I am.... So embarassing. That song is totally 80's   Call me A.S.A.P to Discuss... Janice x  P.S I have some developments on the Bean front but I dont want to discuss them online ;-)

      Tuesday (Ladies Day. Glamorganshire Gold Club)  Yesterday was so hot my Adam's Apple stopped working. I couldn't do anything about it. It just siezed up. Mom told me to drink oil. So, of course, I did no such thing. She don't know shit about me. I just sat in my room and waiting for it to work again. It's working now. School sucks at the moment. Jamie has taken the split so badly. He's barely spoken two words to me. Meanwhile, Janice has begun an affair with vice-principal Bean, or BEANHEAD as we call him. I don't know what she thinks she's doing. She's playing with fire. It's one of the most exciting things that's ever happened in our school though and I'm sworn to secrecy. Last night I nearly told Julio (who I'm now having an affair with), but I didn't even tell him. Janice said noone is to know and for once in my life I think she's probably right.    Julio's hot though. He followed me home on Sunday night after class. He thought I didn't see him and flew like a dark shadow from corner to corner, following me. But I see EVERYTHING! I even butched up my walk so he wouldn't think he was totally betraying his macho Hispanic roots. Anyhow, it turns out he totally loves me. I've decided to play hard to get after the heartbreak of Jamie so I didn't let him touch me. I just gave him a smouldering look and tangoed my way through the front door, slamming the door behind me. Here's a pic of his brother. Julio's almost exactly the same minus the cat suit and girl. Just put me where she is and it's a pretty accurate picture.

      Oh.  Mmmmm Hmmmmmm These are the sorts of sounds I am so SICK of hearing. Contented sighs from ridiculously relaxed couple that just KEEP ON GETTING IN MY WAY. Honestly. I'm trying to learn to Ballroom dance. It's hard enough trying to partner Janice who has quite frankly got two left feet when it comes to anything even mildly syncopated. Did I spell that right? Oh well, I guess it just shows I'm an individual with my own way of doing things. I always say, everyone should have their own private dictionary with their own private spellings. Anyway, so, I'm halfway through the Rhumba when I'm like, enclosed by sighing couples who have all been given dance lessons as like wedding presents and stuff. It really makes me pissed. I hate all their fucking STARING into each others eyes. And none of them have any sense of style whatsoever. That's what love does, it inhibits your sense of style so before you know it your shopping in the Gap and thinking that it'd be okay to wear sand coloured slingbacks to a barbeque. I hate them.  But I guess it's because I've not yet found love myself. Well, not proper reciprocated love. Oh sure I've have my fair share of romances, but giving a quick handjob at the back of the bus isn't exactly a commitment, is it? Well, it is in a way, but it's really messy and not a bit degrading when the guy is whispering his girlfriend's name under his breath. Still. I'm going to pursue the dancing. Not least because there's the hottest guy in the world JULIO who was state champ last year. he's amazing and he's hispanic, which is so in right now. I've been wanting to go out with one for ages and I get the feeling that underneath those tight, tight, satin trousers there's a caring, loving man waiting to get out. I feel a bit bad. Like I'm two timing Richard, but I haven't seen him for like a week now, so it's hard to remember what he looks like and when faced with temptation. Well...................... Bye.

      Have you ever tried poking a finger in your belly button and smelling it? I defy you not to be totally grossed out by the hideous stench. What is that? I mean, what the hell is in there?  Maybe like, small insects do their business in there while you are sleeping, or maybe it's just an accumulation of crumbs. Little itty bits of food from days gone by. I mean it would only take one tiny miniscule piece of cheese to fall in there, go mouldy and hey.... there's your culprit. I've got a science project coming up so I'm going to name it "Mysteries of the belly button aroma....REVEALED" I think it should be pretty cool. I just need a willing volunteer to be my subject. There's no way I'm using my own belly button, people would totally lose respect for me. Maybe Judd. Any volunteers? Love ya, Janice x

      Hi there. Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh. It's tooo tooo much.  I did it. I dumped Julio. It was  AWFUL I've never had anyone cling onto my leg before. Then after the begging there was the violence. He pulled out a tiny elastic band and started hitting my wrist with it. Apparently in his community this is real torture because of the gentleness of their wrists. But my wrists just aren't gentle, so I just pretended like it really hurt and started crying, then Julio was like, oh my God I'm so Sorry. But I just walked out; a whirlwind of indignation. I loved it, but I kind of miss the dancing. Still. I got about as far as I could go. Just enough to impress everyone when we get back to school; JAAANICE! JAAAAANICE! I'm sorry I've been ignoring you. But I'm back now. With a broken heart too that might need to watch loads of films before it heals. Fancy it? Go on go on...  love ya Bye  M xxxxxx

      OH MY G O D! Well, first off, let me say to all those whose letters I recieved - letters or support, loving letters, letters with tiny photos of little men on them - let me just say that those letters kept me alive while I was being interrogated as a TERRORIST SUSPECT.  It happened on Monday, right after my last post. Apparently Molly Biggershill from my Home Economics class had reported me to the CIA because "I was looking a bit shifty" when we were singing the national anthem on Monday morning. She is a total stupid BITCH! The only reason I was looking shifty was because she smelt of shit and I didn't want to be anywhere near her.  Before you could say 'Greece Olympics 2004' these guys were round my house, three of them with suits on and personal organisers that were probably tiny spy-cameras. Anyway, needless to say that before I could even put on this cool new camouflage sweatband I have, they'd transported me, blindfolded, to this airstip somewhere. God knows where because all I could see was flat desert for miles around. Anyway, they showed me this orange jumpsuit and I was like, 'Yesh! What?' and they were like, totally suggesting I put it on. But I know my human rights and I know that under article thirteen of the Geneva Convention everyone:   'regardless of age, gender, race or height, shall have the right to wear at least two cool outfits every day of the week'   and I looked at them and asked if I could personalize it. They were great. They gave me a pair of scissors and some coloured thread and I did this amazing like Agnes B-ish thing that totally put the 'jump' back into jumpsuit.     My jumpsuit (so cool now) and my bed.  Anyway, once I'd done this the guards were like, oh, could you do that for me too. It was amazing. I got them all to strip down for me and let me tell you, some of those army guys are BUFF! It was like swimming in a sea of tustled hair and toned muscles. Nice. Those few days were the best I've ever spent. By then end I had my first collection. It's really made me realise that if I can't do fashion when I graduate I'll probably just die. Like, seriously! I'd just wither up because fashion is my life-blood, you know. And seeing all those guys going from a loose, saggy mess to tight, fitted desert-chic was so awesome.    Some of the guys before I got to work.  They were so pleased with their new look they totally let me off with hardly any torture. Sure I had to stand for ten hours, but that's what I had to do last summer when I worked for Mickey-D. And, yeah, they stripped me naked and threatened me with dogs, but I'd seen that done on 'The Fireman's Hose' and the guy there seemed to enjoy it. I didn't enjoy being pissed on, but at least I know that now, before Mardi-Gras.    The guys after I'd waved my fashion wand    Dave! (my best work)  So, by the time they flew me home I'd made so many friends it was cool.  Back to school today though and I'm gonna' get that bitch Molly. I might sabotage her souffle with some baking powder, but that little dwarf deserves it.  See ya M xxxxx

      Yesh, just itching with it. Yeah! Neil Young is cool. I just found out all about him. apparently he used to be a trucker and that's why all his music sounds like...well...trucker music. I wish I had a truck. I'd never reverse it, but I'd love to go forward. School sucked today. Me and David F had a fight in music and I ended up wedging this tin whistle up my own nose and playing out my anger towards him. The teacher thought it was great, but David just glared at me. I think he has 'issues' with my shoes, just because he's a frutarian and everyone else in class has agreed to wear daps made out of orange peel. But I JUST CAN'T DO THAT! I have things that I need to express and sometimes my shoes are the only outlet available to me. Like the other day I wore a pair of Doc Martins from Europe, to show my alliance with the Old World against the hineous cultural crimes of the New. And David just looked at me and said ... "COW!"   Like I needed that.  Like I care.   Anyway, I kind of lost my temper and told him that I thought stem cell research was the best thing since sliced bread so now I've probably had my phone bugged by the FBI or the CIA or an even darker force that doesn't have an acronym yet.  I hope they are Acronyms  See ya. love ya Bye. M xxxxxxxxx

      Monday (Mina's Birthday) Boring weekend. Me and Janice tidied up her kitchen. It's become so messy since her dad had his 'accident' and turned into a flesh coloured envelope (see my first post). We often just eat round there then leave the plates and cutlery lying around. Janice wouldn't've minded because she loves mess, except that she started hearing worrying noises, things worrying her door when she was trying to sleep. Then she heard them running across her ceiling up in the loft and then she saw something, like the size of a small dog run round her bed and out. We figured if we didn't do something she'd be eaten. I'm really boring today. I can't continue this post. Which is a pity because if I could we'd all learn so much about me. Do you ever have those days? Just when nothing is even going through your head and all you can do is maybe shop a little to relieve the boredom of your own thoughts? I'm going. Bye. Sorry  M x

      Mouths. Mouths. Mouths. That's all I see nowadays, everyone's just another mouth to feed. I took up a job down in Ricki's. It's disgusting. The boss has huge mamaries that just sweep everything off the counter when someone surprises her by wanting to order. They're like 'Uh, excuse me miss.' and she's like 'Oooh!' and sweep and there we are, everything on the floor. I have to go round and pick it all up. It's so demeaning. This one time the customer wouldn't get out of my way so I just licked my lips and knelt down right in front of him, he got out of the way then, I can tell yah. So, the reason I'm working is because me and Janice have decided to go on a trip to Europe and I have to save up the money for the flight. I'm cacking my pants with excitement. We are going to have the BEST time. I've already seen this fabulous boutique hotel in London and we're going to travel to Edinburgh for the Edinburgher theatre festival. Also, I found out that Barcelona has some of the hottest men in the world just lying all over fountains and things, so that's a must. IIIII can't wait. Oh God, please let me go.  Janice is a lucky bitch. She found a stash of money under her (now enveloped) father's matress so she can just sit around in Ricki's watching me work while she eats her way to a slow and early death. Does anyone have any suggestions of where we can stay in Paris. I thought we could camp under le tour eiffel, but Janice doesn't like the idea of a tent in case someone thinks it's one of her outfits. love yah  M xx

      So, I was walking down to my friend Briony's who lives like, not very far away at all, when I looked in my right hand and realised I was still holding the sugar shaker from breakfast. What is with that? It's like my mind is totally elsewhere at the moment (hence the unforgivable lack of blogs this week). I was like, get this shugar shaker out of my hand, oh my GOD! and I just threw it on the floor. Now. Interesting. Because I was walking through the park at the time and this old queen was walking his dalmation and was like,  "Hello, darling, I noticed you dropped your sugar." and I was like "Fuck off! Old Queen"  And, you know, I thought that would be totally enough to like shut his old jaded mouth. But it wasn't. He didn't even bat an old crumbly eyelid. He just laughed. and I thought. Hey, this old guy's kinda funny. So, anyway, he starts telling me how during the war everybody would take sugar to the park because it was a sign that you were a fag and if you wanted a bit of the old bum ho, it was the only way to make sure you weren't barking up the wrong tree so to speak. So, anyway, I was like totally interested and spoke to him for at least five minutes about the war and stuff. Then I wasn't interested any more and I couldn't help noticing that he had a really old bit of celery on his top lip. IT was really old, like way older than me probably. In fact it looked like it could have been in a soup long long ago. Oooh...there goes my cell-phone. Wow! It was this guy Ryan who's totally hot and has great teeth. He wants me to do a BBQ for everyone, but I'm not sure. Anyway, back to the old man, where was I? Oh, yeah, the celery. So I was about to just gag right there in front of him. Luckily, Janice came along (she'd been held up talking to Wayne Jaffreys, her new beau) and was like "Sorry, old man, he's not for sale" and took me to safety at the edge of the graveyard. (Did I mention we were in a graveyard?) It was good to get away, but it's left me thinking a lot about old people and the war and all. Gee, I wonder what it was like. Oh well, guess I'll never know. See ya M xxxxxxx

      I am SO excited. Finally Esso guy and I have got to first base. Despite his glass eye and his learning difficulties we are getting on like a house on fire. I've been teaching him how to spell and stuff and he's taught me how to change a tyre and how to make the most of a trailer. It really is amazing what you can do with artificial plants and some MDF. Aunt Billie-Jean could certainly learn a lot from him, if she only gave him a chance! I haven't heard from Dad since "the event" I'm just too freaked by the whole thing to even worry about it. It's funny, dating a guy with a disability has really helped my personality. I feel I am so much more open-minded now. Like, there was this guy in the park the other day hopping around on one leg (so CUTE) and I actually struck up a conversation with him. Turns out he was totally cool. He and Esso guy are like best friends, they even gave each other tatoo's last summer. His was on his stump and he let me see it. It's supposed to say "Confidence" in Chinese, but Esso just copied it from a take-out menu, I think it actually says chicken chow mein but I didn't have the heart to tell him. Well gotta shoot, I'm gonna help Esso with his kitchenette, love ya x

      Esso, Stumpy and I are just back from a weekend on the lake. We had such a great time! We built a fire with paper and lighter fuel and sang songs and eat hot dogs out the can. Esso and I are kinda plutonic now. He has the libido of like a goldfish. We would be makin love and then a minute later he would be like "Jan, wanna make Whopee?" I couldn't keep up. The fact that he called it "Whopee" was also a major turn off but I still love him. We went to the factory outlet store on the way home to buy Stumpy a new sneaker and I bought a fabulous retro poncho and a bumper bag of peanut butter cups.  Esso and Stumpy are so much more interesting than my high school buddies and they really look after me. Like, when I was being sick after eating marshmallows toasted on the fire, Esso held my hair back and stumpy sang me this really great song to keep my mind of the gross vomit. I think he has a real talent. It went something like this....  Hey Jan, Don't be down They'll smell that sick all over town Smile through those tears Wash away your fears  Oh god Oh Oh Oh Why did you let jan eat that Marsh mal low ow ow God never says oops  I wish I could let you guys hear it, maybe he could duet with Michele McManus? .... Love Ya xxx

      What a weekend? I went clubbing with my friend Mary 'Jockstrap' Wells. The reason we call her Jockstrap is because that's her middle name. It's pretty funny, huh? So, Mary is moving to London, England soon. She's pursuing a career as a nail technician, she's really good, I saw her do this amazing picture of a ship at sea on someone's tiny little toe nail. It had seagulls and everything. Apparently that's how the East Germans used to carry messages across the border during the cold war, they had tiny little letters done on their nails that spelt things like 'watch out, nuclear deterrent under threat' or 'big lady makes five'. They have to do the history at nail college. I'm going across to join her soon, once Janice decides whether or not she can bear to leave her new beau Angus. I'm like, 'HELLO! EUROPE!' How can she even think of staying here for a jock with serious '80s hair' issues and shoulder padded suit jackets. Eugh! I think she'll come in the end (once she's had her wicked way with him) Then it'll be London London London. I can't wait. I've even bought a marker pen so I can black my teeth out and make it look like I was born there. I've also been watching old episodes of this sitcom called 'Coronation Street' so I can perfect the accent. Perfect. Bye  xxxx p.s. Mary. I hope all is well there in England. I'll let you know when we're coming over.

      Wow! Today I flew to Edinburgh in Scotchland. I heard about this guy over there who apparently is related to me via like seven scottish Glen's and a bottle of whisky. I only just got here and managed to get into an internet cafe because I have to say this. EDINBURGH IS AMAZING! Oh, my God!!! There are so many hot guys here and also there's like theatre everywhere. I feel like I've found my spiritual home. Wow! Take me there baby. See you M xx

      Just minding my own business, watering my courgette plants (they're so cool, it's like having a pet or a baby, but totally organic.) when this guy comes up out of nowhere. Almost like an apparition except he had a bit of tissue stuck to his lip where he'd obviously blown his nose and I thought a ghost just wouldn't do that. Anyway, so he comes up and this was like May just a day after my last post and he said to me. "hey, you're really beautiful. I love your leg." And I was like, "REally? Thanks. I like yours too" Which I know is kind of gaggy, but I was too shocked to say anything else because even though he had a piece of tissue on his lip he was still totally gorgeous and had fine fine hair. "Are you doing anything tonight" he said. Aaaaaah! "No" I said. "Why? Do you wanna' ask me out for a milkshake, take me to a dark bar and rip my trousers off?" I didn't say that. He made a mysterious signal in the air with his finger and then he was gone! Like a phantom.  That night. I couldn't sleep at ALL. Not At All. So I sat in the kitchen and counted the lines on my palm. Then. Bang on midnight I felt this enormous pulsing shock course through my body and a blinding light (with kind of glowling red veins running through it) exploded in my eyes. Anyway, to cut a long story short I was transported to a different place, perhaps even a different world and it was there I learnt new ways of speaking and the mysterious way of the dolphin, which was cool. I became the yogic leader of a pack of dog like men and together we travelled to the centre of everything and lying there were all the ingredients for a perfect dry martini. So we got drunk, did a bit of coke, did a bit of dancing and it was great.  Then, I realised, I missed home. I missed my friend Janice and I missed my blog. So, I said to my mysterious friend (who had multiplied by many hundreds since our first meeting) I said. "Goodbye sir. I'm going now. I've enjoyed meeting you and reaching enlightenment too" And he made a strange hand signal in the air and so here I am. Back. It's coool.  Because I realised how making the perfect martini can make you so happy here on earth. So. You should be hearing more of me again. Byexxxxx
