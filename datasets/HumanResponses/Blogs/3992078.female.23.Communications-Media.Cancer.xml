      Well, thanks to my buddy Jax, I now have a blog.&nbsp; Why, I don't know...maybe because I am the world's worst emailer, that could be it!  I figured this might be a good way to keep a journal of my life at the moment, as crazy as it is, because I usually don't have the time to sit and write...but type, well, that's something I do all day long...hence, I work in an office!  To get everyone up to speed on my life so far, I have been living here in Toronto for 2 years now...a story that I know far too well from the amount&nbsp;of times I've had to say it, I came originally to study Postgraduate Public Relations at the wonderful (hehmmm) Humber College.&nbsp; Now I work for a PR agency, Ketchum, by lovely Lake Ontario (otherwise referred to as the Atlantic Ocean...not by me...private joke!) with only the Coffee Time to haunt for launch.  I have a faboo roomie, Nat, who is a great buddy, and we have a swell time...not surprising, we've never had a fight in the year we have lived together at the 44 (Jackes, for those who have not frequented our apartment), and I am glad it will stay like that.  Now, after many fights with a particular government institution that will not be named...I must leave my beloved Canada to go and visit my many friends who have decided to migrate to Europe for a couple of years or so.  Then by Xmas, I hope to be home and living it up for the summer until I must cease unemployment to look for a job...ewwwwww...  But that is faraway, and as of Tuesday week, I will have only 1 month of work left...yeah!!!  OK, so this is my first blog...blog by the way, not such a great word...kind of makes me feel a bit icky at the thought of it, but whatever!  I hope to post some pics up here soon...it will involve some scanning, and that involves time...  Anyway, for all of you who think I don't send enough group emails, consider this the best you'll get!  Hope all is well, and hope to catch up soon!  Ellie&nbsp;(aka, the EG)
