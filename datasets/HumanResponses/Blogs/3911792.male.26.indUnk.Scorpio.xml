      The new issue of IDEA is out now (issue 305!) and the subject is "Type Design Today". Here are some examples from this issue:       The magazine is 187 pages of discussion and insight into typography, and it comes with a cool poster (requires xacto knife and patience to remove...). It's a little spendy if you buy it in the states ($50 approximately) but if you know anyone in Japan that can get it for you it costs 2,910 yen (about $25).

       In my search for book content on Japanese typography over the web I came across  urlLink Japanese in the Age of Technology ;This is an interactive site with a large amount of information on the history of, lessons in, and views of,&nbsp;Japanese writing. I am using this site for most of my book material, and&nbsp;encourage anyone who&nbsp;has any interest in japanese culture and typography to check it out. I personally am fascinated by the view it gives on the unique difficulties&nbsp;faced in&nbsp;creating and managing&nbsp;Japanese writing digitally.  &nbsp;

      i've noticed some problems with typography on the web, mostly with resizing. when type is so small you can't read it and when you try to enlarge it the type is fuzzy and hard to read. or when people use slashes or dots to space out seperate words so they don't look like they run together. color is another problem, when designers use bright colors for the type and an equally bright backround it gives me a headache. here's some others with more pet peeves about type on the web...  urlLink http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/33938.html

      one big problem is what kind of font to use.  another more overlooked problem is the frame rates that differnt countries use. you need to take this into account if you don't want your image to filcker because you used the wrong Hz rate.  another idea is don't color you type w/ full black or white, this tends to causes visable movemnet and noise in your type.   http://www.typographer.org/  http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/41403.html?1090853211

      Here's an interesting  urlLink site  about hand drawn letterforms.  It takes you through Chinese calligraphy and Western calligraphy to what lettering is about and how it's applied to logo design.  Also there is information about typefaces and how hand drawn letters are conceived by humans using the mind, the heart, and the hand.

      This article may be a little lengthy but it is amusing and informative. It is written in a sort of dialogue/courtroom style, which adds a little more interest on the never-ending and tedious Helvetica debate. I never thought a discussion on typography could make me laugh. Its full of odd characters giving their opinions, one woman won't use the Gill Sans becuase she says the capital M is a strange shape. Designers are nuerotic and this article proves it.   urlLink "I couldn't give a rat's arse about  Helvetica, to be honest. It's a typeface, not a religious movement.'' .

      Searching for guidance on grids I found some tips on how to create a "professional grid" at  urlLink grasshopperllc.com . Not to bad if I say so myself. Personally, I'm more into graphing it out on graph paper, then translating it into the computer to see if it works with text.  Also, if anyone is interested in creating their own fonts from scratch, word on the street is that the must have tool is Macromedia's Fontographer. You can get more info about it  urlLink here.

      Ed Fella a well-known typographer and graphic designer has created several different typefaces throughout his career. Ed Fella has developed a very unique style with his typography and has designed several fonts on his own and for émigré. Here is an example of an experimental project that he has done with  urlLink moving type . The font used is a hand drawn font that he has created, and then set in motion with some wordplay on the magic of handwork.

      Maniackers is a Japanese design group who have both free and for-sale fonts available on their web site. Although I generally avoid most free fonts,  urlLink Maniackers  offers a number of descent fonts, some of which are in the Japanese kanas (katakana and hiragana) so if you ever have a Japanese client, you're good to go.

      Everybody should check out a free font site I found called  urlLink dafont.com . All of the fonts are categorized so you can easily find the font you are looking for. Also all of the fonts are ok to use in Quark and you shouldn't have a problem embedding them in a pdf. If you are trying to find a certain font there is a forum in which you can post a picture so someone else may help you identify it. Overall this site a very good source for fonts that aren't used so often and the categories make it very easy to navigate.  Almost all of the fonts are mac and pc compatible.

      This site has some interesting links attached to it.&nbsp; It also has some interesting ideas about when you should use upper case and lower case letters, and&nbsp;for which font each would more approprietly be used.&nbsp; I love the analogy used of all caps being like someone is shouting, it's lound and annoying.&nbsp; Also how the author mentions that times new roman, "Of course the word "plain" should be used with quotation marks here.&nbsp; Even the ubiquitous Times that is considered boring by nearly everyone is actually no more plain or simple than Mona Lisa's smile."&nbsp; The links that he has also connected with the article make it quite interesting as well.&nbsp; ENJOY!!!   urlLink http://www.webreference.com">site

      I came across this sight on a random search. The group is called All Good Things Typography. Their sight has many different features from font pools, history of type, classification guide, logo information, mixing, glossary, and  urlLink page layout    I wish that they actualy had visauls or examples of what they are talking about. It is a little boring without the pictures. =) Since we have had other typography classes we should know a lot of this. But if you look at all the catagories they have put together useful information that not only someone who knows about typography but also those that don't have a clue, could use in their designing.   I also found many links to the projects that people have been talking about in class. It didn't have my restaurant information but it talks about logos, classification, and history.  Hope this helps some of you out.   Drea

      This site gives a brief history on typefaces throughout history. The author Thomas W. Phinney breaks down type technology into four revolutions. The four revolutions are Gutenburg and the impact of printing, Industrial Revolution: Steam line casting and automated punchcutting, Photocomposition, and Digital. He discusses briefly about each one without leaving out to many details. And then there is a section where he goes through and defines typfaces throughout history, like for example Old Style, and Blackletter. urlLink history

      Another complainer has been located. I know, I know, seems impossible, but it's true. Seeing errors in movies has been taken to a whole new level in Mark Simonson's article  urlLink Typecasting , on the use and mis-use of type in period movies. I'm all for accuracy in movies, but seriously, this is taking&nbsp;things too far. Who really cares that in the movie Chocolat (2000, Mirimax) they use a typeface that didn't even exist during the time period the movie took place. Don't get me wrong here, type can be powerful, sexy, moving... but come on now. There's&nbsp;a time when you just need to learn to get over it.  &nbsp;  On the other hand the website  urlLink Counterspace.com  has an awesome little interactive refresher for those of us who have forgotten the difference between the ascenders from descenders of a letter.

      There's a site out there that does its best to play detective on any image containing a mysterious font that you can throw at it. It is called  urlLink What The Font  and although not completely free of flaws has proved to be somewhat useful to me at work. It also has a search engine that allows you to enter any descriptive word, to be immediately rewarded with fonts that match it. Its worth checking out - if not for its accuracy for its small measure of entertainment value in seeing what it comes up with.

      If you like type, and we know you do. Then you gotta love having 100's of fonts. This  urlLink site  is one way to build up your font library. Most of the fonts are decorative but their are some that can be used for body copy.  This site also has a good type  urlLink forum . People respond quickly to questions. I've used it to find font names of type used in logos and it also linked me to this  urlLink site  which has a large database of logos and info. about the logos.   These sites have proved useful to me and hopefully you too, can get some use out of them.

      Hey Everyone...this site is ectreamly interesting to play around in  urlLink will-harris Go into the typofile section, if you scroll down and see the essays portion there is some interesting commentary in there.  The disscussions are mostly on fonts that are used in the computer world, but that arn't always cross platform, inturn not making the font itself very user-friendly.  There is also some disscussion on what fonts are available now that work well in this type of situation.

      This site doesn’t really have any thing to do with typography. It’s just a site that  urlLink translates phrases in English to Italian, German, Arabic or whatever and vise versa . There are a lot of sites out there that do the same thing, I just found this one to be the best and easiest. I’ve used it a few times and I think many people in this class could use it, especially those discussing other cultures and countries.  Ya know, throw in a little foreign language for some added flare.

He discusses his process of designing new fonts. He's designed quit a few interesting ones.   Plus, I just like the layout of this site. It reads very well on the screen and I think this is because they implore many of the same rules that apply to paper, on the web.

      Wolfgang Weingart is a well-known typographer who was trained in the traditional Swiss style. He  urlLink started teaching  typography at the Basel School of Design in Switzerland in 1968. Form the beginning he teaches his students traditional Swiss design because he claims that one should have a solid foundation in clean typography before they expand to more radical typography. In his essay, Wolfgang talks about the advancements in typography and believes that mastering the letterpress will improve ones typography on the computer. Overall, he believes that there are no set rules in designing typography. He also believes students should be trained to solve problems through analyzing, exploring, conceptualizing, and applying several different solutions to the design problem.

      Here's a website I found that tells all about Max Miedinger, the Swiss Typographer famous for that annoyingly overused typeface Helvetica.  This site gives a brief history of Miedinger's life and who he worked under.  It also explains how Helvetica got it's name, "Stempel, the parent company of Haas, changed the name of the face to Helvetica when they decided to market it to businesses in Germany."  So if you want a brief background on Max and Helvetica check out this  urlLink site.

      This is the most  urlLink insane, and cool   typeface I've ever seen! When used it creates a city map. Each letter, creates a certain density. The more commonly used letters have a higher density than the lesser used letters. At this site you can read about the typeface, see some samples and download it if you'd like. This just goes to show you that there is no limits to what you can do with type.

      In my studies and readings on typography I sure see the word "too" a lot. Don't use too much tracking in body copy, too much jargon can confuse your message, don't take up too much space on the page, too much use of bold or italic styles is bad, do not distort type too much, don't let sentences be too long, be careful not to make leading too tight, don't use too many different fonts, too many hyphenated words are bad typography and difficult to read, and on and on. Doesn't it seem that sometimes there are just  too  many considerations with typography to ever find that truly perfect layout?  Go ahead, do a google search on  urlLink "too much typography"  and see for yourself.

      I found an article on about.com talking about the ever popular topic of copyright and the digital world and specifically dealing with fonts. "In a case that pitted Adobe Systems against a small software company in Florida, U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte of San Jose, California, ruled that computer fonts are no different from other kinds of software, and enjoy full copyright protection." It's a short article to read and relevant in today's file sharing world.  Here's the  urlLink article.

      While searching the web for this weeks blog, I came across this website that has at least 30 differnet typography sites or links to sites. I browsed through a couple of them. I found information about digital type, the history behind type, Graphic Designers and type, different uses of type, and so on. The site is called  urlLink Galaxy  I like when you go to one site and you are given listings for many more well made and very informational sites.   The link that I had fun with was urlLink Typeright  I like that they have FAQ's and Articles along with Personal insights from the people who work for Typeright. It's a nicely designed site.   Hope somebody finds this helpful.  Drea

      This website is very interesting, this guy explains the story behind the comic sans font, why he came up with it, and what it was originally for.  This guy saw that on a kids program in the cartoony voice bubbles they were using times new roman for the voices, which doesn't in the least look like a kid type font.  Thus comic sans, a font made to look more kid like, and friendly, not as sharp and rigid.  This also ties in with my book idea.  My book is about creative type, and using it in correct context.  I think that this person who created the Comic Sans font had a very appropriate idea, and applied it extremely well.   urlLink ComicSans  Jen

I wanted to see more pictures of some kind. But anyway, both sites talk alot about foriegn type and typographers.    urlLink Type Minds  is the name of the site. I hope that some of you get something out of it.   Drea
