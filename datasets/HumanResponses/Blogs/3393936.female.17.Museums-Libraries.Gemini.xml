      1)Mount Holyoke College 2)Smith College 3)Amherst College  Mount Holyoke is an all-girls college, prettiest campus, big on equestrian stuff, fun dorms, chance to take courses at Smith, Amherst, U Mass and Hampshire, 15-20 minutes away from Miles' house(s). Amherst, MA. (Sonic Youth lives there).  Smith is not as pretty, but just as good, but 40 minutes away in Northampton. Slyvia Plath went there.  Amherst is co-ed, but a pretty great school with a very open curriculum.  All schools accept transfer students and have accepted Simon's Rock students in the past. Miles said he'd be happy taking classes at Amherst or U Mass and we'd be close together and close to his parents. Best of all, Mom would help me pay for it and Miles and I would have another two years to save up to go to Europe or rent an apartment in New York City. It'll be like the 60s... Katie going to all-girls college riding horses in New England, getting picked up at her all-girls dorm by her boyfriend getting a BFA in music.   Yeah, this is a really good idea.

      Is it wrong that I really don't like anyone in Seattle? I don't want to get trashed and high this weekend.  Folklife  isn't even fun. I just like the overpriced food. Danny called today from Hoboken, New Jersey where he is campaigning for Kerry (he's a democrat??) and drinking. I think he was drunk. He only calls me when he's drunk. I guess that's not true. Actually, I can't really tell. I'm sorry  Miles  for being depressing on the phone. Just, everyone always asks how my summer's going and I can't say how bad it is to everyone. I watched  Elephant  today and was disappointed by how expected everything was. Cute blond boy though. I don't know. I just felt real creeped out after. I feel like I'm becoming a bad person. How do you stop the cycle? I just need to be in my natural habitat again. I'm watching  Blow Up  tonight. Danny apparently had sex next to a Blow Up poster and thought that was ironic. Yeah, he must have been drunk. I'm going to a FHS jazz concert to see Jessie play bass. It should be exactly like last year. Oh god, I need to be happy again. Only one person can do that, make me happy again. Man, Miles will probably dump me for one of his old girlfriends. I bet they never complained about their lake house lives.

      I was going to go to the pool today, but I   really   don't feel like it. Miles and I talked for awhile last night and he was watching cheesy horror movies. There has been a serious lack of good tv on lately. Today I'm going to finish my book, so I can start more interesting ones. Ha. Wet hair, wet hair, wet hair. So I made a list:   Things to do this summer:  1) Become a professional thief 2) Pretend I'm an adult and look at open apartments 3) Become a pathological liar 4) Stalk someone random 5) Be at Uwajimaya (Asian grocery store extraordinaire) 24/7 and get really into comic books (they have an amazing selection)  I told Mom about my Euro college plans and she told me that she would help me pay for an American college, but she doesn't think getting a degree at a European college will help me at all in anything, and even though it could be super cheap, it will be all up to me to work and pay for it. I asked her, and  why don't you support me at all?  She doesn't think I'll be able to get into graduate school. I have  never  wanted to go to graduate school. My only passion,  EVER , has been traveling. I told her that she knows nothing about me or what I want to do with my life.  My goal in life is to never be financially dependent on her. She can keep her money.

       VESALIUS COLLEGE, BRUSSELS, BELGIUM   Other intriguing cities: Berlin Stockholm Reykjavik Luxembourg Helsinki Amsterdam Prague  But is Berlin out? Is Brussels in? Is Brussels too small? Is the lack of incredible public transportation a major problem? Is the music scene awesome enough? The  NOVA  scene/group of artsy squatters sounds cool. The Vesalius College teaches classes entirely in English and is connected to the Free University of Brussels. And it's cheapo. Do people actually go to school in Bosnia, Lithuania, Romania, Croatia, Slovakia, Moldova, Armania, Transdniestr, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Macedonia, Latvia and Bulgaria? Should I?   In other news.. Miles and I are going to work at  Camp Zanika Lache  next summer. I want to be a lifeguard. [http://www.ncwcampfire.org].  LOVE!

      I wasn't really ever mad at Miles (heart, kisses, gurgle, lllove), because my mom is the megabitch. We're all fine now though; we bought  petunias  and she apologized for calling me an  asshole  and then tried to make me feel better by going out in the  inflatable kyack . I've been contemplating doing that thing Jena Malone did, becoming independent through law from her parents, but she's super rich, so that makes sense. Miles' mom, (aka my  dream mom ) bought the flight in time,  yada yada , and now Miles and I get to fly back together. I was really cranky, but now I'm just tired from the sun and tears and feeling sorry for my  sorry existence . My plan next summer is to get a job as a camp counselor at my old summer camp,  Camp Zanika  on  Lake Wenatchee , so I won't have to bum around here all summer and can frolick in the woods and swim and get tan and battle mosquitos and drive up to Canada on the breaks between campers and drink like my sister did. Miles should come too. And did I mention I wouldn't be home  at all  that summer? Rock.

      I'm so fucking irritated. Miles needs to get in touch with me  NOW . It'll be his own fucking fault if we don't get to fly together. His own fucking fault. Why can my mom only find one thing to do, and that thing is to give me a hard time? I know I have things to do. I know I need to apply for jobs. But I am missing  "The Saddest Music In The World"  to wait for Miles to get in touch with me so we can reserve this flight. Which is the  only  flight that is available for us to fly together. And which we have to reserve in  three  hours or less.  FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I FEEL LIKE YELLING FUCK TO EVERY FUCKING CUNT OUT THERE.

      I've been arranging my music files for the last hour or two and I found this mixed cd  Brenden  made for me first semester with all these sentimental songs and I got really sad all of a sudden, because he used to be so different. And so sweet and funny and so everything he's not now. And I'm really sad about that because we used to have a lot of fun together.  I'm feeling  really sad  right now.  Miles is so not close to me.  WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MASSACHUSETTS???  I was hanging out with high school friends tonight and Laszlo who has always had this uncomfortable crush on me said, "So, your boyfriend looks just like so and so..." and I was so excited that everyone knew about  Miles . Like everyone knows about him! I found out that Daniel Katzen, this redhead who I had some class with, a senior, makes fake ids for  $40 , so as soon as I get my first paycheck from my first job, yet to be found, I will get a  fake id . Apparently he's really good at them, and Washington ids are easy to copy anyway (apparently). With a fake id I can do all sorts of things. Go to any show I want, buy alcohol, buy cigarettes (not that anyone's going to be smoking them), buy porn, buy lotto tickets... Oh I'm just so  sad . I've got to stop listening to Nick Drake and Mazzy Star and stuff. God.

      So, I went on errands with Mom today and we went to  Broadway  to buy groceries but I escaped to  Atlas   Clothing  to search for cheapos. I bought a red flower mini-dress with  wide  straps and sunglasses (Jackie O style) and flat flower shoes! Oh my! And at this other store, Le Frock, I bought two t-shirts for $12. What a steal! One has a screenprint of Twiggy and the other a screenprint of the Kennedy family. I'm very happy. The best part is I stole the sunglasses ( shhh ) and I got a $5 from Mom to buy the shoes, but she doesn't know I bought the shirts or dress.  SCORE . That way, she won't bug me. I told her earlier I didn't have any money, so she's been letting me borrow from her. But don't bitch because my mom's so cheap and never gives me any money at all even though she spends a fortune on her little dog and yoga classes and new Prius' and condos on the lake. But now I really need to get a job because now I'm honestly broke. I saw some really awesome  boys  today. One had his head half shaved and was wearing a white shirt and suspenders that crossed in the back. Another was wearing tight tapered or straight legged pants. Like Ewan McGregor in  Trainspotting . Miles would look good in anything but I plan to tell him about those outfits.  I've got to buy some straight legged pants for myself.  And CDs! Lord, I really want:   Deerhoof  Vincent Gallo   Can  the new  Clinic  album

      1. Everyone is getting a car (all my friends + Chelsea Palmer) with a  stereo  2. Everyone is getting a job (everyone + LiveJournal Girl who got a job at Cellophane  Fucking  Square which is so the best record store  ever  and was so cool that they closed their store on Broadway) 3. Miles Pflanz, sexiest boy in the  universe , even more so than Syd Barrett and  Ewan   McGregor , is a million miles away 4. Mothers nag 5. I want to P-A-R-T-Y 6. Has anyone ever heard of the  Boredom s?

      Oh man, Iggy Pop.  Sixteen. The Passenger. Tonight.  Fucking amazing. My friend Dylan (trans) got a dildo in the mail today. It's actually like his own phallus now. He put a picture of it on LiveJournal. It was the best thing I've seen on LiveJournal yet.  So, I'm a slug. I slept until noon and now it's three and I should probably shower. But I'm still really hungry and I want pizza.  King Kong  is on TV. I have been somewhat productive. I researched flights for Miles to come out to see me in August.  I've also researched Chow Chows, my new obsession. I really want a Chow Chow. And a kitten, but not at the same time. And I got my resume put together so if I feel like looking for a job... I'm ready. I don't know why anyone would turn me down. I really want  Clinic's  new album. I heard the Franz Ferdinand single for the first time last night. It's not bad. Something to notice. Ciao!  Chow Chow!

      Hmmmmmmmm first post. I'm used to this awkwardness.  Miles had a sex dream about me last night.   AND TOLD ME ABOUT IT.  Only after I threatened to hang up the phone if he didn't.  I can say that here because no one else knows this exists.

      My birthday was yesterday, and Mom and I had a brilliant day eating fancy soul food and chocolate cake. My favorite presents must have been my Atlas clothing and Deerhoof cd. Mom and I blasted Flashdance music through the streets of Pioneer Square on our way to the Cinerama to see "Playtime" by Jacques Tati. It was really great and Mom liked it too. Sarah said that she is planning on getting me a Nylon subscription.  Someday I'd like to have a birthday where Miles and I plan a daytrip to the beach or something and see a band or something after we eat out at some Turkish restaurant. At this point I would like to have an apartment in Brooklyn and live there with a kitten and a young Rhodesian Ridgeback. And Miles of course. I'll be a filmmaker struggling to get into film festivals and Miles will be making music or being an astronomer or something that he would like to do.   It's really hard staying so optimistic all the time when you're having to wait so long for what you really want. I really want Cashmere. And I really want New York. And I really want kittens and tomato plants and a bed with Miles Pflanz again.

      Fact: June 7th is the greatest day ever and it's tomorrow and it's my birthday.  I hate people who race cars. I just want to stay safe please.  Miles sent me my birthday package and he let me open it and he made a beautiful collage card and Deerhoof's Reveille and it was all very impressive.  I'm going to give him a call now and tell him about my night.
