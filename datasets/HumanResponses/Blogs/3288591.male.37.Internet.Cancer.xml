      If you follow the progress of the  urlLink MARID IETF working group  …  … then you’ll know that the prospect of a spam free future is within our grasp. The champions for competing standards for MTA Authorization Records in DNS (MARID) are beginning to agree on standards for the definition of email domain usage policies. Once implemented, the MARID proposal will ensure that email that purports to be from a domain (mimecast.com for example) actually does come from that domain.  Most anti-spam pseudo guru types will try to tell you that this does nothing much for the spam problem – but the application of a little brain to the process reveals a massively powerful anti-spam system in the works. Most of the people who don’t understand the MARID proposal are of the content filtering, artificial intelligence ilk. We’ll get to these poor folk in a moment.  Firstly, if every email from a domain actually is from that domain, then “spoofing” (also known as “Joe Jobbing” – which describes the use of someone else’s email address without their knowledge) and “phishing” (dolling up an email to look like it’s from someone you know in order to get you to give up some info or cash) would simply cease to exist. At first glance, this seems like it has nothing to do with those hundreds of emails you receive suggesting that your sex life needs a boost, but the angel is in the detail.  Secondly, if every email can be proven to be from its purported domain, then the world can be rid of “bounce spam”. Here’s the geek description of Bounce Spam …  Bounce Spam is what you get when someone Joe Jobs you to an invalid email address.  Basically, this happens when a spammer uses your email address to email someone non-existent at a valid domain. The email server (usually a pretty dumb one) accepts the email because it’s destined for an email domain that the mail server deems as its responsibility. The email server then works out that the domain is valid, but the actual recipient in invalid. The mail server then dutifully constructs a bounce message – and delivers it to the source of the original email (your email address).  You end up with a bounced message telling you that an email you *never* sent has *not arrived* – or worse, you end up with a bounce message telling you that an email you never sent WITH A VIRUS could not be delivered. Either way, if you are not fully informed as to why this could happen, you panic.  The MARID proposal resolves this problem.  So, why would an end to spoofing, phishing and bogus bounces also be the end of spam?  The net result of the MARID change is the restoration of trust in email. After MARID, the only way to deliver an email will be through the use of a legitimate email domain. This, in turn, leads to reputation based controls for domains – so good domains who act responsibly and do not send unsolicited commercial email (UCE) get to deliver their emails easily. Bad domains (those that deserve a sever spanking) find themselves locked up within black lists for abuse of their domain. These policies cannot be enforced in a pre-MARID world.  Right, back to the title of this blog. If MARID succeeds, then content filtering systems will be switched off. Most content filtering systems are based on the idea that software can accurately determine desired from undesired messages based on the contents of the message. The anti-spam industry invested heavily in trying to figure this stuff out, but failed to realise two things:  1. We haven’t invented artificial intelligence yet – and it’s a long long long way off.  2. Had we already invented AI, it still wouldn’t be able to work out what we want, or do not want, to read. This is because we haven’t invented (or even proven the existence of) ESP yet.  One man’s spam is another man’s email newsletter (which is currently being binned by an ultra-clever, ultra-expensive false positive solution shipped by an anti-spam vendor).  If I ask for a glitzy, image saturated HTML based email newsletter from CNN, then I expect to receive it. I don’t expect some brainless software to “filter” it out for me. Anti-spam vendors have had their day. Now it’s time to get back to using our email powers for good.  Roll on MARID

      The EU seems unable to stop itself from legalising software and business method patents. I’m not going to get into why software patents are bad, as there are many web sites dedicated to pointing these things out.  Have a look at  urlLink http://www.ffii.org.uk  if you need the background.  What I am going to suggest is a solution. Simple.  SUE THE PATENT OFFICE.  The idea of patents is fine, and I firmly believe in the processes by which a patent should be granted. The big problem stems from the fact (and there are many examples) that the patent examiners tend to err on the side of granting a patent if it is presented in sufficiently minced patent speak (possibly because they really don’t understand what it means).  Given enough time, you can author a patent application for anything at all – and “prove” the inventive step if you use enough of this patent garbage speak. Don’t believe me? – have a peek at Google, and search for “patently absurd”. You’ll find good articles on thousands of ridiculous patents that have been granted.  The patent office needs to take more responsibility for what it is doing, and it needs an incentive to NOT grant a patent. Patent examiners should be rewarded for finding prior art and breaking the gobbledygook code used by patent authors to get to the true inventive step in order to disprove it.  The patent office (here or wherever you are in the world) will not change all by itself. It must be made to change by suffering defeat after defeat in lawsuit after lawsuit challenging bogus patents. The patent office must start to feel the weight of responsibility that comes with their power to assign rights of invention, and it must change its default behaviour to that of declining to issue patents.  One other change needs to be applied, in my view. Patent authors should be charged for patent rejections. This means that all of the time (in billable hours) that is applied to investigating the patent should be charged to the author of the patent upon rejection. The patent office should carry the can for the costs if it passes a patent. This changes the dynamic for patent application, and starts to ensure that bogus applications are discouraged, thereby freeing up the resources of the patent office.  Patents are good (even very specific software patents), but the patent office is bad. It needs to get a severe spanking – and we can all help by banding together to sue the pants off it (spanking generally works best with trousers down).

      My father was particularly interested in writing. He spent a reasonable amount of his spare time in front of an old manual typewriter and laboriously produced sheet after ink stained sheet of text. He passed away when I was quite young, and the only thing I have left of his, is an old leather suitcase containing all of his written work.  I have no idea if his work was any good, but the fact that the work endures is possibly the most important thing about it - for me anyway. This blog is hopefully a new form of enduring written work and, no matter how bad the prose, grammar, diction (and spleling) - I hope it endures and is of value to those people who find it.  Last year I was introduced to some really smart and creative people. After realising that we had similar goals in business, and in the tech sector, we decided to co-found a small software company called Mimecast – which is now based in London. The trials and tribulations of launching a startup are well known, so I won’t bore you with the details (I’ll hold that off for another blog).  I’m a bit of a technical general dogs body within the company. I try to help with a bit of technology vision, a little bit of business application, a little bit of technical pre sales, a little bit of software design and a lot of coding. I wouldn’t have it any other way.  This blog will undoubtedly contain both random and considered thought. More random than considered I can assure you. To me, blogs are like steam valves for an overactive mind. Sometimes its necessary to release an idea or a thought pattern in order to make way for new thoughts and new ideas. The problem is that without a mechanism like a blog, those purged thoughts and ideas may be lost to infinity.  The reason why this blog is called “The Mud Island Blog” is because I’m a slightly sun scorched South African who now lives in, what most South Africans consider to be, the very cold and wet England. If you happen to love the development of software, then the wetter the climate the better. I personally don’t think the weather is so bad, but I probably don’t get away from my notebook long enough to notice one way or the other. I live in a small village about an hour away from London, and there is an awful lot of mud around. I can tell the season by whether it’s frozen or soggy.  However you got here – welcome.
