      My class bites big wind.   Seriously.   Don't believe me?    Example #1:   I'm in math class today, right? I'm in a group with  Davia  and  Jaynina , who are both pretty cool. So we get like 10 problems for classwork that we have to do an answer key for. Unfortunately, we're doing  RADICALS , so there's a lot of confusion over the work, but we end up getting the problems and getting them RIGHT, as far as WE can see. We ask each other if we understand the math, to which we all say "yes". We spend our final minutes, confident in our knowledge of the work, playing  Tic-Tac-Toe  (I win 3 of the 16 games, Jaynina win 1, and the other 12 are ties). When we hand in our work,  Mr. Johnson  (our Math teacher) calls up Jaynina and two other kids to the board to do three of the problems. Two kids get it wrong, but put in good effort. Jaynina, however, can't even get to the first step of multiplying radicand by radicand and coefficient by coefficient. This leads Mr. Johnson to believe that we did NOT ask if we understood and did NOT work together and besides, we were playing Tic-Tac-Toe when we could've been reviewing. Of course, Davia and I protest that we DID ask if we all understood, to which Mr. Johnson says that we "should've given her a sample problem". Oh yeah. We REALLY think of that. Because of Jaynina, we lose  FIFTY  points off of an otherwise perfect classwork grade and spend the rest of the period sulking.     Example #2:   Last period today is Social Studies. NO ONE likes Social Studies, but we can make the best of that. For the FIRST TIME in S.S. history, we sit in  groups  that we can choose. I choose to sit with Davia because, as I mentioned earlier, she's cool peoples. Alejandro, our friend and resident Dominican who gets teased by getting called  MEXICAN  (don't ask me, I ain't start that, Garry did)decides that he wants to sit with us, too. We joke and say that we're the smart group because we all have high averages... at least higher than most people in our class. We call over Garry because he's smart too and become this "super" group as a joke. Now Akeem, this lil squirrelly kid is like "Oh HELL naw, they TOO SMART!!!" and people start yelling about that it's not fair that all of us are in one group. We ignore them and wait for work. It takes the class  TWENTY-FIVE  minutes to read a HALF-PAGE of text... the re-retards. In the course of this time,  Sequan ,  Loser of the Millenium Award Winner  for  FOURTEEN  years running, says the word "normalcy" as "nor-MAL-uh-Cee" (the numb nut), bringing back hilarious memories of his dyslexic behind mispronouncing the words "aisle" (he said "AYE-sul") and "pigeon" (he said "pid-GEE-on"). We laugh, he gets mad, so friggin WHAT. He ends up making fun of Alejandro for not being able to say " fundamentalism " right away, which is WAY better than not being able to say "aisle" at ALL. To top it all off, we have a S.S. test tomorrow and most people don't even know that it's happening or what it's on. Davia, Garry, Nime, Alejandro, and I do. WE listened.     Okay, now for the good parts of my day...   1) We had a  fire drill , which WOULD have been sucky-bus, but we had so much fun, that it can't be. First this girl went crazy, screaming and ish and that was friggin HILARIOUS, even if she WAS just playing... then we made fun of Garry cuz we saw this truck that said " Gary's Jamaican Hot Pot ", even though it was spelled different, it was still funny. Shaun got grabbed by the principal for pushing his cousin, William, when in all actuality, the fat-a$$ pushed him first.  Khalid  found a flyer advertising a restaurant that had his first AND last name... it was called the " Khalid Muhammad Restaurant " or something like that.   2)  Brandi  e-mailed me the next part of her story.... YaY!!!!  3) Amyra is finally  LEAVING ME ALONE  cuz I gave her two of the gosh-darn tattoos... ugh, all this fuss over some press-on B2K tattoos...  IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS !!!!     Okay, until next time, folks...   -SmOokie

      I called Brandi yesterday around 6 pm ( 3 pm her time ) so I could talk to her. She answers in this real lil voice and... well, lemme show you...  (Naia goes home, drops off her bookbag and gym clothes in her room, gets situated and picks up the phone to call Brandi because she wants to talk.)   Brandi :  Hello?  Naia :  Brandi?  Brandi :  Uh-huh...  Naia :  Hey... what's wrong?  Brandi :  I was sleeping...  Naia :  Oh... you want me to hang up so you can go back to sleep?  Brandi :  Please...  Naia :  Okay, bye...  Brandi :  Bye...  So I end up with no one to talk to (I didn't feel like calling Tanya, there'd be no real convo, and Laura would end up bored..) so I decided to change my clothes, lay down, and watch some good ol' television before I went to do my homework... I ended up falling asleep at 6 pm, waking up at 7, scaring the cahoots outta my dad, going BACK to sleep, and not waking up until  MIDNIGHT . Oh, yeah, I know how to party, alright....  SIKE !  When I got up at 12 am, I realized that I STILL hadn't done my math homework, so I had to go take a shower, do my homework ( you can't make up math HW in my school...),  get something to eat ( I slept through dinner and I don't usually eat lunch OR breakfast, so my stomach was empty the ENTIRE day except for some juice I had drank ), then go back to sleep, which was hard because I had fricking  CRAMPS !!! Ugh... librarian's kicking me out...   Be Back Later....

      Okay, I'm back...   Back to Claremont. I went there a few times last year when the weather was nice because these to people from the church offered to buy me lessons. They are frigging  RICH . I'm talking they have Mercedes with the phone built into the dashboard so you don't have to use a cell phone and get a ticket or anything. These people are  PAID . And they  should  be. One is a dentist and the other is a lawyer... I think. They're real nice, so I don't ask for stuff when they take me to Claremont. Once, they took me to Starbucks and Barnes and Noble.   Okay, enough of the sappy stuff.. onto what happened during  gym ...  Okay, we were practicing for next week's gym test so we were jumping rope and playing around because,  let's be real , no one really listens to  Mr. Smith  like that. We ran around being lil idiots for a while and I got paired up with these two girls I didn't know so I went over and found  Shaun ,  Garry , and  Fontaine . We took turns jumping rope and jumping in and  TRYING  to play double dutch and laughing at Garry acting like a fool. Then we had to sit down while Mr. Smith told the Big Brothers Big Sisters kids to leave, so we started laughing at Shaun because his legs don't have hair and we said that he'd be in the shower shaving his legs and singing " Toxic " by Britney Spears and we just about died laughing. Then I flipped it on Garry and said that his legs were so ashy that everytime he scratches it starts to look alot like Christmas on his leg. Then Arlety scratched him so the ashyness showed and Garry got mad. Ah, the life of the young and carefree...  BEING 14 ROX MY SOX!!!!!     I haven't called Brandi since the weekend...  *sniffle*  Squeakers... if you're reading this... I MISS YOU!!!!! lol    Okay. I'll see y'all tomorrow,   God willing and the creek don't rise  ...    -SmOokie

      Today we got the general breakdown of our futures, i.e., we sat down with our counseler and got told if we're gonna pass or not. I have all my credits except for one in Social Studies, but it's the teacher's fault, not mine. In other words, I'm going to the 10th grade, can I get a jalapeno (hallelujah)?   Summer prospects are blurry. At first I wanted to work at the  ABC Day Camp , but who REALLY wants to spend their summer running behind, dealing with, and yelling at a bunch of little kids?  I DO THAT AT CHURCH.  I'm thinking of an internship at the  Claremont Riding Academy  where I used to take horseback riding lessons. I love it there, the smell, the atmosphere, the horses. Even if I don't get paid, it'll be fun! Money's important, but it's not the ONLY thing... I think. LOL. Anywayz, if Claremont doesn't work out, I'll find something else. Like maybe I can tutor kids on certain days. Yeah, that'd be okay. I can tutor in... math. Math and  maybe  science.   Dad said that I don't have to do someting EVERYDAY just I can't be in the house doing nothing but rotting my brain on TV, phone, and computer all summer. Well, he didn't say exactly THAT, but I know that it's what he meant.   Ooh!! I know what I want to do if I work at Claremont!! I want to take care of the horses! Brushing them and feeding them and cleaning up... well, the cleaning up after them part isn't so exciting, but just being around them!!     Okay, enough play. Lunch is almost over. Be Back Later....

      As the darkness approaches, Smookians, the loyal, quirky, approximately normal citizens of SmookieLand, wonder what will happen. They huddle in the town square, about to debate what to do about the impending doom that heads their way. SmooBee, the Secretary of War of SmookieLand, makes her way to the podium...   SmooBee:  My fellow Smookians... our land has been a peaceful one for many generations... there have been no wars, poverty, or any hardluck of any kind, but now, I say pick up your weapons of mediocre destruction and FIGHT!! ( The Smookians cheer ) We will find them on the land! ( cheering ) We will fight them in the air! ( cheering ) We will fight them in the- ( giant mutant radioactive flesh-eating butterfly swoops down from the sky and devours SmooBee. It is followed by millions more giant mutant radioactive flesh-eating butterflies who attack and destroy all of SmookieLand... )  After the horrid massacre, only one Smookian remains... he stands and looks around. He picks up a rock and promises to rebuild....... but is then picked up by a butterfly that missed him and eaten...  + Fast Forward: 10 seconds later +  Highly advanced Smookians from across town come into SmookieLand, rebuild, and begin happy, successful lives in a span of  two hours        Oh, yeah... I was feeling creative today....     CURRENT EVENTS    1) Math progress reports are in. I got a 89.6, yet I am still #1... GO ME!!!!!!!!!!!! WOOOOOOOO!!!!!  2)  Mr. Fredrick  is being mean and exchanging food for actually paying attention... grrrr...  3)  COLDPLAY  ROCKS!!!!!!!!!  4)  Davia  has decided that  Antwon's  nickname is Abraham cuz he's so darned TALL...   5) Speaking of  Antwon , he fell off the top 5 in math, but he wasn't here today... I am SOOOOO rubbing it in his face on Monday...  6)  James (Spooky)  is now on the Top 5 at number 3...  Garry  was pushed to #4,  Kathelin  is still #5 and  Davia  moved to #2... YaY!!  7) I need fooooodddd....    MR. FREDRICK SAYS...   Too bad.  You want food?  Too bad.     SHOUT OUTS    1)  Davia  for saying she'd go to Mississippi with me if she could when my dad has his wedding there.  2)  Mr. Fredrick , in advance, for buying my FOOD...  3)  Luther  for being weird...  4)  Michael  for being a psycho and making me think he was gonna shoot me... it was only a laser gun, but he pressed it to my temples, so... yeah...  5)  Shawn  for ACTUALLY coming to Poetry Club... YaY!!! And for complaining about what I just said about him and getting this extra part that says that he won the last poetry slam with a beautiful poem...  6)  Brandi  for remembering to send me the next update of her story without me having to yell at her...          That's all for now, folks...    -SmOokie

      Now that the peaceful, senseless town/commonwealth/figment of my imagination of SmookieLand has been cleansed of its infestation of douche-bag cartoons, life is restored as it once was and forever shall be...   In other words, I'm bored out of my skull...     CURRENT EVENTS    1) This girl at school ( Amyra ) threatened to follow me home if I don't give her my B2K tattoos... I'm scared now...  2) We got our test results back in math.  Garry  and I got the same grade for, like, the THIRD time... we got 94.  Spooky  (James) got a 92 and  Davia  got a 91.  3)  Antwon  has decided that my new nickname is " John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt ", after that dumb song he was singing in Social Studies class... in retaliation, I have now begun calling him " Tickle-Me Antwon "...   4)  Brandi  e-mailed me.  5) I thought about changing " SmookieLand " to " Smookie Ville  ", " Smookie Town  ", or " The City Formerly Known as Smookie "...  6)  Shaun  decided that he no longer wants to be affiliated with  Alejandro  or  Garry  because they smacked him upsdie his head a couple of times... fortunately, he is still friends with me, though Alejandro and Garry are begging for forgiveness (he has two of their GameCube games, hahaha, but I don't lend stuff to Shaun, so I'm good...)     SHOUT OUTS    1)  Brandi  cuz she's ALWAYS looking out for me and talking to me and updating her stories for me.... YaY!!!  2)  My Dad  for coming home today.... finally...     Okay, that's all for today... see ya next time, folks...   -SmOokie

      *funny-looking cat-like cartoon character walks up to you, grinning from ear to ear just like all the other douche-bag Disney rip-off cartoons*   Douche-Bag Cartoon : Hi, people! Welcome to SmookieLand, the most mediocre place on Earth!! I'm your non-magical, high-pitched voice, annoying guide through the depths of the sick mind that creates this that IS... SMOOKIELAND!! YAY!!  *I walk up, look at the cartoon for a minute, then pick it up, beat the living daylights out of it, then drop it on the ground and kick it in its side before screaming "I'M RICK JAMES, BEEYOTCH!!". Douche-Bag cartoon looks up, dazed, bruised, and missing around six teeth*   Douche-Bag Cartoon : Ugh... see boys and girls? This is the essence of SmookieLand... ooh... I need a doctor...  *I shove the cartoon down a storm drain*   Me : Sorry about that, y'all. Stupid cartoons, run up in here thinking they can take this place over like roaches. This ain't no crackhouse!! *points to the huge bricks of cocaine behind her* See? That's COKE, not CRACK. BIG difference. Duh. Okay, so some people don't exactly get what SmookieLand is... I mean, that douche-bag carton tried, but when's the last time you've learned something worth knowing from a douche-bag? Exactly. Let's analyze the facts...   SMOOKIE (n.) (SMOOH-kee)- A stupid, lovable nickname given to me by my best friend Brandi to make me feel special.  See Also : Smookie G-Flow, Honey, Mookie, Boomalamah, BabyGirl,  , The Poetrist, and anything else synonymous with ME...   LAND (n.) (LAH-nd)- The solid ground of the earth.   See? SOO much clearer. Crystal clear... I mean, it is to me, it should be to you... shOoo... if it isn't, then you must be  "Sofa King Wee Todd Ed"....  say that a few times really fast and you'll figure out what I mean...   Anyways, down to business.... I made this blog because I'm bored... so this will be where I regurgitate the crap that I think up everyday.... so, in other words, this will be one of the most hilarious, yet morbid and mundane blogs in the entire history of Blogdom... ooh, is Blogdom a word? If it isn't, then it is NOW!! WOO!!! TAKE THAT WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY!!! lol.... Okay, so now I'm going to do my daily... umm.. things....      CURRENT EVENTS     1)  I kissed Kaseem (on the cheek.... SO SHUT UP TO EVERYONE WHO CALLED ME NASTY OR BAD.... shOo... oh, and Brandi... lmao @ that lip inspection thang...)   2)  Fontaine asked for muh phone number.... I mean, I already have his, but it's whatever...   3)  I got an 83 average in school... I'm going out with a bang, though. Garry and I made a pact to finish up the school year with nothing less than a 90 average.   4)  I'm signing up for like two programs... both will look good on muh college application (I'm only in ninth grade, but, but one is more recreation and the other is like ALL      SHOUT-OUTS     1)  MICHAEL   for buying me fudge chocolate cookies at lunch time... I LOVE YOU!! YOU HELPED TO FEED MY SUGAR CRAVING!!!   2)  TANYA   for laughing yesterday on the phone abot the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" and about "I will give you ingrown toenail... lol, classic, man.... classic...   3)  BRANDI   for proof-reading the beginning of my story...

      I'M FINALLY OUT OF SCHOOL!!!! YES!!! NO MORE HOMEWORK OR ANNOYING CLASSMATES OR WAKING UP AT 7 AM OR IRONING WHITE SHIRTS FOR CLASS OR ANY CRAP LIKE THAT!!! I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!    Wait....... I still have Regents.....  DAMMIT, CARTMAN !!! *sigh* Oh well... at least tomorrow is a dress-down day.  I'LL BE ROCKING MUH JEANS, BABY BAY-BAY ! Anyways, I'm getting my working papers today... well... actually... here's how the rest of my week looks...    Today After School  Prepare for Regents tomorrow. Fix cuts on my arm. Call Brandi. Drink iced tea. Clean room and vaccuum hallway (maybe).   Wednesday  Take Regents. Come home around 11 or 12 in the afternoon and enjoy my vacation so far since Mr. Johnson and Ms. Sassine didn't give us summer work.   Thursday  Work at Pantry at church giving out food to the needy like I will be doing every Tuesday and Thursday for the summer. Chat on computer and update my story. By then, I should be allowed on.   Friday  Try to relax. Call friends up. Use computer.    Saturday  Look for job at the ASPCA habilitating cats. I looked it up today. Volunteering with animals ROCKS!! They said all I have to do is commit for 8 hours a week for at least six months. I can go every Satuday once school starts and this summer I can go Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, or maybe just Mondays and Wednesdays for 4 hours a day... or LONGER!! KITTIES!!! WEEE!!!! Enjoy vacation.     Excuse me, I need to finish looking up my summer volunteer program. :)    -SmoOkie

      Yeah, I'm depressed...  Go put that in your pipe and smoke it. Shoo. I'm sick of everyone being pissed off with me cuz I swear, I will friggin' kill myself right now... or at least alla  THEM ...  It really started 'bout two or three days ago when my dad's fiancee comes up to me and asks if I drank the pineapple juice and left like a half inch of juice in the bottom of the carton. I told the truth and was like " I don't remember, but I don't think I've had any pineapple juice in about a week. " She says okay and goes off about her business. Later that night, she goes, " I talked to your dad and he says he didn't drink it, so you lied to me. ".....   WHAT?!   I'm like " I told you, I don't remember drinking it or nothing, so how am I lying about something I didn't know if I did or not? " and she goes " You shouldn't have lied to me, though " and I just walk away and forget about it because if it had gone any further, I was gonna lose it and start screaming at her.   I think a little bit before that they told me I couldn't use the computer over the weekend because I didn't tell them we were out of fabric softner... like I'm the ONLY one who does laundry in my house. Ugh.   Then today, I got yelled at by my dad, the principal, and about three teachers for not attending my school's educational awards. I was supposed to recieve the first ever Orlando Rosario scholarship ( Orlando died due to gang violence last year ), but I thought I was only getting an award for excellence in math, so I didn't go. I didn't WANT to go. So I find out today and everyone's all like " You were supposed to show up and everyone was so embarassed that you didn't show up and we had to tell the family that you had a family emergency. " SHUT UP! I DIDN'T KNOW!!!! I wrote a letter to the family, but of course, my dad's like " We're taking the computer out your room and don't ask to do anything this weekend. " Great. I've been getting chewed up all day and it's pissing me off.     It makes slitting your wrists seem fun.  Believe me.    I tried.       -SmOokie

      Okay, so I told my dad yesterday about my plans for this weekend.... wait, hold up, let's rewind for a minute....   If you've been tuning in lately(and I sincerely hope you have been), you know about Jason. :) Well, I was on the telephone yesterday with SqueekerZ aka NeurotiK aka BranderZ and I'm like "I should call Jason" and she goes "You can't do three-way calling" (if I do 3-way, no outside phone calls can come through) and I'm like, "Yeah, but if I could, I'd call him", so she goes "Well, if you called Tanya, she'd do it" and it was then that I realized... I'm scared to call him (see yesterday's post, "Pimpaliciously Yours, SmOokie").  In the end, with much advice from Jaynina and Fontaine, I've decided that I'm going to call Jason on Thursday or tomorrow and ask if he wants to go to the movies. Davia might not go, so this is working out BEAUTIFUL. I mean, Davia is real cool and all and she's one of my best friends, but it'd be awkward if it was all three of us and we're all from different settings. Anyway, I'm thinking of going to see "The Garfield Movie" or "Shrek 2" or maybe "The Day After Tomorrow". Fontaine said to go see "The Day After Tomorrow" cuz it's good, but it's all up to what Jason and I decide to go see. I'm hoping that he'll want to see one of the funny movies cuz it'd be more fun for me, but it's okay if we go see "The Day After Tomorrow" because then I can hug onto him on the scary parts. Heehee. One problem, though : MY DAD. He said that if I go to the movies with Jason, that Jason has to come to the house and pick me up AT OUR DOOR. Ugh. Only my dad.

      I've lost my voice and it is  PISSING ME OFF!!!!   No one takes you seriously when half the words you say get blanked out because you can't talk at a certain level. Ugh. I'm stealing someone else's voicebox and using it for my own evil uses. Bwahahahahaha. I should really go and get a new website, try to make it what I wanted it to be before when I made one. Unfortunately, I messed up that one and I can't really fix it. Grrr.... evil twist of fate. DARN YOU!!!  DARN YOOOOOOOUUUU !!!!   AnywayZ, the last meeting of the  Blue Nile Rites of Passage  program was this weekend. We went to upstate NY to  Camp Deer Run . It was actually pretty nice up there, except for the rain that screwed up my hair and the  FREEZING ICY UNFORGIVING PNEUMONIA-CAUSING PAIN IN THE REAR END  nights. :) AnywayZ, I got to hang out with one of my friends, Mariah. ALSO... and this is a BIG also.... I got the phone number of this really cute boy named  Jason . He's like 15, but we traded numbers anyway. I mean, what's a year's difference? Anyway, this is how the story went...   On the night we got to Camp Deer Run, we had a talent showcase at the cabin (which was really a very nice, two story building with about six bedrooms on each floor with either 2, 3, or 4 sets of bunk beds in them and showers/toilets. I sang a song, most of the other girls did a ghetto fashion show (ugh, seeing all that bad talent over and over... that's what hell must be like). Jason was leaning on the wall next to Mariah. I was on the other side of Mariah and Mariah and I were sitting on the ground. I thought Jason was sorta cute, so I asked if he was gonna do something. He shrugged. I told him he should sing, so he was like "Alright". I asked what he was gonna sing and  OF ALL SONGS , he chooses Usher's " Burn ". He sang it with a lot of emotion, slightly flat, but I've heard worse. He ended by falling to his knees and singing like he really meant it. It was.... unique. All of this was on Friday. By Saturday night, I was sure I liked him. We had made plans to trade numbers and probably give each other a call. He was really nice, laughed at my jokes, and was overall just a really cool guy. On Saturday night we had a party (Jason wasn't there). I was talking to my friend  Amire  and I happened to mention that I thought Jason was cute. So he looks at me and is like, " Do you like him? " and I keep going " maybe " and he's like " no, seriously, do you like him? " and I'm like " Don't tell anyone! " until finally, he says " NO, Jason's like my best friend. I can get you the hook-up, " so now I'm thanking Amire and telling him I love him forever, but by the end of the party, he says " I might not be able to hook you up because I'm trying to get with someone myself, " which I can understand, even though he refuses to tell me WHO he's trying to get with. On Sunday morning, we had church in a back room and before it begins, Amire tells me " I have bad news " and I  HATE  bad news, so I tell him to wait until after service, so afterwards I go up to him and say " So what is it? He already has a girlfriend? He doesn't like me? " and Amire says " No, he doesn't have a girlfriend and he knows you like him, but he doesn't like you like that. " I thanked him for at least finding out for me, but you know Naia does NOT give up! At lunch, I gave him my phone number, got his, and I'm waiting for him to call me.   I'm type afraid to call him in case I get his mom or someone else in his family, so I'll see if he calls me. I'mma give him about a week. Then I might call him; tell him I'm calling all the people whose numbers I got and seeing if they wanna hang out. LOL. My friend Tiffany keeps telling me, " You never know, Amire might be lying, " so I'm still checking for signs to see if Jason might like me. If he doesn't, I'd be a little hurt, but as long as we can still hang out. If he doesn't call me, I'll call him probably on the 18th of June to see if he wants to hang out on the 19th (that's a Saturday.... I think... I'm pretty sure it is...).  This Saturday, I might hang out with  Davia , maybe go to see " Shrek 2 ". I'm planning a sleep-over for me, Tiffany, and Mariah. That'll probably be in the summer, though.     Everybody out there, keep your fingers crossed for me and Jason .     See you next time, God willing and the creek don't rise,   -SmOokie

Oh yeah, peepZ have to turn FOR US. If I could jump by myself, it'd be cake, but oh NOOO. Ugh. So what, short post, boo on alla ya.
