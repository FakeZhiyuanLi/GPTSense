      Today my eyes pop out leh...OUCH so pain...all my sis(.audrey.) fault hhorrrr? haiz...jkjk  when i am all alone at home for the whole day so most of the time so i will hu si luan xiang(anihow think), haha...i will think of the past where my cousins(only 4 of us at that time) will gathered at my grandma house. when i was in pri 1(i very cute de :>), my parents work until very late so for the whole week, i stayed in my grandma house...sometimes with my sis. after sch...they would wait for me and we would go to 7-11 and buy lots of ice cream and stuff then we will share all the chocolate to see which is the best...haha...then the whole family(i mean everyone lor) will be eating together at least once a week. :p  years past...my grandma moved to JP there after she injured herself and for a long period of time the whole family did not eat together...now is the worst...we nv even meet once a month...my grandma has 9 children(they have thier own family liao) and 9 grandchilden, but it seems like all of us have been too busy for a dinner...we meet only during new year and christmas and when there are special occasions...haiz...but it is worserererer on my father side, we really dun meet at all...coz they live too far and my mum and me are just too lazy and we never make an effort to keep in touch with them...and i am really quiet at their house...like nothing to talk about... :c     but there are happy moments too...but mostly when i am with my 4 cousins coz we are around the same age so we get along real well...heehee...though we have different father(of coz) our surnames are LIM blah blah...that is why we are soooooo close...not now coz one is in the army, the other in collage 2nd year and another in the sport sch so there is little chance to be together but deep down in our heart, we care for one another and when we are together, we talk abt everything under the sun...moreover my mother very curious so she seems to know everything that happened...then when it comes to results, die la...me is like the worst except for chinese coz they all speak english...lolx :] i have our(me and my cousins together) photo with me all the time coz i realli treasure all the precious moments we had together! not forgetting my other 5 adorable cousins...they are still young and blur :o ...haha.   P.S: to my darling(.B.) lolx jkjk...thank for ur accompany when i am alone...though u can't talk :(...or else we can talk about everything hor? but i realli learn alot from u...she very 'clever' de worx always, aniway nvm...and we oso had great time together, sorry i now can't go out too often coz got exams...next time when i am free, then we go out and play basketball, k? promise u...haha  Love all of ya~ do take care always!
