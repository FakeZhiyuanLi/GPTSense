      Today has been good, i slept until 1pm and then had to tidy my room but to make up for the horrible task of cleaning my room i got to go to the cinema with my lovely boyfriend nick, i thougth the film was good, it was 50 first dates but nick thought it was boring and repetitive, hence the name 50 FIRST DATES. he also bought me 4 lovely red roses, if your reading this nick thankyou they are beautiful cant wait to go shopping tomo, havent got much money but i am going to spend it wisely and not buy loads of crap like i normally do. tara mite end up killing me as she gets irritated by my fussieness (SP!!) lol i just dont spend my money unless i really like something i think thats a good thing but she doesnt, she likes spending all of her money whenever she has any lol!!

      Why do I find it so hard to say what I am thinking??  it pisses people off because I cant speak my mind!  like Tara said to Katherine the other day:  "megan cant argue with a grapefruit let alone me or you"  its so true though I'm crap, its so much easier to just keep my mouth shut!! It saves people from laughing at me. Y do I have to be so paranoid!! rah! If someone laughs and I don't know what they are laughing at I automatically think that it is me, maybe because I usually make a fool of myself I just expect it! rah!
