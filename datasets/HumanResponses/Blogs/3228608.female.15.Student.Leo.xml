      so i guess i'll start with some lyrics that define what i think:       "it seems to me that all of us have lost our patience... 'cause everyone thinks they're right, and nobody thinks that there just might be more than one way to our final desination...... i'd like to think that i can go my own way and meet you in the end..."      -hoobastank       "Love is free, free is love... Love is living, living love... Love is needing to be loved…"             john lennon  well my mom is pissed at me so i'll add more later.... MUCH LOVE!!!!

      god.. it seems like i cant ever get a break emotionally. every time i think i have everything figured out, i get totally thrown off balance.. its probably the same for everyone but i just have to say it really sux ass.. im supposed to be writing an essay right now but there's just too much on my mind... i wouldnt dare say whats on my mind out loud.. i think im gonna push back the "mom and dad, i dont believe in Catholicism" conversation a couple years considering i just got confirmed today... but the people that piss me off lately, i dont think that stuff can stay in very much longer..even my closest friends are starting to worry me.. MORP brought up some questions in my mind.. and there was a certain event beforehand that is just eating away at me.. god i cant wait for poland.. my problems will literally be oceans away... until then im just trapped inside myself.....

      so you can see how much spare time i have... i haven't written anything since that first posting forever ago... anywho... i dont know why i write this stuff anyway.. i bet no onereads it but oh well.. im a freak..i have just been pondering friendship. thinking about people who i havent seen since sms (two years ago already... unbelievable), those i see as often as i can and those i wish i could see every day.. people from mags probably wont care about the following- you dont kno most of these.... i saw samantha smith at the movies friday... still seemed the same as she did when she left in 6th? grade, she reminded me of paula heiser too... i remember crying so much when they left ( the sad thing is that sam recognized me after like four years... do i still look the same? a lady at friendly's asked me if i wanted a kids menu today .. grrrr.. anywho) i was just reading some of anna's journal... wow.. lots of memories were spurred... i remember a sleepover with rae her and i after eigth grade, i dont think i will forget that... i really wish i wouldnt have lost that friendship over time.. coming out of sms i considered her a best friend...i can probably credit her almost equally with laura and rae for making me who i am today.... i hear all these things about how horrible she is but as i read that stuff, shes still the same basic anna that i called my best friend.. (sorry mags girls , and everyone in general.. this must be boring).. i didnt really talk to any guys in grade school other than blake... who i am suprised to say i actually miss... i havent talked to him in at least a year... (speaking of guys... jon fitch is still unbelievably hot... anywho).. wow i ramble alot but ill keep going cause i have nothing else to do... sarah.. simply a unique person (with a smelly little sister).. shrek... setting off her smoke alarm almost daily... fun times... i'll finish this "little" posting by talking about the only two friends from sms that i am still close to (and will hopefully always be)... it amazes me that three people as different as we are can be so amazingly close... laura has her roger ( whom i can never thank enough for making laura the happiest that she's probably ever been) and E.H. and all that comes with it (including so much drama) .... rae has her volleyball, j.o., softball, ect. (it never ends) and her E.C. (she has an unbelievable number of friends there..she is quite get-along-able)  and they both have social lives (something i seem to lack) ....the amazing relationship i have had with these girls over the years proves to me thast there is a god... i dont know how i would survive without them... i might not see them for weeks at a time but i always know that they're there for me and that as soon as i do see them again, my problems will go away (i hope i mean the same to them)... i could go on for pages trying to describe what they mean to me but no amount of words can really say it... i am the luckiest person in the world... omg this post is soo long... so ill just end by thanking everyone in my life that i call friends... you mean the world to me..... much love (and to my loreli and my rae rae, kiss kiss darlings...)

      ahhh.. 28 days till i leave this shithole ("america").... so ive been noticing everyone's complaints about immaturity at our lovely school.. no offense, but people, get over it... its not gonna go away over the summer.. in fact it probably won't change at all...we go to school with 850 other snotty, bitchy, know-it-all, p.m.s.-ing, petty teenage girls.. thats just how we are.. and dont think things would be much better if we went to school with guys... there maturity levels are significantly lower than ours (as im sure most of us have had at least one opportunity to learn)...so as for now.. the summer is just a time to escape the drugged-up whores that we see everyday and find some new ones to hang out with for three months.. Then back again.... but anywho, as for todays assembly... that was "fun".. the only joy i got out of it was finaly knowing that this hell that we call sophomore year is at its close...

      i said before that i would post my poem... and now my computer is fixed (yay!) so here is the one i read in class, then a new one....                        THE HAPPY POEM    Empty hopes and spoiled dreams, that’s what life is made of.              You can wish and you can want           But in the end you’ll just give up.              You can love and you can care               but in the end, no one’s there.              Why do I yearn , why do I pray       When I know I’ll have nothing at the end of the day        You can say life has it’s ups and it’s downs          But in the end, you’ll still wear a frown.              So now I sit here and I cry,         hoping that all the pain will soon run dry        Hoping that maybe someone will come to save me          Knowing that you’re the only thing I need          So stupidly I start to hope and to pray       Wanting the strength to make it through another day     Then I snap back to reality, to the cold hard truth.               I’m alone, what’s the use?

      i've cried all the tears that i can cry, my pillow is soaked and my eyes have run dry...  i've thought all the things tht i can think, been up all night, didnt sleep a wink... still im angry, hurt and confused...  i think that unintentionally, both of us were used... i cant help wondering if im to blame,  but its months later and you still feel the same... i've tried lying, to you and to myself,  but that left me drowning, screamimg out for help... im trying to be honest now, to not lead you on, to lay my true feelings out on the line... i really dont think i can take this hurt anymore, as my heart, ripped in pieces, lies dying on the floor... i could never have imagined things would end up this way,  your presence is awkward, i feel stain in everything we say... my friends say to let it go, to get out of my own head,  but in my head i find you, and repeat everything you said...  i cant put the peices together, cant get out of this maze,  and when i look to the future,everythings covered in haze.. i dont want to lose you, dont ever want to let you go, but i dont know if i can last through this storm...

      so, yah.. zacopane. ok. so on the way we stopped at several different churches and culturaly significant sites and by the time we got to downtown we were ready to eat. the tour guide recomended this old style resturant where the food was preety great. the aunts and uncles thought that our waitress looked like janet but the only similarity we could see was hair color. oh well... we got some shopping done and i got to have one last gofry at my favorite spot... ahh, gorfies..... we then got on the bus and headed back... not much happened that night other that we got drinks at the bar and the aunts were a little too excited about the clock turning to 0:00 (military time).... today we got a personal tour guide and headed over to auschwitz. im not going to discribe it much because i did so last weekend when i was there, but laura was pretty much in love with the tour guide and wouldnt stop talking about how hot he was (dont worry, we have several pictures of him). we also went to birkenau and i learned alot more about that since we had more time there then i did last time. after laura said goodbye to her new love, we went to wadawichai (not spelled right) where the pope was born and grew up. we went into the church he was baptised then into his house where there is now a museum. it was fun cause there were wooden floors and they made you wear slippers so nadine and i were ice skating and we saw the pope's ropes and alot more random things. we then went next door to eat the popes favorite cake, which by its taste we think it had some kind of alcohol in it, but it was good. the pope has good taste. we then went to a town whose name is way too long but it is the place of 40 chapels. laura and i explored the area and found a wc whole the others climbed a mountian of a hill to see one of the fourty chapels. we then went to the salt mine which i also viewed for the second time. nothing special about that except some creepy guy (who i really think was gay) who was making fun of laura and nadine's meow-ing.... fun times... we then came back to krakow and here i am now writing at the 24 hour cafe and aunt joann is amazed to find that windows programming is actually the same evrywhere but in different languages. we are going to go back to the hotel so we can have the free drinks that uncle john earned us with his complaints on monday. tommorow we wil go to cewkow where we have found some old polish ferut roots. grandma and pop are really excited so it should be a fun day ( other then ther fact that the ton is about 5 hours from here) oh well.. talk to you all later... MUCH LOVE!!!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;********mary********&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      ok so i left off on monday.... monday was basically all shopping like i said earlier... the adults saw the black madonna at chestahowa ( so spelled wrong, i kno). they had an awesome time and they can teel you all about it, pictures and all, but ive heard that pop joe was brough to tears at one point so that should be some interesting stuff.... so that night we all met for&nbsp;&nbsp; a nice dinner at the hotel and although the duck i had was amazing there were several things that were wrong with the meal including the wine that was served and the order in which they served the dishes, and nadine's calamari was definatly not calamari.. oh well.. but uncle john complained alot and so we got half the meal for free and free drinks tommorow at the bar and the hotel staff hates us... good times &nbsp; tuedsday (today) was Zacopane.. i was kinda disapointed as the weather was creappy and klinda ruined the trip... ok ill tell more tommorow after auschwitz cause i should get back to the hotel before its dark.. MUCH LOVE!!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *****mary*****

(it was the first time ive talked to her since ive gotten here so we both cried.. it was kikinda pathetic but it was awesome to here her voice. soon matt left and i cried again, as he was the last american friend i had made to leave. i know.. pathetic.... we sat and waited for the rest of the family to arrive and when they did (after all the hugging and hello-ing) we headed to our hotel--which is very nice... we went to the square for dinner to celebrate pop joe's birthday then headed back to the hotel for the night.... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunday..... today was the day that we drove to grybow to try to find some remnants of our family. we looked through church records but to no avvail. after seeing to pretty ltiilt town for a while, we headed back to stary sacz again. we met my friand helena, natalia, and ewalyna anfd her fiancee at the wine bar and after some beer with juice, we showed the feruts around the city. they seemed to like the place and i had one more chance to go back to my favorite lody shop. we then went out to rytro to meet my host family. either there was a misunderstanding or who know what but the family had prepared dinner for us, but they werent prepared for quite this many people. they graciously delt with it tho, and fed us all a very nice meal, after some talking and some final goodbyes, we headed back to stary sacz again so i could see helena one last time. there were some interesting adventures and i cried(the third or forth time that day) as we left stary sacz for the last time........ &nbsp;&nbsp; monday... not much to say for now, as its anoly ten in the morning, but the cousins and i plan on doing some shopping while others check out some sites. the time with the family has alreadt been a blast and the cousins and i are already planning another trip for two years from now....... ... this internet cafe is close to the hotel so ill try to update on wednesday (tommorow we will spend the day in zacopane).. talk to you later...MUCH LOVE!! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ****mary****

      so i just got back from my second to last amazing evening in stary sacz. i am really starting to reallize how much im going to miss my new peoples. i didnt know that i would find such amazing frriends in three weeks halfway across the world..... the program tonight was um, well... interesting. although you could see all the hard work put into it and evem tho most of the kids really put themselves into it, it was boring, long, and amazingly unorganized. the younger grades were adorable as they sang songs such as "row row row your boat". then they started OKLAHOMA!.... the kids did know the big numbers very well and those sounded noice and the ensambles went great, but the "acting" and dialouges inbetween were boring, long, and unnessecary. at the end they recongised all who had helped during the last three weeks (including me of course)&nbsp; ahnd presented us all with gifts. afterward, the principal of the school that we use for our school took us all to a very nice resturant in the square in stary sacz. the food was pretty good but the company was amazing and their was a band playing on the square so when we finished our meals, we went onto the secong floor patio and danced laike the stupid, crazy americans that we are. i am so sad to be leaving this country and its peopl...... &nbsp;and for my dad... i talked to joanna and she said that sunday would be a good day to try to do something together. ill try to plan something but either way i have their phone number so we can call later to arrange details.... se you al in a week and a half (or in somecases, in two days)... MUCH LOVE!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ******mary*******

       first of all id just like to say how much i miss you all and how badly im dying to see you.. to my parents  sexy rae rae, thanx so much for writing, it &nbsp;really does mean alot. as much fun as im having and as much as i enjoy the people im with, its lonley with out my favorite peoples.&nbsp; the other thing that i miss horribly is my stage (im sucha theater geek). im dying to be on it and to be q part of it again and if anyone has any recent info (ie director, which musical) PLEASE let me know...   so last time i left off at monday night.. here we go.... as predicted, the weather prevented os from having the bonfire, so we stayed in and watched freaky friday (not by the guys choice) evelyna's family treated us to some awesome polish cuisine and we sampled mutltiple polish beers (so i can recomed stuff when everyone gets here... me favorite so far is zwyiec)... we went back to the dorm where joanna's dad picked us up and drove us home (we gave the two guys a ride and if mom or dad can remeber at all what they look like...&nbsp; fitting two extra guys of their size into tht tiny car quite interesting... that was monday....    &nbsp;  tuesday.... the day was nrmal.. nothing out of the ordinary.. but after school one of the student's family invited us to go to an ethnic village near nowy sacz.. so we opiled into a mini bus and were on our way... the park was suprisingly large and thy had houses from all areas of southern poland from all different walks of life. many of them had benn inghabited until very recently, one man lived for ninety-three years in a one room house (he died in 95) i have lots of pictures and can tell you about them later.... after our tour, we met natalie and crazy paul and went to the sqaure in nowy sacz. we did some shopping and had gofrys then went to the beer garden in the middle of the square to sit and chat and wait for matt (that rhymed... hahaha) we headed back home and i took the bus and got off at the rght spot and walked home all by myself! yay me! i dint get lost or confused!!! anywho.... when i got home we watched the bootlegged version of matrix reloaded. the sound was not timed right and we ended up having to make joannas sister leave but it was tilla good time....   wednesday... there was a market on the square that eddie and i had a chance o explore during a lull in our work. i got a shirt that says "poland" on it (suprisingly one of the first ones ive found) eddie and i also discovered a quite large number of students skipping school and when we finally convinced them to return to school, they were yelled at by&nbsp; jerry and now hate us.. fun...after schhol was the dress rehersal for OKLAHOMA.. an interesting adventure.. most of the kida actually are doing quite well ans the ensambles look great (especially the boy's one)... after that we went to helena's to watch "gangs of new york".. a suprisingly boring snd pointless movie.... oh well... after that there was a party for us at the resturant across the street from the school. they served traditional polish food and played polka music(jerry tried to teach the boys to polka, didnt go well) we had an awesome time and sahared tons of laughs...   &nbsp;thursday (today).... school was kinda boring. i has to make cornstalks for the shin-dig tonight.... they are quite interesting....so as i said the big program is tonight and the students will finally perform oklahoma and afterward is another party for us at the same resturant.... i hope it goes well...    ok, so talk to you later, MUCH LOVE   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *****mary****

       yellowy-orangy color today just for fun... .. wow, i really am insane.... anywho... krakow was an adventure.. we arrived friday in the late afternoon to discover that our hotel was.. ltes just say.. "not the ritz" and that it was not ezactly "anywhere near" the sqare... oh well.. we dealt with it. after settling in and eating dinner we hoped on the tram to go downtown (at least a 15 minute tram ride) we saw the square and grabbed a beer and some lody and scanned&nbsp;the next day's shopping aspects. we also stopped on every hour to see the trumpeter of krakow play. the city&nbsp;is absolutley gorgeous and has a very european vibe to it. ( we were&nbsp;also happy to see buildings taller than&nbsp;four stories.&nbsp; en route back to the hotel we stopped at Tesco, the first 24 hour store we have seen in&nbsp; 2 and a half weeks. it was like a walmart in the way that it had everything you need but much better in qualkity, bigger in size, and not as hickish. we bought a few things (including some nutella and bread for myself.. i am absolutely addicted). our hotel is right next door so after some taling and laughter, we went to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; saturday morning&nbsp;after breakfast we went to the famous salt mines in krakow... it was not as boring as&nbsp;i thought&nbsp;but the elevator ride back up was more exciting than all&nbsp;of the carvings, chambers,a nd statues combined. but the best part was definatly that i founf diet pepsi for the first time and bought sevral bottles. from there we went to&nbsp;Wawel castle and simply observed the exterior while making up our own stories for each part because we didnt want to spend the money to enter of get a guide. we also saw the dragon statue before heading back downtown, were we met up with natalie, helena and crazy paul. we did some shopping for the rest of the day&nbsp; then went to mass at the beautiful st. mary's on the sqaure. after deciding that although the lody on the squre was awesome, it was too expensive, we traveled back to Tesco and bought some tesco-brand lody, some toppings, syrups, whipped cream, bowls, and utensils and headed back to hotel start for our own little ice-cream party (thanx to eddie's awesome idea)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunday morning we interestingly discovered another family in the hotel who had grown up in medina, right by karen and leslie, and had moved to russia, then to poland in 1995. we then started our trip to auschwitz and brikenou. during the hour ride out of krakow, i met a family from oregon that had spent the last month in hungary working for habitat for humanity (something that i might discover)... ausiwitz itself was an indescribable expeirience. although the first shock ofg bdeing at a place like this had worn off in dachau, auschwitz was completely amazing.&nbsp; i could almost feel the presence of those who had suffered and died there. we had an amazing tour giude who was extrenmely knowlegeable and could answer all of our questons along with supplementing them with stories of his own, including experiences of his own meeting survivors of auschwitz and brikenou. we then went to brikenou which was desroyed and dismantled mony years ago so althought there was not much there, the imensity of the camp as seen from the main gaurd tour was overwhelming. on the way back to krakow, i meet yet another person. a young women from ireland who was traveleing with her friend (who had not come to the camps) and was very interested in our language school. it was nice to have so many oppurtunities to meet new people (especiallaly ones that spoke english)... as soon as we got back to the hotel, we got on our bus back to stary sacz. along the way we stopped at some random shrine (it was frankly quite boring and pointless and the&nbsp; church was ugly).. we stopped for dinner at a random resturant and there finished our trip to krakow.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; today (monday).. today we had another chance to teach polish kids to square danse along with&nbsp; achance to teach them church songs. today was also karens 30th anniversary and her husband sent her a beauthiful bouqet of thirty roses(although see loved them, she still wishes that he could be here).. tonight we are going to evalyna's again for another try at a bonfire (although the weather isnt looking too good. also taoday, we are going to the mayor's office for something at 4:30.. i have no idea what it is.. you will find out later....&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as i begin my last week here, i am depressed at th hought of leaving. dont get me wrong, i dream of home every day... but just the thought of leaving this place and these people make me miss it already...... hopefully helena will be coming to E.C. this fall so ill see her again and have a&nbsp; chance to introduce her to you all (shes awesome).... thats all for now!!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MUCH LOVE!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ****mary****

      we just got home from zacopane a few hours ago and it was awesomely amazing. we were very lucky to discover that two of the polish helpers would be allowed to join us for the weekend; paul, who is about 19 and visited the US a few years ago to attend padua and helena who is 17 and will hpefully be coming to the US this fall to attend EC. the trip did start on a bad note, as one tiny bus with too few seats showed up in place of the oversized coach we have had the whole time. although mrs boron fought hard, they did not give us a coach but ordered a cab to take the extra paople. the ride weas kinda awful, but when we arrived it was well worth it. zacopane is a beautiful old ski area that was a nominated locatin for the 06 olympics. our hotel, which was called the hyrny (but we liked to cal it horny) was only a five minute walk from the main strip. the first night (friday) i went with karen (mrs borons daughter), leslie, amanda, helena, ed, paul, matt and kevin and explored the strip before finding a awesome little pub and settling in with our juice beers (or in some of the boy's case, 190 proof shots). we headed back to the hotel (bringing along several of the resturant's beer glasses) where there was a pool table, ping pong table and putt putt course. much to our suprise we found that there was a danse party going on in the basement. we played pool and ping pong for a while before headong downstairs to the party where they were playing songs such as mambo #5 and a song entitled "oh, chiwawa"... we left quite quickly).     saturday started with a trip to a mountain that paul was dying to have us visit. we got ther equite early as to avoid lines but sadly the sky was so foggy and cloudy that is was impossible to see anything.... more later.. we have reservations to a resturant run by a parent of a language school student (i guess they have awesome perogies...

      today after scool a group of eleven of us including five polish peoplewent to nowy sacz after school. we had some awesome ice cream while the peole with traveler's checks finally had a chance to cash them. we then went to the town squre. there was a beer garden type thing right in the center so we stopped for some drinks (i had a juice beer, which was really quite good- dont worry mom... there was an adult there to keep us in check). we thrn went to some of the shops. the clothes are very nice and unique and not expensive at all. we didnt have much time to shop though, as all the shops close at 6. we came home on the bus which wzas quite interesting as we were yelled and cussed at by some insane polish lady.. fun times.. when we got home we were treated to perogies at a resturant across the street from the school. the perogies were awesome. we had the choice of potato and cheese, cabbage, blueberry, or strawberry (it tried all except for the cabbage)..... i hope to go back to nowy sacz several times before i leave... if any girl want a shirt from me as a sovinier, give me your size in a commment thingy.... thats all for now (except i heard jet playing on the radio in one if the shops-that excited me)... oh well...

      the last couple days have been really awesome.. other than the fact that there seems to remain a sign on our forheads that says "american", everyone is constsantly staring like we were just sent from mars. yesterday after school we had a chance to go visit joanna's friend mary.  mary spends alot of time with us and speaks some english (she goes to the language scool) so we get along well. mary lives at with her family at place that seems to be some kind of summer sports camp (i think her parents are in charge). we played some basketball and attemptd to play some tennis. we wemt inside and played battleship and "sims" (yes, its the same computer game). i have been quite aware of the presence of american culture in poland these last few days. you can hear american songs on the radio almost constantly (sadly they love avril lavigne). we also compared magazined with joanna yesterday; her polish teen magazine to my cosmo-girl (thank you lorali). we saw tone aof similarities and countless american stars (i.e. britney, christina, toby miguire, elijah wood, blink 182, eminem, ect.) i even saw an american music video at a resturant. the other thing i noticed is that since they dont know the meanings or significance of the words we consider profane, they play them on the radio unknowingly all the time. thats all for know... see you later...                          ************mary************

      tadoy was my second day at the language school. i am helping leslie (ms boron's grandaughter). there are eight groups of about twenty students in the upper grades and two classes in the elemantary school.i have been making unbelievably large numbers of copies for the teachers, because nita bedocs needs 140 copies of several different 3-page songs. the students are watching "oklahoma" but dont seem to be very entertained by it at all... oh well... yesterday we wnt to a swimming pool with joanna's friend mary and her mother. it was quite a switch from the US as i was the inly girl wearing a bikini and all the guys were wearing speedos (not a pretty sight) it was fun tho.... this weekend we are taking another trip tp some other city of which name i cannot remember (its really messed up)... i have to get to the bank and back to the school before it rains so ill update again later....MUCH LOVE!!                       ******mary********

      here started my second july 4th out of country. my host family let us sleep in, which was awesome considering the previous day's journies. we attended church at 11 (thier only mass time). the church was full and people were crowded in standing everywhere(including a boyscout troop in full uniform who seemed to be returning from a camping trip. i tried to pay attention for the entire mass, but it was difficult since it was in polish and i couldnt see the altar from my spot... i tried to folow anolng with the order of things and said the prayers in my head. they did kneel alot and my knees hurt afterward.... later, my family took amanda and i sight seeing. we walked past the ruins of a fifteenth century castle andthrough thier town. joann's friend mary (hehe) also walked with us. it was nice to get out nd walk in the mountains, but after a while i began to wonder if we'd ever turn around ( i wasnt bored though, amnda talks more than rae and i combined.. i think i know her entire family's life history already)... finally, we reached our apperant destination. there was a small party/festival being held by a sports camp in my family's town. they had a weird version of tug of war, hammering competitions and basketball, where the baskets were on the backs of running people... quite interesting... there we met an american boy who's parents were polish. he comes to poland from florida every summer... we took a ride the\rough the woods on a horse carraigebefore starting our way home.. we took a different route this time and went high in the mountains where we had a "kodak moment" view of the beautiful town). we stopped to met joann's granparents and and and uncle and cousins on thier adorable farm. her gradndmother fed us lots of amazing cake.. we then finished out hike back home where the family made the closest things to hot doge that they had for us. after that we watched a possible bootlaged version of scooby-doo with polish subtitles.... the thought that kept running through my head was how wierd it was to spend a day usually meant for celebrating my country appreciating a country half way across the world.... i would write more but i have to go back to the school in time for my family to pick me up.... MUCH LOVE!!!!              ****mary**** p.s.- sorry i keep on publishing each post twice, i just have to be sure its there!!

      hey.. here i am sitting in the middle of an internet cafe in stary sacz, polnad and i still cant believe it. my trip to slovakia on saturday was amazing. even the bus ride was interesting.i talked to everyone alot and discussed with kevin why in the world a guy like him would study cosmotology. we were driving along and passed by what seemed to be two hitch hikers and ed and i were joking around about picking them up when the bus lurhed to a stop and started to back up slowly toward the people. they started to run toward th bus and suddenly there were more men like them running toward the bus from all directions carrying buckets. we soon found out that these were gypsy men selling wild mushrooms and the bus driver bought at least four bags to take home to his wife. appearantly the mushrooms are better and also cheaper in slovakia. but we also found out that it was illegal to take the mushrooms back into poland so we stopped on the way back to hide them under the bus.... druing the day we climbed two mountians. the first time to walk through a cave where they were playing different music in every "room". in the last "room". where the accoustics are supposedly the best, all the polish people on the tour broke out singing some random song in unison. when finished we were asked to sing an american song, upon which request ms. bedocs started to lead us in the finstones theme song... and interesting experience... the second mountain we took a cable car to the top, then walked dowm into a crevice in the moutain where there was a beautiful waterfall. i climbed on to the top of the waterfall (mom would have had a heart attck) i also had more oppurtunities to talk to matt ( i tried to explain the layout of the resar propeties where i live and suprisingly he understood)... after this we returned to poland on a long bus trip that was not at all boring... i have lots of pictures from that day.. hopefully good ones to because one of the teachers, laura, was attempting to show my the basics of taking a good picture....in whole.. it was an awesome day

      Dzien dobry! i think that this is the only thing that is going to work over here, so tell everyone to come here if they want an update. The plane ride was about 8 and a half hours and was suprisingly easy. during the layover in CHigaco i got to know my fellow travelers a little better. We are a group of fifteen. There are six teenagers, me anna riedel (sp?), a girl named Amanda (16), eddy (17)who is awesomely nice and wants to be a chef, kevin (17)who is really funny and wants to be a cosmotologist, and matt (18) who i talked to for almost the whole layover and is really intelligent. he is going to Boston College in the fall. the drive to stary sacz, which should have been an hour and a half, turned out to be over four because of traffic delays. we stopped to meet and visit with mrs. boron's cousin who had a beautiful garden. We continued, passing through nowy sacz, which has the second largest town square in poland beside krakow. all the building are absolutely beatiful. the area is rich with awesome culture. when we areivved in stary sacz, we went to thr dorm that the teachers would stay at. there were many children ther who knew minimal english. they were trying to ask us questions and makie conversation but all they knew were things like "what is your name". they would ask us a qu8estion and than laugh histarically at us and talk amongst themselves in polish.our host families soon arrived. Amanda and i are staying together with a girl whose anerican name is Joann. we live withe her, her two parents and her younger sister who is 8. the house is very nice. it is three stories high and amanda and i have the third floor to ourselves. we each have a sperate room and share a bathroom seperate from the rest of the family. they are extremely nice and are feedin us every five seconds. joann speaks pretty good english and the mother knows some things here and there. the fatherwalks around with his translation book asking us questions and the little sister just runs aroun whispering to her family and smiling.  today at the school we held placement tests in order to seperate the childeren for classes on monday. as we stood in the front of the gym where they gathered, all eyes were on us. when the testing started, we found out that polish children love to cheat- but they arent very good at it... after that i went with kevin and eddy and three polish girls (including the one who stayed with trisha edwards) to walk around stary sacz. the town is vey quaint and beautiful. we saw a church with a cloistered convent and a market place.tommorow we are going to slovakia (sp?) for the day.  i miss you all alot and wish that everyone could have come with me, but ill have lots of pictures. MUCH LOVE,                ****mary*** p.s.- rae rae, ive thought about you and your family alor and im praying for you. i love you so much!! i wish i could be ther at the funeral today, but that abvioulsy isnt possible, so ill be there "in spirit" and ill be thinkin of you.
