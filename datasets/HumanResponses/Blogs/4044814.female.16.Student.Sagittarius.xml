       Alright, sorry, it's been a while... but I'm back, and like I said before, all I did was work on those stupid galleries, amd hang out with Ashley... But today, I am starting something new, it's a different kind of a diet. Everytime I eat junk or something other than my 3 meals of the day, I have to write it down, and at the end oof the day put it all here. And everyday, I have to try to eat less and less, and hopefully that'll one day make me junk food free, and happy. My goal is to lose wait for prom, not back to school, cause that's unrealistic, but by prom, I'm gonna be hot! So guess I'll be back tonight with everything I've eaten...    &nbsp;  Lata xx

        Yesterday was another random day of getting new pictures of Paris for her gallery. I also had the pleasant task of changing all these 700 pictures into thumbnails, by cropping, changing image sizes and making it brown. I atleast got another chance to relax and go to Costco and see A Cinderella Story, which was cute. It was a good time and then I came back and had an even funner time making....wait for it....more thumbnails, and I am not even close to beeing finished. So yeah, that was my day/night, and I'll be back tonight to write about today...although I think I can give you a preview now....     &nbsp;   THUMBNAILS     &nbsp;   Lata xx

        I spent all day doing the same thing... I started by fixing a few of the banners for the site, (Paris, Alex's and Elyzabeths) and then went to work. I changed the whole layout four Paul's gallery and fixed a few errors on Paris'. I also deleted all of the junk that was uploaded on the site. So now, after all my hard work, I'm back at square one, and must restart everything! Our gallery has gone through many fazes. First it was like 12 pics on one page... then 3 catagories on one page, then it was 10 pages of random pictures, and now... now we have&nbsp;an extensive selection of pictures to add. So after I fixed all the layouts, I started grouping up all of Paris' pics, which didn't take long&nbsp;cause I had started yesterday, but when it came&nbsp;time to do Paul's it took&nbsp;ALL day! I took a small break to eat, and hang out with my niece Jordan who came by today. She is such a hottie, I love her to death. (She's 1 year old now and has the blondest hair and the bluest eyes!) I was glad to see her cause it had been two weeks since I saw her or my sister, seeing as I just came back from camp. This also explains why I've been on the computer so much, I missed that too! I also had to catch up with my friends, so my&nbsp;days have been pretty full, except for today... So I'm finally done gathering all the pictures of Paul I can get although I still need kid pictures of him, which I can't find anywhere...but whatever... I QUIT!! Anywho, I gotta go...
