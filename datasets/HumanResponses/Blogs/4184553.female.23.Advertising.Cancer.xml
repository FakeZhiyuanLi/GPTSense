       when i was in college, tuesday was "wine night".  every illini knows of wine night.  it is common knowledge that wine night is held at clybourne, where at 9pm they begin serving a pale pinkish Boone's Farm quality (if not the real thing) wine that gives you heartburn after a few sips.  but it is cheap, at $4 a bottle, and it is loved by all who grace the champaign-urbana community.  (well, by those in the age range of 18-23).     what is tuesday in the real world?  nothing happens on tuesday.  all the men and women who reside in my office building are going home tonight to watch the olympics, or watch tuesday night television/reruns, and the adventurous ones might be going to meet a friend for dinner.  i mean, i guess it wouldn't be too hard to find something interesting to do on a tuesday.  this is new york after all.  still, we can no longer gallavant around at all hours on a tuesday like we did in college.  we can't decide to blow off work, like we did class, and expect it to go unnoticed.     so with a tear i say goodbye to my power to control my own schedule with the flick of my alarm.  i have to accept the imposed structure and expectations of outsiders now as my own.  ugh.   at least i'm getting paid for it.

       i hate mondays.  i have been through countless mondays at this point in my life.  they are always the same, i always know what to expect, yet monday morning never fails in finding me groggy and crabby and resentful that the weekend is over.  i usually snap out of it toward the afternoon, but until then i find myself looking around my desk, searching all the tacked up pieces of paper in my cubicle as if the phone lists, project schedules and creative briefs will give me some kind of clue as to what the hell i should be doing.    alright- i need coffee like a junky so i'm postponing the rest of my blog until later on.    one last thing though.  To X:  i'm sorry you felt ambushed by my posting.  i'm sorry you felt set up.  i guess i didn't tell you because i didn't know if you cared.  or i was scared that you might not care.  but i appreciate that you called, because i think it is clear that the only reason i would still remember the emotions that i felt then and the experience of feeling hurt is because it mattered.  you were important to me, and it was hard on me to see things change.   i didn't write it to sideline you in a passive-aggressive way, and i didn't write it so i would get something out of it.  but i ended up getting some feedback- and that was a bonus.  so all of you out there, if you ever meet a darling boy named "X", he's alright.

       i've decided to out an ex of mine.   he is a platonic ex.  who is already very much 'out'.     i moved to new york on february 1st, after my brief three month residence last summer.  i was starting over: moving out here alone, and thanks to my internship employer's great tendency to recruit people from all over the country, none of my friends were here when i came back.  they had gone home and decided they did not need any more from this city.  i had one friend left here, however, and he was, i thought, a pretty good one.   we'll call him X.     i was instantly attracted to the fact that X was much more personal, and personable, than most new yorkers.  we spent a fair amout of time together last summer.  we always had a great time together, and our friendship became solidified when, while i was back in Champaign-Urbana finishing my last semester at college, we spoke quite frequently.  he even came to my graduation.  needless to say, i was happy that we would be reunited when i came back to the city.  he appeared to be looking forward to it as well.     suddenly, he started fading out and being fairly unavailable.  he told me that he was busy putting a lot of effort in to "making more gay friends".  eventually i realized that this meant he had less and less time for me (a very heterosexual female).     on march 13th a very close family and childhood friend of mine died in a terrible accident.  i called X and he came over and spent the day with me.  this was a great favor, as i was far from good company that day- laying around like a zombie, crying and chain smoking.  two days later i left new york for a week to go be with the family and friends for a while to deal with the accident.     X called me a few times to give me support and make sure that i was okay.  i thought maybe we were back on track.  maybe our lack of contact was merely a phase, and things would return to normal.    i flew back to new york on march 25.  i never saw X again.  i felt used.  i felt betrayed.  i felt like he was a fraud.  was he faking it all that time when we were 'great friends'?  i had no idea that it was possible to be dumped like that by someone you're not sleeping with.   i mean, what  was  that?   i have recently started talking to him a little bit again- via typing.  it is completely impersonal, superficial, and akward to talk to someone in that way that you used to confide in.  my wise and trustworthy friend says i am stupid to "start things up again with him" (see what other words of wit and wisdom he has to offer at  urlLink http://bojanglesrompingroom.blogspot.com ).     not to worry, there will be no starting things up again.  it is highly unlikely that X and i will ever talk about things beyond the conversation that one would be willing to have with a perfect stranger.  in the end i guess he didn't really fail me.  i guess i just imposed qualities on him from my friends who are better than good.  i know better now, no one will ever be blake and jason.   i guess it was my fault.  i just overestimated this new yorker.  but for a while, he did put on a more convincing act than the rest.

       so about ten minutes ago i finally woke up, after staring at my computer screen for an hour and a half here,  and realized that today is...dun dun dun...friday the 13th!!  insert: blood-curdling scream now i'm not superstitious or anything (maybe a little) but the past 12 hours have been a bit plagued.  it all started around 12:30 this morning.  i was having a hell of a time falling asleep.  for one, the weather is weird- for all of you out there without air-conditioning (everyone who lives below 14th street)- did you notice that it was chilly enough for a blanket, yet so damned humid i was soaked with sweat.  additionally, there seemed to be some kind of disagreement happening down on usually serene commerce street.  i picked up on this due to the exchanged screams of the people down on the street- reaching levels powerful enough that in my in-and-out of half-sleep made me repeatedly jerk awake thinking that they were in fact  inside  my room.  props to them and their vocal cords, because i live on the fifth floor. finally, after falling asleep around 1:45am i awake to violent burning and itching of my hands, feet and under my chin combined with a racing heart.  now while this initially sounds like i was experiencing heart failure, a seasoned veteran like me knows that this is just an allergic reaction.    the most annoying part of these attacks is not necessarily the symptoms themselves, rather that i have no clue as to what caused it, or what to stay away from, as i am allergic to, oh, just about everything.  i will not pretend that this is something new and different for me.  since i have quit cold-turkey taking my every 12 hours prescription allergy medicine i have experienced many more intense allery episodes- my body is on its own and defenseless to the outside world.  i'm considering life in a bubble.  luckily, the elite community of yard-owners in new york is miniscule, and the yards consist mainly of 2' by 1' patches of fenced in grass built in to the sidewalk, so my allergy attacks sprung on by grass cutting day have been greatly reduced.  one thing to cross off the infinite and ever-changing list on the enemies of my immune system. anyway, i better sign off.  i need to find some food for this hungry black cat under my desk.

      on august 25th my alma mater will resume classes, and i still have not accepted the fact that i will not be attending the new school year.  school has been a permanent fixture in my life thus far.  it has been my foundation, often the only thing that provided life with regularity- mentally and physically.  i have been living in new york city for seven months, and i still feel like i am on vacation.  i graduated last december.  it wasn't all that recent.  while i know, old habits die hard...err, habits?  bad phrasing.  the school frame of mind is embedded in my psyche.  i can't break out.  i wonder when i will grow out of the craving for papers and deadlines, libraries and books (and the simultaneous dread for all these things).  sooner or later i will have to accept the fact that my destiny now is in health benefits and memos and meetings.  from now on i get to contribute what i have learned in the past 23 years, but others will no longer demand that i broaden the spectrum.  that is up to me.  from here on out, i have to teach myself.
