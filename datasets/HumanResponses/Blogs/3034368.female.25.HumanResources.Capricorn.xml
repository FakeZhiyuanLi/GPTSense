      I just shouldn't smoke pot. I feel like I have...shit, what does Michael J Fox have again..? that. On the metro ride home from work tonight I thought a lot about how much I hate the human race. I also pretended that the grease stain on the track was in fact blood from the last person who jumped in front of the train. Apparently that happens here quite a bit. From the number of people sleeping in the metro stations I wouldn't doubt it. When the trains go by you as they're coming into the station this warm breeze blows over you. Sometimes I like to get really close to the train and look in at the people, all the while thinking about how easy it would be to just fall over, whack your head on the side of the moving train and fucking die. Other times I'm actually happy, and I stay away from the edge of the platform and fantasize about fucking my boyfriend while I stare blankly at the tracks with a sleazy grin on my face. It's been 3 weeks now. I'm gonna start humping the sofa arm really soon. MYTH: Everyone in Montreal is hot. ( I know you've heard this one) FACT: There's LOTS of hot girls, not really too many hot guys. Seriously. AND I've seen way too many people sporting capes in this city.  Capes!     Halifax is full of hot people, and they all seem to hang out with eachother. I've been at parties where I found myself flirting with everyone I spoke to. damn. Oh, sorry about the wrist slitter that was my last entry. OOOHhhh, but just one quick 'fact' about Paxil and I'll never mention depression again.... -When I was on Paxil I would black out a lot. One time I was walking up South St. on my way home from work, I was on the corner of Robie, and I fucking blacked out. I came out of it sitting on the curb with my head in my hands, and all I could focus on was the birds chirping in the trees. No traffic, no people, just the sweet sound of little birds in the trees. holy fuck. Speaking of bad trips, I once took 3 hits of some retarded acid and saw double for a good 2 hours. I made it home just in time for the whole "room melting" sequence, so I masturbated to distract myself and ended up having the most intense fucking retarded orgasm ever. I wish they were always that good.

      I've got a pebble imbedded in the palm of my hand from when i fell on my ass last night. I was trying to kick some guy that had been following Ali and I home, and the fucking dick grabbed my foot mid air. This gave Ali the opportunity to punch him in the face, and the pussy went running. It's smart to run away when Ali's fists start flying. She gave me a black eye 3 summers ago, a really big & bad one too. We were in Liverpool (hick town on the south shore of NS) for Privateer Days (celebrating the beginnings of this shithole inbred sanctuary with people in 1800's wear and a big ass beer tent in a parking lot). Dirty dancing with other girls in the beer tent is an absolute MUST if you want to have the true Livey-pool experience-it really doesn't take much to piss the skids off, but any seemingly homosexual act is the instant negative attention getter. (more about that later) So, after the beer tent we (Ali, Kristen, Crystal and I) start beating each other up: in the park, in front of the post office, on the lawn in front of town hall...this is when the cops pull up, then another, so we head towards Kris' house-we've lost Crystal at this point to KC, who repeatedly asked us to make out while we fought. I decide that I really, really want a black eye, cuz I've never had one before. Without hesitation Kris swings at me and punches me in the ear, which makes me spin around and fall on my ass. No black eye. I move on to Ali for help, but she's reluctant. I start tapping her on the side of the head, saying over and over, "hit me, Ali, hit me." I slap a little too hard, the rage, SMACK!!! i vaguely recall running around screaming, then passing out on the floor. There's a great picture of me out there holding a bag of frozen peas to my face. Not a single redneck chick tried to fuck with me for the rest of my time there, guess they thought I was tough or something. When I got back to Halifax the eye was at that perfect purple stage. I worked at the Mokka at the time, so I got this about a million times: "oh my god! what happened to your eye!!!" yep. My favourite reply to that was, "well, my boyfriend hits me sometimes..." Fucking take your coffee and mind your business.  Ahhh, the Mokka. I miss that place.  I'm a fucking idiot. It's 330 in the morning, and I'm just now feeling recovered from my hangover from last night. I haven't really wanted to smoke all day, but now I reaaaallly want a cigarette and of course I don't have any. So, is it worth it to walk down to crack city (ontario st. east, village, crack) in the middle of the night, on a friday, by myself, for a pack of smokes??? is it worth it I ask. Of course it is! More about last night. We went to some bar for the 3$, 3 bands, 3$ beer night. Ran into a girl from Halifax (they're everywhere) so she joins our table, bringing with her a really annoying 'gotta get laid' guy. I turn around to look at the table behind me just as a guy starts puking into his beer pitcher, his friends catching the perfect shot on their digital camera. They were laughing their asses off at the poor fucker, so we joined in. After he filled the pitcher he passed out for a bit (he has our full attention at this point), which allows his friends to continue taking photos of him; the high point was definitely when they poured the puke into a glass and tried to make him drink it. I've been thinking about writing a message in the Mirror asking for some of those photos to be sent to me. Laughing at other people's misery definitley makes you feel better about yourself. The annoying guy thought that his best bet at getting laid was to challenge me to a drinking contest, after his compliment "wow, I really dig the way you girls drink." (huh) fell short of the mark. After discussing it with the girls in the bathroom (we met a new girl there and invited her along) we decided to take his free beer, but when we got back to the table he was gone. Damn.   From there we went to a very cheesy bar called Tokyo, full of ugly boys and hoochies. Excellent make fun of people opportunity. I tried to pick some guy's pocket but was laughing too hard and he grabbed my arm. For the rest of the night we all took turns trying to steal his cell phone out of his back pocket. I think that he hated it. As we were leaving the bar I grabbed a guy's wallet, he let me, and took his Visa card out before giving the wallet back. Beth had to make me give it back to him.

      I was a big winner at slutty bingo last night. I won passes to two different shows. yeah, i rule. The photos should be posted soon on the killhimhidethebody website, so keep checking the link. It was the perfect event for the very first Montreal version of Ladies Nite, featuring me, Ali, Beth, Sandy, and Sandra. We met in the park with our 40's and wine stubbies (yes! wine stubbies!), and discussed opening an S & M hotel & a pretty friend service (yes, basically an escort service, but the idea is to gain attention from the ladies b/c you're surrounded by hot chicks. guys with hot chicks around them are 100 times more attractive). We also got to witness some guy climb a tree and then hang upside down from a branch. Perhaps he thought that he was a squirrel. Who knows. Oh, we also talked about how annoying some of the bums are here. They don't just ask for money, they kick you, grab your tits, spit on you, and beat you with an umbrella while screaming "fuck you China!". It's getting out of hand, really.  I made a new friend at slut bingo, Maia, and we will be going to one of the shows together as we had to split the prize. She was the one handing out obscene amounts of lube to people. I got the free lube and the free condoms, now I just have to get laid. ha. which will happen never. The Habs better win Thursday night, cuz I have to work in the middle of where the riots will happen if they lose and I don't want to be sweeping up broken glass. So, go Canadiens, or else!!

      The cops called me at home 6 times yesterday. I wrote two statements, in regards to my co-worker and myself being mauled by the same man. I go to court next week to testify.  It's good to see the cops actually doing something about shit like this. A few years ago I was grabbed on the Commons, but I fought him off and called the cops right away and gave them a perfect description of the guy. They asked, "Did he say anything to you?"  "No, be he had his arms around my neck."  "Well, if he didn't say anything to you we can't do anything about it."  Say what?!? Dealing with cops just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

      Last week I was mauled by some nut on the street. Little bit o' titty grabbing action. Today he was in the back of a squad car, charged with sexual harassment.  HA! It was my boss' wife that brought the charges upon him, I never bother calling the cops anymore, but I felt like a little justice was passed my way. In other sketch bag news, I was totally duped last night, taken for money. It'll take too long to write about, and I don't really feel like re-inacting it, but my cash ended up being 35$ short. Best boss of the year award goes to my boss, Somal, for not making me pay it back. He really is the best, too, so laid back and understanding about everything. My first shift we sat and drank coffee and smoked cigarettes together. Today he let me sit down for half and hour so that I could chat with a boy. He  insisted.  It has already been 18 degrees outside and the trees are full of buds. C'mon summer, I'm ready for you.

      Yea for bikes! I spent the evening at Right To Move, a place full of bike scraps where they help you rebuild or fix up - you guessed it- a bike. I picked out my clunker and for 3 hours worked on it, learned a lot, got really frustrated, and left full of grease and feeling pretty damn excited. There's still lots to do, but I now know how to re-install brakes.  It's so nice to finally have my own bedroom. I can't believe that Ali let me sleep in her bed with her for a month! I'm going to spend the rest of my night in there, working on my little project. Good night!

      Hockey, hockey, hockey. I watched "the game" on a big screen.  Best: yelling "sit down!" at everyone, even if no one was standing.  Worst: The hot & way too young boy disappeared while we were talking about politics. We totally deserved it. Haven't really been in the mood to write..

      St. Laurent was lined with hooting, hollering, horn blowing hockey fans. It was a good indication of how retarded this Saturday night in Montreal was going to be.  We didn't leave the house until about 130, arrived at the pub to find Dave wasted and two girls making out at the bar. I don't remember if somebody told us that the girls were from Conneticut or if we just started saying that they were, but very quickly Beth's lie was spread around the bar as fact. "Did you know that Conneticut has the highest rate of STD's in all of the U.S.A?" A guy later told us he knew for a fact that neither girl was wearing underwear because he had fingered them both.  We ended up at a party, things are a little fuzzy at this point. I remember dancing with a guy and yelling at him for being a lousy dancer while I'm slopping beer down his shoulder, and I remember Dave dragging me into the bathroom to show me the bloody pad on the floor. "Girls aren't supposed to do gross shit like that! Ewwwwww!"   And suddenly the sun's coming up and everyone's taking turns beating eachother with some stick as we run down the street, then we're eating onion rings and smoked meat sandwiches at a diner, I've switched jackets with some guy and the cuffs stop just below his elbows.  I ended the night laying on my bedroom floor trying to get my boots off. Drunks just shouldn't own 15 hole boots.

      Me and Vin de Quealite Certifee sat out on the patio today after work. My patio. I have my own bedroom now and a patio and it is so lovely.  I wanted to decorate my new room but all I have is weird pictures of cowboys and now Im drunk and noone is home forever and I am just lonely as a motherfucker.  I borrowed old cd's from my roommate. I was instantly transformed into my 15 year old self and all songs were about my life and i remembered how I thought that Jay Mascus (?) was the coolest shit ever. Ohhh, I used to listen to music, press pause so that I could write down all of the lyrics because they all meant so much to me. Now when I get songs in my head it's always the music, can never remember any lyrics. iget that civil war part in my head on the bus all the time by motorhead. oh but what the lyrics are is civil war, civil war, civil war. dahhh dahh dah dah dahh.   dinosaur jr.  was my favourite and smashing pumpkins and dead kennedys was somehting that kc carved into the tourist bureau steps. I also went through a retarded U2 obsession but now they're suck so much. but fuck they did some good stuff. today the perverted business men that always harass me at work asked if i was a lesbian. they said that they wanted me to be theirs and i said nobody fucking owns me and they're like ohhh do like girls then? noooo, just no body owns me. oh but i want you to own me. arhhghtg. blah blahjhbn girls are so nice to sleep with but i couldn't date one. they're crazy, you know. im trying to edit myself here hreally i am.  so the first girl i slept with was 8 years older, i was 20 and she was a dancer from montreal and came into the mokka all week after rehearsal. one night she grabbed me at the marquee and demanded that i come to her show the next night. i was fucking stunned because i had never been come onto by a girl before and she was hot. so i went, she was mostly naked throughout the entire thing, we made out at the marquee afterwards and then i spent the night in her hotel room.  girls are so damn intimidating though. it's easier to just make out with your friends.    im really loaded so somebody come home already and entertain me. i had a really shitty week because im in the middle of a break up more or less. no not a break up, just an unknown thing that neither of us want to deal with and we love eachother but we're bad for eachother's motivation. blah blah blah. that pathetic write up about wanting to know what people thought of me. oh fuck im so see through sometimes it makes me sick. attention! attention!! ahhhhhh rockabilly tonight so enough of not going out all week. i am getting ready. somebody want to come over and dance to the cramps with me? im waiting.

      Okay, I'm self-absorbed. I had a really long conversation with someone that I had just met the other night, and the thought I kept coming back to was, "I want to know what this person thinks of me."  When you first meet someone, no, see someone, and it's before you know that you'll ever actually talk to the person, you start making judgements of what they're all about. They're wearing that shirt, so that means that they're into this. And so on. Of course, that person has to catch your attention in the first place. Some people can just float around and never be noticed. It happens. SO, someone catches your attention. They're hot, or they're yelling loudly, or they walk into your work place and you have to serve them coffee. First thought??? What am I putting out there? I really don't know. The other day in the Mirror someone complained about girls who dye their hair black. Sorry, white girls that dye their hair black. "Are you trying to tell me that you're all hardcore or something? "  White girl who dyes her hair black here.  They also wondered why we don't smile. (we meaning me and other girls who..oh you know what i mean) Soooo, I thought about that later on and decided to make a real effort to smile as I walked down the street. I don't think that I'm much of a scowler in the first place, more of a squinter ( i need glasses). So I started to smile. Not a big toothy grin or anything, just a simple smile. Maybe I'm thinking about puppy dogs or some shit. Nice stuff.  And holy shit, everyone starts smiling back at me!  How nice. I liked it.  I watched a movie about this Peakar guy tonight, a comic book writer. It's funny, they said his first name throughout the entire movie and all of a sudden I can't remember it. Help me out here, Mark. American Splendor. He gets cancer, and his wife decides to make an animated novel about it.  She thinks that it'll help remove him from the experience. i'm taking signs from everywhere I can get it lately.  I've been reading about the lives of people that I know, thought that I knew, knew from seeing them around. In any journal that I've ever kept I wrote with the thought that someone else was going to read it. Maybe because I used to read my sister's journal, or because my first boyfriend read mine while I was in the bathroom. Why wouldn't I think that here, considering that millions of people have access to the internet and all?  (Beth had to point that fact out to me, by the way. Really, anyone can just read this shit? People get obsessive and find that you've posted your street address and will want to come to your house? Well, maybe, so I erased it. ) I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. I haven't been sleeping very well lately.  I want your first impressions. If you know me, and you can remember it, tell me about you first impression of me. And an after thought. I'll return the favour.

      Could it be?? Spring? really?  Today was one of those days where it just felt so good to be alone. I pretended to be looking for a job, but really I just walked around, crossing the street so as to always be on the sunshine-y side, my mind wandered, I let a boy talk me up for a while, then gave him the wrong phone number, a solo pic nic in the park, window shopping...I'm already a damn slow walker, but today I made an extra effort to really drag those feet.   Now to make the day complete, I would like to go see some great bands and dance my ass off. Ideally Straight 8 would be playing, but of course this is just not possible, so I'll have to find an alternative. I haven't seen a good live band in a very long time. I've seen a few shows here but they've all been kind of disappointing, or by the time we get to the bar the band we've come to see is over. Saw an all girl band but they were so goddamn...girly! Ooooh, play that quirky pop, girls! yeah.  I was pretty lucky to be the weekend bartender at the Khyber, as I got to see lots of bands. Lots of crap, mind you, but sometimes it just rocked. The only downs to working good shows were: a) watching your friends get really loaded and have a blast while you're cold sober and changing their ashtrays b) having to do crowd control when it's someone you know, and they've just pulled the plumbing apart from the urinal, or have just gone through the window.  Okay, I'm starting to feel kind of lonely now. I'm trying really hard not to think about it, but every thought I have leads back to the same thing. I did the most mature thing in my entire life 2 nights ago-I let go of someone that I was madly in love with so that we could both try to make something of our lives. Meaning: Instead of giving him a guilt trip for not moving here with me, I told him to move to Toronto so that he could go further with his career. I also chose not to follow him to Toronto because that's just not where I want or need to be. Wow. I mean, I love this boy, we've been together for 2 years. I just need to start doing things for myself. Aaaah. Grrrrrr. rrrrrrr blah blaaahhhhhh. Being mature sucks shit.

      I've spent the entire day laughing at myself. It started when I woke up on the couch, clothes still on, my first thought being, "oh fuck did I really do that?"  Luckily everybody else was just as fucked up and hopefully will not remember.  Things took a turn for the worse right about the time we snorted lines in the kitchen. A few things I'm too embarrased to repeat later, Beth and I are slow dancing to metal and babbling on about how much we love each other. oh and I'm hitting on her.  I settled for rubbing my face against her for about an hour. It was 6am and the dance party was in full swing when the cops showed up.  We stumbled home, trying to bum smokes off of strangers. one guy tried to talk us up but all Ali and I could say was, " Hhaallliffax " in response to his questions.  Ali and I dragged ourselves to a diner for some breakfast at 7pm, then roamed around to walk off the fish and chips. I don't think we stopped laughing once. We're both really homesick and have been talking about Halifax all day. OOhhhh I miss it. I've moved around quite a bit in my life. Winnipeg, Thompson, Geary (shit hole redneck population of 200 village in NB), Liverpool, Digby, Halifax, St. John's, now Montreal. When people ask me where I'm from I never really know what to say, but it was almost always either Liverpool or Halifax. I definitely feel like Halifax is where I'm from. I drove myself nuts trying to get out of Halifax, I was getting antsy after 6 years, but once I left it I realized how nice it was. And there's so many awesome people there. Fuck, I was just telling Beth last night that I wasn't planning to go back, but fuck if I'm not thinking about it. Not right now anyways. I'll be moving into my own room next weekend (finally! I've been sleeping in Ali's bed for 3 weeks!) and the lease is until July, and of course I want to be here for the summer! Oh but the lakes and the ocean in NS, and all of the bbq parties... No, I'm just homesick, and I'm loving this city. I'm just thinking more about how I could just finish my degree through King's and get right into the sign language course and actually do something with my life. I guess I came here to fuck off for a while, have fun and figure out what I want to do. Well, anyways, we'll see.  I've been reading blogs by some people in Halifax. Okay, I'm fucking addicted to this blog thing. That's kind of satisfying~feeding the homesick thing. I read an ex-boyfriend's blog and found myself mentioned (oh my god did I really do that? I emailed you???), so in return I want to recount some of my fondest memories of our time together. Shit, it's more like the funniest stuff he's done. -He pretended to be retarded, just after we had had sex. We'd been watching the Idiots. He even threw an Of Mice and Men reference in there.  -On our second date we went to the Graywood  -no, first we went to the SMU bar, where he drank 7 vodka & limes in about 5 minutes. There was a really shitty band playing, and when they introduced their next song as being about shooting yourself or something he yelled out, "my father shot himself!" then yelled it again after the song. The jocks at the next table didn't appreciate it, especially after we made fun of one of them for not wearing socks, and my boyfriend pretended to hit on one of them while sitting on my lap. Next thing you know there's 10 frat boys waiting for him outside of the only exit. Apparently one of their friends had shot himself in the head.  -He changed my answering machine message so that it said, "So & so's pizza shop and abortion clinic-your loss is our sauce." My uptight roommate's mom was the first to leave a message.  I think that I should really call him.

      It's metal mike's birthday -which means there's a big party and im gonna go, even though i decided yesterday that i wasn't going to drink for a while because i drink too much. guess that's out the window...for now. maybe i'll take a break tommorow... why are we all drunk all the time? why do i think that it's a good idea to drink supreme 40's (that's the 8% one, 3,45$ a pop oh yes), and why did liam think that it was a good idea to eat the slime that the 'body part' came in? it said non-toxic on the container, but c'mon. anyways it was funny, i gagged quite a bit, but i took pictures and im sure they'll be entertaining to look at once developed. so why are we all drunk all the time? email me and tell me what your reasons are. mareseat_oats@hotmail.com  10 years ago, when i was 15, I thought a lot about what i'd be doing in ten years...which is now...let me tell you, I'm nowhere near the mark. I wanted to be an artist, be in a band, be smokin' hot, and be really happy. something like that. I used to be in a band. It was a great band. Now Ali and I put our tape on and rock out to it, sing along and laugh about how our guitarist used to spit on the audience. crystal is rock and roll. I gave up on the whole artist thing when i realized that i just wasn't that artistic. I ended up studying linguistics in University, but never finished the degree even though i only have 3 credits left. I do really want to go back and finish, hopefully I can do that at McGill if i ever get off my ass and do something about it. As for being hot, well, I think that I stopped going through my ugly faze about 3 years ago, which lasted since i was about 7. Man, was i ever ugly! People thought that i was a boy until i was about 12, then i kind of played wing man to my hot friends for a long time. "So, where's that cute friend of yours..." THEN I decided to like the way I looked, fucked too many people in the excitement of it all, got over myself a bit...discovering yourself is a lot of fun, but you usually act like a total dick.  Am I happy? Not really, but I'm getting there. I just need to get over a few things, drown my sorrows for a bit, figure out why things happen if they do in fact happen for a reason. Well, I should get ready to go out. I'm gonna try really hard not to drink too much tonight. Maybe I'll just get an 'extreme' 40 (7%). yea, trying really hard. Cheers me dears.

      Uh, yeah, Sorry about the last entry. I shouldn't be allowed to use the internet when I'm drunk. I'm such a sap, jee wizz.  Here was the rest of my weekend:  There was a wedding reception on Saturday night at Casa del Popolo, 1$ beer for christsakes. I felt a little bad crashing the party, but I did know half of the people there so it wasn't like I was a total stranger. As soon as I got there the bride was throwing the bouquet, and I was pushed onto the floor. I didn't want to catch it b/c then I'd be the girl that the bride didn't know who caught her coveted 'you're next' bouquet.  So, of course, it hits me right in the head. What do you think that means??? I spent the next hour silently pondering that question, a little overwhelmed by the party going on around me. I wore  urlLink DRock 's sunglasses for a while which helped make things seem even more like a movie. I got drunk. I danced. I got so much beer dumped on me that I rung my hair out and a river of booze went down my back. I ate (wrapped) candies off the floor from the pinatas that had been smashed open with bar stools and fists. I tripped over the stage and went flying, and when a guy leaned over to help me up he fell over on top of me. When I finally got up off the ground I realized that everyone that was out on the patio was watching and laughing. I traded a "I'm a lover not a fighter" pin for a "Drink, Fight, Fuck" pin. I piggy backed Ali part of the way home and had a debate with her and 'Drew about belief systems. It was a good night. Sunday I worked at Meow with Rebecca. We made tons and tons of t-shirts, drank coffee and smoked cigarettes. Our music choices for the day was a mix between Supersuckers and Hawaiian music. Man, this job kicks ass. Seriously. I came home and made the best pizza ever, and went DVD crazy. I watched Reservoir Dogs, Summer of Sam and Kill Bill. My ass became one with the sofa.  Today I intended to get things done (whatever that means), but I've come to discover that today is a holiday, and that the student loan centre, the bank and McGill are all closed. Wicked. I'm so pissed at myself for leaving everything to the last minute; now it's all piled up and I have one less day to get shit done.  This weekend coming up will be filled with more fun. A guest from Ontario will be staying with me, the  urlLink Heelwalkers  are playing a show, I have my  urlLink court date  on Saturday morning,(well, that's not fun), the bike courier rally is Saturday night (I'm one of the volunteers. Couriers from all over will be here. Bikers stop at my post and I get them to do a test. Then I get drunk with them and flirt my ass off.). And so on.  I'm glad that I chose to stay here. Ever since I made a decision everything seems to make a little more sense. And the fun just won't stop.

      Another Halifax reunion tonight and I cant spell but Slitch played and it was so nice to see them. I even kissed DRock on the lips. but now im home because im so so tired from working a double shift and being drunk. Im listening to the Slitch CD that I now own. Im thinking about all of the wonderful people in Halifax that I love, especially the people that I've never told. the people's blogs that i read all of the time, the people that i saw constantantly in halifax but didnt spend enough time talking to, its weird because i was in such an intense relationship and making friends was difficult. but there are a lot of people that i really like and i cant wait to see them this summmer so that i can tell them how wonderful they are. Im feeling so loving and lonely and i wish so much that i had someone to lay my head upon and weep for how beautiful and sad life can be.

      I did it. I pushed the SUBMIT button. I have now officially applied for the PR programme at McGill. Oh me oh my. I've been floating around on-line for about 2 hours now. I don't know how people can do this all day, all the time! So far I've read everyone's blogs, checked my e-mail 4 times, and laughed at my University records - in my 2nd year I had a GPA of 1.32 during my winter term, which then went up to 3.46 the very next term! The idea of being back in school is both  exciting  and  unnerving .   exciting -I will get to use my brain again...is good ting cuz got no left all go down wit beer. ummmmmm, beer.  unnerving -I will have to use my brain again! Oh my god, I think it may be permanently stuck on 'auto pilot'!  exciting -Receiving student loan money is a beautiful thing. They don't actually think that I'll ever have enough money to pay it back, do they?   unnerving -Student loan money only covers the booze fund and some of your text books. You gotta keep the shitty part time job to cover the tuition thing.  exciting -Boys, Boys, Boys! (to the tune of Girls, Girls, Girls by Motley Crue)  unnerving -I will hear "wow! you're that old?" from those damn 18 yr. old boys that I'll be hitting on.  exciting -Student discounts!   unnerving -Once I'm a student again Visa will definitely allow me to renew my credit card.  In other news.....I got a new job!! I've been hired at Meow, a clothing store that specializes in t-shirt transfers, retro clothes..you know, cool trendy stuff. This is all thanks to Ali, who works there as their silk screener extraordinaire, and suggested me to them. Now all I have to do is quit my other stupid fucking job and I'll be all set. No more coffee slinging for me. At least for now. Please say forever. But probably just for now.  In  other  news.....well, let's just say, if this blog was more annonymous I would tell, but....it's not. So I won't.

      I've just spent the last half hour linking around, trying to find out what happened in Halifax.  She was someone that I saw all the time. I've spoken to her quite a few times. I thought that she wanted to sleep with Craig so I started to dislike her.  Such pettiness. There's nothing I can do now. You don't get to take anything back. Our lives are cut and paste of heart breaking images and sounds. And then...

      Don't go see Troy. No, really. Just don't. If you really want to see Brad Pitt naked, and I assume that's the only real reason that anyone would go to see this movie, just go flip through the new Vanity Fair. As far as Orlando Bloom goes, he looked so faggy in this movie that I didn't even find it attractive, and for me a little fagginess is like a pre-requisite for being my boyfriend. Okay, I admit to sleeping through about 85% of the movie, but I was baked out of my mind after eating weed brownies. What can you do?

      My new roommate Sebastien just called me!  On July 1st I'll be moving in with 3 new people, all UQAM students. They seem pretty cool, very nice at least. It will be an adventure living with total strangers, french ones at that. The place is really cute, right in the middle of the plateau, beautiful courtyard that's perfect for summer days & nights, and it's only 300$ a month all included. And it's just down the street from Beth. We'll be streetmates! So, Sebastien called to confirm that they want me to be their new roomie, and that I should come over and hang out sometime. That's really nice. Very exciting. I'm going to see Troy tonight with a fun crew. I just know that it's gonna suck, but goddmnit Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom are fucking hot. And I love dill pickle flavoured popcorn. So, it's worth it.

      I just knew that something stupid was going to happen. We all knew. Will stupid things continue to happen? Probably. No, most definitely. Will I choose to stay out of it? Although I can't stand these dramas, I would have to say....go team go.  Like a pack of wolves... I moved to Montreal to get away from Halifax, but it has followed me here!!! EVERY DAY I see somebody from Halifax (ali and beth not included). Every fucking day. There's one guy that I totally forgot existed, haven't seen him in years, and yet I saw him twice in one day! And I don't want to see him! I do see a lot of people that I really like from Halifax, but now it's just starting to feel weird.  Last night at a roof top party it was about 80% Halifax blood. I shit you not. Thus, with the presence of Halifax comes the drama. Arg. I tried to rid myself of the frustration by playing  glassball  (I used my empty 40 as the bat, Jordan pitched the brick), but ended up getting yelled at  by a guy from Halifax .  I love you Halifax, there will always be a place for you in my heart, but please, leave me alone. I'm with Montreal now.

      I woke up this morning and proceeded to immediately involve myself in a yelling match with my best friend/roommate. I was actually still in bed half asleep when it started. Since then I've been trying to shake this feeling of anxiety and frustration, although I don't think that drinking a full pot of extra-strong coffee is helping that at all.  I just called a potential new roommate, to set up a 'personal evaluation' meeting. Unfortunately the person who answered the phone spoke entirely in french, the pot. roommate was in the shower, so I mumbled something like,"um, okay, je retournai le, uh, telephone..??.. dans, uh, veingt minutes???" Fuck. When I say things like that I just hate myself. It's so frustrating, especially when I had a very articulate conversation with someone in french just last night. So I'm going to 'return the telephone' in  20 min., just enough time to sit here and worry about it. It was Liam's birthday yesterday. We met him at the metro stop armed with balloons w/ skull & cross bones drawn on them, beer, a pin that read "eat shit" and pictures of 'his girls' taken in the photo booth just moments before. We met up with a few others in Park Lafontaine and laid in the grass drinking beer. We stayed there until the cops came, at which time I decided to dump an entire beer down the back of me while trying to conceal it. We took the party to my balcony, where we watched Ian's dog get molested by my roommate's very horny and deprived dog. (I can kind of relate.) I have the day off, so I guess I'll be out walking the beat today, = searching for employment and trying hard not to spend money that I don't have on things that I oh-so want.

      Okay, good advice so far, but I'm still lost. Everyday something happens that veers me towards a different decision. I sent Craig a nice love letter package today, so suddenly I don't miss him as much, or really it just feels easier to deal with for now. I was also told by a second person today that I should go into public relations, which would involve taking a one year programme here in Montreal. But, I also had another bad interview today, which involved the potential boss totally putting me on the spot by turning off the music and saying, "okay, start speaking in French." Argh, you asshole! So of course I ummmmed and awwwed like a fucking retard. Then he said, "Um, thanks. We'll call you." FUCK!!!! No you won't. I know that I could learn French if I really tried, and I know that I'm having trouble allowing myself to settle in here, and I'm not looking hard enough for a job. I think that, like a lot of people, I'm TERRIFIED of doing something with my life. I'm so afraid of taking that step into adulthood, the world of responsibilities and (fairly) clean living. Sometimes I feel like going back to the comfort zone of Halifax is a total cop out, other times I feel like it would be the best for me because it's definite and solid and I could definitely get something done there.  Toronto, I must say, really isn't too much of an option. I know that I would only be following someone there, and as much as I love him I know that I would instantly resent him and blame any unhappiness on him wanting to actually live in Toronto. I know why he wants to go there, he feels that it would be the best thing for his career. I would never consider moving to that city other than to follow my boy around like a lovesick idiot. So, really, Toronto is off the table. As much as I love him, I know that I have to do things for myself first. FUCK, my head is in the blender. Speaking of blenders, my grade 7 guidance counselor told me that Autistic people see the world "like when you turn the blender on and the TV goes all fuzzy." What a fucking idiot, but anyways. This is a lead into the next topic, which is: Fucked up people. Weirdos. Crazies. ( Some may have a problem with me saying that Autism = crazy, but fuck you, it's just a tie in. ) So in the Mirror's Best of Montreal they have the top 10 'weirdos' listed. No surprises seeing "the black guy who sticks people up with a banana" at the top of the list. He's awesome. You should give him all of your money. A true disappointment was seeing "the guy who screams at people in front of LaSalle" only at number 5. He in fact stands directly in front of the cafe I work at, and it is a fucking riot watching him in action. He totally deserved at least a bronze in this category. Tonight I sat down for a smoke with one of the regulars and we just laughed our asses off at the poor people walking by. We noticed that he ALWAYS yells at girls, rarely at guys, and always at Chinese people.  This has inspired me to write my own top 10, but c'mon, just say it like it is, Top 10 Crazy people. Just so you know, the top 5 all hail from Liverpool. In case you need to be schooled in Liverpudlian lore, check out brian the ling's link, and definitely try to find the Liverpool Encyclopedia link. I can't think of the domain right now but I'll find it. A quick google search will probably send you on your way.  1.  Alan Frasier . Anyone who has lived in Liverpool or knows someone from Liverpool knows who this guy is. Apparently he's a genius, but did too much acid, got into a bad car accident and now thinks that he is the giver of 'pink iron'. He has had battles with Satan, has slept with the woman who invented sinks (?), and knows personally the person who invented a time travel machine out of water. Yes, this person used the time machine to travel back to a Led Zeppelin concert, then got up on stage and played one of their songs  before they had even written it . whoa. He actually told me that story, and many others, while I was on acid one night. That explains a lot right there. He also made an appearance at one of our high school parties, where he threw up in his hands, ate it, then took off his pants and walked around in his saggy 2 month old briefs. Ah, Alan Frasier. 2.  Hacksaw.  My former nemesis. Tall, skinny, hands blackened from smoking 10 billion rollies a day. He would hang out at the KFC with his best friend, Charlie (don't worry, he's coming up), where they'd hang out together talking jibberish and hiding shovels on eachother (?). One night I was walking home, in a really bad mood, and Hacksaw was standing in front of KFC, staring at me. Me: "What the fuck are you staring at?" Hacksaw: "Nothin' much, darlin. Nothin' much." What a burn. Beth's mom claims that his name derives from his many nights spent in jail, where he'd always demand a hacksaw in a pie in order to cut himself outta there. He died a few years ago, apparently on the toilet. Isn't that how the best of them go? 3.  Vanilla Kid . The raunchiest little firecracker to stroll Main St. She was the chick that hooked up with all of the Liverpool crazies, including Hacksaw, Charlie, and the Child Molester (he's coming up, too). She was always in a rush to get somewhere, one arm swinging to and fro at her side. Don't get in her way! One night Hayes egged her on a little too much, and the next thing you knew she was trying to get a little group action going on with some of my friends...but first she had to pee...piss ran down the sidewalk as about 10 teenagers ran for their lives. 4. Charlie . "Hi. Hi. Go home. Go home. Naw." That about sums up his vocabulary. He was great at making hand gestures, though, which usually involved a finger going through a joined thumb and pointer.  5. The Child Molester . He's deaf and dumb, but no one ever wanted to believe that. I was witness to the court case where he got off on molesting 2 pre-teen girls because he couldn't understand the charges. Waving your hands on top of your head=Moosehead, please.  6. Jennifer . Oh what a sorry, sorry sight. Anorexic, totally fucking nuts, cross-eyed Jennifer. She would come into the Second Cup every day when I worked there and just go on and on, with her tales of near drownings in the tub and 'strange poos'. My co-workers and I would take turns standing in front of her while she talked, although she never noticed the changing of the guard. 7. Dancin' Mike . Fuck, he should be higher up on the list. Oh well. I made the mistake of dancing with him at the Marquee one Retro Night, I didn't even think that he had noticed me he was so into his routine. But, he noticed, and I became his dancing queen. Once he tried to appologize to me for some gross gesture or another, and the friends that I was with pushed for me to let him hug me. Next thing you know he's suctioned to my neck and, goddamit, I felt his lips there for days afterwards. 8. Deaf note passer guy . I can't remember his name right now, used to know it. He would galavant down Barrington or Spring Garden, waving notes in people's faces that asked for money. With his money he would come to the Khyber and get shit faced, letting out a throaty "Whoooo. Huuuuuhhh" every 2 minutes.  I was eventually assigned the unfortunate duty of writing him the "you're barred" note.  9. Gordie Roach . He deserves a higher ranking on the list too, but he's more of a living legend than a crazy anyhow. He lived at the Khyber, demanded free coffee, and would have animated conversations with Dwight Yokam and Hank Williams while pacing back and forth in front of the bar. It took me a long time to warm up to the bastard, but how could you not love him after watching him spend 5 hours on a gig poster, complete with rope style lettering and lassoos? 10. PJ . Remember the El Strato on Gottingen? It burned down a few years ago, which is a fucking shame because it was a truly beautiful dive. Anyways, PJ hung out there a lot. He was always willing to heal you with a scalp massage, although he spent most of his time standing in front of the 'cowboys killing the indians' mural, shaking his head in dismay. Whoo, that's enough writing for me tonight. Please write out your own 'favourite crazies' list and post them on your blog. They're deserving of your time.

      Okay kiddies, time to make a decision for me. I'm stuck and I just don't know what to do anymore. This decision can and will affect the rest of my life, so choose wisely.  Should I... a-stay in Montreal and have fun.  b-go back to Halifax and finish school in order to stop being a dead beat loser.  c-move to Toronto to be with the boy that I love.  I wake up every day feeling differently about things, one idea seems better than the others depending upon my mood, what's going on, etc. For a while Toronto wasn't even really an option b/c I didn't want to just follow Craig around, I should get my life together just like what he's trying to do...but oh god I miss him so much and I just don't think that there's anyone out there that's as wonderful as he is and I want to be with him! I know that I need to go back to school, I just can't work loser jobs any longer and the sign language course that I want to take is in Halifax. That town can be so suffocating and boring, but I also feel like it's my home. Montreal is a fucking blast and there's tons of stuff to do, but I can't get a good-shitty job because I don't speak french well enough. I've only lived here for 2 months so I don't really know if I could feel at home here yet.  So? What do I do? Hurry up and make a decision for me because I should start making plans and all. Okay?

      Yes, I was a cranky ass earlier today. That all changed when I happened upon the box full of "free stuff" on the side of the road! Oooooh, I love free stuff. I now own a pad of coloured construction paper, 3 packs of crayons, a bag o' safety pins, a curling iron (excellent hallowe'en tool) and an art fag mag. Whoo! Ali and Jora (who is visiting from Halifaxe) forced me out of the house on our bikes, and we met up with Beth, who made my day even better when she bought me a big ass iced mokka. How could I stay grumpy? We were a little biker chick gang, cruising through some of the most beautiful neighbourhoods in Montreal. THEN I discovered a corner store that sells bottles of beer for a buck each! Ummmmhmmmm. Now I am being rushed to get ready, as we're going to see some Rockabilly goodness tonight.  Not a bad day afterall...

      Our apartment is almost completely empty, save for the piles of dust and dirt that had once hidden behind the furniture, the mountain of stinking recycling taking over the kitchen, and the small black and white TV that sits proudly in the middle of the empty living room. Last night,after helping Ali pack, (I don`t own anything so no worries for me) her and I sat cross-legged in front of our little primitive set with a beer and fretted over the state of the world`s affairs.  It was the nicest thing I`ve done in a while.

      I just took a nap and had the worst dreams. One was a really gory view of Jean Charest having the top of his head bitten off by an aligator. Then Jean turned into Paul Martin, who then turned into Brian Mulroney. They all got their heads bitten off. (voter anxiety, perhaps?)  The other dream was a memory of something that happened last night, of me walking with Beth, Erin and Liam into the show. The cute boy leaning against the wall was even there. I was going up the steps...but the steps never ended, I just kept going up them, just the view of my feet taking steps. Then the steps started moving like an escalator, which was taking me higher and higher into the sky. It felt like it got hotter and hotter the higher I went. Then suddenly I heard a voice say, "Don't fall back!", at which time the steps started slanting backwards until they were almost completely vertical.  I woke up feeling anxious, if you could believe it.

      Well, nothing can ruin your mood more than having someone laugh at you. No, actually, having 3 bitchy, catty, dumbass bitches dressed like whores for the Darkness show laugh at you could definitely top it.  You can initially be in the best mood ever, like how you'd feel after watching the Suicide Girls take their clothes off, while you drink beer with some of your closest friends, and you've just run down the street trying to grab people with the 'double claw' with one of your best friends while sceaming "we got no brakes! hey!". But then the bitches just open the flood gates, and suddenly you get quiet and start thinking about things, and you feel awkward in conversations so you just kind of stand back and watch people talk, drinking the whole while, and suddenly you're really drunk and crying at the bar and all of your friends pity you and now you've put a damper on their night because they had to watch their friend be pathetic. Today I'm worrying about how I may have scared a really nice boy off. Oh well, he's probably better off. I don't know if there's any romantic love left in me. Still, it would be nice if he called... Someone is standing in front of our house, playing the tambourine quite horribly. I think that I'm gonna go look for something to throw at him.

      Last night I celebrated my re-decision to stay in Montreal by doing what every good resident of Montreal does: get a lap dance! For 10 bucks I got to go to "The Heat Zone", watch  urlLink Laura  get a lap dance, who then watched me get one...AND I got to touch her fake tits! (The stripper's, not Laura's.) (um, and Laura has real tits. But I didn't touch them.) Today I feel as though my eyes are bleeding, but what else could you expect from a weekend of drinking with Irish and Nova Scotia folks?

      Aahhh...quiet. Can you hea...jesus! Just as I wrote that the phone rang. Okay, let's try that again. Jesus! The phone again! Okay, okay. Please, don't ring again. Great. So, as I was saying, this is the first bit of quiet I've had all weekend, and it's lovely. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep last night, only to get up at 630am to work at the cafe, then on to Meow for yet another shift. Phew!  When I got home the house was still; the visitors are checking out Old Montreal and the graveyard, Arlo hasn't been around all weekend, and Marco...well, sadly, Marco moved out yesterday and his room is completely empty. I'm really going to miss that crazy Sicilian. :( It's been a fantastic weekend, though. Unfortunately I'm too damn tired to write about it right now. I must go lie down for a bit, because I have a feeling that the weekend isn't over quite yet.  For the weekend.  I am so serious.

      The number of people living at my house will jump from 6 to 11 this weekend. Whoever requested a  urlLink party  just got it.  Once again I would like to know why there are so few hot guys in Montreal. I mean, c'mon! And the ones that are hot are hanging out with these impossibly hot chicks. Such torment. Speaking of hot chicks, my boss asked me if I "did chicks" today. I got pretty flustered at first, I just don't want to be talking about my sex life with my boss, but then I figured that the only way to feel okay with the situation is to just be honest. "Yeah, I like girls, but I'd never date one. They are, after all, only good for one thing.."

      I tried to watch  urlLink Pirates of the Caribbean  with my roommate last night, but it was just too...well...it was just too damn embarassing! Movies like that cannot be watched in the company of boys, it's just wrong.  (Some of you may think that the movie itself is just plain wrong, but then again you must just be a boy and you wouldn't understand. Or you hate the  urlLink Disney  Company.hmm.) *i used the word  just  5 times in that one paragraph. As one English prof. I know would say,  yeeeech .*

      Out of bed, throw on the firt shirt and skirt I see, off to the kitchen to make coffee.  I don't want to talk to anyone, and I sure as hell don't want anyone to see me.   Bzzzzzz, bzzzzzzzzz   (that's the front door) I was expecting a roommate who had locked themselves out. Instead it was a lawyer, delivering me a subpoena. His suit looked really nice.

       I made a half assed, last minute escape attempt this evening, but then decided that I really just couldn't afford to spend $200 on a 2 day 'vacation' in Peterborough, Ont. No, shall we say, dice.  I have the next 2 days off and would really like to do something nice. Maybe... *A trip up to the mountain.(after living here for over 3 months it's about time.)  *A nice bike ride through Mile End and Little Italy. *A trip to Chinatown for some cheap groceries and one of those weird puffy peanut ball thingies. *Coffee on Beth's back deck. *Suntanning in Park Lafontaine.  Oh, yes....

      The beautiful  urlLink Cherry Bombed  arrived in town on Saturday, so of course we had to go out and get royaly shit faced. The night began with 4 pitchers at the Biftek, followed by a bottle of wine in crack head park, my favourite of course. The presence of a crazy man with a broken hockey stick put us in the mood for a bit of heckling. We tried in vain to get boys to take their pants off for us, but no one was willing to do it unless we followed suit. It seemed as though the boys were on to us, almost like they knew that we only wanted to laugh at them, so once the wine was gone we got up to leave...I blindly reach into what I think is my plastic bag (my purse of choice lately)...and stick my hand into...  fuck what the hell is this?!?  pink liquid, most likely puke.  Oh God!!!  I scream...and guess who comes to my rescue? God! God being the crazy man with the hockey stick, who comes running to me yelling,  You called? I'll be your God! Heyyyyyyy..Blah, Blah ! We run from the park, me with the tainted hand held out in front of me like a claw the entire way. We had to get through the masses of drunks on St. Laurent, which gave me time to wipe my hand on a few people that I pass.  You want some of this, don't you?  I purred to one of my victims, who responds with a  Oh yessss.  We make it to the bar, where we dance our asses off to some rock and roll retro. At around 4am we plow back down St. Laurent, abusing more drunks with wedgies, frantic humping and cat calls. A bouncer is waving his glass of water in the air while he talks, so I swipe it from him as I breeze by and continue on. We arrive at Beth's house and proceed to make asses of ourselves in front of her boyfriend's co-workers, who had been hanging out on the back patio, trying to relax after a night of putting up with assholes like us. We finally find our ultimate victim, someone more than willing to take his pants off for us. Except he doesn't stop at the pants, and the next thing you know he's in his tightie whities and slurring at me  C'mon, lets do it. Let's just do it.   This lead to me beating him off of me with his own belt, which led to me nearly falling off the patio, which lead to me now having a huge purple and black bruise on my ass,which led to the guy getting angry and spitting on Beth's hand, which led to Beth dumping every drink she could get her hands upon onto him, as well as the wax out of the candle...and now I'm the proud new owner of his belt.

      Home. It's a word I've been thinking a lot about lately.   I was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the day that I was born was the day that my parents sold their house. I came out upside down and jaundice, and I was almost named January. We moved to Thompson, Manitoba, and I spent the first 10 years of my life on Riverside Drive, in a house that was white with blue trim, 2 storeys plus a basement. When it rained a giant puddle would form at the bottom of the driveway, and I would sit in it with my rubber duckie and pick the tiny christmas trees out from between the cracked cement. My neighbourhood was the woods across the street where the wolves lived, the cul-de-sac up the street where all of the best Hallowe'en candy came from, and the school parking lot a block away where I peed my pants because I couldn't pull myself away from the rainbow that had formed in the sky above me. My second home was the public library, where my mom worked. Books were the best babysitters that I've ever had, by far. An hour's drive outside of town was the dump, which was, in my opinion, the funnest place to be in Manitoba. It was the free zoo; you had the beavers building dams on the side of the road, the raccoons and skunks that darted out in front of the car, and the rulers of the heap, the black bears, that scavenged for food amongst the rubble. Every summer we would drive the flat and torturously boring 8 hours down to Winnipeg, and the only thing that would save me from the torture of my two older sisters was to count the bales of hay that lined the fields and pretend that they were buffalo. When I was 10 my parents decided to go back to the place where they had met, and where my papa, aunts, uncles and cousins all lived-New Brunswick. They all lived in Oromocto, about a half an hour outside of Fredericton. But that wasn't where we were going, not exactly. We moved into a house another 20 or so minutes away, in a God-forsaken, skidoo trail settlement called Geary. I mean in the woods, middle of nowhere, you have no neighbours within a 5 minute walk from you kind of place. I knew that things were going to be rough for me when I discovered that about 160 of the 200 people living there all had the same last name. I somehow managed to get through grades 5, 6 & 7 living in that place. I started out reading every and any book that I could get my hands upon, quickly discovered the art of shoplifting, and shortly thereafter the never-come-out-of-your-room-again escape of masturbation. I couldn't really talk about the latter act with anyone, but I did eventually meet a few like-minded kleptomaniacs, a couple of other girls that were ousted from the crowd because we got our periods way too early and had mouths bigger than the size of the sorry excuse for a town that we lived in. My sisters had their troubles adjusting to their new surroundings as well. The middle sister started listening to "18 and Life" by Skid Row over and over in her room, and, from what I read in her diary, was having sex with her boyfriend on our front lawn. The oldest sister got pregnant and at 16 had a baby, my nephew, who's now almost 13 years old and is the coolest kid on earth.  The end of grade 7 came and time to move once again, this time to Liverpool, Nova Scotia. By this time I was an accomplished shoplifter and practiced liar, and I was determined to use these skills to move quickly up the social ladder in this new town. I spent my first month there watching Terminator 2 over and over again, fantasizing over Edward Furlong who played the role of the young John Connor. The house that we moved into was old and full of secrets and ghosts. I started sleepwalking again. The spirit that occupied the attic wanted to tell me something, and she would pass through my room at night on her way back up from her roaming, possibly through the sealed up stairway that lead from the kitchen to the closet in my parents' room. Eventually I was befriended by the worst possible type of people, a group of girls that were not unlike the pack of wolves that had terrorized the neighbourhood dogs back in Thompson. These wolves wanted 'new girl' blood, preferably an eager to please, smack dab in the middle of their ugly phase type of new girl. Me. A year later we moved up the street to Murphy Drive, to the housing projects. My life changed dramatically when I discovered that you could quite easily sneak out of my bedroom window, for soon I was roaming the streets at all hours of the night, 14 years old, getting drunk with the sketchiest of people. I don't really like remembering those times. Towards the end of grade 9 I made friends with Ali, then KC. Ali was a cool girl and hung out with high school kids and went to parties put on by University students, and KC started telling me about music that didn't suck. By grade 11 I had a big group of friends and finally felt like I belonged somewhere. I felt at home.   So what do my parents go and do? They move to Digby. Fucking Digby home of the goddamn scallops, Nova Scotia. Just in time for my grade 12 year, my last year of high school,  the year that you're supposed to graduate with your best friends and go to the prom and get really loaded at a cabin party when your parents think that you're at safe grad.   Fuck, I'm tired. End of part one. You'll have to wait until my next post for the rest of it.

      It's Thursday night and I'm still not sure if I've fully recovered from last weekend.  Here's the rundown of&nbsp; 'birthday' weekend: Friday night I went to a strip club with my coffee shop co-workers, in lieu of&nbsp; someone's birthday.&nbsp; Dear readers, we found  the  strip club to put all others to shame.&nbsp; I got 2 dances, paid for by the company; and really it wasn't a dance, it was a 10 minute makeout fest with a naked girl.&nbsp; The timid little hippie co-worker ended up half naked on stage with 2 girls, and the birthday boy was stripped down to his boxers-the announcer saved us all from him becoming completely naked by reminding the girls of the laws against it. Saturday night I danced my ass off at the Bloodshot Bill show, very reminiscent of the Straight 8 Deluxe dancing days. The Meow girls were introduced to the Halifax boys, and I knew that they would all become perfect friends when they all broke into singing Judas Priest together. It was a beautiful moment.&nbsp; Beth and I decided that this would be the night that we would try to break the boy, by sitting on his lap and yelling vulgar nothings into his ear.&nbsp; Silly girls, it was us that got broken in the end, and I have the bruises on my legs from falling through the window, on top of her, to prove it.&nbsp; I ended up walking home at 430 am, cursing the fact that I had to work at 8am.  The next day was to be Ali's official weiners and girlie drinks birthday bbq, but everyone was hurting big time, and the hostess of the party couldn't pull herself from the face down position longer than the time it took to let out the occasional "arrrrrrggggggguhhhhhhhhh".&nbsp; But, we were determined, the party must go on, and so after a few hair of the dog blender specials we were off to the kareoke bar.&nbsp; Since we were the only ones there we decided to hit the staff with wall to wall badly sung hits, complete with dancing and group singing.  When I woke up on Monday I decided that this next week would be detox week, for sure. Im getting kicked off now. Until later....

      I'm back!&nbsp; And yes, it's been so long due to both lack of access and pure fucking laziness.  Speaking of being back, I'll be back in Nover Scotier in a week! I land in the afternoon of the 3rd, so get yer wallets and livers ready, kids! I expect free drinks and someone to make out with (this means you, Crystal.) &nbsp;( The make out part, I mean. But you can buy me drinks, too.)  Things I want to do while in NS:  -see my friend get Brian get married. holy shit, that's just so weird.  -swim in the ocean.  -get heckled by some neckers in liverpool.  -go swimming at Tea Bag lake. I love jumping off that rock.  -sit on Citadel Hill with some pretty ladies, maybe have a few drinks there.  -see all of the wonderful people that I miss and love.  -avoid the Khyber building, at all cost.  -have Crystal serve me an ice cream cone and sell me a pack of smokes.  -see a rock show.  There's some other stuff I want to do,&nbsp; but it's beautiful outside and I have some birthday stuff to attend to.  I'll try to write again soon, but perhaps the next time you hear from me I'll be yelling in your ear at the Seahorse. Until then...   ps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you titt, for your guest appearance.  pps&nbsp; Brian, if you really want to be a guest, too, email me and i'll give you the codes.

      She asked me to be a 'guest' writer, though I would have prefered to be a 'ghost' writer.&nbsp; Then I suppose I would also have to give credit to someone else and I chose to be no other than the Cherry Bomber.&nbsp; Miss JanAss is unable to easily access a computer as to post an update of her life (or she's too fuckin lazy and is making me do it...) so she's making me do it.&nbsp; And since I don't know what the hell she's doing because i'm a 13 hour car ride away, I'll consider her longingly... After months of transition and breaking the protective notion of a relationship, tenative decisions and many advice seeking e-mails, six weeks of debauchery and drunken ruin, she has decided to remain living in Montreal for her health and her sex life.&nbsp; And I was convinced by the end of my french course, not wanting to leave the endless cruising around town on bicycles and drinking in parks, rock shows and strange parties, that I should decide the same fate for myself, if for no better reason (though there are many) than to learn french. No one doubles you on her bicycle seat while drunk&nbsp;on draught better than her.&nbsp; To feel secure balance on a seat stuck up your crotch, teetering side to side brushing traffic and worming through parked and moving cars (Montreal drivers at that) at 4am lets you know who your friends are.&nbsp; If there is only one pillow on the bed, she'll give it to you.&nbsp; If you have only one beer in the fridge, and your not around, she'll likely drink it, especially if it is a Guiness.&nbsp; I was still drunk on one hour sleep when I frantically packed up my bag to catch my ride back home and forgot to say goodbye.&nbsp; But she found the photo of myself&nbsp;I tacked on her wall beside her mirror when she woke up and felt that was just as well, despite the fact I randomly put it there a couple days before hand and she just hadn't noticed.&nbsp;  I think i'd do better as a ghost writer.&nbsp; Perhaps i'll grow my armpit hair.&nbsp; Is arm pit one word or two?

      I no longer have easy access to a computer (heh, heh, easy access), so for the next while my posts are going to be pretty infrequent. Unfortunately my memory is only long term, so maybe in about 5 years I`ll remember all of what I`ve been up to this past week.  Meanwhile I`ll write about the bits that I do remember. I now live in Mile End, definitely the nicest neighbourhood I`ve seen in Montreal so far. Our neighbour is an eighty year-old Portuguese woman. A very talkative little lady, but seeing as she only speaks in Portuguese I can do little more than smile, nod, and offer a few words in French and Spanish, to which she smiles, nods and continues in Portuguese. Around the corner from our house you can get fresh bagels, 2 samosas for 1$, the best coffee in Montreal, and a serenade from the man playing the organ in front of a restaurant. A little further down the street you will find the most fucked up, sketchy- in-a-good-way bar, and you will not be surprised to discover that Mariah works there. I met some very interesting people there, and even though they think that my name is Kim and they didn`t believe me when I said that I`d be back, I`ll definitely be stopping in again soon. Now we just need to get a phone... I don`t know how I got through this weekend. Besides moving between the hours of 10pm and 3am, working two doubles in a row and going out every night, I still managed to stay out until 6am last night and get up at 11:30am to go to work. The only side effects have been: the inability to maintain balance for more than 30 seconds, bouts of epic yawns, seeing tracers and having the overwhelming urge to curl up in a ball in the middle of the store and tell people to make their own damn shirts. Tommorow I`m modeling for a photo shoot of the new clothes line, and after that I have to go yell at my old boss about why I should get paid for the work I did over a month ago. If I have any sunshine time left after that I think I`ll go find a park to pass out in. Now I`m going to go bike around my neighbourhood and hope that I run into my bike gang. The best coffee in Montreal is definitely in order.

      What a stupid night. This just proves to me, once and for all, that drinking makes everything ugly. We become so consumed by the fun that we're having that we forget about other people's emotions. Even if you think that what you're doing is innocent horseplay, others can and will see it as you being a full on asshole. Jesus, what's the point of talking around a subject when it's too personal to write about here anyhow? It's eating away at me, but this just isn't the place for it. To get my mind off of it I'll try thinking about how lovely my Friday night was. Ummmm...yes. Go to a happy place. I forgot about that feeling you can get, when your heart is flopping around in your chest and eye contact makes you blush... Shit, this is really personal, too. Can't I write about anything?
