      Ha! Maybe that snappy title will spark the interest of the lock step ideologies who support the most evil administration ever to be in the whitewash.  That's right you amoeba brained boneheads!  I wrote this just for you so I can enjoy making your blood boil....Rush is a Drug addict, Donald Rumsfeld is a Sado-Masochist, George Bush is a simple minded puppet, Fox news is really Faux news, Bill O'Reilly is a LIAR, and Condoleeza Skeeza Rice has blow job lips.    Okay enough ranting about how much I hate Bush, now I will rant about how much I can't stand the white trash that live across the street in  low income housing.  Of course they have little American flags strung up all over the place, although for the life of me I can't understand why they are so patriotic considering most Republicans would like to have them all sterilized so that they would stop reproducing.  There is one who weighs about 500 lbs and has to use a walker just to get around because she has gotten too fat to even walk.  She has 7 kids, and the youngest is 4, I wonder who on earth slept with her?

      It's humid today and I feel like a sweaty over-weight housewife chained to a never-ending cycle of baby chores, laundry, moping, dishes, cooking, making beds, cleaning out toilets, emptying litter boxes, etc...On top of that is our 110 year old Victorian that is turning into a nightmare to renovate.   We should have just moved into an air conditioned storage unit.  I never want to live in a handyman special again.  Just imagine, we had to pay over half a million in New York for a fixer-upper.

      The antipathy I feel for George W.Bush is consuming me.  It simply amazes me that anyone would support such a horrible and inept president.  What really baffles me are the people who vote against their own economic interests i.e. working class people who definitely do not make 200,000 dollars a year.  A typical example of this type of person is my sister in law.  Her husband makes about 30,000 dollars working for the post office in NYC.  They have to live way outside the city because they couldn't possibly afford to live near the city with what he makes.  They have lousy insurance coverage, they have to shop at thrift shops, they never go anywhere because they are so strapped....Yet they vote for George Bush.  Do they really think George W. Bush, a man that was raised with servants and mansions cares about them?  I once tried to tell them that Bush never even owned a ranch until Carl Rove made him buy one right before the 2000 election to make him look like a "regular guy".  People like my brother and sister in law are hopeless cases, they will vote for "W" no matter what because the only news they watch is Fox News, the official mouthpiece of the Bush banana Republic.   I believe history is not going to be very kind to George.  What kind of legacy will he leave?  Under his leadership the worst terrorist attack  this country has ever seen occurred(he ignored the warnings and consequently 3000 people died)  he cut taxes for the ultra wealthy, he cut funding for education, he destroyed our international reputation by pre-emptively going to war in Iraq on manufactured evidence, the armed forces under his command has been torturing and raping Iraqis, the list goes on and on, and I am going to breathe one huge sigh of relief when this jerk is voted out of office, that is of course if the elections aren't rigged by Diebold.
