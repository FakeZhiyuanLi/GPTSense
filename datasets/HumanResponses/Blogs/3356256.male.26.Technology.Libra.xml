      Dear Mr *********,    I know that mistakes and computer failures are bound to happen (I work in the field).  I also understand that this is not your fault and in no form am I blaming you.  However, I have been trying to resolve this issue since January 17, 2004.  To avoid any further confusion I will explain the problem.     The LCD on my laptop cracked and that was the reason it was sent to the depot. On February 24, 2004 I was informed that the broken screen was not covered under warranty and that I would have to pay for the replacement of the LCD.  I was not thrilled but I wanted the screen replaced and placed the order.  That same day I checked my email and the order placed was for a 15.4" LCD when it should have been a 16.1".  I called once again and they canceled the order for the 15.4" LCD and placed the order for the 16.1" LCD, which is what I had on the laptop to begin with.  A few days later, I received a call from Customer Service to inform me that the order wasn't placed because they needed my payment information.  Once again I provided this information and received the following order #******.  I have recently received another order #****** via email; followed by an email stating that it would take 4 to 6 weeks for my laptop to be shipped out.     This would be the third time that I have been asked to provide my billing information. Two months have passed since my laptop arrived at the depot; however,my laptop has not been repaired nor the part ordered.     Prior to my purchase I had heard many good things about Alienware but to be honest I have been disappointed. I expected quality service from such a well reputed company and that is not what I received.   I will call customer service as you have advised and provide the information need to get this issue resolved.  I hope this can be resolved as soon as possible. Thank you     23 day's later I received my laptop!! Well I did learn a few things: 1) If you ever have 3k to spend on a laptop you might as well go away on a nice vacation with the money. 2) Get a friend who works or use to work as customer service to make the calls.  They'll most likely get the issue solved faster. 3) Never get a 3 year warranty that doesn't cover any parts 4)Never buy from Alienware  You have been warned.

        Yet another week at work, oh joy!  To sysadmin or not to sysadmin that is the question of the week.  I've gather some info from the rumor mill and it appears that the sysadmin group will be one person short.  Does that mean that they will be looking for another sysadmin?  Could it be that they will hire another worthless  insultant  (consultant)?  Who knows?  I've really wanted to join that group for quite some time but  never have been lucky enought.  You would think that by know I would have left and found a sysadmin position somewhere else but I haven't.  Hopefully they'll get someone internally and hopefully that means me...    On the anime front, I'm really looking forward to watching  urlLink Samurai 7  which is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's classic " urlLink Shichinin no samurai " aka Seven Samurai. Gonzo Digianimation will be animating this series which means that it's going to be great.  Last Exile, Gantz, Peace Maker Kurogane, Chrono Crusade and Zaion where all made by Gonzo Digianimation and they were all great.  From what I've heard, they will be taking a different twist on Samurai 7.  Samurai's in space?   I'll just have to see how that works.

        Well, it's been quit a boring day, which isn't always bad to say when I'm at work.  I've pretty much sat around all night watching some anime and smoking up a storm.  Well at least it's my last evening here at work... I really do miss having a "normal" life.  It's been 4 years since I've started working the graveyard shift and it's starting to get to me. To the point that I'm alway's tired.  My friends know that the moment I sit on their couch I pass out and then it's quite hard to  wake me up.  I really need to leave this place!!!

      It’s been quite some time since I’ve posted anything new on this blog.  I’ve already received a treat from Craig that he will remove my blog from his links.  Considering that he’s the only person reading this pathetic blog I’ve decided to appease him by updating my blog.   Laziness just breeds more laziness!  For the past couple of months, I’ve been stuck in one of these lazy streaks where I’m lucky to even make it to work.  Well summer is here and I need to start getting out of the house and actually enjoy the weather.  This weekend was one of those weeks where I actually got out and did something for a change.   Saturday, I went out to Jason’s house to play some eq out in the backyard while having some drinks. Yesterday, I went out to the beach and had a really great time.  Let’s just hope I can continue to enjoy this summer.
