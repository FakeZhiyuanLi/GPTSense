      One year ago today I started working with my company.  They gave me a keychain to commemorate the event.  Pretty impressive, huh?!?

      Yesterday after work I stopped by the mall on the way home.  This new guy I am interested in works at Nordstrom, which is very bad for two reasons.  First, Nordstrom is my weakness. I love the store.  I don't need any excuse to go in a drop my money like a 20 lb brick.  Actually giving me a reason to go there is really bad.  Secondly, it is on my way home from work, so I can't avoid going by and thinking, "I bet he is at work, and my wardrobe could use a little infusion."  Anyway, he wasn't at work, and this time I actually asked someone if he was there.  I am such a nerd and kind of afraid that I am a scary stalker girl.  Must get my head back on body and let him come to me.    Went out with Marie for dinner at Naked Fish.  The salmon was actually not bad, even though I live in a landlocked state.  The only kind of annoying thing was that we opted to sit outside on the patio and the when the breeze blew through the trees little bits of nasty nature fell into our plates.  Kind of gross, but c'est la vie.   Afterward I went with Marie to her church services.  She goes to first Presbyterian in Boulder.  The speaker made some really interesting points and pretty much all of her talk could have been given over the pulpit at my church, so I was fairly comfortable.  After the lesson, everyone got up and was mingling and talking.  I didn't know anybody and it felt like the first time you show up at a singles ward.  You're just standing around looking for anybody to talk to you and be nice.  Luckily, a few people did so I felt alright about that.  On the plus side, there was a far denser population of good looking boys in her church. That's always nice.    It started to rain pretty hard so we decided to skip the traditional trek to coldstone and I came home.  On my way home I talked to this kid named Ryan on the phone. I invited him to go camping with my crew for the weekend.  After finding out more details about the trip he decided not to come, which was a bummer, but the whole phone conversation really pumped me up.  I was actually funny and interesting on the phone, and we talked for almost 15 minutes, which is really good for me since I hate talking the phone. Anyway, he practically asked me out for sometime next week.  Stay posted for more info.   Also, my death crush from 5 years ago called me up to talk.  I didn't get the phone, but he left a message.  It was nice to hear his voice. I like talking to people from the past because it reminds me of how much I have grown up and improved.  Lastly, I called up my good friend Alan and convinced him to come camping with us this weekend. He hurt his knee, so he was considering not coming.  Then, I reminded him that 1) we won't be doing any backpacking so there won't be two packs for him to carry and 2) he is going with me and I don’t really DO strenuous physical activity. I am really excited for him to meet all my friends and be social because sometimes I worry he is just sitting down there in New Mexico going to work every day, riding his dirt bike every evening and going to bed without having talked to a single person all day.  Yikes.    So all this male attention is making me feel normal again.  It is really hard for me to not have it since the last two years at BYU I was surrounded by guys and although it was all just platonic (except for Derek of course) I still miss having those kinds of friendships.

      I accidentally erased your comment. I meant to erase one of Michele's because she commented twice, but I clicked the wrong entry. I don't want you to think I don’t want you to comment, because I do. I LOVE it when people comment.

      Once again, the foul odor of cornuts is permeating the air I have to breathe. How can people enjoy eating those nasty little pieces of putrescence?  I am considering turning this blog into an anti-cornuts awareness website where I lobby for the governmental ban on the production and consumption of this seemingly innocuous afternoon snack.

      So last night was FHE, again.  I went, again.  None of my normal circle of friends from the whole past year went.  I started getting frustrated because I didn't understand the mentality of just sitting around and not going.  I had a really good time with the people that were there, even though they weren't my "closest" friends.  Once again I realized the importance of being a "joiner."  You miss so much in life if you think you are "too cool" for things.  Almost anything can be fun if you show up with a positive attitude.  I learned this from one of my greatest friends, Derek. I think this is an important quality, and one I value in others.    I spent a lot of time with this guy last night, and I think I feel the beginnings of a crush forming, which is exciting.  Last night was the first time I didn't have one dream about my ex-boyfriend, and when I woke up in the morning I didn't think of him at all until I realized that I hadn't thought about him.  It is true that finding another distraction helps you get over the previous one.  Anyway, I think I am going to start a full out assault on this kid and see what happens.  Wow, that sounds really scary.  By "full out assault" I mean I'll call him up some time and see if we can hang out.  I'm so aggressive.  Anyway, another interesting thing that happened to me yesterday: I was just sitting in my nice little cubical and all of this sudden this stranger came in.  He said, "I know this may be a little forward, but would you be interested in having lunch with me some time this week? Tuesday or Thursday works best for me."  I was really surprised and said sure, for Thursday.  I'm really excited because stuff like this hardly ever happens to me.  Plus, I'm always up for meeting new people.  It is kind of hard for me to meet people outside of my church.  It is just so easy to let church people be my entire social world.  I need to remember to branch out and find other people who have my same interests.  I need to not be socially lazy so much and be a little more proactive.   So tonight my friend Marie and I are going out to dinner at a new restaurant on Pearl called Naked Fish.  I'm way excited because I haven't been able to hang out with her in FOREVER and she is one of the coolest chicks I know here.    This is my schedule for the day (just so all of you who aren't in corporate America understand how dumb working is)  7:30 arrive at work and begin checking email, reading friend's blogs, writing my own blog  8:20 make myself some hot chocolate and go talk to my co-worker about how dumb the software that we use is.  9:00 go to a mandatory meeting about Export control.  I will probably spend the time during this meeting looking around to see if there is anyone cute in the whole auditorium, followed by a hour of trying not to doze off.  11:00 drive up to Boulder for my monthly group meeting  11:30 lunch and group meeting (I haven't gone to one of these in the year I've worked with the company were I didn't doze a little)    1:30 get back to my cubical and check my email again, and my voice mail.  Probably spend the next 30 minutes answering the questions left on my machine.  2:00 meet with the guy who stood me up for the meeting yesterday to talk about design requirements for a heat exchanger I'm designing.  3:00 get started on my heat exchanger  4:00 check my email again, check my phone again, fill out my time card  4:30 go home.  All in all I got paid for 8 hours of work, but actually I only did 1 hour.  Pretty impressive, huh.

      Today two people, who I hardly get to talk to ever but I miss terribly, told me that they follow this thing every day.  I had no idea they were interested in my exploits.  Just for an ego boost for me, and for some information, why don't you take a minute to sign the guestbook and show me that you're reading.  Thanks so much!  (make sure to notice that my mom signed my book.  At least she thinks I'm cool)

      Where to start...  The interview.  I showed up a little early just to be on the safe side.  I sat outside of the conference room getting a more and more nervous.  Ten minutes after 3 this guy came up to me and showed me in.  There were supposed to be 3 guys interviewing me, but only one showed up at first.  He sat me down and talked to me for 45 minutes about the work they do. I was somewhat interested.  Then, a second guy came in.  The first guy left and the second guy repeated what the first guy had said almost word for word.  After that experience I don't think I want the job because it sounds like a life sentence.  Once I get in there and got trained I would never be able to leave or try something else.  I'm just too new to engineering to limit my options and experiences like that.  Plus, this morning I was talking to my friend Lenny and he made it seem like taking that job would be a really big mistake.  He knew two other people who were being interviewed for the position and they are all experienced and know what they are doing.  I was kind of flattered to be lumped into a group with those other people.  Lenny said that there might be a job for me working with him on his program, so I'm going to feel that option out.  Friday morning we packed up and took off for Durango.  The drive down was pretty exciting.  We almost got Sarah to pee behind a building.  That is one thing that kind of drives me nuts.  People who have to pee every hour on road trips.  Luckily, this time we didn't really have a deadline to get to where we were going, so it didn't really bother me.  Durango is the most beautiful place yet I've seen in Colorado.  Well, maybe a tie with Granby.  The mountains are all around and it was so green from all the rain we've been having.  Friday evening we walked around by Amy's cabin and then made hot dogs over the fire. All 5 of us tried to sleep in one bed, but in the middle of the night I gave up and moved over to the couch.  I need to be able to feel like I can move in the night.    Saturday we got up, ate WAY to much breakfast, and took off on a hike.  It started to hail while we were hiking and the hail was really sticky, so instead of bouncing off like normal hail, it stuck to everything and got us really wet.  We almost missed the coolest waterfall because it wasn't next to the trail.  On our way out we were walking at the same level as the water and about 5 minutes later we saw it about 100 ft below us.  Sarah realized that there must have been a fall somewhere, so we left the trail, slid down a hill and walked up the river.  We finally saw the fall in the distance and called back for everyone to follow us.  Finding the waterfall made the trip worth the drive for me.  It was SO cool (photos to come). Also on the way back, Sarah had to pee, so she let the group go ahead.  There was a little tree bent over the path, and she decided to hurtle over it while running so she could catch up.  Well, because she was focused on the obstacle in front of her, she tripped on a root and completely face planted on the path.  She wasn't hurt, except for a couple of banged up knees.  We made interesting life analogies about looking too far ahead and missing the important things in the present. We are nerds.   After we got back from the hike we went to Purgatory (a ski resort, not a Dante location) to see if we could ride the alpine slide.  Because of bad weather, they had closed the lift, but to our surprise there was a really creepy Celtic festival going on.  I love going to these weird things where normal people loose their minds, dress up in renaissance garb, and pretend they aren't the boring people that they are. There was a booth were a guy was selling real swords, and another one where you could look up your last name and see your coat of arms.  I looked up my mom's maiden name and found that our family motto is: To hope for better things.  I thought those were good words to live by.  We went back to the cabin, and made chicken fajitas over the fire (SO GOOD). Sarah was the main chef for the meal, and while cooking one of the rocks of the fire circle flipped over and nailed her in the shin.  After dinner we went to the hot springs and relaxed in the water.  The warm pool was my favorite, but I had to not think about the warm nasty water that didn't have any chlorine in it to kill all the grossness coming off the 20 other bodies in the pool.  Although, since I was the one who hadn't showered that day and had hiked for the majority of it, my body was probably emanating the most grossness.    Sunday morning breakfast was my meal. I got up before everyone, started the fire and breakfast.  Right when they all woke up I had it done. I would have been such a good pioneer mom.  After breakfast of pancakes, sausage, hash browns, strawberries and peaches, we cleaned up the cabin.  By this time I was feeling so gross and dirty it was unreal.  We went to purgatory and since the weather was nice we got to ride down the alpine slide.  Colin and I raced down and I schooled him.  True, he was at a disadvantage because the grass we growing over his track.  It whipped him in the face, causing him to loose his balance, and his shoes.  We had to wait at the bottom for the next people to bring his shoes back down to him.    Then, we went out to X-rock and went climbing.  It was really fun.  I've done some indoor climbing, and I didn't really care much for it.  This was my first time outdoors and it was GREAT!  I got to do 3 climbs and from the top I could look out over the whole valley.  It was just amazing.  I wish I had a digital camera to take pictures of everything (hint hint).  I had to use Abbey's harness and Sarah's shoes, which was a bummer.  Maybe those will be my next purchases (or a good birthday present).    From X-rock we just packed it all up and drove home.  I played the best prank of my life on the way home.  Just after getting down from the major pass, we stopped at a little gas station.  Amy went to the bathroom before me, and left the keys in the bathroom.  I was just about to tell her that and give them back when the diabolical side of my brain kicked into gear.  I slipped them into my pocket and said nothing.  We went back to the car and Amy realized she didn’t have the keys.  She started freaking out, and she and Sarah went back into the gas station to look for them.  Then, Colin and I moved the car out of sight ran back to the station and told them that someone had stolen the car.  The look on their faces was priceless.  They really started freaking out and then Colin tossed them the keys.  One of them said, "How did someone steal the car without the keys?"  Then we told them that it was just behind the other building.  It was great. I was completely satisfied.    Now I am back at work and my poor little body is SO tired.  It's not used to this kind of physical strain.

      I didn't think that I wanted this new position in the detector lab so badly, but the closer my interview gets the more anxious I am. All three of the heads of the department are going to interview me at once, which will be a little intimidating.  I can just picture it now.  All three of them will be sitting behind a large shining mahogany desk staring down at me in a rickety rolling office chair with orange upholstery.  The room will be a little dark and shadowy except for the one bright hanging lamp above my head.  They will ask me questions about how to calculate the current flowing through a huge looped circuit and as the beads of perspiration start to develop on my forehead I will look to the ceiling trying to remember some fact I found trivial in school that would now impress them and show them I am worthy of such a prestigious position.  Yikes!  My interview is at 3 this afternoon in Boulder, so by 2:30 this work week will be over for me.  I'm heading down to Durango for the weekend with a group of friends, so there won't be any posts until I get back on Monday.

      I started reading Screwtape Letters again, and this time I read it with a pen.  There are so many interesting ideas that are mentioned in there and for me it totally helps to make notes in the book.  This may make me a bigger nerd than anyone originally supposed, but I'm willing to bare that burden.  The book is WAY good, and I'd suggest it to anyone who wants a little introspection.  During work I had some interesting email correspondence with a friend.  I'm so glad it happened, because it cleared up a lot of issues between us.  Hopefully we can just move on now.  The only thing is it would have been so much easier to just talk about it a month ago instead of me having to be a detective to try to understand how he felt.  On the other hand, I probably needed the time to really come to grips with the truth.  After work I went shopping and found the cutest skirt and Nordstrom (my home away from home).  I probably shouldn't have bought it since I still need to buy a washer and dryer, but it was just SO cute.  Plus, I haven't bought any new clothes in over a month.  What am I working so hard for if I don't allow myself some carefree spending?  I stopped by the men's department to see if my friend was at work.  He is my crush's younger brother and I still haven’t yet decided if I want to pursue the older or younger version.  Is the brother switch possible if I change my mind half way through the summer?  He wasn't at work, so I didn't get to see him.  Then, I stopped by Galyans to watch Eric ring people up for a minute.  He is so proficient at that.   A big group of us went to dinner because a missionary that served in our ward came back for a visit.  It was weird to see him as a normal kid and meet his family and stuff. I got sucked into a long conversation with his mom, which was really strange.  She kept asking me questions and then she was listening so intently to my answers that it kind of creeped me out.  I had a hard time maintaining eye contact.  Anyway, when they left she gave me a big hug and then held me there while she told me that I had to come out to California and stay with them some time.  I was like, "thanks, I will for sure," but I was thinking, "no way, you psycho."

      So last night for FHE we brought in a bunch of vegetables and toothpicks and had people make cars out of them.  Then, we raced them down a partially collapsed table.  I thought this activity was going to be lame, but it was actually pretty funny to see someone let a potato with 4 zucchini wheels go and see it come to a halt half way down the ramp.  Plus, my new crush came and he was dreamy, so that made it worth while.  I know I said I was going to avoid romantic entanglements this summer, but he is going back to school at the end of the summer, so this has the potential to be a fun summer fling.  I was getting a pretty good vibe from across the room, but right after the activity was over I had to go to our weekly FHE committee meeting and by the time that was over he had left.  Lame.  I hope he comes to institute on Wednesday.    I also got my hair cut yesterday.  It was REALLY cute and I wish I had a digital camera so I could show you all, but unfortunately I don't have one. (My birthday is coming up soon, hint, hint)

      50 cool things about my dad:  1.  My mom taught early morning seminary when my sister and I were in high school.  Even though he didn't have to get up, he woke up at 5:30 and made us breakfast every morning.  It was a huge sacrifice, but meant so much to me.  To this day I don't really like pancakes because he once made them with 7-up and ruined them for life. 2.  He watches C-span in the morning. 3.  He wears a housecoat we affectionately refer to as "the coat of many colors" which isn't really long enough, and has no problem going out to get the mail wearing it. 4.  When he gets mad coaching little league football he throws his hat to the ground and steps on it. 5.  He can make friends with anyone. 6.  He is the best pillow for naps during church. 7.

He always buys treats at the movies. 23. He totally pulls off the "blonde" hairs that are starting to sprout up. 24. He is a total sucker for his grandkids. 25. He is the best dancer ever, (to see what he dances like, just watch Jack Black in School of Rock). 26. He is personally watching the career of Washington State Football player Jeremy Williams to make sure he doesn't get overlooked. 27. He has always been great to my boyfriends, even if he doesn't really like them. 28. He can build a really great fence. 29. His grass looks better than the neighbor's who had it professionally planted. 30. He thinks it is cool that my mom is a garden fanatic. 31. He always puts up Christmas lights. 32. He was a great example of strength and reliance on God's love to me when my aunt died. 33. He loves unconditionally. 34. He is always the one willing to sacrifice for family. 35. He and I have the same vacation style (we both like to DO things on a vacation instead of sit there and relax) 36. He encourages me to try new things, even if I am afraid I'll be bad at them. 37. He always thinks I am popular, even though I'm really not. 38. He thinks I'm funny. 39. He attended every violin concert while I was growing up, even thought he probably wished they were football games.  40. He thinks I'm a rocket scientist. 41. His favorite store at the mall is Williams & Sonoma. 42. He makes the best muffins. 43. Someday he will own a sports car. 44. He can play the harmonica like a champ! 45. He is my personal hero. 46. He is on the Washington State alumni football club, but went to Utah State. 47. He drives a tool box on wheels, every guy's dream. 48. He can fix pretty much anything, given enough time. 49. He raised two of the girliest girls on the planet. 50. I love him SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much.

      Today my functional manager called and told me that I might be moving to a different department beginning in July.  I am really excited about this because it is a chance to learn a completely different discipline.  And, since it is completely different for me, they won't be expecting much.  I can impress them with how fast I can pick up on things.  The position is going to be in the detector lab here at my company.  I'll probably spend a year learning all about how to design them and how to use them.  Then, I'll probably start doing a lot of traveling to vendors, and being leased out to different programs to give them design advice as an "expert" in the field.  I am way excited.  The only hitch is that they leader of the lab wanted a senior designer (which I am far from).  My functional thought that what I lacked in experience I could make up with enthusiasm.  The other hitch is that there are a few people up for the job, so I have to interview to see if I am the best fit for the job.  I really hope I get it, as it seems like something small enough within the company that I could really excel at.  Just thought I'd share my good news with everyone.

      Alright, so the quasi date was supposed to happen last night.  I worked until 5 (way later than usual) and then went home.  It was a downpour, so I had already decided to bail on the invitation to play Frisbee golf.  At around 6 the guy called me and asked me if I still wanted to go.  I politely declined citing the torrential downpour as my excuse.  Plus, I just started a book that is proving to be way cooler than I thought it would be.  This is how the conversation went:  Him: so we are probably going to play at 7 Me: Umm, I don't really think I want to run around in the rain Him:  yeah, that’s what I told the guys, but they are still going to play so.... Me:  Well, I really don't want to be outside, so maybe we can just hang out some other time.  Thanks so much for inviting me, but I just don't think so.  (this is me trying to end the conversation) Him:  Well, how was work today (this was him trying to keep the conversation going) Me:  Not bad, (me confused at why he didn't take the hint that I didn't want to talk more)  What proceeded was about 20 minutes of him trying to "get to know me" like we were on a date or something.  You have to understand that I HATE talking on the phone.  I just can't do it.  It was bad.  I kept trying to make jokes and after everyone there was a little pause of silence like he didn't think they were funny.  The whole vibe I was getting was that he was really interested in me.  I just don't want to lead this kid on at all because he is the type of guy who is just so nice I would never want to hurt his feelings.  Also, he is too nice, I would probably never want to date him either.  I'm just trying to avoid all romantic entanglements this summer.    So when I finally got off the phone I was drained.  I tried to tell my roommate about it, but she was busy falling asleep while cuddling with her boyfriend, so she really didn’t give me the sympathetic response that I needed. I tried to relate this concern of someone maybe liking me and me not liking them to Eric, but he was of no help either.  He just said, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."  Maybe it is still too soon to go to him for guy advice.   Anyway, I read the whole evening and then went over to steal some of Brett's butterscotch chip cookies.  They were delish!

      Yesterday after work I went to my fiddling lesson.  My teacher informed me that she was going to movie to Idaho in August to be with her boyfriend.  This came as a total shock to me, and it really sucks because I am just getting confident in my playing and switching teachers is always bad.  Plus, the closest teacher is out in Longmont, which is a freaking far drive.  Also, I seriously doubt that anyone could be as cool as my present teacher.  She is my same age, and has won the national fiddling competition a bunch of times.  I like knowing that I am learning from the best.  Oh well, the change will be good for her because she has never lived outside of Colorado.  I think people need to experience actually living in a lot of different places before they can really make an informed choice about where they want to be.  Not that I'm really following that idea but.....  So last night at institute the teacher asked me to prepare a 5 minute discussion for class next week.  The topic is "what advice I would like a friend to give a guy who was trying to date me."  Yeah, loaded question.  About two weeks ago he had us write our advice to the opposite gender on a sheet of paper and hand it in so he could use it for the lesson.  I was still a little upset with how my relationship with my ex-boyfriend had ended, so I kind of went off on the paper.  Anyway, we were supposed to write our names on the sheet if we wanted to present our ideas to the class.  I most definitely did NOT write my name down.  Unfortunately I think I was the only one in the class who actually took the exercise to heart, so the teacher asked me to talk to the class.  The more I think about it, the more I really have nothing to say.  The teacher confessed to me that there are a lot of guys in that class who are genuinely clueless about how to act with girls, and there are a few who feel that way specifically toward me.  Too bad I know which ones feel that way about me, and you can read about them in the "weirdos coming out of the woodwork" post from a week ago.  I don't want to get up there and be like, "just be a nice guy and some girl will give you a chance" when I fully know that I would never be that girl for most of them. It is hard to admit, but sometimes there just needs to be a spark there.  If there isn't, it probably won’t ever happen.    After class I went to the movies with my friend Brett.  I totally love this kid.  He is so funny and interesting and down to earth.  But, alas, no spark.  We saw the movie SAVED!.  It was kind of interesting.  Seeing it as a devout Christian, I'm sure it was different for me than for most of the audience.  And, I had to think a while to decide whether I liked it or not.  In the end I decided that I did.  Beware, it is a little blasphemous, and if you can't laugh at yourself you probably shouldn't see it.    Oh, I almost forgot.  I gave my number to someone yesterday.  It was quite the rush since it hasn't happened to me in quite a while.  There is a surprising amount of power in that action.

      So what I thought might possibly be a date definitely is not.  The guy who asked me out on Monday just emailed me and made it very clear that it was going to be me and 4 guys.  Also, he just wanted to let me know that if I wasn't comfortable with that, he wouldn’t be offended if I didn't want to go.  I am so confused.  The way I interpret that is, "oh no, now she is going to think this is a date and I DO NOT want to go out with her at all, even if someone paid me."  So much for the self esteem boost.

      So last night my roommate and I went to see Stepford Wives.  This movie was horrible. The story had some potential, but it just didn't hook me at all.  Plus, half way through the movie, the sound cut out and the "movie tunes" started playing.  Maybe I missed a critical part of the plot during those 3 minutes, but I seriously doubt it.  The only character I really found entertaining was the flamboyantly gay guy.  Other than that the movie was slow, predictable, and shallow.  In an attempt to break the cycle of bad movies, I went to Target and bought 50 first dates.  Eric came over and watched it with me.  It was kind of weird because when I saw it in the theaters we were together and holding hands and stealing looks at each other during cute scenes.  This time when love scenes came on I had to keep telling myself that we were over and that it is better this way.  Which it really is....I'm sure....at least I think so anyway.   So here is what not to do.  Yesterday I told my stand in boss that I don't have any work.  Since my real boss is away on vacation for the week, I am kind of leaderless.  Anyway, today my stand in boss gave me the task of updating the weekly drawing tree.  This doesn't sound like any fun at all.  It will probably take me 15 minutes once I really sit down and do it, and I have nothing else to do for the rest of the day.  I really need to get on a new program here at my company.  This one is slowly draining my life force away.

      So I am totally bored at work again and I was trying to find some interesting blogs to read.  Since starting this I feel like I have become part of a group of people in the universe who like to tell strangers what is going on in their lives.  My search this morning didn't yield very many blogs that I was really hooked by.  My favorites so far are Loyd's (my little sister’s friend) and this girl's called "celibate in the city."  Both of these blogs tell of the drama that is going on in their lives, which I find the most interesting.  A good blog (in my opinion) is one that seems real.  I don't like the ones that seem really pretentious and overly philosophical.  I just don't have the energy to read them.  Has anyone found cool blogs that are funny and well written?

      So last night I actually got asked out on a date.  At least I think I did.  The guy came up to me and was like, "what are you doing on Thursday” I thought for a minute, realized I didn't have any plans, and said, "nothing, why” Then he said, "Do you want to go to "culture night" with me."  This sounded very date-ish and actually kind of interesting, so I said yes enthusiastically.  He then went on to explain that he and his three roommates go out and do something Boulder-ish every Thursday night.  This Thursday they are going to go play Frisbee golf.  In my mind this outing changed from "me on a date with this kid" to "me hanging out with his three other roommates."  It stepped down from date, to hanging out with friends.  Although I'm not really interested in this guy I was still disappointed because it means that it really isn't a date at all but rather just me being one of the guys....again.  Alas, I am still claiming it is a date-ish kind of thing and going with that.  My ego needs a little boost after all these semi rejections I've been getting recently.

      Do you know what I think the rudest thing you can do to a person in the next cubical over?  Buy a bag of cornuts from the vending machine and then snack away on them at 3 in the afternoon.  Ever since I was a little girl I have found the scent of these crunchy demons nauseating.  Now I am confined in my little gray cell with the pungent odor of these "treats of the devil" wafting over to me.  Has anyone ever heard of cruel and unusual punishment?!?!?  This is the modern day equivalent of Chinese water torture.

      So I knew that writing what I really thought in this format might get me into trouble one of these days.  By nature, I don't really have the capacity to look at what I write and see how it might be hurtful to others.  I am truly sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings that I really care about.  This is not meant to be some kind of passive/aggressive way to tell you how I feel.  This is more meant for me to have an outlet to get things off my chest and hurl them out into cyberspace for the entertainment of others.  If you read something, before getting mad and overreacting, just call me and we can talk about it. I can explain what I meant, and if I really did mean something that you got your feelings hurt by, well at least it is out in the open and you really know how I feel.  I am entitled to my own thoughts and feelings.

      So the Monday morning blogs are going to be really long because I don't have the internet and home and I come in early to use my work computer to enter all this stuff.  Just and explanation for the curious.....  The surprise part for Sarah went of without a hitch.  It was so fun to just have a group of close friends sit around and talk.  For some reason lately I have been cast as the court jester of my friends. I feel like I am the person that everyone is sitting around watching and waiting for them to say something funny.  I haven't been that person for a really long time.  I am not a "yellow" personality at all, but lately I feel like that is becoming my niche in the group.  Maybe it is because everyone else is dating someone so as the token single gal I feel like I have to perform to tear their attention away from their significant other.  Well, whatever the cause, I am quickly becoming the amusement of the group. I'm not really sure if I like it yet or not.  Stay posted.   So get this... Last Sunday (as week ago) my friend Greg invited me to go out on his boat on Saturday to do a little water skiing.  I love water skiing, so the promise of this activity is what sustained me through the hellish work week.  Also, I was my friend Sarah's birthday so I invited her and Colin to go with us.  I thought this would be fine because Greg told me to invite a couple of people. Anyway, I tried calling him Wednesday, then Thursday. I still hadn't heard from him, so I called his parent's home number.  I was that desperate.  I got a hold of him and he told me that his cell phone didn't get reception at his parent's house (where he is living for the summer between years of med school).  I thought, "Convenient".  Anyway, I lightheartedly asked him if we were in fact going to go out the next day.  He informed me that he actually had already invited other people, so there wasn't room for me.  I felt totally rejected. I hate it when I get ditched because it drags up fairly painful memories of high school parties that I didn't get invited to, or group outings that I was "mistakenly" not informed of.  Anyway, he was sincerely apologetic and said that we'd go next weekend, but how am I supposed to really believe that he wants to hang out with me.  Whatever.  His loss.   Instead, we went to the Denver Zoo. It was really fun and kind of disturbing at the same time.  One of the gross things that happened, that I can write about without getting totally nauseated, happened in the gorilla house.  We were just sitting there watching the gorillas, when the big male kind of rolled over and puked.  If that weren't gross enough, he then started to use his index finger to scoop it back up and eat it again.  This was totally nasty, but not the end. I guess he thought that the finger to the mouth technique wasn’t effective enough, because he then proceeded to lower his face to the cement and in two great slurps he sucked it all back up off the floor of his less than sterile cage.  I was gagging and had to look away or the little blonde headed 6 year old in front of me was going to have Katie puke all over him.  I really don't do well with that stuff.    An equally disturbing thing I saw at the zoo did not occur inside a pen, but amongst the onlookers.  I was just casually walking down the wide cement path between the snow leopard and the zebras when I saw it.  There was a four year old boy sitting in a stroller.  At first this looked normal until I noticed that this kid had a full on Mohawk.  The sides of his head were shave and everything.  The odd thing was that the parents looked totally normal.  I was totally confused.  Obviously this child was not going through any kind of self exploration or teenaged rebellion.  The parents had to have done that to their own kid.  I was totally confused.  What is this society coming to when normal looking parents give their kid a Mohawk.  Is this going to become mainstream?  If so, what will punk rock kids do to be "different"?  Get a crew cut?    Sunday I was getting ready to go to church when I checked my phone and realized that I had a message.  It was my ex-boyfriend.  He had been spending the weekend in Utah at his brother's wedding.  His flight landed at 10:30, which was very inconvenient as church starts at 10.  Anyway, he was planning on taking the bus back from the airport, but he called me and left the most pathetic message I have ever heard in my life.  He said he was sick and couldn't take the bus and would I please come get him.  This was a serious dilemma for me.  Keep in mind that a month ago I asked him to take me to the airport before a week long trip and he said no, so I ended up paying $60 to park my car out there.  Anyway, it only took me a minute to decide that there was no way I was going to leave him sick and stranded at the airport.  He is my best friend here still.  Anyway, I told my roommate Amy about it and she said I should just let him figure it out on his own. I told my parents I was helping him and my mom thought it was a bad idea.  I got him home, went to the store to get him some sick person supplies, and then we both took naps at his house. Boys are such babies when they don't feel well.  I spent the whole rest of the day doing the mountain of laundry that had steadily built up to almost unmanageable girth.  It took me 5 hours.  I was going to go back over to his house to watch a movie, but I had a headache and went home.    I really wanted to go to church so that I could be rude to those guys who snubbed me for dinner last week, but I guess my immaturity will have to wait.  Darn.

      1.  Bring doughnuts.  If you bring food into work and leave it in the break room, you instantly become the "thoughtful" person in the office.  The one potential pitfall is if no one sees you leaving the box there.  If no one sees you, you don't get the credit and you gesture was a waste.  2.  Be able to help some of the "older" employees figure out their excel spreadsheet.  Often this only requires you showing them how to highlight an entire column at once.    3.  Find out what people like to talk about.  Typically this is about them.  People love to talk about themselves, or something that interests them.  Not very often will people be like "enough about me and what I am interested in, lets talk about you." Usually this one topic will last for months, if you explore well.  For example, I met the one guy and he loves to talk about his son's little league sports teams.  We've been talking about that for 2 years now.  Feigning interest has become a special skill of mine.    4.  Know when to be cynical and when to be supportive.  Usually when you are surrounded in the break room by peers, you are cynical.  When you are in a meeting with your lead, you are supportive.  Some people have been working for 10 years and still have not caught on to this.  Sad, but true.   5. Even if you are REALLY busy, there is always time to go to lunch.  Period.  6. Get a candy dish.  90% of the world is filled with people whose affections can be purchased with a mini snickers bar.   Caveat Emptor: Following these rules may not lead to much upward mobility within the company, but they sure will make coming into work a more pleasant daily experience.

      I freeloaded at a company picnic last night.  We played volleyball, and I once again had the chance to show my overwhelming lack of athletic ability.  I wanted to play frisbee, since I am at least decent at that, but it was too windy.    It is so funny, the picnic was for all the interns that Ball hired for the summer.  There are about 60 college aged kids from schools all over the country. Probably about 1/3 of those are girls.  There is this one kid who is pretty much drop dead gorgeous, and all of the girls sat around last night giggling over him.  I was floored.  These were all smart, attractive, cool girls acting like high school cheerleaders.  Hilarious.  It was funny to see girls in action becuase you can totally pick out the ones who are trying desperately for his attention.  For example, this one girl kicked sand up at him when they were both up at the net, and then she decided to cheer every time his team gave up a point.  Throw a cute guy in the mix, and girls loose their minds.   After about an hour I started to have a massive allergy attack, so I went home.  I am such at party animal.

      Why is it that as soon as word is out in a singles ward that you are no longer dating someone all the weirdos come out of the woodwork?  You may be saying to yourself, "they do not, this girl is being dramatic and over exaggerating the situation."  To those of you who doubt let me site two of the most recent examples.  1.  About a week ago I left the building after church and some stranger had left a burnt CD on my car.  I looked at it dubiously as I read the hand printed title "Songs about Something."  Frightened, I yell to my friend Sarah to come and listen to the tracks with me.  Somewhere in between Alison Krauss's "When you say nothing at all" and that stake dance immortal classic that starts "Every time our eyes meet, this feeling inside me...." I turned to her with fear in my eyes.  The only person I know well enough to give me a CD of love songs would be my ex-boyfriend, and not only does he have WAY better taste in music than that, but also there is no way he would do something that nice for me.  That left about 50 strange suspects.  For the last 2 years there has been this kid in the ward who keeps telling me that he is crazy about me.  I think this is strange because I don't really know the kid, and the way he lets me know about his affections always kind of weird me out; like leaving an anonymous CD of love songs on my car.  Just a strange one.  Anyway, he was my prime suspect.  About 2 days later I got a call on my phone from a number I didn't recognize.  Ordinarily I wouldn't answer, but that night I was throwing a party for a friend, and I thought it might be someone who was lost.  Anyway, I answered the phone and this voice came on.  He asked if I like what he left.  I was like, "oh, so you left it" (I didn't recognize the voice still).  He said yes.  I asked who it was.  He said his name.  I said "oh".  He said, "well, do you have any comments?"  I said, "(name here), I don't even really know you. I think it is a little strange that you act this way toward me since you don't really know me either."  He said "oh" and hung up.  See what I mean, weirdos out of the woodwork.  2. My second example comes from last night.  We'd just finished institute class, and I was hanging around talking and being social.  Anyway, this kid came up to me and attempted some intricate handshake that you had to be a Mensa candidate to figure out.  Anyway, after the embarrassing moment of me not being able to figure out his physical greeting initiation, I tried to blame my ineptitude on the fact that I have a cut on my thumb.  From this he decided that it was time to show me all of the scars he has. Just as a side note, this is not a way to impress girls.  We don't really care to see that you've been a moron in the past and have the physical proof to back up your claim. Anyway, then he moved to show me a bruise on his right hand between his pinky knuckle and the next one over.  He then proudly boasted that this injury came from the punching bag. I guess he punched it over and over so fast and hard that he hurt his hand.  He was like "yeah, I can hit that things so fast.  Everyone is really impressed when I do it.  Last time though I was kind of dragging my hand past the bag, so when I was done I had a bruise."  I was just kind of looking at him in confusion.  Is this supposed to impress me?  Honestly, I don't think I've ever included on my "list of qualities for an ideal man" the ability to pummel something to pulp. After an awkward moment of silence he said, "Well, I'll give you a call sometime, I've got your number."  In my head I thought, "Yippee!  All my dreams are coming true. Now I can dust off that old oak chest that contains my dowry filled with lace doilies and hand appliquéd quilts.  Now I have a man who will beat me if I ever think of leaving the kitchen without a baby in my belly, or a nice pair of shoes.  The come running of the woodwork.

      Yesterday I went to see Harry Potter again.  It was pretty good, but since it was the second time and we were seeing at 10:15, it lacked the excitement and suspense required to keep me alert the entire time (translation...I fell asleep for about 10 minutes).   I started Da Vinci Code.  So far it is pretty good, but at first it seemed like he was going to give me tons of superfluous information to the plot.  Now that the story is really rolling, it is better.  I REALLY hope that he and Sofie don't end up hooking up, because that would be a total repeat of the Vittoria Vetra story line he used in Angles and Demons.  You know, the smart confident woman who has lost a loved one (in A&D it was her dad, in DVC it is her grandpa) and through all the experiences they share they end up in love.  That would be lame, but maybe I'll like it after all.    Last night there was the most incredible lightening storm.  The lightening filled the entire sky, like natural fireworks.  I just sat on my porch playing my guitar and watching the sky.  It was really nice to be alone and just taking that all in.  I haven't been happy to be alone in a really long time but last night I was.  It was nice to just think whatever I want and not feel the need to fill the silence with idle chatter.  I haven't seen that kind of lightning storm since last summer with Bryan.  We were just driving down the road in Provo and all the sudden we pulled over, sat on the curb and just watched.  Neither of us felt the need to comment or talk, we just sat there together and watched.  I miss having friends like that around.

      I don't know what to read next.  I think I'll give Da Vinci Code a try.  Everyone else has read it, and I want to be able to talk with everyone about it, so I'll follow the herd.  My two friends who have most recently read it finished it really fast, so I need suggestions for my next endeavor.  I like pretty much anything.  My latest books have been:  Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum, Angles and Demons by the author of Da Vinici Code, Life of Pi, David Copperfield, No Second Chance by Harlen Corben. (Just so you know the wide range of books I like)

      For those of you who don't know, the Denver-Metro area is experiencing a serious heat wave right now.  Yesterday it almost broke 100 degrees.  Normally this wouldn't be that big of a deal, but my new townhome's airconditioner won't come on.  I don't know if it is broken, or if I am just too dumb to figure out how to turn it on.  All I know is last night my room was a million degrees.  Lying on my bed, I felt like a strip of bacon writhing in a frying pan.  I had to go downstairs and sleep on the fouton.  Last night I thought my roommates were going to lynch me when I told them that I hadn't called the landlord about it yet.  The murderous glints in their eyes were frightening enough to propel me to action.  I called the lady this morning, so hopefully soon we will have an icy cold chill circulating through our abode.

      So there are times in life that I wish I had a video recorder taping what was happening.  That way I could rewind the tape and get an outsiders view of what happened.  Maybe then I would be able to understand what was going on.  Last night I went over to my best friends house.  I got a CD of photos and I wanted to use his computer to check them out.  Anyway, when I got there he informed me that he was deciding whether or not to bail on the rest of the summer semester and go be a camp leader for this bike trip camp in Massachusets.  The only catch was that he would have to be out there this weekend.  Plus, his brother is getting married in Utah on Saturday, so his plan would be to leave here on Thursday (2 days from now) and then just fly out to Boston right after the wedding.    My honest frist reaction to this news was to be thrilled for him.  It is a once in a lifetime chance for him to go out there and do things that he absolutely loves.  He'll get to see a new part of the country (one I've always wanted to visit) and meet some really good people.  Plus, he would have a significant amount of responsibility, which I think would be good for him.    My second reaction was dread.  I'm not having the best of time here in Colorado right now and he is my very best friend.  How am I going to deal with a job I'm not satisfied by, a social life that is reduced to hanging out with serious couples, no real potential to meet anyone new and intriguing, and a calling that is the bane of my existance withouth him?  Who will I make jokes with?  Who will I watch movies with until late at night?  Who will I build rockets with and then not launch them off?  Who will go to Costco with me to eat samples?  Who will contiuously make me want to exercise more?  Who will challenge me to learn more about who I am?    After talking with my roommate, who has a suprising amount of wisdom, I begin to see that this is the best thing that could happen for everyone involved.  The break up process requires time apart.  I should know that after dealing with my last serious boyfriend.  I had to leave the state to fully get over him.  2 months apart will be good.  When he comes back we can just talk and have fun becuase we will both be past the hurt.    After finding out that he was planning on leaving Colorado, I brought up how much I'd been hurt recently by his "activity" with this other girl.  I told him what I thought and how I felt.  For the first time since he dumped me I honestly felt like he was sorry for hurting me.  And that he missed me.  The only thing anyone wants to hear after they have been dumped is not that the other person wants to get back together, but that the other person regrets their choice.  The acknowledgement that if the other person could change the past they would.  This is what I got from him last night.  I thought it would make me feel better than it did.  The past is over.  There is nothing I can do about it now, except learn.

      So I wrote this a year ago, but my sister thinks it is worth posting on here for anyones entertainment.  Boulder is a really strange place.  For the last week I have been driving into work, and on the side of the road a man has been putting up a chicken wire fence.  I thought, "My, that is strange.  The side of this busy road has to be city property.  I wonder what he thinks he is doing?" Yesterday I got the answer.  Imagine my surprise at 7:15 am when I see a herd of goats penned up on the side of one of the busiest streets in Boulder.  I guess here in this "earth friendly" city, they prefer to keep the weeds down by letting these goats roam next to cars going 50+ mph with only a chicken wire fence to stave off disaster. On the way home from work, I noted the excellent job the goats had done.  Not a blade of grass could be seen.  The once lush sides of the street were brown and dried up like the Oklahoma dust basin.  On the way to work this morning, I again saw the goats hard at work a little farther down the street.  The thing that got my attention was not the efficient way the goats controlled the overgrowth in the new area, but the ineptitude the city was showing in the area cleared out by the goats yesterday. They were sprinkling the dirt.  Gone was any reason for the watering to occur; yet the sprinklers came up to do their duty.  For those of you who don't know, every summer in Colorado is near drought season.  It boggled my mind why they took the time to control the grass, and then water it again.  Furthermore, are they not wasting the efforts of poor overworked goats by cultivating areas that the goats had previously demolished?  How are these goats going to feel pride in their work if “upper management” constantly reverses it?  Will they not see that their efforts are futile and give up?  Am I projecting my own views about my job onto these animals?  Things to think about.  Besides my philosophical musings about goats, and water conservation, things are going really well for me here in Colorado.  Last night a bunch of friends and I were going to go Red Rocks Amphitheatre to see Lord of the Rings 2 on an outdoor, big screen.  The whole place was sold out for a movie.  I was floored.  Some concerts don't even sell out this venue, but Lord of the Rings did.  Instead, we went to dinner at La Mariposa (yes, for you Spanish speakers, there is a restaurant called this, and no, the waiters aren't fems).  All five of us ordered the house special, a 20" long burrito.  In my mind this didn't sound very big.  I figured it would be long and skinny, churro-esque if you will.  When it came out, my spirits sank.  This log of Mexican joy was about 4" wide, and smothered in sauce, sour cream, and that lettuce. (Side note: why do they put that lettuce on Mexican food?  If they are trying to pretend that the meal is in some way healthy they aren't fooling anybody) Looking down at my plate that was easily twice as long as my body is wide was intimidating to say the least.  We all made jokes about the impossibility of finishing the monster.  We even took bets about how far we could go.  I set to the task of defeating this foe placed in front of me.  It was slow going, but bite after bite my competitive spirit began to come forth.  As I turned the half way point, I was a close second place behind my good friend Calvin.  Everyone's money was on him for the win.  As I hit the 2/3 mark I felt myself slow down and reassess the pros and cons of finishing this beast.  I realized that the burrito was the embodiment of everything I had given up on in life: the dreams not achieved, the relationships not pursued, the physical feats not surmounted.  My nerve was steeled.  Everything was riding on this one plate of Mexican cooking.  With five bites left on the plate I had been staring into for the past 45 minutes I felt victory immanent.  I took a break from my intense concentration to look around at the others and their quests to dominate the meal.  Calvin had given up with about 4 inches left on his plate.  Ben, the lightweight, had about the same amount left.  My only real competition was my friend Sarah.  She had only about 8 mouthfuls remaining.  As I lifted bite 5 to my mouth, the once delicious scent of shredded beef and refried beans wafted into my nostrils, causing me to involuntarily gag.  Breathing deeply I took a step back from the situation, and tried again.  I realized the only way I was going to get it all down was to act quickly and without thought, as so many important life decisions must be made.  I took a deep breath, and finished my plate. Immediately I was filled with mixed emotions.  Joy in conquering my demons, and nausea at having consumed at lease twice the amount of food any human body should hold.  Sweet victory, accompanied by overwhelming pain.  I have three lessons from this amazing night of self discovery: (1) A mans reach should exceed his grasp, (2) Mexican food should not be used for self validation, and (3) although it seems like a good idea at the time, eating competitions should be left to those with no job the next morning (I still feel like barfing).

      My sister found this little poem and I really sums up how I am feeling about things.  I loved you; and I probably still do, And for a while the feeling may remain-- But let my love no longer trouble you. I do not wish to cause you any pain. I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew The jealousy, the shyness--though in vain Made up a love so tender and so true, As may God grant you to be loved again.  Aleksander Pushkin 1828

      So the power is out right now in my building.  Actually, the whole building is out, except for the one little windwo-less room that my gray sided cubical is in.  How frustrating.  If the whole power were down I'd just leave now for an extra long lunch, but I feel that since I have power, I should try to get something done.  Responsibility is lame.

      Things I did this weekend:  -Only worked half a day on Friday -Met friends in Boulder for lunch at Illegal Pete’s (which blows Cafe Rio out of   the water).  I could only eat half of my burrito.  Sad showing. -Came home and started looking for my Gryffindor scarf for the premier.  Sadly, It was no where to be found. -Put on my homemade Harry Potter t-shirt. -Went with the Harry Potter crew to Galyans to show my best friend (in Colorado) who had to work what nerds we were.  I think he was impressed that we thought to include him, although he didn't say anything, so maybe he thought it was weird. -Showed up at the theatre in Denver an hour and a half early and sat in line.  You could cut the excited tension with a knife.  Some lady actually asked where I bought my shirt, which I thought was cool because I made it. While we waited, the theater provided little Lego kits of the knight bus.  I thought that was a really good idea.  -The movie was AWESOME!  True, it left out some really important facts, like the makers of the Marauder’s map, and that Harry's dad was a animangus and could turn into a stag (thus explaining why Harry thought it was his dad producing the patronus). We saw it on a IMAX screen, which I highly recommend because you are so close it feels like you are just hovering there with the movie happening all around you.  So cool. -Tried to get my car fixed Saturday morning, but it was going to take too long so I bailed. -Bought new underwear instead of doing laundry (the definition of a lazy person with a disposable income) -Finished Bourne Identity, then watched the movie.  The book was alright, except the love scenes were stupid, and obviously written by a man for a man. The movie was lame.  After reading the book, the movie lacked plot, intrigue and suspense.  It was watered down and not very believable.  Hollywood sucks.  -Went to go see Raising Helen.  Thought the movie was alright, but kind of slow.  Kate Hudson did a really good job, and even made me believe her character was upset.  This movie is definitely a budget hour, or date movie (since that would be free). -My new roommates and I made dinner together for the first time.  They are nice girls, but I don't really see any potential for real friendship, which is too bad.  After dinner we went to the park to play Frisbee.  I kicked myself while attempting a fancy jump catch and now have an alarmingly large and dark bruise on my shin.  I am the queen of grace. -Met one of my neighbors who made fun of me going miniature golfing on a Saturday night. -Went mini golfing with friends.  It started out really fun, but by the end of the night something happened between me and a friend and we were both upset with each other.  He was going to go to the grocery store with me after golfing, but when I showed up at his house he was already in bed.  I was really confused.  He was the one to remind me that I had to go to the store and then when I went over there he just bailed on me.  Normally, I wouldn't care much, but this friend and I go way back and have history so when he lets me down I overreact and take it WAY too personally. -Church was alright.  Sometimes I have the hardest time concentrating on what is happening.  After Sunday school Sarah, Colin and I got into a really interesting discussion.  Colin asked me whether or not I thought that God needed faith, since he is omniscient.  I said no, because faith implies a lack of knowledge.  If someone knew everything, they wouldn't need faith.  Faith is an entirely earthly concept.  Once we die and have a better perspective of things there will be no need for faith. Then we started talking about the foreknowledge of God and the impact that has on our agency.  My take was this: if God knew what we were going to do in every situation, which would take away our agency because God could never be wrong, so we could never make a choice contrary to what God already knew.  This doesn't really sit well with me, and since I believe agency is our supreme gift in this life, God must not know everything that is going to happen.  Colin and Sarah tried to tell me that just because God knows what is going to happen, we are still able to choose.  I don't get it, so I've decided not to confuse my little brain anymore.  God loves me, and wants to see me happy.  That is what I understand and can live with.   -Relief Society was painful, as usual. -After church I had to go to a meeting for my calling, which is FHE.  This is perhaps the church's worst calling.  As usual, I was left with coming up with a spiritual thought for the activity tonight.  Don't they know that I don't have the effort to deliver a spiritual thought on a weekly basis?  I don't get a manual or a block of scriptures, or even a topic.  I have to be creative and thoughtful and unique every single week, and it kills me.  -Then, after that meeting I asked this new kid that is kind of intriguing to me to come over for "family dinner" at my house.  On Sunday a group of my friends all get together and have dinner.  I was going to make enchiladas.  Well, this kid made me write out a map of how to get to my house, and he said he would be there at 4, with 5 of his roommates that I DIDN'T invite.   -I had to rush to my office to pick up the recipe, and then to the store to get the food (sorry mom for shopping on Sunday, but the ox was in the mire) -I spent 2 hours preparing for 15 people to come over to my house for dinner. -At 4 my friends all showed up.  Sarah made about 5 pounds of Spanish rice because she was expecting 5 strange guys to eat a lot. -At 4:30 this new kid called and said that they got stuck, but they were still planning on coming. -At 5 they called and said they hadn't left their apartment yet, but could they still come.  I said there wasn't much food left.  He asked if I was making more. I was so shocked by his rudeness that I said no, and that we all were leaving for a party in 30 mins, so maybe we could do it another time.  I couldn’t BELIEVE him.  It made me feel like crap because I don't usually ask boys over.  I'm hardly ever the pursuer of attention.  Anyway, I seriously doubt they will be getting a second invitation from me.  You only one chance to make a first impression, and believe me that is not a good way to go about it.  -My ex-boyfriend was there and later he told me that, for his sake, he was happy those guys didn't come over.  It isn't fair that he gets jealous of me trying to move on and meet new people.  He is the one who dumped me.  He is the one who kicked me to the curb.  If he didn't want me to flirt, or be with other people, then maybe he shouldn't have been so hasty to break up with me.  Plus, he is the one who brought some ho-ish chick to our friend's BBQ last week.  I told him once that it really hurt my feelings when he talked to that tramp on the phone in front of me.  After mini-golfing he told me that he didn't see the difference between him doing that, and me being nice to other guys in front of him.  At the time I didn't know what to say, but now that I've thought it over this is what I have to say to him:  There are two main differences in our situations. 1) he was the dumper, so he has the responsibility to be sensitive to me and my feelings.  He did the hurting, so he should be the one to try to patch up the friendship, if he really wants it like he says he does. 2) The guys I am flirting with are strangers.  They are not people that I am making out with (like he is with his little friend).  -After dinner we went to a friend’s birthday party.  It was nice, but I only stayed an hour. -After that a few of us went swimming, which was SO nice.   This is the world's longest entry, so if you made it to the end of this saga, you deserve a medal.

      So not that I am cynical because I am now relagated back to "single" status, but whats up with EVERYONE having a significant other around me?  Honestly, I have like 3 friends who aren't dating.  And even worse, they are all dating each other, which means that when we go on big group activities it somehow feels like a large group date with me as the chaperone or something.    Take last night.  I was just casually sitting out on my front porch reading my book.  The temperature was perfect, a sweet breeze lilting on the air, when my roommate and her boyfriend came up and starting talking.  Don't get me wrong, I love my roommate, and I'm actually a big fan of this kid she is dating right now.  He just came back from Hawaii, and brought me chocolate covered macadamia nuts (my dream).  Yeah, I'm easy to impress, bring me back a gift and you have the roommate approval for life.  Anyway, they haven't seen each other in over a week so the mushy factor has been increase by about a million percent.  Gag! They mercifully left to go work out together (another whole topic of converstion) and I was left to collect my thoughts and continue reading.  About an hour later Colin and Sarah came over and hung out for a while, so it was just the 5 of us.  Actually, it isn't that bad because both of these couples are totally cool and don't make me feel akward to hang out with them, but the truth is still there.  All four of them have people they are crazy about, who they would do anything for and I have me.  Which, on second thought, is saying a lot since I am so cool.

      Alright, so tonight is the opening night for Harry Potter and I am WAY excited for the movie.  Me and every other little 10 year old kid.  Anyway, my friends and I all made shirts for the movie.  Mine says in big red letters "RON WEASLEY is my head boy."  You wouldn't get it unless you've read book 5.  Anyway, my roommate made one for her boyfriend that says "I (heart) Hermionie" and it has hearts on both of the sleeves.  I can't believe he is actually going to wear it.  He said he would dress up in anything as long as she held his hand.  That makes me want to just puke.  How come every feels the need to be mushy around me all the time?

      So yesterday after a great institute class I went for frozen custard with two people who are rapidly becoming some of my closest friends.  I got a raspberry/strawberry blizzard type thing, which was dreamy. (if you haven't noticed by now recording the food I eat is a recurring thing for me.  It always has been, and always will be)   We took our frosty desserts and walked all over "the hill."  For those of you who don't know, "the hill" in Boulder is where all the CU students live.  It is like "south of campus" in Provo, except lots more empty kegs.    Anyway, we were walking around and just talking about some really cool things.  It has been a while since I have just talked about everything and nothing with friends.  I get so busy with work and distracted by movies that I forget the most important thing is just to talk and have fun.    Plus, ever since my boyfriend broke up with me a month ago I haven't felt like there was anyone else I could really talk with.  For some reason, last night did the trick and I just feel so much better.  He is not the only person who gets me here in Colorado.  I do have friends that care and think I am fun to hang out with, even thought the thought of scaling the shear rocky face of a mountian or riding a bike over a ledge isn't in the least appealing.

      Just in case anyone cared, my new favorite treat is cold apple pie and hot chocolate.  Apple pie is alright on its own, and so is hot chocolate, but combined these two into a mid afternoon snack and you have a glorious explosion of ambrosial goodness.    (I am fully aware of how strange I am)

      My sister is so smart.  Look what she wrote:           What's wrong with being the same as some in particular ways? I mean you are LDS so that, by default, is going to be the same as most of the people you are around there in Provo. I would also say that, at the same time, you ARE different than a lot of other people you are around, even with religion. I don't think you need to flaunt differences and/or controversy to be a unique individual (which is what it sounds like you are going for.) Perhaps if you just took the time to sit back and realize who you are and are not, without the pressure of being "different" then you will realize that it doesn't matter. Just so long as you are who you want to be then it doesn't matter what everyone else is like. This is just a thought and not necessarily related to this idea. When we start describing ourselves we do it in terms of things that make us different than others. Like I wouldn't say I'm a human being because everyone else is that too. Instead I'd probably say something like I'm a redhead or something like that. Anyway, you can look at yourself either way, as being like everyone around you or different than others. I just don't see how it matters all that much. It's good to set goals for yourself, but you shouldn't worry as to whether they're mainstream or not. Probably you already are thinking like that anyway, but yeah. I'm awesome.

      So I was talking with a friend last night and we stumbled onto a topic that I thought was pretty interesting.  I asked him if he thought that a person should just say everything that they think and feel.  He said yes, and that it is better to have things out in the open so that there is no misunderstanding.  I thought that was a good point.  Later, I was talking to my roommate and asked her the same question.  She said that she thought there were times when it was better to leave some things unsaid.    Looking back at my personal experiences, there are definitely moments where I wish I had said more and times I completely regret things I have said.  Usually the regrets come from things I said in the moment of blinding redheaded fury.  I’m afraid that I will probably never be able to stop saying those things that is just part of my flawed nature. Sometimes my regretted comments come after much thought, like the conversation I had with some friends a couple of weeks ago down in Havasu canyon.  Those are the times I wish I had just held my tongue.   On the other hand, there are times when I should have said what I think, but my dumb pride got in the way.  You know, stuff like telling other people that I need them, or I made a mistake, or I can’t do everything on my own.  Those are all things I wish I would have told people in the moment.    I guess what it all boils down to is that it really depends on the outcome of the situation whether or not I am glad, or regret what I said.  And, since there is no way of really being able to tell what the outcome will be ahead of time, there is no way to control whether I will be pleased, or disappointed by my actions.  Sticky situation…..

      Right now I am reading The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum.  Ordinarily I would never read this type of book on my own, but it came HIGHLY recommended by a good friend, so I’m giving it a whirl.  It started out kind of slow, but is getting better.  It is obviously a “boy” book, as the only female in the book is a clear conquest of the protagonist.  Actually, at first I was really turned off by the whole captor/captive love affair, but at least the chick has turned out somewhat intelligent, so maybe I’ll hold my feminist judgment until I’ve actually finished the book.  I saw the movie, but it is A LOT different from the book.  I can hardly even see a similar thread between the book and movie.  Why does Hollywood need to dumb down the characters to make them more palatable for the general masses?  Do they think we are some kind of brainless horde that can only appreciate sensationalism?

      I had sushi for lunch today.  Actually, it wasn't even really sushi, it was california rolls, teryaki chicken and goya (I forget how to spell the last one).  The last thing was my favorite and totally reminded me of potstickers.  They were totally enjoyable. I do'nt know why, but I just can't get down with sushi.  You take a big ole bite of food and there is so much of it in your mouth at once you gag.  Then, the texture is just totally weird and there is so much rice.  Plus, I think the combination of soy sauce and wasabi is strange.  It's only my second time trying it, but both times have left something to be desired.  On a positive note, I really like miso soup, and the salad dressing on the house salad, and the salty soy beans.

      Sarah and I went to 7eleven yesterday on our way down to the temple to get slurpees.&nbsp; As I spotted the building on the horizon my spirits lifted.&nbsp; Nothing can make my day better than enjoying a frosty, cherry, beverage with a friend on a warm evening.&nbsp; Anyway, we parked and entered the divine institution. As we made our way back to the slurpee producing fountain of dreams, I began to experience a slight premonition of anxiety.&nbsp; The spinning and whirling of the cherry goodness didn't look right in the front display of the tank.&nbsp; It had a nice solid core of ice-ness, but around the edges did not look like it was measuring up to the exacting standards of consistency that I expect from a really fine slurpee.&nbsp; However, the diminutive light next to the window that indicates freezing time for the slurpee was off.&nbsp; I was torn.&nbsp; Do I trust the technology in front of me telling me that the slurpee is indeed done and ready for consumption, or to I stick to my intuition and experience and avoid the sweet nectar?&nbsp; Like a fool, I trusted the external sensing over my own deductive abilities.&nbsp; I poured myself a half melted cherry slurpee and was totally disappointed by it.&nbsp; What do we learn?&nbsp; Technology can be deceptive.&nbsp; It is better to rely on the human ability to discern.&nbsp;   Other things of note that happened yesterday:    Tried a white chocolate and almond Hershey bar.&nbsp; Delicious, but only being made for a limited time, so I'm thinking of stockpiling them.  Went to Sarah's parent's house in Denver and hung out with her sisters and mom for a while.&nbsp; Funny family.&nbsp; Her mom is a riot.  Discovered a king sized white chocolate peanut butter cup.&nbsp; The cup was twice the depth of a normal cup with the same diameter. Dreamy  Wore a pair of shoes that I'm pretty sure are out of style now.&nbsp;   Got chided in the temple for talking too loud.  Bought myself a CTR ring for the first time in my life.  Pretended to be thrilled for a friend who is engaged to a guy she's only been dating for a month.  Kicked myself for leaving my new digital camera in the car because the flowers at the temple were just unreal.  Skipped out on going to Chilis with a bunch of people in the ward after the baptisms.&nbsp;   Missed the two calls the mail man attempted to make on the way back to Boulder because my phone was in the back seat on silent.  Called him back at 11:50 pm.  Realized how much I really like him.  Realized he is leaving me in 3 weeks.&nbsp;   Realized I hate bad timing.

       I never write anything really interesting in this blog.&nbsp; Lately it has just been a report of what happens to me every day.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I really don't think it is all that interesting to record the minutiae of what happens to me every day.&nbsp; From now on I will try to limit myself to significant events that happen, or interesting thought that cross my mind.&nbsp; If you want to know what's really going on with me, you can email me or even call.&nbsp;   My friend at work made me a copy of his mixed CD.&nbsp; He is really proud of his CD creating ability.&nbsp; Granted, it is cool when you put together a mix that has just the right feel, and every track builds on the one before it to make it a cohesive piece, but its not like you wrote the music.&nbsp; I don't understand how one can take so much pride in putting together a CD, but he does.&nbsp;   I went to lunch with friends today.&nbsp; I had a crush on this guy at work a year ago, and I haven't seen him in months. He was at the lunch and when I looked at him and talked to him for a while I was mystified by the realization that I was ever even slightly attracted to him.&nbsp; What did I see in him? Maybe he's changed, maybe I have, but now I have no attraction to him at all.&nbsp; It is weird&nbsp;when you look back at the people&nbsp; you were interested in and you are completely confused by your old self's taste in the opposite sex.&nbsp; Ya know?  &nbsp;

      On my way home from work last night I decided to take the long way.&nbsp; Actually, since I left work at 4:30, the "long" way is really a short way because I avoid all the traffic of people emptying Boulder.&nbsp; The long way takes me through the country on a little curvey two lane road instead of the turnpike.&nbsp; As I was driving out of town I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the place I live.&nbsp; Every day I am so lucky to be living in a place that is awe inspiring.&nbsp; I decided to pull over and hike in the foothills for a while. I took my new digital camera (thanks mom) and my real camera.&nbsp; I took the same picture with both cameras so that I can see the difference.&nbsp; I think that I'll be using my digital more to take funny pictures of people, and my real camera to take pretty pictures of nature and outdoors stuff.&nbsp; I didn't like using the view screen to try to get pictures of the mountains.   I came home and I was totally alone.&nbsp; It made me so happy to just make myself some scrambled eggs, put in on of my favorite CDs and just enjoy not talking to anyone.   &nbsp;  Then,&nbsp;I went to see Napoleon Dynamite.&nbsp; OH MY GOODNESS it was funny.&nbsp; I just cracked up laughing the whole time.&nbsp; Maybe it was because I went in expecting it to be lame, and I was pleasantly surprised, but I thought it was great.&nbsp; And, I went with new people which is always cool.&nbsp;   After the movie I went to the mail man's house.&nbsp; A couple of other people were over, and the bunch of us played games.&nbsp; I won one round, so I was happy.&nbsp; After everyone left I made my way out to my car.&nbsp; He walked me out.&nbsp; We stood around and talked by my car for 2 hours.&nbsp; He is the greatest.&nbsp; I hate BYU for taking him away.&nbsp; This is lame.   If you can't tell from this post, I am exhausted.&nbsp; I need more than 4 hours of sleep to function well.&nbsp;

      So today there was an interesting post on my sister's ex-boyfriend's blog.&nbsp; If you want to check it out, I've linked it  urlLink here .&nbsp;Usually I&nbsp;would never expose someone's extremely personal feelings, but this kid is the biggest creep I've met in a long time.   Anyway, for an entire year my sister gave this kid her whole heart and he played with it like a little boy with a new transformer.&nbsp; The thought it was cool, but as soon as he took it out to school he saw that other little boys had different transformers.&nbsp; Even though his transformer was top of the line, brand new, never been hurt before, he couldn't be satisfied with it.&nbsp; Anyway, he broke her heart.&nbsp; Completely.&nbsp;   I didn't like him from the very first day I met him, and let her know it.&nbsp; One time I threw a birthday party for her.&nbsp; He and his little friend showed up late, made me make more food for them, were loud and obnoxious, and annoyed all the other guests.   When they started dating, I decided to give him a chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was rude to my family (he called my uncle a leprechaun), desecrated the hallowed sanctuary of "grandma's house" and was just annoying.&nbsp; Anyway, I still tried to give him the benefit of the doubt because my sister has pretty good taste in people,&nbsp;so I thought there must be something redeeming about the kid.&nbsp; I was wrong.   Anyway, it took her a really long time to get over him.&nbsp; This summer she has met a great guy, and they have been dating seriously.&nbsp; She is head over heels for him, and even my dad thinks he might be "the one."&nbsp;   I guess he found out about her new boyfriend and realized what a good thing he had.   The post left by her ex-boyfriend is a declaration of his love to her.&nbsp;   He is the most selfish person on the planet.&nbsp;   If he really loved her he would only want her to be happy.&nbsp; He would see that Dan makes her happy and not try to manipulate her emotions to get her to come back to him.&nbsp;   I know how he feels because someone I loved got engaged only 3 months after we stopped seeing each other.&nbsp; Did I confess my love for him?&nbsp; No, I said I was happy to hear that he had found someone new, and I really was.&nbsp; When I hung up I cried the hottest tears I&nbsp;had since I was a little girl.   All I can say is that ANYONE would be a better brother-in-law than that kid.&nbsp; Thinking of him fills my heart with a disturbing amount of anger.&nbsp;   News to the world:&nbsp; DON'T MESS WITH MAGGIE UNLESS YOU CAN HANDLE THE WRATH OF HER SISTER!   &nbsp;

      Last night Eric took me to the Incubus concert for my birthday.&nbsp; It was AWESOME!&nbsp; I really love that band.&nbsp; Brandon Boyd is a little weird, but for the show it was great!&nbsp; I knew almost every song (they played some from back in the day when I didn't listen to them yet).&nbsp; They played Drive, which was the song that introduced the band to me.&nbsp; In the middle they dropped out all the instrumentals and two voices just harmonized and counterpointed the melody.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; Plus, it was great to go with Eric.&nbsp; He is the best, and except for one awkward moment when we leant toward each other a little too close to hear what the other person was saying, everything felt completely platonic and fun.&nbsp; I don't know why, but sometimes that kid can still make my stomach do a flip flop if he looks at me right.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't think that means I'm not over him, I think it means that I still think he's attractive, which is true.&nbsp; I mean, the kid is hot.   I was going to go waterskiing before the show, but a storm decided to roll through during the precise hour I was out on the lake.&nbsp; Bummer.  Tonight I&nbsp;am going to bed early.&nbsp; I have to, I'm just exhausted.&nbsp; Maybe I have mono.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      All I can say is WOAH about this weekend!   Friday night the party went off without a hitch.&nbsp; Sarah, Colin, Amy W, Eric T, Erik G, Amy G and I all went out for dinner ( I had a mushroom burger....yummmm). Then, we all met up with a bunch of people at the roller skating rink.&nbsp; There were so many kids in middle school it was unreal.&nbsp; It was almost painful to see the rampant insecurity and know exactly how they felt and what they were thinking and going through.&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp; I wouldn't go back to being that age for anything in the world.&nbsp; Anyway, I used my awesome purple puma rollerskates and was doing pretty well.&nbsp; I was even doing pretty well going backwards on them until this kid wasn't watching and totally took me out.&nbsp; I was pretty annoyed at that.&nbsp; The mail man and I skated for a bit, but intentionally avoided the "couples" skate.&nbsp; Lame.&nbsp; After skating, everyone went back to my house for cake.&nbsp; It was really cool.&nbsp; Having a bunch of mormons over for a party can either be really fun or really lame.&nbsp; Because there isn't any alcohol, people have a hard time loosening up.&nbsp; Anyway, we all took shots of this really nasty juice that my roommate Amy's step mom gave her.&nbsp; The party was a complete success.&nbsp; At one point I looked around and everyone in the room seemed to be talking and laughing.&nbsp; It really made me happy.&nbsp; Actually, all except for Colin who fell asleep on the floor.&nbsp; I guess every party needs a pooper, but.....   Saturday was another great day.&nbsp; I woke up at 10 and stayed in bed reading until noon.&nbsp; Glorious!&nbsp; Then, I spent the rest of the afternoon doing a serious cleaning job on the house, and making nanimo bars.&nbsp; If you have never tried this delectable treat you haven't really lived.&nbsp; They are my absolute favorite, and totally remind me of going to Lindamens in high school with Brooke.&nbsp;   At 5 our ward had a luau.&nbsp; It was supposed to be outside at a pool, but the weather was crappy, so they moved it inside.&nbsp; It was pretty lame, and the rice they made was WAY funky.&nbsp; I got to talk to this kid, Matt.&nbsp; He is really nice and I would have a pretty serious crush on the kid if I weren't so into the mail man.&nbsp; He plays the jazz piano and played the violin all growing up.&nbsp; Yet, he still manages to be good at sports.&nbsp; Pretty impressive in my book.&nbsp; The mail man decided to go climbing instead of supporting the ward activity.&nbsp; I don't really blame him because if I hadn't already committed to going I probably would have just stayed home or something.&nbsp;   After the luau, I hung out with the mail man.&nbsp; We challenged Amy and Erik to a skee-ball tournament at Chuck E Cheese.&nbsp; We lost, but not by much. He locked his keys in his car at the climbing gym, so we had to go out to Thorton to get them.&nbsp; After that we were going to make cookies at my house, but I didn't have any brown sugar, so we decided we'd do it on Sunday.&nbsp; We watched a movie.&nbsp; I realized with greater and greater clarity how much I like this kid and how much it will suck when he leaves.   Sunday church was pretty good.&nbsp; The talks were interesting.&nbsp; Erik gave one on "the power of determination," which seems a little redundant to me.&nbsp; The mail man came up to gospel essentials with me and sat by me.&nbsp; I thought that was a really good sign and kind of a boyfriend-y thing to do. Class was rough, and I fell asleep for 10 minutes of Relief Society.&nbsp; I made a new friend in RS, so I count that as a worthwhile reason to have gone.   After church the mail man, and his brother and I hung out in the parking lot for a while.&nbsp; I had to open my trunk to get the directions to the jam session I was going to, and Zane, the mail man's brother, saw my golf clubs.&nbsp; He went nuts and started getting them out and swinging them around in the parking lot.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp;   I went down to the jam session at my fiddling teacher's house in Denver.&nbsp; It was awesome!&nbsp; I played pretty well for my first time ever.&nbsp; It was so cool. I just sat around with about 4 guitarists backing me up.&nbsp; I did fairly well, but I'm still going to have to practice before the contest in two weeks.&nbsp; After all the students played, my teacher and her band (gypsy swing review) started playing.&nbsp; OH MY GOSH!&nbsp; They were awesome.&nbsp; I could have sat there and listened to them all day.&nbsp; I really wish I could play like that.&nbsp; I had to leave at around 5, so I said my farewell to my teacher (she is moving to Idaho), and didn't mention the last lesson that I had paid&nbsp; $35 for and didn't receive.   Came home, crashed for an hour, went to Eric's house for dinner.&nbsp; We made pizza and tried to get Brett to let us spray whipped cream on his newly shaved head. Then, at 9:30 I went home and called the mail man.&nbsp; He was still up for making cookies, so he came over and we started.&nbsp; I licked the beater clean of batter, and promptly felt sick.&nbsp; I don't know what it could have been?&nbsp; I mean it is totally strange to get sick from eating 5 nanimo bars, a whole strip of brownies from a 9X13 pan, a beater of cookie dough, hommade pizza and chips and salsa!&nbsp; Spent the night curled up in a ball on the couch talking to the mail man while he rubbed my back.&nbsp; Yea for nice boys who try to make you feel better when you have totally gorged yourself on treats.&nbsp; Goal for the day:&nbsp; NO SUGAR!

      Just to let you all know, I have the best friends on the planet.&nbsp; You might think that your friends are cool and thoughtful and the best ever, but you are wrong. Mine are the best.&nbsp;   Special things my friends have done for me already this morning:   1) Derek called me from Pennsylvania to wish me a happy birthday. (this meant SO much to me, I don't know why)  2) Colin and Sarah showed up at my house and made me birthday pancakes just like my parents did.  3) I got into work and Colin decorated my cube to the nines.&nbsp; There are streamers hanging from the ceiling, balloons covering the floor and rainbow confetti EVERYwhere.&nbsp; The custodian is going to HATE me.  4) Sarah, Colin and Amy Sue bought me a pair of pink and purple puma rollerskates for me to wear to the party tonight.&nbsp;   When I walked down stairs this morning and saw the birthday pancakes I just lost it.&nbsp; I haven't&nbsp;felt to appreciated in a really long time and I just started tearing up. It seems like you go on with your day to day life and think that people are too wrapped up in their own lives to really notice, because that's how you are.&nbsp; Then, something like this happens and it just makes you realize things, you know?&nbsp; Anyway, have a great day. I wish you all could come to my rollerskating party tonight to see my new skates in action!

      I know there is really no such thing as "birthday eve" in the normal world, but this is katieland where anything goes.   If someone were reading this blog and seeing what a big deal I am making about my birthday they might think I am a little obsessed or crazy, but you have to understand where I'm coming from.&nbsp; Birthdays at my house are a HUGE deal.&nbsp; The day starts out with birthday pancakes.&nbsp; This means that my dad makes a towering stack of dinner plate sized pancakes.&nbsp; My mom puts candles in the stack, lights them, is joined by the rest of my family singing happy birthday, and then slices the pancakes into wedges like a normal cake.&nbsp; This is a really important tradition.&nbsp; In march I drove over to Utah so that I could make my sister birthday pancakes for her birthday.&nbsp; Its that big of a deal.&nbsp; All day long the phone is ringing off the hook from my aunt and grandma calling about every hour to sing happy birthday to me.&nbsp; We go out to dinner, and then usually have a big party.&nbsp; Every single year of my life (except when I've been away from home) I've had a pinata filled with candy and treats.&nbsp; Even into high school.&nbsp; This being my "Golden Birthday" they've already started the celebration.&nbsp; Last Friday my aunt started calling and wishing me a happy birthday week.&nbsp; My grandma called from Alaska, even though she doesn't get reception and all I heard was static and every 9th word.&nbsp; My mom called this morning and left me a voice mail wishing me happy birthday.&nbsp; Now you understand why I am a little obsessed.   Yesterday I got stood up for my last fiddling lesson. I was way bummed.&nbsp; I had practiced really hard and was totally ready for a great last lesson.&nbsp; I gathered my fiddle, tapes, and antiquated tape recorder in my excited hands and made my way to her door.&nbsp; As I glanced into her slightly translucent window I caught a glimpse that confused me.&nbsp; Every other week the student before me was a 30 something guy who looked like he could work at inateck as a computer programmer.&nbsp; Today as I peered in for a closer look it was a 40 something housewife looking woman who was playing a cello.&nbsp; Curious?&nbsp; I stood before the door for a minute and then decided to knock and walk in.&nbsp; I was greeted by my teacher's roommate (who I had heard crazy stories about).&nbsp; She informed me that my teacher was out of town and apologized for the miscommunication.&nbsp; I turned around dejectedly.&nbsp; I felt hurt, rejected, forgotten. (not really, this is just me taking some literary liberty to make the story better).   I hopped back in my car and raced home.&nbsp; I was planning on leaving straight from my lesson to meet Sarah and Michele in Denver to go to a comedy show.&nbsp; Getting my lesson cancelled afforded me a solid 30 minutes to nap.&nbsp; This week has been the "stay up WAY too late, realize you are really cool and have a great social life, but pay for it with a splitting headache in the morning" week.   While I was napping my friend Calvin called to wish me a happy birthday.&nbsp; I was floored that he even remembered it.&nbsp; My first reaction was to try to figure out how who had reminded him about it.&nbsp; I thought there was no way he would just remember on his own.&nbsp; I tried to think up elaborate ways he could have talked to someone who talked to someone else who told him not to forget.&nbsp; Then I realized I was being retarded and just gave him the benefit of the doubt that he actually remembered on his own and actually cared about me.&nbsp; That made me feel much better.   I drove down to Denver and met up with Sarah and Michele.&nbsp; The comedy show was really funny and I had a great time hanging out with both of them.&nbsp; They are the type of girls who are just fun to hang out with.&nbsp; They never say mean catty things about other people, they are smart and can hold an interesting conversation, they don't dominate and talk about themselves, and they can tell a great story.&nbsp; Just good people.   I didn't get home until late...Again.&nbsp; Now my head is pounding and I am wondering how long I can last at work.&nbsp; My friends are taking me out for lunch at 11:30. I'm sure I can make it until then.

      Last night I hung out with work friends, and it was REALLY fun.&nbsp; We all had BBQ and played games.&nbsp; It was really cool. I made my world famous spinach and pear salad, which was appropriately appreciated by everyone who tasted it.&nbsp;   After the games Sarah came over and we hung out for a little while.&nbsp; That girl is so cool.&nbsp;   I didn't even talk to the mail man yesterday, and I am fine with that.&nbsp; I REALLY like how things are going with him.&nbsp; Slow and steady, no big bumps.&nbsp; It is wonderful.&nbsp;   I talked with Eric on the phone yesterday and we both decided that all the drama is over.&nbsp; We are back to just being normal.&nbsp; What a relief!   I just went to talk to my lead at the new position I am starting and he seems really nice.&nbsp; I think I'll be able to do a really good job for him.&nbsp; I don't know much about the new area I'll be working in, but he wants me to make decision and figure stuff out on my own, which is great!&nbsp; I think I'll actually learn how to be a better engineer, and maybe it will help me realize what I want to study in grad school.&nbsp;   Today is the day of optimism and good feelings, so go out there and spread it around.&nbsp;

      At 2:45 pm yesterday my phone rang.&nbsp; It was Sarah saying that she was done working in the lab and ready to take me shopping.&nbsp; Lately&nbsp; I have been on a clothes buying rampage.&nbsp; I think this spree is a result of two main impetuses. First, I don't have a washing machine handy, so I am rapidly running out of clean clothes and second, wearing a new outfit makes me feel more attractive and I'm trying to work it with the mail man.&nbsp; Anyway, lethal combination.&nbsp; I threw all my cubicle stuff into two boxes, packed up my computer and labeled everything for my&nbsp; move in 7 minutes and was out the door.&nbsp; I met Sarah at her house and we went to Pearl street.&nbsp; She found this really cool store and we did a mad dash, because we only had enough change for 18 minutes on the parking meter.&nbsp; I got a really cute white skirt with a big pink flower on it, and Sarah almost bought a cool pair of black and white shoes but she had restraint.&nbsp; Impressive.  &nbsp;  After our mad rushed shopping, I came back to my house to get ready for the Rockies game.&nbsp; I felt retarded "getting ready" for a baseball game, but I knew the mail man was going to be there and I still feel like I need to look my best around him.&nbsp; I drove down to the game with Colin, Eric and Brett.&nbsp; It was good to be with them. It felt right.&nbsp; It felt normal.&nbsp; I was happy. Because I am on the FHE committee, I had a reserved parking spot right across the street from the stadium.&nbsp; It was the parking spot of my dreams.&nbsp; Really, there wasn't a closer lot we could have parked in.&nbsp; It was great.  &nbsp;  We got our tickets, and took our seats.&nbsp; Now, I really don't like to watch baseball and I find it even harder to get into the game if you can hardly see the people playing.&nbsp; Our seats were the very farthest away.&nbsp; Although, since they were free I can't really complain. The mail man was a little late, since he worked until 6:30.&nbsp; He called me as soon as he got to the stadium and I told him how to get his ticket and get in.&nbsp; When he got up to the stands I was talking with Colin, so I didn't really see him right away.&nbsp; When I turned around there he was and my stomach jumped all the way up to the mile high seats in the stadium.&nbsp; He was sitting on the bench next to me, but there was a space between us.&nbsp; Just then, his sister came over and sat in between us.&nbsp; UGH!&nbsp; We talked for a while, but the mail man didn't say anything to me and I was getting a little frustrated.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In an effort to calm down and just let it go, I decided to find a Pepsi.&nbsp; As I was leaving our nosebleed seats, I saw a lady holding a Pepsi bottle, so I assumed you can get them in the stadium.&nbsp; WRONG.&nbsp; I walked around the whole stadium looking for that delicious nectar that would soothe my rumpled feathers.&nbsp; I had to settle with a coke.&nbsp; Gross.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I got my soda and was walking back up the stands. I turned into my row and what befell my eyes, but the mailman with his ex-girlfriend sitting on the bleacher in front of him, leaning back into his open legs.&nbsp; I was instantly enraged.&nbsp; I felt betrayed and played and tricked.&nbsp; Why had I let him get to me so quickly when he was obviously just a player who didn't look at me as anything but a diversion until he can get back to school.&nbsp; I was really hurt.&nbsp; The guys I was with were typical guys and didn't know how to truly help me fuel the fire within.&nbsp; If Sarah had been there she would have been so mad for me her wrath would have been uncontrollable.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In the 6th inning the three boys left me to go walk around and pee, so I was left alone.&nbsp; The mail man and I chatted a little, but I could feel that I was being cold and distant.&nbsp; It sucked.  &nbsp;  The mail man and his sister left in the bottom of the 6th because some of her friends were at Cheesecake factory just down the street and she wanted to go say hi.&nbsp; He wouldn't let her wander downtown Denver by herself.&nbsp; That was nice.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The boys got back and I was miserable, so we left between the top and bottom of the 7th.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was so mad on the drive home, but was able to keep it in until I had dropped off the guys.&nbsp; When they got out of the car I just let it go.&nbsp; Tears were running down my cheeks like a deluge.&nbsp; I was so tired of letting people into my heart just to have them trample all over it.&nbsp; I really needed to talk to someone, and the first person that came to mind was Eric.&nbsp; As I was reaching over to my phone, it rang and it was him.&nbsp; He knew I wasn't OK and called to tell me that I'm cool and that he was there if I needed anything.&nbsp; It meant so much to me to have him say he was there for me.&nbsp; All I really needed was a hug and for someone to tell me that (1) the mail man was a retard and (2) I am cool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I got home took a bath and then saw that the mail man had texted me.&nbsp; It said:  &nbsp;  "why'd you leave, you fair weather fan" (because the Rockies were loosing 12-2)  &nbsp;  I had calmed down a little.  &nbsp;  I tested back:  &nbsp;  "I wasn't really into the game, plus I felt really stupid."  &nbsp;  He tried to call, but I wasn't feeling like talking.&nbsp; He left a message that said to call. Then he texted:  &nbsp;  "why?"&nbsp; (Like he didn't know)  &nbsp;  I replied:  &nbsp;  "Lots of reasons"  &nbsp;  He replied  &nbsp;  "Anything I can do?&nbsp; I don't want you to feel dumb."  &nbsp;  I replied  &nbsp;  "Nothing you can do, just dumb girl stuff."  &nbsp;  Then he called me and asked why I felt stupid.&nbsp; In that instant I just decided to stop messing around and be honest.&nbsp; No games.&nbsp; I said, "well, I really like you mailman and I just felt like..."  &nbsp;  Then he said he was coming over and we could go get a frosty together.&nbsp; Good, I hate the phone.  &nbsp;  He got to my house in record time and we drove over to wendy's.&nbsp; We talked about everything under the sun except the conversation we started having on the phone.&nbsp; We got back to my house and ate our frosty dairy desserts.&nbsp; We finally got around to me saying that I felt retarded because when I walked up the stairs and saw her between his legs all flirty.&nbsp; He said that none of that was initiated by him, and when she did it he didn't know what to do and he was worried about me coming back and seeing them like that and what message that would send.&nbsp; He apologized for any awkwardness.&nbsp; It was perfect, and exactly what Colin had guessed happened.&nbsp; It was like at my birthday last year when all Colin wanted to do was talk to Sarah, but Gabby kept getting in the way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, the mail man and I stayed up until 2:30 talking again.&nbsp; I am crazy about this kid!&nbsp; We kind of talked about what was happening and we regretted the bad timing (since he's leaving so soon).&nbsp; We decided that we would hang out for the next month, and then when he comes back for winter break we'd go skiing together.&nbsp;Timing is everything.&nbsp; Why couldn't I have met him while we both were in Provo and we could actually date?&nbsp; Now we are doing this kind of strange half dating, despite both of our better judgments.&nbsp;

      Caveat Emptor:&nbsp; This post will probably illustrate just how overdramatic and strange I am.&nbsp; Just thought you should be warned.  &nbsp;  Friday I left work early because I had nothing to do.&nbsp; My company picnic started at 4 in the afternoon, and I wasn't really planning on going due to the torrential downpour, but Colin called and informed me that it was still on.&nbsp; I'm not really one to pass on a free meal, so I decided I'd meet him there. It was pretty rainy, but it was still nice.&nbsp; Sarah came for a few minutes, but had to go to work.&nbsp; Colin an I just ended up talking the whole time we were there.&nbsp; I don't really like going to work functions because its the same people I see every day and outside of work there really isn't much to talk about.&nbsp; Anyway, it was just pouring down rain by the time we wanted to leave.&nbsp; It was interesting to watch all the little kids play in the rain.&nbsp; They would stand just inside the protection of the covered picnic table area and lean out until the water that ran off the top fell onto their outstretched tongues.&nbsp; If I'd had a camera and were a photographer there would have been some really amazing moments caught on film.&nbsp; I remember being that little kid who was just enthralled by rain.&nbsp; What happens to us as we grow up and see a rainstorm as merely an inconvenience?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After getting home and drying off a little I made some brownies for the BBQ that my friend Amy was having.&nbsp; I'll have to admit that I made brownies for two reasons.&nbsp; First, the mail man loves brownies and I invited him to go to the BBQ with me, so I thought I'd win some points there.&nbsp; Second, Eric was the one who invited me to the BBQ, and the kind of brownies with the big chocolate chip chunks are his favorite.&nbsp; I thought it might make him feel good to think that I made them for him.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, the BBQ was supposed to start around 7:30 or 8.&nbsp; The mail man called me at 7:30 to tell me that he'd be late because traffic coming home from work was a nightmare.&nbsp; Ok, annoying, but understandable.&nbsp; At 8 he called and asked me if his sister could come with us.&nbsp; I was again annoyed because I wanted some time alone with him.&nbsp; Anyway, they showed up at my house at 8:15 and we left. I forgot the brownies.&nbsp; We got to the party house and no one was there.&nbsp; I was really confused, but we decided to go out bowling with some other people.&nbsp; I was pretty hurt that they just forgot about me and didn't tell me what was going on. At around 9 Colin called me and told me that the party had moved to another house.&nbsp; Colin is my real friend.&nbsp; He is considerate and would never let me down.  &nbsp;  I&nbsp;didn't really feel like driving all the way back down there, plus we were already set on bowling, so I just decided to not hang out with them.&nbsp; At bowling the mailman paid a ton of attention to me.&nbsp; Yea!&nbsp; Plus, I broke 100 and had 2 strikes in a row.&nbsp; Pretty amazing huh?!?  &nbsp;  After bowling a big group went out to the mailman's house and played a pool game called CRUD.&nbsp; The mail man's ankle was still jacked up, so he didn't play.&nbsp; We played ping pong and I didn't do too poorly.&nbsp; By 1 am everyone had left but me, since I didn't drive there.&nbsp; The mail man realized that he needed to drive me home.&nbsp; We got into the car and talked the whole way home.&nbsp; When we got to my house he just stopped to let me out.&nbsp; My confusion was ended by that move.&nbsp; Clearly, if he was interested in me he would have at least parked and talked more, or walked me to my door or something.&nbsp; I into my house really disappointed.&nbsp; I got ready for bed and as I was setting my alarm clock I noticed that he had called me twice.&nbsp; I called him back at at 1:30 in the morning we talked for half an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said he was going to drive his car out to where I live right then because he needed gas, and it is about 20 cents cheaper by my house.&nbsp; He asked if I wanted to go.&nbsp; I told him I was already in my bed.&nbsp; This move really confused me.&nbsp; If he liked me why did he slow down just enough to let me bail out of his car at the drop off.&nbsp; If he doesn't like me, why would he call me at 1 in the morning to see if I wanted to go on a gas run with him?&nbsp; Strange boys.  &nbsp;  Saturday I slept in, something I haven't done in FOREVER.&nbsp; When I woke up, I just laid in bed reading until 11.&nbsp; It was glorious.&nbsp; I love starting out a day like that.&nbsp; I finished  True Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister .&nbsp; It was pretty good, and the author has a really interesting writing style.  &nbsp;  I rolled out of bed,&nbsp;and realize how&nbsp;hurt I&nbsp;had been&nbsp;by getting ditched the night before.&nbsp; Amy called and apologized for how things turned out, so&nbsp;my hurt ego was instantly appeased.&nbsp; But, I was&nbsp;still really mad at Eric.&nbsp; He was the one who had invited me to the&nbsp;thing in the first place, and then he didn't even&nbsp;care when I didn't show up?&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, he knows me well enough to know that getting ditched&nbsp;by my friends is a fear I have.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp;that added to&nbsp;a whole week of being conviently omitted from&nbsp; his plans started to&nbsp;wear on me.&nbsp; I started thinking that he was an inconsiderate&nbsp;person and I didn't really need the headache that went with trying to be his friend.&nbsp; I drove over to his house and gave him the concert tickets that I bought for us back when we were together.&nbsp; I told him that I&nbsp;had been really hurt by his&nbsp;actions the past week and he had proved to me that he didn't really want to be my friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;I told him he could have the tickets and I was done&nbsp;working on being his friend.&nbsp; I left and&nbsp;felt so good the whole way home&nbsp;because I realized that all that effort that I've been putting&nbsp;into trying to be&nbsp;his friend was now over.&nbsp; I laughed out&nbsp;loud&nbsp;because I was able to release all that pressure.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I got home I got in the shower and got ready for the day.&nbsp; When I was done, I had a message on my phone from Eric.&nbsp; He accused me of being too immature to answer the phone (he had a point) and that he hoped some day we would be able to talk things over like grown ups.&nbsp; He said he wasn't going to the show unless it was with me, so I could just have the tickets back.&nbsp; I called him and we talked things out.&nbsp; I apologized for over reacting and he apologized for being inconsiderate.&nbsp; I think things will be better now.&nbsp; I hope they will.&nbsp; We're still going to the concert together, so that's good.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning my house and making an apple pie.&nbsp; The house looked great, the pie was kind of crap.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  At 5 I went to the park and played ultimate Frisbee again.&nbsp; It wasn't as fun as last week, but I still played really well.&nbsp; I'm actually getting pretty good at that game, which is exciting.&nbsp; I played with no shoes and the ground was really wet.&nbsp; Kind of gross, but still pretty fun.&nbsp; This kid named Matt Bulter came to play.&nbsp; He was really nice and funny and plays jazz piano.&nbsp; We got to talking about music and I told him that Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday were my favorites and he said that he'd been listening to Ella on the way over to the game.&nbsp; INTRIGUING.&nbsp; If I wasn't fully smitten by the mailman I know I would have a crush on this kid.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After the game, I met my friend Derek in Boulder for a benefit concert.&nbsp; It was an AMAZING show.&nbsp; The first group was a fiddler from Boston.&nbsp; She was really good, had an amazing voice and made me want to go home and practice.&nbsp; Her group sounded a lot like nickel creek, except substitute an upright bass for the mandolin.&nbsp; The second act was a blues guitarist.&nbsp; I was awesome.&nbsp; To warm up the crowd they played Come Together by the Beatles.&nbsp; It was cool because it was all instrumental until they pointed to the audience and we sang "over me."&nbsp; It was really fun.&nbsp; The only downer was that everyone got up to dance on the floor in the front, and the guy I was with didn't want to dance.&nbsp; Too bad, I love dancing and I really wanted to get up there, but I felt dumb going by myself and I felt like I would have been a bad friend to just leave him sitting there by himself.&nbsp; The last act was the one we had really come to see.&nbsp; It was Alana Davis.&nbsp; She did a great job!&nbsp; I was really impressed by the whole show.&nbsp; It was really diverse, but kind of all blended together.&nbsp; I told the mail man that I thought the show would be out by 11,&nbsp; and he told me to give him a call afterward.&nbsp; Well, with encores and stuff it didn't get out until after midnight.&nbsp; I still called him and he said he wasn't tired, so he came over to my house.&nbsp; We stayed up until 4 am talking and laughing.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; Good news: I am completely crazy about this kid, and I'm pretty sure he likes me too.&nbsp; Bad news:&nbsp; What happens now?  &nbsp;  Sunday I rolled out of bed at 8 am (yes, that is after only 4 hours of sleep) and got to church on time.&nbsp; I made it all the way to the end of the third hour and totally fell asleep.&nbsp; Sarah invited me to go on a hike after church, and it was the perfect day, but I just couldn't stay awake for one more moment.&nbsp; The mail man followed me home from church to get a brownie.&nbsp; Then, I went to sleep. I slept from 2-4.&nbsp; Then, I read for a while and practiced my fiddle.&nbsp; At 6 I called the mail man and we decided that I'd go to the BBQ that Amy was having at 7 and he'd eat dinner with his family.&nbsp; Then, we'd hang out afterward.&nbsp; He didn't want to stay out late because he had stayed out every night last week and it had made going to his work really hard.&nbsp; I said that was fine.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I went to&nbsp;Amy's house for the BBQ.&nbsp; It was rad.&nbsp; I love those people.&nbsp; Eric was there and things between us felt normal again.&nbsp; I was totally relieved.&nbsp; I realized that I was the main catalyst for any hard feelings between us.&nbsp; If I'm laid back and normal, he takes his cue from me and everything is fine.&nbsp; Things only get weird when I overreact and act like a crazy person.&nbsp; Colin made his AWESOME salsa.&nbsp; I could eat it with a spoon.&nbsp; It has chunks of avacado and mango in it.&nbsp; Dreamy.&nbsp; Anyway, I stayed there until 9.&nbsp; I was the first one to leave and I felt really weird getting up and leaving.&nbsp; I've never been the one to do that, like I've got somewhere more important to be or something.&nbsp; I felt like a jerk, and when I left I caught a look on Eric's face that kind of made me feel bad.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, I headed back to my house.&nbsp; Amy, Erik, the mail man and I played 3 rounds of clue (all of which Erik won), and a game of Nerts (which I dominated at).&nbsp; Then, Erik left and it was just the mail man and I again.&nbsp; We sat on the couch and talked and we listened to some Spanish music that I'd never heard, but he really liked.&nbsp; We cuddled and held hands and just laughed.&nbsp; This is my favorite time in a friendship.&nbsp; When everything is new, but you're sure that the other person is just as excited to be with you and you are to be with them.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm really crazy about this guy.&nbsp; I love spending time with him because he is so interesting.&nbsp; We have totally different interests, but that is what makes it cool because I can talk about what I like, and he can teach me about what he likes.&nbsp; It really works out great.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tonight we are going to a Colorado Rockies game for FHE.&nbsp; There are going to be about 65 kids going to this thing.&nbsp; I'm way excited.&nbsp; I'm driving down with Eric, so that will be good to spend that time together.&nbsp; I really like being his friend and I want him to know that I care about him.&nbsp; I know he doesn't know where he fits into the picture what with the mail man and all, but I want him to know that I still love hanging out with him and I want him to feel free to call me up any time to talk or hang out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I was reading my friend  urlLink Loyd's  blog this morning. I was about to comment on his post entitled "All I want for Christmas is..." and say that there are lots of girls who can be consistent for a few days, lumping myself into that desirable category.&nbsp; Then, I read back through&nbsp;my posts just from this last week and I realized that, if those girls do exist I am for sure not one of them.&nbsp; I'm all over the place.&nbsp; No wonder guys have such a hard time trying to figure us out.&nbsp; We are random and unpredictable and often erratic.&nbsp; All I can say is, that is the nature of the game guys.&nbsp; You've gotta take the good with the bad.&nbsp;

      Since it seems like a bunch of my friends are getting engaged recently, I've been thinking about what kind of proposal I would be impressed by.&nbsp; I think I might want a little more than what my mom got (my dad tossed the box in her lap and said "what do you think?" when she opened it, the diamond wasn't even in a ring setting yet, but still in the earing setting he bought it in), but I don't really need what my friend Katie just had (she and her bf flew out to NY, and he asked her on the Fourth of July on top of the totally deserted empire state building).  urlLink This story  cracked me up and made me realize that there is a lid for every pot.

      For the past couple of days I've really been feeling bored.&nbsp; Life seems to be stuck in a rut of a routine and nothing really changes.&nbsp; I need a challenge.&nbsp; Something that motivates me, and I just don't seem to have that right now.&nbsp; Hopefully this move at work on Tuesday will help.&nbsp; With any luck I will feel completely incompetent and that will get me into gear and excited to learn something new.&nbsp; This kind of feeling happens pretty regularly every 6-8 months, and I don't really know how to change it.&nbsp; Usually I just plough through and things get better.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This morning I don't even really care about how things are going with the mail man.&nbsp; He is cool, but what's the point?&nbsp; He's going back to Provo in a month where he will undoubtedly find the girl of his dreams and I'll be a faint memory.&nbsp; Is it really worth getting myself all involved with someone who won't do the same for me?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Tonight is my work summer picnic, but I'm seriously considering not going.&nbsp; Its pretty much just a chance for everyone to stand around a keg of beer and talk about work.&nbsp; I don't drink, and I don't like talking about work when I'm not there.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Later my friend Amy is having a BBQ.&nbsp; That should be fun.&nbsp; Sarah is back from Mexico, so it will be good to catch up and hear all her stories.&nbsp; I stopped by her work last night to see her and chat for a while, but she had to keep helping customers, so that put a damper on our convo.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Saturday I'm going to a concert at the Boulder Theater.&nbsp; It is going to be filled with hippies that reek of pot, but I already bought the tickets so I'm going.&nbsp; The only thing I'm looking forward to doing this weekend is playing Frisbee on Saturday.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sorry about the funk I'm in this morning, but everyone is entitled to a down day once in a while, right?

      I know a lot of people think that they have great families, and they probably do.  Some families are great, but mine is the BEST...hands down!  For a year I've been taking fiddling lessons just as a way to learn something new and to not waste all the time and money that has been put into my musical education.  On August 7 there is a contest that my teacher told me I should sign up for.  I thought about it and decided what the heck.  Well, I told my family I was going to do it, and my parents decided to fly down here to watch me play.  How cool is that?!?!?    So my crush on the mail man grows DAILY.  Last night I woke up in the middle of the night and just smiled thinking about him.  I haven't felt this way about a guy since Derek in college.  He is just so interesting to talk to.  Also, this is big, he scraped off the orange numbers that have been on my windshield for WAY too long.  Last October I was in Provo, and parked my car overnight in my sister's apartment complex parking lot.  Well, if you know Provo, you know the end of this story.  It got towed.  When they tow your car, they use this weird waxy crayon to write down a number to keep the lot organized.  Well, I didn't wash the numbers off right away, and they became a hard, cemented-on feature of my car. I wash my car religiously every Monday afternoon, but (much to my chagrin) the bubble brush and the high pressure soap would not dislodge the identifying numbers.  My ex-boyfriend would always comment on the numbers and I would always make some kind of comment back about him scraping them off to show me how much he cares (this of course was just a joke, but it kept me from actually cleaning them off).  I was floored when last night the mail man grabbed a razor blade, strode casually out to my car and scraped the numbers off in a matter of minutes.  He passed a test I didn't even know I was giving.   The mail man, his brother and I stayed up talking really late last night.  Turns out his brother has NEVER had a girlfriend.  He hasn't even ever really gone on a second date with someone. This kid is 22 years old and still has yet to find anyone he really wanted to seriously date.  How does that happen?  There are SO many interesting people out there. It boggled my mind.  I kind of feel sorry for the first girlfriend because she is going to assume that he knows someone about being in a relationship because he is so old, but he won't know anything.  He'll make all the first-timer mistakes and she'll be so frustrated.    So things with the mail man are heading down a path I know well.  The path of, "I just think you are the greatest girl, and I can tell you are crazy about me, but I just really don't see anything happening." It is a well traveled path for me, dating back to my first death crush, Nate Usher.  This kid completely had me head over heals, but never led me on to think things were going to move in any romantic direction.  Because he acted like a grownup we are still friends to this day. I don't really know what I can do in the situation I am in now other than just roll with whatever comes.

      The skiing yesterday was AMAZING!  It was the first time, after an entire season of attempting last summer that I got up slalom.  Once I got the hang of it, it really wasn't that hard.  I am a skiing champ.  Now I really need my own boat.  Why are toys so expensive?  Coming back to work after spending two glorious hours on the lake was painful.  All afternoon I texted back and forth with the mail man.  He asked me when he could have a rematch with Texas and other kind of flirty things, so that was nice.  At the end of the exchange he said he had to focus on work, so he'd call me later.  That made me happy.  I got home from work and was so tired!  I honestly felt like I had been hit by a truck.  Amy was making dinner for the missionaries and asked if I wanted to join.  I'm not going to turn down home cooked fried chicken, so I said yes.  Even though all I wanted to do was crawl into bed and take a nap, I asked her if there was anything I could do to help her out.  She told me that I looked tired and if I wanted to nap, she would come wake me up when dinner was ready.  All of a sudden an angelic light fell upon her and I realized that she must have been sent from above.  All a tired and hungry person wants to hear is that someone else will wake them from a nap and feed them right away.  It reminded me of my mom a little.    The nap was delicious.  One of those naps that you wake from and it feels like your arms weigh 50 pounds each because every muscle in them is relaxed.  Wonderful.  Dinner was good, except the missionaries stood Amy up.  It was nice to sit and chat with Erik and Amy.  Erik showed me a bunch of card tricks, so that was cool.  After dinner we cleared the table (I did the dishes like the good sponging roommate) and set out the clue board.  I forgot how much I like that game.  It is really pretty fun.  During the first game the mail man called me, but I didn't answer because my phone was upstairs in my room and I was too tired to run.  Between the first and second games I went up and got it. He didn't leave me a message.  I should have got the hint from that.  He was just calling because he said he would, and not because he especially wanted to see me or talk.  Anyway, I was excited to hear his voice (I know this is lame, but its true), so I called him back.  Listening to the promptings of my friends, I invited him over to play games with us.  It was almost 8 and he said that he just got home and was going to shower and eat dinner with his family and stuff, so he didn't know if he was going to come over. I said, "Ok, well if you want to come over you can."  In my mind I was thinking, "That’s cool, he doesn’t like board games.  Don't take this personal, a lot of people don't like games.  Plus, he just sprained his ankle last night so he probably wants to just relax."    Well, Erik really wanted to go out and play mini-golf so he told me to call the mail man back up and ask him to go play golf with us.  I called him back and he said (this is a direct quote), "No, I think I'm going to take the night off."  I said ok and hung up.  I got all upset about that comment, and even when I came into work I was intending this post to be a rant about that excuse, but as I started to type I realize that he has a SPRAINED ANKLE.  Of course he didn't want to walk around on it for 2 hours playing mini golf. I am totally retarded.  Why is it that when someone says something like that my first response is to take it so personally? He wasn't saying that hanging out with me has become some kind of menial task and he needs some time off from me. He just didn’t want to hobble around in the dark. I'm so dumb sometimes.  I got myself all worked up over nothing, plus I probably made him feel bad last night for turning me down.  I'm a total moron.    This morning I woke up and my shoulders and back are just SORE from water skiing.  How lame.  I need to get out on the water more often so I get over this.  On the plus side, I am getting the best tan of my life on my arms this summer from all this outdoor activity.  I mean my arms are seriously not white.  Right now I am wearing the white leather watch that I got back in February.  When I got it, the leather was the same color as my wrist, but now it is decidedly not.  Most of you would still look at my arms and say they were as white as the driven snow, but you have to look at them through a red-head's perspective. In that light, I'm practically Mexican.

      Oh my gosh!    For FHE last night we went ice blocking.  As usual, none of my friends came to the activity.  That is so discouraging.  Ice blocking is a really fun thing, and if they aren't going to come for that, I'm living in a dream world if I think they'll ever come to some other activity.  Although, next week FHE is taking everyone out to the Colorado Rockies baseball game for free.  There are about 65 people signed up to go.  We're going to spend all of our money for the rest of the year on this one activity.  I hope everyone has a good time because that will be the end.  Whatever.   I'm actually really glad I have this calling because it forces me to be outgoing and meet new people.  It is fun to get new friends because they don't disappoint you they way old ones can.   Ice blocking was really fun, but after about 4 runs I gave my block to someone else.  I was talking with this really nice girl, Nikki, and I asked her if I brought my Frisbee over if she'd play with me.  She said yes, so I started walking back to my car.  Just as a rounded the corner I saw the mail man and his sister throwing their Frisbee around.  It was like they'd read my mind and brought theirs, saving me a trek back to my car.  Anyway, Nikki and I joined their game.  He taught me how to throw the Frisbee from the outside, instead of the conventional way from the inside.  I actually got the hang of it pretty quick.  In my past I've always tried to avoid doing things athletic because I've thought I'd be bad at them, but lately I've been giving them a try and it turns out they weren't as hard as I originally thought.  That is a really good lesson for me to have learned.  Anyway, we played Frisbee for a while.  I was dropping every pass, but that’s alright.  I guess the plan was for the mail man to go play hockey with a bunch of people after FHE, but when they asked him if he was going, he told them he wasn't going to.  I know this is probably just wishful thinking, but I thought that the reason he didn't want to play with them was because he wanted to hang out with me.  Probably not the truth, but still nice to think.  We were just about to pack it up and go home when this kid Dwight threw the mail man a really long pass.  He took off running to catch it.  He jumped in the air, caught it, but came down funny on his ankle and just collapsed.  He tried to get up and walk on it, but he fell to the ground.  His sister is in physical therapy school and she diagnosed that he had sprained his ankle.  He was laying there in the grass, so I thought I'd make myself useful, and I ran to get him one of the abandoned ice blocks so he could ice it down.  I thought I was kind of a dumb thing to do, but whenever someone gets hurt I feel like I need to be doing something.  What good can I do just standing around staring?  I also ran and got him his sandals.  He got up and wouldn't let anybody help him walk to his car.  I walked along side him and asked if he was alright.  He said he would be, but he probably wouldn’t be up for anything later that night but watching a movie.  Then, he invited me over to his house to watch a movie.  I was really excited, so I said yes.    I went over to his house and his sister, he and I watched some old Disney movie.  I guess the movie was a family favorite, and I was being tested to see if I could hang.  I am actually a huge fan of the genre, so I fit right in.  As the mailman sat with his foot elevated, and iced down with frozen mixed vegetables I stole glances and him and realized that I was INCREDIBLY attracted to the kid.  His sister went up to her room mid-movie so it was just the two of us that finished it up.  All of my preconceived notions of her maybe not wanting us to get together vanished.  What a cool girl she is to leave us alone.    After the movie ended I got up to leave, but we ended up talking for quite a while.  He paid me the best compliment I could ever get.  He asked me if I played any sports in high school and when I replied with a resounding no, he seemed genuinely surprised.  Then he said, "Really?  Usually girls who didn't play any sports are uncoordinated. You are really athletic for someone who didn't play any sports.  Maybe you should have played in high school, because I bet you'd have done really well." You could have knocked me over with a feather!  I've NEVER been told this in my whole life.  I've always considered myself un-athletic and been kind of insecure about it, so to have someone compliment me like that was AMAZING.  I'm sure he didn't, and doesn't, know how much that comment meant to me, but I will probably always remember it.   No goodnight kiss or hug or anything, but that was alright.  I was just thrilled to have been with him.  So what I thought was just a mild little crush is growing into a full on death crush.    I'm going skiing during lunch today and I wore my swimsuit under my clothes to work today so that I wouldn’t waste any precious time I could be out on the water.  My goal today is to get up on one ski.  I'll probably only manage to waste 30 minutes gulping down water while the one ski wobbles all over the place, followed by an immediate start as soon as I strap on the second ski.  I don't know why I can’t get up on one, but I just really struggle with that.    I still can't believe he thinks that I am even remotely athletic.  I sure have him fooled...or maybe not.  I do snow ski, like to hike and camp, have a pretty decent Frisbee throw, and I live for time out on the lake.  Perhaps I'm not the uncoordinated, backward geek I've always thought I was.  Maybe that mental state was the only thing holding me back from fully embracing the jock within.  Maybe not.  One more thing, my mom told me yesterday that she and my dad might come down to Colorado to check out the fiddle contest I’m going to be in on August 7.  I really hope they come down because that would ROCK.  It’s always nice to feel support of the fam.

      This weekend was pretty interesting, so it is a good thing you signed on to read about it.  Friday night I went to bed early, but the mail man called as I was climbing into bed.  He was bored and wanted to hang out.  I told him I was going to bed early because I was getting up to go work on a farm at 5 am the next morning.  I was pretty excited that he called me to see what was going on. We decided that we would hang out Saturday night after he got back from a mission homecoming party of this girl he used to date.   Saturday morning I woke up before the sun, and made my way down to the church to meet up with the rest of the fools who thought hard manual labor on a Saturday morning sounded like a good idea.  I got an Einstein bagel with strawberry cream cheese (my fave) and was only there a couple of minutes late.  The original plan was to meet there at 5 and leave, but the night before someone called me and said we were meeting at 6.  I was really relieved.  I guess not everyone got the call informing of the changed meeting time, because some people were there at 5.  I would have been a little ticked off, if that were me.  Anyway, we all piled in the cars and took off.  I rode with Kirsten, Colin and Kevin.  Kevin is the guy who left a  urlLink CD on my car a month ago. Another interesting fact that I don't think has been mentioned here is that about 2 months ago Kevin backed into my friend (and Colin's girlfriend) Sarah's car and caused about $200 worth of damage.  He has yet to really apologize or offer to help pay her back for what was obviously his mistake.  Kevin makes CD of parodies of songs and his latest one is about to go into "mass production" or so he told us on the ride up.  Colin turned to him and said, "I have an idea.  Why don't you sell your CDs for $4 each, and then you can pay Sarah back the money you owe her."  The car went silent and I had to bite my lip to avoid laughing out loud.    We got up to the farm and it was pretty anticlimactic.  All we did was walk along one row of lima beans and pick the weeks in that row.  There were hardly any weeds at all and it took us about 20 minutes. I was a little let down because I came ready to work.    While we were working our rows, the kid next to me said he was really surprised to see me out working at the farm.  He said that working at the farm didn't really seem like something I would do.  This really surprised me because I really like doing stuff like that, but I must come across to him like some kind of really feminine girl who can't do an honest days work or something.  This is compounded by my friend Jamie saying last week that I didn't seem like the kind of girl who liked to camp.  What kind of image am I portraying to these people?!?!  Does everyone think this?!?!  After the farm I came back home and took a nap all afternoon.  At 5 I went over to the park across the street from my house and we played Ultimate Frisbee.  I did fairly well, and it was really fun.  None of my usual circle of friends was there and it felt really good to be with new people.  I'm really making an effort to branch out and not be so confined to my group of friends (AKA cliquey). It was REALLY hot and we were all SWEATY, so I invited everyone to come over and swim in my pool.  We played 500 for an hour or two until the sun went down.  It was really fun.  The mail man called while I was in the pool.  I jumped out, ran over to my phone and called him back.  Turns out he was going to the party later than he thought, and he wouldn't be back to hang out until later.  Fine with me because I was having a really good time playing in the pool.  One of the guys that was there was my roommate’s ex-boyfriend.  Everyone started talking about how she is now engaged and I could tell that he was kind of upset about the whole thing.  I felt really bad because I've been in that situation before.  Even if you don't want to be the one that is getting married to your ex, it still kind of hurts to see them in love with and engaged to someone else, especially if you aren't dating anyone.   After swimming at the pool we were all starving, so we went to chick-fil-a.  I was about done with hanging out with this large group of people and I was getting pretty excited to spend the evening with the mail man.  We were all standing around in the parking lot and everyone asked what we were doing next, and looked at me like I was some kind of events planner on a cruise ship.  I said I'd already planned most of the day’s events, so I didn't want to plan something.  Then, they all decided that the best idea would be to just come back to my house and watch a movie.    So the mail man came over and we only got to spend 15 minutes alone talking and stuff when they all came over.  It wouldn’t be so bad if it had been people I really liked to hang out with, but Kevin came over and he just drives me NUTS.  The mail man and I sat on the same couch and toward the end of the movie I was getting really tired, so he moved down to the floor so I could lay down on the couch.  It was a really nice thing for him to do. The movie ended, and everyone left.  I was really disappointed because I didn't get a chance to really talk to the mail man, so as I climbed into bed I called him and invited him to go to a BBQ with me Sunday afternoon.    After church on Sunday we had a dinner, so everyone stayed and hung out and talked.  The mail man sat directly across from me, which I thought was a good sign.  His ex-girlfriend who just got back from her mission was also there and sat at our table.  She was this perfect blonde who was really nice, so of course I was a little intimidated.  We talked for a while about BYU and Provo in general.  She didn't come off a bit territorial, like some girls can, so that was GREAT.  After we ate, he and I went out to the foyer.  I asked him what he was doing until the BBQ, and he said he had to take that other girl back home.  He also kind of apologized for her being there and said something about it being awkward or something.  I took that as a good thing.  If he thought we were just going to be "friend" and had no interest in me I don't think he would worry about things being awkward.    Anyway, I came home from church and read/slept for a while.  He called and woke me up at 4.  He came over and we went to play Frisbee in the park.  I wasn't throwing well at all, but he didn't make me feel bad.  Major points for him.  I am always so nervous about doing anything even slightly athletic around someone that I like because I'm really not good at anything like that.  It was REALLY hot, so we stopped early.  Then, we went over to Colin's BBQ.  I wanted to see if he would fit in with my best friends, and he totally did.  They're all going climbing tomorrow, which I think is cool. I could never date anybody, even for a month, that didn't like to hang out with my friends.  That would be a nightmare.   After the BBQ we went back to my house.  He stayed over until midnight and I taught him how to play Texas (a different version of the card game speed).  He was pretty good at it, and it was fun to play with someone who didn't mind loosing.  Then, we played real speed and he beat me.  I tried to be a good loser, but I'm just not.  Next time we play I am going to beat him so bad he won't know what hit him.  Anyway, while we played we talked and he asked questions about my family and where I'm from and my high school experience.  They seemed like more personal questions than you ask someone you're just being friends with.  I'm optimistic that he likes me back, but still not sure.  I'm still not really sure I want him to like me, but it is distracting and fun to think about, so I'm letting it take over.   Tonight we're going ice blocking for FHE, which should be fun.  I wish my friends would come, but they probably won't.  I remember last time I went ice blocking I had a crush on Ben Newson.  That was almost a year ago.  Marking time by my crushes is an interesting way to tell time.  I don't think I've ever thought about it like that before.   My co-worker and I are going out waterskiing tomorrow for a long lunch.  I am STOKED!  It will be my first time out this season and it will be a perfect day!  Hooray!

      Last night I went to see this movie with some friends.  There were some things presented in the movie that I didn't know before (like when Bush found out about the attacks, he sat there reading a book about a goat for 10 minutes instead of leaping to action as I previously assumed he did).  This is a movie that my dad probably shouldn't see as he will get so angry and not stop talking about it for a week.  To preserve my mom's sanity, they should avoid seeing it.   This may be a naive way of looking at the war in Iraq, and I don't want to make anyone mad enough to call and yell at me, but this is what I think is funny. I think it is interesting that people get so mad and say that the reason we went over there was for oil, like that isn't a valid reason.  To me, going over to save our oil supply is a dang good reason.  Our whole lifestyle is built on oil.  I think it's ironic when the same people who are protesting the war complain about high gas prices.  You can't complain about both.  Either you don’t like the war, and you are willing to give up using plastic or driving your car, or you support the war and are grateful for the conveniences we have in this country.  I fall into the latter category.

      I think my heart is too big.  I feel EVERYTHING, even other people's emotions. I just care so much about other people around me and I hate to see those I love stumbling.  I think I get this from my dad.  Why is it that we are supposed to work so hard to help other people avoid making mistakes, but in the end it is only they who can help themselves?  We are supposed to "bear each other's burdens" but when we stretch out a hand to help, the weight on our friend's back is just out of reach.

      My fiddling lesson after work went really well. I told my teacher that I am going to play in the contest in Loveland on August 7, so now we are focusing on getting my rounds put together.  I hope that a fiddling contest is different from a normal violin contest.  My past is filled with stressful failures when it comes to violin, and I really don't want to get into that again.    After my lesson I went over for institute, but it was cancelled because the teacher's wife went into labor.  I guess that's a good enough excuse, but I was really bummed for 2 reasons.  First, there was a chance that my favorite mail man would be there.  Second, I really wanted to go waterskiing this morning and I wanted to set it up with the guy who has the boat.  Alas, neither happened, so I was outta luck.    I went home and finished up the invitations for my party.  The preliminary guest list has almost 50 people on it.  I had no idea I knew that many people in Colorado.  I have to go back to the craft store tonight and get more paper for invites.  I'm just going to invite everyone.  That way if only half can come I'll still feel like a lot of people care.  I'm tricky huh.    So I was just sitting around watching a movie and I realized that I didn't want to do that all night again.  So, I decided to call up the mail man.  It took me about 15 minutes of weighing the possibilities before calling him up.  I've never called him before, and to be honest, he never really gave me his number.  Once I was looking at his phone comparing its ghetto-ness to my own phone and I called my number.  That way he'd have my number and I'd have his.  Tricky, huh.  Anyway, after realizing that the worst case scenario was that he would laugh in my ear and tell me that I am way too losery to hang out with I decided I could handle that, and I called him up.  I was a complete idiot on the phone, but somehow invited him to come over to my house and then we'd drive to Coldstone. I've decided that I will stop giving guys a hard time for not having the guts to ask out someone that you like.  That is REALLY hard!    We got ice cream and talked until 12:30 in the morning.  He is a really interesting kid, and way cute, but for some reason I just wasn't getting all that excited.  We sat on opposite couches and talked about his last girlfriend.  In January he broke up with a girl he thought he was going to marry.  The week after he did it, he started thinking that he'd made the wrong choice and the stress was so intense that he got hives.  He's really interesting, but the whole conversation kind of sent red flags up all over the place.  I told him about Derek and everything I learned from that relationship.  It was kind of funny because after I talked about Derek, I found out that mail man and Derek had worked together two years ago on the Unity IV rocket project at BYU.  Small world.   Since I made the first effort to show him that I want to be his friend by calling him up out of the blue, its his turn to return the favor.  If he is interested I think I made it really clear that I am too.  If he isn't, he's a retard.  I just got my mid-year review back and it looks GREAT!  I think I'll probably get a pretty big step increase, so maybe I'll actaully buy that washer and dryer I've been meaning to for 3 months.

      So I just found out that Maggie Jo has a boyfriend!  I am thrilled.  I just got pictures of them from my mom and he is dreamy!  I can't wait to post them here so you all can see what good taste she has.  I talked to her yesterday on the phone about him and she is just head over heals, GONE, for the kid!  That is great becuase he sounds like a quality guy.  Much better than the last one!

      Yesterday after work I drove all around looking for the best place to have my birthday party in a couple of weeks.  I've decided that I am going to have a roller skating party for my 23rd birthday.  I am way excited. I think I am going to try to find some New Kids on the Block, Debbie Gibson and MC Hammer for the occasion.  Maybe I'll pull out the black stretch pants and my scrunch socks. I remember having so much fun going to the rink and skating the couples skate with my crush in elementary school.  Maybe I can get a repeat...that’s probably way to optimistic.    As soon as I walked into the first place my mind was a wash of memories.  How come every roller skating rink smells the same?  If you don't believe me, check it out, they totally do.  Anyway, I really wanted to find a hardwood floor place, because that is what I skated on when I was little. Alas, I think that trend has fallen by the wayside.  They are all made out of a funky plastic now.  Oh well.    I talked for a while with one of the owners of one of the rinks.  He was a nice old man that reminded me of my grandpa.  I wondered if he had been running the rink since he was a young man and has witnessed the change of eras inside his dark, oval shaped, windowless world.  That would make an interesting movie.  Anyway, all the rinks I went to were pretty much the same so I am just going to pick the one that is closest to my house.    I was so proud because all I had were the addresses for the rinks. I just drove around and found them and didn't get lost or have to ask for directions once.  I think I'm finally feeling at home in Colorado.    After scoping out the rinks I decided to go to the craft store to get supplies for making the invitations.  I'm going to invite practically everyone I know to meet me at the rink at 7:30, but only a few to go out to dinner with me beforehand.  Is that rude?  I don't want to offend anyone by not inviting them to dinner, but I really HATE eating out in a large group.  Everyone is just loud and you can't have a good conversation and when the bill comes there is pure chaos.    I was over at Michaels and I thought I'd stop by Eric’s and use his computer.  I wanted to post my pictures from the trip to Durango, and the program that lets me do that is installed on his computer (since my company has completely banned downloading any programs). Anyway, when I got over there I tried to log onto his computer, but he changed his password.  RUDE.  I should totally be able to access his computer any time I feel like it (this phrase is said with total sarcasm).   So after all of these exploits I finally got home at around 6.  Amy and Erik were home and sitting downstairs, so I went up to my bedroom.  I ordered a pizza and ate almost the whole thing by myself while I started making the invitations.  I didn't go out, I didn't call anyone, I didn't answer my phone. I just glued, ate pizza, drank my Barq's root beer, watched Tommy Boy and fell asleep on the floor of my bedroom.  All in all a perfect night!

      This weekend had fireworks, both physical and emotional for me.  Friday we took off around 1 pm and headed down to Crested Butte.  Actually, the town closest to our final destination is called Pitkin.  The drive down was pretty interesting.  I sat in the middle of the back of Colin's green monster.  It was pretty cramped since I was sitting between Kristian and Colin's cousin Kierstin.  Anyway, we got to Pitkin alright, but the plan was to meet up with Jaime and Alan.  They were both late because Jaime thought we were meeting in Crested Butte, and traffic made a normally 6 hour drive from Los Alamos, NM a 9 hour drive for Alan.  Sarah and I waited down in town for them to show up while the others went up to set up the tents and stuff.  Sarah played the piano for me, and I played a guitar with only 5 strings.  Anyway, everyone showed up by 9.  We had hot dogs, smores and went to bed.    Saturday we woke up and Colin made breakfast burritos with spicy Italian sausage.  For some reason my body thought that it needed to wage a full out assault on the sausage.  I was doubled over in pain. While I was in agony, we were all sitting around the fire talking.  For some reason my mind and heart were jogged to think about my Aunt Sandy who died of colon cancer 2 months ago.  Remembering her was more than I could bear in front of everyone, so I took a little walk in the woods to clear my head.  I really miss her and because I didn't get to go to the funeral I still haven't really dealt with her passing.  I miss her so much it is unreal.  Anyway, so after a while of being alone and thinking things through I came back to camp.  Everyone was getting ready for a hike, so I strapped on the old hiking boots and headed off with the group.  We drove up to the trail head and parked.  I walked for about 5 minutes and started feeling a lovely churning in my stomach.  I thought if I just got moving it would all mix up and stop hurting.  Just as we got to the steep part of the ascent to the top it started feeling like someone was ripping me in half.  I had to curl up and just lay in the middle of the path.  Well, it was about this time that I decided the top of the mountain was not for me, and Sarah and I turned around and walked back down.  We made it to the cars alright, and I sat down and let my stomach just knead itself.  Well, it had been a long time, so we decided that we wouldn't wait for the others to get back to the cars, we'd just walk back down to the campsite.  I should have known better than to take off with Sarah.  Almost every trip I've been on with that girl she takes off and gets lost.  Anyway, we took a wrong turn somewhere and our trial dropped off the wrong side of the mountain.  We walked and walked and walked until Sarah noticed that the pine trees of our campsite had turned into Aspen groves, indicating we were WAY below the elevation of our campsite.  There was nothing for it, but to just keep walking.  Eventually, we came to the orange circle reflectors and knew we were almost back, but since we had dropped so far, I knew the hike back would include a pretty serious climb.  I was tired and hungry and not really sure of the right road, so we asked these mountain hicks where we needed to go.  They offered us a ride and some cherry cake, and we accepted.  We got back to the campsite and Colin and his uncle had gone out and searched for us.  In my brain, I like to think that Colin was worried about Sarah because he is crazy about her.  It made me miss having a boyfriend who would search for me if I got lost.  Or take of his snowboard and hike back up a black run to find me.  When we got back I took a nap, but was awakened to a strange repetitive thumping.  I shook off my grogginess and found out that Colin and Alan had decided to chop down a tree.  Guys are so weird.  I would never look at a big tall tree in a forest and use a dull axe to chop it down.  Anyway, it took a really long time, and ended up falling the wrong direction, so they couldn't even use it for firewood.  For dinner we had chili up at some friend's cabin.  Everyone was raving about how it was the best chili ever and I politely remained silent, because I didn't think it was as good as my mom's.  After dinner we went down to Pitkin for the town ho-down.  I was disappointed because I thought it would be bluegrass and square dancing, but it was just a DJ playing bad music like a church dance.  I did get to dance with Alan and Eric both, which was nice.  Afterward, more smores.  Sunday morning we got up, made banana pancakes and took off for Crested Butte.  This town is AMAZING.  It was small and right in the mountains and just great.  I could live there if there was a job for me.  Anyway, we watched a parade and I caught a red plastic duck thrown by the shriners.  At the end of the parade, the whole town went crazy and had a big water fight.  Alan drenched me, which was exciting.  I was so cold.  After the parade we went on a hike.  We were all wearing flip flops, so it wasn't all that intense.  At one point, Jaime dropped her backpack and it almost fell into the creek.  About half way through the hike we found a bench and sat down and hung out. I made a daisy chain bracelet, and the boys dropped big rocks into the creek to make splashes.  Eric decided to put a bunch of rocks in the bike trail so that the bikers would have a challenge.  Like the brat that i am, I moved them all back out of the way.  Everyone teased me about be the Mom and ruining the fun, but I could just see someone like me who doesn’t know how to mountain bike at all get to those rocks and freak out.  Anyway, I hiked on a little farther by myself to clear my head.  The whole day I had been overly sarcastic and mean to almost every body.  I had complained about the hike and just been really annoying.  I realized that I hated that about myself and felt really embarrassed by my actions.  I resolved to change and be better. Half of us hiked back to town, and the other half hiked back to the cars.  I was a towner.  When we got back something just wasn't right with Eric, so I tried to talk to him and see what was wrong. I ended up acting really immature and I was embarrassed again.  We all split up for dinner.  I went with Sarah and Colin.  As I sat eating my chicken burrito, I realized that I had acted poorly and all I wanted to do was apologize to Eric.  As soon as I saw him again I went up to him and said I was sorry.  He was so confused and asked what he had done wrong.  I told him it was nothing, and I felt like I was acting like a baby.  Things got all worked out, so that was GREAT.  We all sat in a field and watched the fireworks.  We were right under them, and once I thought the embers were going to drop right on us.  It was cool.  I was sandwiched between two couples and didn't have anyone to cuddle with, but besides that it was great.  Monday we woke up, broke camp, and drove home.  When I got home I took the longest, hottest shower of my life.  In three days my hair had become so greasy it looked like I was developing dreads.  Anyway, after the shower I settled down and was watching Finding Nemo, when my roommate Amy and her man came in.  She threw something at me, and when I found it I was shocked.  It was a diamond ring.  Turns out he proposed on Friday and she said yes, so I am yet again living with an engaged chick.  I'm so happy for her because they are a great match, but they've only been dating since April.  They've also decided to get married Jan 6, which means no winter break trip for me.  I guess it’s worth the sacrifice (this phrase is said reeking with sarcasm). I mentioned something about throwing her a bridal shower and then I realized that might have been presumptive.  I mean, I'm pretty sure that is a maid of honor thing to do, and I'm sure she'll ask one of her sisters, or his sisters to do that.  But, now that I've said it I think I'm locked into throwing it, which I'd love to do. I hope I didn't overstep my bounds.  Oh well if I did.    So seeing her engaged and reading bridal magazines kind of shook me up.  Now that my 23rd birthday is rapidly approaching should I be thinking about getting married?  Am I a menace to the ward if I am not dating someone or constantly searching for someone else?  Will I end up the cool aunt with a bunch of cats that everyone brings their kids over to see?

      So for the first time I went out with someone to lunch that I didn't know at all.  Good thing I am such a stellar conversationalist.  The only thing that was too bad was that he really didn't ask anything about me.  I felt like I was the one asking all the questions.  Anyway, we talked about skiing (my new passion) and rock climbing and mountain biking and riding motorcycles.  I don't really do any of the last three, so I didn't really have much to say.  We talked about our families and where we grew up and stuff.  We started talking about music (my territory), but he never really asked what I liked.  Which I thought was a little self centered on his part.  He paid for my lunch (which made the whole thing feel really date-ish and made me a little uncomfortable to tell you the truth).  When we got back to work he asked if we could do it again sometime or maybe something else and I said sure because he was a nice enough person and you can never have too many friends.  Anyway, about an hour after I'd been back at my desk he emailed me and apologized for not asking more about the stuff I was interested in. I was impressed by that.  Then, he asked if I liked to dance.  This was a MAJOR selling point because I LOVE to dance and I haven't gone, or had someone to go with since Mexico in January.  If he wants to take me out dancing, I'm up for it any time.

      So in a preemptive strike I have decided that I, in fact, do not have a crush on the boy that I previously thought I did.  After institute last night I tried to talk to him and get the same vibe I did on Monday night, but it just wasn't there, so now I'm not interested.  Actually, to be truthful, I don't think he is into me, so I am deciding that I am not into him before he has the chance to make it perfectly clear that he isn't interested.  This way I am saved the feelings of rejection that I will avoid at all costs right now.  One of my closest friend's grandpa died earlier this week, and she flew out this morning for the funeral.  Last night Sarah and I were going to get her flowers and a card for her.  We were walking into the store when, wouldn't you know it, she drove up to us.  It was so random that we just happen to be going to the store at the same time.  Anyway, we didn't know what to say when she asked us what we were getting, so I lied and said I needed a Pepsi (plausible since I am an addict). Anyway, we got her the flowers and a card, and showed up on her front step about 30 minutes after we saw her.  It was really bizarre.  We hung out at her house really late and when I realized what time it was, and how early she had to get up for her flight, and that she hadn't packed yet I decided to high tail it outta there.    Today I am going to lunch with the stranger who asked me out on Monday.  I saw him earlier today in the hallway, and I tried to be nice, but he was kind of weird.  I hope this isn't too uncomfortable, but I can take anything for an hour, right?   So today is one of those days that I just don't want to do anything or see anybody. I just want to go home and crawl back into my bed, watch a movie or read a book and eat really buttery popcorn.  Today after work I'm planning on packing for the weekend trip, doing laundry, and cleaning my bathroom.  I am SO exciting. I bet you are really glad that you read this entry today.

      So I'm pretty sure the universe is completely balanced.  This morning I got into work and hated my job. I was hating the guy I work for and the stuff I'm doing and just everything about work.  Then, my functional manager called me.  Turns out I got a 5% raise that will be retroactively applied back to the beginning of July.  All of the sudden things don't look so bad.  Work is worth coming to every day.  Hooray.  I spent the rest of the morning wandering around campus talking to friends and enjoying the perfect 75 degree, blue skies day outside.  Then I went and got my car's registration renewed.  It was only $300, when I was expecting it to be $400.  Nice.

      So yesterday wasn't very eventful. I went to the grocery store after work and I only got 4 items: eggs, brownie mix, Doritos Guacamole chips, and a pepsi. Healthy dinner, eh? I made the brownies and took some over for Eric, since they are his favorites. We watched a new dating reality show called outback jack. Those things are always so dumb. I made comments through the whole show, which I'm sure was totally annoying for Eric. How can people think they are in love with someone they've only known a few weeks? Especially if those few weeks don't consist of any reality and it is completely staged? I just don't get it. You have to be as dumb as rocks to believe you are able to really get to know someone while shooting a TV show.  I left Eric's at around 8 because the mailman and I had planned to "hang out." Just as I got home a huge rain storm broke. It was torrential, and the hail was gnarly. Once again I was thankful for covered parking. I watched the storm from my big bedroom window. It was awesome.  The mailman didn't call me until 8:45, and didn't come over until 9:30. Lame.  We met up with Sarah and Colin at Bova's Frozen Custard in Boulder. The flavor of the day was Pralines and Cream, which is my absolute fave! We walked around the hill for a while. It was strange. Sarah and I walked in front talking and the mailman and Colin walked behind us talking.  After custard, we drove back to my house and sat around talking until 2:30 in the morning. It was kind of lame because he kept telling me the same stories that he's already told me. Another exciting part of the convo was when we talked about his ex-girlfriends. Actually, this is his favorite topic to talk about. Annoying.  I told him I was disappointed because he didn't meet my parents this weekend and he said he was sorry he didn't get to meet them. Whatever, obviously not sorry enough to have tried to meet them.  When he left I said goodbye because since I'm leaving Friday for my family vacation and he's leave Sunday for a week at Lake Powell, I probably won't get to see him again for a while. After Lake Powell he is either going straight back to BYU, or he'll come back to Colorado to go on a backpacking trip with his family. Either way, I probably won't get to spend the evening alone with him again. As we were saying goodbye he said that he had something for me still, so it wasn't the last, real goodbye. I said "cool" but in my mind I thought, "yeah, right."  Anwyay, tonight is girls night and we're all going to see princess diary 2. Looks like the movie will be retarded, but it will be fun to be out with all the girls. Amy (my roommate) might even come because Erik (her fiance) started football camp this week so now she has ample spare time. That is freakin AWESOME! I get my best friend back! Hooray!

      So I've decided that I am going to be stuck doing FHE until I have learned the importance of it and love serving in my calling. That is why I've been doing the same thing for over a year. I wish there was a way I could improve my attitude, but I just really don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. It wouldn't be so bad if I was in charge because then I would just have fun outdoors things every week and good food. Since I'm not in charge, just a lowly cog in the machine, I have to be supportive of activities that I think are lame. For example, last night we played mad libs. It was a beautiful day outside and we sat in the institute building trying to come up with funny stories that were just lame. My real concern is that we NEVER do any kind of service. Its really a shame and a waste of people who are probably willing to help whenever they can.  The mailman was there, but he came late so I couldn't talk to him before the activity. I couldn't talk to him during the activity because I was on the other team, then I had to cut and serve the brownies I made (and will not be reimbursed for). After that I was going to go talk to him, but he was on his phone, so I decided to call Kathy (my bff) back. We talked a while and when I got off, the mailman was on his way out the door to go play hockey. Whatever.  On my way home I thought that maybe it was more my fault that we weren't talking. I mean, its not like I make it really easy for him or anything. I called up and asked when I could schedule some time into his busy social calendar. He said we could hang out Tuesday (today). He was really excited sounding, so turns out he isn't trying to avoid me. Good news. So now we are hanging out tonight and I feel like I have to come up with something to do. Ugh. All I really want to do it go to Bova's frozen yogurt for white chocolate tonight. Any other ideas?  Today I'm going to lunch with my friend Patrick from work. He is really cool and is reading Atlas Shrugged right now. That book is so good and if someone likes it I immediately feel like I have a connection with them. That and the Harry Potter books. I'm such a nerd.  Derek called me yesterday, but I was already in bed. It was quite a surprise to hear from him, since he isn't the best in the world at keeping in touch. Every time I hear his voice it makes me smile and remember how happy I was when I was his close friend/girlfriend. What a kid!

      Friday after work I drove out to pick my parents up from the airport. I left with plenty of time to get there, but didn't count on the traffic, so I was still on the road when my mom called from the terminal. Boo, I wanted to be there waiting when they walked into the terminal. Oh well, I found a parking lot (barely) and kind of ran into the building. Took the escalator up to the baggage claims and saw my parents. They are the coolest ever. My mom and I talked while my dad got the bags. Within 15 minutes of seeing me, they both made comments about what I was wearing. I didn't know if I should take it as a compliment, or what, so I just ignored it. We drove to Boulder, got my dad a knee brace, and went to dinner on Pearl St. My parents thought the waitress was on drugs, and she very well might have been. She kept saying things about how the greens were "organic" and the meat was free range. This just cracked my dad up.  Saturday morning we woke up and headed out to my contest. We got there late because I am a retard and didn't mapquest the right place. I was nervous that they weren't going to let me play, but it turned out that my division was last in the day, so I wouldn't be playing until like 4 in the afternoon. We sat around and listened to the little kids who were worlds better than I am, and during the fiddling break there were some nationally ranked cloggers come to exhibition, which was cool. It made me want to break out the old clogs and join a studio...or at least clog in my garage. I played alright, and since I was the only person who signed up to be in my division, I won. $75! I was stoked. I was even more stoked that Eric and Colin came to see me play. I don't know why, but I am always floored when my friends go out of their way to support me. Its not like it isn't anything I wouldn't do for them, but it just seems to mean more. Especially from Eric.  After the contest, my parents took me, Eric and Colin out to dinner. We ate at Rhumba on Pearl St. The food was great, but our waiter was a weirdo. When he was telling us the specials he too kept emphasizing the organic nature of everything. My dad started laughing, and I had a hard time. Especially when he said something was "dusted with carrot powder." Boulder is a strange place for sure.  Church on Sunday was nice. Afterward, all of my friends sat around for a while and talked with my parents, which was so cool. My mom was being really funny.  One thing to note, the mail man didn't say hi or talk to me all day. Retarded. If the situation was reversed I would for sure go up to him and let myself be introduced to his parents. I thought the deal was that we were going to be friends first and foremost. He didn't even act like I was there or that he knew me. Lame.  After I took them back to the airport, I went for family dinner. We had fajitas, and played frisbee afterward. While we were eating dinner this random dog of the apartment above Colin's decided it would be cool to just wander between our legs and under the table because we were sitting out on the patio. Why do dog owners think that everyone loves their animal as much as they do? I guarantee you, we DON'T.  Today I'm meeting Amy and Sarah at Urban Outfitter as high noon because they are having a sale and that $75 prize money is burning a hole in my pocket.

      So since I moved up into this office I've been told to 1)fix the copier 2) run down to another department to pick up some copies 3) run off some handouts for someone else's meeting which made me late to my own meeting and caused my lead to make a comment in front of my whole team about being on time to meetings 4) make coffee.  I'm pretty sure none of these tasks fall into the job requirement of associate engineer. UGH!

      So I've lived away from home now for 5 years, and this is the first year that I have really felt all alone and grown up.  All through college I lived within a 10 minute drive of my grandma and aunt.  They would take care of me, feed me when I was starving, give me a place of refuge when I couldn't handle the stresses of single life, you know...family support.   Now that I am in Colorado and completely without family I realize how important they are to me. I also realize how lucky I was to have them during college.  Also, I realize how important it is for me to have a surrogate family here.  It is really comforting to know that I have people in my life who just sit there and let me cry on their shoulders if I really need to.  No judgement, no attempted problem solving, just there to help and love me.  Those people have no idea how much they mean to me.  I don't know what I'd do without them...probably move away from here.   So yesterday I was accused of not working hard at my job (by the mailman) and it REALLY hurt my feelings.  I'm not a slacker, and I hate that my job isn't more challenging for me.  For someone to just make fun of the effort that I do put in really hurts.  I'm frustrated by the fact that work isn't really hard and totally consuming, and to have someone say that's MY fault is hard to hear.  Although, in reality it may be my fault.  Maybe I should be doing more or working harder or finding interesting things to research or learn instead of just completing my assigned role to the best of my ability.  Stuff to think about.

      I had a little down time at work today, so I thought I'd start the search of schools and programs to see what my options are.  I went to Stanford first (of course) and there are two professors that have really interesting areas of research.  Both are in design.   When I graduated from BYU I thought that the thermal and fluid sciences were the most interesting to me.  After a few years of being away from school I realize I just liked them because everyone thought they were hard and I would feel like the smartest person if that were my real interest.  Now, I just really don't think that is the stuff I like.  I really like the idea of learning better ways to design things and make them more useful for consumers.  This falls perfectly into the description of one of the profs at Stanford (my dream school).  I think tomorrow I'll email him and see what specifically he does for his research.  Any suggestions on how to go about proving to him that I am the BEST qualified grad student and he would be a fool not to fully fund my education?!?!

      Growing up I never really did very many athletic/outdoorsy things. I grew up in Seattle where it rains 9 months of the year, making any kind of hiking or camping pretty hard. Plus, my mom grew up in Utah, so she had attitude about skiing on slushy snow. As a result I ended up doing mostly indoor things. I play the violin, love going to the movies, know my way around the Seattle science center like a pro, and have been to the best aquariums in the world.  When I moved out to Colorado I was all of the sudden thrust into a totally foreign environment. People here don't know how to do anything but play outside. It is just a given that everyone is into mountain biking, rock climbing and snow skiing. Well, I've decided that instead of letting the fact that I am really bad at this stuff because I just haven't been exposed stop me from trying it, I'd give it a whirl. I LOVE this stuff. Sometimes I wake up dreaming of a bluebird ski day in the middle of the summer.  Saturday morning I went out to the lake to try windsurfing for the first time. This is a GREAT sport! The wind was really light in the morning so I was able to really get the feel of pulling the sail up out of the water and sheeting into the wind. A little bit later the wind picked up and I was truckin across the water. It was WAY cool.  This morning I went waterskiing before coming into work. I can get up on one ski pretty regularly, but sometimes I cut too hard coming back into the wake and I end up eating it. My body is going to be REALLY sore tomorrow. Good thing the mail man hinted that he might give me a back massage tonight. (cross your fingers)  Tonight at FHE we are playing ultimate frisbee. I'm actually becoming one of the better players. I never knew it, but half of being good at sports is just thinking that you are actually good at it. This is something that I learned up on the slopes at Vail. If you grit your teeth and believe that you can get down a hill, you usually can.  Everyone probably is like, "duh" to this realization, but I have never really been sporty at all, so it is a new thing for me.  At church on sunday the mail man completely ignored me and talked with his exgirlfriend the WHOLE three hours. I was really annoyed, but then I realized that he's not my boyfriend, and I've only known him for two months. He dated his exgirlfriend for over a year, so obvioulsy their friendship means more to him than ours does. It just hurts a little to realize that, you know?  Last night we were over having family dinner at Amy's house (not my roommate Amy, another one). It was the best group of people. Eric, Brett, Amy, Kristian, and Jocelyn. That Jocelyn is just so cool. I really feel lucky to know her. She is so laid back and chill all the time, I really need to work on being more like that. By the end of the night Amy had pulled out a big piece of cardboard and she and Eric were attempting to breakdance on it. Too bad neither of them really know what they were doing, but they looked good doing it. Again, there was another awkward moment with Eric. I don't want to date him at all, but sometimes I find myself thinking that making out with him really wouldn't be all that bad.  During church yesterday I said something really mean to a good friend and instantly knew I shouldn't have said it. For some reason my big annoying pride got pricked and I didn't have the guts to admit I had been in the wrong and say I was sorry. I tried to talk to him after church, but he left right away. Then, I saw him again later that night and by then I just felt dumb about the whole thing. I should have just said I was sorry right away. Why can't I accept reproof?  As a sidenote:  Mags, you will notice that there is no description of what I ate all weekend.  Pretty impressive huh?!?!
