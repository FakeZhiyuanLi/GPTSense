      If I have to be left in this mother fucker  one more time by myself  because one of my co-workers wants a weekend night off, and offers up some bullshit excuse, I am seriously walking out the door.   I'm here on time every night and hardly ever call out and I just think it's ridiculous.

      Well, well, what do we have  urlLink  here .  Mary-Kate Olsen is being treated for an eating disorder.  As if it wasn't obvious.  The girl is 2 pounds and you can see her bones from crying out loud.    Blech..

      My hair is actually going gray.   Fast .  Both my great-grandmothers on both sides of the family were completely gray by the time they were 25.  Great.  My mother, on the other hand, didn't get a single gray hair until her early forties.  Ain't that some shit.  I started noticing a gray hair here or there when I was 18.  Over the years it has progressively gotten worse.  I'm dreading having to buy hair color every month to cover it.  It's definitely something genetic because my brother is rapidly going gray and now my sister is starting to find gray hairs as well and she just turned 18.  Grrr..

      There are just some features I can't get installed where I have my journal hosted now.  So hopefully this will be my final move.

      The gall of Brad never ceases to amaze me.  He didn't work one day last week and was off on the holiday but didn't get paid for it so his check was short.  He gave me what he owed me for bills but his cell phone got turned off.  I told him he could take mine  to work with him , since I turned mine off during the day anyway.  He's been off for the past couple of days and is never home when I ask him to be.  All I ask is that he be home by 9pm since I have to go over to my parent's house to take a shower since our gas is turned off.  He can't even do that, plus he takes my phone with him (which I never told him he could do) so that I can't even track him down.  Yesterday he took 20 dollars out of my money -- without asking, of course -- and claims he used it to buy food and beer for himself, even though there's stuff to eat in the kitchen.  He's been over at my brother's all day so needless to say, I don't believe that's how he spent the money.  He then has the nerve to ask me to buy him cigarettes in the morning.  I originally told him no because he has 20 dollars of my money all day long yet "forgot" to buy himself a pack of cigarettes.  He couldn't do that while he was buying his beer?? Bullshit.  I asked him for receipts from his purchases today and of course, he couldn't provide them.  So now in addition to what he owes me for bills next week, he's got to pony up and extra 23 dollars as well.  I'm starting to get pissed because he's using and taking advantage of me now.  I just think it's really sad when you're reduced to having to hide your phone and money from someone you'd think you could trust.
