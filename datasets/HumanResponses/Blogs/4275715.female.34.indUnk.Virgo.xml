						   I woke up this morning feeling really depressed...dunno why. last nite b4 going to bed, I prayed to God for me and him...hoping that everything wud be fine with us one day. I prayed for God to give me a sign. Then I dreamt that he was with me and we were about to catch a plane somewhere.  Me n my boyfriend, we've been togather for 3 years. I live here in Singapore and he lives in New York. We keep our relationship going by telephone and by me or him making the effort to fly up to see each other but that happens 2 or 3 times a year depending on whether he can make it here. All the time when we're apart, I feel so 'apart' from him. People ask, why don't u both get married. Well, I guess God is not allowing that to happen yet.  5 months ago I fell into a very deep depression. I was on anti-depressant and I cannot stop crying for days. I became better after afew weeks and I told myself that I never want to go thru this again but now I can feel it creeping back to me and I dunno how to prevent this. My boss came to me at work this morning and ask me why am I so quiet?! He mentioned that he's afraid to see me be so quiet. I didn't respond coz I know that if I did I would break down.  I find my life so unmeaninful. I'm doing things that people close to me wants me to do. If given the choice, I wud just resign from this hell hole of my company and take a break for 3 or 6mths go for a holiday....be with him (my boyfriend) for awhile and come back and do things I want to do.....why is it so difficult for me to make such a decision?

						    Hi, my name is Hani. I'm from Singapore. I'm 34years old and still single....life for me lately have been like a topsy turvy and I'm here to let out my feelings, get to know people and to welcome all of you out there to give me your views, your support and your opinions....   Firstly, I have to say the most depressing part of life right now is my job. I hate getting up in the morning going to a job that I don't enjoy, that I think is not fulfilling and meaningless. This job is full of politics and back stabbers. How can I stay long in such an environment? I know that most of you out there will tell me to leave but the money is luring me to stay alittle longer than I should. I'm now looking to do something that I want but I'm lost and confused, dunno where to begin. Than comes my long distance relationship. I've been with a man who prctically lives 20,000miles away from me and if I'm not up there to see him, the only form of contact is the phone and it's not helping me.....
