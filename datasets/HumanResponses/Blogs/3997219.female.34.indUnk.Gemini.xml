      I am so excited-- finally a place to house all the cool new bands I keep tripping over!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't do P2P or Kazaa or any of that.&nbsp; I never tried Napster until it was legal&nbsp;.&nbsp; I'm still completely confused by the whole copyright infringement issue.&nbsp; I would like to follow the rules but the problem is the ones I do understand seem ridiculous and inappropriate.   For example, we used to make mix tapes when I was in high school.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;say you're a teenage girl and you are so in loooooovvvve with a boy.&nbsp; You make him a mix tape of&nbsp; your songs,&nbsp; or put the lyrics in a letter you write to him.&nbsp; Ahh, how sweet.&nbsp; (To girls. All the guys I knew truly hated this ritual.)&nbsp;   Welcome to the 21st century where we have chilling acts of terrorism, the internet and illegal P2P.&nbsp;&nbsp; So now you're a teenage girl and instead of listened to KROQ it's Napster or Rhapsody.&nbsp; You burn a mix CD of your songs and life is grand because, unlike in your mom's time,&nbsp; you don't have to try to stop the tape before the DJ&nbsp; talks or get truly angry because he talked over the words at the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you print a cute little label out, maybe with a picture of you kissing (this would have meant boarding school for me- can't kiss if you can't date.&nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; That's what they made lunch time for isn't it?&nbsp; )&nbsp; And you give the CD to the great love of your life.&nbsp;   The worst case scenario I saw in&nbsp;the late 80's&nbsp; involved the parent of the boy calling your parents because the songs were suggestive :  &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink Pleasure Victim by Berlin    Now, I would have already been up the creek on this one because I wasn't supposed to date&nbsp;until I was 17 (I was a&nbsp;miserable teenage honor student whose&nbsp;mother was&nbsp;beyond paranoid.&nbsp;It's truly laughable how innocent I was.&nbsp; Very&nbsp;clever in finding ways around&nbsp;her, but not to go out and smoke crack and get pregnant.&nbsp; I snuck over to my friend's house down the street and watched Riptide with her.&nbsp; And both of her parents.&nbsp;What a rebel.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now, it could be a federal warrant instead with a $1000 fine.&nbsp; I can see the point.&nbsp; I get it&nbsp;.&nbsp; If she were selling it, or in some way profiting from it financially, fine, but that was not what was happening.&nbsp; And yet I am still against Kazaa and P2P in general.&nbsp;  I am off my subject though now, far far far off, which was to offer a new find for your listening pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Think along the lines of Dishwalla, Three Doors Down, Goo Goo Dolls--- melodic alternative.&nbsp;   The band is called Vonray  Vonray   They released an album and it actually did ok.  They used one of the songs on Smallville, but the singer has decided he doesn't like the business side so they quit last month.  I am so so sad!  But check it out- and here you can watch the video as well:    Vonray Videos On Yahoo Launch

      The Goo Goo Dolls are a fantastic band to see live and we are in the first 11 rows so this should be cool--- I had hoped for closer but, this is their only date since Jan on the West Coast with none pending so I'm happy enough about it to drive the 5 hours it will take to get there.    We saw the Goo Goo Dolls last year when they opened for Bon Jovi at the Staples Center (3rd row seats mind you) and at Arrowhead Pond as well.  I have to interrupt myself to comment that seats this close, 3rd row just off center, are unbelievable.  It gives you a whole different perspective!!  My husband commented that it reminded him of being at a high school dance.  I didn't comment but these guys on stage were  a lot hotter than I remember the guys at my school being.   We had to buy our 3rd row tickets on eBay-and they weren't cheap.  Were they worth it? Oh God -   YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YYYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSS!!!!       (note: euphoric shouts of glee not orgasmic ones.  Almost but.........  No.  1st row and maybe next time they might be orgasmic- I'll get back to you on that one.)       You have to understand that I am a child of the 80's and I sort of liked Poison maybe just a little, and was 16 year old girl with raging hormones an not many hot guys in my corner of the world back  in 1986 when my infatuation with Jon Bon Jovi began.  My taste in music didn't quite fit with my peers.  The boys who liked "heavy metal" were the ones I always seemed to get hung up on   (I had a bad boy complex big time-- good girl never been in trouble always wants  the bad boys- note-I was an honor student surrounded by extremely smart Japanese kids, the initial computer geeks , science geeks. Latin Club, Chess Club and quite a few people who wore glasses now that I think back.)  .  The "metallers" favored KNAC, if they had long hair it didn't appear they washed it much and grunge wasn't going to be my thing anyway,  they drew satanic symbols on their Pee Chee's, talked a lot bigger than anything they actually did and referred to Bon Jovi as a chick band,  posers -nothing all that flattering.  They leaned towards Motley Crue, Iron Maiden, Ozzie.  I just couldn't quite go that far. Plus, I was lusting for Jon Bon Jovi and there are no lust-worthy candidates amongst those other bands (just an opinion)--- I loved Def Leppard but it lacked the "hottie" factor for me and just never hit the same level of devotion.   Jon Bon Jovi fought the Philadelphia Soul and I have caught a couple Arena Football games- despite the fact that I had no idea what was going on.  And I don't understand regular football.    The majority of my other classmates favored KROQ for New Order, Frankie Goes to Hollywood,  Depeche Mode, the Smiths and I was not of he same mindset.  Something about Depeche Mode makes all their songs sound way too similar to me and they can only be taken in very small 1-2 song doses before I want to rip my hair out.  The KROQ listeners did not understand how Bon Jovi could even be considered Music- the Smiths songs were deep, meaningful poetry that spoke to them blah blah blah. My hormones were raging out of control.  Watching Jon Bon Jovi in tight leather pants singing about his raging hormones spoke to me and what it said felt pretty freaking meaningful if you ask me.  Unbelievably meaningful--- I just hadn't really figured out what it actually meant as yet.    Then there were the kids who liked KIIS FM and leaned towards Madonna, Michael Jackson  (I did know someone who could moonwalk pretty good--  cute Japanese cheerleader believe it or not!!), Janet Jackson..........   and these KIIS FM listeners  kept saying you couldn't dance to Bon Jovi.  Not like they were dancing but I still think they looked hilarious.  And,  I still think they're wrong- you can dance to Bon Jovi.  Most of the girls on the floor at the Staples Center seemed to be able to do it.   So, I carried my Bon Jovi obsession out into the big bad world.  I do have a few friends now who like them, and now the looks I get aren't why do you like them but sadly seem to have become a puzzled look somewhere along the lines of - but you have 2 kids (6 and 3)   don't you?  (implies:  aren't you too old to be going to concerts period especially bands I've heard of --- aren't you supposed to like Barry Manilow or Neil Diamond,  how about Celine Dion?)  Sigh.  Jon Bon Jovi just turned 40- if he can be em>on   the stage  with way more energy than most people I know half his age, just lead me to the show and leave me alone while I relive my youth in my Seven Jeans dancing to Bon Jovi about 25 feet away from the object of my 16 year old hormonal driven fantasies and a few 34 year old mother of 2 considerably more detailed and erotic ones.    Anyway,  given my 18 year infatuation-  (pause while I sob,  just realizing my infatuation itself is a legal adult now in it's own right. How the hell did that happen? )    The concert did make me feel less of a "Mom" and more of a "me".  That has to be a positive thing.  And  I am thrilled to say that my 5 year old really really likes Bon Jovi.  Britney Spears is to him what Shaun Cassidy actually was to me about that age.  Sigh.  Now I feel old again.    It really was such a different world 18 years ago- I had to satisfy myself with Tiger Beat and Circus articles about Bon Jovi.  If we could have done then what we shouldn't do now even though we can,  I  could have had fake porn pictures downloaded from the web and illegally downloaded MP3's to hide with what must then have been illegal mix cassette tapes from songs I taped off the radio.  We'll skip that recording music issue for now.    Where were we? Right-  Johnny Rzeznik ,  lead singer of the Goo Goo Dolls.  Interesting man.   Fans have mentioned in articles that after meeting him they ended up discussing art, philosophy and literature and coming away impressed with how knowledgeable and intelligent he is.   (I've also seen some 5 star reviews about a totally different oral skill that some fans have experienced and raved and praised and raved some more....Any guesses what that skill might be??  Isn't the internet an incredibly valuable research tool? I don't know that i need to know that but I do find it thought provoking)  Take all that and add in the musical ability and he could very well be using a greater portion of his brain than I do. (Not to mention that other little skill he has that isn't nearly as effectively practiced by men as it should be.)  Sounds like a stimulating guy if you ask me.  I know- bad joke.  I'm sure you get the point.  I don't know but  you walk a mile in my shoes and then try to be intellectual after a couple of Yu-gi-oh episodes (I don't see the magic at all), some Playstation that doesn't even slightly resemble my Atari games ,which I also sucked at, all spent with a 6 year old and a 3 year old who thinks he is Annakin Spiderman,  (yes that would be Annakin Skywalker and Spiderman combined) This name was said firmly while wearing his Annakin costume over his Spiderman one with his froggie rainboots and Star  Wars battery operated light saber extended and in hand while watching Star Wars Episode 2 - Attack of the Clones. Picture him acting out the battle scene with Yoda  towards the end. Battle scene ends and light saber goes down and he tries to climb the wall. Spiderman has taken over.  We have to call him that to.  Ok, we don't have to unless you want him to respond.   Welcome to my world.  There is much to be philosophical about but very little that resembles normal.    So, anyway, Goo Goo Dolls.  Johnny Rzeznik has actually accomplished quite a bit more than you would have expected given how difficult it must have been.  His parents died a little more than a month apart when he was 15 or 16 years old.  Mine died within 2 months of each other when I was 28 and it was something that is very difficult to capture in words.  I can't imagine that happening when you're a kid.  He has 2 or 3 older sisters who ended up raising him and he did go through a rough period where it just seems like it would have been so easy to end up in jail or a heroine addicot or dead.  He credits the good stable friends he had who were there for him and helped him refocus and after a lot of years of hard work,  he's accomplished incredible things.  He stayed in and finished high school and even started college -  I know a lot of kids with 2 living parents and perfectly stable lives who weren't nearly as grounded as he sounds.  I know after my parents died I had a hard time concentrating for months and at that age..........  I really do find it amazing that he had that to deal with at such a young age.  It had to be beyond terrifying.  He deserves a lot of respect when you really tink about it.    I really do like their music a lot and he has the "hottie" factor necessary to hook me for many reasons.  So, the kids are going to see Grandma while Mommy and Daddy traipse up to the concert.  My boys like the song Johnny Rzeznik did for Treasure Planet--Jim's Theme- I'm still Here.  Very cool song too.      So Goo Goo Dolls Tonight and in about 3 weeks we have Pit tickets for Nickelback with Puddle of Mudd at the Universal Amphitheater--- that will be cool- I break out the leather pants for that one.  Yes I am going to be the mother who is an embarrassment to their teenagers.  Oh well, bummer for them.  I guess if they want  to rebel they'll have to like country music or grudgingly admit that Mom actually has decent taste in music.   My mom like talk radio.  And Elvis.  My kids have it so much better than I did.  Talk radio.   Elvis.  AM Radio ONLY in Mom's care.    See ya.

       I figured that I couldn't consider myself to be all that tech savvy until I had a blog.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So, poof!&nbsp; Here's my blog.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Now, the way I understand this, I can bitch and/or rave about whatever I want for as long as I want as many times as I want?&nbsp; And it costs nothing huh?&nbsp; I like the sounds of this!&nbsp;    &nbsp;  This could be the start of a beautiful relationship!

      Since they have predicted the "BIG ONE"  is imminent AGAIN..........I thought it might be interesting to check out what's going on underground.    It's educational and should kill a few minutes for the kids who are bored and out of school.  Yes, we are getting a little desperate for entertainment and this killed about 7 minutes.  Sigh.  You can even sign up to be notified and then you should get a page or an email right in the middle of your mad panic---it's actually pretty cool as long as it's not a big one and you're unaware of it.  Otherwise you know,  there you are trying to avoid large falling objects and hey "you've got mail!"  I don't know about you but am I really going to care at that point???    There are constant quakes all the time.  It really is pretty interesting.  Let's see,  where are we at now,  Africanized Bee Attacks,  West Nile Virus and The Big One.  Is it just me or does it feel like we royally pissed off Mother Nature???    Call me paranoid............you won't be the first.  You won't even be the first  today !!  urlLink Recent Earthquakes for Los_Angeles
