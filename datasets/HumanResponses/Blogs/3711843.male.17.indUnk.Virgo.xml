      France lost zero-one 'coz of some Greek midfielder and his perfect cross.  Why, oh why Zizou did you not score a comeback like that 'gainst England?  I earnestly hope that Zinedine will still play on World Cup '06.  They stink, don't they?   That, they do. You read my mind.

      Why are there cows roaming the street? Just this morning, while heading for school...   Heading for school? On a weekend?   Yes, Adam. I'm at school. My head was just pounded flat by questions involving inverse hyperbolic functions. Happy now?   Maybe...   Now, back to the cows...   You live near an agricultural area. Isn't that reason enough?   Then why are the cows  roaming around ? Shouldn't they have a pen or something?

      You know things will go bad when a government station has sole right to show a great sporting event, while the votes from last month's election are still being counted.  Lo and behold! Yesterday was the proclamation day, and some people didn't want that. So they ranted on and on about cheating and stuff. I missed the Germany-Czech Republic match! And for what?  These people don't know the first thing about shock. Ever since the election - May 10, Philippine Standard Time - the opposition's been ranting about massive cheating and various versions of "I wuz robbed!" speeches. C'mon! If you have evidence, show it all at once to the proper people, and stop repeating it every damned day. If you do, the people'll tire of your rants and dismiss you for someone who can't stand defeat.  No, I'm not pro-GMA - Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the diminutive Philippine prez. I hate her. But if you plan on proving her sleaziness, you do it with finesse. The people here have a saying: Nobody loses; either you win or you're cheated. That's how tired we are of hearing claim after claim of vote manipulation. You do it with sufficient evidence - that's important - and in proper time - which is equally important.  Let's leave this all behind. France will win Euro 2004. Any other result would be a scam!   And the pot calls kettle black.

      I've decided to abandon the "Marry Willow" Project, due to the following event:  Yesterday, as I sleep, a question came to me. It was vague at first, then it grew louder, then I heard it clearly. It said:   If Willow has 200 nails and a butcher's knife, how much pain would you experience before you die?   Then the voice faded, and I woke up. Scary.

      Should have posted this yesterday, but Nature hates me, and she brought a storm over UP, causing a blackout.  So, I had to abandon the plan, and go early to my next class. Which was nice for me because the professor was kinda strict.  Maybe Nature doesn't hate me that much after all...   You remember the sturgeon that crawled its way to your pants.   Yeah. Nature still hates me.  Anywhen...  I proposed to Willow yesterday. She said no. I think I'll have to go to the next level.   Ooh...what's that?   Courtship...and commitment. Or something like that.   Wait, wait, wait. You saying you never did this  before  you proposed?   I would have if  YOU HAVEN'T PRESUMED TO TELL HER OF MY PLAN!!!    Eeep.

      After a month of reading nothing but Clancy - Tom Clancy, to those who might think of any other person - I've finally returned to Prof. Tolkien's works. I'm reading the Silmarillion!  Everytime I read  the  books after a long absence, I gain new insight into Arda. So now, I'll do something smart, and place those wayward thoughts here.   Arda Thought No. 1  Lothlorien is the biggest work of art ever made. Or something like that.

      I don't get it. I forgot to bring my jacket one day, and it rained so bad I think I found three sharks swimming in my shirt. Now, prompted by the ominous clouds outside the house, I bring my jacket. And it was sunny. The whole day! Argh!   And the point is...   I dunno. It sounded good.   Right.

      First, I obey out of love.  Then, I obey out of desire to prove them wrong.  There may come a time when obey I will no more, for I cannot change how they see me.
