       Can i claim to be who i am. The person im staring at in the mirror. Is he really i? Or am i just dreaming, one day waking up with another totally different personality as a totally different person, with a totally different life. Thoughts of such run through my head.       My existence. As i continue to journey through my life, i lose more and more of my consciousness, and i begin to realise... just how much of this is real.. What if this whole thing called my life was just a dream where i would wake up and never remember.      Im a christian and i believe that when i pass away, i will go on to be with God in heaven for eternity. But it doesnt stop thoughts from creeping into my mind. Thoughts of, what is eternity? Can there really be a forever? These short 75 years of an average human life if im even blessed with, what are they. The lives which we pass, are they just a repetition with our existences reliving it everytime we pass on, or is it forever etched in time once its passed, never to come back.      What is the Meaning of this all... What is the purpose... This moment im spending right now to type this all out... It will be passed, never again returned.. That much of a value i cannot describe, that i wish to savour whole heartedly, yet cannot...      How i wish, things were just so simple but they arent.....      "Time passes me by as i sit and listen,   cries of folly, shouts of joy, happiness in abundance.   time it seems, we just have so much to spare,   what we don't realize is that time is not so keen to share.   what's passed, done and finished is over,   we will not be able to go back and start all over....."

       Let the lyrics speak for themself today      Pink Floyd - Time       "Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day   You fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way   Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town   Waiting for someone or something to show you the way   Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain   You are young and life is long and there is time to kill    And then the one day you find ten years have got behind you   No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun   And you run and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking   And racing around to come up behind you again   The sun is the same in the relative way, but you're older   And shorter of breath and one day closer to death   Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time   Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines   Hanging on in quiet desparation in the English way   The time is gone the song is over, thought I'd something more to say"      Relish in the remaining moments of your life... while you still have time....

       Staring at this blinking cursor... It gives my mind many thoughts and lets it formulate many conclusions. Something about its continuity that grants me certain peace and solace.       Sitting here thinking, am i doing the right thing? What should be the right thing in the first place. Regretting? hmm i definitely hope not for this will be the first time... I have always been so sure, so positive of my actions and never have i once looked back to say that sucks and i should not have done that. Why am i doing so now? What's going on.....      Pride, honour, Promise.... You can lose it all but these... They will be with you till your very end and eventually for humans, will be the measure of their worth. Am i worthless? Does it really matter? or am i just doing it to please... Who can i please if i cannot even please myself..      My cries for help go unnoticed, unheard.. The people around me all keep smiling, keep moving in the herd... Gradually i learned to accept, to forget... That as myself an individual, it doesnt matter much who cares or who doesnt.. Whose to know whats true and whats false.. Whats the point..      Will i regret writing this eventually? No... i wont... But will i regret actions i take in my life like one i have just done... Maybe.. Sadly.. Maybe.. It is an eventuality which even i fear i will face but hold on i will.....      "suffering but i have no regret,   this pain how can i ever forget.   misery which stretches to unknown degrees,   my life spells out to the finality of tragedy.   dreaming, wishing, hoping for the sadness to be taken away,   only to be dissappointed, let down,    left alone eventually...."

       Want.....      Is it necessity or pure selfish desire.. We want many things in life.. Career, contentment, money, food and the list goes on. But what is actually necessary and what is just due to plain old selfish desire. Have we ever stopped to think about it?       I need that!! I want that!! Buy it for me!! Get it for me!! Sound familiar? Many a times i have been guilty of selfish desire, but at that moment of time, i don't really notice it myself. My mother always tells me that she will one day hire a cameraman to follow me around and video record every single thing i say and do. She says that i will definitely not even recognize myself if i were to watch the video.       Personally, i hate to agree with that but i would think its true. Sometimes i know myself that i am unreasonable and demanding but i will deny all such accusations at that point of time. Its only after the whole matter has passed on when i will actually realize and think about my actions and how selfish they were. Necessary? Most of the time no... Most of the time my actions were purely of selfish desire.. Afterall we humans by nature are selfish people.      What is this strange feeling called desire? Why do we desire? Desire is more then just simple want, its somewhat of a craving, of a need... We suffer from desire just like how drug addicts suffer without their drugs... Can we ever learn to break free from these bonds and chains called desire binding us to this material plane? Or will we forever be slaves to materialism and forever feed the great fuel of desire and let it grow into a great big blaze.      "Her smiles ever so melting, makes all in place.   Her touch ever so haunting, a wind's caress could never replace.   Her laughter, angels chanter, reminds me of heaven.   Oh how i thank god with all my heart, for depriving heaven of her grace."

       Its not my fault. How many times in life have you heard these magical words uttered which seems to be able to shift the blame away from yourself.  Many times in life, we are all guilty of using these simple yet powerful words. Not my fault that happened. Not my fault this happened.    Well whose fault is it then? Before muttering those words without thinking, do we actually spare a thought to think about whether or not the situation might have been different if our actions had been different? So does it mean that it is not your fault and that the situation will still be the same if you had done pursued a different set of actions totally?      Like it or not, whatever actions we choose to do, it will in the end, affect those around us. Suicide will only result in loved ones breaking down and mourning over the loss. Betrayal will only cause those betrayed to be bitter and teach them to be more negative about life which is totally unnecessary. And love, well it can be both good and bad.. Ultimately, our actions, WILL affect those who are in immediate proximity to us.      Think for your actions are consequential. A simple lie can lead to great disaster and misunderstandings. A frown can sow discord and break relationships. And on the other hand, a simple smile can grow to a beautiful friendship which can be kept till the end of your life. Will you choose to act selfishly? or selflessly.. Make the choice, take the plunge but whatever it is, dont regret your choice for things in life can come and go, but choices we make will stick and be with us till we lie in our graves.      "Saw your smile, felt your grace,   Entered a place called heaven,    wished it wouldnt displace.   Dreamt of kisses, Sensations of love,   Woke up alone, lying in that bed so cold.   The grip of that hand, the firm affirmation,   guides me closer, to what you call salvation.   My actions all lead me, all let me confirm,   that what i do is not entirely of me,   but totally for you....."

       urlLink   "Hello, Good morning, How you Do" Lyrics from Switchfoot - Learning to Breathe   When was the last time you actually greeted a friend with a proper greeting as such?    Do you take things for granted, that you will see your friend again or do you actually treasure every single moment spent with that companion.      When you smile, do you actually realise what you are doing? You can either be making somebody's day turn from bad to good or.. You could just be cheating the person if you didnt mean the smile. People see me smile, hear me laugh, but can they be sure it is for real? Have they ever stopped to think, wait a minute, he can't be laughing at this can he?       Personally, i take the good with the bad and whatever the situation, i believe in smiling. Even if its a forced smile where i have to cram up the corners of my lips, i force myself to do so. If i really have to force myself to smile i am in fact contradicting myself but i will do so because one sad person is enough... The world is full of sad faces, take the time to look around. Enjoy the lush scenery you see and ignore the frowns. Smile and be greeted with another smile and slowly, slowly all will be back in place....      "As people age, As people grow,   They lose their sense, they make more foes.   Frowns a plenty, mostly blamed on responsibility,    Life they say, has taken such a toll.   Childish are acts which seem insensible to them,   but whose to say whose grown up when?   All one can do is smile and wait,    time will tell, chase your fate."

       Dreams.. Im sure every single one of us have them. Not just your simple crazy dreams of school life or adventures. But dreams of falling in love, getting married and even death.  What do dreams actually represent? Desire? Direction? Or are dreams really merely an indication of things to come.      Yesterday's dream was particularly intriguing. The whole dream was full of action and it involved all the people whom i were close to in my life. The most interesting aspect of it was that my hands were amputated halfway throughout (why though i still do not know why) and those people started to leave one by one. Suprisingly though, in my dream i did not cry when that happened. I only smiled and laughed as the dream ploughed on and finally only ending when i woke up in cold sweat. The dream really troubled me for a portion of the morning. It made me wonder what was my subconscious mind really feeling. Lyrics from a song Gary Jules - Mad World came to my head "And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had."      Do i really know myself and can claim to be in control of my mind. Or is there a possibility of me actually losing it. That dream really scared me as it seemed like there was a possibility indeed. Can i claim to know more then i actually know or is reality just a cruel mirror which shows nothing but voidness.          "Blatant lies are told everyday,   but your eyes seem to give the game away.   Where is truth, has it lost its way,   another broken promise, another dismay.   Where i have cried, where i have died,   i can only hope and pray to see a better day."

       Have you ever truly felt alive? What does it mean to be alive? To be able to see, hear, touch, smell, taste? Is that what it truly means? Or is there something else that is lacking in order to complete this equation..      Today was just another day where it seemed like i wasn't alive. Simple day with hardly any real interactions with people face-to-face, everything but was of mere conversations through text and pictures. I realise the time on this kind of days past by more slowly then normal, why though i still wonder.      On days where i am with people it is of a different matter altogether. Be it a whole day or just a short hour, it seems like time flies when theres interaction with other human beings whilst in their prescence.       Why do some days feel and seem shorter then others? Does it really mean that time flies when your having fun? Our time on this earth is short and limited. Many times i have heard people lamenting about how their lives suck or how much they just wish to die.. If i could i would show them what i see, about how limited our time on this life actually is and how many things there is to be done. Compared to people whose lives have been taken away from them unwillingly, here we have selfish people wishing for theirs to be taken away.   I guess we really like to take things for granted...      You will lose your life eventually one day. Choose the way to go when its the end. Either be a loser who never once saw the bright of life, or be someone who realised how precious it can be.. People often tell me to slow down, to stop thinking so much. Personally when humans dont think thats when they err..       We dont think about where we are going, what we are doing and most importantly of the consequences. We say many things which we never mean to do eventually and we do many things which we come to realise and regret after the consequences are clear. Many times in life i have made that mistake and awful a mistake it is to make. To realise that there could have been another alternative and to have been able to be better. Or to realise that it could have been worse and to have ended up in a lousier situation.      Instead of feeling that i am thinking too much, maybe, just maybe, i should feel that i am thinking too little and i should think more....      "Time slips through hands like water on glass,    people feel that they have too many hours.   Minutes to kill, seconds to spare,   when they finally stop breathing, i hope they wont despair,   that time was too little, it just wasn't fair..."

       Today an old emotion that i had not felt for many years resurfaced... It was like a breath of fresh oxygen after diving in that deep blue sea for so long. I felt my lungs pumped, my mind energized but most importantly, i felt my heart beat once more.  The emotion that im speaking of is undescribable.. Have you ever felt happiness just by looking at the wide grin on that face? Have you ever felt joy by just hearing that laugh so innocent yet jovial? Has your spirits ever been raised by a companion who does so little but yet it seems so much?  I sure am glad that i have found this emotion once again. Be it temporary or permanent, it sure was a great relief from many other emotions i have been experiencing lately. Though i hope for it to last, the sad chorus from november rain - Guns and Roses of "Nothing lasts forever" just keeps playing.. Well forever is a long long time, and i know that on my part, forever will seem like just another day as long as i continue to experience and feel this emotion i am so grateful to feel...     "An Angels carress, so gentle yet full of feeling. A Demons words, so little yet full of fearing. Light from heaven fills my day, Dark from hell blinds my way. A child so innocent, so happy, so pure. How i wish, i hadn't learnt to adore......"

       3.30 am on a saturday night and here i am, doing a blog... something which i had laughed and scoffed at when i had seen so many other people doing and reading blogs. Ironically, i had said i was never going to be interested in doing a blog as i was not that sort of "person".. Well i guess i did not even realise what that sort of "person" was when i said those words out aloud..    Why the sudden interest in blogging? Sleepless nights + Nobody to talk to (besides God) + lack of stuff to do = blogging... But more importantly, i felt i needed somewhere or something where i could express myself freely.. free of being criticized at the instantenous action of making a stupid remark or a careless slip of my tactless tongue...      I was once asked a question, if you could change anything in your life, what would it be... At that point of time i had not thought the question through carefully and just spurted out a simple answer of "Nothing." I felt the lack of need to change anything that has happened in my life as anything different would not have made me the person i am today.. Thinking back on that question, if i were to be asked the same thing, i would answer the same way i guess... I would like to use this chance to say a big SORRY to anybody and everybody whom i have upset in any way or any manner.. be it a small let down to a big disappointment.. I want to say SORRY for being an insensitive jerk and for being the sorry person that i am.. There is only so much i can express verbally and through my words but i can only learn with each passing mistake and look up to those in heaven and pray as i smile on this earth still today..      Once more, sorry whoever you are, whereever you are.. Sorry for me being me...      "Time whiles by, as i sit here today.    Dreams of you, offer nought but comfort to my mind.    Thoughts going wild, people telling lies.    When will we learn to abandon this foolish masquerade, to drop our disguise..."
