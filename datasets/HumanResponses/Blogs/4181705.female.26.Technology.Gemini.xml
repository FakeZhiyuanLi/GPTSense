						   Isn't it ironic that the one person I  KNOW   loves  me... is the one person I can never be with?

						   I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders... Why is it that when one thing goes wrong, EVERYTHING goes wrong? I find that when I have a problem in any area of my life, social, family, career, personal, whatever it may be... something goes horribly wrong in all.  I hate uncertainty.  I hate not knowing... I'm not a control freak but I like to have some semblance of control when it comes to the outcome of certain situations in my life...   My Career:  I graduated with a BBA in Finance and Real Estate only to find out... I HATE IT!!! My first job out of college was in Insurance... I realize at this point, "Alicia, you couldn't sell water to a dehydrated man in the Sahara."  So I started my search and found something to do that I was happy doing.  I'm a behind the scenes kind of person.  I do what I do well... I get along with most of the people I work with, but I'm not happy with the person I work for.  It's the WHITE MAN's WORLD... that's for sure.  And being a non-white woman, makes it just a little harder...   My Social Life:  I have none.  I've grown into a hermit.  I'd rather be sitting doing nothing than to do something and realize that I'd rather be home doing nothing.  My idea of an exciting night is... MORE THAN ONE MOVIE FROM BLOCKBUSTER... Or a marathon of the World Series of Poker.... But I'm good with this... You can't get into trouble at home...   My Love Life:  Something else I don't have.  The most uncertainty lies here.  I don't know what to say, when to say it, what to do... You get the point.  I don't know how to feel about the situatuon.  I don't even know if I should feel anything. It kinda hurts when someone barrels into your heart and become so much to you and you realize you're nothing to them.   My Family:  Old West Indian people can try my damn patience... "HOLLA, if you hear me!"... Enough said...

						   You asked me yesterday, questions that I answered with much certainty. Why? Those are the answers I achieved through my own mistakes. I have never been one to learn from the mistakes of others, that's just me being stubborn and hardheaded. You on the other hand... if I may... are one of the realest people I've come to know. Your smile is infectious, your laughter like a plague, your demeanor - OUTSTANDING... You truly are a wonderful person...     BUT....

						   Everytime I hear a story of heart break... it saddens me... My story, well it's a little different... I broke my own heart.   I was involved in a relationship that lacked honesty, understanding, compassion, respect and trust.  Even though this relationship ended nearly 5 years ago... It's still the 'ONE' I can look back on and say... "I learned something."  The only thing I've learned since then is that the game is all the same... just on different levels.  When I was involved in the game, it was harder for me to see what was coming... Now that I've turned my back on the games... I can see it more clearly.  Here's my analogy... I'm a Wheel of Fortune freak. It's been my favorite since I was a little kid...  Every night I sit and watch.  And every night I say the same thing... "I need to get on this show and win some money!" But this is the catch... Would I still do as well on the show as opposed to sitting at home and watching?  Probably not... This is why I choose to look in on situations as opposed to actually being in the situation itself.   I've spent the last 5 years alone... by choice.  The first two years were difficult.  I self destructed.  I did everything out of character... and then in 2000... I stopped.  I decided to figure out who I was... And here we are... 2004 and by George... I think I got it!!! Well not completely... but I'm getting there.  I've started letting people in again... Well one person, let me not get carried away here...

						   My entire life has been spent on trying to fulfill my 'dream'. The dream we all have... the one we work towards. I can't even begin to understand what I should do... now that I know my dream will never be realized. My question now is, "Where do I start building my dreams again?" I've worked all my life towards something I don't want!!!  I've learned that we should never judge people on potential. We all have "potential"... but how many of us actually   realize our full potential?   I want to be someone that can at least come close to that realization. I will not perpetuate the cycle of school, marriage, kids, career, retirement... Who said life has to be that way? Mind you... I want all those things but if somewhere along the way someone told you... "you can't do _________ (any of the above)," would you want some of it, if you couldn't have it all? I've been told my entire life to never do things halfway... Do I want children without marriage? Or marriage without children? Years of school and no career? Retirement from what?  I'm only 26 but my mind is OLD... Old fashioned, traditional, whatever you want to call it... I've started losing faith in humans... I've consistently been disappointed by the actions of others whether they are female or male... I've lived in a belief that every generation will try to do better than the ones before them. Do I see this in my generation? Yes, but only a little... Do I see this in the generations after me? No... And it scares me. Why would I want to have kids? Why would I want to raise them in this crazy world? I see my little 4 year old cousin and get so disappointed to know that at the age of 10 he'll be more grown than I was at 13.
