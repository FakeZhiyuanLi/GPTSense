       Well, I had about a total of 4 hours sleep last nite!!! But actually, funnily enough i'm not as tired as I'd thought I'd be! I feel like it's Sunday, I always feel like it is a differnet day to what it actually is. Mel started being a Russian ballerina  like she'd promised at 2.30am in the morning, 'cept her name was Adolf Hitler and she kept doing the salute Hitler sign, so it was more like German ballet. Haha, it was funny. Helen was laughing so much she was practically falling off the couch!  Well, neway, I jsut decided I'd tell u 'bout Luke's b'day party, which was...hmmm...let me think, last Saturday, yeh that's it. And Pip M-H couldn;t come because she onyl got the e-mail invitaion the day AFTER the party. haha. Poor Pip. Well neway, the party was in his warheouse thingo, and we had these two little fire things which were really nice and warm, 'cept all the guys kept on blowing the embers so I got burnt!! *sniff sniff* And Monty was kicking around the coals on the ground, and now I've got little holes in the bottoms of mi thongs from stepping on fire embers! :p But we got to toast marshamllows, and we put a disgusting banana  in  the fire, and charred and cooked it it was sooo disgutsing, and Mel threw cornchips in the fire because it amused her to see all the sparks come off it! Haha, and they all melted, it was so funny.  We watched 'Love Actually' which was good, cuz come on, who desn't love love actually!? It's great! And during the movie all the girls were like "Awwwwww....." every 2 secs and the guys just sat there laughing at us because we found it sweet, especially Pete Banning, man he found it hilarious! And during the movie (because beforehand a massive peiece of that yellow insulating stuff fell on Luke's head, and then we saw a possum in a hole in the roof where the stuff had jsut fallen) the possum shat on Bec's shoulder, it was sooo disgusing, then it slid off her shoulder onto the ground and she stepped on it!! Yuck!  Now moving on to a different topic, the other night, last Friday i think, Ernie people went to the beach because of the Ethiopian people who came to our church. And the becah was really fun, we mainly just mucked around on the beach and played touch footy and frisbee and talked and stuff. On the way to the beach Gem and KC and I went in a car with T1 (Tim McCloud)and Rob, and I was telling them about the "Church Gossip Tree" and it was really funny, cuz I'm just like, "I know a secret about you, and you, and you...." 'cept of course I wouldnt' tell them because I'm good at keeping secrets! :D And I tried to sell 'Speedo Joel' T-shirts on Hannah W's behalf. Hehe. She's actually gonna seriouly make them. And after the beach we went to the park for dinner and played games there and stuff, and every1 ATTACKED the BBQ Meatlovers Pizza! And on the way back in the car we were with T2 (Tim Buckley) and we had 'Tim Time' where he had to tell us about himself. Man, it was a fun night.  Well neway, bi bi Beth

       Hey, hey Long time no see, ay? Well, I am at Helen's house now and we are having a very fun, girly sleepova. Right now I am sitting in the cold, cold room (no heater or fire) with mi sleeping bag wrapped around me and hardly being able to read the keys (so please excuse the typos! :p) at 2:00am in the morning. We haven't slept one little bit, all the sugar and cafefine we have consumed is doing its job! Out of every1 here, Mel, Pip L, Pip M-H, Steph S, Hannah, Gemma, Helen, Rach (Casey and Rach left earlier cuz they couldnt sleep ova) only Steph is asleep, and the rest of us (but mainly Mel) are pretty active!!  So far, we've watched Finding Nemo - yay! Which was REALLY cute, and was the first time I'd actually seen the whole thing with no interuptions, because the other time I was babaysitting Grace and she kept on calling me so I had to leave while the movie was on so I missed heaps of it, but meh, I saw it this time! We consumed copius amounts of sugar during the movie, and Helen was very successful in making a really good fire to keep us warm!! And we had lots of girly chats, with Helen reciting the events of her first kiss in French, and Rach giving a very funny translation. (Helen: ( in French )"It happened one day in spring..." Rach: ( her "translation" in English ) "And he slowly leaned forward, and I could smell the garlic bread he had previously eaten..."  Mel and Hannah and I were praying outside b4, which was really good, we were joking that the spiritual effects of this house were rubbing off on us! We sat outside in the freezing cold because everywhere we went in the house to pray some1 kept on running into us!!  Right now I think that every1 is about to go to sleep and we are in the process of setting the alarm 4 about 7:45am in the morning (ugh-WAY too early 4 me!!) as usual Mel is still on a high, even though we are going to "sleep" now. And i think i can hear her talking about nuts, beautiful, fabulous conversation from u there Mel, thanks 4 that if u read it!! Everyone is suspecting that I'm writing bout them and Gemma is telling me "To keep it quiet because the keys are too loud!", and Helen is all like "What are you writing about us?" haha. I'm writing exactly what ur saying!!! muhahahaha.... im watching!  well newayz, movin on, this nite was pretty fun, and rach want me to get off so she can write her blog, but i just wanna add that i got mi 1st exam back the otha day, art and i got 92% - yay! And Hannah Wiseman got full makrs! Man, she is good. Ok well, gtg.  Blogging off, Beth

       Hey, this is my first ever blog! Well, apart from school of course. I first heard about blogger.com when we had to do an English assignment. This involved making a blog on an Aboriginal issue (quite boring and formal actually!!) ( visit my groups blog by clicking  urlLink here ) And also mi friend Mel has a blog, actually once i get her blog address from her I'm gonna link it here so you can all read about the little green dwarf that was actually Superman! FUN FUN!  Newayz...today I had cheerleading! Yay! I'll just blab on about this 4 a bit. Well, we met our coach and her name was Melissa and she had a really cool Canadian accent. We learnt a motion drill thingo and then a dance. We also practiced stunts, but that was bit boring and painful seeing as I had to be base and i didn't get to be flyer this week!(grr....) Sarah had a bit of trouble with the dance, but ya know...She'll get it in time.  OMG, I've got exams next week! Ahh...totally stressing, especially 4 French, French is nerveracking because you don't know exactly what they'll want u to do!! Mel and I r gonna study this weekend, and maybe Annie might come as well. I'm bludging going to my brothers' cycling this weekend as well! Mi god, its sooooo boring going to that, and it's all the way at Homebush as well. John (mi brothers coach) is here right now with Callum's new bike, its a surprise I think, its sposed to be really good, has like optic fibers or something, i dunno, i honestly couldn't care less about bikes and cycling, even though most of my family and uncles and cousins from my dad's side do!  Yesterday I went to mi ice-skating lessons (or maybe I'm sposed to call it "figure" skating...meh) and we had this really nice sub lady called Judy. She was REALLY sweet, at the end of the lesson she said  "raise your right hand in the air, put it on your right shoulder and pat your back, because you've done great this lesson!"  and she was a really good teacher too - i learnt how to do mi backward slalom, backward crossovers and backward two foot turn to forwards. At the end of the lesson she was teaching us how to draw pictures on this ice with our skates and we drew pineapples and Easter bunny's, and then i was just fiddling around and doing random things and then I did this weird thing with my foot and i like spun it round me or something and then suddenly she looks at me and goes  "oh my gosh, you just did a 3 inside foot turn, and that's like level 10!"  (and I'm in level 6) and I'm like cool, and then Gem and I were just doing the 3 thing and all these random cross things and we looked sooo impressive it was really cool!  Ugh! I've got Open Day tomoz! I've gotta do mi English blog thingo and mi French slideshow and that'll take like 2 hours. It'll be boring but at least mi friends will be there!! But Reynolds is making us wear our BLAZERS!!! Mi god, I  hate  Reynolds so much! But at least we get our Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I was gonna do gymnastics as well 4 Open Day, 'cept we have to wear our leotards so I scrapped that idea!  Wow, I've got cafe church this Sunday! Woo..I think Annie's gonna come, ya know you're sposed to invite friends and wateva. It'll be cool, there's coffee (haha - not that i like it anyway) and food (Casey was  very  pleased with that fact...hehe) and yeh...church is fun always neway...except now that a certain sum1 i think has been avoiding me...but neway, it'll probably all blow over soon.                                  ----------------    Salut, Je m'apelle Elizabeth. Ja'i quatorze ans. Mon anniversarie trente-trois, janvier, mille neuf-cent quatre-vingts dix. J'habite a Frenchs Forest, a Sydney, en Australie, dans une grand maison. J'ai deux cadets freres.

       Hey, I hav2 go to Canberra tomorrow. I sooo don't want to! It'll be cold, and boring, seeing as I have to go there because of mi brothers cycling competiton. Sure, Casey's coming, and that some consolation, but I am still dreading going. It's a hole, i really hate Canberra! So I won't be able 2 blog 4 5 whole days, or go on MSN or nething. The only contact I will hav with the outside world is mobile phone. So everyone who has mi number must SMS me so that I can be saved from boredom! This is my plea to everyone.  Well, today. Today was a pretty boring day. I mainly slothed around and did nothing. Fun Fun. I watched this random movie on Movie1 called  urlLink "Frailty"  about this random family that goes around and kills "demons", actual people who have done nothing wrong, but the father says that they have and that God has given him this list of "demons" to hunt down and kill. It is very random. But it's not that bad actually. Just really creepy.  So overall mi day was pretty average. 'Cept 4 two people, who I won't name (u know who u r) who were being bitches 2 me (1 more than the other, but it was still mean) Doesn't matter if they don't go through with it, it is still mean. And I'm upset that you guys could do that. And thats all I hav 2 say Bloggin off, Beth  p.s 2 see Luke's long john's click  urlLink here  - they r seriously funni and freaky!

       Luke and I got 2getha 4 a nice chat this arvo at Glenrose. We went 2 tha coffee place. 'Cept I was sooooo full that I couldn't eat or drink nething. So Luke was left 2 hav coffee bi himself. Han and KC joined us 4 'bout 10 mins, then had 2 go home. Han kept on giving very unsubtle hints, and Bianca... ok maybe I should stop here. Neway, it was nice. :D Good talk, good company. The 45 mins went quite quickly and b4 long we were walking back towards Mimosa and Davo and the bus stop, 'cept Luke had 2 run 4 the bus. Hope I didnt' make him miss it. Oops. I had 2 detour 2 pick up mi little bro. I'm glad we finally got sum time 2 talk (bi the way I'm talking bout Luke not mi bro - i get too much time with him!) outside of all the technological communication devices. :) We should do it more often. Fun Fun. Blogging off, Beth  p.s we hav sold our first Speedo Joel merchandise! :D Luke's long john's. haha, they r the funniest thing u could possibly eva see!

       Ok, I had a pretty good day 2day. It started with both Hannah and Casey being very late 2 arrive at mi house. Hannah missed her first bus and was stranded at Chatswood while some hobo chased her round saying "Help me find my family! I've lost them!" Haha, would only happen 2 Hanni.... Casey, being the lazy bum she is, slept in and didn't get round 'till 10.30! We had 2 giv her a wake up call. And we pranked her house and left a message on the answering machine saying,  "Hello, this is Dr. Al-Ka-Sher-Ba from the pregnancy clinic, and we have Mr. B Hinde's test reults. (KC's bro) Could you please call back as soon as possibe on 9451 8117. Thanks!"  Once both parties arrived, we basically did, well nuthing!! We had the music up very loud tho. Taking full advantage of Foxtel digital by using their new radio channels. :D And we went onto sum randoms blog and told him Casey wanted 2 go out with him. And we successfully managed 2 cut off a lock of Casey's hair!! Excellent... Then came the infamous pizzas....  We decided 2 order pizzas, and Hannah called up hoping 2 speak 2 Dougie, but she got sum random ass lady, who said,  "That will be $17.20. Thanks! Bye!"   And hung up, while we stood there baffled, because it was only 'sposed 2 be $14.95 and we didn't have enuf money. So we spent the next half an hour trying 2 figure out how 2 get $2 (possible solutions - sell lemonade, sell hannahs fone, beg, busk, ask pizza guy 2 let us off $2 because our dog had died and finally, to sell casey) Eventually I just put in sum of mi Noumea money. SO neway, the pizza guy was realli late, and Casey goes,  "Wouldn't it be funni if your Mum came home right now!"  She jinxed it!! Then about 2 seconds later, mi Mum drove down the driveway, while the pizza guy was following the car (we weren't realli allowed 2 order pizza we don't think) So we're like  "Shit, she's home!"  And KC and Hanni ran into mi room 2 hide, and so i went outside 2 face the music, and the pizza guy had disappeared!! Like totally vanished. So Mum had come home from school just 2 put out the washing, and we were offering 2 help her, 2 get her out of the house quickly, but she wouldn't let us. She ended up going tho! Finally! We got away with it! So the pizzas STILL hadn't arrived and there was the mystery of the missing pizza dude. We could hear his motorbike in the background. So Hanni called up the lady 2 complain. And she's like  "Blah, Blah, Blah, I don't care!"  and so we hung up, and then the doorbell rang and it was the pizza guy, and to Hanni's dismay, he wasn't hot. He was like 60 and ugly! He denied he got lost when KC asked him, but we think he was lying just 2 save face! :P So we ate our pizzas, forcing ourselves to eat 5 pieces each!! Ahhh, we were like bursting!! So that was mi fun day with KC and Hanni! :O We had fun and we were doing nuthing! Yay! Dats what friends r 4...

       Some good advice here from Luke:   .. sumtimes I wonder if anyone will eva luv me... but then i remember that god is there, and thats got to count for a heck of a lot... and he also has a plan for who i will end up with, my dad prays for them every night, i think i should too... its exciting to know (or not know rather) whats installed for me... all i know is that there is no way it will not be good... sure there will be hard times where i feel like giving up, but in the long run it will be worth it...

       I hav a lot 2 blog about. I kept on thinking, "this is a bloggable thought" but I couldn't realli blog seeing as Gemma was here. Hannah bailed out on me and dind't come ova becuase she got food poisining from eating sum random deep-fried carrot ball. Silly, silly. She knows not 2 eat random weirdo food when ur waitressing. Tsk. Tsk. So that helped accentuate mi depressed mood. I got Gem 2 come ova so I could mask the sadness. It came back of course. Always does. This time in Church. I was singing and i felt this overwhelming sadness come over me, because the music made me think about stuff, and i didn't want 2, i just wanted it 2 be me and God, no-one else, but I couldn't help it, and it was weird because i felt so sad I couldn't stand any more, and I sat down and just prayed and cried a bit (but not so much so that evry1 would notice) and God helped and when I got up I still felt a bit sad but better, and it was just me and God this time so all those thoughts could get out of mi head 4 a while. It was good.  But Dance was fun. Gem and I rocked up and Pip L and Jodie and Nat and Ash were there and they had a table and they had bought lunch, so we joined in, they had tinned pears, crackers, vita-weats, philadelphia cream cheese, yoghurt, plain chips, and caramel tim-tams. It was yummi, 'cept it made dancing hard!! The dance was majorly complicated. I dunno how I am eva gonna get it!! Ahhh... And we spent a lot of the time rolling into each otha, funni, but we were paying 4 it afta with lots of pain!! I'm so physced about doing this dance at EBN next term! Yay.  Nite Church was cool. Well apart from the aforementioned incident, but y'know that got betta as well. Luke and I got more talking time than we usually do so that was good :D  Sucked in 2 every1 who had 2 go to skool 2day. I went and saw 'Mean Girls' with Bubs, Loz,  urlLink Hanni ,  urlLink Casey  and Jess. it was quite good actually, realli funni. Im getting the DVD off Julia, along with 'Secret Window' (REALLI good, 1 of mi new fave movies, i suggest every1 see it) and 'Honey' (nutha good movie, but prolly just 4 tha girls, or guys who wanna perve on the half-naked girls in the movie and r into hip-hop...weird :D) So yeh, that was mi Sunday and 2day. Blogging off, Beth  p.s I'm so excited bout what Gemma told me last nite!! Ahhhh....

       Well today was one of the best days I've had in a long, long while. Last days of term always are! And  urlLink Mel  always misses them! She hasn't been there 4 1 4 like the past yr. Oh, well her loss.   The day started of with artt with Criddy, where we were forced to clean up, Han and I turned the radio up REAL loud and danced around until she screamed at us to stop, but we ignored her neway! Then afta we'd finished wiping the benches, we had 2 clean out the art cupboard which like hasn't been cleaned since 1985. We complained about doing it so now she's giving us all (Han, Gem and I) a Killer Python Gummi Snake. Mmmmm... bribing with lollies always works! So we were cleaning out this closet, and we closed the door behind us, and its like a mini claustrophobic room, and we saw that the window was bricked up so we were scared that Simba and Hammy and Criddy were gonna brick us in so we opened it again :D Han proceeded 2 pick things up off the ground with pliers, and we pulled at this piece of string 4 ages until we realised it was in a big roll. Criddy came 2 see how we were going and she got her feet tangled up in all the string and didn't know and was walking around the room like a lunatic with all this yellow string around her feet, it ended up falling off, but man we were shitting ourselves laughing 4 a long time there!  Next up was Maths, and as a "treat" as Mr.Ryan put it we watched the "Right-Angled Triangle" video. Traumatising stuff really. 4 any of u Roseville girls out there, that includes ur Rach, u should know  exactly  wat I'm talking about. 4 others, just try and imagine this crazy lady, with 80's clothes (think puffy cuffs) and permed hair. A high-pitched voice and MASSIVE eyes, banging on a triangle singing - "Right Angled Triangle, Right Angled Triangle, equals the square of the hypotonuse...." It is soooo scary and funni. Oh, and I once again tripped ova Mr. Ryan. oops :P  Den we had morning tea, and there was a cake stall, and a MASSIVE line 4 Krispy Kreme donuts. Slaves were sold, and most of them went 4 about $30 (rip-off!) but Batsey sold 4 $50!! Walking back to our spot we saw many Year 12's giving piggy-backs to their "masters" and crawling down the Hinemoa stairs. Crazy. We had to clean-up during Tutor Time and I finally got to swap lockers with Shannon (grr....) so now I am TOP LOCKER!!!!! woooooo......  Then we had Science, we did this sheet with tests 4 our eyes, to see blind spots and stuff, and we had 2 try and trace around a star by only looking in a mirror. It's harder than it seems! but it was fun. Then Annie and I proceeded 2 have leg fights bi swinging on the lab desks,a nd running around screaming and jumping ova chairs. Good 'ol Mrs. Hallet let us have our fun :D Then Annie ran out of the class and came back with a balloon and blew it up and it was really long and fat, so we played with it then decided 2 call it "Annie and Beth's End of Term Eggplant" and we got everyone 2 sign it. It was majorly cool!  In English we watched the end of Baz Lhurman's Romeo and Juliet, which mite I say is really crap. It's got Leo DiCrappio as Romeo, so all ur thinking about is Titanic the whole time, he even smokes like Titanic, speaks like Titanic, draws like Titanic, swims like Titanic and looks cold like Titanic. Man it's like a copy. And why, may i ask, is Mercutio a  cross-dresser ?! That neva happened in the play. It's a totally retarded movie. But we got 2 see Hammy's new haircut which is totally hanous!! It is short and bob-ish and is lighter brown and she has a fringe, its so unco! Han and I had 2 stifle our laughter wen she walked past and we saw her 4 the first time this morning.  Lunch started with us waiting in a line 4 like an hour, only 2 find out it was the drink line, and then we had 2 wait in a mosh pit of a line (u couldn't even really classify it as a line!) 4 another 15mins 2 get our sausage!! We were suffocated!! When we got back 2 the locker rooms, we found out that the list 4 who got into Middle School Performing Arts was up!!  AND WE GOT IN!!!!!!  We were so damn excited! Because hardly anyone got in!! And we did! Wow! And we beat Amelia and Lucy, they didn't even get in, and they thought they totally would, and they r pretty good. But they were sooo pissed with us that we got in and they didn't and they were crying and everything, and bitching about us and giving us greasys as well, but i didn't care because I was so happy. And then Sian and Kelly were annoyed because Amelia and Lucy wanted 2 be in their dance and they didn't want 2 (because they got in) and they were sooo pissed. And Kim Asjberg didn't get in!! haha....and she had a physco and started bitching bout Jen and Millie's group that got in and I told them so they were angry at Kim and Kim was crying that she sisn't get in and everything. It was soo hilarious. And we went 2 tell our group, and they were having this full-on God discussion and didn't want 2 listen 2 us, and they were totally oblivious 2 everything going on around them! haha  So now.....Cheerleading with Melissa NSC what 2 say. She's a freak. She was feeling espescially bitchy 2day, and we were trying 2 learn an  urlLink Elevator  stunt, which is a promotion from our usual boring  urlLink Thigh Stand  and it is really hard 2 do (the elevator) and i had sum1's foot in mi face and it was killing me and I was collapsing under her weight, and she's like u two (Han and I who were the bases) leave and let's get 2 other bases. We were like "Fine! Bitch!" It was quite mean. She totally hates us. We got her 2 sign our eggplant balloon, and she gave us a weird look, but did it neway, and she wrote -  "Cheer hard or go home, Coach Mel"  What a weird message! And she attempted 2 draw this pic of a cheer person. It was funni. And she did more cheers 4 us - haha. "Push that ball, push that ball!" So yeh, that's our freako coach. I am now in so much pain from having people constantly stepping on me 4 2 hours straight, being base and all. But we combined our stunt stuff, by having a group on the outside doing thigh stand, middle doing elevator, other side doing thigh stand, and we all connected it together so it is like 1 big pyramid, and then we took a pic. :D I'll put it on the blog once I get it. But it's pretty cool. We look like we're really good.  But yeh, that was my day. It was pretty fun. I got mi report we I came home and I'm really happi :D They rank us out of all the people who take the subject and 4 English I came 1st out of 107 (1/107), Maths Advanced - 42/59 (so that was relativley shit, thats because the exam was realli hard and i shitted it up!!) Science - 29/104, CCG - 52/104 (haha - hate CCG!!!) CCH - 7/105, French - 3/25 (yay - worked hard 4 that 1 - we had 4 exams 4 half-yearly 4 the 1 subject!!) History - 2/66 ( I was No.1 for 1/2 hour, then Ai Lyn came and said "U didn't read mi last paragraph of the extended response", so she got an extra mark, and beat me bi half a mark! grrr.....) Visual Arts - 6/32  Oh and Mrs. Smart (CS) said I should "be more forthright in sharing mi ideas" which is absolute bull!! I always share mi ideas, its just because no1's listening 2 me, so when jess is presenting an argument, its usually mine, and im whispering next 2 her telling her what 2 say!! Ahhhh......that is sooo annoying!!  Well i betta go and start doing stuff B4 small group! Wow, that was prob. the longest blog I've eva done!!  Bloggin off, Beth

       Mrs. Smart once again decided to share with us her "extensive" knowledge of The Bible, by describing the book - "Song of Songs" as an erotic and pleasurable book that she suggests we read. So Jess, being interested as she always is, opened up to it and starting laughing at such verses as - "Your breasts are perfect; like twin deer feeding among lilies (Song of Songs 4:5)" And she comes up and says to Jess, "No Jess, that's for holiday reading only" Hahah...what is she on?  SO now we r in Civics Geography, one of the worst possible subjects, and we have to research holes. I am doing Cooma, NSW and it is the biggest hole in the world. I ashamed that it is to be associated with our state. They are rapidly losing their population, and you know what they have done to try and get people back? OK, wait for it!  Opened a Llama Farm!!  I am dead serious. These people are freaks. Mrs. Huge (aka. Mrs. Hughes) is "patrolling" She thinks I'm working, but how dumb is she - she never thinks to look down to mi minimised windows. So, so stupid. Haha, and MR. CASH has come in! He is like this physco butch stdent PDHPE teacher. He's a freak and annoying. And he follows Mrs. B around all the time. Ahh, the "Roseville Big Brother" people are wtahcing me!  And ASHLEY WACHMAN just walked past- she is mi stalkers sister. His name is Nick and he's really scary and he has bright orange hair. Mel and I met him at Lake Maquarie and he became obsessed with me. He would stand outside our door all day, and then one time he stood outside our door from 12.00pm to 2.00am no joke. He was sooo scary!! And he asked 4 mi number as well, and I gave him a fake 1. Felt bad, but u know, I had 2. I'm experienced with dealing with stalkers. I hav had a few. Its strange. I seem to hav a knack for attracting strange, scary and stalkeresque guys!! Ahhhh.... Better b off, bells gonna go in a minute, and then I hav freedom!! yay! Blogging off, Beth

       Well, I had an interesting morning this morning. Nearly as bad as Howie. I 4got 2 tell mi Mum 2 wake me up at 7.15 instead of the usual 7.30, so i get woken up at 7.30, screaming "Shit, Shit, Shit, KC's 'sposed 2 pick me up at 7.25!!!" I  jump  out of bed, and then I see Casey walking up to my door, I'm rushing to put mi clothes on, while Mi mum is trying to put lunch in mi bag, I rush out the door, ready in a record 30 secs (no over-exaduration) I jump in KC's car half-dressed, breakfast and hair-brush thrusted into mi hand, mi half-packed bag being dragged along behind me while at the same time I am busting 2 pee and are still half asleep. It ended up that once we got 2 the bus stop our bus was  20 minutes late!  So I ended up at school late anyway, and had no time 2 eat and get ready before I had 2 rush off to class! Torture, i tell you torture. Not 2 mention it was freezing!  Well, the infamous Criddy strikes again. 'Cept this time she's the FUN NAZI!! She arrives into class with her prostitute makeup on - think bright red lipstick and blue eyeshadow! (about 2 seconds after I rush in there half-ready) and has another physco at Hannah and I because we were pretendin 2 be DJ's and making lots of DJ like CD-scratching nosises -"Settle down girls!" she croaks (hahah - mission "antaginate Criddy" complete!) Mel decides to ask  WHY  she named her son Bead, and then she started 2 tell us about how it was actually spelt Bede, and " NO , it  IS NOT  short for anything!", and how it was one of the oldest most  amazingly wonderful  names in history. All this while we r trying 2 stifle our laughter. Mel started to ask her if she had had a haircut and Criddy took it all wrong, and had a physco at poor Mel who was just trying 2 make convo, and threatedned 2 send her up to Dr. Kamperos office! hehehe.....  Quite an eventful day. Although I arrived home feeling sick again! :(

       I spent most of mi day watching a TV movie about the  urlLink Martha Moxley  murder (seeing as I woke up at about 11.00) It was sooo sad. The murder was only recently solved, 25yrs after the crime. It was narrated bi her, in the past tense. And there was present tense, the investigation and stuff, and flashbacks. And the movie ended with her saying, "I would be 42 if I was alive now, I would be married and have children of my own. Imagine that...." It really tugged at my heart strings. I almost cried, and i neva cry in movies. I suggest everyone watch it. It's called "Murder in Greenwich" You can borrow it from me if you want. Click on the link and you can find out more about Martha. I'm still sad about it. Why does murder happen? It's so - unjust. And horrible. It's hard to imagine how one split second action can change our lives forever...

       Today i finally stopped procrastinating, and i finished mi mountains of french translation h/w, maths h/w (rationalising the denominatior on binomial surds - ugh!) and i FINALLY forced miself to do the dreaded English review on the Yr 11 PLay (write a review on the play focusing on how the play's structure reflects its context and ideas) and I cleaned mi room, and did flyers 2 4 mi Health assignment. It was a massive work day. But I'm proud. Now I've finished. And I can go back to happily procrastinating in peace until once again the workload piles up too high, and I hav to do it!

       Evangelism....hmmm, that's what I've been thinking about today. I was reading through the Bible Study stuff that Helen gave me and this word came up. And I thought, hey, maybe that can be my big word? Because, ok well I haven't really told ne1 this ('cept Mel) but I'll just say it anyway, I kinda have been feeling latley that God has been sending me to talk to people who don't believe in him, and tell them about Him, and Jesus and the Bible. Even people I don't like.   Like this girl called Jordan from Hamilton Island. I didn't really know her very well, but I didn't really like her much, but we got into conversation about God at mi Aunty Joey's wedding. And I was kinda scared of talking to this person, who I didn't even know, about God and I didn't know how she'd react, and I was scared because I didn't know what to say, but I felt God was telling me that I had to talk 2 her, so I did, and he gave me the words to say. After I got back from the island, i was led to speak to my good friend Danielle, who was very confused about Christianity, i explained it to her and about Jesus and what his death meant for us and everything. Feeling overwhelmed I set off to camp, where I was once again put into a situation where these things came up. I had a 3-hour canoe trip with someone who i didn't know on a personal level very well. Caitlin and I had a very in-depth conversation about religion. She used 2 be a Christian but had stopped because it was forced on her when she was little. Once again, I felt like it wasn't me talking, but God through me, if that makes sense? All these things came out of me that I had never even thought of myself, and i actually got through to her, when no-one else could. It was amazing. Exhilirating. And just the other week, I was was talking to my friend Jess as well. So many people has this come up with and it was like it wasn't me talking. I don't feel important enough for God to use me for anything, but yeh, I don't know how else to explain it, it felt like He was. So that's why I'm thinking maybe I'm on my way to evangalism and my own big word. That's why its so important to me to learn how to read the Bible and understand it, so I can inform other people about it.  So, yeh, well that was my little evangelism story, and I don't know why I even have the guts to blog this because it is kinda personal, but yeh, i just felt the need. I just pray that God can help me with this, and with reading the Bible, and that he will keep on sending people 4 me to talk 2, because I love making a difference and doing his work! :D

       Small group was a great adventure 2nite. Because no1 'cept Mel, Rach H, Rach L, Helen and I were there(because every1 was either at the epn or at roseville skool play) We decided to go to Rach H's place 4 small group instead because she couldn't get 2 Helens, so we set off for the big adventure to Duffy's Forest. Her house is way cool bi the way. The car trip was interesting. The presence of Mel always helps. We picked Rach up and Helen and Mel had a fight with the horn, which ended with Helen twisting Mel's arm, but with Mel getting many-a long honk in. :D We stopped at the service station 2 stack up on goodies, and on the way back Helen and Rach locked us out of the car and started 2 drive off, so we sat on the bonnet and the boot. hehe, that made them open up. It was quite funni.  Rach L felt compelled to stare at me in the most scary way imaginable. A face that is now gonna haunt mi dreams! Thanks Rach!! When we arrived at Rach H's, Rach L was very scared of the dogs and I had to comfort her the whole way there, and back to the car. She thought they were gonna maul her. Hehehe...  The small group discussion got a bit off the topic most of the time, but it was still God-related. Mel brought up the controversial issue of why God allowed pain and suffering in this world and she was angry at him for not giving people a choice to be created and put on earth. We had a lot of discussion on it. We shared things together, such as Helen's journey to God, the room provoked all this. It was quite a reveal-all-your-deep-and-meaningful-secrets room. It was totally cool.   Everyone got a big word to describe themselves (made by Helen - the queen of big words), such as and intermissor (or could it be interceptor?),i actually can't remember, The intermissor word was Helen and Mel, and the other big word which started with R was Rach. Man, I'm not going very well, but just trust me that they were big words! But I didn't get one. That's because Helen said that I was still on my journey and I would have one in time. Yay. And what we talked bout on Saturday night was mi word but it wasn't actually a word, if u get me. You probably don't. Oh well. The night was totally fun.  We had to stop off at the Church on the way home so Helen could get me some Bible study notes, and Rach really had to pee, as she kept on reminding us. Mel and I had a quick dash into the Church (while Rach and Helen were in the Church Centre, peeing and retreiving things) and said a quick "hello", "what're doing here?", and "bi!", to T1 and Monty.   Overall small group was really good (not that it eva isn't :P) It was good because I was really in the mood for small group. It's just like one of those days where you feel like sitting down with friends, in the warmth of a fire and talking about God, y'know? Small group tonight kinda helped me to re-affirm how lucky I am. I mean, I haven't had an abused or hard childhood, I have a great family, lots of luxuries if I think about it, I have GREAT friends (i luv ya guys!) and I have God, the best of all! So now I can put things into perspective. I mean, sure, I'm not gonna get everything I want. But at least now I can be happy with what I have. Thanks God.

       Has any1 eva noticed just how  many doubles  there are at church? I mean seriously, it's just not normal! This is a list of doubles, that Mel and I devised while in a boring Art History lesson! We racked our brains and this is all the ones we found, and it is seriously a lot! But if u go to St.Steves and are a double that we have not got on our list - the comment here and we'll add u!   Church Doubles  --> Pip x3 --> Gemma x2 --> Tim x2 --> Pete x2 --> Ashleigh x2 --> Rach x2 --> Steph x2 --> Jamie x2 --> Andrew x2 --> Dave x2 --> Bec x2 --> Steve x2  see, how many is that?

       Well, today was very interesting. And 4 once this was because of classes. 3 to be exact - Science, Art and PD. Ahhhhh...the joys of a random class...   Science:   1st period, the day started us off with Science. Annie decided 2 not be here and be sick, so she left mel and I up to our own devices! Muhahahaa....... Mel felt like being random and vague, and suggested that she would hate if something she invented was named after her - she decided to tell me the non-existent example of "John Camera" heheehee, so Mel. Mel also wanted to know what her "scientific" name was, so here it is: Melanofades, the interesting creature that no-one can tame. We were attempting to finish all these sheets we had 2 do, and Mel was in a random I'm-gonna-write-everything-in-full-sentences-mood, which is realli strange 4 her! So me, being in the hypo mood I was, attacked her so she wouldn't finish the sentence she was writing, Mel then tried to escape and we ended up screaming and chasing each other around the Science lab, while she was still trying to finish the sentence! Where was the teacher? U may ask. Our teacher is sooooooo cool, she is totally used 2 us mucking up so she just kept on going on with the usual buisness of teaching the class while we ran around like lunatics. She's the coolest, u can get away with anything in that class!   PD:   Well good old Mrs. Irwin. She always makes PD, well how can I put it?  Interesting...  She decided she would like to tell us the details of her menstrual cycle when she was 23 and how the travel affected it, it was quite traumatic! (she's about 65 now!) Visual detail we don't need. And she always likes to mention how great sex is - and i quote - "it's quite exciting actually", "im not saying you shouldn't have sex, i mean just wait, because it is soooo wonderful when you finally do it" and many other equally scary things coming out of her old granny mouth. Quite hilarious actually, of course, only in hindsight, after you hav got over the shock!   Art:   Art, with Criddy. What more can I say. She makes the class intersting each time. Imagine an old, scary, "voluptuous" as Han would say, lady who has 2 sons called Bead and Darcy! I mean, shes truly a physco. Once again, Han and I decided to do the physco dance that we did last lesson and ended with her banging her hand down on the table and screaming because we were doing this while she was trying to talk bout the conceptual framwork  (boring!)  So anywayz, we were doing the physco dance again, and she turns around, and says in this really high-pitched voice, "Turn It Off" (refferring to the radio - which she has sum major thing against) and Han and I once again burst into fits of laughter. Haha, Criddy u make our day :P

       Well, today, what can I say it was an  interesting  day! Firstly, we had the performing arts tryouts, and, well, it didn't go too well. The school has some kinda unspoken rule that no-one is allowed to show their midriffs,  ever . Our tops actually didn't, but while I was doing mi round-off, shock!, horror!, surprise! Mi shirt went up 2 inches, now they want us to wear a black leotard under the top. Man they are picky. And after we finished the dance, Mrs. Wilson is like "Well, it's not really very polished!" " HELLO! ", I said to her, "We had  4 DAYS  to make it!!" But of course she told me in response, that "It's easy to make up a dance in 4 days!" Hmph, has she eva tried?! I don't  think  so! And Mrs. Gray, who has been in a pissy mood eva since did a  REALLY  bad dye job on her hair, said we did too many things on the floor. Like they could do better. They hated it, but we got in anyway.  On a happier note. English was actually fun. Our class loves to debate things, impromptue and in our desks of course, not in a formal setting. Seeing as the class is filled with "intellectuals" (because we're English 1) as Han would call them, these debates often last ages and are never resolved. We are studying Romeo and Juliet, and Ms. Everingham felt compelled 2 ask a very controversial question (that she should have known all too well would result in this) of "Who's fault was it that Romeo and Juliet died?" We started off saying, well it was no-ones fault, you could go back to the start of time or wateva, and then we got into the question of whether they were actually in love, and then whether we believe in love at first sight. Which resulted in Kiera and i having a very heated 1 on 1 debate. Me, being the romantic that I am, was on love's side, and Kiera, being the "cold-hearted witch" as we called her (dw, all in joking context) was on the opposite. We ended up giving each other evil eyes, while Kiera said things to me such as - "One day you're gonna meet some hobo on the street and get married 2 him in one of those Las Vegas wedding chapels" and my retort was that she was "Going to end up as an old loveless lady, and all she had were her cats!" It was a very funni argument actually, one that progressed after the class had finished arguing and that Ms. Everingham had a lot of trouble breaking up. Seriously, don't try and fight with Kiera, espescially not on such a huge topic!  Although, i must admit, it  was  fun :P And it helped me to confirm my feelings...   Blogging off

       Wow, I'm in Civics History right now (one of the worst possible subjects - 'cept we are in the computer rooms because we have an assignment and mi group and i have finished, so right now I like this subject because it's bludgy :D), and its last period! I can't wait 2 leave school, its been a long boring day.   At lunchtime Hannah and I practiced our dance 4 Middle School Performing Arts because our tryouts are on tomorrow. It's good, it still needs a bit more polishing of course, but I think it's good enough that they'll let us in. But the thing that is annoying is that there are these other people who are also doing a dance, Sian and Kelly, and they are really good dancers, like National Champs and stuff, and I'm just sick of everyone saying, "Hey, how good is Sian and Kelly's dance?" Like right in front of mi face, and I'm like, well,  thanks!  Sure, it's good, I can't deny it, and I'm not really jealous, I'm just sick of everyone going on and on about how good it is and kind of shunning us. That's the worst part about dancing against Sian and Kelly. Ahhh, meh  Mel's coming over this arvo. She usually comes over every Tuesday, 'cept she hasn't much latley, so we are finally reigniting the tradition of "Potato Day" Yay. I think we're gonna do a post together this arvo, so yeh.   Looking forward to this arvo, and night, because it's "Pizza Night", which is basically where mi Mum and I have a girls night, and stay home and make gourmet pizzas and watch America's Next Top Model, where we imitate their voices, in sterotypically nasal sounding American accents. Its fun. Meanwhile, mi bros are out at Homebush at cycling training, because they're like National champ freaks, both of them, so they train all the time, and yeh. I like to get them out of the house. Peac, quiet and girly times work 4 me.

       Well today was a pretty fun day, well let's exclude the night's activities for now. It started with Mel waking me up to go to her place to paint her room yellow. Now that was fun. When we were washing the walls, Mel grabbed a soapy sponge and smooshed it right in my face, so I smooshed her back, and we ended up having a screaming, sponge-dodging fight. Mel also found it very amusing to paint my legs white, which I just spent 1/2 scrubbing off in the shower. She was also very amused to find me caught in the "owie spot" on more than one painful occasion. When we were cleaning out the brushes we had yet another fight, this time with the hoses, in which Hannah S arrived just in time to catch the last of it. Hannah arrived when we were having our break, and we ate pies and talked together. During which Mel hinted in the most un-subtle way I've ever heard, that Hannah and Pete Hayes should go out. The converstaion went something like this: Mel:  "So when's Pete gonna teach you the drums?"  Hannah:  "Ahhh, it probably won't happen.."  Mel:  "You guys should make a day of it, Pete could teach you the drums, then you could go to the movies together...  (winking from Mel, nervous chuckling from Hannah and hysterical laughter from me :P)  hehehe.  I had to leave at 2:30pm so I didn't get to put the actualy yellow colour on the walls. Mum wanted me to come see Harry Potter with the family. Yes, now I am posting this info in my blog under full awareness that I am probably going to be slaughtered by all the people whom which I have ridiculed and laughed at, while they have defended themselves, about going to see Harry Potter. T2 in particular. :P But neway, the movie was well..... what can i say about the movie? I had heard so many mixed reviews about it that it is probably impossible, under the circumstances, to present a true critique of it. But must I say, the change of director was obvious. The sets were different, but I think I was the only one who noticed. And I found the very unsubtle changes of season pretty corny. And, mi gosh, there is too much sexual tension between 13 yr olds, i mean come on! Apart from that nothing really stood out for me. I would say it was a pretty lukewarm movie. I wouldn't see it again.  But after this was when the torture really began. Mum decided it would be nice to go out for dinner. We ended up going to the eat-in Pizza hut at Warriewood. I can tell you I'm not going to be doing that again with my family any time soon! Firstly, we have to wait in a 15-minute line to get seated, and when we actually do, there is, surprise surprise, a party of little kids running around like lunatics. And my littlest brother, Michael, was being the biggest pain. We had to sit in one of those booth chairs, and of course, I was on the end, so I hardly got to stay in my seat the whole time, i was constantly getting up to let people in and out. They had no pizzas that i liked, they seemed to only want to cook the yuck ones. And my bros were just getitng on my nerves like you wouldn't believe! Only a person with two younger brothers could understand the struggle I was going through not to hurt them. And then, after we had finally left the damn restaurant, we drove home, with Michael once again trying to hurt Callum, and wailing in a high-pitched voice when mum got angry at him. Mum decided to play "Eye Spy" which was  the worst  game she could have possibly chosen for the mood I was in. Michael insisted on starting his turn with "I spy with my big pussy bleeding eye..." aaaahhh, little boys. Let me just tell you I was gald to get home...

       I'm gonna try and fit in another blog b4 it is Monday. Church was cool and funni 2nite. Although I felt sick the whole time, and the fact that Pete Hayes felt compelled to throw a Bible at my head  did not help . I mean just because he's obviously upset about sumthing, doesn't mean he should take it out on another people. I mean, it wasn't very nice. But I'll 4 give him, even tho it hurt, because he looks very depressed. Poor Pete.  Steve gave a very interactive sermon 2nite, which involved us splitting into groups and discussing questions about a passage, but our group (Ashley Baker, Claire, Gemma and I) were pretty shotty and tended to not hear the question! oops - steve had 2 help us a few times.  And Mel and I were "brave" people that Rach L was looking 4 to give an impromptue speech about EBN last nite. So we got up there, and spent a while laughing, till I had 2 start because Mel wouldn't. I embarressed miself by using horrible grammar, "there were foots on the wall" Mi god, at least i corrected miself through the fits of laughter. And I got $2 from Gem, because she dared me to tell everyone that she didn't come and she'd give me money, so i did, i said "lots of people came, but some didn't, like gemma, because she stayed home and was a BLUDGER, so i suggest everyone comes next time!" It fit in well, and now I'm $2 richer. Yay :D  Luke's long john's are keeping me company at home until they arrive at Hannah's on Tuesday all ready for their Speedo Joel transformation. :D hehe. Yay. And one question, Y did Speedo Joel not turn up to church? Grrr him. And T2 didn't come either, I wanted 2 talk 2 him. I told T1 about Thrush Anonymous meetings and how Mel is obsessed with Thrush and he was severley freaked out! Don't blame him...hehe, it was funni tho.  Oh, and Dance was soo cool. We all came and we ALL had blue T-shirts and black pants. It was realli funni. And we thought that Ash would turn up and ruin it all, 'cept she didn't come! :'( We missed Ash. And after we finished dancing we were gonna pray 4 Kwame, and then we decided 2 do a prayer dance. So we split up into 4 groups of 2, and 1 person had to be God and 1 had to be Kwame, and you had 2 express what you wanted to say and pray 4 through your dance. It was so cool. I was with Megan and she was Kwame and I was God. Mel thought it was gonna be hard to do, but once you started dancing, it all just came out and it was so easy. And fun too.  I like Church and Ernie and Dance. It's such a cool part of mi life :D

       I am so happy. :D EBN was soooo fun! They had laser lights, and smoke machines and cafe and air hockey tables, and they used the footprints theme that we came up with in small group. Yay! And Helen and I had a D&M, it was really cool and nice. She gave me a Bible too :D I'm reading Mark right now.  I talked 2 a lot of people, and I finally found out y Ernie is called Ernie from Tom. It's something about Earnest Prayer. Haha, and Luke gave me his long john's to  turn into Speedo Joel merchandise, I'm gonna give them to Hannah W on Tuesday at school. I kinda felt bad last nite because I didn't help pack up, cuz i left at like 11, so they were already packing away, and Pip L and Tim B and KC and I just made more mess bi pushing down chairs and stuff...hehe :P Overall it was a REALLY good night! And damn Gemma 4 missing it, she's gonna be paying 4 it later ;)  hehehe, Beth

         "There's nothing else for me to do but DANCE!.... all these hard times I'm going through, just DANCE! Candy on mi heels tonight, Big Ben. Woooo ooooohh oooohhhh"   I'm in a dancy mood.  My feet, back and every single muscle imaginable aches, but it was worth it.  I danced for 5 and 1/2 hours yesterday, no joke.  But Hannah W and I finally finished our dance for Performing Arts!  We'd been practicing every lunchtime for the whole week, fighting off people to rights to the  only  CD Player in the school, danced all night last night, and perfected the rest today.  It's a combination of hip-hop, jazz and our combined gymnastics abiltity :P I'm really happy with it.  We've also got our costumes downpat. I'm really excited, and really happy with our effort, we deserved this.

       "My friend Casey defeated gravity and flew - for a split second" - quoted by Gem  Here's yet another extract of some-one hilarious blog.  urlLink Casey's  gravity-defying stunt - in her own words...   Everyone had gone to the hall at lunchtime to watch Hannah Sena and Beth dance. So after Julia and I sat in awkward silence for ten minutes we decided to join them. As we got there i saw Beth and Han fiddling with the CD player, and the rest of the group playing Basketball. I decided to join the b-ballers. We were just mucking around for awhile, no real teams, when i saw jacki on the opposite side of the court preparing to pass the ball to Bubs. The quick thinker that i was, i decided to run infront of Bubs and jump for the passing ball. Unfortunately it was more of a dive, a dive that i forgot to land. Instead of landing triumphently on the polished wood (with the ball in my grasped hands), i seemed to be diving horizontally around one and a half metres from the floor. I don't exacly remember how i landed but i remember i was in pain. Not like blood pain, just aching. Everywhere. I quickly pulled down my skirt and looked around. Everyone was either laughing or seeing whether i was OK, how embarrassing. I don't think i even got the ball. I was curled in a heap on the floor, when i heard Ozzy's booming voice "That's it, everyone, OUT!". Well, actually i don't remember that, i was told she said that later. Jess and Gemma pulled me up, i was doing nothing, just trying to pull myself down to the floor. They finally got me up, practically dragging me to the stairs. What was even worse, is that whenever people tried to cheer me up by saying something funny, tears came bursting out of my eyes! I told them to not make me laugh, but i don't think they understood, so as we were walking up the stairs, everyone still trying to make me laugh, i couldn't take it anymore, and ran to the bathrooms. That was my story of how i 'fought the law of gravity', my superman experience, my stupid attempt to be a bird.   Typical.

       Hehe,  urlLink Rach  is so funny. She did like 3 really funny things in the matter of a few days. These events can be best summed up in her words, so here's an extract from her blog:   "I like the authoritarian figures in my life. Like Helen. I blessed her carpet with a bout of fizzy drink not once, but twice on Friday night at small groups. The first time it was just a shaken up bottle of coke. The second displayed my soccer genius, when I kicked the empty coke bottle into Helen's glass of solo. But she was very nice about it, said she had something funny to blog about for the night. So yes, we like her. Tom's nice too. I accidently-on-purpose pulled his chair out from underneath him at Ernie tonight, sending him sprawling. But he laughed. Yay for Helen and Tom not being tightarses!"   hehe, ur funni Rach...

       I am so annoyed at society right now. Does that sound weird, yes, of course it does. Because it is! But seriously, why is society so obsessed with marks? All anyone cares about is exams, marks, results, tests. This is not what it's about. Why does it matter? Even we make big deals about it. My friend Melissa (aka. Bubs) decided that this year she wouldn't tell anyone her exam marks, and you wouldn't believe the crap she got from people who were obsessed with finding out what she got!And my other friend Loz, gets sooo stressed about exams, she is in tears during nearly the whole time, becomes depressed and once I was even scared she was gonna hurt herself. How can people allow this 2 happen? We are only  kids  for God's sake. Stress is known to shorten your life span and cause many other  urlLink detrimental physical effects on the body.  We shouldn't be put in these situations. Like I got my Maths exam back not long ago, and I got 70%, but seeing as I am in the top class, i scored "signifigantly below average" on nearly every section ('cept algebra, algebra rox!) And the teacher had to have a "chat" with me at lunch about my "dissapointing" exam mark. The pressure ended up finally getting to me and I was in tears in English. After I got over being upset, I felt angry. Why is society so exam-driven? It's not right. There are other ways to measure intelligence. Not everyone works well in an exam situation. I'm quite annoyed right now. Why is the pressure to acheive so great? Is this pressure going to have detrimental effects on our future generations? Who is to blame?

       This is an extract from  urlLink Hannah's  blog! Man it's funny!   " Force (pause) Elite (pause) the best in the state, (pause) Red, black, and white (use team colors)(pause) first rate.       Blogging on here, MelissaNSC is our cheerleading coach, as you can see Beth and i weren't expecting her as a coach, we were expecting a blonde bimbo or a nerd with a retainer. Instead we were stuck with Melissa, a vulumptous furious chick who thinks we can't count to 3!  We arrived at the church anxious of her arrival but there she was with her bland navy blue trackpants and a baggy sweat shirt she flicked her dirty black hair and said HIT IT! OMG, no! We didn't no what we were in for.. thats when Beth discovered a picture that looked exactly like her on a website, with the exception of no glasses. Beth and i printed the picture off and in cheerleading placed it beside her CD Player..waiting for an outcome, half way through the class she said:  "Ok Guys jokes over, you've done your research it is me..it is me (pause) Who's Beth, who's beth? (laughter could be heard in the background) Who is Beth? Are you Beth!  It was so funny! More updates on MelissaNSC..next friday!"   Haha, seriously good personal joke times!

       Hey, well, I had the most hectic weekend eva. 4 a start, I went 2 Jess's party, now this was, interetsing, shall I say. Firstly, on the way we were in the car with Ted and we were doing karaoke to...Britney Spears "Oops I Did It Again" Hehe, it was quite hilarious. Once we got to the restaurant, we were seated upstairs in a REALLY big long table, so I only got to see half of mi group that night, but there was this really phsyco guy there who verbally abused us! We were "being too loud" and he turned around and started a string of swear words, which mainly consisted of "fuckin kids...damn...fuck...kids...loud...fuckin hell..." and an array of equally colourful language, that the whole restaurant heard, and the man on the opposte table politley pointed out that "i  think  the man is trying to say your being too loud", and the service was soo bad, the waiters treated us like we weren't even customers, slamming the food down on the table and being generally rude, and the food wasn't that great either, so I'm definatley not coming back there again!  But after dinner (of which mainly consisted 4 me of 1 slice of pizza and a scoop of pasta, I was  starved ) we went back to Gemma's house 4 the sleepova, and we watched Phone Booth, which I've seen about 10 times, but it's still good, and then we watched a Viva-La-Bam marathon, which was really funny! This guy, his name is Bam right, and he got 4 truckloads of xmas lights and put them on his house, and made the whole of the insisde of his house an ice skating rink by putting this special layer of ice down, and then he got fake snow, like HEAPS of fake snow and sprayed it all outside, so it was like it was snowing, and then he got all these trucks and drove around and stuff, he was truly physco. He was a guy who was on Jackass once, so i think that explains it!  The next day,  urlLink Mel  had to leave early 4 Sunday School, but the rest of us hung around and watched Silence of The Lambs, which was my second time I'd seen it, and it definatley wasn't as scary as every1 made it out 2 be, like I love a scary movie, but this 1 was  not!    And then  urlLink Hannah W  and Gem and I went 2 Chatty 2 go shopping. We ended up getting Boost, but we got an extra 1 because of this free deal thingo, and Hannah left it in Valley Girl! And she came back 2 get it later and it was gone!   I wonder where that Boost it now...   And I bought a jumper in Valley Girl and a necklace in Diva. Excellent... But bi this time I was getting really tired, and all the extra energy I gained from sleeping in on Sat. morning left. Mum was late picking us up, so I had to drop off Han and Gem, then rush home, pick up dance pants, and rush off to Church Dance.  Dance was realli fun bi the way, 'cept I felt a bit behind everyone, but obviously I would be because it was mi first week, but I think I've pretty much got the chorus good, 'cept the rest of it I'm a bit rusty. Ahh, well I'll pick it up. It was realli fun tho!! :D And then I went 2 Ernie afta that, so bi this time I am sooooo exhausted, and I met  urlLink Jo  Yay 4 Jo! I was going on in her blog about how she didn't know me and how Church circles aren't welcoming and how I don't know half the people at Church and stuff, so she's like "Hey, I'm Jo, you posted on mi blog, now I know you!!" and yeh...it was cool...Jo's nice (hey Jo if ur reading!)  But neway, Church was cool, but I felt real bad, because I was practically falling asleep during Phil's (i think it was Phil, i dunno i was half-asleep) sermon. And i was sitting with mi knees 2 mi chest, resting mi head on 1 knee, and then Gem got her scarf and rolled it up and put it on mi knee 4 mi head 2 lie on and I'm like "Nooooo.....I must stay awake, if u do that I'm gonna fall asleep!" I think I ended up staying awake the whole time...but I sooooo didn't absorb  any  of it! Ahhh...meh  Neway, I had a pretty big weekend, and I pretty much passed out wen I got home, after I struggled through the rest of mi Maths h/w and attempted to clean mi "pigsty of a room" as mi Mum so nicley put it.

       Yay! Weekend - FINALLY! This week has felt like a kind of strange week 4 sum reason that I don't know y, but I'm just glad that it is finally the weekend. For a good start to the weekend, i slept in until 10:30am today!! Man, it was good. I haven't done that 4 ages. It was my attempt to catch up on the weeks, months, years of lost sleep. 2day I have to force myself 2 do schoolwork, which is actually what I should be doing now, but you know, who wants to write about how their major work fits into the four frames, subjetive, cultural, structural and post-modern. Yawn! Can you say boring? But i gotta do it, or Criddy will fail me, ahh, ill get round 2 it eventually. 2nite is Jess's 15th b'day party! Yay. :D We're going 2 Pino's Pizzeria and then after there is a sleepover party at Gem's with Loz, KC, Mel, Gem and I. Yay. Fun. We're gonna stay there 4 the day on Sunday, and I think we're going 2 Chatty to get Boost but I'm not sure, meh, we'll figure something out. Then I leave 4 Church dance, then Ernie, then Church, then home again, then SCHOOL! ahhh...crap I've got a French exam, I almost 4got bout that. And through ALL of this we've gotta make up a dance 4 Middle School Performing Arts Evening...ahhh, i hope we get 2 make it in time, because i really wanna be in it this yr! Oh well, hope y'all (hehe i luv that word) hav a great weekend too!

        Hey don't you just love this poem? It's mi fave in the world! I'm getting it framed and put on mi wall in mi room soon!  It's a beautiful picture of God's relationship and love 4 us..   One night a man had a dream, He dreamt that he was walking along the beach with God. Across the sky flashed scenes of his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand. One belonging to him, the other to the Lord.  When the last scenes of his life flashed before him, He looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that at many times in his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that this happened at the very lowest points in his life. This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it  "Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed at the most troublsome points in my life, There is only one set of footprints. I don't understand that when I needed you most you would leave me"  The Lord replied, "My son, my precious child, I love you and I would never leave you. During the times of trial and suffering, When you only see one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you"

       Mi life is pretty blah right at the moment, you know im all confused bout everything, espescially relationships, not just with guys, although they are part of it, but with parents and friends as well. Maybe, i think, if I'm so confused about relationships and mi feelings and everything, then maybe I'm not ready to have a relationship. I feel ready, but maybe God's trying to tell me in a way i'm not. My Mum seems to be holding onto me tighter right at this moment as well, but strangely enough its the time i most need her to let go. Cuz im growing up now, but I don't know if she can accept that yet, because in her eyes i seem young, but to me im an old soul, and i feel experienced, although in theory im probably not.   I often wonder, the age old question, what is the meaning of all this. Life, in general. Like sumtimes it just seems like a roundabout, sumtimes it seems like a joy, pure unadulterated joy, and you feel like your flying, riding on the wings of life, but sumtimes, more often than not, it is sad, so incredibly sad that the emotional pain is so bad that you can actually physically feel it. I mean is this what life is all about, is this what God wants for us? To experience so many contrasting emotions, then die and join him? I often wonder...

       I just got back from small group. Fun Fun. We did bible study on Titus, and pretty much stuffed our faces with food. Although we were a bit distracted, due to our tired state! But I joined dance, yay - cool. I like dance, Hannah W, Mel, Jacki, Julia and I decided to make a dance for the Middle School Performng Arts Evening this year seeing as it is our last year in the middle school! And we r also trying to get on the committe, which basically means we get to be the audition judges and bludge class 4 ages! Yay. but the main reason I wrote was 2 say, that now half the small group know a secret about me now. Sitting in a warm comfy room must kind of stimulate these kind of confessions and relisations by other people. And it must bring on the fights as well.   Mel and I had a fight (but dw its all resolved now, im used 2 fighting with mel neway we do it all the time but usually ova stupid little things  - hey mel i hope u don't mind me writing all this, please don't get angry, i mean well) about, well this is silly, it was about Luke (hey Luke if ur reading!) Mel was looking through mi phone and she found like the hundred millon messages in there that Luke has sent me, but i had deleted most of them, but not the most recent ones, like the last 2 weeks or so so there were bout 12 or sumthing in there (yes Luke u really DO send me that many messages!) but they all happened to hav a bit in there bout Mel, so she was annoyed that I was talking to Luke about her "all the time", but it actually wasn't i told her, (those messages were very incriminating) just lately because i needed someone to talk 2 and there was no-one really who wanted 2 listen cept luke (thanks luke!) cuz i usally talk 2 mel because she is mi best friend and all, but we were havin problems so i just needed advice but she was a a bit pissed about me telling him this stuff. Ahhhh, well, its all resolved but yeh. Fun night overall. Who's coming to Ernie's Big Night next week? Blogging off, Beth  Ok, im just looking at mi Mini Magnum stick and it says "Feeling Dizzy" Random, these sticks r random. They use sex 2 advertise wayyyyy 2 much i say, not that the aforementioned comment had nething much 2 do with sex, but meh, it triggered mi random train of thought. Bloggin off 4 REAL this time, Beth

Ok, so mel and I decided to go to Chatswood to buy Jess's present for her b'day party on Saturday, and we decided to buy her a ring that had an engraving in it that said "Happy 15th, Luv Mel and Beth" So we went into Prouds jewellers and we had to wait about 10 mins to get help from this lady, and she came over and she snapped "YES?" at us, and we asked to try on some of their rings, and shes like  "(sigh) Ok....." so we tryed on the ring, and we didnt like it so we were asking to try on other rings and shes getting more and more pissed at us, and we finally find one we like, and we were discussing whether we were gonna get it, because it was a bit expensive, and she starts tapping incessantly on the desk and looking at her watch, so we decide to get it and she totally shuns us, pushing the ring into our hands so we will get out, and giving us dirty looks the whole time we're in there!   I hate it how you go into a store and the security gaurds stand there giving you seedy looks the whole time your in there until you leave, just because your a teenager. One time Mel and Gemma and KC and I went into this party store and we were looking around and the lady gave us seedy looks and turned the securtiy camera on just because we were in there! Ahh, i hate people like that! But the engraving guy was nice, he gave us a discount so the cost would be easy to split between us. Don't you love spontaneously nice people. Thanks for that God. But the only good thing was that we tried the new blueberry Boost, and it was soooo good!  I had one of the most traumatising days of mi life today! We actually had to see a baby being born, and it was sooooo GRAPHIC! The whole video was so gaphic. It showed a penis ejaculating and inside a vagina and penis during orgasm n stuff - im like "i SOOOOO do not need 2 see this!" And we actually saw the baby being SQUEEZED out! Ahhh, it was foul! And we had these seminar speaker people, and they were all like assuming we had already had sex, and im like "HELLO! We are 14 years old! And we are a CHRISTIAN school, and the majority of our year, including me, don't believe in sex b4 marriage!" Mayb they r just used to public skools. And she taught us how to use the pill and everything, we even put condoms on the bananas. I'm set 4 life now! ;) And she also said "Now when you go to parties and binge drink, and take drugs, you can lose control of your body and have sex" NO-ONE goes to these parties! Ahhh, come on. I still feel sick from that video. I mean, I'm usually good with these kinds of things, but honestly, this is too much...

       Hey, right now I'm in the school library, its freezing cold and I am supposed to be doing work! Science assignment to be exact, but u know I got a bit distracted by the wonderful world of blogging...i feel very proud to be mentioned on tom's site (thankyou tom :P) and an outsider blogged on our speedo joel website! yay. Haha  You know the scary thing is that the school is probably reading every single word that i write right now. You know they have this freaky thing where whenever you log into your account, a little window comes up and they can watch everything you do, everything you write even, they'd probably know what a big bludger i am too, a minimised website and word documnet on Pompeii, and a million other blog websites being opened and closed, while the actual work part of mi visit to the library is being very sadly neglected. I wouldnt be surprised if they came and told me to get off the computer right now, i mean, they do that often, they see you playing a game and, ooops, before u know it, you're being hastily shuffled out of the library, because they don't want their perfect view of the hard-working Rosevilian girl to be ruined. I mean our motto is actually "Work Conquers All" (Labor Omnia Vincit as it says on our blazer) I mean how sad is that, I personally would have put it as Amor Omnia Vincit, Love Conquers All but u know, meh. Today we have a PD (Personal Development) Day. How fun. Its bludgy tho. We get to miss the 1st 4 periods, to sit around and play with little babies in Hinemoa, but I've heard we have to watch a baby being born and that it is very graphic, not looking forward 2 that, it was bad enuf in Yr 6 in Interrelate, I neva thought they'd make us endure it again! Oh well, I'll keep u posted (excuse the pun :P) Beth

       hey, go here to read this realli sweet and sad poem -  urlLink Just For This Day Poem  - I found it on Luke's blog (hah - don't mind if i steal the link, thanks luke :P :D)  Newayz, I got mi letter from mi Aunty Cathy the other day, and I am in the middle of replying to her, and it is taking AGES! I just realised how much i had 2 tell her - i actually had 2 write a list of all the things i needed to say so i wouldn't 4get! It's going on 20 pages now, this is gettin ridiculous (haha)...she'll neva reply, she takes ages wen its a 2 page letter...ahh meh, the worst part is how if i want to tell her one thing, then I have to actually explain a whole other thing, like for eg. if i wanted to tell her how it was so funny that last wk at church Joel told me he actually wanted to BUY a Speedo Joel T-shirt, the I'd have to explain the whole story of Speedo Joel!  And I've also been complaining bout mi lack of luv life, and the complications of others! I spend half mi time worrying about other peoples luv problems and how I would solve them, and the other half worrying bout the lack of mine! U know, I'm just thinking now, that I luv the movie 'Love Actually', and that you're sposed 2 feel all good at the end, but i kinda feel sad, and kinda sad 4 miself, even tho that may sound weird, i can't help it. Like I'd like to have a bf, but i 'spose i just hav to trust god with it all, even tho it is hard, like wateva he has planned 4 me i just hav to try mi hardest 2 accept, i mean, if he wants me 2 hav heartbreak then no luv 4 ages, then mayb thats wats sposed 2 happen 4 sum reason, i mean i realli hav no idea, mel and hannah and i were praying outside at helens house about helping all of us just to accept what god has in plan 4 us and to always put him first, but u know, its hard sometimes....pray 4 me peoples  Beth

       OK, I 'spose this is reverse advertising, but our dance was kinda looking mank. Most probably becuase we hadn't practiced in 3 WEEKS!! Come on, holidays are times 4 bludgin and we did exactly that! And now we r paying 4 it! So our dance was mank. It's gotten a bit betta tho. Which is good. Because we sent out invites 2 heaps of church people (skool peeps r already coming) so everyone must come! dw, we'll get it better. All "nice and professional looking" as Gemma said. It's a journey...and we're on our way. Come 2 MSPA!! Ooo...that rhymes!! hehe Bloggin off, Beth  Ooo yah heard, i'm bustin' ass my word!

       I had small group social 2day. Fun fun. But I had to once again get up early to go. It was worth it tho. We went to Pancakes on the Rocks for brunch, most of us succumbed to temptation and had the 'Devils Delight' chocolate pancakes. mmmm.... Helen took lots of photos of our mangled pancakes at the end. Nat and I ate the least, and Anika was a bottomless pit and devoured hers and Ash's meal. We went to the Rocks markets after, that was fun as well. Helen bought a really pretty bracelet for her sisters b'day. I bought Mango Fudge and those hard Rock candy things. Jess bought these luxury strawberries. They are the biggest things u'll eva see and are coated in chocolate and various other yummies. Mmm...Jess bought home a catalogue so she could hint to her Dad 2 buy them 4 her Mum 4 Valentine's Day so she could eat them. She suggested I hint as well. I laughed. Mmm...those strawberries really did look good. We didn't get much time at the markets though because we had 2 catch our bus home. Anika knew her way around the city like a local, so we had no chance of getting lost. But by the time I got home I had a throbbing headache so I collapsed on my bed and slept for 2 hours.  Mmm...feels good now tho. :D Hannah's coming over soon because we have a lot of work 2 do on our dance 4 MSPA. Everyone must come and see us dance! Yay! :) Blogging off, Beth

       Hanni's views on computers: "it really irks me that not only does the computer know more about my dating prospects than I do, but now it's subversively mocking me. I think this is definitely a sign that computers are making serious advances in their conspiracy to take over the world. They're striking us at our collective Achilles heal: the never-ending quest for love. For arguments sake, we'll say that 'love' encompasses 'booty,' too. It's all a trap to make me increasingly dependent on the computer as a social outlet, as a means of friendly validation. They prey on our vulnerability, building their collective mindpower while we unwittingly fortify their cause."

       "Watch out   boys  ...we're coming!" 2day we had our first lesson of Hip-Hop.   Darrio   could not come because unfortunatley he was "stuck in NY" So we had 2   ex-Rosevillian   girls teaching us. They started us off by teaching us   "The Sexy Chair Dance"   Now this was funny.  A classic . We started by taking 4 sexy steps to the chair, then swinging our leg over, and rubbing our hand up and down it, we turned around and did 8 counts of hip swaying, we then walked around the chair, and sat down and crossed our legs, all with   "sexy" faces  . Then we did 4 leg open/twist things, spread our legs, and rubbed our hands down one leg at a time. Then we got up again, walked around the chair, flipped it around and straddled it, then spun our leg over the chair to sit sideways, then flung our back over the chair, flicking our legs up and down. Then we walked around the chair again, and stood on top of it and did a   "sexy pose".   Then we did 4 flicks of the arms, then a bit of a   Marilyn Monroe   pose, then 2 shimmys, and we did this weird pumping the air thing on both sides. We jumped up and opened our legs while in the air, and landed back on the chair, straddling it. Then we alternated our feet movements, swung our leg over the chair once again and did a   "sexy finishing pose".   Haha. It was so classic! Just try and imagine all that with about 50 people doing it, all at varying lengths of ability might I say. Haha. We then had 2 perform it in groups, and the    Resus    people arrived only about a minute after we finished performing. Haha. Poor them they missed out on us. Mrs. B even joined in in all this chair dancing! And the girls teaching us found it funny that they were teaching us the sexy chair dance at an all-girls Anglican school. And they also said we&nbsp;should perform it 2 our "some-one special" much 2 Hannah's delight. Haha. The only person who objected was   Katherine Montano  . Everyone else was having loads of fun. She sat with her arms crossed and said she wouldn't do it because it wasn't   "proper dancing"   and was   "innapropriate".   Haha. Come on just because we were dancing 2   stripper music   while   straddling    chairs     !   Haha. Naa, all in the name of fun.   So, the moral of this story is:   "Watch out boys! Us sexy chair dancers r coming 2 get ya!"     *Mwah*

       I just got a nice phone call from my Aunty Cathy. She recieved my extreamley long letter and is going 2 sit down with a cup of coffee next to the fire and spend the whole weekend reading it. Hehe. I said "I love you too" when I got off the phone and Callum thought I was talking to my boyfriend. When I asked him who my boyfriend was, he thought Monty! Just because he's come 2 my house a couple of times. Hahaha. Sorry but&nbsp;I find that hilarious. Younger brothers are funny things sometimes.

       I had mi detention 2day. I'm a naughty naughty girl. haha It was very productive. We sat in silence 4 half an hour I feel so disciplined I'll never do wrong again! It totally changed me! Haha. As if I can see why people are serial offenders. Then I had a painfully boring Christian Studies lesson Jess dared 2 ask why the Old Testament was relevant when Mrs. Smart said the important part of the bible is Jesus' death and ressurection and all we've done is Old Testament boring stuff. Gosh Mrs. Smart's a bore. She puts me 2 sleep. Huge is stupid;with her annoying maps of Australia and feeble attempts to act out the word volcanoe and communicate with the Bunka Japanese girls.  And&nbsp;Loz and Julia defended her. Sad, sad people I have mi job interview tomoz. :D

       Why does he hate me so? Why? Why is it so hard? Why does she not know that I need her here now? Why do I hav 2 go through this? Lord its not fair... Why give great happiness, then make things change? Why make me make the little things big? Why let my mind do this? The happiness can be good, but the pain is so masking. Why are the tough times so tough? Please make them easier. I can turn the happiness on and off, well no not really. I can choose who I want 2 show. Maybe I subconciously want the person 2 find out. But the depressivness is never really turned off, just masked. Only people who really know me can tell the difference. Is the happiness there or is it a masked game. Gosh, I just really need you here with me right now....

       Just got back from a "family get together". Aunty Lee Lee, Tony, Aunty Joey, Steve, Elle, Kelsea, Virginia, Nanny, Pa, Mum and I. I wondered how long it would take them 2 find out about Luke. See my family is very interested in my love life (sad really - espescially mi Uncle Warren) A barrage of questions ensued.&nbsp; We started 2 drift onto another topic, until Mum goes "Hey! We're interrogating my daughter here!" And it continued. Haha. I think they wanna meet you Luke. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Hahahahaha. Hilarity.

       All I can say is that Tim and Ash's party was great! Of course, being the boring people that they are, the guys didn't get dressed up! But the girls did! Yay! Bec went FULL-ON and spent about 3 hrs curling her hair. It was sooo cool. She looked JUST like Bad Sandy. I wasn't really trying 2 be anyone, but when I arrived Ash went "Ahhh, Beth's Bad Sandy! Cool!" So I suppose that's what I was :D hehe. B4 I left 4 the party I asked mi Dad and younger brother Michael what era I was from. Dad replied "The 90's" and Michael replied "Texas" Hehe. Silly silly people. And 4 some strange reason, Mum thought TIM HUGHES was coming to the party!! She only just found out who he was the other day and she seems 2 think he is part of the group, no matter what I tell her!! Haha. So neway...the party was really fun! Ash really loved our pressie which was great! I spent a lot of the time with Rach sitting on the couch being lazy and watching people play the iToy thing or wateva it is, where u try and hit things on the screen by waving ur arms in the air. Quite amusing actually. It was warm in there. And everyone wanted us 2 come out, ditch the boys, and hang with the girls. We eventually succumbed 2 temptation.&nbsp;I felt like being more social. So I forced miself into the cold, where we sat around in the garage talking with a bunch o people. Monty was showing his more "feminine" side by wearing Nat's pink satin dressing gown and prancing around like a girl. Luke ended up sitting on his lap, and Ash on mine. I once again discovered Monty's "wandering hand" slowly moving from mi shoulder down, and the same 4 Ash. Gosh that guy is cheeky. He was even trying 2 rub my leg at one time. And rub my head.&nbsp;Haha. He eventually stopped. A slap or so from me and a few evil glares from Luke did the trick. hehe. So apart from all those shenanigans the party was quite fun. Some funny conversation with some funny people. The hints from various people who will not be named 2 go and "sit on Luke's lap!!" were laughed off, as per usual.&nbsp;(come on as if I would do that in front of everyone! :P) I was reluctant 2 leave once the party was over, because I was having heaps o fun, but at least I had Ash's after-party 2 look forward 2!! Yay! Monty tried 2 sneak in the car. He wanted 2 join in the "girls pamper night" Girls only. But we thought he was close enough 2 join us. Hehe.&nbsp; So neway, we were all carpooled back 2 Ash's house. When we got there she showed us her pamper table. It was soo cool! First, we got foot scrub and put it all over our feet, then we took&nbsp;in turns putting our feet into the foot spa. Then we massaged each&nbsp;others feet with mango stuff, then painted the toenails. Next up we had our face masks, mud masks and cucumbers, and we let them dry while we watched 'Grease' and sang along 2 all the songs. Then we did our nails, with hand massages, buffing, polishing, filing and doing French Manicures. And we had massage lines, using various things such as our hands, those little plastic octopus massages and the bead massages. It was a total girls pamper night! Then we had dinner (Tacos) and watched '50 First Dates'. Nat and I were the only ones who hadn't seen it! We just fitted all that in b4 most of the girls had 2 leave. So only the people who were sleeping over were left. Which was Megan, Steph D, Mel, Ash (obviously) and me! We got our mattresses set up and watched 'In America' while eating chokkie and drinking OJ. It was a totally sweet movie! :D That finished at about 2am.&nbsp; Then we talked 4 about 2 hrs!! Hehe. Lots of girly stuff mentioned here, from bitchiness 2 guys. I got a lot of, lets just say "advice" on my love life. Haha. And Mel was embaressing Hayley by saying "Hey, Hayley, y'know, u and Andrew, ay?" And we were all saying that Ash should have kissed Tim because she was "16 and Never been kissed" and also because the knife from the cake was dirty and she had 2 kiss the closest boy, but she wouldn't!! At the party, we were all chanting "Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!" hehe. Didn't work though. Monty was jealous, he wanted the kiss. We evetually settled off around 4am, after Mel was screaming at us 2 shutup numerous times! We had a sum total of 4 and half hours sleep! Argh! We were awoken bi Ash's mum clanging pots and pans, and then becsuse it was Mel's b'day, she was served brekkie in bed, with a pile of pancakes with maple syrup on the top and a scoop of icecream, topped off with a candle and a birthday song! Yay! And I then got driven home. Ash and I consumed the rest of the chocolate in the morning, much 2 Mel's disgust!! SO yeh that was mi fun day and a half. Bloggin off, Beth      Grease is the word.....

       Casey is a hazard. She smashed into the wall the other day in English and broke it. A massive bit fell off, and all these wires came out. You hazard you, Casey. I warn you everyone  stay away! * Mwhahaha* Casey likes to "hide" herself in corners. She curled up at the bottom of one 2day in CS, and Jess and I sat on her. hehe....ur a silly thing Casy. See, there u go you got your mention, u happy now? :P Argh. I hate school. I say we should have one day of school, then another 3 weeks of holidays. Now that would be good. Home and Away is on. It is a sad show. Alf has got dementure or sumthing, he had a vision of a cloud. But as in a pathetic kinda sad. I mean, come on, as if I could be upset that Alf is physcotic.&nbsp; The storylines are outrageous. Who cares? Obviously not me anymore. I bought the Pete Murray album 2day. I love Pete as I have mentioned previous times b4. I am soo gonna see him in concert! Ahh!! Getting excited bout it. Better add it 2 mi 2do list. Organise Pete Murray concert. Mel and I went 2 Chatty this 'arvo 2 get presents&nbsp;4 Tim and Ash's b'day party. After looking 4 stuff 4 Tim, we decided the best thing 2 give a guy is $$$. And so that is what he is gettin. Guys are too hard 2 buy 4! But we got the  perfect  present 4 Ash. It's a combined one. Its so amazingly cute and pretty, and sweet and everything. I love it. Wow. Aren't we great at choosing pressies. :D Hehe. Can't wait&nbsp;4 wkend. I hate school. I miss Small Group. It's tomorrow! A great start 4 the wkend! Yay! Bloggin off, Beth

       Mrs. Boshier is a bitch. She moved me down right to the front of the class 4 the rest of the semester. All because Amber whispered 2 me. How rude. It's like she has permanent PMS or sumthing.  I had mi first guitar lesson 2day after I taught myself it 4 2weeks. The teacher really liked me. Hs name is Andy. He's cool. Quite funny. He loved mi hands (long guitar/piano fingers, y'see?) and he gave me his guitar 2 use and bring home and practice with so I wouldn't have 2 use "Ivan" - mi younger brother's 3/4 size guitar. He was very impressed with how much I knew. :D  Coles Myer say they "would like to congratulate you (me) in advancing further in the recruitment process!"  Oh yay.&nbsp;I am quite desperate. I really need some cash. Trying&nbsp;2 survive on $10 p/w sure is hard!&nbsp;Well I s'pose any job&nbsp;is better than Maccas's or sum other digusting fast-food place. Only if I get a job, balancing the million other commitments I have in my life will just become harder. Gosh, don't you just wish there was more time?

       Lord please help me to not judge people. I try so hard not 2 do it but sumtimes I can't help myelf. Like I'll think, "Oh, that person's not a Christian, because they don't act like it" And it's wrong. And I know it's wrong. And I shouldn't think that either. Please help me not to. And help me not to judge myself on others actions. Tom's sermon the other week was amazing, and it really hit me, because this is exactly what I have been thinking about, and sometimes have been doing. That, "maybe I'm not holy enough or a good enough Christian, because I don't know much about the Bible". And I'm trying to evangelise, and I hear all these stories about people who have preached to over 3 million people in over&nbsp;50 countries, and althought it is great, it is also kind of disheartening.&nbsp;I have just finished reading Acts, and although the stories of Paul's evangelising are amazing, it just makes me feel so helpless sometimes. Like, i reach like what 4 people, and Paul sparks the growth of Chrisitanity and converts MILLIONS. I know I can't compete with Paul, but sometimes I just wonder...am i even making a difference?

       Well, mi day started off with a bird smashing into the car window while crossing Roseville Bridge. Ok, maybe I should explain a bit more.... Well, I was quite happy 2 know that IGSSA Gymnastics was  not  on this morning&nbsp;so&nbsp;I got 2 sleep in until 7.30!! Wow, it was great!!&nbsp;So I got a lift in with Casey. And this is where the bird incident occured. Ted was speaking on the phone and the bird hit the windscreen and we all started screaming. Shows that you shouldn't speak on the phone while driving. Poor birdy. It was horrible. :( So I got 2 school, very reluctant 2 be there, but happy 2 see mi friends!!! I had totally missed them!!! Mi group found out about Luke pretty quickly, they started writing funny and silly poems about him that they hand-delivered 2 me in CCH. Let's just say we won't share them. :P Hehe. But the classes totally sucked. It was cold in history. And I felt sick most of the day. It might be because I didn't have much 2 eat. That happens sometimes.&nbsp; I was bored. I'm worrying about assignments. I have 3 already. School is ridiculous. &nbsp;

       The last day of my holidays (*sniff*) was a very fun one I am glad 2 say! The day started with me getting up extreamly early (9.00am!!) 2 go and have breakfast with Luke. That was very nice. :D Me being the weird eater I am could hardly consume anything (no surprise 4 me in the morning!) We saw Bec and Pete H there, which was kinda random. And also sum random Swedish exchange student with a cool accent!! I love accents! :) That Swedish guy has almost become a personal joke at school already. Hmmm...its quite strange how personal jokes are made very quickly at our school! Neway, I'm getting a tad off the topic here!! Moving on, after brekkie, I went home, Dad picked me up which was good becuase I wasn't looking forward 2 a long hike home. Hehe, mi Dad is soo random! Becuase he dropped me at Macca's, he thought I was actually going there 4 brekkie! All I can say is Eeew! and Dad ur a strange one! So i got home, after waiting in the cold for a while and having a random nice converstaion with this random lady on the street about the weather, and Gemma came over when I got home. :D Yay. We put our application in for Coles Myer! So then Monty came and picked us up, and we walked 2 Glenrose, and bought food (we saw Abby Jansen there, gosh her face hasn't changed one bit but she is so much taller! She looks jsut like her sis!) then we headed off to the park. Nat and T2 (Buckley) came shoon after. But then it started 2 pour, so we rushed into the Church. We didn't really have much 2 talk bout, that was kinda strange. Then we ate a bit more and they left, so it was jsut Monty and Gemmie and me. Then T1 (McCloud) came, this is where the fun began!! I think that T1 brings out the dirtiness in Monty, because all out talk turned dirty, from "rim jobs" to "losing&nbsp;the paddle" and "rowing", we said it all baby!! Fun had bi all. The lumberjack Monty Python song came up as well, seeing as Monty was wearing his "lumberjack jacket" as he so affectionatley put it. And much 2 T1's amusement I showed him mi felxibility skills. :P And I did this spontaneously funny impression of Pete Hayes. I was sitting at the drum kit, and I pulled mi jumper hood right over mi head like Pete always does and randomly hit the drums with my head down while&nbsp;saying "Mi name is Pete and I'm a great drum player!" Yes, I know, it was quite mean, but I don't think I ever got over that Bible bashing incident, and the impression sure was funny!!&nbsp;Hehe.&nbsp;I feel slightly guilty. :P Neway, I ended up having 2 go (becuase i was getting mi Hep A needle later! Argh!) so the guys walked me home. When we got 2 mi street, Monty spied the pile of things outside mi neighbors yard, ready 4 council cleanup, after rummaging around in there 4 a while, he jumped out and proudly produced a bunch of golf clubs. He stood there grinning at us, and we realised how much he looked like a hobo! Honestly, he had these black trackpants on, a red checked "lumberjack" shirt, shoes that looked like he'd found them on the side of the road, a pair of golf clubs swung over his shoulder, crazy hair, and the  perfect  hobo grin.&nbsp;Oh the hilarity of it. So basically my day spent bumming at the Church was filled with many, many laughs. Ahh, ya gotta luv those guys!  Bloggin off,  Beth

       Well the day totally got better! After I got over my Back 2 School  Blues...  We had a short  blackout , and that was bad. But once Church starts -all is good! :D Once again, I felt sick in the service,  AND  i had this massive coughing fit, and I had 2 run out of the room, and tears were streaming down mi cheeks from all the coughing. It was horrible. I like couldn't breathe. But the service was totally good, apart from it being  FREEZING!! &nbsp; Kirsten's sermon really related to me, I thought it was  great , well structured, precise, and it got through to me. So s'all good. And the worship team and songs, lead by Luke, might I say nice job!! And wen&nbsp;u sung, totally cool! Like Mel said - "you sounded like a pro!" U've got a lot of talent there :D But y may I ask did Hannah W and Jess not come 2 church? I can understand y Hannah W didn't but Jess..... hmmmm  So neway, I had A   LOT   of good bonding time with my guy friends 2nite. Which was all good. Monty got too close 4 my comfort (and Luke's too  ;)  ) a few times, but all in good humor, ay? Haha. &nbsp;So yeh, totally bonded with a lot o people 2nite, so I was really pleased with that. I'm still really looking forward 2 the party! I'm enjoying asking what everyone is gonna wear!! SO after Church, we went 2  Maccas  which was also fun! I scabbed my lift in with Tom, in his  chick-magnet van , and Jo, Gemma&nbsp; and Monty came along as well. Jo was talking all about how she felt sorry 4 the Maccas staff because we always came there and they knew we were from the Church and we were so rude and made such a mess and everything. Hehe, and Jo and Tom were both sayin how I was talkin bout how I know who Monty likes in mi blog, and how I jsut ramble on and don't even know wat I'm saying. Becuase I couldn't remember saying that! but it's soo true! I do ramble!! hehe, I'm doing it now! *mwhahaha* There were a group of  drunk guys  in Maccas. They made me laugh. I like watching drunk people. They amuse me greatly. :D I'm a strange one. It was Luke and I's 1 week anniversary as Monty so kindly reminded me. I think he just wanted 2 point out that Luke 4got, which he actually didn't, but yeh, meh! In Macca's I had some  good squishy conversation  with friends. We were talking bout practical jokes. Monty said how u buy two drinks of coke. Finish one of them, then cut the bottom of it, put it on the tray, and pour all the coke from the otha one into it, and then move away. When the Maccas staff come 2 clean it up, they pick up the coke cup and coke spills and bursts out  EVERYWHERE!  Hehe. How evil. And Gemma and I were reminiscing on Mr. Channels, Johnny and his biscut, and "personal space". That was fun. And then I moved and had some good  un-squishy conversation  with other friends! Aren't friends great?! I luv mi friends! Scabbed another lift home with Matt Stanton. Gosh Mel can b a funny one. We danced around outside singing  "Heaven...I'm in Heaven!"  to get  warm!    And then I had mi late dinner when I got home. And, this is good because I LOVE 2 be oragnised, I have finally organised wat I'm doing tomorrow! I had like 3 different people wanting 2 do 3 different things with me tomorrow. But I have now managed to do 2 of them, and compromise with the other! How good is that!    &nbsp;  Life is great....  School on Tuesday. But life is great. At least I can see my Rosie friends!! I haven't seen 'em 4 soooo long!! 3 weeks!! Luv ya'll! Blogging off, A&nbsp;slave 2 the blog, Beth

       Went 2 go 2 tha movies 2day 2 see Raising Helen with Mum and Callum. The power broke, and so we didn't get 2 see it. Damn it 2 hell! It is sooo dam windy outside. We drove up to the lookout over Collaroy Beach. The waves were so huge! Then we drove home. I gave up going out with Mel and Gemma 4 that. How utterly disapointing. Church 2nite. I sooo miss it. And I don't know y, I mean i went last week. Weird. I don't wanna go back 2 school. How evil. I'm teaching miself "Wonderworld" by  Oasis  on the guitar. Yay. I really love that song. Listening to it now actually -  "There are many things that I would like 2 say to you, but I dont know how,&nbsp;I said&nbsp;maybe, You're gonna be the one that saves me, and after all, you're my Wonderwall!"  Quite a good song. Mmmmm...  Em, G, D, A7sus4    I really don't wanna go bak 2 school. I love seeing my friends every day. And, crazy thing is, I miss Luke. Yes and I saw him on Tuesday. 5 days. How sad is that. Once I go back 2 school I'm gonna have 2 get used 2 going without him 4 5-6 days   EVERY WEEK!   I'm gonna die. Ahhh...I'm already dead. These have been like the best hols eva, and they are finishing and I totally can't accept it. Just like Mel can't accept that  Summer  is gone and over, and isn't coming back 4 ages!   I'm looking forward 2 Ash and Tim's b'day party .  Should be good !  Grease   dress up theme, then   girly sleepover.   Should be fun!! Eh'xcelent. But the only bad thing is I've gotta get 2 pressies and mi costume in a week!     &nbsp;  Argh...stupid school!   Mi back 2 School   Blues...   Blogging off   Beth

       Yesterday I went 2 sleepova at Mel's house at 'round 6pm. After I had a forced bummy day, I was glad 2 get out!! KC came as well. SO Mel had this wonderful idea that we should go to Pulse at CCC. So we went. And mi god it was sooo bad! First, we came and we got lost! Because this place is sooo massive! We ended up finding Rory and he told us where it was.&nbsp; So we walk downstairs into this room and the first thing I think is, "Mi God it's like a nightclub" And it sure was. It felt like I was in this illegal, underground rave party place. The music was sooo loud, and the sound system was pretty awesome. It was sooo big though. This place is so rich! There was all this modern cool artwork on the walls, and these little red poof chairs, with mini table at knee height with candles on it. There was this bar, and a stage with a DJ on it and surround by the MASSIVE sound system. Then there were pool tables, and a screen with random videos&nbsp;on it, with like bunnys and stuff killing each otha. And the back door was open so people kept on coming in, lots of people. Seriously all this stuff is like nuthing our church could ever afford. Not that I even want it! I totally missed St.Steves, with it's good 'ol green carpet and EBN's simple laser lights. And everyone was soooo dressed up as well. This place didn't have a good vibe 'bout it. We looked 'round 4 people we knew but we couldn't see ne1 so we were totally lonered. We ended up sitting down, wondering wether it would start. But the strange thing was it never did. It was jsut music all the time. It was total boredom torture. I started 2 feel sick so we went out of the room and sat in a hallway talkin. We&nbsp;tried 2 prank Mel's Dad so he would pick us up, but I didn't know my fone was a private number (I've changed it now!) Then we tried 2 prank Luke, and we ended up messaging him 2 tell him 2 call me. He wouldn't come and save us which was a shame. But we talked 4 abit. Mel tried 2 get him 2 come by saying things like&nbsp;- "If you love her, which you do, you will come!" and "There are heaps of hot guys here and they are all coming up to Beth and she is very tempted" It didn't work. He just laughed. haha. So we ended up running into this seminar room and watching TV. How sad of us. And we found lollipops in the kindergarten cupboard and we ate them. How mean of us. We ended up going home around 10. But it was soooooo bad! When we got bak 2 Mel's house we watched home videos (hehe, i saw u as a 1 as a 10-yr old Luke! U look sooo different! Mwhahahah....) and the Castle. I left her house at bout 1pm. We only woke up at 12.00 midday because we didn't get 2 sleep 'till 2am! Argh. So tired. And then&nbsp;Bec Baines&nbsp;came over 4 dinner. We had baked dinner. :D Yum! We had a nice chat in mi room, and we did those little matchmaking quizzes where u add all the letters in ur name and do all this random stuff. Hehe, Luke and I got 97% compatability and Bec and Luke got 17%! Hehe. Jsut 2 give you an example. We did more people obvously. Mwhahaha. So that was basically mi day. How tiring. Im tired. Nitey Nite.

        I'm just reading throught my archives, because I am so incredibly bored, and hehe, mi old blogs r funny. Not that they are really that old seeing as I've only been blogging since May, but I'm reading the blog about where Mel and I had a fight about Luke in front of everyone at small group and found out a "secret" bout me. Hehe, well it's not much of a secret now is it? It's funny, looking back on my blogs, how many things I had to conceal back then. Mmmm..sumthin 2 think 'bout.     &nbsp;   I'm having an incredibly boring day. Mum says I have to stay home becuase I have literally done something everyday since I got back from Canberra. I really should do this stupid Science assignement.&nbsp; But I am the world's biggest procrastinator so I won't! Mwhahaha.     &nbsp;   Y'know, just talking to Mel last night, sometimes I wonder, if guys will ever figure out how evil girls can be. Not in like mean bitchy ways, but in like their secretive things. Like, "you ask him this for me, and then you tell me what he said after" or "oh mi gosh, so and so just told me who he likes" Stuff like that. It's quite amusing in hindsight, and being a girl and all. But I feel sorry for the poor, clueless guys. Hehe, I s'pose girls always were the superior race, neway! Hehe, girls you all know what I'm talking bout!    Ok I sounded like Shannon Noll then. Scary. I don't like Shannon Noll that much. Matter o fact I don't like Guy Sebastian either. I just assosciate them together becuase they were on Australian Idol.     &nbsp;   Mmm...I think I'm learning to touch type. Like not on one of those stupid computer programs&nbsp;at school where they try and get u to learn them. But just because I am on the compuet so often chatting to people and blogging all the time, that I just seem 2 know where all the keys are. Hmmm...that's cool. But I s'pose it's not a good sign, seeing as I'm on the computer so much I'm learning to touch type. Maybe my brain will turn to mush becuase of all the radiaton waves. Hehe...hmmm how interesting. That stupid program at school never worked on me. Becuase I cheated and looked down at the keys. Hehe..naughty bethie. But come on you can't blame me, it was deathly boring.     &nbsp;   How cool is the new Blogger posting thing?! So many more things to do, different fonts and sizes and colours and bullet point things and left, centre and right alignments, and uploading images that doesn't work! haha. No wonder Blogger had 2 hours of down time the otha day. How amazing of them to get all this done. Nice work Blogger. Love the new layout, will have to play around with it a bit.     &nbsp;   Hmm mi Mum is like desperate to find my blog. She is getting really pissy at my becuase I won't tell her the address and I will tell my Aunty Cathy. But I can trust Aunty Cathy. Yes I can. Hello if you are reading! Feel proud I can trust you! We had to fill out this thing in PD last year, and it said, who would be the member of your family, extended or wateva, who you would trust to tell if you were preganant at a young age. And I said you Aunty Cathy. So there. I'll be coming to you if I have a problem. :) But don't worry, because I'm not gonna be getting pregnant when I'm a teenager, becuase I'm only having sex with marriage.     &nbsp;   Mmmm...I s'pose I better get bak to reading these archives. Might I add, why is no-one blogging. I am so bored and need contact with the outside world!!   &nbsp;  Amor Omnia Vincit  (and it sure does...)   &nbsp;  Beth

       2day was a cool yet long long day. Gemma and I were rudley awaken in the morning at the ungodly hour of 9.30!! Man it was horrible. It took us like 20mins to get out of bed, because we couldn't even get INTO bed before 12.30 because James was being annoying and wouldn't get out of the room cuz he was watching a movie. Damn James. SO we got like no sleep. And then once we were well and truly up, Mum rang to say that mi ortho was actually half an hour later than she thought so we could hav slept in longer! Argh.. Don't you hate that? Then Gemmie and I took Tish 4 a walk.  Mum came and took Gemma and I with her. The Ortho was a disappointing visit. I won't get mi braces off 4 bout 3 months now, longer than they originally told me. Always happens but is still a bummer. And I was sayin how I was sick of havin stuff on mi teeth, because they happily informed me that after I got mi braces off, I had 2 wear a retainer full time for a year!!! How utterly crap. Then mi ortho goes up to me and says, "U've had your braces on 4 13 months now, and you had your other thing on 4 a year as well, so I think you're overexadurating a bit". I could have punched him. What a loser. That is ages!! And I hav 2 have stupid bands in 4 9 weeks, but I am so not wearing them when I go out. They are so totally horrible. Argh. Stupid ortho.  So then we bought me new clothes, which was good. :D I got 2 new pairs of jeans, a brown jumper and a spearmint top. :) Yay. And then we got food and went home. Gem and I were pushing it fine by then, and so once we got home, I changed, then we left 4 Glenrose 2 meet Mel. We were gonna have coffee, but ended up not. I bought chips and Mel and Gemma ate them all. How nice of them - not! :P Mel also brought apple sliced up in a little bag. Funni anorexic Melli. We saw Steph D and Yusuke, and we crashed their "bonding seesion" and had a chat 4 a while. It was nice. :D Haven't seen Steph in ages. Hehe, she as well was surprised about how much gossip I knew bout church. hehehe...being a gossip queen is fun fun!  So then we headed off to Nats house, Gemma, Mel and I. We arrived and started watchin this realli random movie called "Fried Green Tomatoes" which we gave up on and watched "Signs" instead when T1 and Monty came. So basically it was Nat, T2, T1, Monty, Bec (buckley, standing behind us painting) Jodie, Hannah, Mel, Gemma and I. Jodie was scared in Signs, and we all screamed at exactly the right times, on purpose. Bec found us absolutley hilarious. But T1 was the most scared, he sat there with his head in a pink pillow he was huggin rocking back and forth, and it was soo funni. Ash Bennet came 4 about half an hour after the movie finished. She had a hair cut and it was soooo cool!! We all had a nice chat 4 ages. The 3 guys had a wrestling fight, and it was quite scary. Hehehe...Mel kept on making unsubtle hints.  It was obvious who Monty likes, even thought he only narrowed it down 2 2people 4 me the otha day, but won't admit who it is now that I'm sure I know. The day was pretty good. But I am so totally exhausted. I was fallin asleep at the end of the evening.   I miss you.  Blogging off, Beth

       Gemma and I were just eating dinner (spag bol, mmmmm) and Gem was saying how she wanted 2 change her screensaver to that weirdo maze thingo. And then we had a flashback memory of the good 'ol Mimosa days, where Mrs. Crummy (the librarian) would be talking, and we would all be sitting in front of her, not listening, just concentrating on the maze screensaver on the computer behind her. Haha. She got very frustrated. Ahhh...good times, ay Gem? Good times.....

       Hey y'all. I'm at Gemma's house. Bloggin on her brand new flat screen computer in her room. Lucky thing. We just went and saw Lion King at the Capitol Theatre. It was soooo amazing! The sets and costuming definatley. And also the little kid who played little Simba was sooo cute. Same 4 Narla. He even did a handspring, sure not a very good one, but i don't think ne1 else noticed, and he was cute so I 4give him. :D I think I'm sleeping ova at her place. Eh'xcelent. Rite now Gemma is strumming a VERY off-tune guitar. I was hoping to play it, but it's so off-tune, it's beyond hope. Shame really. I have an ortho appointment tomorrow at 10.00. Yay. I'm gettin mi braces off soon. 2 and half months. Gosh. Can't wait. I'm totally ova braces now. They're such a hassle man. Mmmm....lifes good, ay? I'm glad u don't hate me nemore Hannah. Yay. Life's very very good. Thanks God. U rule. Thats all 4 now. Just mi thoughts. Beth

       I just remembered, that it was really funny, cuz in the middle of the movie, a guy on the movie goes "Now you know what really makes girls fall in love with you...poetry!" And everyone in the group started laughing, and looked ova at Luke and I, and I was laughing and looking at Luke and he just slid down in his seat and went bright red. It was a quite hilarious. And the fact that the movie said it was also funny. And also...Westie got lost at lunch. And we neva found him. U'd think it'd be easy seeing as he is so tall, but nup, we lost him and neva found him! Poor Westie.   I wonder where Westie is now.....

       What is ur love language? Choose from these below. They are the "5 languages of love"  Its from sum book or anotha.  Anyway the choices are... -> physical touch -> words of affirmation -> acts of service -> meaningful gifts -> quality time  So what do u think urs is?    If I had 2 say me personally I'd probably say: words of affirmation/quality time as first, but physical touch comes close after. I mean it's totally needed as well, what would a relationship be without it?! Like some people don't kiss until their married. I mean how weird is that? I mean, if I didn't kiss in the relationship, then it wouldn't really be a proper relationship. It's just such a weird thing to think about. Not kissing....hmmmmm....weeeeiird

       Saw Spidey 2 2day with Luke, Pete H, Joel, Anika, Jodie, Mel, Gemma, Hannah S and Bec. I was lucky enuf 2 get a lift in and home with Hannah. :D The movie was better than I thought it would be actually. Good as the first. Loads of action. The end totally set it up for the next one though. Gemma tried to force me to eat lunch after, but I could only eat half my Twister. I had to stop or I would hav thrown up. I don't know what's wrong with me! Why can't I eat? Luke and I had to endure yet another few hours of unsubtle hints and "awwwwws", but you know, I'm sure they'll get over it soon. Right, right?! haha. Oh well. It's all worth it. Hannah W please don't hate me.

       extracting from Rach:  "Love is in the air at the moment. There's a sudden couple influx at church, which is quite exciting. It's plaguing both my generation (ie Lozza & Chris, Bec & Matt), and the younger generation (Beth & Luke). Of course, being 3-4 years younger than me, they're classified as a whole other generation. Now if there was some cross-generational dating, we'd have a church scandal. How fun, and perhaps inappropriate, all at the same time."    Hehe,  urlLink Rach  once again tickles my funni bone. Go the cross-generational dating! Haha. I say  urlLink Mel  should initate this, i mean she knows all the "older generation" well neway. ;) And isn't it funny how we classify such a short age difference as a generation. Quite interestingly funny really... But I'm glad the frigid non-dating church community, (whether it be Ernie Sr, Ernie Jr (which is beating Ernie Sr in the love stakes which is quite sad) or Rach's generation) trend may finally be breaking... Bring it on Ernie Sr! Come on we can beat those Jr's!!  Bring ooonnn the luurve

       Mel and I had a bummy day 2day. Woke up at 9:30am and atyed in bed till 11.00! We both lay in bed listening to Tom's sermon and cacking ourselves! Tom u r one funny guy. And what an amazing sermon. It was funy, yet still related to me today. I thought it was great. :D 'Snaps 4 Tom' And we stayed in our PJ's ALL day! :D Eh'xcelent! And then Mel and I spent basically the rest of the day being musos, and get this - we wrote our own song on the guitar!! I'm so excited. I've always wanted 2 write one, but I never thought I would be able to. Though thanks to God we could. We read his word, and prayed 4 his help and inspiration a few time, combined our limited knowledge together (i've been playing guitar 4 5 days, and mel 4 bout a month or so) and voila, we have a song!! It's called "Soul of the Earth" and i love it sooo mcuh! I would love it to be played in Church one day. That wouldbe truly awesome. Mi life is pretty much perfect now (and yes it's more than the one obvious reason that alll of your gossip queens are thinking) except for one thing. I tried my hardest to reconcile, but she didn't want to. It's very sad. She was one of my really good friends. I don't know what happened. It almost doesn't seem fair. :( But I tried, and I will forgive, and I hope she will forgive me for whatever "horrible" thing I did to her that I have no idea of. Time will tell, and it heals all wounds. But on a kind of good note, I now know who anonymous is, thanks to Luke's computer detective skills. 'Snaps 4 Luke' So yeh, mi day in a blog. Bi Bi all. Luv ya Beth

       Well, today. It was the most amazing, surreal day ever. It felt like it was many many days combined, and now the day is over the result has me overwhelmed. Well, in case you didn't know, seeing as the whole church, and pretty much the whole world knows. Luke and I are going out. That was just 4 all of you who hav been living in a hole and don't know! (and Hannah W u didn't know yet because i couldn't get onto you!) So neway, we went 2 coffee bout 11.00, and Luke lost track of time, so he had 2 go, but he gave me this poem he had written. A very romantic poem. Pretty much self-explanatory of feelings and hopes 4 our future poem. So I'm walking home in the rain reading it, in disbelief, smsing luke 2 double check its bout me, yup is, yeh feelings mutual etc. Yes! It is. Yay :D So everythings pretty much perfect :) Love is an amazing thing.  So then Mel and I hang out and chill, being the amazing musos we r, play the guitar basically the whole time. I learned 3 new songs, Here I am To Worship, Feels Like Home, and This Kiss. This Kiss is Mel's fave, shes playing it right now in mi room! :) So we shot off 2 church, which we were both totally looking forward 2 going 2 because we had missed it, the service was good. Sermon good, Sal was very enthusiastic and full of spirit 2 say the least! Although I couldn't fully enjoy it because I was feeling a bit light headed. It was very hot in there. Don't know what Tom's talking bout it being cold!! Oh and on the topic of Tom, he gave me his sermon on CD!! Yay! 'Snaps 4 Tom' Ur a champ Tom! Moving on...but then after I went out 2 the front to be prayed 4, and it was the most amazing feling. All my friends surrounding me praying for me, and I felt so full of spirit, and close to God again! Thankyou Lord, for everything. And the best thing yet, is i actually feel accepted in the group now!! I dunno why, I just do. We went 2 Macca's after. Our group took up pretty much the whole place, and we filled the roles of evil, raucous teenagers very well! :) Pete H FINALLY found out who I am!! 'Bout time too! Ahh, meh, he'll prob. end up 4getting me again neway. The whole day was just so great, dreams coming true, feeling accepted, and being closer 2 god now. Oh and the guitar!! 'Snaps 4 guitar' So yeh, I betta b off, can't leave Mel 4 much longer! Blogging off, an extremley contented and thankful, Beth

       Hmmm, just thinking bout Bailey's. It is so damn nice. Mi fave i think. I don't really like beer or red wine that much. White wine's alright, but I much prefer the lolly alochol drinks, like Bacardi. Loaded with alcohol, but don't taste much like it. Really sweet. Creamy's good too. I love cocktails. Don't like the strong stuff too much. Mi aunty bought me a margerita or a martini (can't remember which one), and the vodka in it blew me away. Strong taste of yucki vodka, then yummy aftertaste after. I didn't know if I liked it or not. Finished it though. Not too fond of vodka, hmmm...its alrite tho, not that bad. Maybe my alochol tastes will mature with time...

       Mi night with Jess, Gemma and Ali started off with a few shots of Baileys and milk which we stole from Jess's Dad's liquor cupboard while they were out. Just like a choclate milkshake..only very alcoholic! And delicious. Mmmm...gotta luv it. After the effects of the shots wore off we watched a few movies, one of them a very bad once called Fear. And we read magazines. Then we hyped up again, and shoved pillows down our pyjama tops and had sumo fights. Now that was fun. Jess's mum looked slightly perplexed at the humor in it. We ended up nodding off round 2:00am, not because we were tired, but because we thought we should and we were keeping Jess's parents up. We had a very rude wake-up call in the morning from Mel. All our phones rang at least once in a 10min interval. It was the worst wake-up call I've ever had. Mel was waaay too hypo on the phone that early in the morning! I mean, come on, it's 10:30!! We eventually dragged ourselves out of bed, and Jess and Ali made pancakes while Gemma and I sat at the window talking about girly things, including which guys are hot and which r not at church. Hehe, jsut a little inncent fun. I didn't eat brekkie, opting to play "Fur Elise" on the piano instead. (i dont like breakfast, or eating that much food in the day at all actually, mi hunger kicks in at night!) Then we hung around and talked 'till our parents picked us up, and I did a 1km erg! (4 those of you who don't know what an erg is, its a rowing mcahine thing, and jess has her own 1 in her room, at the small cost of $2000!!!!) I didn't even break a sweat, but that's prob. because I did it wrong! Haha I'm glad 2 get home now. In guitar deprival mode. I'm teaching miself "Innocent Eyes" bi Delta now. :) Blogging off, Beth

       I'm teaching myself how to play the guitar! I'm so excited. First song I'm teaching myself is Pete Murray - So Beautiful (mi fave song in the world) and I'm also attempting to learn Tim Hughes - Here I am to Worship, but I'm waiting for Mel to come back so she can help me with that once, because she supposdley has the higher, easier veriosn of it or something. Wow, I'm so excited. Last night I was all depresso and feeling apart from the Lord, so I just randomly thought, I'm gonna play the guitar! Yay. And I was practicing until like 11.00pm. hehe, its so fun, I think I'm doing it all wrong and everything, but it doesn't matter because I'm enjoying myself and feeling a bit happier!

       hmmm. i feel like blogging. Life has been, well, how can i describe it? Strange, really lately. I dunno, everything just seems so surreal. And sometimes things seem to fly by, then other times it goes so slowly. I'm confused about things (but then again when am i ever not?) I feel apart from God, i don't know why but I just do. Lord come close to me again. My friends seem differnet, some of them have just changed. People I think I know turn around and suddenly say things and do things that are entirley not them. And I don't know whats happened. Did I do somthing? How can things change so quickly? In a split second my life is different. And new friends. I never thought I would feel closer to them, people I have only known for a few months, than my friends I have known for years. I don't know if I feel accepted in the group. The guys seem to accept me, yes, the girls are close to it, but I dunno, there's just something there. I'm not totally in yet. Maybe it's just a girl thing. Hmmm..so many decisions I have to make. I mean what really is my life? It seems to fly by. New additions come and go as they please. Think back to my primary school days. What mattered? My hair, my friends, my schoolwork? I wasn't a Christian. God didn't matter. My friends, my best friend, Bianca. 2 years later and she's all gone. It's like she's a mist, she just floated away into the breeze but I can still sense her. We were going to be friends forever we said, we'd see each other every weekend. I haven't seen her in a year. I miss her. But I know things can never be the same. I drifted away from my Mimosa friends group to my Roseville group. I only just realised I feel close to half of my group at school. The others don't know me. They can never know me. And now Church, the Church group is getting stronger. I'm so close to being fully accepted I can smell it. I love it. I love God. I love Jesus. I love Church. I love evangelism. I love my friends. I have so many things. Yet I constantly want more. Is just a human fault or is it me? If I ever acheive what I want, will i be happy? Or will I forget about that thing and want more? So many questions, so little answers. I love him, or do I? Do I know what love is? Why are people so mean? The truth is so harsh, sheltering myself from finding it out from him will make what I know is inevitable less painful. People pronounce it, because they know my weaknessess and use it against me. They know what I fear most, and so they say it. They tease me with it. "Get over it Beth" or "He'll never love you Beth" or "You're worthless Beth" Am I? Do I believe it? Can I believe what people tell me? Who can I believe? No-one. Humans cannot be trusted. I can believe Jesus. But its so hard, I feel he's not always there. Everythings so hard. I have to evaluate some things and some people. How important are they to me? How important is my life to me? Sure its life and I have to accept it. But sometimes I just wish it was all over. I wish my final destination was reached and I could live in harmony with God in heaven for all of eternity.

       Hey i just realised, that today, while the guys were trying to get the swing down, they achieved a very good cheerleading pyramid, known 2 MelissaNSC as an  urlLink elevator . Hav a look at the pic of it, and change it to T1 and Luke struggling on the bottoms next 2 a swing, and Monty on top fiddling with the swing chain. Hehe, it was funny. Now there's a Kodak moment 4 you. Isn't it a shame we didn't have that camera on us...  They would have made good cheerleaders...  Shame really  Haha

       Well today I spent the majority of my day on a fun journey with Monty, T1 and Luke. Just me and the guys... It started off with Monty and Luke doing a very bongled organisation of the day. Luke messaging people, but then his phone dying before anyone could reply, and then e-mailing people in the library at 12.00 saying come and have lunch with us at 12.30, Great, jsut great. They arrived at my house about 12.15 to pick me up and we then journeyed to T1's house and picked him up, all the while Luke and Monty gleefully showed me how they had started an eventually unsuccessful game of 'The Soap Game' (starting off with soap and swapping it with people for somthing of equal or greater value) They had got a little pot of, well, pot. Naa not really, it was Chinese Tea leaves, but it sure looked and smelt like pot! The game ended here seeing as no-one wanted 2 swap it for anything. So we ventured to the park behind the Church (this is where people were 'sposed to meet, but no-one showed up) Tom wasn't in the Church Centre, so he missed out on our wonderfully nutritious lunch, which consisted of little packets of chips, bread and sunkist and lemonade. We sat on the seesaw which wasn't a very good choice, but it sure ws funny 2 be on, seeing as all of our stuff was knocked around. I felt like 'one of the guys' as we sat there, burping after drinking and all, talking about such things as, weight, drugs and alcohol, including where is the best place 2 stash it, and funny drug stories, which included people who called up the police because some1 stole their marijuana plants, and we then moved on to the most painful way we've hurt ourselves, and Luke showed us his war scars. Luke and I had pretty much the best pain stories, which was nails through both of his feet and a rusty nail straight through my hand (we all know THAT story...) while T1 sat there wincing in pain at what we had gone through. Haha. We then saw Helen drive up, and we all came and had a nice chat with her. It's great to have her back. I missed her :) We then proceeded to go to the swings, where Monty swung the swing around the pole so it was really high up, and then swung on it, shame we didn't have a camera on us. It was quite a funny scene. But trying 2 get it down was the real effot. All Luke acheived was getting the swing up much higher, and getting it tangled around the bolt. So the guys spent the next 20 minutes attempting to get this swing down back to its normal level, while I stood there laughing. We chatted some more, then Luke asked the time, and once again he had to rush off, and he nearly missed his bus. He's getting quite a rep with me now... Monty and T1 then walked me home, while we amused ourselves by kicking the empty Sunkist bottle in front of us. It eventually went on the road, and a car was coming along and T1 kicked it straight at the car by accident. It was quite funny. But yeh, that was my day. Did i mention it was quite cold?

         Well, this is mi poem. Just as it is. Just me. If you like it, that's great. If you don't like it, then well, it's your choice. Enjoy.  Never let me go. My heart yearns for you. You make me so happy, you make my world spin.  There's something in your smile, makes my heart beat fast. There's something in your eyes, that sends chills down my spine. There's something in your voice, makes my heart sing strong.  If you knew how much I wanted you to love me. You'd never be the same.  I feel at home with you, I'm lost when you're not near. Life is not worth living, if it is without you.  My love for you is so powerful, it takes my breath away. My love is so strong, it can move mountains.  I've waited so long for your touch, I never thought I'd love anyone just this much.  Where I belong is in your arms, and you in mine. Kiss me, hug me; I want to lose myself in you.  My love is everlasting. You call, or we talk, and my heart sings.  Ever since I met you, my life has changed. What I want most; I can't have.  Wherefore art thou? My Romeo is near; but to you I am not your Juliet.  My signals you cannot see, the darkness has engulfed me. I need your light and protection, but we are lost from each other.  If it was this easy to find you, I should be ready for a fall.  Like a bird I keep on flying; searching for you, making you strong. You never know when you might have to fly. Will you go after me?  The person I once was, is gone. Love has taken me. My true love; is gone. Flown away, to another nest.    I can't believe I posted that...private thoughts on the internet. oh gosh.

       2day I went 2 see Shrek 2 with the massivest group eva. We had....(ok this may take a while and I apologise if i 4get ne1!) Luke, Joel, Tim McCloud, Tim Buckley, Monty, Bec, Nat, Jodie, Ash Bennet, Megan, Gemma, Hannah W and me and I 4get the otha person that makes it 14!! Ooops... So neway we saw Shrek 2. It was soooo good, realli funni!! I suggest every1 see it. Basically everyone was late, T1 told everyone the meeting time was 12.00 and Monty told everyone it was 12.30, which was really good! So half of us were there at 12.00 and waiting around 4 half an hour, and the others were at 12.30. 'Cept Luke and Joel, who were very late, 'cept it was because Joel (silly, silly) left his wallet back at the house and they had 2 go back and get it which took them an extra half-hour. We got food at the food court b4 the movie, and we saw Caitlin Casey and Bubs there, and Caitlin had turned goth and had bought these $430, physco ugly black and fire like combat boot thngs. It was soo crazy!! But yeh, that was basically it. It was bad 2 see that the guys and girls didn't merge and sit next 2 each other, it was basically girls one side, guys otha (and hannah w and gemma were lonered and had 2 sit on two loner seats heaps far away behind us, and so they missed out on heaps of the food, and they were chucking 5 cent coins at us so we could give them food, but it didn't work, and all it acheived was that gemma lost one of her "prized" 5 cents - haha) so I was the only 1 who sat next 2 a guy. Shame, shame. And back 2 Luke's discussion on the whole hugging issue. No-one hugged goodbye! Well 'cept the girls, but no guys. Shame, shame again. Apart from all those shames it was pretty good. I'm glad the 2nd movie didnt ruin the first, like Legally Blonde 2, ugh that was totally dissapointing.    I'm also just wondering 'bout whether I should post a poem that I wrote while I was away. It's called "Le Deux" (its french, not the poem, just the title) and it's basically bout unrequited love. I dunno if I should put it up, I'm not a sharing my poetry person, cuz it's private, and also people will prob. read into it, tho I spose there is sumthing 2 read into, but kinda not. I'm so confused....bout everything 2 post or not 2 post.

       Canberra. Trip was crazy. Started off with Casey coming over a few hours before we left. She brought a bag the size of one of those carry-on make-up cases, no joke. Mum told her to  pack lightly , and Casey took her seriously. Hung around for a few more hours, dreading leaving, until we eventually got a move on. We got 5 minutes off the way, and Michael goes,  "Mum, I'm hungry!! When are we going to be there?" , Mum replied in a slightly annoyed tone,  "Michael, we're only in  Belrose !!"  Casey murmurs:  "Ahhhhhh, the Twilight Zone...."  So we're driving along, bout an hour into the trip and there is this big accident on the highway, so Dad decides to take a detour into this back road to get around the traffic. But unfortunatley, everyone else had the same idea, so we were all stuck in traffic in the back streets of "Lebanon" as Mum called it (it was actually Chullora, which is basically occupied bi Lebanese people) Dad was getting really impatient. It was veerry funny. All of the neighbours were coming outside to see what was going on. Here is a dialogue that actually happened that Casey and I created after:   A recipe for a dysfunctional family: Take two young, physco, farting boys, two uncontrollably argumentative parents, and one cheerleader, put them into a car for 5 hours and you have Beth's dysfunctional family. Add KC into the mix and you've got hell! Driving through the streets of Lebanon: Boys: "Fart, Fart. Who pulled my hair? Muuum, Callum's farting again! I'm hungry!" Dad: Look, now we're off the way! A half an hour wait now!! I'll jsut drive up onto the sidewalk so I can get one car ahead!" Mum: Don't you dar you impatient man! You're setting a bad example to the kids! Calm down! Caaalllm down!" Beth: (clapping) Be aggressive, be, be, aggressive! Casey: (singing) We're all going on a (clap) summer holiday! Everyone: Shutup Casey!!   After we escaped the clutches of the evil "Lebanon" and everyone had calmed down after all the excitement, Casey got a message on her fone. It was from Barney (aka. Adrian, KC's bro) The message read: Where are you? KC replied by saying: Canberra you loser! He actually didn't know where she was! Haha. That's Barney 4 ya! And we played "Eye Spy with my big, fat, pussy, bleeding eye" which was  SO MUCH FUN!! Not!!!   After we arrived in Canberra we drove into our accomodation which was "Carotel Motel" which was this really shotty, hole of a place, and I ran into our "Villa House" (2 bedrooms, a loungeroom and a toilet/bathroom, all crammed into like 20 square metres) and started screaming  "It's a hole! Hole! Canberra's a hole!"  While Mum got increasingly annoyed at me! Haha. So Mum, Dad and the boys decided to go out 4 a ride, 2 start the training 4 the competiton that was on on Saturday. So KC and I were left alone. 1 TV station, no radio, all alone, 2 degrees, no food, surviving on gum, bored out of our  MINDS , KC found blood on the floor and we were teriffied, and we had no civilisation apart from my mobile phone. We were in a desperate situation until Luke called mi mobile and saved us! Well me at least. KC was lonered. :p Haha. Luke and I talked 4 an hour (actually 43mins 59secs according 2 mi fone) and it was a great relief from mi boredom! Thankyou Luke! Haha, only I feel bad about the money issue. That's gonna b a big phone bill 4 Luke! Whoops! We went out 4 dinner at Zefferelli's pizza place. It was 2 degrees outside and we saw a girl in a mini-skirt!! When we were walking 2 the restaurant, KC and I were threatening 2 scream out such stuff as,  "Canberra's a hole, Sydney rox!"  and  "Why did they put a fence around Canberra? So people wouldn't fall in!"  But Mum stopped us. Shame really. Haha. The only good thing about Canberra, might I just add, is that it has sooo many bums!! (aka. hobos, homeless people) I love bums! I think they r soo cool! And all the bums at Canberra stand at the traffic lights and wash ur windscreen 4 money. They r soo cool. Mi fave one had orange scraggly hair and a fag in his mouth. He walked right up 2 and past our car as well. Gosh that got us excited. U know I don't actually know anyone who doesn't like bums. Mi family (minus mum and dad) like bums, and mi group at school. hehe. 'Cept maybe hannah, she was chased bi one. But really, Canberra has the coolest bums!! Might i add, Casey and I had 2 share a room with both of my brothers, and the snoring was terrible!! What is it with guys...  Next day Mum wanted us 2 go site-seeing. Oh yay!! We had 2 go to War Memorial first. And we had a 2 and a 1/2 hour tour, with this 85 year old lady. Mum enjoyed it, but no-one else did. I had soo many SMS's while I was in there, and i eventually had to turn mi fone on silent becuase Mum said i was being "disrespectful". Next we had 2 go to Parliment House. Wow, how lucky are we, two of the most boring places in earth right after each other. Once again, Mum wanted us 2 have the tour, because if we don't we "don't learn anything" Mi god, that wouldn't be good would it! It's called a  holiday!!  We're not 'sposed 2 learn! So Casey and I were waiting 4 the tour in this foyer place at the top of the marble staircase, and we saw all these school groups go past, and we started calling out all this stuff 2 them like,  "Don't worry, it'll all be over soon", "We feel your pain!" and "Hang in there, you'll soon be out of this hole!"  The kids and us exchanged thumbs up, but we got many-a greasys from the school teachers!! Haha We had a "pretending Casey was one of the family" day. :D Mel came over 2 nite. Seeing as she was passing through from Sussex 2 the Snow, and she came and visited! And she found out that Mitch was gonna be here (he was staying next 2 us, he's mi famous cycling cuz whom she is obsessed with) and we were sitting outside talking (even tho it was bout 3 degrees) and  we organised 4 Mitch 2 come ova afta he finished dinner. 'Cept Alexe came and picked Mel up and literally 2 minutes after she left Mitch came!! It was soo funny! And he's got a really cool new haircut!  The next day was the first day of "The ACT State (which doesn't really make any sense becuase ACT isn't a state) Road Championships" Veerry boring. The only good thing bout it was that we were literally surrounded by hot, half-naked, muscly cyclists in lcyra!! Haha. There was this one guy who kept on laughing at mi brothers. Ha. Don't blame him, they were being pretty stupid. Callum went alright (15th and 18th) but he has lots of competiton in his divison. Michael went really well (2nd and 3rd) The trip there was the funny bit. It's about a 40min drive from our hole hotel, and when we got there, Dad tried 2 park, and he backed right into this ditch thingo, and then we were stuck, and he tried 2 get out, and all this smoke was coming from the back of the car, then the exhaust blew up and this big fireball of grass shot out and we got out of the ditch. It was funny enuf (espescially since everyone was looking!) except that he  DID IT TWICE!!  Haha. That's mi Dad 4 u. 2nite we went out 2 dinner at ElDerado's and towards the end of the meal, Dad was eating slices of oranges and lemons, and when he ate them, he'd rocket back and make this weird face expression and sounds, and this was called his "Power Boost". It was so funny! He nearly knocked over a waiter! We milked it 4 all its worth, and made him have about 20 "Power Boosts" When we got home Mum made us go to bed early because the boys had  "big day ahead of them" and everyone was in bed and asleep (minus KC and I) by 8.30!! So obviously KC and I couldn't sleep. There were all these phsyco loud teenagers from the NSW soccer team or sumthing running around outside cuz they were staying here too. And KC had a window next 2 her bed that looked outside. So KC and I were sitting there watching the kids outside through the window, and we were waiting 4 sum of them 2 go past so we could say  "Pssst..Hey Kid come here!"  and when they came over Casey wanted to say -  "Apple?!...." and "Bootstrap?!"  Haha, mi gosh it was funni. We got pretty close 2 acheiving our goal. But KC stuffed it up in the end. :P  Next day was the last day of competitons, and Callum got another 11th and he got a 2nd, but they disqualified all the riders, becuase of what one group did. It was a very controversial decision, and a bit complicated, but yeh, basically that was counted as a no race, so Callum didn't get his silver medal. Michael got two more 3rd places, and he came 3rd overall, he got 2 ACT State Champ medals (both bronze) and $40 prize money. Mitch came 4th overall, and got a MUCH bigger amount of money!! Uncle Warren once again displayed how obsessed he was with setting me up with guys (everytime he comes over he says stuff like,  "So do you have a boyfriend?"  and  "Why haven't I met your boyfriend"? ) by saying,  "Oooo, Beth, any guys take you fancy? It's a great place 2 look 4 a boyfriend. There's lots of cute half-naked cyclists here (scary that he was thinking what i was! haha (last part tho) )"  Ahhh...he's a lost cause that one. We passed our friend the bum, but Mum wouldn't let him wash our car! :(  Finally we were going home!!!! Michael asked if  "We were going back to Australia now?"  It was basically a pretty boring trip seeing as all of our Discmans had conked out. I spent most of the trip asleep. Nice interval of Delta music that I enjoyed singing along 2 at the top of my voice. Gotta luv Delta. Constant bickering in the car tho. Espescially towards the end. We were  ALL  glad 2 get home!! And guess where the first place i went when I got home was? The computer.....  A strange trip in the ultimate capital hole of Australia (ironic actually), filled with bums, bootstraps and high tempers.  Blogging off, Beth

       Hehe, Renata is such a freak. She just walked past our classroom. We just realised she was in the next room, behind the "double-sided-mirrors-that-are-not-up-to-pymble's-standards-becuase-they-are-cheap-and-you-can-see-through-them!" and she has 4gotten that we are her class!! We are all just sitting in this room fiddling with computers, half of us blogging and the other half watching random videos of stuff, and all at the same time having a chat. Come on, we are multi-tasking females and she is a dumb idiot who cannot put two and two together and realise she has a class!!!! Haha, but im not complaining! A whole, bludgy class on the computers without damn RENATA!

       Hello, yet anotha ICT class blog. Yet this time "RENATA" is not here yet so I can attempt to blog properly!! mwhahaha 4 once school has actually been fun 2 day! Well, funny. Embaressingly funnny. Extreamley embaressing. Bates and the tutor group "oooing" and shannon making up stupid chants and screaming things down the corridor. God, when will they get ova it?! Haha. Tho i must admit it was quite hilarious. Altho i was extreamley embaressed at the same time!! I was like BRIGHT RED!!!! The day has also been sad. I can't reveal details becuase Annie swore me to secrecy. But also Annie is gonna leave 4 St.Andrews at the end of the year, and that is totally sad!! :( But the worst and most unfair part of it is the bit i can't tell. But trust me its bad. Oh i'm so frustrated. Poor poor annie. Science was a total bludge. Because we both couldnt b bothered 2 do any work, and Annie didnt come into the class until near the end and we had 2 console her, and mel was laughing at mi mank goanna fossil drawing which was extreamley hilarious, i soooo could not be bothered 2 do work, i just cant wait till 2nite! It's gonna be fun, in more ways than one! And no that was NOT a hint, 4 all u dirty minded people out there who hav been hassling me 2day!! I am excited because...oops sorry, secret!! Mwhahaha...Anika knows! Hehe, secrets r fun. Well if they are harmless of course. Bt these secrets r generally harmless. I remember ages ago when I used 2 haveaaaaalll these secrets bout people at church and I couldnt tell, and one time i got totally stressed out bout it becuase mel wanted 2 know sumthing and i couldnt tell her 4 a very good reason and it got all very ugly!! Hhe, its so cute because there is this guy who likes Jess called Jack, and hes really sweet, because he calls her every night, and he asked her 2 the movies, his shout, and jess says its not a date. but we all say it is! Guys, I need your opinion on this one please!! Is it a date or not? I think it could be. But y'know it could also not. Because I went out 2 coffee with luke like twice or sumthin b4 we started going out and it wasnt a date. But yeh, i bet that Jack guy likes her anyway. He's sposed 2 be hot as well. mayb he has shaggy hair? Shaggy hair is hot! hot hot hot.... Even jess's drama teacher thinks its a date, gem and jess were discussing it, and she walks past, and just goes. "It's a date!" and then keeps on walking! Haha. How random and funny! Argh! So excited bout 2nite! And world cafe!! hehehehe Mwahahaha, life's good again!! Maybe its becuase ive caught up on sleep! Ok maybe ill go and finish this post and then read sum other peoples blogs!! yay yay! Renata STILL isnt here! shes like 15mins late! Eh'xcellent! Blogging off, beth

       I was cleaning up my room,  and I found my psalm that we had 2 write in Ernie last week. I thought I might share it with you. These were the questions and things we had to answer in the psalm:   I choose to worship...   Where?   When I'm feeling...   By remembering...   And this is my effort:   I will worship you when I'm down,   When I am feeling alone, or lost.   Wherever you take me Lord,   I will follow, and sing praise in your name.   For the mighty joy of the Lord's love will help   me to worship in whatever situation I am in.   I will remember how you told me to be patient,   but eventually you answered my prayers.   You brought him into my life.   Thankyou Lord.   I will remember your love for me,   and the atoning sacrifice of your son,   Lord Jesus Christ.   You helped me to grow in you, you made me,   you carried me, you saved me.   I love you Dad.   There is nothing like it, and no greater joy or comfort   than knowing you are saved and that the Lord is with you.   And I will worship in your name, forevermore,   through trials and tribulations,   I will always be there to worship you,   because that is the least of what you deserve,   and you are always there for me.   Amen.

        Pick up line of the day:  "My hands are cold...will you warm them for me? My lips are cold...will you warm them for me? My body's cold...Will you warm it for me?"    This is the pick-up line made up by mi crazy group (well actually kinda mainly me and Gem - hehe) based on the stupid "West Side Story" movie we had 2 watch the otha day. If u don't find it as hilarious as we did, it's becuase it's more of a personal joke, oh and i 'spose we do hav a strange kind of sense of humor, oh and yeh u would kinda hav had 2 see the movie was well! Which i suggest you dont cuz it sucks!! mwhahaha...  I blew off suggestions of me using it. Haha.  I wonder when my friends will get over all the hinting?!   *Mwah*

       Hello again. History afta CCG was funny. Miss. Munday, our teacher, recently got engaged, and Pip C (this really annoying blonde bimbo girl) is like all excited bout it. And she's like, "Aww...Miss Munday, you're even writing different (note Pip's BAD USE OF GRAMMAR!! haha) beacuse you're in looooovvee!!" Good 'ol Miss Munday just laughed. Kiera is also making a board game 4 CCG. Except hers is really morbid and dark. It's called "Who Wants to Destroy Australia?" and to win, you have to kill the most people and rob the government of the most money. Haha. It's hilarious. SO typically Kiera though. I can't wait 2 see the final product! At lunchtime, once again we put the bin in the middle of our circle of chairs, and kicked it around. Haha. We have the weirdest group! Half of us hate the bin kicking and half of us love it. And Julia took heaps of pics of us on her camera. Ranging from "Tree Lovers" to "Stacks on Jess!!!!" hehehehe.... 'Tears of Heaven' is an extreamly hard song 2 play!! Argh! Andy says I'm going alright, but yeh i dunno. I 'spose I have only just started. But I really wanna learn the song cuz its sooo cool!! :D Guitar was quite nice though. It was all warm inside, and Andy had placed the heater right behind my chair so it was all warm for me!! He's a really sweet guy! :D And he also made me a hot Milo when I came in. Yuuuumm...I was all warm and toasty and having heaps of fun! :) 'Snaps 4 Andy!' Tensions are running high in our household. Everyone is sick, and my brother and Dad just had a screaming fight becuase Dad wanted Callum 2 go in the shower but he didn't want 2 get off the computer. Hehe, he's gonna be REALLY angry when he sees ME on it! Mwhahaha.... Y'know this week seems like it's gonna be alright actually. After a shocker like last wk I'm glad!! Bloggin off, Beth

       Hello, I am in CCG and we r researching natural disasters. It is incredibly boring And it very hard to type this becuase Huge is patrolling I just finished havin Chapel God it is seriously boring. We had to sing that Shine, Jesus, Shine song, and it is sooo high, and my voice totally wont go there 2day because I am getting sick. :( And I've lost my glasses. So I'm like blind and can't read nething that is further than an arms length away. Ahhh, my poor glasses, wandering around the school somewhere, all by themselves. I hope they turn up soon. Mel and Annie and I had a plaster fight in Science Mrs. Hallet was very brave to give us an experiment 2 do that involved plaster. The expected outcome was acheived: plaster on us, on the science bench, on our aprons, on our faces and blazers, the experiment totally stuffed, and us rolling on the floor laughing. Ahhh, good times. And Kranny tried to get us into trouble on our way to school. We had already gone 2 SSO and were in the school gounds and didnt have our blazers on (which is totally allowed!) and she comes up to us and is all like - "Girls, you should have your blazers on!" And we're like, "But we're in the school grounds, we dont have to" And she didnt believe us that we had had them on coming in (which we didn't, but y'know she doesn't need 2 know that) and so she went 2 SSo to ASK THEM if we had been there! Haha. How stupid! Well obviously we didnt get in trouble though! Mwhahahaha.... Yay. I'm excited. I have a jam packed weekend which is good. Friday is small group and sleepout which I'm totally excited bout, and Gem is staying at mi place the whole weekend (Fri, Sat and SUn) because her parents r going away, and Sat Mel and I r trying 2 organise a thing with church people at either my house or hers, and I might try and fit something else in on Sat, maybe helping Jo advertise for World Cafe or somthing. I'll have to figure out my prioritys first. And I'm sure I'm doing sumthing Sunday day but right now I can't remember!! But the usual stuff is on, dance, ernie, church. Oh and yay Mel and I r performing our song 4 Ernie so we have to bring our guitars! Hehe..such musos. :D yay. I like weekends. School totally sux But I REALLY better go because I'm kinda abandoning my group here and I'm sposed 2 be working, so farewell all! Blogging off, Beth

I hate missing people. Mel and I wrote our song 4 Ernie and it is really funny! Hehe. And we even managed to chuck in some advertising for World Cafe. I like our Tuesdays. They're good stuff they are. Mmm..I dont have much else to say. Wow. Now THAT is strange.

       Hmm..I dont really feel like blogging. But I will. Just 4 the sake of it. 2 day I had 2 catch the bus. But while Mel and KC and I were waiting at the bus stop this white car drove up 2 us, and it was Laura (Yr12 from our school) and she told us 2 hop in and gave us a lift. It was extreamley funny and cool. She goes - "So I see you guys r not wearing your blazers" And we're like - "Umm..." cept she goes  - "Haha, nice work, keep it up!!" And we had a big bitch about Roseville and all the teachers there. It was hilarious. I was practically choking I was laughing so much. But of course Mum doesn't know I got a lift in with her or she would go off at me. Meh. Her prob. But its better if she doesn't know!! She still doesn't know bout Rob driving me 2 the beach. Haha. She is so clueless. Sorri, but she is. Neway, man I really love this CD that Ash gave me!! Thanx Ash! :D Mmmmm.....school kinda still sux. Hammy had a physco at me  in English becuase Gem, KC, Ellen AND Ali (b4 it was just Gem) kept on giving me these sly suggestive looks weneva young love and love in general really was mentioned (we were doing presentations on Romeo and Juliet) Naturally I laughed at them, but Hammy failed 2 find the humor in the situation. Then we had 2 watch West Side Story, which is one of the worst movies I've eva seen! it was physically painful 2 sit thru it! Argh. Hmmm I'm feeling totally lazy. Lazy bum me. Some people seem 2 be acting differently  latley. Mmm..interesting...strange I'm sooo physced bout World Cafe!! :D Waitressing yeh!! And also bout Winter Sleepout. Yay! Neway I couldn't b bothered 2 type nemore, so i betta b off Beth

       Mmm...life, what a strange yet interesting thing. What makes us feel alone, sad, happy, rejected, lost? You could duplicate the situation you're in for another person and the feelings would be different. We are all so different. Sometimes I wonder what makes us hate or love. Not the scientific answer. Just that feeling you get. The overwhelming and wonderfully consuming feeling when you're with the person you love, or the horrible, sickening feeling around the person whom you hate, or who hates you. What makes that irresistible attraction, and what makes it die? The doubts that come into your head, how only in hindsight do you realise what you once had was perfect. And that now it is not. Time. Time is a strange thing. It can make or break relationships, it can heal the greatest of wounds, and it can spark amazing life-changing change. mmm...will it work? I suppose... time ...will tell.
