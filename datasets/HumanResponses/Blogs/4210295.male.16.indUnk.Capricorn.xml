      ..huhhuh..behold the second tale..huhhuh..today was one of those fucking boring days..huhhuh..when i send an sms to someone, i expect the person to reply..unlike someone i know, didnt even have the decentcy to at least call and say "sorry, there's no credit left in my phone"..you know who you are, you might even read this..its kind of annoying though..but hell, some people are like that..i just dont know what the fucking hell do they wanna proof..huhhuh.. what a fucked up day..went to school..came back home..send sms to 2 classmates..both didnt reply..got so fucking pissed..i just wanted their help to do my fucking school work but they just couldn't bother to answer..huhhuh..maybe i should stop being so nice..always sending sms looking for a topic to chat about..i am always the one who puts himself low and sends an sms first waiting for that friend to reply..if that friend does, the conversation goes on, if theres no reply, i look like a fool, feel like a good for nothing ass..then get real angry but keep it in me..then maybe i might slip out something really bad one day..after i do that, they wont be nice to me as well, then arguements rise, then fights, curses and all that kind of bullshit and crap..why the fuck was the world made in the first fucking place..one comes, lives his life worrying about his future, trying to cover up the sins he did in the past..struggles and becomes someone in life..later gets married..then children..then faces loads of stress raising his children..then when his children grow up, they give him a kick in the ass..leaving him and maybe his wife(if she hasnt left him yet) all alone..just waiting for the day he dies..i see that in my future..huhhuh..another sad tale of misery..sometimes i can be a pathetic gothic believer..even more pathetic than that mother fucking bastard fauwas..huhhuh..see u in HELL!..you mother fucking son of a bitch(fauwas)..see you in HELL!..
