      I read that a year ago was the big blackout of 2003.  I remember it well.  I was totally oblivious to it, as I had daycare children so the television news wasn't on and I had no idea  1/4 of the country was in the dark.  I'm in one of the areas that was dark...exactly  11 miles down the road was the cutoff.  While people 11 miles from me could not turn on lights, I was sitting in air conditioning watching movies and eating microwave popcorn.  Life's weird, isn't it?  And I know I should have felt bad, but I didn't.  I turned that AC to high and sat back and relaxed.  What would I have done if we lost our power for that long?  I would have lost a freezer full of food...deep freezer as well as the one in the fridge.  I would have gone kind of nuts not being able to shower.  Laundry would have piled up.  As long as I could flush the toilet and wash I'd be ok, but having no hot water would suck.  We are so dependent of electricity, right now I have on fans, television, the fridge and freezer of course, the computer, lights...I know that I am a huge energy hog.  But what should I do, turn off one 40 watt lamp or unplug the stereo...would that help?  I'm just thankful that I wasn't one of the "blacked out" people, that we kept our power, and hope to continue to do so.  I like candles for their smell...not as a light source.

      I found something wonderful at the grocery store the other night....footlong hot dogs and buns!  All summer I had seen the hot dogs, but not the buns.  I asked at the store about the buns and they said the didn't have them.  I said, "But you carry the foot long hot dogs!"  Then last week they had several packages of footlong buns hanging by the hot dog case....but no foot long hot dogs in sight.  It makes you wonder, doesn't it?  Who the hell is the Einstein ordering this stuff?  So, anyhow, I now have a package of 6 footlong Koegel's franks and a package of 6 foot long buns and I'm going to grill them today!  There isn't too many things more fun than a foot long hot dog fresh off a charcoal grill.  All you need is a squirt of ketchup (you may need mustard, however, I do not) and you have a whole meal.  If you have some potato chips, it's a bonus day!  Foot long hot dogs were a favorite of my kids.  We would always get them when we went camping, cooking them on a little grill over the fire.  They fall off sticks too easily, but on a grill right over the fire they have that same taste.  So, today I shall have my foot long hot dog.  And I shall be full!

      Using Fritos scoops to eat your chocolate almond ice cream sounds like a good idea You go shopping and everything in your cart is chocolate flavored and/or drenched in salt You would actually murder someone over M and Ms You want to have a fondue party, make a chocolate fondue, and dip Ruffles into it You can justify eating potato sticks in a can as a "vegetable" You can justify eating double butter, salted popcorn as a "vegetable" You can justify eating candy corn and jelly beans as a "vegetable" The portions in a "Hungry Man" dinner make you giggle.  (too small) You can almost fall asleep walking around And you don't care....

      Lately most of my online friends have abandoned the regular AOL chatrooms for private chats.  Got to keep the riff raff out, you know.  Anyhow, I'm a fan of these rooms because quite frankly, outside of a couple I know well, I really don't care to be pals with teenagers or idiots.  Why is it that in every private chat, there has to be one dingleberry who insists on inviting in the very people you have left the regular chat over?  If I wanted to talk to these bozos, I'd stay in the regular AOL chatroom.  I want to avoid their stupidity, small mindedness, attention whoring, whatever...and BLAMMO there it is, in a room that was supposed to be "secret".  Now they know the link and we can never use that room for privacy again.  Nothing said in these private rooms is X rated, there is no cybering or anything, just talking to friends without the drama and idiocy of these teenagers and others with the IQ of dryer lint.  I don't hang around with people like that offline, why should I be subjected to their drooling rants online?  I got an AOL account to surf the web and chat with like minded folks....not Special Olympians.  And I am not dissing people with real mental defects.  I have a few online friends who are "slow" or even borderline mentally handicapped, but they don't annoy me.  The ones that annoy me are the "HEY WASSUP?" "Any fine hoes in diz hizzhouse?"  "What size bra do you wear?" morons.  I am also so sick of the teenagers who think AOL is their domain.  Sorry, it's actually an adult forum.  Paid for by adults.  I get so pissed when some 15 year old types, "You are too old to be in here."  Oh really?  You have your own credit card to pay your own AOL?  I know I do.  I fear for this generation of idiots.  Soon we'll all be knee deep in drool.

      Anyone who has had to share a computer with someone can share my frustrations.  I love my boyfriend, but sharing a computer with someone, even someone that you love, is definitely an exercise in....oh, let's say an exercise in not smothing someone to death in their sleep with a pillow.  Point in case, I work at home, so I do try to get off the computer in the evening/night/weekend so that he can enjoy surfing, chatting, etc.  Instead he will spend most of his online time downloading something...music, a game, whatever.  Then we will be infected with five dozen different viruses and he'll deny downloading anything that might have caused it.  Unless the virus came from a government website, the local newspaper website, or an email from Betty Crocker, Nestle, or General Mills, I don't think it came from anything I've done.  Then later that night I may be fortunate enough to catch some friends online.  Someone might even start a little private chatroom that we all go to.  Now, if HE was online, and they invited him in, he wouldn't go.  But if I'm on and in there, he wants to read over my shoulder, comment, and if I go get drink or, god forbid, go to the bathroom he'll actually get on and start typing in the chatroom.  He did this last night, so I finally just signed off and let him on.  I don't know if he went back to that chatroom, I just covered up on the couch and went to sleep.  Now, I know he is going to read this get he'll probably get that all pouty voice and say "I didn't mean to (insert whatever)."  And I know that.  I know that he doesn't sit in a chair next to me, groping me, pulling my hair, and making all types of sexual references and gestures on purpose.  He isn't trying to get my attention away from the screen when he pulls on my clothes, tickles me, or tries to pull my pants down.  ("I'm just kidding with you.")  I just wonder how he'd view my "kidding" if I anally assaulted him with a cucumber while he was downloading yet ANOTHER Psychopathic rap artist or ANOTHER video game ROM, or whatever.  Which is why I say, bludgeoning someone to death with a blunt instrument is, indeed, an act of love.  And honey, I'm just kidding with ya.  I love you.

      As a daycare provider, I get to see a side of life many people don't get to see or choose to overlook.  The seedy underbelly of "the moronic state of children today."  And before you think "Oh, all OLD people feel that way about kids." let me just say NO.  Let me cite some examples.  Last fall/winter I had five kids in my daycare home.  Their ages were 9 8, 7, and two 5 year olds.  At first I was really excited, I foresaw aftersch0ol games of Boggle and Scrabble, Monopoly tournaments, reading, etc.  Boy was I in for a reality check.  None of them knew how to play one game.  Not one.  They didn't even grasp the game "Concentration."  You know, where you put cards face down, pick two randomly, and try to maych them.  I even had Pokemon Memory, same thing with Pokemon characters on cards, and not even the 9 year old could "get it."  What the FUCK is there to GET?  You turn over two cards, remember what is on them, and try to find two the same?  The front of the box says "Ages 4 through 8."  I guess I got spoiled because my own two children, now grown, were actually able to "get" games.  By the time they were 5, they were playing Skip Bo and Uno and Monopoly.  And not "babified" versions either.  My mom taught them cards, and she was not a merciful teacher.  You either learned it right or didn't play, period.  So I guess I just don't "get" how a kid who is going into middle school in a year and a half can't figure out how to play Pokemon Memory or Mickey Mouse Yahtzee.  They begged me to play Mouse Trap, remember that game?  You set up this elaborate mouse trap and try to catch you opponent's mice under the big net at the end?  I told them I wasn't going to sit there and do it all for them.  They all reassured me that they had played Mouse Trap on many occasions and knew how to do it.  Liars.  All the board games eventually went up on a really high shelf and I brought out the video games.  They really didn't "get" a lot of them either, but at least the bright lights and sounds shut them up for a while.

      I have posted and deleted at least half a dozen entries so far in this blog.  This one is staying, I guess, no matter how lame or whiny or self-indulgent that seems.  Isn't a blog sort of self-indulgent anyway?  Why would I think anything in my life could possibly be of any interest to any other person in the entire world?  So...here I go.  Who I am, what I want, what I do...this is as hard as when my boss at work asked us to all write our out goals and how we are going to attain them.  My goal at that time was to get the Hell out of that place.  I just wrote down that I wanted to be debt free.  I didn't want a confrontation.  Just roll over, take it up the poopoo shoot without Vaseline, and smile.  Be nice.  Try to help others.  Seems the more I do that stuff, the more Vaseline I need.  I just want someone to be kind to me.  To talk kindly, to put me first, to care what I think or feel or want.  Not ask me, and do whatever the hell they want anyway, but to actually take into account what I say, think, or feel and make it matter.  Most of the time I feel like the only thing that matters about me to anyone is what I can do for them.  Babysit for free or cheap.  "Loan" them money I know I'll never see again.  Pay their bills.  Be their cheerleader.  I'd like a cheerleader of my own, someone to really share things.  Someone to share the bad stuff, not just the good.  Someone who doubles the joy and halves the sorrow...gag, yeah.  You know, what you want and what you get aren't the same thing most of the time.  I guess, all in all, I just want to matter.  I want my existance to matter.  There was a man here in town that most everyone in town knew of.  He died.  Nobody went to his funeral.  Not one person.  Not ONE PERSON!!  I don't want that to be me.
