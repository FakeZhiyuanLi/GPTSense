       \/\/ell, I'm out of my first year in high school.  I didn't take any hard classes as a freshman though. here's my grades from the classes I had Health-       A Photography-  B- Physical Ed.- A+ Science-      B English 9-    A- Algebra 1-    A See, they weren't that hard, and I frankly did little homework.  I still worked hard though, before I didn't do ANYTHING and I was a D student, but now I feel like I did much better.  Next years is going to be harder too, and I'll have less time because I'm joining more curricular activities. I allready know my schedule (well not the order my classes are going to be in, but I know what classes I'm taken)  Us History Biology Geometry physical Ed 11 French 1 English 10  Then I formed a sport for extra curricular activity so I have a sport for every season. At the beginning of school I'll take Cross Country when Cross Country is over then winter will be here and I'll be taking Nordic Ski-Cross Country then when that is over I'll be taking Track (like I took this year)  Well other than that my freshman year is over and in a couple of months I'll be starting school as a sophmore (yikes!!!).  My first week for the summer I jogged like 10 miles a day and visited my grandma at my dads house and did a few piano recital's. Which reminds me I should go practice piano. (I'll do that right when I'm done typing in this blog) Then my second week for this summer I wanted to help daddy, so I removed all these sticks from the backyard which took ALL DAY!  I dragged tons of heavy logs that were twice my size and you bet I developed some arm muscle from that!  Well I also developed something else from the logs.  POISON OAK (T_______T) it's pretty bad too.  It's all over my body, yes even on my chest! The worst part is it's on my chest and my right side of my face. On my right side of my face it's swollen up and red and bubbly, and oh it's horrible.  I'm too scared too go outside and do my four mile jog (since I'm at my dads house I have not much places to jog too) but since I get beeps from jogging without poison oak on my face, I don't even want to know peoples reactions when they see a girl jogging which looks like a big red bubbly faced mutant.  They probably do something worse than honking I'll tell you that. (T____T) so I'm not going out in public or jogging. I might as well just do my power work outs like-1000 crunchies, and 100 leg lifts.  That'll work (T____T) but it's not the same.     Most the time I'm either playing DDR Max 2 or DDR Max 1, working on heavy mode, to pass the time. That even annoys my grandma and aunt, so I'm usually hesitant to play it, but HEY! I can't stay on the computer all day, can I?      I should also shower, I'm all icky (as you need to know, I'm so sure).  I might as well aisle do a couple of my fanfics here, that'll work ^^! (gosh) I just realized, I wonder what Don (my piano teacher) is going to think when he sees me this all poison oaky and stuff. Today I got yelled at by my dad and aunt because I'm not eating right.  I'm only eating at lunch, but when I eat lunch I totally binge.  Like yesterday I had 2 nectarine, 2 peaches, 3 handful of grapes, 1 sandwich (with cheese/meat/mustard/jelly), 2 bowls of oats (it's actually good, I think I developed a taste for it). Yeah, I totally binge. That's like four meals in one, which leads me full for the rest of the day. I'm not really into the snacking on little meals every two hours, which my mom does because she joined this thing called 'Curves' which tells you to do that to help maintain your metabolism and yadda yadda yadda to help you lose weight. I already know what I'm going to do today I'm going to A-take a shower B-Practice Piano for a while C-Play DDR MAX and DDR MAX2  D-Do Crunchies and leg lifts E-Brush My teeth and hair *of course* F-Have Dinner (I'll just not eat anything till dinner) G-Go on the internet and do my live journal H-Go To Bed  Interesting, right?

       Well nothing new to say, I still got bad poison oak but the swelling went down. In fact, the only swelling happens to be part of my cheek and my ear.  Other than that it's all good.  OH! I had a heroic dream last night. It was about I'll just start at the beginning.    It was at my moms house and I guess she was hosting a party or something because a lot of people were there.  I mean, a lot!  I'll list the people. A fat lady--she was black skin and she was very nice to talk too.  She was enjoying the punch at the party.  The Phipps--all of the Phipps it seems from Dallon, john, Ammon, Laura, (oh Barbara wasn't there, probably still off in college), Aaron, Sarah, Don, Jason, (Jessica wasn't there either, perhaps she was at her house which seems miles away), Mrs. Phipps, and Mr. Phipps were there included---they were all enjoying their time too (odd everyone seems to be enjoying their time at my MOMS house).  There was also Sabrina and her parents their (mom and dad).  Jessalyn and her dad (I wonder why she's at my moms house, I actually wonder why she's even at my house).  Tabitha was there but her dad wasn't so I guess she came with Sabby same with Tiffany.  There was this banker too (which I'm guessing is my moms new boyfriend).  Plus a lot of kids ( I mean A LOT)tons of little kids, I guess this was a party for the little kids, because there was a lot, I guess a baby-sitting-party.  Weird.   Well anyway the little kids I suppose had parents too but they weren't there I guess it was a babysitting party, and well everyone was having fun talking.  The fat black skin woman was the funniest one I remember in my dream, she actually cracked out some jokes. Then we heard a loud bang and we were all outside in the backyard. I was with Dallon (a three year old) and talking with him while walking.  He was talking about a pokemon adventure or something like he always does.   Well we all heard the loud bang so I let Dallon play with a flower while I go and see what the heck it was, everyone stopped talking and in a few seconds Sabrina comes running full speed in the house screaming, "TIGERS ARE IN THE FRONT YARD" and we instantly hear a "RAWRRRRR" which made everyone scream and run in the front yard.  I ran back to get Dallon and picked him up (oof he's heavy) and ran straight indoors too.  We all looked in our front window to the front yard and saw our front yard was packed with tigers and they were chewing on the banker... (not a pretty site).  Everyone was basically screaming or the little kids were crying.   That's when I realized our screams and crying was a bit too loud, in fact it was attracting the tigers they were looking at the window and one actually pawed at it! So I realized something, and locked the door/windows/everything!!! Everyone was in a panic.  Sarah looked around too and yelled out at everyone, "You all need to be quiet, the Tigers hear us, nobody make a sound." which we all did.   Then I grabbed the phone and dialed 9-1-1 and exclaimed to them that there was tigers out front of my yard and they started laughing so I gave the phone to everyone in the room, and in the end believe me, they believed me and asked us if we could get out of the house in any safe way possible? And I went, "No-there's no safe place" then they say, "we'll be right there with help." and I'm all, "I hope to god so!" (sorry for saying Gods name in vain in front of you Laura and Mrs.  Phipps..And why am I apologizing .. I didn't apologize in the dream >   Well so I put the phone down and say, "they're coming, meanwhile we all have to be quiet like Sarah said." so we all were then we heard a car come up. We looked out the front window and saw it was moms car (oh yeah, I didn't mention she wasn't at the party).  She opened the car and walked out as if not seeing the cars. that's when I opened window and screamed at mom to get back in the car, which she instantly did...but this attracted a tiger and it swiped at me.. I closed the window just in time.   Well mom drove the car in the garage and then she ran too the back door (this is brave of her, I'm amazed) and unlocked the back door with her key and came in and said, "what the f**** is going on" (Mrs. phipps and the rest of the phipps didn't seem to mind this because they were all pretty scared.) I went, "I don't know mom" but ding-a-ling-ling I had an Idea.  I then told her, "Mom I need you to do me a favor." and I started whispering in her ear.  When I was done whispering in her ear, mom nodded (this is like the best we ever got along).   Well, I then stood on our kitchen table and said in a calm voice, "everybody listen up!  When I dialed 9-1-1, they said to leave the house in any safe way possible. Which we are going to do.  First I want all the little kids to go with mom first.  Now everyone bring the little kids foreward.  I want each parent to memorize three kids.  (their was only ten kids total).  Well all the ten kids stepped foreward and there I grabbed five kids and went, "okay none of you can talk when you leave the back door." and one little girl went, "your going to feed us to the tigers?" and I went, "nonono.. I'm saving you from the tigers, unless you want to be tiger food you have to be very quiet.  When you reach a car I want you all to get into the car, I don't care how much little room there is either. None of you can complain. (these kids were all around the age of five or six so they understood me) I also want you kids to try not to cry. Your all going to safety." then mom and the kids left the back door and went to the garage and mom opened the door and all the kids climbed in with one in the front. Mom hit the pedal and they were out of the garage.   "Okay now we all need to wait till mom comes back. WE all should be very quiet" I said and then I sat down and sighed. Then the black lady (i don't know what her problem was) opened up her cell phone and started whispering in it, and everyone over heard, "hey nancy... What up? well... hear me on this, I'm gonna die today.  I'm gonna die today just Like I foresighted. There's Tigers out in the front, yeah that right Tigers. This is so exciting I'm gonna die" I was thinking in my head 'oh no your not'. but you know I bet everyone felt like they were gonna die. Well we waited a while then we saw the car come up the driveway from the front window. That's where I grabbed the rest of the five kids and then I looked over at the rest of the crowd. "Laura, Sarah" they both looked up and I beckoned them to come step over to me.   When they did I told them that they were going with the kids and that they had to be careful and watch over them and that my mom isn't entering this building she's staying in the car. When they both nodded in understandment they lead the kids out the back door and I guess they were safely in the car because the car left the building.   We waited again for a while and this time the car came back where I then beckoned Aaron to come foreward, Sabby, Tabby, Tiff, and Jessalyn. They all went through the back door. and they made it safely through.  Well I guess we were waiting but while mom was driving with aaron, Sabby, Tabby, Tiff, and Jessalyn.  A cop came and pulled mom to the side of the road for speeding and driving with too many people in the vehicle. That's where they all explained Tigers were taking over and they were leaving the building. The cop didn't believe and told him to show him if it was true and so mom had to drive back with everyone and when the cop saw this his exclamation was, "holy mother of God"  Mom drove away and the cop guy pulled up in the garage and took out a gun where he entered the back door where I jumped up and went, "9-1-1 people?" and he went, "no that aint me."  then I blinked and went, "who you?" and he went, "just a cop ready to help you people" and I nodded and told him that he could help by also being a transportation. He also nodded and here I gathered Mr. Phipps, Mrs. Phipps, Jessalyns dad, Jason, Don, and Jasons girlfriend.  They all packed themselves into the cops car and left, but before they left Mrs. Phipps grabbed ahold of me and said, "I can't go, I didn't see Dallon leave with the kids and there was eleven kids total at the party" I blinked and went, "GO I'll make sure we don't leave without him" and Mrs. Phipps believed me and left.   Where mom came by and I ecsorted sabbys mom and dad out and helped them in the car because they are a bit (on the heavy side when it comes to weight, no offense).  Then I went back inside where the black lady was lauging her head off. I looked at her and went, "what's so funny?" she then say, "look they scratching at your front door!" I looked over and sure enough the Tigers were banging at the front door. I kind of gulped. and went, "that's not funny".  She laughed and say it was. OH there was something I forgot to add. well a lot of things (hey dreams are hard to remember). Back when the kids were loading the tigers were banging on the door, so I made the black lady sit down and guard the door for she weighed like 400 pounds and she was pleased to do it too, so don't say I put the black people first cuz I don't! I love black people... even if they don't love me.     What I also didn't mention was that the Tigers every time everyone went to the back door, I would distract them by going to the window and hollering at them, this was very scary to do.    Well the tigers were very well enough scratching at the front door, and they were getting through. Thank God the police man came and then mom, I told the black lady to go with mom. The police man I told him to stay. Well the black lady went with mom and then the police man asked him why I told him to stay.      That's when I told him he had a gun and could help me search the house for Dallon, well we searched and couldn't find him, that's when I looked from my moms room screen door and saw Dallon right there being bitten by a baby Tiger. There I grabbed the police mans sleeve and we both went out moms back screen door from her room where I kicked the baby tiger and grabbed screaming Dallon.  This however made the baby tiger scream. I just said this to the cop, "run" which we did. We ran straight for the police car.   Where I guess the tigers scratched through because right when I got to the car door I saw a tiger crash into the back door from the inside of the house. I was hypervhenilating and Dallon was crying his head off.  When I put Dallon to the side I pulled off some of my pants cotton and put it around Dallons arm (where the baby tiger took a bite).  The police man got the car out and we were both heading away when we saw some cop cars coming up, "oh finally they come." I say so I tell the cop to go up to another cop car. So he does and we roll the windows down and I tell them that I exited all the people out and they just need to get rid of the tigers where they tell us back that they have people from the zoo coming.   Then while we were just about to leave the block I tell the cop guy to turn around and he ask why? and I go, "we forgot about the neighbors" the cop understands at once and drives back to the neightbor where I run over to the neighbor and tell them to call everyone at the block (for they know everyones number) which they did and told them to evacute their houses. Where I gave them directions to go to (the Phipps house, it's close by but far away from the Tigers)" So next thing you hear is people sneaking out to their cars with their children slamming the doors and leaving, with tigers rawring and people from the zoo trying to capture them.      Then I grabbed the cops sleeve and went, "let's go" Dallon was still in the car.  Well the cop was driving to the phipps house when I told him we shouldn't go there, we should go straight to the hospital. Which we did.   When we got to the hospital I stayed with Dallon while they were giving him immediate aid, the cut was deep, and I also spoke to the cop. went something like this.  "thank you so much, you don't know how much you helped" (me) "you helped some too you know" (cop) "na'ah, but if it wasn't for you everyone here would have to wait longer and seeing that door bust down.. we made it just in time, tahnks to you. You should be rewarded or something" (me) "if it wasnt' for you everyone would be dead, your neighbors would be still in their house, and dallon would be worse than harmed from that baby tiger" (cop) "wow" (me) "yes, wow indeed" (cop) then I started talking about his job and how was it and paper work and then I asked about his age "how old are you? you like you are in your twenties" (me) "I'm twenty straight up" (cop) "arn't cops supposed to be in their thirties and fourties and fat and not good looking?" (me) "now your being steorotype" (cop) -=laughter=- "sorry" (me) "no problem" (cop is laughing too) So then it's like midnight and Dallon has a broken arm and thirteen stitches. So I pick Dallon up and carry him to the cop car where he drives us to the Phipps house. Later on all the tigers have left and everyone went back to their house. The cop looked at me and said this, "next time it'll be bears" and he kissed me on the forehead and left that was my dream.... Well today will be a normal day as usual.
