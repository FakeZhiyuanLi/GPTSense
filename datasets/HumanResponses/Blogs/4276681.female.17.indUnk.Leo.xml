      I  have this very good friend of mine, who have stood by me through out all this while, this is something that he sent to me, i was rather shaken by this msg. wELL, this msg sort of like reminded me that, hey life is actualli einfach. and all this while, i was the one being complicated.. Here it goes.     look into the mirror...and ask yourself.. who's the person who was there for you when u needed someone? who's the person who has laughed with you when you are happy...and to shed tears with you when u r sad? who's the person who was there all your life...and never to abandon you even when everyone esle does? who's the person whom has loved you the most? look into the mirror and you have the answer... i might have not experienced love before... but i can tell u a few things abt it... love never hurts...not even after a breakup...if it does...it's just puppy love.... love does not hurt as it symbolizes joy and happiness...does it mean after a couple break up love is no longer there? no...it does not...love is forever... the concept of loving and liking is only a line apart..many confuse btw love and like... probably if you hurt a lot...it means u liked the person a lot.. if u love the person...you shld not be sad when breakup occurs...dissapointed maybe...but never sad..coz even when u are apart...your care and concern will never change... many ppl feel sad when they break up is because of a sudden lost in the sense of direction in life... many things change...no one is there for you anymore...no one does sweet things for you anymore...no one provides you with a shoulder to lean on anyone... people do not miss the person...but people miss the feeling of being with the person... truth is..i went thru it when i broke up with my gf...i miss her a lot...not literally the person..but the feeling of being with someone...and this is especially strong when i am alone... i can tell you what love is... love is when you quarrel evreyday with the person...yet you still care for him or her the 1st day u were together.... love is when that person does nasty things to you...yet you still say that people do make mistakes and the person is forgivable... love is when you believe in the person so strong...that nothing will change that believe of you... love is when you still stay strong in a 30 yr marriage that was a total torture to you...  i've seen worst cases of breakups...i have people trying to jump of buildings, slice themselves...but eventually...they remained strong and managed to move on...and a few years down the road we'd be laughin over the silly things they did for wad they believed to be love... "hey, 2 yrs ago today i was crying so badly over him, i remember what happened...but i've made it though.." and imagine this, both of us...having coffee at Starbucks, and you saying that...wldnt that be a wonderful day to look forward to? the day when u truly move on and tell yourself that living in the past is something useless becoz of the future we have to look forward to? some people think too much about their past, while some worry to much about their future, that they forget they are living in the present...   He was right about me, i have been holding on for too long, too long... i will continue with my Einfach story, well, i still dunno for wad reasons..       Einfach~simple

       Einfach.. Her life was once ordinary, simple and uncomplicated. She was one of the happiest gals ever on earth. She was born with a weak heart, the doctor said, the only way for her to live long enough is to indulge in happiness every day. ya.. she led a very happy life for the past 16 years.        the story of  him and her..         They met in loners planet, she looked at him and thought: he looks so lonely.. She didnt noe his name. so she gave him a name, called stark ( strong). strong on the outside, soft in the inside. they became friends, not very close friends but not exactly like strangers. She never knew his name, he never knew hers. And he went away, faraway. She never knew where he went, why he went.. She never gave it a thought, it was einfach. it was just an ordinary friendship.       But, she knew something was not rite, her heart was reacting differently for the first time in her life, so different, she thought it was spoilt.  She saw the doctor, but he said she was fine. She never knew what it was. She didnt thought much abt it, she just live her life like every day. Not until one day, several years later, she saw him again...      In the same place he went away.. she saw him...again...    Einfach~simple

       Many of you who are reading my blog would find the story of einfach somehow related to me. Yes, it is another version of my story.It's a story that i want people to noe, to let all of you know that falling in love, finding the one to love is actually a very simple, einfach thing. So simple, beautiful that it's unbelieveable that love can actually be simple..      I have many friends who have relationship problems. some chose to seal it up, to shut it out of their lives, some still dun noe what to do about it, they dunno how to get out of that trap, they dunno what they want. and they juz seem to be trapped in the same thing. For these people, their greatest pain is that they cant forget the ones they once loved, and this pain, continues to erode their heart.       I belong to all that three characters. some part of me wans to shut it out, some parts of me wans to hold on. But the result is juz more hurt and more pain for me. that is why i wrote einfach.. to let my feelings flow and to let this story remind everyone i noe, that letting it go is very painful, but knowing that you have loved someone before is actualli, one on the best things in life. so dun b afraid to fall in love, to fall out of love because love is juz an einfach thing..       einfach~simple

       on this fateful day, many years ago..she met someone who changed her life completely. I s this a love story? i dunno. Maybe it will be, maybe it will not... But ever since then, she knew that her life is no longer the same.      Many years ago, in this place call the loners planet. she saw this guy, not very good looking, not very attractive. But she found him special. Special in a way that she found him a special place in her heart. She was young, she just simply took him as a friend. Never thought further. It was simple, it was einfach.      But today, it was different. He no longer occupies that special place but most of her heart. It was complicated.    That simple feeling was gone. She thought she could be friends with him, she thought by thinking nothing of him, wishing nothing, that place in her heart would go. and she will be einfach again. BUt the connections between them, pulled her back everytime she wanted to go. Friends? She doubts. Future? unclear. einfach no more?      Einfach~Simple

        the story of Einfach.  This is a story of a gal name Einfach.      A story on wad she did, learnt and felt throughout her life.   She has this dream, a dream to spread hope and love. But she doubts she can do it.      How is she going to do it? She doesnt know. All that she knows is that all she wants is    " A Simple life". No pain, no swearing, no hurt, no war, no nothing...........         Einfach~simple
