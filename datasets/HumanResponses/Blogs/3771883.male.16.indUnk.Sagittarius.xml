      ugh conflict. there are things pulling me in every direction, im jealous in a way but im not stressing, which is strange, instead, i feel this kind of giddy, bubly, strange feeling, and its only just now come to pass. this relationship i have blasted into is wonderful but its hurting people at the same time and that pains me.  this reminds me of a book i read, lol actually it was brave heart, when the horses are pulling him apart? that was intense. i dont know how to spell intence. see i just spelled it two different ways and they both look wrong.  i like it late at night, i get all numb and  jacked up at the same time, i am plauged with contradictions when it gets late and i love thinking about them, but my mind is moving too fast and i feel stupid and slow trying to type.  i think i should just scan my journal.  blah i feel so random lately. its worth it.

      i really dont think my mom sees me as a person. i dont want to sound like those people who spout how much they hate their arse rag parents, i really love my mom a lot, and i never lie to her, but in my life there are things i really have to hide from her, something im sure everyone does... however i really wish it wasnt a must, i dont understand if my mom thinks that im just supposed to magically have all the knowledge and experience i need for living when i leave the house, or when im 18 or what... if she thinks there is some rite of passage one goes through when they move away that allows them to make "good choices" and hang out with the respectable, upstanding, good graded, good talking (hehe) fuckwits that every parent wants thier darling little children to run about with and frollick in a nice sunny buble, blah i dont want to be bitter about it, but when she insults my friends i get really really pissed off, she can talk shit to me all she wants, but to talk about my friends that she doesnt even know is unbelievable, i was under the impression that i was to grow up respecting people for who they were, not how they look, and what they do in their free time, i was taught to judge to determine whether they were good people at heart.  the people i have chosen to surround myself with are good people, ive made a lot of really great new friends, that i really respect a lot, and when my mom rips into them after digging into their school files (a few of them anyway, she can do that she is a principal) or calls them fucked  up druggies because there was a party with booze or pot i just lose respect for her, and i feel pushed away, pardon the cliche... and the rhyme... damnit i lost my anger, lol stupid rhyme it stole my good angry flow, one more thing to bitch about, my mom called me a fairy freak because i was wearing eye liner, oh and she found out i wore a skirt...(different story) and so now she thinks im trans-sexual, so yeah im her twisted fairy freak trans-sexual crank user son, how fun. on a better note my jennifer situation has blissfuly been resolved and we're both happy and it couldnt have happened in a more sweet and endearing way... lets just hope i can find some sort of balance with my  mom shit and my friend bliss, though at the moment i must say i dont mind all that much.

      bleh ive been so tired lately, i dont know why, my mild insomnia took a crap on my face after i got back from germany, my clock (internal) is messed up in a way i dont like, im supposed to be up into the late hours of the night pondering my existance, and right now all i can ponder is where the hell i left my shoes and how nice a pillow and or bed sounds.  sigh, i think i just need to wait it out and... ugh, go to bed.     i wish that people didnt need to talk, that emotion and expression could just be shared on a deeper level than the brain. none of us would have to deal with deception or mixed vibes or... idk of course there would still be mixed vibes, there isnt a way around it, i just really really wish there was, things are so simple for me in terms of whats going on in me... well at least most of the time, but if people could just feel whats going on in my heart, there wouldnt be need for second gussing or... i really dont know im not speaking about anyone in particular, any one who knows my situation wont believe that but im really not, im just feeling frustrated we cant REALLY say what we mean to eachother, there is always room for the words to come out wrong or a chance of saying the wrong thing... if people could just show each other what was really going on in their soul, what was down in their heart, i really honestly believe there would be a lot less confusion in relationships, if people could give more than thier word in a promise, a real testiment of what it is they are truly feeling... it would be so perfect.  at least for me i suppose.    ive been so tired lately, the nights have been so bleak.

      yes despite the odds i had a really good time last night, it was so much fun!  i was at first going out of duty to my friends, i was expecting there would be the suprise and then we would just... sit, and do nothing all night.  but i was willing to do that, my friends are important, those 2 are all thats left from middle school, and im not one to be opposed to new people, ont he contrary, i love new people, but its good to have people to know what you've gone through for the years, no need to introduce, no ice breaking, the good ol' familiar.    so moving on, for the first half hour or so, we... sat and did nothing (big suprise to me you can be sure) but then we went in and dans mom proposed we go see a good friend of hers, his name is forest, he is an old (well, 40's old) eccentric gay man who is QUITE funny, they all drank and carried on, stories of his youth, god he was funny, and then i drove back (dans mom was a lil tipsy... i love mary-anne) and forest came back too, it was maybe 2:00 am when we got back and we put on some music, oldies and new stuff, van morrison and tool, radiohead and the beachboys, it was so fun, my oldest of friends jake got drunk for his first time, and had his first cigg, and he has discovered that not all that is illegal is a bad thing!! ah he knew this before but he is one to cling to something for the sole reason of clinging, which is fine, i cling aplenty, i suppose its just the things we cling to are... subtly different.  forest left at approx 3:30 am and after he left i was able to resolve the majority of my conflicted feeling the the day prior to night festivities.  resloved-ness, i love it.  so things are back to their norm, or as norm as it can be for a while, but i must say im happy, and im gonna try to hold onto this when my next.... bout, comes 'round.  im sure it'll be all good.

      how could 2 grand events clash with such a mighty force as they are tonight?  My good friends 17th b-day suprise party and an awesome concert with a person i absolutely love to be around... all on a friday night.  i went with the b-day party.  sigh.  it was so hard and i can never express what is going on in my head when i have to choose like this, because nobody really expects me to do anything with them, but they cant help hurting when i dont.  and this is the last thing i want.  words that have been spoken are true, no one is forcing me to sit down with them and chill, who i choose to be with is my choice and mine alone, and its so easy for me to create little worlds where i just exist in a happy delerium with a person i would never want to leave my side.  I wonder, no im confident that i would feel just as shity if i chose to go to the concert, so.... ugh i dont know.  i hope you have fun jennifer.

      i was on music piracy application the other day and i illegaly downloaded some songs from an old video game i used to play: The Legend of Dragoon, it was a marvelous video game, full of action with a compelling story of valor, honor, and most of all, an all consuming love.  im listening to the main theme right now in fact, and all these powerful emotions that had been evoked from the video game are rushing in, mingling with my already present emotions of... well i dont know.  It makes for a powerful combo, i must say.  I think its sad that video games have so much appeal over reality, i understand why, in video games... its just better, even if you die in the end at least its for your lost love from another galaxy or to save the planet from destruction... you never see the main charector in a video game getting lung cancer or aids, to perish a slow meaningless death, or getting blown down in a drive by... its always either valliant or natural, spent with the one you love and all the booty (as in treasure) from your adventures handed down to your plethora of children, to your newfound kingdom (you were a bastard child of an evil ruler returned to take what was rightfully yours) It's all so romantic and brilliant, and here i am, looking for a job. hoping my love life turns out right.  i can see it now  "the worlds best new video game" 36 levels of action packed job hunting, new features including getting depressed and feeling hopeless!! "play through the eyes of valdor the great as he tries to figure out what the hell is gonna happen with xandra the beautiful, his mysterious mystress with a past SO elusive, that he can only ponder what it contains..."   OR, play online with other jobless heroes, where the new livechat feature allows you to have realtime convos with other players all over the world.  how fun.  i dont really know what to say now... i guess i just want things to go in the direction i want for once, i dont have a reset button so im just gonna do my best to get a high score on my first, and only, time.

      this heat is oppresive, i thought germany was hot, this is unbearable, my usual disposition to clothes has escalated into something that will soon grow to be possibly public offensive if this damndable heat  continues.  im not gonna get my job back, there are reasons; budget crap and new policy B.S.  but the fact remains that i am now without a source of income.  400 dollars in the bank and 500 untouchable dollars in savings is all i have to my name... and 400 dollars is good, but i dont like my money dwindling without it growing again, and i have a feeling it will dwindle quite quickly without a job.  so... looking for a job with a subtle cloud of dissapointment looming over my shoulder, i hope this gloomy shroud doesnt creep into other potential possibilities in my life.  whereas my job situation at the moment is rather dismal, other aspects of my life seem to be going rather well... and i would be quite pleased if they were to stay that way. i always seem to have hope, and this is good.

      jeez just went to raley's after 3 weeks of gone-ness and there was a crew working that i didnt get along with at best on the job there and there were bad vibes to put it mildly at my perusing, but perhaps its just my paranoia.  i guess i didnt think about how i might actually have to work a lil to get my job BACK once i came home from germany, i really need tot alk to the guy that hired me: sam parcher.  he's a cool guy, he liked me, he'll hook me up with my job again.. i hope.  i have a shot glass for him from germany, maybe that'll help a lil bit... sigh. i really hope i get my job back.

      back form germany, things are still in limbo, but its pleasant.  to be honest, things couldnt be better, and if they could they will be soon.  listening to "broken" by amy lee and seether man and i like it.  makes me feel good, because they sound sad and as opposed tomy usual detriment of joy when listening to such songs i still feel... grand.  im home, people are lovely, my, situation with jenn is a lil more under control, but i have a feeling things will be fine, regardless of the decision, and im in love witht he world... corny true but im in a good place, my life is a good color right now, things are just flying around and im just livin it and again its grand.  i would change a thing with my life.  i could always want more freedom and whatnot but its just my mom caring so bleh, i can deal with it and smile.    smile.

      ciggareten and gay pride, with z and y reversed on the key board.  these are my profound new looks at germany. im having fun, but i miss jennifer like mad, and whats the worst is our departure the morning b4 i left, that was reallz...unfortunate. not because i got in trouble, actuallz i didnt get in that much trouble, mz mom is joking about it and stuff, kinda cool i guess. i just think its horrible how she has to worrz about mz mom hating her now, which isnt true.  the truth is, mz mom hates everz girl i meet till i dont like her anzmore, it pisses me off how she keeps throwing shit about jenelle in mz face.  "jenelle didnt do this" and "i never saw jenelle leave those on zour neck" grrr, but its cool, she'll come around, and if she doesnt, she'll just have to deal with it, because i reallz dont want anzthing to change between jennifer and i.  i dont  have her e-mail.  in fact, i dont havce anzones e-mail that i want to talk to. i reallz want to talk to wei, and i reallz want to talk to jennifer, and i have neither one of their e-mails.... sigh.  im realz not in the mood to do this right now, but at the same time i reallz am, i think the z and y being switched is reallz disrupting mz... flow. lol and i keep sighing. well, time is monez, and if bz anz freak chance either wei or jennifer read this, please leave me a comment with those e-mails... or e-mail me i guess...sigh.

      my life is a good colour. i feel like though not everything in my life is wonderful (poor me...)  things are going in a direction i can agree with and enjoy.  my family strife and other issues (actually there is just family strife...) seem petty now instead of aggrivating and arent as difficult to deal with.  I am surrounded with people who i respect and who respect me and i feel like i am just barely dipping into a world of people that will really help me grow into a person... the person, whatevr, that i want to be.  So thank you for being who you are, even you people who just come across this and post a comment, you dont understand how much i appreciate you.  mahal kita to the one who is closest, thank you for taking me for who i am and being consistant in your support and     warmth, without you i dont know where i would be, and im glad i can be where i am with a person like you to live life with.

      the only time i am ever up this early is... well actually im up this early quite often, i  just want a dramatic hook to illustrate that i have been up for many hours with no or little rest.   i made a photo album, but the pictures are to big to put in my profile and i dont understand url enough to put them in here, so ja... http://photobucket.com/albums/v311/bandnerd9000/   there are cool pictures my cousin took in L.A in there, he took them and i edited them in photoshop, some pretty cool effects i guess.    my life is goood, im too tired to put it all poetically like i usually like to do, ar at least try to do, but yeah things are happy with me, at least most of it is, still i ssues with my madre but what's new with that? it doesnt bring me down, well, it doesnt bring me down right now... maybe this is de to the fact that i'm miles away from her...  so my dad is in town, havent seen him in a long time.... i wonder how it'll be?   i feel good.

      a wonderful night to put it mildly, but this is a night to put things mildly, to leave things behind corners you cant wrap your tongue around, a night to leave ones brain spinning in circles, a blind dog chasing its tail on the freeway.  i hit every light green coming home, it flowed with my mind, green-fresh thoughts, consistant. They seemed vibrant in the black sky, the lights and my meandering brain, flowing from one to the next with an ease that hasn't dripped on my parched tongue in a long time.  so a dying man has found his water, and now what do i do?  just keep driving i guess, oh but the anticipation! the utter delight that no other cars are congesting my road, my smooth concrete. parallel to that, those persistant thoughts, equally smooth and just as heavy. heavy like a gallon of ice cream, vanilla pleasure, bitter vineger turned to chocolate in the blink of an eye... how did i miss it? ice cream like concrete; but wet now, it fills in the cracks and spaces, the ones you dont step on when you are small, wouldnt want to break your mothers back. the spaces in memory stretch and, grow dim? not dim, the opposite! this is a vivid trip down memory lane, but the clock is still ticking clockwise, im going forwards not backwards, my blind furry friend isnt running counter clockwise in his free way fiesta, no.  forward, towards a house with the porch light on, it shines.  brown glass, deep, dark, vibrant, glowing, shining, it shines, i told you, and i spoke true, it shines.  shine.

      yesterday was wonderful, went to the beach with jenn kat and john (i think his name was john...) all dresed up in nice clothes, jenn and kat in their prom clothes and john and i just... dressed up... yeah so it was cool, the weather was rather bizarre, it was really foggy but at the same time sunny. (as in the fog was ground level and up maybe 30 ft up and then it was blue sky with the sun beating down on us.) it was hot and we splashed around in the water a lil bit, then john left (wow i really hope thats his name...) and it got sunny (haha it was all his fault it was foggy) and ya. really chill.  then i got home and BOOM. UBER DEPRESSION MODE, like seriously, it was crazy, and nothing had really gone wrong during the day, and i had not been greeted at the front door with bitching.  strange to say the least. yeah and then another suprise: desperate to leave the house, i ask my mom at midnight if i can go to jakes house.... (an impossibility) and to my utter and complete suprise it was ok. this never happens then i got to jakes and it was all laughes, my bad mood completely gone. i dont understand but oh well, things are good, im happy.   ****i apologise if that was just... what i did that day. i dont like doing that... oh and no my title isnt related to my blog in anyway what so ever, it's not even an inside joke... i just... couldnt think of a "profound" or witty title****

      ah finally a day that was good through and through! chilled with jake, got to see jennifer, which was SO nice, and didnt have any badness to deal with when i got home, i have been happy all day, this i so marvelous.  haha right now im in a sort of happy delerium, im not used to so much joy, bleh im so corny... oh well. ahh she just makes me so bloody happy i cant stand it.  actually i can, heh and if i cant i suppose i could just sit down... (heh heh, get it? cant STAND it?... heh.. eh) so yes things are good, please please let them stay this way.  ~oh and pardon my horrible attempt at humor... it slips out sometimes~

      a precarious silence has befallen my humble abode... as long as i am PERFECT my mom will not explode. there is an almost unbearable tension, a springloaded landmine that could go off whether someone steps on it or not.  i dont care, im ready for this drama to be gone, and im almost curious as to what would happen if i were to THROW the shit in the fan instead of waiting... haha.  oh well, jenn is coming back today from camping so im exited about that and my mom is leaving all day so i am blessedly alone! ALL DAY!! this is wonderful, im gonna have jake over and we'll jam... (him on drums, me on piano, loads of fun)... oh that reminds me, my piano broke, the pedal on the far right doesnt sustain the notes anymore, it doesnt do anything anymore... this is quite sad. but oh well, im happy, in a very good mood, a wonderful way to start the day off if i cant say so myself, the prospect of swing dancing tonight is lovely, i havent been in ages, and Jenn seeing Jenn tonight would be absolutely wonderful...  so whether i see jenn or go swing dancing, my night is gonna be awesome, and my day is looking good as well.  i leave for L.A on wednesday (i HATE typing wednesday) and im really exited about that, leaving again kinda sucks, but it will be a much needed break from my mom, and i think my mom might even need this more than me... hahaha things are swell, as long as i can keep my focus and continue to look at the whole picture i should be fine.

      for a night owl, my nights have been quite shity lately, with the exeption of last night.  why is it i always have to come home to bitching?? i think it is unhealthy to want to flee a place you live in, and i want to flee desperatly. and having things be so splendid outside of home and in other aspects of my life doesnt help.... blah, i make myslef so bloody tense!! i do it all to myself, i know i do. its amusing, i really couldnt wish for things to be better, i mean things in friend zone are...brilliant, and i feel SO good around her, mmmm i love being a corny sentimental romantic "doofus"   im just letting things go.... not like work wise or responsibility wise, im just gonna let my life take me where i need to go, i dont want to wake up when im 30 and realise im in a place i dont want to be, im gonna book it with my school shit and keep up for bloody once, i want my mom off my back, and i want to do well on my own, again for once, see what i can really do without support... i guess i just want a lil room to breathe, room to make my own mistakes and learn from them. i want to live a life without a cushon to fall back on, a cushion that can at times be lined with nails.   AAH my life is scattered and collected, i feel like a big contradiction.   im happy though, through it all, and im pretty sure ill stay that way... this is the strangest thing... i get home happy, come upstairs, get online, get depressed and angry, and then it melloes out and i feel really good, for no apparent reason or for very obvious reasons, this is so strange.  i feel good.    **two minutes later**  mildly curious ponderings of blue brown eyes.... should feelings flashed for instants in distant chapters blur and slip away when chances were the author was distorted? a blind painter, a poet without imagination? one cannot make the ink wet again... reshape and manipulate what has already been written to suit present pretences... just turn the page man... chill.

      i mentioned earlier an experience i had with a skirt that got my mom all in a tiff, and i think it may have left me in a bit of a precarious position... im not trans-sexual, ill just get that out of the way right now... and though i can be rather feminine sometimes, im not gay either, i used to wonder if perhaps i was bi... but for the most part guys are pigs and though some are attractive, i wouldnt date them, it just seems off to me.  growing up with a lesbian mother has givin me a gift of open mindedness so i have absolutely nothing against gays lesbians bi or trans-gender/sexual people, but i guess it just isnt for me. however, i am open to new things, almost anything (i find it ironic i have been raised in such an open and alternitive home and yet i am being accosted for looks and womens clothes...hmmm) and i like close fitting clothes. so... eventually a time came where i had the, oppurtunity, to wear this really litle pink shirt that said "i kiss boys" in really glittery letters.  my friend liz and poppy bought it for me and so just for the hell of it i wore it to school one day.  i go to a pretty rockin school and so i didnt get any shit, and this shirt was small... like mid driff and just the whole deal, yeah some guys looked at me wierd, but i actually got s lot of compliments, and this started a chain reaction of sorts.  a few days later, another female friend of mine gave me yet another small pink shirt, and, again i wore it at school, same reaction pretty much, oh if you want to see what i look like, to try and imagine me in a pink shirt (who wouldnt want to imagine a guy in a small pink shirt??) there are pictures of me in an online photo album at: http://www.sonoma.edu/users/n/niemann/Travels/Travels.html  so anyway this pink tradition lasted for a few more shirts, and then it died. but now i, when the time came, would be ready for the next step. **bum bum bumm**   the next step came a few weeks later when i was hanging out with some friends of mine (and this kind of random guy that was a friend of my friend) and we all decided, (well me and wei decided) to dress me and n*** up in girl clothes and go to a local chill cafe and walk around and make idiots of ourselfs...(sounds like fun...eh?) so we did and we had a ball, it was like 10:00 pm so it was dark and stuff, it was just really cool and funny... lots of fun.  now about the skirt in the car my mom found, this was the first(and only) skirt i had ever worn, it was my friend liz's and she gave it to me as a gift, to remember and all that jazz.  so yeah i wore that to the cafe with my friends and had jenn hold onto it because i had to leave right when we got back ( i have an 11:00 pm curfew) and she had it at her house for weeks afterwards.  when she gave it back to me i left it in the car and my mom found it... of course she found it 2 days after our fight with the eyeliner, and so i walk in the door at 11:15 with eye liner on and my mom had this skirt... doesnt look to good. so its ok i guess, now she just sees me as a twisted trans-gender fairy freak crank user, its all good, im happy with who i am, its a lil ironic because im not really any of those things. oh well.  she'll get it some day. sorry this was so bloody long...

      i think its amazing how music can completely alter ones mood... last night i was listening to the requiem for a dream main theme, and though it is beautiful, it is quite sad, and i was depressed for the first time in a really long time last night, and, as opposed to carying over into the next day, (as my music listening tendancies usually do) i woke up this morning with the relazation that, i was really happy! no actually i just needed to practice the piano really bad because my piano teacher was going to be here in 20 minutes... but the song i was playing is just so beautiful, its a theme from amelie: Comptine D'un Autre Été: L'après Midi, and this song is georgeous, ah the whole amelie soundtrack, though musically challenging, is so beautiful i just cant stand it and it was at THIS point i realized that most of the depression i feel is rather self inflicted, sometimes inspired by depressing music, OR music that has bad connatations to it.  now, the requiem for a dream soundtrack has lovely connatations tied along with it but the song is just too damn sad to listen to as often as i was... with my sensitive psyche... it just wasnt a good thing for me to do, and it spoiled my wonderful afternoon, ah.. c'est la vie i suppose (my french speling is SO BAD) and its all good now i guess, im glad i feel better, last night was... haha rather dismal.  people were there for me though so thats enough to make anyone feel great regardless of self inflicted depression or otherwise, and im glad i have the people i do... thanks guys.  **sniff**
