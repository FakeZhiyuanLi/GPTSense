      Can someone tell me why Keanu Reeves is doing  urlLink ads for the Stanley Cup finals ?? Of all the guys they could have gotten, is he really the best one to make people want to watch hockey? The sport is floundering, people. The league might not exist next season. Is a spot featuring Bill (or was it Ted?) really going to sell a bunch of skeptical Americans on the fact that hockey is a legit sport and should be considered so? I realize that Keanu is Canadian, and as such, he commands a certain innate respect. But is he really the best Canadian for the job? Was Alanis Morrisette too busy? Were the Barenaked Ladies on tour or something?  urlLink Here's  a whole list of other people who could have done the job.   I think the next step is to get Trinity to do some spots for women's soccer.

      Holy crap, the midwest has some strange, Biblical, curl-up-into-a-ball-in-the-corner weather. The other night we had to call our ultimate frisbee game before it was over because we saw lightning (we were down 9-7 at the time). This was not unexpected. But walking to the car, the heavens opened up, and trying to drive home I couldn't see 10 feet in front of me, due to the sheets and sheets of rain pelting my windshield. The situation was made more complicated by the fact that one of my teammates was waiting for her boyfriend to show up, so we spent the next 45 minutes driving up and down the street next to this park, trying in vain to look for something that looked like his car, dodging tree branches and lakes in the middle of the road. Eventually we contacted him. He was at home. He tried to come to the game and gave up. Smart man.  And for the past week and a half, on all of the local TV stations there has been that little icon in the corner telling some of the viewing public that their area might be hit with a severe thunderstorm, flood, or tornado at any second. It's like code orange for weather.

      In the header of this blog, I promised Red Sox Rants...well, I promised a lot of things, including midwestern oddities, psychological phenomena, the joys and sorrows of higher education, and a whole lotta nothin', and so far all I've really delivered on is the latter part. But here I go, tackling the bohemoth (sp?) of the Sox. This is less of a rant and more of a pleasant appraisal of the state of affairs so far. Hey, they're in first, by a game and a half over the Yankees. Can't complain so far. They haven't completely lived up to all the expectations, but how could they?? It was the busiest, craziest, most active baseball offseason ever. They almost got A-Rod, but seriously -- who wants a guy with a phallace for a name? He's over-rated. Give me Nomahhhhh any day.   The other thing about the Sox so far is the Drama. The Sox this year are Drama. They are rock stars and they embrace that with everything they have. Just look at Johnny Damon. He looked like Jesus for the first third of the season, then shaved the beard in a charity event. Manny Ramirez just missed a road game to go to Miami to become a US citizen. Nomar is married to women's soccer star Mia Hamm. I think next Pedro Martinez should come out with a book. I don't know what about, but somehow that would seem appropriate. Maybe he could call it, "Throwing Down 75-Year-Old Men for Dummies".

      I forgot about the Beastie Boys. Seriously. I just sort of forgot that they existed. Sure, I still have two of their albums somewhere in my collection, and their colorful rhymes still take up space in my brain that could be better put to use, say, remembering exam dates or birthdays. I mean, come on, do I really need "I'll stirfry you in my wok"** in my head for the rest of my days? But I had forgotten them...until tonight. I randomly ran into some live concert of theirs, shot in artsy black and white, on what I think is a local station here in St. Louis. And it looked like a damn lot of fun. It's hard to tell from here, but it seemed like they put on a good show.   It's funny also how music can so quickly bring back vivid memories of other times in your life. In The Quad sophomore year at Oberlin, we listened to our fair share of Beastie Boys, along with tons of Radiohead and the Beatles' "Oh Darling" on repeat. But we got our share of the Boys, and hearing them tonight instantly brought me back to the late nights and bad smells of living with three other college guys.   **Actual Beastie Boys lyric

      This is less of a plug and more of a - "Hey, check this out. It's wicked funny." If you haven't already seen it, and many have, check out  urlLink homestarrunner.com . As far as I can tell, they're not selling anything, but they put together some really funny shorts and answer email. I'm not sure why it's so damn funny, but it is. Especially if you stick with it and watch a lot of their stuff.

      Well, we lost our first ultimate frisbee game. I think the score was 15-9. That's the funny thing about ultimate, it's so laid back that no one really knows when the game is over. Last night, one of the guys on the other team came up to our captain and said, "Hey Ragu, I think that's game." And Ragu (our captain) said, "Okay". Good story, I know. But I think we played well for our first time out there. I touched the disc once and was a few steps short of catching one in the end zone. And then there was beer and pizza afterward, which heals all wounds. And Donkey Kong. The place went had a Donkey Kong machine, as well as a Pac-Man one and one of those hockey games with the big glass dome where you move your guys around on little tracks using poles. I love that game. I was Canada, and I beat USA 2-0. And this was with my center dislodged from his track and lying in the other team's goal the entire time. Take that, USA!!

      So epic pics are back. Not that they ever went away, but it feels like they're back for some reason. I got to see   Troy  , which is the latest one. Meh, pretty good. I do think Orlando Bloom is destined to only be cast in epics now, although Kia thinks he looked better with the long blonde hair. I also think he'll be required to shoot arrows in every movie he's in from now on, since it just looks so right. He finally did it at the end of   Troy   and nailed Brad "Achilles" Pitt right in his....what's that part called, right behind your ankle? It's the one that is Achilles' only vulnerable spot, and if you hit Achilles right there, then Achilles will die...I think it's called, "The spot that really really hurts alot."   Oh, and one of the guys from   Braveheart   was in it too. I can't remember which one. One of the Scottish guys.

      I've caved. I decided to throw my hat into the ring. Here is my addition to the 4 billion (or so) webpages out there. I'd like to say that I've got lots of important burning issues to tackle or something, but really, it's just self-indulgence (as Leavy so finely put it). And it's summer in St. Louis, so I need something to do with my time.

      ESPN ranked the 25 worst teams of the past 25 years. I can think of at least one school that should be on  urlLink their list...   I mean, where is Oberlin College? Where is the Fighting Crimson? Or the Crimson Yeomen? Or the Fighting Farming Yeomen, or whatever the hell we're called? We didn't win a football game for four years, and then when we did we rushed the field (all 26 of us in attendance) and ripped down the goalposts. At least, I think that's what we did. That might have been a myth, an urban legend if you will. But I'd like to think we did that.

      So they  urlLink cancelled Lollapalooza  for 2004. This is surprising to me, given the success of other music festivals like  urlLink Coachella  and  urlLink Bonnaroo  and the popularity of some of the acts on the bill, especially the Pixies, who just reunited. Not to mention, of course, Wilco, the Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, Modest Mouse, and a bunch of other bands (including the Dresden Dolls, which a girl I know from high school is in).   Rather than surprised, I guess I'm more confused. How could all those AWESOME bands in one place be a bad thing? How could you not want to go and be a part of that? Some have mentioned  urlLink electronic file trading  as the cause. I don't think that's it. Maybe after 13 years people are just getting a little bored of the thing. I don't really know. It's kind of sad. My advice: Blame Bush.

      I wish I could post pictures on here, because this would be one time I'd really love to. Kia and I were driving today to a park that was strangely elusive, so much so that it required a stop at Steak n' Shake to refuel. On our whirlwind tour of suburban St. Louis, we saw a green yard sign, much like you'd see for a political candidate, sitting in a yard. It read, simply, "Jesus". A few houses later, there was another one. Sitting in the yard. Just "Jesus". Nothing else.   This struck me as funny for some reason, probably because I pictured it as an actual campaign sign, rather than simply a demonstration of faith on the part of the homeowner, which I'm sure it was. But I couldn't shake this idea of "Campaign 2004" for Savior of the Universe, or whatever Jesus would be running for. You'd see all sorts of smear attacks by the other candidates, claiming that he never REALLY walked on water, and that the whole "water into wine thing" was just a publicity stunt. And sure, he may have healed hundreds of lepers and cared for the sick and be the son of God and everything, but how is he going to handle foreign policy and a humungous deficit?   I could also picture the potential voters in this completely fabricated election that my mind created. Some of course would be completely for Jesus, all the way. They would most likely be the ones with the green signs on their lawns. Others would swing the other way and be totally against him. And some probably wouldn't care, as long as he knocked out the incumbent: "Anyone but Satan" (ooooh, that's good satire)  Funny that I saw this on Father's Day. I'm not sure why.

      I have a dog. His name is Teak. Teak is about 10 months old, which apparently is primetime for the rebellious stage in his life. If he could talk, I'm sure he'd say stuff like, "Whatever, Dad. You don't know what it's like to be me. You'll NEVER know what it's like to be me. You're not even a dog!" And he'd be right. He's also gotten more and more territorial as he's gotten older, growling or barking at people who may or may not be infringing on his territory. It's sort of cute, in a way.   Anyway, we were in the car today, and he was sitting on the passenger side, head out the window. We were stopped at a light, and a bus pulls up next to us with an ad on the side, like most of them have now. Teak immediately starts growling, which is pretty weird, because he usually just sort of hangs out and checks out the scenery while he's in the car. I look over at the ad, and it's for the St. Louis Zoo, and there's a big photograph of a polar bear from the neck up. Hilarious. He knew enough to identify the polar bear as an enemy, but not quite enough to realize that it was just a picture. Ahhh, kids.

      Forgive me, I'm running out of good puns on the word "ultimate" for my blog titles. And it's still early in the season. They will only get worse. Suggestions welcome (Leavy, this means you...you're great at this sort of thing).  Anyway, another ultimate frisbee match tonight. We had 1 win and 2 losses coming into the game, but of course I wasn't there for the only win, so I was hungry. Hungry, I tell you. I could smell it. I could feel a win.   Without going into too much detail, we prevailed, 13-11. I caught a few points in the end zone, including the final 2 to give us the win, so that felt pretty good. And on the drive home, for some reason my mind was wandering and I started wondering if any good movies have been made with ultimate as the subject, or at least playing a major role. I could think of none. It's featured in  PCU , the movie that very effectively satirizes almost every aspect of liberal arts colleges (I swear those guys must have gone to Oberlin), but not much else comes to mind.   I open up the floor: Any movies, documentary or otherwise, that feature ultimate frisbee in any meaningful manner? I await your responses.

      God bless the Detroit Pistons. It was looking pretty bleak there for a while for any team east of the ol' Mississippi. But the Pistons redeemed all of us Easterners last night. They toppled the Giant, known as the LA Lakers, to end a series that was about as one-sided as NBA Finals series get. They took it handily, 4-1, and if they had played their cards right in Game 2 (by fouling Kobe Bryant before he could hit a ridiculous 3-pointer), it's very possible that they could have swept. No one saw this coming. No one gave the Pistons a chance. And that's why it's even sweeter.   On a side note, I love that Kid Rock and Hank Williams, Jr. were at the game sitting next to each other, Kid Rock with cigar in hand.

      In trying to find my blog online, Kia utilized our favorite friend, Google. She typed in "aaron bonner-jackson blog", and discovered that someone with the name "BonnerJackson Aaron" is quite active on dozens (literally dozens) of blogs, sprinkling wisdom and knowledge around like so much birdseed on the path of life that may never be taken again. Here is an assortment of what we found from this guy:  -"Ethics is not necessarily the handmaiden of theology" -- I don't even know what the hell that means.   -"Good people strengthen themselves ceaselessly" -- Em....alright.  -"It is never a mistake to say good-bye" -- What kind of advice is that??   -"It's safer to play with a man's wife than with his cliches" -- Whoa. I'm not touching that one.   -"There are no weird people - some just require more understanding" -- Not true. I've met some truly weird people, and no amount of understanding could understand them.   There are  urlLink tons more . At this point, I'm pretty sure it's just a program that puts together words that sound deep or insightful, but actually aren't. Talking about ethics and understanding usually sounds deep. I just don't know how this program -- or whatever it is -- ended up with what is so close to my name. I have a pretty strange name. And I thought I was the only one! So to the fortune cookie writer who is doing this, give me my name back, and stop posting trite, pithy crap. Thank you.

      Kia and I got back from our trip to Chicago yesterday. So much to say, I really think I like that city. I've never spent any real substantial amount of time in it, and this time was no exception but I felt like I got a better sense of it than any other time before. Probably because we had to drive all over to see everyone we were supposed to see. So for those of you who don't like to read, who are drunk, who only want the Cliff's Notes, or all of the above: Trip was great. But there was so much more.   For example, before we even got to Chicago, there was the trip there. Once again, I'll refer to the header of this blog. It promises "midwestern oddities," and this trip didn't disappoint. Soon after we left St. Louis, we were thrust (plunged) into the middle of nowhere. About 95% of the drive between St. Louis and Chicago is through straight, flat, unremarkable farmland. Beautiful, but pretty ordinary. Those of you who went to Oberlin may remember something like this. So we had to make our own fun. Things we saw on our drive:  -A series of small signs, spaced about 30 yards apart, that when read together said "Homeland security starts at home - guns save life.com". Ignoring for the moment the atrocious grammar, there are just so many things wrong with that. I don't think I'm even going to go into it. I mean, I like guns as much as the next guy. I enjoyed shooting Neil's beebee gun at beer bottles in the backyard of our house while shirtless and drinking beer as much as the next guy, but that was a beebee gun, and they were bottles. Full of non-alcoholic beer. I just have a visceral reaction to the idea of everyone thinking they need a gun to protect themselves against some unseen evil that's lurking outside their door. It's dangerous. They do more bad than good. Don't get one. Later on we also saw a series of signs that, when read together said the Lord's prayer ("Hail Mary, full of grace, etc.") and we both half expected it to end "guns save life.com". That wouldn't have been a shocker.   -A shed that probably housed animals, painted in brilliant colors, that read, "Start your day with pork!" That was less shocking or maddening than the gun signs for me, but to Kia, who is a vegetarian, this wasn't ok either. I think it was the bright colors. You never see signs like that in cities. At least not in such obvious ways. It's more like, "Start your day with this fatty breakfast sandwich that contains pork and egg-like substitute." There's no sugar coating it on the farm. If you have to go out that day and kill Wilbur, then you've gotta kill Wilbur. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't do well on a farm for that reason.   -On the mudflaps of a big truck in front of us: "Alcohol, drugs, and diesel don't mix." Truer words were never said. It's odd to me to have a public service announcement on the mudflaps of a diesel truck, and a public service announcement for truckers, no less. You don't see many PSAs for truckers...although if you did, having them on mudflaps of trucks is as good a place as any. I think if I were a trucker, the temptation would be pretty great to take lots of caffeine pills and stay up all night driving, a la Homer in that episode where he becomes a trucker after another trucker dies in a steak eating contest.   -Odell, IL. We wanted to stop for lunch, and randomly picked this tiny little town on the side of the highway. Population around 1000. We went into the local restaurant, called "The Wishing Well Cafe". The only other customer in there was a woman who was about 80, who you could tell was a regular. In a town that size, I guess you have to be. There's nowhere else to eat. There was also almost nothing on the menu that didn't have some form of meat in it. But Kia survived on grilled cheese, peaches, and cottage cheese. So lots of dairy. If you're a vegan in Odell, you're screwed. All in all, a nice little town. It had railroad tracks going through it, and we got really excited when a train passed through. I love that.   -Once in Chicago, we saw 2 sets of Kia's aunts and uncles, one from each side of the family. They paid for meals, took us out to movies, and kept us out of trouble. All of them were funny in their own ways.   -Dunkin Donuts. They don't HAVE those in St. Louis. I have gone without for too long. The first set of Kia's relatives took us there one morning. I am complete again. I am whole. You can have your Krispy Kremes all you want. Give me my DD.   - Shrek 2 . I liked it. It was good fun. Unfortunately, it was Eddie Murphy's best work in a long time. I mean, come on: "The Haunted Mansion"? "Daddy Day Care"? Eddie, what have you become?   -Shedd Aquarium, the aquarium in Chicago. Very good, but way to pricey ($21 per person). As Kia's uncle Gary said, "Too many kids and fish." We saw sharks, though. And beluga whales, dolphins, penguins, and otters. Not bad. And the view from there onto the lake and the city was incredible. It was a perfect day for it.   -Soldier Field, the stadium where the Chicago Bears play football. If you happen to be in the area, I'd recommend you shield your eyes. It's hideous. On the outside, it's still a memorial to war veterans, as it was intended to be. But they completely revamped and refurbished the inside, so from the outside it looks like a big spaceship landed inside this old building. It's completely muddled and half-assed. Either make it old or make it new. I'm all about new stadiums with older sensibilities. Camden Yards, for example. Gorgeous. Jacobs Field. Also nice. And then there's Fenway, which really is old, so that doesn't count. It's a shrine. But the Bears are stuck with a god-awful piece of crap, to match their playing style, and I can't say I feel sorry for them. I'm pretty sure that stems from my bitterness about the 1985 Super Bowl (Bears - 46, Patriots - 10). But who's got the last laugh now, huh?? What's that? Who's won two Super Bowls in the last three years? No, I'm pretty sure it wasn't da Bears. Ah, yes...the Pats. God bless the Pats. Bill Bellichick is a genius and Tom Brady is a star, while Mike Ditka is doing athlete's foot commercials and William "Refrigerator" Perry is somewhere right now 200 pounds overweight and nursing a heart condition.   -The Lyon's Den, where my friend Pete's comedy show was. Sort of a dive, but a pleasant dive. You feel like you could have a good time there, have a few drinks and enjoy yourself. Other nights of the week they have rock and punk shows there, and you could sort of tell. But Pete was great. He had about 45 minutes of material, which is really impressive. All of it strong. I wish him the best of luck in NYC.   -At dinner before Pete's show, we saw someone at the next table who could very well have been Markie Post (of "Night Court" and "There's Something About Mary" fame). We took a few pictures, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible, but nothing definitive. To our credit, she did have a shirt with an "M" on it, although why Markie Post would be wearing a big "M" on her shirt is beyond me. Anyway, that was our brush with a second or third tier famous person.   There were lots of other things here and there, but that's enough for now. I didn't get a chance to see Wrigley Field and I didn't see Wilco. Maybe next time.

      Off to Chicago this weekend to see my friend Pete in his  urlLink last comedy hurrah  before moving to NYC to try and break into the big time. If you're in the Chicago/Illinois/Middle of the Country area, I'd recommend checking it out. And it's free. No loss if you don't like it. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. No harm, no foul. Wrap and play. If there's grass on the field, play ball.   I'm gonna stop now.

      Ray Borque, a defenseman for the Boston Bruins for over 20 years, has been elected to the hockey Hall of Fame. He's probably one of the classiest hockey players the game has ever had.

      I guess I picked an interesting weekend to re-visit all the old haunts of Maryland and DC. I was there this past weekend. And wouldn't you know it, the day after I get there, Reagan dies. I'm not really sure what to think of that. Maybe it's a sign. So there was that. And the next day was D-Day. And that's a big deal too, more for the French than for us, and with good reason. And yet, somehow with all of this going on I managed to almost completely avoid the media superhypermegablitz, thanks to my three good friends --  urlLink alcohol ,  urlLink Chipotle , and  urlLink the Metro . I'd have to say that I spent about 75% of my weekend with, or on the way to, one of these three treasures. And I certainly wouldn't have made it through the weekend without them.   I got to see my mom and sister, as well as my uncle, aunt, and cousin, and his girlfriend, all of whom happened to be there at the same time too. My cousin had never seen the White House before, so we went over there, following the throngs. Once we got there, it was the usual, "Yep, there it is" type of reaction. Not much to see that you haven't seen on The West Wing or that movie "Dave", where the regular Joe Shmoe guy becomes the president. (I only mentioned that because I just saw some of it on cable again the other day. Great movie. My favorite part is when they sing "Tomorrow" out on the street in front of the cops). Anyway, that was the White House. I think my favorite part about being there is seeing the tourists who, instead of photographing the place, are actually taking  video  of it. Like they expect at any minute it will sprout legs, pull up its roots, and start running down the Mall, followed closely by Lincoln, Jefferson, the Washington Monument, and all of the World War II vets.   Other events of note from my trip:  -On one of my flights, I was sitting behind someone whom I was convinced was Michael Moore. I think it was the baseball cap and the thick neck. Anyway, it wasn't him.   -I became even more enamored (yes, enamored) with this album by the Shins. It's called "Oh, Inverted World". You have to sit with it and give it a chance, but once you do, kablam-o. I would recommend getting it. In the words of Ben Stiller in "Starsky and Hutch" -- "Do it. Do it."   -I must have seen about 14 trillion dead cicadas. It was pretty impressive, almost Biblical.

      I leave for one week (ONE WEEK) and everything goes to hell. Farewell, Nomar. Good luck in Chicago. I would wish for the Sox and Cubs to meet in the World Series some day, but that would be just too cruel, because someone would have to lose.

      Oh, and BTW: Have any of you blogger.com people noticed that lots of these blogs are actually just porn sites in disguise? Like porn guys are just using the space to publish erotic stories and links to their porn sites. Not that I mind, but, you know, I just thought you should be aware of it.

      Starting Saturday, I will be spending a week in a house on a lake in Oxford County, Maine, which apparently is about 40 miles south of Augusta, with Kia and my family. Tomorrow, we fly to Boston, leaving behind our dog (read: only child) for 12 days. We drive up the next day. I'm very much looking forward to this: whitewater rafting, swimming, fishing, golf, all meals and expenses taken care of. This is the life.   So no posts for about a week. You'll just have to entertain yourselves, dammit. I do expect lots of comments, though. Feel free to use this site as a chatroom. I'll give you a topic...Dick Cheney is both a dick and a cheney. Discuss.

      In every city, there are certain places or streets or neighborhoods that, for one reason or another, you probably don't venture into too much, if at all. One such area in St. Louis is called Page Avenue. At its best, it's just sort of rundown and industrial looking, lots of warehouses and fast food places. However, this past weekend I got to experience the other side, if only briefly. Hilda, a friend Kia and I know from Oberlin, was visiting, and we wanted to get some booze. Being the complete dorkos that we are, we of course looked in a  phone book  for the closest liquor store, since I thought that the supermarket prices were a ripoff. (Seriously, who looks in a phone book for a liquor store? Honestly.)   Anyway, we locate one that seems reasonably close to our apartment, and we head off to Page Ave. Before reaching the one we were headed for, we found a different liquor store en route, which looked more like a cabin in the woods than anything else. We went in. Everything was behind glass, prices hard to see, sketchy people inside. We left.   We passed at least two other liquor stores before finding the one we actually set out to find. Another thing that happened before we found our intended store was that I ran a red light. Barely. I breezed through just as it was turning red. Fortunately, a police officer was right there to catch me and make sure I didn't hurt anyone. He pulled me over, took a look at my Maryland plates and my Massachusetts license and asked me "Where are you staying at?" I told him I lived here, he asked me where, and I told him. He asked if I went to college here, and instead of getting into a semantic argument about that with him, I just said, "Yes." Yes, I go to college here.   He proceeded to inform me that my reckless behavior could have hurt someone (that was expected). He also told me that what they usually do for people like me who have out-of-state driver's licenses is that they put them in jail (??!!?)&nbsp;until they can post bail. Um, what? I think I was too shocked and awed by what he had just said, and also I didn't want to make things worse, but&nbsp;in retrospect I'd really like an explanation for that. You're going to lock me up in jail, just for&nbsp;running a red light and&nbsp;not having a Missouri license? I'm not in Kansas anymore. Actually, they might do the same thing in Kansas. I have no idea.   Needless to&nbsp;say, this put a damper on the evening momentarily. This was alleviated by actually finding our destination: a&nbsp;bright yellow, sketchy-as-all-hell shack that supposedly sold liquor inside. We didn't even bother. We&nbsp;ended up going to the grocery store, a 2 minute drive from our apartment. I vowed never to venture into that neighborhood again.   [Here is the spot where&nbsp;I rant about social injustice and how wrong it is that so many liquor stores are located in the poorest areas of the&nbsp;city]  As a post-script,&nbsp;the officer who gave me the ticket told me I had to call&nbsp;to find out how much my ticket was for. I did this. The person who answered&nbsp;informed&nbsp;me that the clerk's office only&nbsp;accepted calls between 9 and 1.&nbsp;At this point, it was 3, and they were no longer accepting calls. But clearly someone picked up.&nbsp;So&nbsp;they were accepting calls. Could she not just tell me how much my ticket was for?&nbsp;No. But I could come by the courthouse and find out. Or call the next day between&nbsp;9 and 1. I still haven't called. &nbsp;

      First round of the playoffs. An anti-climactic 15-9 loss to a beatable team. I think there were high school kids on this team. That hurts. A good experience overall, but it would have been nice to win at least one playoff game.

      [I saw this on another blog and thought I should pass it along] &nbsp; Kissing Hank's Ass &nbsp; This morning there was a knock at my door. When I answered the door I found a well groomed, nicely dressed couple. The man spoke first:  &nbsp; John: "Hi! I'm John, and this is Mary."  Mary: Hi! We're here to invite you to come kiss Hank's ass with us."  Me: "Pardon me?! What are you talking about? Who's Hank, and why would I want to kiss His ass?"  &nbsp; John: "If you kiss Hank's ass, He'll give you a million dollars; and if you don't, He'll kick the shit out of you."  Me: "What? Is this some sort of bizarre mob shake-down?"  &nbsp; John: "Hank is a billionaire philanthropist. Hank built this town. Hank owns this town. He can do whatever He wants, and what He wants is to give you a million dollars, but He can't until you kiss His ass."  Me: "That doesn't make any sense. Why..."  &nbsp; Mary: "Who are you to question Hank's gift? Don't you want a million dollars? Isn't it worth a little kiss on the ass?"  Me: "Well maybe, if it's legit, but..."  John: "Then come kiss Hank's ass with us."  &nbsp; Me: "Do you kiss Hank's ass often?"  Mary: "Oh yes, all the time..."  Me: "And has He given you a million dollars?"  John: "Well no. You don't actually get the money until you leave town."  &nbsp; Me: "So why don't you just leave town now?"  Mary: "You can't leave until Hank tells you to, or you don't get the money, and He kicks the shit out of you."  &nbsp; Me: "Do you know anyone who kissed Hank's ass, left town, and got the million dollars?"  John: "My mother kissed Hank's ass for years. She left town last year, and I'm sure she got the money."  &nbsp; Me: "Haven't you talked to her since then?"  John: "Of course not, Hank doesn't allow it."  &nbsp; Me: "So what makes you think He'll actually give you the money if you've never talked to anyone who got the money?"  Mary: "Well, He gives you a little bit before you leave. Maybe you'll get a raise, maybe you'll win a small lotto, maybe you'll just find a twenty-dollar bill on the street."  &nbsp; Me: "What's that got to do with Hank?"  John: "Hank has certain 'connections.'"  &nbsp; Me: "I'm sorry, but this sounds like some sort of bizarre con game."  John: "But it's a million dollars, can you really take the chance? And remember, if you don't kiss Hank's ass He'll kick the shit out of you."  &nbsp; Me: "Maybe if I could see Hank, talk to Him, get the details straight from Him..." Mary: "No one sees Hank, no one talks to Hank."  Me: "Then how do you kiss His ass?"  &nbsp; John: "Sometimes we just blow Him a kiss, and think of His ass. Other times we kiss Karl's ass, and he passes it on."  Me: "Who's Karl?"  Mary: "A friend of ours. He's the one who taught us all about kissing Hank's ass. All we had to do was take him out to dinner a few times."  &nbsp; Me: "And you just took his word for it when he said there was a Hank, that Hank wanted you to kiss His ass, and that Hank would reward you?"  John: "Oh no! Karl has a letter he got from Hank years ago explaining the whole thing. Here's a copy; see for yourself."  &nbsp; From the desk of Karl: 1- Kiss Hank's ass and He'll give you a million dollars when you leave town.  2- Use alcohol in moderation.  3- Kick the shit out of people who aren't like you.  4- Eat right.  5- Hank dictated this list Himself.  6- The moon is made of green cheese.  7- Everything Hank says is right.  8- Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.  9- Don't use alcohol.  10- Eat your wieners on buns, no condiments.  11- Kiss Hank's ass or He'll kick the shit out of you. &nbsp; Me: "This appears to be written on Karl's letterhead."  Mary: "Hank didn't have any paper."  Me: "I have a hunch that if we checked we'd find this is Karl's handwriting."  John: "Of course, Hank dictated it."  &nbsp; Me: "I thought you said no one gets to see Hank?" Mary: "Not now, but years ago He would talk to some people."  Me: "I thought you said He was a philanthropist. What sort of philanthropist kicks the shit out of people just because they're different?"  &nbsp; Mary: "It's what Hank wants, and Hank's always right."  Me: "How do you figure that?"  Mary: "Item 7 says 'Everything Hank says is right.' That's good enough for me!"  &nbsp; Me: "Maybe your friend Karl just made the whole thing up."  John: "No way! Item 5 says 'Hank dictated this list himself.' Besides, item 2 says 'Use alcohol in moderation,' Item 4 says 'Eat right,' and item 8 says 'Wash your hands after going to the bathroom.' Everyone knows those things are right, so the rest must be true, too."  &nbsp; Me: "But 9 says 'Don't use alcohol.' which doesn't quite go with item 2, and 6 says 'The moon is made of green cheese,' which is just plain wrong."  John: "There's no contradiction between 9 and 2, 9 just clarifies 2. As far as 6 goes, you've never been to the moon, so you can't say for sure."  &nbsp; Me: "Scientists have pretty firmly established that the moon is made of rock..."  Mary: "But they don't know if the rock came from the Earth, or from out of space, so it could just as easily be green cheese."  &nbsp; Me: "I'm not really an expert, but I think the theory that the Moon was somehow 'captured' by the Earth has been discounted*. Besides, not knowing where the rock came from doesn't make it cheese."  John: "Ha! You just admitted that scientists make mistakes, but we know Hank is always right!"  &nbsp; Me: "We do?"  Mary: "Of course we do, Item 7 says so." Me: "You're saying Hank's always right because the list says so, the list is right because Hank dictated it, and we know that Hank dictated it because the list says so. That's circular logic, no different than saying 'Hank's right because He says He's right.'"  &nbsp; John: "Now you're getting it! It's so rewarding to see someone come around to Hank's way of thinking."  Me: "But...oh, never mind. What's the deal with wieners?"  Mary: She blushes.  John: "Wieners, in buns, no condiments. It's Hank's way. Anything else is wrong."  &nbsp; Me: "What if I don't have a bun?"  John: "No bun, no wiener. A wiener without a bun is wrong."  Me: "No relish? No Mustard?"  &nbsp; Mary: She looks positively stricken.  John: (shouting) "There's no need for such language! Condiments of any kind are wrong!"  &nbsp; Me: "So a big pile of sauerkraut with some wieners chopped up in it would be out of the question?"  Mary: Sticks her fingers in her ears."I am not listening to this. La la la, la la, la la la."  John: "That's disgusting. Only some sort of evil deviant would eat that..."  &nbsp; Me: "It's good! I eat it all the time."  Mary: She faints.  John: He catches Mary. "Well, if I'd known you were one of those I wouldn't have wasted my time. When Hank kicks the shit out of you I'll be there, counting my money and laughing. I'll kiss Hank's ass for you, you bunless cut-wienered kraut-eater."

       A friend of mine is driving across the country, from California to Massachusetts, to bring someone's minivan to them. That, to me, is really cool. I love roadtrips. I love the open road. She visited me here in St. Louis, about halfway to her destination, and said that she had been listening to a lot of Christian radio along the way. I guess with just a tape player and a radio that was about the only option through Oklahoma and Kansas and Missouri. She had also been listening to Bill Clinton's book on tape, which she lent to me. I'm hoping I get a chance to listen to it, because I'm definitely interested to hear it. Plus, he reads it himself, and I kind of miss hearing him speak. Sort of in the way you miss hearing your parents speaking in the other room, like everything is going to be ok. Everything was ok when he was President. Sure, America had problems. The world had problems. But with Bill, it was going to be alright. Maybe listening to his book will help me return to those more innocent times. I did wonder about the title though. "My Life"?? You couldn't come up with a better title to an autobiography than "My Life"?? Come on, Bill.     &nbsp;   On another note, my friend's name is Cora Stryker, and another function of her cross-country trip is to distribute copies of her novel to independent bookstores in various cities. She's self-publishing and doing everything herself. That, to me, is amazing. &nbsp;

       I had the exquisite pleasure of attending my first country concert with Kia last weekend. Well, my first one ever. Not just with her. It was her second one. Truly a unique experience. I wish I had posted this sooner, so more of the details would be fresh in my mind. But alas, procrastination is a tough mistress. All in all, it was a good time. The main act was Tim McGraw. He's a good performer, but for some reason I thought he'd play the guitar at least once. He did elicit lots of passionate screams from the female portion of the audience for pretty much anything he did. And there were lots of women wearing cowboy hats. The funniest parts for me were when he'd announce that the next song was from his new album, and everyone who was standing would sit down. Then the next song would start and people would pop up again. Then a few songs later, everyone sits. It was like church. And he talked about God and the war too. Yeah, it was a lot like church. All things considered, I had a good time. There's something about live music that I really love. Even if I don't know most of the words to the songs or what a "ragtop" is.     &nbsp;  The unpleasant part of the evening had nothing to do with the music or Tim McGraw or the 40-year-old women swooning two rows in front of us. The concert was at one of these outdoor pavilion places, where the seats are under a roof and there's also a lawn seating section. It used to have a nice name, but now it's owned by a bank and, therefore, is named after the bank. It's a trend I've noticed in lots of cities. Great Woods in Massachusetts is now called The Tweeter Center after an electronics store. Concert venues are getting named after beers and banks and cars. WTF? It takes some of the fun out of the whole experience to say, "Yeah, I'm seeing so-and-so at Microsoft Megaglobalcorp Toyota Stadium, brought to you in part by Red Bull." Not to mention sports arenas and stadiums. I won't even get into that. So that part got to me a little. When I saw Radiohead last August at the same place, Thom Yorke made some mention of it. Something like, "We're not playing here for them, we're playing here for you." Sometimes it's hard to distinguish the two.

      Listening today to "Deadweight" by Beck (a good song by a great musician), I realized that this was one of those songs that I came to know, appreciate, and enjoy in a different way than most people. This was a song that I heard first, not in its original form, but as an a cappella song. To be exact, performed by a group from U of Buffalo called, appropriately, the Buffalo Chips. (There is an unspoken rule in a cappella that the name of your group must be some play on your school name, a musical term, or both.) Anyway, I first heard "Deadweight" when the Buffalo Chips came to perform at Oberlin a few years ago.   The disturbing thing is that this is not the only song that I came to listen to via the a cappella route. I can think of a few others off the top of my head -- "Redemption Song" by Bob Marley; "Bouncing Around the Room" by Phish; "Running to Stand Still" by U2; "Babylon" by David Gray; "Don't You Forget About Me" from The Breakfast Club...the list goes on. All I can say is that you listen to a song differently after you've heard it done a cappella first. You can hear how the elements are put together in a way I don't think is possible before. Yes, at times it's still a ridiculous musical form. It can be over the top and can sometimes ruin the music it's trying to emulate. It might not be as cool as being on the lacrosse team or being some college radio snob. But I will say this: the chicks dig it. Being in a cappella groups has supplied me with three girlfriends, as well as making other girls think you're a sensitive, new age guy by baring your soul up on stage while making awful beatbox noises with your mouth. Try getting a girlfriend by playing lacrosse, punk.  My final thought: The only other phenomenenon like the one I just described with a cappella that I can think of is The Simpsons. Many times I have heard a reference or person or place or idea described on The Simpsons before I have come across said entity in real life. But rarely will one ever acquire a girlfriend watching The Simpsons. Well, maybe Neil could pull it off.

      Another brutal bitch-ass storm hit St. Louis Monday night, conveniently right as my utlimate team was getting off the field after a 15-13 win. We fled in the face of the clouds that were about to consume us. One guy mentioned the idea of building an ark. That wouldn't have been a bad idea.   On my ride home, the sky to my left was totally dark: death and destruction. The sky to my right was just the opposite: bright and orange, except in a sort of eerie, creepy way, like it was the apocalypse or something. Luckily, I got home before bad stuff started to happen. The next day, all kinds of trees were down in my neighborhood. Very lucky, too, that none of them hit our apartment or cars, although a tree hitting my car would most likely represent an improvement.   But the major upshot of all of this: cable is out. No internet. No TV. Actually, that's not true. We do get one channel. So this morning, I treated myself to about 5 minutes of Montel. His guest was a woman who claimed to be clairvoyant or have contact with the dead or something. An audience member said that she was separated from her husband and asked if they were going to get divorced. The woman said yes. Brilliant.   So this is me with no TV. Luckily, I did have beer. Good beer. It's called Schlafly (pronounced "Shlaa-fleee"). It's brewed in St. Louis. It makes me feel like a real local. And it makes me feel like I'm sticking it to "The Man" (Budweiser) by not drinking their beer, even though they're also locally brewed. Based solely on taste, Schlafly kicks some serious Budweiser ass. It takes those Bud frogs, and a few of the Clydesdales, and mixes them up into a shake that it drinks before a workout. If you get the chance, I recommend you try one.

      (the following is an actual section of the  urlLink online newsletter  for the World Adult Kickball Association, Bethesda, MD, league)   GREAT MOMENTS IN KICKBALL HISTORY    by George Convery   July 23rd, 2003   With his team just ½ a game below .500, the playoffs only 2 weeks away, and facing a tough division rival in Gluckzilla and the Fleeing Villagers, Aaron Bonner-Jackson of Baby Got Backspin was out there putting it all on the line.  Leaving second base, Bonner-Jackson stumbled on the slick grass.  The pitcher, Mike Blum, corralled the ball kicked right back to the mound and stood a mere 10 feet away the runner.  Blum quickly closed the gap and looked for the peg, which is when ABJ saw his chance.  Using his plastic man-like abilities he managed to maneuver his body around the hurled sphere causing it to sail into the outfield.  Bonner-Jackson then scooted around 3rd and headed home as BGB went onto route the higher ranked Fleeing Villagers.  On the ground one second, thanks to some amazing agility, standing on home plate the next.  Aaron Bonner-Jackson thank you for another Great Moment in Kickball.

      Ok, this will serve as Red Sox Rant #2. Let the record show that Red Sox Rant #1 was a rather positive affair, a pleasant outlook with sunny skies and light winds out of the southeast, high temperatures of 76 degrees. Well, let me tell you: the winds have shifted since my last forecast. The sunny skies have turned into a strange mix of rain, hail, and blood (yes, all at once). The light winds have turned into a wicked pissah nor'easter (that's a really really strong storm for the rest of you). In April, the Sox swept the Yankees in Yankee Stadium (aka "The Death Star"). They were leading the AL East. Oh what a difference a couple of months makes. Time heals all wounds and destroys all hopes for the Good Guys. It seems like just yesterday that everyone was looking ahead to the playoffs. Now, the Boston media is saying the Sox should just shoot for the wildcard. What does that even mean??? Play well, but not too well. Just well enough to come in second to the Yankees. Again.   That, I must say, is the infuriating thing about the sports scene in Boston, it's just so reactionary and quick to judge. They love you one minute and hate you the next. How long ago did all of Boston rejoice at Nomar's return? And already they're calling for a trade. Why? Because he's not perfect yet. Because maybe he didn't come back at 100% and he's working out the kinks, the way most players do in spring training. Except this isn't the Grapefruit League, this is the real deal now, and the smallest foul up gets magnified and analyzed and people start calling for your head. They turn on you. I wouldn't blame Nomar if he wanted to get out of Boston ASAP, just to be able to get out from under the microscope. That sort of thing can really get to you. That's why David Wells left the Yankees, a perennial World Series contender, for the San Diego Padres, who are.....the San Diego Padres. He's 3-5 with a 3.25 ERA, and I'm sure he couldn't be happier.   I'd like to not over-react to a sweep at the hands of the Yankees at this point in the season, but it's pretty hard. I keep thinking the Sox have a huge run in them, that they'll go on a big tear and rip it up. I know they can do it, they've done it before. When their offense is clicking, they're unstoppable. Their pitching has all the ingredients. The next month will be crucial.

If you have seen it, all of the ranting I just did makes a little more sense, and hopefully will remind you fondly of such a great flick. I was laughing even before it started. And the best part: it takes place entirely in Idaho. Come on, name me one other movie that even involves Idaho in any way. I dare you.

      I'm packing up stuff for the move next weekend. Kia and I are moving to a place a few miles away, about the same rent but a better place. It feels bigger, bigger kitchen, it's got a backyard, some stained glass windows. It feels like a house, rather than a big apartment complex. And it's in a part of town called Richmond Heights. Classy. Who wouldn't love that?  I'm realizing we just have lots of crap. Lots. And it took us nearly a year to get it all crammed in here just right so that it wouldn't impede our day-to-day living too much. And now we have to unearth it all, put it away, move, and start again. I find myself marking boxes with descriptions like "Bookcase in study," or for lack of a better term, "Random". I know what it means, and that's all that matters. I think Teak, our dog, is convinced we're going to move and leave him here. The thought has crossed my mind, but I guess we'll have to bring him.

      I realized I hadn't given any updates on the vaca (that's short for "vacation") that I took with the fam (that's short for "family") in Boston/Maine. Kia came with me, so it was the five of us (me, my sister Kate, Kia, Mom, Dad) in a small house on a lake. Very relaxing, very quiet. The first couple of days, a husky from next door came and said hi to us. That was nice and it helped with the dog withdrawal symptoms we were both feeling. There was some canoeing, some fishing (although I got not so much as a nibble), some swimming (although the bottom of the lake had lots of grass and stuff and I'm squeamish about that sort of thing), and a bunch of puzzles. Our prize piece was one by Van Gogh. Boy, could that bastard paint a puzzle. Best puzzle painter I've ever seen.  Other events not to be forgotten:  -I grew facial hair until I was sick of it, just to make sure I could. I had never really tried very hard, so I thought it would be a good thing to do. I got what you might consider a beard, then shaved it to a goutee, then to a skeezy looking mustache. All was documented on film, if you'd like proof. I wouldn't recommend it. Just take my word for it.  -Whitewater rafting. Oh yeah, it was fun. Parts of it were incredible and exhilarating. During the safety lecture, my mother had second thoughts about the whole thing and almost bailed. But she ended up having a very good time. None of us fell out of the boat. And we went through Class 5 rapids, the highest you're allowed to go through. Boo-ya.  -I kicked Kia's ass at Monopoly. I don't think she has the killer instinct to win the game. I kept piling on the houses and hotels, but she just wanted to keep what she had so I wouldn't lose any money. Very sweet of her. I put some hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place. She didn't last long.  -Golf. I played with my dad for the first time in 2 years. Surprisingly, I was not as bad as I could have been. I had 4 pars. I was relatively pleased. For 9 holes, we played with a local kid, maybe 17 years old, who was a member there and gave us all the tips for how to play the holes. He told us that one summer he played 54 holes a day (fifty-four), three or four days a week. If you're going fast, and I mean whipping through the course, you can do 18 holes in 4 hours. 54 holes would take you 12 hours, minimum. That's sunup to sundown, 3-4 days a week. Badass.  -Mini golf. I lost. To everyone. I demand a rematch.  -The house we stayed in had a huge cutout of a parrot on the wall and said "Parrot Fever". I'm not even going to venture a guess about that one.  -During the trip, Kia and I frequented as many Dunkin' Donuts as was humanly possible, given that there are none in St. Louis, which I think is absurd. It did make for an interesting diet, though, trying to stuff all of those donuts and coffee into yourself as often as you could.  -Speaking of diet, I also ate clam chowda at every meal out. I counted at least four different restaurants where I had it. And they were four different chowdas. Not one the same as any others. Fascinating.  -Oh, the title of this post: We got out of town just in the nick of time to miss all of the Democratic National Convention craziness. Apparently, the city was pretty quiet the whole week. I guess everyone else had the same idea as we did.

      American Idol auditions are happening here in St. Louis this weekend. This is my chance....to make a complete ass of myself on TV. I've always wanted to do that. Seriously, the only people who get on, of the thousands who show up and wait in line, are the ones who are kickass good or who are laugh-out-loud awful. I guess I'll have to try and be laugh-out-loud awful. Does anybody have the words to "Wind Beneath My Wings"?

      Catching up on the convention after being away, I found this quote from Al Gore:  "I'll be candid with you. I had hoped to be back here this week under different circumstances, running for re-election. But you know the old saying: you win some, you lose some. And then there's that little-known third category."
