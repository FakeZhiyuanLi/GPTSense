       Ones born of heart and darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all worlds and bring desolation.  Sieze all hearts and consummate the great heart. All hearts to be one, one heart to encompass all.  Realize the destiny: the realm of Kingdom hearts. The great darkness sealed within the great heart.  Progeny of darkness, come back to the eternal darkness.  For the heart of light shall unseal the path, seven hearts, on keyhole, one key to the door.   The door of darkness, tied by two keys. The door of darkness to seal the light.   None shall pass but shadows, returning to the darkness.  One born of the heart and darkness, hunger for every heart untill the dark door opens.      im bored so i typed this sucker up from kingdom hearts.  me:

              hey doods,  my sister wrote this letter to the supernintendo of the schools because she is so mad at him, (Written maybe the 15th)  and she signed it her name. the other day she got a message from his office to have a meeting with him to talk about the email. good luck katie! here is the email. ~~~~~ to whom it may concern:  I know that Mr. Livingston is most likely not going to read this. So could you please forward this to him if that is the case.   It has been brought to my attention, that there are several teacher who will not be returning to the high school next year. Way to go. You have by far taken away the best teachers there are. I can not see how you can take away a teacher that we see everyday and know very well and replace them with a new teacher. The thing is, if we "have a budget crisis" or whatever your ridiculous reasoning behind this choice, you will ultimately end up hiring more teachers to replace these ones, and then fire their asses after a few years like you did to the ones this year.   Why not get rid of non-essential personal in the school, or even better, expenses that are not necessary. For example, do you, Mr. Livingston, really need a raise every year, when there are all these other expenses that are more important to children's education? Or how about the "curriculum director?" do we really need that? Don’t tell me its because of MCAS. She doesn’t prepare us for that. Was she there when 72 kids were stressed out sophomore year? More importantly, were YOU there? I don’t remember seeing you there. Oh yeah, and this Camilla Huston, who is she? No one has heard of her, other than the ones in your nice big air-conditioned office at the town hall. How about Peter Roche? wouldn’t know him if I saw him. The only one I can match a face with is you. That is only because I was forced as a high school student to sit through speeches, you um, delivered. Were you at the high school award ceremony for the freshman, sophomore, and juniors? I don’t remember seeing you there? But I do however, remember, since my days back at shaker lane, the old superintendent, Mr. Franco, at every single social, academic, and school event. Were you at graduation because you wanted to be there? or because you had to be there?  Come to think of it, I hardly ever remember seeing you at school. I think I may have seen you three times, if that. The teachers that aren't going to be there next year are the ones I always saw. The ones that helped me through high school aren't going to be there for other students.   As it has been drilled into our heads since you came here and gave us this "mission statement," "our mission is to inspire and sustain learning and achievement, preparing each student for the challenges of life in the 21st century" (www.littletonps.org). You are indeed, Mr. Livingston, preparing us. We are going to have to learn to look for jobs every two or three years in our lives.   In addition to "preparing" us, you have given us another lesson in life. That is to not live in Littleton, or whatever town you deicide to destroy after this one.   Thank you   ~~~~~  i agree with this letter.   me:

       why am i making a blog? maybe to keep me sane, or just to write things out. so this is my blog. nothing great. but its ok. what's up?   my back is getting better! not fast but its going to take a wicked long time for the nerves. its all bull shit. nerve damage is the bitch. so this is getting better...  but stuff gets worse at the same time. my FAVORITE teacher just told my sister that she wont be re-hired. i think somehow, someway she will be rehired. i have hope. i never have hope for anything and about this i do. i really do.   but the doctor says i can take walks and try to swim to get my back muscles going. good bye to "abs of steel" when school is out! i just need to wear it when im in pain.   leave a comment or a HI or what ever floats your boat. it doesnt matter  peace in -llama
