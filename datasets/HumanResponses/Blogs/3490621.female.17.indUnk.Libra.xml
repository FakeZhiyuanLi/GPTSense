      Considering what I posted last, whoever reads this is probably wondering or thinking I am this fucked up person that got beat as a child, or they pity me. I need no pity because those experiences taught me lessons in life, and they made me a stronger person. I am one of those people who think a lot because of it though. I'm always thinking why? But this is only going to be a short note. Hope all have a good day! ~Mel

      I sit and ponder over the things that have happened in my life. ~Flashback~ I sit on the side of a waterbed that my mother sleeps in. She had been working the night shift at wal-mart. I knew I was not disturbing her. I bent down to lace my shoes when a face peeked though the cracked door shedding light on my face.  "What are you doing?" I sat bent still tieing my shoe the other was untied as I hadn't gotten to it yet. "I'm tieing my shoes." I whispered as to not wake my mother.  "Do that out here." The woman whom I had come to know as my babysitter barked at me while my mother slept. My father and mother had recently gotten a divorce. (I was five at the time.) So innocent back then I did not realize what the foul woman had in store for me.  "I'm almost done." I whispered to her. She raised her voice slightly, "Do as your told, get out here now." I did not move, "One more second." She was about to say something else but I rose from the bed and made my way toward the door.  Once through the door she grasped my arm fiercely. I could feel my face grow hot and contorted into that of pain.  "Because you did not do as you were told, you will get punished. You could have woken your mother up, and we all know how hard she works." I knew not what punishment was then. I knew that I was quiet, I made sure that I was. I began squirming in her hands as she reached for her leather belt. My eyes widened and my breathing quickened. I do not recall when the pain started, but I do know that it did not stop until she was tired. My wails rang through my ears, and when she finally let me go I ran into the bathroom and locked myself in sobbing soundly and nearly choking in doing so.  It made no sense to me. Wasn't I screaming when she beat me? Didn't mother hear? Apparently not. ~End Flashback~ Days like this often happened, some worse than this. My father, my mother, they were the ones I loved, and loved being around. They weren't like these people who hurt me.  I did not tell my mother what had happened, not until many years later. Apparently the lady that had hurt me, my babysitter, was one of my mother's best friends. She entrusted that woman with me. She trusted her to keep me safe from harm. Although, the woman thought that her job was to keep me from other's harm. This did not include her, I suppose. That incident was a lesson well learned for later reference, when I will have children.  Other lessons learned in my lifetime also remind me that you should not entrust your own parents with your children.  ~Flashback~ It was a summer day, hot and slightly muggy outside. My aunt was over, my father was gone, and my grandfather was the one trusted to 'take care of us' until my father returned. My mother lived in another city, the one we had recently moved from.  "Get out there and pick up sticks." I heard my grandfather say to my little brother who was at the time roughly ten years old. It was odd of my grandfather to act the way he was acting but on through later years found that he always acted as he did under the influence of whiskey. "I don't feel so good." My brother said holding his stomach that slightly pooched out. I was a specter at this event and could clearly see that my brother was sick. I was thirteen at the time and knew when to stay out of things. My aunt sat on a couch and I leaned on a wall beside her watching what unfold in front of our eyes.  "I said get out there and pick up sticks!" My grandfather had raised his voice and I lent on the wall further in fear. My brother moaned in pain as he slowly rose from where he was sitting. "Get out there now!" By this time my grandfather had risen from where he was sitting, his metal cane in hand. He had surgery on one of his legs months before but still depended on the cane for support when ever he needed it. It was metallic silver with gray rubber on the end and gray plastic on the top for a comfortable grip. My brother walked slowly toward the door, but apparently not fast enough as the old man in his mid sixties caught up to the boy and roughly threw up to the ground at his feet. He raised his cane to hit, but my brother scrambled to his feet and ran out the front door. My grandfather went after him getting a few hits into my brothers flesh before saying. "If you keep running I'll beat you harder, I'll catch you one way or t'other."  My brother gave in and my grandfather beat my brother with his metal cane.  Through the days that came afterward, I did not see the damage if there was any on my brother's body that came from the cane. I kept silent for fear of getting beat. ~End Flashback~ These events are based on true events, but changed slightly because the memories within my mind have faded a bit.  This is merely a story from my life, and these actions are perfectly legal in the state in which I live, well back then it was, but thanks to some people in our government that has stopped. sayonara minna~san. (goodbye everyone.) ~Mel

      Hey whoever happens to be reading this! Well, I'll probably just be talking to myself again, but that's what you do when writing in a journal right? Well in a journal you write about crushes and such I suppose, but not here...But maybe who knows? Anyway it's summer. Actually it's been summer for me for about a week now or at least half a week. Yesterday I was trippin or something not all my posts here will be like American Hero. I just had to let off some steam. As I was saying, it's summer, and with summer comes summer goals.  Goal #1: lose some poundage so I can get some cute new clothes for my Senior year at Centerville High. Goal #2: possibly get a boyfriend? *blushes* heh...kinda already have that down. Goal #3: have some fun during summer for once! Most of summer I'm either watching TV or I'm sitting in front of my computer. My friends have vowed to get me out of my house, but no such luck yet. My parents are strict...Well not strict just assholes. Considering that I live with my grandfather, father, and little brother, my grandfather and father are the so called 'parents'. Just so happens that every child fights with one of his/her parents. I get along well with both my real parents, but the sub. parent, my grandfather is a diff. story. I HATE him with all my little black heart. I'm sure anyone would hate him after going through what I've went through, but enough of that crap.  Last years school year sucked ass, but at least I didn't get called devil this year. I was just sort of there, and so I'm sure I failed a few classes. That doesn't bother me though, it's that I didn't have any fun, at all...It just sort of sucked, and continued sucking. Although, I find myself already missing the horrible place. In conclusion about school, I want to have more fun. Maybe I need a personality adjustment for that though...*shrugs* Well that ends my rant for today. Sayonara minna~san! (good bye everyone!) ~Mel

      Hello to all those who happen to be reading this. On a more serious note, I am an American and to Americans there is the right to free speech. In this I would like to speak about the American Heroes out there. First, our troops are the REAL heroes. Not these idiots who get captured in Iraq, and somehow get free. The news claims these idiots who should not have been over there in the first place, American Heroes. This saddens me greatly for the REAL heroes are not getting any attention, but instead these wackos are getting the attention.  Everyone knows about the man who was captured and kept with Iraqis for a month or so. The news claims that he is a Hero...This makes me wonder. What did he do for the American cause? He got captured. Did that help us in any way what so ever? No. If anything it cost our American tax payers money. This brings me to Jessica Lynch, forgive me if I misspelled her name. She was the first woman POW. She got money, and a various assortment of things from the government and other organizations and so forth. Will the next woman POW be treated the same way? Will future women POWs receive the same attention? I think not. This peeves me to think of all the men POWs that received nothing.  Who are the real Heroes? Well, the news says it's the idiots who get captured and did nothing for the American cause, but I know the real Heroes are the ones who are fighting and getting shot and wounded for their country. In this I urge you to recognize the REAL Heroes. The ones getting their asses shot off. Have a nice day. ~Mel

      Well, it seems this is my first post on this thing my friends referred me to...Or rather told me about and it struck an interest of posting my thoughts online. I have a lot of thoughts and it only seems proper to post them online for everyone to see. Why proper you ask? B/c my thoughts deserve to be read and understood by others like me, and if you disagree with my thoughts, I have all the more reason to post more of what is on my mind. #1 thing on my mind as of right now: The election of 2004 and/or related issues As of yesterday I happened unto a chatroom downing Americans. I fully understood their points, but all they focused upon was America's bad issues. All countries have their good and bad points about them. No country is perfect as well as no person. This brings me to our President Bush. Our affairs with other countries has gone to utter shit. Excuse the language please, but it is the word that describes the state in which we are currently in. Other countries have changed their opinion about America and Americans ever since Pres. Bush came to power, and undoubtedly it is his fault. I'm not here to point out how bad our President is, but I believe he could have changed in order to appease our allies to at least side with us on some sort of level. I fear something will happen in the near future and it is not good for Americans. #2 thing on my mind: People's ignorance Yesterday while in that chatroom, the person downing Americans constantly said that Americans were stupid and ignorant. This ticked me obviously. Not all the people of one country are ignorant even though we, as a nation, have a higher drop out rate than countries like Japan and Russia. Like every country there is good and bad. There is no helping that b/c there will always be ignorant people who will refuse to hear the truth. Possibly they like being ignorant. I do not know and will not delve more into the subject. #3 thing on my mind: My life or lack thereof Well finally I can talk about myself. I am a seventeen year old female with long dark curly/wavy hair and blue eyes. I am five feet seven inches and I have a distant personality. Most of the time I am distant b/c I have been sheltered most of my life. My best friend is my computer, and as I sit here in the dark with the light from my monitor illuminating my figure, I know this is about as good as it's gonna get. I've never been kissed, although many a guy has tried to kiss me. Many of you who read this are probably thinking I'm pale and weird; spending most of my time reading things from online sources. On the contrary, I live on a farm with cows, and cow dung. I have four cats. I have a tan, although with a tan comes tan lines. I am not perfect, nor shall I ever be.  With all good things, there comes an end and to which I say Sayonara. Good Bye.  (P.S. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I'm just unleashing some pent up frustration...please forgive me if I do not get this blog thing right...*shrugs*) ~Mel

      I hate everyone and everything. I hate my life. I hate everything about my life. It sucks ass. Why do I hate my life? B/c I cant do anything, there is nothing I can do without getting yelled at. I cant have any fun nor go anywhere. More importantly I hate my grandfather. I hate him so much I cannot wait until he dies. Then I can have a party! And laugh at his funeral. I hate him with all of my being and hope he dies soon because I cannot stand anymore of his shit. Thank you and good day to all. ~Mel
