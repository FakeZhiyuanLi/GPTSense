      yesterday there is st john .. NDP rehearsel.. it was a real disappointment for mi ... as the sec 3 are going to take over st john soon right after 9 Aug... the sec 4 read out their plan for us.. mi ,wenhua,sidney and some others does not have a committe in st john.. which mean .. we are no different like e cadats .. being train.. and etc.. my frenz and i have always look forward to take over st john as NCOs.. can scold and teach at e same time.. but this would nv came true... most of e committe tt has assistant are given to the SEC 2 !!! why sec 2?!! some sec 3 dun even hv e position le y still gif to e sec 2 ? they still have 2 more yrs in BPGHS & St John lor.. we onli left with one yr and then gt to graduate le.. at first they said our squad too big ( 28 cadats) ... 8 person might not have post .. in another word is committe... now not e problem of not enuff of e post but is given to e sec 2 lor.. if all sec 3 are involve and then realli cant have everyone in e committe... i really have nth to said .. but now is different case lor.. i was wondering wat mdm yati & Mrs toh was doing... ask those tt is not serious to in charge of sec 1 .. fine lor..4get it... 3 yrs of faithfulness, 3 yrs of hardwork and tt's wat i get ... fine... forget it... one more thing i'm not happy is tt .. we still hv to under someone who is ur squadmate n hold e same rank as u to teach u footdrills... wat's this? Guan Pin rank is higher than her still gt to under her... guan pin was not realli very happy abt it lor... he was use to be from e CPBS dept. which means in charge of buying e ranks , apply for badge.. and now he end up b'come e treasurer... wat the hell e stupid st john is doing ?! 7 words to end my blog...   ST JOHN ARE GETTING SUX EVERY TRAINING!
