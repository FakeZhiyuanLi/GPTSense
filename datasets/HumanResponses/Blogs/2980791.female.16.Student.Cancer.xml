      Wake up every morning to the sound of the radio screaming &nbsp;6:30, 7:30, 8 o'clock and I got to leave  Walk out on the street with nothing on except the shame of last night  And a number in my hand of a man I don't really need  Where do I fit in  Where is my place here  What do I need to say, to make you&nbsp;want to here  Where do I fit in If she's in your bed  Where is my beautiful   Late night, long day, doesn't make much difference to me anyway  You called, I answered, but baby I'm only half awake  Hush little one with you here everything's going to be okay  Is all you say but what if things don't go that way   Where do I fit in  Where is my place here  What do I need to say, to make you&nbsp;want to here  Where do I fit in If she's in your bed  Where is my beautiful   It's over, we both know, we're both tired of playing the parts  I said goodbye, you said oh well nothing's really lost  Call every now and than just to hear your voice talk to me  You still say everything's alright but it's not and that's something you're too blind to see   Where do I fit in  Where is my place here  What do I need to say, to make you&nbsp;want to here  Where do I fit in If she's in your bed  Where is my beautiful    Where do I fit in  If she's in your bed  Where is my beautiful    [piano fades-song ends]

      The alarm startles me from my sleep, six am time to get up, time to face the world. First however I must face my fear, a fear that started a while ago. I wasn’t always fucked up, I used to be normal, used to hop right out of bed and face the day. That was before, that was prior to the incident that changed my life forever. I hit the snooze and receive 10 minutes of reprieve from facing my fear. Even in this place of safety and solitude, with the doctors who talk to me about my life prior to my incident, the Drugs that I swallow each day to help me sleep, to cope, to try and tell myself that what is under the bed is not real, I am not safe. The Doc here keeps telling me, what lives under MY bed has never done me harm, what is under my bed is a figment of my imagination. A manifestation of my own creation, a horror that I brought upon myself. But I am not crazy, I fucking know what lives under there, it is not a creation that I conjured up in my mind. The monster that is under my bed is real, I see it every fucking day.  &nbsp; Two snooze buttons later I have no choice, the nurse comes in “get up sleepy head, you have a 7 am appointment with Dr. Bumpus.” I really hate when she talks to me like I am a fucking idiot. They all do, in this place they talk down to you. The nurse leaves the room, they always do, there is never any witnesses to see the horror that lives under my bed. I move to the edge of the bed, and I hesitate, maybe today that thing will leave me be, maybe there will be peace. I lower my feet over the edge of the bed and place them on the floor. For a moment all is clear, all is quite, I start to feel relieved, calm. Perhaps this thing has been in my head, maybe I am as fucked up as the doctors say I am. Perhaps the talks and medication have helped me, I will be a normal person again. The creature extends its pale white limbs from under the bed, the arms are human long and thin. White, powdery and very dead, there is dried blood on the hands and arms. They outstretch towards my legs, I can smell the rotting flesh, the stink of death and hell is in the room. I want to move, I need to move, I know that if those arms grab my feet, it will be the end, I will cross over the line into full lunacy. I will be a raving fucking lunatic, I will pass the point of no return. I sit there trembling like a fucking school kid, not a man in his late thirties, a bead of sweat has formed on my forehead despite the air conditioned air of the hospital. I standup with all of my strength, and I run towards the bathroom door, I look back, the bloodied hands are still there reaching blindly for me, its nails scratching on the shiny white linoleum floor. I reach the bathroom, shut the door and lock it. Sitting down on the toilet I break down sobbing. Why is this creature tormenting me, what have I done to deserve this horror. Who the fuck is under my bed!. The nurse knocks on the bathroom door “come on silly, time to see the doctor.” Again with the baby talk, one of these days I grab her by the fucking hair and stuff her under the bed, then she will see that I am not crazy and there is something under my bed. “Well how are we doing today?” The Doc asks me in his talk to the idiot voice. “Have we had any episodes, today.” “No doctor WE didn’t have the episode, ME doc, I am one who was tortured by that fucking thing under the bed, and only me, none of your staff has the balls to stay in the room with me when the hands come.” The Doc starts babbling again about how this is all in my head, prescribes more meds and sends me back to my room. Well I will show the Doc and his fucking nurses. That I am not the one that is crazy, I will confront the hands and make them work to my advantage.  &nbsp; 6am, alarm sounds just like clockwork, however today I am not scared, I skipped the meds last night and I am ready to confront this thing under my bed. I jump out of bed and stand there, waiting for the hands. The hands come out, same as before, white, dead, bloody and stinking like shit. I grab the hands and yank the thing out from the under the bed. There in front of me is a dead woman, her head has been sunk in by a large blunt object. She is missing an eye, a black meaty hole is there in its place, the meat of her face is mostly gone, overcome by decay. I prop her up in the corner, sit down Indian style in front of her and ask “What the fuck are you doing under my bed?” She claims that she was my wife, I had murdered her and she is here to haunt me. Well that is crazy of course, I can’t remember being married, and if I was I think I could have found a woman that was a little more alive. However knowing that women can be quiet vindictive, her story was believable. Since I needed her help in getting rid of the Doc, I said I was sorry for killing her, and asked if we could just put the little murder incident behind us. After a few seconds of thinking she agrees, apparently living under my bed and trying to haunt me was not all that fun, she was getting tired of it and thought doing something else would be fun.  &nbsp; The reunion did have its catch, the dead thing under the bed who claims to be my wife wanted to renew the vows of marriage before she would help me deal with the Doc and his crew. Now strange as this might seem, fucking a dead, half rotted, stinky corpse was kind of erotic. However the fucking smell was killing me, I grabbed some femine spray from one of the nurses purses and sprayed the hose beast down. I let her start, she slipped my hard member into her toothless mouth. Not too bad, a little cold, but nice and smooth, I started to get into the action, when a cool thought popped into my head. I pulled my hard cock out of the things mouth and rammed it into the eyeless socket. Pumping furiously I skull fucked this bitch, something that is always threatened by over-powering bullies but never really accomplished. As I was skull fucking her a thought popped in my head, I remembered Billy from middle school, Billy was a large oafish looking guy, and the class bully. One day I cracked on him in class, the whole class thought it was funny, however Billy did not. I was walking home from school, cut through the woods, and ran into Billy. “Well you piece of shit, I will teach you to fuck with me”, he shoved me on the ground, torn down my pants and underwear, exposing my young hard buttocks, he pulled his pants down spit on his hand and lubed up his cock. He shoved his cock into my ass. I screamed in pain as he pumped away, tearing my asshole apart. He came in a loud heave and whispered in my ear, “if you tell anybody about this I will poke out yer eye and skull fuck you.” I never told anybody, hoping someday he would get his. A couple of years ago I read in the paper that Billy (who now was a high school gym teacher) never lost his favor for young boys, he was caught molesting a boy in the school gym shower, he was fired and was facing prosecution. Billy the fucking coward, sucked the end of his shotgun and blew his head off before they could send him to jail. “Well Billy, this skull fuck is for you!” I scream as I blew my load and fell back panting, feeling quite satisfied.  &nbsp; Apparently things weren’t over yet, the thing laid back on the floor, my essence dripping out of her blackened socket. She spread her legs with an audible crack and motioned me to come forward. Maggots and pieces of dead flesh dripped from her cunt . I was astounded to see that I was erect again, perhaps the Doc is right I am a little touched. I did my thing, sealing our pact with another load of my DNA. We waited for the nurse to come into the room, me in corner, my new found love under the bed. “Well whats the matter, did we have a bad episode again?” Again with that talk to the idiot voice. I stood up and said “No, no episode for me, but you will have your first and last right now!” I grabbed her by her greasy hair, I slammed her to the ground and dragged her screaming and kicking towards my bed, whispering “Who’s your daddy, bitch!” in her ear. Once I stuffed her head under the bed, my old lady took over, she grabbed the nurse and laid a big rotten toothless kiss on the nurse. The nurse recoiled in horror, vomited in my wife’s mouth and fainted from the excitement. “Oh did WE have a little episode today nurse” I ask my former nurse. The old lady props the nurse’s neck in between the bed frame and grabs the control. She lowers the bed until the nurse’s neck pops like a dried twig. “All around the mulberry bush, the monkey chased the weasel, the monkey thought it was all in fun, POP goes the weasel.” I sing as the nurse exhales her last breath and released her warm urine onto the floor. I stuff the nurse in the bathroom, my old lady crawls under the bed and again the trap is set. The Doc comes in “how are WE feeling today?” “Just dandy Doc” I reply ,”you know doc, how you say that all of this shit is in my head? There is nothing under my bed, that I am just a paranoid delusional man that needs therapy?” “Well that is putting it in simple terms, but yes, you need help” he replies with that fucking Smug Doctor look on his face. “Well Doc today I will show you something that might shed some light on my case.” “Really, well what is it?” he asks, in his talk to the idiot voice. “Come and look under the bed”, well the dumb fuck walks over and looks under the bed. My wife grabs him by his ears and lays a big wet kiss on his mouth, she thrust her rotted tongue into his mouth, he gags and vomits into hers ( I am beginning to think that my new wife enjoys eating others vomit, to eaches own I guess). She twisted his head around once, twice, three times a lady. The head separates from his body. “Who’s crazy now Doc, Who’s crazy now.” I ask him in MY talk to the idiot voice. &nbsp; &nbsp; It is the verdict of this court that the defendant is guilty of first degree murder of Dr William R. Bumpus and Natalie R. Charmus. However the evidence from the court appointed pychoristic shows that you are mentally unfit and should not be placed into a federal penitentiary. Therefore you are hereby sentenced to the maximum security behavioral facility, until you are mentally competent and then will be tried for these murders.    &nbsp; &nbsp;“Blah, Blah, Blah, is that the best you got Judge!”, I ask and I stand here and listen to this high and mighty in a black robe talk to me in his talk to an idiot voice. Who in the hell does he think he is, probably some pervert in his off time, lusting after young Nubian girls in their prepubescent phase. It is done, the man in the black robe slams the hammer on the table and the man with the gun leads me out of the room in my orange jumpsuit. I rather like Orange, and the jumpsuit thing is cool, but why did they not put a hatch in the back, it really sucks to have to pull the whole thing down to take a shit. Sometimes I shit in the suit, saves time and gets me a brand new orange suit. I am led to my new room, a new nurse gives me my Meds, seems like a lot more pills now. I down the meds and fall a sleep. I dream of my second honeymoon and hope for another go. It’s six am, I turn off the alarm, I slowly get out of bed and stand there looking down at my feet. I wonder if my wife knows my new address? &nbsp;  I write way to much fucked up shit.

      Today I made plans to go hang out with Toby. Except that my parents "need" to pick me up at about 9:00-9:30. WHY?! Why can they not leave me the fuck alone and trust me to take care of myself. I fucking hate it. I also hate how I'm aloud to do shit fuck all here at Aunt Liesas. I mean sure I love watching the girls, but I almost don't want to do anything at night because I don't get spend the amout of time I want to with my friends. I have to be in at this time and that time. Hello! I am more than fucking capable of taking the TTC. Oh worried I'm gonna get raped and stuffed in a trash can? FUCK YOU! Chances of that happening are slim to none. I know I have to respect that my Aunt has to get up for work...well then don't pick me up or wait for me to get home. GOD! HOw can it be I'm 16 years old and I have to abide by laws a 13 year old should.   I'm sick and tired of having to phone my parents everywhere I go. Oh it's to make sure I'm safe? Fuck that. I WILL BE OKAY! Michelle never calls her parents and she's still kicking.    FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!   I'm so angry right now.   Jenks.

      I hate blogger. You're probably wondering why I chose to make a new one. Well it's simple. On my old journal, the sidebar info did not show up. Mikki and I spent hours trying to figure out what the fuck was wrong with it. But to no avail. So I'm made a new one. Ain't it pretty?  In the mean time, Here are some pretty pictures.  My google search for Zombies/Dead People/Gross Stuff.     This makes me head hurt.    Mmmm.....isn't he/she a looker?    Haha, this makes me laugh.    Eww, that's disgusting. Lunch anyone?    So freah and so clean clean. ( the guy was killed in his bathroom, get the joke?)    Jesus Christ. OH man, I can't even think.    DROOLS    Hey baby, can I get your number?     I wish I could do that *sulks*]    This one is for you Mikki!     Holy Christ Wagons...this bitch is smokin'!    Okay, so I strayed a little. Oh screw it, you wanna look at nekkid ladies just as much as me. So now I'm gonna go look at porn.  I'm so out. Jenks
