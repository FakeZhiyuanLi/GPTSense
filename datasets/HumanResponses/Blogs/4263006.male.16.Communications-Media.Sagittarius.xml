      Ryan Anderson: im there... this is a lame blog... lol how long have you been updating? theres only like 2 posts lol Jeremy: I got it yesterday ^_^ Jeremy: I'm trying for user participation Ryan Anderson: oh, i see :) Ryan Anderson: dosnet that go against the deffinition of a blog? Jeremy: nope. Jeremy: not really Jeremy: just keep checking... watch it grow. Jeremy: it's coming. Wait for it... Ryan Anderson: lol Jeremy: as often as I rant and whine... it'll be massive in no time. Ryan Anderson: i dont care about you... lol :p Jeremy: lol I know.  Now  that's  some user participation.  Jeremy: but having a blog assumes that someone does Jeremy: I'm hoping it will be a self-fulfilling prophesy of sorts Ryan Anderson: you cant just say "hry, im a guy....   ...    .... Read my blog for no good reason..." Jeremy: I didn't. Did you... read... my blog? Ryan Anderson: you should do something.... Ryan Anderson: like say that you are the master of wearing odd hats... Ryan Anderson: "only time will tell" Ryan Anderson: yeah.  it will. it'll tell you YOU SUCK! :)   Time is a dick. What did I ever do to it? Okay, so ... I'm a guy. Read my blog fo no good reason. Did I mention I am the master of wearing odd hats? I am. I'll prove it. Look! Over there! I'm pointing that way!  Right. On to the good stuff. I'm going to be assembling a new PC soon. I have two questions... Nvidia or ATI, and what monitor should I get? For the monitor, I'm looking at around $200.  Do you ever post something online, and just watch your thread go to hell in a handbasket?  urlLink http://matrix.ogaming.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=10558

       Well, it seems that deviantART's journal feature just wasn't cutting it anymore.      That's right children, I have my very own blog! It's gonna' be kind of like my  urlLink Garblung , only more... bloggy. Hence, the GarBLOG. Now if only I had a GarBOT to cook my breakfast, I'd really be set.      Now the real question... why do I have my own blog? Only time will tell... and it seems like the strong silent type about this kind of thing. Not that I blame it.             So my girlfriend took me to the hospital (I don't want to talk about it, okay?), and while she was in the waiting room, she saw that they were selling flowers. These flowers were stored in a windowed refridgeration unit. Makes sense, right? Well, it did until she made a discovery... they were fake flowers. Why would you refridgerate fake flowers? People aren't THAT stupid, right? Right...?
