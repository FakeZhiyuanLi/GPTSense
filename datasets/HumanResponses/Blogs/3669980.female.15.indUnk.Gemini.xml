      Okay, so it's been a while since I've updated. So uhm, mom never said anything about him coming over after he did.  The rest of the week was spent doing VBS and just chillin.  Saturday I got to go out with Robert! :o) We went to eat and we were gettin out of the car and its the kind where the seatbelts go back when you shut the door. ((his car was being ghetto that day and had some accidents so we had to take another car)) And I didn't know that you had to open the door to get it to come off, so I was like "Robert, how does this work?" and he laughed at me and told me to open the door. haha! Then, we get in there to eat and I'm holding my menu and he says something and I flick the menu in one wrist to say something back and my menu goes flying like 5 feet away into the floor. Neither one of us ate much but we went back to his house and watched Peter Pan with his little sister and talked! Then we drove around for a while and he brought me home! It ended perfectly, but I don't kiss and tell! :-D

      Monday: I worked with the preschoolers at vacation bible school at my church and one kid licked my face! Eww! It was pretty gross! And this little girl named Lauren is really shy so I have to hold her hand or carry her all the time.  I don't mind though...she's adorable!  Today: Went and did the whole VBS thing again! whoo! Little kids are lots of fun! Robert got to come over, finally...however, uhm, my mom is kind of pissed about it because I didn't exactly ask if he could come over I just sorta handed her the phone so she could talk to Robert's step-mom about him coming over today...oops! :(  She said I was going to be "punished" for that one! Ugh, oh well...

      Well, I went to church this morning and got to talk to Stefanie! whoo! haven't talked to her in FOREVER! Then we went to my uncle's house for lunch. I got to see my cousin Eric who lives in New Mexico ((he comes during the summer)).  His voice changed over the year and he got taller.  Me and my mom got into a fight today...she said that I wasn't driving til I was 17, which is a load of crap. And then she decided to go and tell the rest of my family about how she didn't like the skirt I wore last night. So, uhm, I got ragged on about that.  Then I asked her if I could have Robert over to watch a movie tomorrow, and she said no because it was a "distraction" to her since she works at home.  Yeah, I definetly told him that he could come over...she can get over it. I plan on ignoring her for a while.  Well, I'm outtie...Laters!

      Got up around 10 today and had to get ready.  I went to Knoxville for a while with my mom to meet one of her friends for lunch.  It was kinda boring, but hey, I got pizza! :) LoL! Uhm, then I came home and got to talk to Jordan! whoo! [It's been a while since we talked.] We *might* go see Dodgeball tomorrow night if he gets out of his game early enough. whoo, fun! Again, I'm S.O.L. cause Robert's not gonna get to come over today either. Oh well, hopefully I'll get to see him soon. I'm out for now...laters!

      Today's been pretty boring.  I got up early to clean, thinking that Robert was going to get to come over...Yeah, that didn't happen. :o( Instead, my mother decided to bitch at me all day and say that she didn't want people in the house while she's working. And his parents are skeptical about him driving still...Oh well, he's suppose to call tonight and *hopefully* he'll get to come over tomorrow.  The better part of today--I went shopping and bought a hat! :o) it's pink and white and says "Bling Bling" lol! really funny part: I look good in it!
