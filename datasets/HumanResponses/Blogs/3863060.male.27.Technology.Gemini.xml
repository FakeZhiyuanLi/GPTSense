      Well i think i have made it into the top 50 of UK Geocachers. I will have to wait and see how it all shakes out after this weekend, as the weather is very nice and i expect most everyone will be out there giving it plenty. Will have to wait and see.    On Friday, I dragged Mark(friend from School) out with me to go on a bit of a geocaching adventure, he is a reluctant cacher, does not enjoy it, not sure why will have to ask him... anyway...  Went and finished off some the other caches i intended to do last sunday but never managed to, did most all in the area but one. The highlight of Fridays trip was the grave of the fifth Earl of Carnarvon who apparently discovered Tutankhamen's Tomb in 1922. I almost died climbing to the top of the hill wheezing something chronic...    Today I went back to that area again and finished off a couple more caches that i wasn't able to get to last night, and started finishing off the caches in west berkshire, got three or four more to do before i complete west berkshire, will save them for another day.     Have started to use another web browser Mozilla Firefox ( urlLink download it! ) It is an open source browser. and has some rather neat features in the downloading and watching of web pages department.    Watched Starsky and Hutch last night, was all Mark's idea, am quick to add, but actually did find some parts quite funny, which might be explained by half a bottle of wine.

      Not able to sleep late again... woke up at 07:00 (which for me&nbsp;is sleeping late). So with Jemma still sleeping i snuck into my "server room", to see if there were any new caches in my area, as it so happened there was... about 8 miles away as the crow flies, needless to say i was out the door by 07:30 and had the cache in hand by 08:00, first to find (my 5th), and&nbsp;back in time to have breakfast.  &nbsp;  Because Jemma was not busy working or doing her nails etc... she decided to come with on one of my little adventures, she is not as keen as i am, she likes to take things slow, I don't,&nbsp;so she tends to get left or dragged along the trail.&nbsp;I am going to have to get a couple of Garmin Rino's (they have the ability to let you know where in the world the other gps is, and is a two way radio too).  &nbsp;  Watership down and surrounds is a place i have wanted to visit for a while, and it was not far from home either, feels like a million miles away when you are there it is really picture book stuff.  &nbsp; A place that also deserves a mention is Ashley Warren, which has chickens and&nbsp;GUINEA FOWL running around!!! &nbsp;  Visited a few places mentioned in the book, "Nuthanger Farm", "Caesars Belt" and not to mention Watership down itself, all these places actually exist, which makes things quite weird.  &nbsp;  Will post some photo's hopefully they will be of a better quality as i took them with my digital camcorder.

      Well, today I set off on another of my geocaching escapades...  &nbsp; This time i decided that i wanted to go to Buckinghamshire, and as usual I had a couple of surprises. &nbsp; I woke up at 6:00, again, still can't sleep on weekends...  Left home at about 7:00 and found my first cache in Maidenhead 45 minutes later, good going by all accounts. &nbsp; My next statistical mission is to get into the top 50 of UK geocachers, am currently 60th so not too far to go, need to find 235 to get there (at the moment I have found 228, that includes todays finds) &nbsp; Anyways... worked my way north, into Buckinghamshire, the first 10 where "same old same old" caches in the usual setting, in lovely old forests or large meadows, which then brought me to a lovely village called Turville, which to my surprise is where they filmed an episode of "Midsomer Murders" and is the location of one of the vicar's house in "Vicar of Dibley", and most importantly is also the home of the Windmill in "Chitty Bang Bang", which is the home of the professor and his children, did take pictures which i will upload in due course. So I was suitably impressed. &nbsp; Found 13 in total today was absolutely Knackered as there where quite a steep hills. &nbsp; Bought the "Franz Ferdinand" CD which is quite good, been listening to it all day while driving between caches. Do recommend, if you like the likes of "Blur", that is... &nbsp; Signing off for now...

      Woke up at 06:00 on Saturday morning, I don't know why but for whatever reason I always wake up earlier on weekends.  Managed to get my 200th Cache in Oxford, went to quite a few nice parks and saw some of the touristy bits in and around Oxford.  The weather was less than desirable, was caught in about 3 torrential showers, the last was the worst, lasting for about 30 minutes and no where for me to go, was just praying that my PDA would not get wet, thankfully it didn't  Went to Iffley Road Track which is the track that Roger Bannister set the first sub 4 minute mile. Had the chariots of fire theme tune buzzing through my head for a while after...  Went into the Oxford Botanical Gardens which definately worth more than 2 minute fly by that i allowed for it. Is built on a Jewish Cemetry that ceased in 1290 (what ever that's supposed to mean)  One of the virtual caches was at a location where 3 men where burnt alive for there beliefs, didn't say what beliefs though.  Passed a lot of very old buildings not having a tour guide with me i really couldn't tell you what they were though. Will have to back and explore some more, i was on a bit of a mission.  My hands at the moment are a bit of a mess, they are full of spliters and thorns, will have to sit down to day and rectify that. No real surprise they are this condition after having to put them in numerous nooks and crannies.

      Been thinking about this all week!!  Tomorrow I am going hopefully find my 200th Geocache. Which means that I will hopefully join the " urlLink GeocacheUK .com Hall of Fame". Rather sad really but I am dead chuffed.  I have decide to get my 200th in Oxford, as it was the same place I got my 100th(Chester's Oxford Park #7) and I also have been itching to go back and finish the Chester's Oxford Park Series and University Challenge.   My plan of attack is to attack the ones on the outskirts by car, and then find parking in the center of Oxford, and knock off the rest in the series on foot. This shouldn't be a problem as last weekend I managed just over 24miles(about 36km??) on foot in London, and not to mention that I climbed both St Paul's and Monument a combined total of nearly 800 steps, so i think I am rather fit at the moment.  I am also hoping that tomorrow, I will break my record of "Most in a Day Record" of 18, which I set last Weekend.  Jemma(my fiance) is going to probably kill me this evening for the 4th day in a row iIhave forgotten to ask if two people at work are coming to our Wedding. My memory at the moment is of goldfish proportions. I think it is stress.  Oh... totally forget jem's going out tonight so I should be able to do a few caches today, am thinking of doing some around the Newbury area.   Work is rather stressful at the moment, I have so much work to do but I don't seem to have enough motivation to do it, it is not to say I am not doing anything, I am just not doing it as fast as I could.

      Well... It's been a while since I have had a run around the countryside so not much to report.  Been busy with wedding plans, and i am really starting to get nervous, as Dennis put it so elegantly last week there are "Min Dae". I just wish it was over already so that i can start saving money again, you really do not realise how expensive these things are until you have to pay for one...  Last weekend I was in Scotland, to pick up my kilt, actually looks very nice, well chuffed with it, the tartan is "McHardy Ancient". The tartan, which had to be specially woven, as it is not freely available, seemed to be a bit of a talking point as a few ladies were called into have a look when i tried it on, they were all in agreement that it looked very good. Also bought all the other goodies i.e. a wee dagger, shoes with incredibly long laces and my shirt and tie. My mom bought me my "badgers handbag" for christmas so... am pretty much all sorted now.  The shoes heels are a bit higher than i am used to so they hurt my arches, am wearing them now in the evenings to break them in...  This weekend i went into Town with Jem, her Mum and Shahir, the purpose of the trip was for me to buy Jem's Wedding Jewelry... so mission accomplished... Had a nice lunch at Nando's.  Miko, one of our cat's had three of her teeth out on Friday, so i will be taking her to the vet today for her post-op checkup. We have to give both cat's a seperate diet, will be speaking to the Vet today as it is a nightmare to administer, and we are getting woken up at 3am by hungry cats...  This evening we are going to also have a chat with our photographer, as to what he is piccies he is going to take and in what order, blah blah blah...  Only other news of any vague interest is that a new TV channel lauched today, called  urlLink NSAT , it will cater for all South African Ex-pats, showing South African TV shows, news and sport... one of the "highlights" is "Noot vir Noot", talk about fucking cringe factor. The only things i am looking forward to are the sports and news programmes. Somethings in my opinion should just stay in SA. But i suppose there is a demand as there are 1.4million expats in England, which i am not surprised by at all as virtually everywhere you go you hear South African accents, it is very scary...  anyway....
