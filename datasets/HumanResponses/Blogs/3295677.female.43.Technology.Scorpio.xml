      Look at your car lovingly, it's crying out to you ... "WASH ME!!! Pleasseeee???". So you look up at the skies, bright clear day ... no problem. And after mowing the entire lawn, FINALLY! (After the wonderful notice you found, "We can mow your lawn for $40, or you can do it yourself for free! By this date ____!! LOL!) You really don't seem to notice the sunburn you have, cuz your in too much pain otherwise. Well there's an hour of daylight left, what the heck? You decide to totally clean out the car, time for a "car spa". Go all out, after all wherever you need to go she takes ya! (It's a girl car, no attitude) Take it to the car wash, do the whole brush thing. Of course gotta have the "wax option", then topping it off with "spot rinse"! Wow what a difference, there's actually a color under all that dirt ... who would have known? Course then ya do the "shamy thing", no water spots a MUST! Woohooo new vaccumm machine, costs a quarter more but guaranteed to deep clean. Yeah, put the money in ... everything's going smoothly ... oh man, my shirt's getting sucked up .... PANIC! Take the top off? Yepp!!! Didn't see anyone around, have a sports bra underneath ... in the meantime fighting with the machine!!! Yelling at it to stop!! (yepp, it listened 3 1/2 min LATER) Ran outta quarter juice!!! Your too engrossed trying to hold onto the shirt so it doesn't get sucked in any more than it already is, hmmmm wonder how long those people have been there staring at me!!! Well, finally got the shirt out! By the way I wholly recommend that new vaccumm machine, it will suck ANYTHING!!! Just make sure there are no loose items within reach of the NOZZLE, body parts INCLUDED!!! Car is purring on the way home, "me soooo clean" .. the grill is smiling!!! Well, let's go one step further, detail the windows ... AHA how about the floormats? Yepp, throw them in the washer .. lil lazy ... sides no hose!!! So while your detailing the windows, you finally hear the washer ... uh oh!!! Yepp, RUN!!! I sat on the washer trying to hold it down, it finally gets done! Put the mats in the dryer, then go out to finish the windows! Kewl, how sparkly she looks! All gleaming ... well it's been awhile, go to check the floormats ... all dry!! Woohooooo ... just about done! Went to get the keys, floormats in hand ... guess what I walk out to? RAINNNNNNNNN!!! They never taught this in high school!!! We should really talk to the educational department about this! And here I thought, you had to do a dance around a campfire ... with a teepee involved! (no not toilet paper, a teepee ... kinda looks like a cone .. except upside down and no ice cream!)    I sooooooooo hope that your weekend has been as wild as mine has! Now go wash them cars!

           OK Ladies, Here is some more ammunition for you!&nbsp;  A man was sick and tired of going to work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed:  "Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home. I want her to know what I go through, so please allow her body to switch with mine for a day. Amen."    God, in his infinite wisdom, granted the man's wish. The next morning, sure enough, the man awoke as a woman. He arose, cooked breakfast for his mate, awakened the kids, set out their school clothes, fed them breakfast, packed their lunches, drove them to school, came home and picked up the dry cleaning, took it to the cleaners and stopped at the bank to make a deposit, went grocery shopping, Then drove home to put away the groceries, paid the bills and balanced the checkbook. He cleaned the cat's litter box and bathed the dog.   Then it was already 1 P.M. and he hurried to make the beds, do the laundry, vacuum, dust, and sweep and mop the kitchen floor. Ran to the school to pick up the kids and got into an argument with them on the way home. Set out milk and cookies and got the kids organized to do their homework.&nbsp;    Then set up the ironing board and watched TV while he did the ironing. At 4:30 he began peeling potatoes and washing vegetables for salad, breaded the pork chops and snapped fresh beans for supper.    After supper, he cleaned the kitchen, ran the dishwasher, folded laundry, bathed the kids, and put them to bed. At 9 P.M. he was exhausted and, though his daily chores weren't finished, he went to bed where he was expected to make love, which he managed to get through without complaint.    The next morning, he awoke and immediately knelt by the bed and said, “Lord, I don't know what I was thinking. I was so wrong to envy my wife's being able to stay home all day. Please, oh please, let us trade back."    The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied, "My son, I feel you have learned your lesson and I will be happy to change things back to the way they were. You'll just have to wait nine months, though. You&nbsp; …. got …. pregnant last night."

          A little girl had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful red haired, freckle faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. The kind of rain that gushes over the top of rain gutters, so much in a hurry to hit the earth it has no time to flow down the spout. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart.   We waited, some patiently, others irritated because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always mesmerized by rainfall. I got lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child came pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day.   The little voice was so sweet as it broke the hypnotic trance we were all caught in "Mom, let's run through the rain," she said.   "What?" Mom asked.   "Let's run through the rain!" She repeated.   "No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit," Mom replied.   This young child waited about another minute and repeated: "Mom, let's run through the rain,"  "We'll get soaked if we do," Mom said.   "No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning," the young girl said as she tugged at her Mom's arm.   This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?   "Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, 'If God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"   The entire crowd stopped dead silent. I swear you couldn't hear anything but the rain. We all stood silently. No one came or left in the next few minutes.   Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's life. A time when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith.   "Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If GOD let's us get wet, well maybe we just needed washing," Mom said.   Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they darted past the cars and yes, through the puddles. They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked. But they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars.   And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing.   Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories...So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories everyday. To everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven.   A friend sent this to me to remind me of life. Hope you enjoy it.   I HOPE YOU STILL TAKE THE TIME TO RUN THROUGH THE RAIN.   They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them. Send this to the people you'll never forget. It's a short message to let them know that you'll never forget them.   Take the time to live!!!   Keep in touch with your friends, you never know when you'll need each other -- and don't forget to run in the rain!   God makes everything but unbreakable hearts

      I never dreamed slowly cruising on my motorcycle through a residential neighborhood could be so incredibly dangerous! Little did I suspect.    I was on Brice Street - a very nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and slow traffic. As I passed an oncoming car, a brown furry missile shot out from under it and tumbled to a stop immediately in front of me.    It was a squirrel, and must have been trying to run across the road when it encountered the car. I really was not going very fast, but there was no time to brake or avoid it -- it was that close. I hate to run over animals, and I really hate it on a motorcycle, but a squirrel should pose no danger to me.  I barely had time to brace for the impact.  Animal lovers, never fear. Squirrels, I discovered, can take care of themselves!     Inches before impact, the squirrel flipped to his feet. He was standing on his hind legs and facing my oncoming Valkyrie with steadfast resolve in his beady little eyes.  His mouth opened, and at the last possible second, he screamed and leapt!  I am pretty sure the scream was squirrel for, "Bonzai!" or maybe, "Die you gravy-sucking, heathen scum!" The leap was nothing short of spectacular...  He shot straight up, flew over my windshield, and impacted me squarely in the chest. Instantly, he set upon me. If I did not know better, I would have sworn he brought 20 of his little buddies along for the attack.    Snarling, hissing, and tearing at my clothes, he was a frenzy of activity. As I was dressed only in a light T-shirt, summer riding gloves, and jeans this was a bit of a cause for concern. This furry little tornado was doing some damage!  Picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and leather gloves, puttering at maybe 25 mph down a quiet residential street, and in the fight of his life with a squirrel.  And losing...  I grabbed for him with my left hand. After a few misses, I finally managed to snag his tail. With all my strength, I flung the evil rodent off to the left of the bike, almost running into the right curb as I recoiled from the throw. That should have done it. The matter should have ended right there.  It really should have. The squirrel could have sailed into one of the pristinely kept yards and gone on about his business, and I could have headed home. No one would have been the wiser. But this was no ordinary squirrel. This was not even an ordinary angry squirrel. This was an EVIL MUTANT ATTACK SQUIRREL OF DEATH!   Somehow he caught my gloved finger with one of his little hands and, with the force of the throw, swung around and with a resounding thump and an amazing impact, he landed squarely on my BACK and resumed his rather antisocial and extremely distracting activities. He also managed to take my left glove with him! The situation was not improved. Not improved at all.  His attacks were continuing, and now I could not reach him. I was startled, to say the least. The combination of the force of the throw, only having one hand (the throttle hand) on the handlebars, and my jerking back unfortunately put a healthy twist through my right hand and into the throttle. A healthy twist on the throttle of a Valkyrie can only have one result.    Torque.    This is what the Valkyrie is made for, and she is very, very good at it.    The engine roared and the front wheel left the pavement.    The squirrel screamed in anger.    The Valkyrie screamed in ecstasy.    I screamed in  .. well .. I just plain screamed.  Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a slightly squirrel-torn t-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, and roaring at maybe 50 mph and rapidly accelerating down a quiet residential street on one wheel, with a demonic squirrel of death on his back.    The man and the squirrel are both screaming bloody murder.  With the sudden acceleration I was forced to put my other hand back on the handlebars and try to get control of the bike.  This was leaving the mutant squirrel to his own devices, but I really did not want to crash into somebody's tree, house, or parked car. Also, I had not yet figured out how to release the throttle... my brain was just simply overloaded. I did manage to mash the back brake, but it had little effect against the massive power of the big cruiser.  About this time the squirrel decided that I was not paying sufficient attention to this very serious battle (maybe he was an evil mutant NAZI attack squirrel of death), and he came around my neck and got INSIDE my full-face helmet with me.    As the faceplate closed part way, he began hissing in my face. I am quite sure my screaming changed intensity. It had little effect on the squirrel, however. The RPMs on the Dragon maxed out (since I was not bothering with shifting at the moment), so her front end started to drop.  Now picture a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a very raggedly torn T-shirt, wearing only one leather glove, roaring at probably 80 mph, still on one wheel, with a large puffy squirrel's tail sticking out of the mostly closed full-face helmet. By now the screams are probably getting a little hoarse.  Finally I got the upper hand ... I managed to grab his tail again, pulled him out of my helmet, and slung him to the left as hard as I could. This time it worked ... sort-of.  Spectacularly sort-of ...so to speak.  Picture a new scene. You are a cop. You and your partner have pulled off on a quiet residential street and parked with your windows down to do some paperwork. Suddenly a large man on a huge black and chrome cruiser, dressed in jeans, a torn T-shirt flapping in the breeze, and wearing only one leather glove, moving at probably 80 mph on one wheel, and screaming bloody murder roars by, and with all his strength throws a live squirrel grenade directly into your police car.  I heard screams.  They weren't mine...  I managed to get the big motorcycle under control and dropped the front wheel to the ground. I then used maximum braking and skidded to a stop in a cloud of tire smoke at the stop sign of a busy cross street. I would have  returned to 'fess up (and to get my glove back). I really would have. Really... Except for two things.  First, the cops did not seem interested or the slightest bit concerned about me at the moment. When I looked back, the doors on both sides of the patrol car were flung wide open. The cop from the passenger side was on his back, doing a crab walk into somebody's front yard, quickly moving away from the car. The cop who had been in the driver's seat was standing in the street ...... aiming a riot shotgun at his own police car.  So, the cops were not interested in me. They often insist to "let the professionals handle it" anyway.  That was one thing. The other?  Well, I could clearly see shredded and flying pieces of foam and upholstery from the back seat. But I could also swear I saw the squirrel in the back window, shaking his little fist at me. That is one dangerous squirrel. And now he has a patrol car. A somewhat shredded patrol car ... but it was all his.  I took a deep breath, turned on my turn-signal, made a gentle right turn off of Brice Street, and sedately left the neighborhood. I decided it was best to just buy myself a new pair of gloves. And a whole lot of Band-Aids.
