       Summer! Yess! But It can be boring sometimes, take now for instance! I can't do anything! I don't want to study either! *Ehm* Not my thing! I never do study! Except if it's a mastery test or a periodical test...! hehe! I love starcirclequest! Because it's a really cool reality show! Sometimes I wonder "I wanna join scq!"  People might think I am crazy but hey it's worth it! Also American-Idol! Go Jasmine Trias & Diana deGarmo! (ryt spelling?!) I'm also kinda scared of going to grade 7! New clasm8s and teachers! Augghhh! I TOTALLY MISS ZOBEL!!!!!!!!!!!!=(! I just watched TRIP KITA in Abs-cbn! hehehe! *To tell everyone the truth I am not a fan of Sandara Park of SCQ!* But for me she's kinda good in Comedy!  Now I am in Friendster.com and www.scq.cjb.net! well that's all for now folks!Ü

Also the beach in Currimao, Ilocos Norte....It's not white sand but the water is great! That's where I spend my whole 1 week! Ofcourse in Nipa Beach Resort! I Just love Ilocos! I mean the beaches!, Our shopping trips in Vigan, buzy streets of Laoag!, Fort Ilocandia(ryt spelling?) and a lot more memories just stored in my head!Ü

           Yess! Just wAtched trOy last niGht in rocKwell! It WaS reaLly ReaLly co0l actually! Hehe! Now I remember the happy memories I have when I was in DeLaSalle Zobel! I miss my friends there sooooo mucH! Actually not just my friends, I miss the whole school! I mean, the auditorium, the canteen!, the performing arts theater, the main building where I use to study! and the gyms! I miss being in Ayala Alabang and playing with my friends there! I just miss my school!=(! Not I am an incoming 7th grader in Colegio San Agustin. Where I studied for 1 year....It's not that I don't like it there! It's just the point of missing the people who u have spent 7 years with! I remember the times where I used to get caught in the fair!. Also the times that we watched theater shows in the performing arts theater! How could i forget the time that I have played a role in a school play! Now I am going to enter another school year! Just like last year! It seems that I am still not welcome here in csa! I just don't know why! But I hope I will be seeing my friends nd teachers really soon.................
