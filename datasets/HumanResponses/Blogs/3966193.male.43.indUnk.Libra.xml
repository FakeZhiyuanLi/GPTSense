						   "Who're you hiding from, Helen? The notices couldn't have been that bad"  Neely O'Hara    Went all day today reeking of Old Spice cologne. I swear I'm addicted to the stuff. I used to hate people like me. I work outside so it's not like I'm offending a big office full of people. I just like the smell of it. It sort of makes me randy. I love it when the wind blows around my head and I smell myself. I think they put something in it to get you hooked; like opium or something. There was a time when most of the men who used after-shave smelled of Old Spice.....the forties through the 1960's...that's a comfort, I suppose. Most men who wear Old Spice put on too much. Have you noticed this, too? Curious. I'm now one of them. I'm an Old Spice Man. I don't like the new logo they now put on the bottle. I like the old clipper ship from the old days. It was more masculine. Some things were not meant to be tampered with......a classic like Old Spice should be left intact. I'm sitting in my loft....it's hot up here......turned the A/C off but I think I should close the window and fire it up again.   Dack

						      "It wasn't easy to leave that wonderful old house. It was standing during the revolution. George Washington didn't dip a bucket of water from our well but he did pass us by. There was a scandalous rumor we were pro-British. I can still see them standing there waving; Mama, Aunt Amy and Willie. Poor Willie; he didn't know I was leaving his life forever. Oh, I wanted a marriage like Mom and Dad's but not yet. First I wanted new experiences, new faces, new surroundings. Lawrenceville would be there forever." &nbsp;  Anne Wells   Hot as all heck today. There's something wrong with&nbsp;the brugmansia. The trumpets don't hang upside down like they're supposed to.&nbsp; My solar lanterns are acting up. Don't you hate it when you buy something and can't find replacement parts for them? I mean not even the store that sells them can explain why they sell the fixtures but not the batteries that go with them. I got different batteries. They fit but they won't charge properly. They're nice lanterns, too. Pity. I've finally figured out all in this life is a racket. Everything is designed to separate&nbsp;you from your money. I feel a zit forming on the edge of my left cheek. Not my butt, my face, silly. It's very tender. I think I ate too many peanuts tonight. I'm sitting at my desk in nothing but white cotton Brooks Brothers boxers. I love Brooks Brothers. I'm such the man in my skivvies. Just like dad.   I've become all that I hate. It's true what they say. Complain about something and you've either done it yourself or you will someday. It's true, mark my words. Funny how I used to hate the smell of my father's Old Spice after-shave. Literally used to turn my stomach. Now I wear it myself and I like it. I've always detested the weakness in others. I have recently discovered my own weaknesses. I've always thought of myself as strong, callous to a degree and unaffected. Not true. I am as weak as all those I've rolled my eyes at over the years. I think God teaches us things like this to keep us in our rightfull places. It's only fitting and proper that He do this. I suspect this existence is a cleansing of some sort. I don't know&nbsp;for what purpose the cleansing occurs but there has to be one.&nbsp;  I'm one of those guys who, if given the chance in life, would do everything differently. I've made such a colossal mess of things. I just&nbsp;want to do one good thing for mankind before my time is up. Just one thing that would be of benefit to everyone. The light bulb is such a wonderful, yet simple invention. That's what I'd like to give to humanity; something simple, yet so totally wonderul and everlasting. Did&nbsp;you know Edison's first light bulb is&nbsp;still burning?&nbsp;This takes me back to my statement that everything is a racket. Light bulbs don't last any time at all these days. I want my contribution to be&nbsp;more "tamper resistant" than the electric light. Modern man has bastardized oleThomas's idea and is making a killing on selling his brain child. Everything is disposable.   It floors me how everyone seems to be obsessing on boobs and whiter teeth. Slutty famous people are a dime a dozen today. I was once an actor. Actors are very disposable. I was once driven to be famous. I lost the drive and was left jaded. For some reason, I have always wandered from one thing then another in search of something. I've never known what it is I've been seeking.   Dack

						   "You've got to climb Mt. Everest to reach the Valley of the Dolls. It's a brutal climb to reach that peak. You stand there, waiting for the rush of exhilaration but it doesn't come. You're alone and the feeling of loneliness is overpowering. I never meant to start that&nbsp;climb. I took the first step the day I left New England and headed for New York. Aunt Amy said it was a dreadful place for a vacation. I announced I was going to live there."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometimes movies run through my head. Today, in particular, ole Jackie Susann's "Valley" just wouldn't leave my brain. I often quote Neely O'Hara. "Who's stoned?" Sometimes I sing like Connie Francis. I am not a fan of hers in particular. I like to ramble incessantly. I often don't get enough sleep. I am trapped in a time warp. I adore the 1960's. I wear too much Old Spice cologne. It smells pretty good on me, actually. I don't much care what others think of it. I love skinny black neckties with white button down shirts. Right now I should be in bed. My thoughts are scrambled......can't focus. What's it all about, Alfie? Splain it to me, Lucy. Got to get off, gonna get, have to get on where I'm bound. Will it help to write all this crap down?  &nbsp;  Dack
