       ive got to trust life. ive got to trust that i will land a good job paying me at least £300 take home a week. that i will be able to save up £100 a week for my trip to oz. ive got to trust that i will find a place to live with my cat that wont cost too much, and that i will find a cool bar job.  i was thinking today that maybe i can get a student visa to stay in oz at the end of my year there if i want to stay. maybe i can study marine conservation.  part of me also wants to go to california on a student visa and study dance. wenever i see music videos or people performing with dancers, i get a craving to learn, but i want to go to the best place to learn. i would love to dance in a janet jackson video, but that must take years of studying and a hell of a lot of competition.  im going to download a beaches screensaver to keep me motivated. sometimes i feel i am motivationally disadvantaged...

        phew!&nbsp; well ive been going through all my stuff getting it sorted for wen i move and it feels so good to get rid of most of what i have.&nbsp; this year has really been a cleansing, simplyfying year.&nbsp; i got rid of stuff wen i went to work with the horses, and now im getting rid of more stuff now that i know im going travelling.&nbsp; im a bit peeved that i will hav to leave some stuff with my mom as i didnt want to have any posessions other than what i need, but i have thousands of photographs and photo albums, blasted friends... :D&nbsp;      &nbsp;  just my frikkin luck.&nbsp; from listing 120 items on ebay, i now owe ebay £72 which is exactly how much ive made so far on the items!&nbsp; fuxake.&nbsp; well at least im getting rid of the stuff.    &nbsp;  ive been looking for a room to rent in chiswick/hammersmith and ive applied for two typist jobs and put my cv on totaljobs and letstemp.&nbsp; next week im going to go to agencies and hand in my cv, i need to use this weekend to buy office clothes!&nbsp;     &nbsp;  im so amped!&nbsp; i cant wait to be working again and earning and saving up and planning my trip.&nbsp; i cant wait to book the flight!&nbsp; i need to buy as much as i can before my birthday in feb tho, cos wen im 26 i dont get young persons discounts.    &nbsp;  i really want to go to oz with my own £2000 which is what i need to get the working holiday visa.&nbsp; id like to do a bit of conservation volunteering while im out there.    &nbsp;  wen i get back from oz, depending on how things are, i reckon im gonna keep going to countries to work for as long as i can.&nbsp; like if you can only work in america for 3 months, ill go to florida and work there.&nbsp; i want to see the world before i settle down and i want to marry a professional surfer and raise my kids on the beach.&nbsp; i belong by the sea and thats where im going :)

       so i had a bit of a freak out this week and ive left stringfellows.&nbsp; i had a panic attack two nights in a row and i just had enough.&nbsp; im moving back to london and am presently looking for an office job so that i can save up for my year in oz.&nbsp; i worked out that if i save £100 a week for 5 months, i will have £2000 which is what i need to go to oz.&nbsp; if i can get a job taking home £300 a week like i had in my last office job, i can set up a direct debit every friday to put £100 into a savings account and live on the rest.&nbsp; i dont care if i hav to eat soup and bread for 5 months but i am going to australia for a year next year.&nbsp; i also have to pay back the £1000 loan my mother has taken out for me and buy a flight to oz.&nbsp; maybe ill fly in february for my 26th birthday.    im going to sell my crashed car to my mechanic and sell the other one once im settled in london.&nbsp; and just keep getting rid of stuff i own until i hav very little.&nbsp; tamlyn at work has a bed available at her house for £74 a week sharing the room with another girl in fulham, the house with 3 other girls.&nbsp; its cheap and cheerful so if mom will let me use part of the loan to pay for the deposit, then ill move in there.&nbsp; then at least i wont hav to pay too high travel costs or spend too long travelling.&nbsp;    im looking for a copy typist job so i just have to sit in the corner and type and watch the money come in.&nbsp; im going to be so disciplined.&nbsp; no clothes shopping, no nothing.&nbsp; my goal is to go to oz on my own back and for that i need to save as much as possible.    i reckon ill get a part time evening bar job to bring in some extra cash, maybe two or 3 nights a week.    i feel positive.&nbsp; for the first time in a long time.&nbsp; im gonna go to the sun and the sea and be a surfer chick for a year and then take it from there :)

       so ive been thinking about this.&nbsp; for me to be able to stick to the rules, im gonna hav to hav some money to fall back on for those places and times i cant work.&nbsp; so im gonna see if i can get a credit card before i go.&nbsp; then atleast i wont hav to worry about being stranded in a country that doesnt speak english.    &nbsp;  part of me wants to get a bar job here in the uk cos i hate stripping, but id be making even less money.&nbsp; then again, at least i wont hav to pay the bar to work there!

       ive been researching on the internet to see what work is available in the countries i want to go to.&nbsp; it seems i wont be able to work in fiji, but i can get a short stay visa for oz which means i can do a month in oz and pop over to fiji for a couple days.    &nbsp;  there are jobs in greece so im going to include greece.&nbsp; for some reason i dont want to do italy, not sure why, even tho i should really go over and visit victor.&nbsp; maybe ill stop over at him if i can.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  im going to try and stick to bar work and dancing work (either nightclub or strip club) so that i have the daytime to explore the place im in.    &nbsp;  im also thinking of doing a bar job in a ski resort this winter, just for something different to do, and im sure ill meet some really wicked people.&nbsp; then again, i cant go anywhere till ive got my british passport. bugger! i keep forgetting about that...

       so part of me last night was thinking that maybe i should just go to oz for a year.&nbsp; i guess cos this plan seems easier.&nbsp; i mean i havent made it easy for me.&nbsp; 12 beaches in 12 months, and working my way around, it seems the great cosmos of the universe doesnt work that way, it seems you have to pay your way around without working.&nbsp; i dont know, i have to speak to the professionalls like sta travel and see what they think of my plan and if its possible.&nbsp; im just thinking about money.&nbsp; i am going to go travelling, but i dont think i can afford it if i dont work.&nbsp; then again, i need money to get a visa for oz...&nbsp; money, its always my achilles heel.   i have to go tho, more than i want to go, i need to go.

       hi and welcome to my travel diary.&nbsp; ok so i dont start travelling for a while yet, but im so excited making my plans that i thought id start it now.&nbsp; think if this as the introduction to the story.    &nbsp;  ive been trying to figure out what to do with my life and not enjoying the one i have very much, so i asked myself what id really love.&nbsp; i decided i wanted to spend and entire year in summertime and to make it exciting i would travel around the world to stay within 20-25 degrees celcius.&nbsp; from this came the idea of  twelve beaches in twelve months.       &nbsp;  as it stands, i have no savings and no rich family to back me on this.&nbsp; i work as an exotic dancer at stringfellows in central london.&nbsp; i dont enjoy the job and dont make much money from it.&nbsp; i find it very exhausting and often get a headcold or throat infection doing it.&nbsp; BUT i do it because i dont want a normal 9-5 office job.&nbsp; ive been there and i wont go there again, it just isnt me.&nbsp; i like that i can do whatever i please with my days and sleep as much as i want.&nbsp; sometimes i do a photoshoot for a photographer to keep me entertained and if i can be bothered, i go to the gym, but mostly, i sleep and recouperate.    &nbsp;  i dream of being a surfer chick with a job in a bar or a seaside restaurant.&nbsp; maybe its because my happiest days were wen i was still in school with a weekend job at a seaside restaurant on my favourite beach where i could watch the guys surfing and flirt with them too.&nbsp; i mustve been 14, but i loved that freedom and i want that in my life.&nbsp; i hate answering to people and doing as im told.&nbsp; i like to have no ties and be able to come and go as i please (its a wonder my cat doesnt recognise me half the time...)    &nbsp;  wen i watch surfing programs, i envy their life.&nbsp; waking up, surfing all day, in the sunshine, being active, feeling passionate about the ocean and nature, not having any ties, that feels right to me, it fits me.    &nbsp;  so, since i havent travelled much (ibiza, florence, amsterdam & graz) ive decided to embark on a world beach tour.&nbsp; twelve beaches in twelve months.    &nbsp;  at present i dont hold a british passport, but i am hoping to get one after i become naturalised in the next six months. (see my profile for my background).&nbsp; once i have that, i will start to buy flights and make serious steps.&nbsp; for the present, i am planning my route and preparing for the day i leave.    &nbsp;  so far, i have decided to include france (biarritz), the canary islands (lanzarote), portugal (the algarve), spain (andalucia), south africa (jefferys bay), fiji, hawaii, california and florida.&nbsp; i may go to thailand and mauritius but it depends on if they can sustain my rules.    &nbsp;    stay within summer throughout my trip    work my way round    stay on popular surfing beaches     i have been looking at global surfing websites to find out which are the best and most popular surfing beaches around the world.&nbsp; mauritius and thailand dont come up and im missing out australia so that i can get a year long working visa after ive done my trip.&nbsp; (they only allow you one working visa in your lifetime and i want to give australia my full attention).    i now have to find out if i can work in each country, what visa's ill need and to plan my routes so as to stay within summertime.&nbsp; im pretty much willing to wing it if i can, but im also very much aware that i wont have much money to begin with as i dont want to take out a loan as i dont want any ties wen i go.    ive started to sell as much stuff that i own on ebay.&nbsp; obviously my car and my computer will be the last to go.&nbsp; the only thing i need to buy for my trip is a good digital camera and a good suitcase to put it in.&nbsp; im planning on taking a pair of flipflops, a bikini, black skirt and black shirt.&nbsp; white shirt, couple t shirts, hat, and sunglasses and thats it.&nbsp; i like the idea of owning very little.    things like photographs and very sentimental items will be put into storage here in the UK if i cant leave them with my mom.    oh and i need to find a home for my cat.&nbsp; he is very low maintenance, you feed him and he sleeps.&nbsp;     so this is the beginning of the beginning.&nbsp; ive already started the ball rolling by selling as much of what i own as possible and giving what wont sell to charity.&nbsp; im excited.&nbsp; im excited to see what life will bring me, what i will learn and how i will grow.&nbsp; im excited to do something with my life that i am sure will benefit me and more than anything i am excited for the opportunity to sort my head out so that i can go into adult life more stable and secure.    wish me luck! :)

       ive been offered to go to an audition to be a nightclub dancer. problem is, i want to do week nights so i can keep my job at pop. i mean i dont hav to keep my job at pop i guess, but i would hav to be gauranteed regular work if i was to go for the dancing insted of pop. shane tells me you can get £170 for 3 sets a night in london, way more than i thought you got. id rather dance fri and sat nights for £100 each and get an extra £200 a week than £100 a week. i just hope i can do it as im way unfit for such strenuous activity! but itll be good, i can lose weight, tone up and get back into it so im ready for sydney.  im gonna want to rent a place as soon as i can wen i get to sydney. im going to work on getting contacts of clubs and promoters out there before i go and see if i can secure a dancing job to start wen i get there, then i can focus on finding a place to rent. i suppose i could just stay in a hostel till ive found both too. but i am going on my own so its going to be hard work. then again, ive done it all before wen i came to london and at least ive learned from mistakes i made in london so sydney should be successful :) im so excited about going to sydney and doing what i want to do because im older and wiser now.  ive been doing a spreadsheet of how much i can save over the next 5 months. ive been trying to find cheap flights too. im gonna hav to liv on popcorn and soup cos i need to save up like £3000. i was gonna save £700 a month but i hav to pay my mom back the £1000 loan she took out for me so thats £200 a month (£50 a week) which means i will only be able to put aside £500 a month to save, leaving me £50 a week to liv on which will be really hard. still, to be in sydney and hav some decent money to liv on while i find a job and a place to rent will be good and i hav to keep reminding myself of that. im going to stick a list of my expenses and how much i need to save up in my new room to keep reminding me to save save save.   im also motivated by never wanting to fail myself again.  the feeling of disappointment is the worst feeling i know and to do it to yourself is even worse.  its exciting to feel this incredible sense of determination and motivation, something i hav lacked for five years. the last time i felt this way was wen i wanted to come to london to be a dancer. i guess once i decide i really want something, i go for it and nothing will stop me. once i feel no fear im unstoppable. that is the key, i need to master overcoming my fears or else i will never succeed. ask yourself:  if nothing could go wrong, what would you do?  and do it as tho nothing will go wrong.  moving from stripping back into normal life has taught me something valuable. it has taught me to  trust life.  to trust that life will bring me what i need, if i just relax and be patient and trust that it will come in it's own good time, it will save me a lot of stress and worry. ive learned that i hav been far too impatient for my own good. always wanting everything i want to happen right now. i panicked wen i left strings. i had no money, no job prospects, nowhere to liv, no idea what to do. i decided to go to oz once i get my british passport and to do that i would need a well paying job close to a cheap place to liv. i wanted it all in a week but i had to wait 2 or 3 weeks for it all to come together and now i have a well paying 9-5 that costs me £9.50 a week to get to because i rent a 65pw all incl. room. everything has come together because i decided to trust that life will bring me what i want and stop trying to control everything which just caused me incedible stress and anxiety. the same thing has happened with david. ive let things happen in their own time, and because of that, ive had the time to enjoy it cos im not trying to control every step which eats up my concentration and ability to relax and enjoy. reading the book  surrendered single  was one of the best thing i did. ive seen the benefits of letting go of control and feel more relaxed and able to focus than before. maybe its just because im back on the st johns wort  (natural anti depressant herb)  hahahaha!

      it has become blindingly obvious that i do not belong in a conventional, formal, lifestyle.  so how the hell did i get here?  i have 6 years experience as an office administrator/database manager ffs!  i should be a dancer.  i should be dancing in music videos and travelling the world as a back up dancer with someone.  going to auditions and training and wearing casual clothes and having something to say and spending time with energetic, interesting, creative people.   i should not be wearing grey pinstripe trousers, pale pink v neck jumper and pointed flats while sitting in front of a computer inputting data into a database, feeling my ass grow at the speed that i type.  yesterday i went to pineapple so shane could give me the numbers of a bunch of dance agencies so i could get work as a dancer and sitting there with all the other dancers, listening to them talk about auditions theyd been to that day, i was like, what the fucking hell am i doing!?!?!?  mom says, just keep thinking about the money and yes thats all very well and good, but i can feel my soul shrinking and cowering like a small abused child inside my heart because im doing something that goes against everything that i am.  the reason ive always been crap at office jobs and for six years havent moved anywhere in the office career environment is because i dont actually care.  i really dont car about implementation and facilitation and efficiency and communication and blah blah fucking blah.  and because i dont care, i dont try and so i dont succeed.  but at least now i know why and i know i dont belong here.  i cannot fucking wait to get out of this city, out of these work clothes, out of office life.  i cannot wait to get some tattoos and get on with the life i am supposed to be living.  im sorry i have waisted so much of my time, really really sorry.  just think where i could be now if i stuck with my plan and studied dance from the day i got here 5 years ago.  i could cry thinking about it.  i fucked up big time.  i wont anymore.  i just wish it didnt take me 5yrs to realise where i belong.

      so i worked out that 6 months is 26 weeks and £100 every week for 26 weeks is obviously £2600. £150 x 26 = £3900 and £200 x 26 = £5200. What fantastic motivation to save money! My bus pass to get to work costs me £9.50 per week which saves me loads. Wen my car is fixed i will sell it and cancel its insurance, AA and tax, saving me more. I wish i could stay with mom so i could save on rent too but i need my own place and i need my pc back online. Just found out i cant check my hotmail here at work and am worried ive got angry ebay people on my back about their items. i cannot wait till that is over, i will never sell anything on ebay again! youd think i was selling gold insted of second hand items ffs!  anyway, i hav signed the contract for this new job and will be here till Friday 14th January. Thats 22 weeks. £100 a week for 22 weeks is £2200. I clearly need to try and put away more than that a week. if i put £150 away each week, its £3300.  if anyone is reading this, my email at work is:  urlLink lisa.walton@saffery.com   i cant access my hotmail here so please email me at work NICKIE :) x x x  also i dont know what any of your email addresses are without access to my hotmail so would help if ya email me :)  ive been reading a guide book on oz and ive found so many places i want to go. i want to visit katoomba in the blue mountains and of course nimbin which is like little amsterdam as its legal to smoke weed. and then of course byron bay, surfers paradise and brisbane, incl fraser island and the whitsundays. i want to go snorkelling and hang gliding and swim with dolphins and learn how to surf. ive got a whole year out there and i dont know what to do with all that time. i want to visit fiji, tahiti and the cook islands too. ive decided to do hawaii on my way to sydney from america as its on that route. im eager to find people who have been out there who can give me great places to visit and things to do. ive already got a list of clubs in the main cities to approach about dance and promotion work.  anyway, this job is ok. of course id rather not do it, but its something in the least. one of the promoters of sintilate at pop has offered to help me get dancing work here in the UK as well as modelling work. but now that i hav an office job i wont be able to do any modelling as i wont hav the time. he also teaches a class at pineapple on mondays and wednesdays so im going to take up classes insted of gym as i work round the corner from pineapple now, i can go after work.  i met beverly knight and her lush boyfriend on friday night, as well as the black guy who presents top of the pops, redge and the little white guy who sells big mo dodgy stuff in eastenders. i also met zara phillips and her england rugby player boyfriend on saturday night. her boyfriend was trying to say he wasnt a rugby player, saying he's too pretty to be one and i said well maybe he doesnt play the game properly hehe!  proper fancy two guys at my work, one is ozzie and the other is saffie but they both hav girlfriends of course. still, i should behave as things are going well with me and david, even tho we havent kissed properly hehe. i kinda like how he hasnt tried it on with me yet, it shows he likes me for me and not for stuff boys want, but its also quite frustrating! we have been out 4 times as it is! and i got snogged at work on saturday by this cute boy called ross who is from bristol, wasnt expecting that lol. every night i work, someone gives me their number. it finally dawned on me, men  are  in fact running after me, but none of them are anyone i want so i dont even notice and thats why im always thinking im a loser! i also quite like shane the promoter of sintilate. he is a lot older than me, but he doesnt wear a ring and i feel so relaxed and comfortable around him. he sent me a really nice text msg and im going to see him at pineapple after work to talk about agencies and stuff.  totally gutted im gonna miss porly's 30th. the other guy who works the VIP room with me is away in ibiza on the 28th so i cant take the night off. i could go after work, but that would mean getting to erol's at like 5 in the morning wen everyone will be well on their way, or coming down. havent told porly yet, reckon ill go anyway just to see everyone. had to miss gav's birthday party in oxford on sat night too, was gutted about that as well :(

      well i went for an interview for that database executive job yesterday and they offered me the job today.  its working at the chartered accountants Saffry Champnese (yawn).  But its £11 an hour and im gonna work 9-6 and i have my job at pop which is about £50 a week too, so i should be making around £400 a week which will help me pay off my overdraft and save up for oz quite easily. today i also went to apply to retain my south african citizenship so that wen i apply to become a naturalised british citizen, SA wont say im not one of them anymore.  am trying to decide wether to wit till ive gone to majorca or to just go ahead with the naturalisation application.  i need proof of flights and accom to apply for a visa to majorca and im not sure i can get them from david. i have been reading a book on australia.  there is so so so much to do out there!  while im there i want to learn how to surf and do some koala conservation work and go snorkelling and i want to visit fiji, the cook islands, bali and hawaii if i can. im planning on doing nightclub dancing and promotion in sydney first and then bar work in wherever i go to.  looks like i will go out in the beginning of march now as feb is still peak season and i think i will only finish this job in feb.  i still have to apply for my british citizenship and passport before i can even apply for the working holiday visa to oz and i hav to save up for the flight. so at least now ive got two jobs and my car is being repaired and ive applied to retain my SA citizenship, so i feel better now.  i was frustrated that nothing was moving, i felt like i wasnt on my way to saving up for oz, but i do now.  all i hav to do now is find somewhere to live.  im looking for something in west london for around £80-£85 a week.  looks like ill be sharing a room with someone at that price but i cant share my moms bed much longer, i need my space and i need my pc back online cos wen i cant sleep at night, i like to surf the net till im tired but at my moms i just toss and turn. anyway, the next 5 months are going to fly by, its already the middle of august!  i cant wait to get on that plane to miami, on my way to sydney.  im going to go via america first :)

      good news: was woken up this morning by who i thought was another agency wanting me to register, but in fact was the company at which i applied for a database executive job.  they want me to go to an interview on thursday at 2pm.   bad news: i am £63 over my overdraft limit thanks to direct line and my mobile phone insurance. grrr!  i still havent paid my phone bill either.  all the money mom has given me has gone to paying for the posting of the items i sold on ebay.  and oh god hav i had no end of shit from people on ebay.  this guy bought an ecstacy book from me and it never reached him and i cldnt afford to refund him the £2.20 so he threw a massive strop.  then i forgot to mention that this one item's postage would be notified after auction end.  so this chick is refusing to pay the extra £6 for the postage of a portable clothing rail!  for fuxake people give me a fucking break!  wen will people learn that the world does not in fact revolve around them!?  am taking st johns wort to help with my mood but am feelin extra tetchy today.  i think sharing a room with my mom is starting to get to me.  its very cramped and i need to find a place to live.  i also hav no money and wont get paid for the weekends work till next week i think. but david has invited me to go to a westham game with him this afternoon so that will be cool and i have accepted his invitation to go to majorca with him in september cos i need a holiday and i like him.  he is playing a tornament out there over a weekend so all expenses paid, which is nice :)  went into flightcentre yesterday to get a quote for a flight to oz in feb and she said £700 and something.  but i saw a flight via miami and los angeles to sydney in the TNT magazine for about £400, so im gonna do that insted.  spend a month in the US first before i hit oz for a year :)  bugger, my time is up again on this pc.  off to go find me somewhere to live :)

      right, so life has been a bit hectic this past week. managed to arrange for my mechanic to take my car to his yard and repair it.  he may not need to use my GT for parts which means i can sell it and use the money towards the repairs of my diesel.  once my diesel is repaired i will sell that too for money. have started working as a cocktail waitress in the VIP area at POP in soho on friday and saturday nights.  5 pounds an hour plus tips and im not doing so well with the tips.  i guess i feel weird as i should be the people in the VIP area not the one serving them.  on saturday night i met one of the promoters of a night there and he teaches a dance class at pineapple, he is keen for me to go down and take his class and so am i.  if i train now, i can get work as a club dancer in oz.  he also had a girl there who was taking pictures of the night and getting people to sign up for their mailing list.  im going to speak to him about doing that job for a promoter he knows if i can, then i can do that in oz too cos i will hav experience and its another night job, leaving my days free and making my socialising free too. this guy suggested i become a dominatrix to earn money for my travels as he reckons i didnt like stripping cos im not naturally submissive to men.  its an idea, but id hav to research it a lot first and find out whats really involved.  but if it means i dont hav to be naked and i dont hav to to do anything too weird then i might look into it for a laugh and a good way of making money! haha! mind you, id probably get fits of giggles everytime i hit someone.  on the other hand, i can be quite rough with my boyfriends... hmmm hehehe am thinking about postponing my naturalisation application as i have been invited on two expenses paid holidays in september.  one with a dancer friend to tenerife and one with my tennis player to majorca.  i really need a holiday and everytime ive been on holiday its been expenses paid and in september.  every single year ive been in the uk, apart from wen nickie and i went to amsterdam last year.  how weird is that? i am missing my friends so much.  puppy and sniff keep asking me out for a girls night out and i havent spoken to nickie in so long. i just cant wait to get a job and somewhere to live and then i will be on my way to saving up for australia. dammit ive only got 2mins left on this library pc and then i have to go and post a million one ebay items cos they are sending me emails wanting their stuff.  will hopefully be back online later today, missing my pc like a missing left arm... to anyone who is reading this, missing you all loads, hopefully will be back in the land of the living soon x x x

       well today i have left a msg at the agency i was with wen i last had an office job.  ive also sent my cv to another agency and updated my cv on another agency's website.  i also applied for a database executive job.      ive also managed to sort out my crashed car.  my mechanic is going to keep it till he gets back from holiday and then he is going to repair it and he may not need my new car to use for parts which means i can sell it on ebay and use the money to pay for the repair of the crashed one.  once the crashed one has been repaired im going to sell it too so i can cut down on costs such as AA, car insurance, tax and parking.  i dont need a car in london so id rather not pay for one.      and thanks to my friend nick, i transfered £200 from my paypal account from all the stuff i sold on ebay into my bank account which should take up to a week and didnt buy a digital camera like i was planning.  obviously im still having some self control problems :D  im also pleased to say the £200 was left over after i paid ebay nearly £100 in fees!      i called about a room in chiswick but shes not sure i can hav a cat altho there is a catflap in their back door, so im holding thumbs as its only £80pw plus about £10 a week for bills, sharing with two others.      i called the bank too and they told me that i can ask the bank to transfer my overdraft into a loan so i can pay it off in monthly installments.  i am so pleased, i didnt even know you could do that!  so im going to pay off £100 for the next four months.  i really could do with starting an office job ASAP tho.  im working this weekend at pop but thats just £50 plus any tips i get and a cut of the service charges.  i hope i get some good tips!      mommy put money in my account so my car insurance was able to get paid, i still have to pay my phone bill tho but i dont feel as bad as i did yesterday, yesterday was not fun.

      well after a good sleep i feel stronger and ive put my wheels back on the track and im gonna keep going.  i am supposed to go for training at ruby blue in leicester square today at 2pm but im in essex picking up my pc and my cat and forwarding my post and getting someone to buy my crashed car and collect it and so on and i dont have time to go to training so im going to try and find out if i can go another day as i want the experience so i can try and get a job at the hart which is this cool bar in chiswick which will be closer to where i live.  i think i can only hav an evening bar job if its close to home or ill never get any sleep.   one thing i know for sure is i belong in casual clothes and outdoors.  so i need to find a job that keeps me outdoors in the sunshine and wearing casual clothes.  i am such an informal person, i hate wearing 'office clothes' and being inside during the day.  but i hav to keep my goal in focus.  i am going to spend a year in australia and i hav to do whatever i can to get there in six months.  i just hope that my naturalisation application doesnt take too long.  i have to buy a plane ticket to oz as well as the oz visa and travel insurance on top of the £2000 i need.   i havent had any time to go looking at places to live yet.  there is one job that i want to apply for.  its a database executive for £11ph for a 5 month contract which is exactly what i want and its in holborn which is very easy to get to from chiswick.  i can do the job as orange wanted me to stay on permanently to do the exact same job but i left to go look after horses.  its basically facilitating the implimentation of a new database and training the people to use it.  god i hate big words, theyre so unecessary!  i have a trial day at pop in soho as a cocktail waitress on friday night.  from 10pm to 5am.  £5ph.  £25 for 5 hours plus tips but im not counting on that as this is england and english people dont know what a tip is.  still, its better than nothing and itll be a social environment, i just hope i can do it!  apparently celebrities who appear in heat magazine are regulars.  woo.  yay.  wen i go to oz, im going to learn to surf.  and then wen im finished there, i am going to go and surf around the world as a way of seeing the world.  i belong on the coast, ive always felt an affinity with the ocean and i think thats why i hav been so uncomfortable living in london, i am very far from where i should be and no matter how i have tried to get into a comfortable position it is becoming more and more apparent that i need to go back to the coast.  5 months.  its nothing.  i hope i can get all my visas and passports and savings and flights arranged in time.  please god, just do me this one favour.

      so threw a total tantrum wen i got home tonight at my moms. wearing office clothes again and marching around london going to agencies to tell them that i can indeed use a computer and type at a certain speed is really taking the fucking biscuit. the last thing on this planet that i want and im actually asking for it!!!!! then on my way home, hot and bothered and stuck on a bus which id waited 30 minutes for and was now in a traffic jam, i called moz to wish him a happy birthday only to learn that he is in ibiza and the sun had just gone down at mambo.  i wish someone would giv me a break. someone would come along and go lisa, this is where you should be and this is how to get there and youre ok, youre lovable and youll be ok and youll do something that you love and youll marry a wonderful man who will protect you and provide for you and love you implicitly and youll be a good mother and raise wonderful kids and everything will in fact be ok. that you will see the world and you will have something to say for yourself and you wont hav to worry about paying the bills and that your mother will be happy as she grows older. and you wont be stuck in england for the rest of your days.  i do know what i want from my life.   i want someone to love me and i want to love my life.     and i want a brown and white pony.

      im starting to feel new again.  like this great big heavy chain has been removed from me, like i have a future and i feel confident and positive enough to embrace it.  for so long ive been moping and depressed and so so lost, not knowing what to do with my life, and not enjoying living it.   ive been thinking back on my life in south africa, on how i spent everyday after school, on the weekend, during school holiday, on the beach with my friends.   the boat fishing beach, shelley beach; the popluar holiday beach, st michaels; the beach with the lagoon we'd jump into from the cliffs, uvongo; and margate beach where i did most of my growing up and groping ;)  my mom has a picture of her holiding me as a baby in the paddling pool, my last memory of that beach is the traditional new years eve party, i mustve been 15, very drunk and kissing anyone who would let me!   anyway, the point is, no matter where i was, or what i was doing, there was never this worry, this impending fear of what my future would hold, i dont think i even thought about it, i was having too much time enjoying my youth.  but yet even wen i was 20 and i knew i wanted to go to london and study dance and be in a janet jackson video, and i was ready and willing to end a relationship where we were in love, to pursue my dream, i never second guessed myself, i never worried that i wouldnt be able to do it.  yet wen i got here, i went to one dance class.  one dance class.  i have been here 5 years and been to one dance class.  i guess i had to deal with the culture shock and i came with £400 so i had to get working and i guess i was used to getting things so easily and so by the time i got over the culture shock, id already made clubbing friends and thrown myself into clubbing to try and ease myself into this new place.  three years later and i came up for air and realised i was 25 and didnt know what i was doing with my life or where i was going and felt like a big failure cos i hadnt done anything with the best part of my youth!  PANIC CITY!  so now each time i see a movie about dancing, or i watch the dancers in music videos or on top of the pops, i feel something, i understand the movements, the motivation, the feeling.  i know i am a born dancer, after all the years of doubting myself and second guessing myself, i know i am a born dancer.  living in london has showed me that i despise city life and the people who embrace it.  i despise working a 9-5 in an office.  because i was too scared to follow my dreams i tried to do a bit of it by becoming a stripper.  but it had nothing to do with the dancing, oh, it was a whole other ball game that i wasnt ready for.   so even though, sometimes, i feel like ive wasted these past few years, lost my way, gotten older, depleated my chances of a shining future, ive also learned what i already knew deep down inside.  the signs have all come together.  i like to be active, office life showed me that.  i like to be flexible with my time, office life showed me that.  i like to be my own boss, office life showed me that.  i like to be a show off, stripping showed me that.  i need to be free, my constant struggle against city life showed me that.  i need to study dance, no matter how old i am, i need to go and study it.  wether i start now before i go to oz, or after and go and study in america, i have to go do it.  i cannot fail myself at something i was born to do, and i know all too well the pain of failing one's self.  i want to go to oz, because i feel it will bring back some of my youth.  that fearlessness, that sense of freedom.  i think wen you live in a country with vast space and sky and light you cannot help but feel free.  wen you look over the ocean most of your time, you cannot escape that feeling of freedom.  and i think that is why i hav felt so confined and jailed in the UK.  in south africa, i dont ever remember worrying if id get a job, i dont ever remember worrying about anything on the scale i worry here in the UK.  life was always just so free and easy, you needed a job, youd go and get it.  always smiling, everyone, always smiling.  thats how i remember it anyway.  i dont ever remember having the kind of worry, panic, anxiety and depression that i have experienced in this country, not even during the things i had to go through sometimes.  i guess south africa is just permeated with this sense of hope.  we have been through so much and we know the rest of the world is years ahead of us, but we are healing ourselves and healing our country, how could you not want to, it is so worth the effort.  my only hope is that south africa never ever becomes like england.  never ever becomes so incredibly saturated with the unecessary.  never ever focuses its attention on things that are unimportant to the life of human beings.  never ever forgets what makes life worth living.  people in the UK focus on the negative as tho they wouldnt exist if they didnt know the impending and current danger.  as though they wouldnt feel alive if all was not wrong all around them.  its as though they thrive on it and because the balance is not right, they immerse themselves in people who appear successful, so they feel that its not all bad.  i guess you cant blame a nation that lives on a cold, wet, grey island.  i mean south africa has major problems, HUGE problems, but the people still smile and still dance in the street, they still have incredible hope for their futures, and they dont care if you are on telly, youre just one of everyone.  it must be down to the weather.  and i think thats why i know i have to get out of the united kingdom.  i need to go back to a place where people are full of hope and happiness, not doom and gloom.  i guess i feel it more because i have experienced both and i know that wen you are in it, you dont know that its so bad until you go somewhere different.  today i am moving back to london to find a place to live and a job.  i am nervous, but i am also steeled by an incredible determination to get out of here.  for the first time in a long long time, i can see a light at the end of the tunnel and i will get to that light.  i will no longer hold myself back.

      you know how wen you meet someone you really like, you cant stop thinking about them?  well im like that with oz.  all i can think about is being there and experiencing it and the things im gonna do and how im gonna feel out there and how its all gonna be a whole new experience.  i cant frikkin wait!!!  part of me thinks i should be focusing all this energy on finding a job. hav decided to move all my stuff to my mom's and hav slinky there too cos her window is always open now so he can get in and out, just so i can stay in london and find a place to live and a job without worrying about slinky being fed while im away.   i will have to come and fetch my pc and it's desk once ive found a place to rent.  i hope i dont have to look too long, but the gumtree.com is proving invaluable.  i hope i can get a bar job without any references too...
