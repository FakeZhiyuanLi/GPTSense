      There are two kinds of people in the world... Actually, there are undoubtedly more than two kinds of people in the world, but for the sake of conveniently discussing dichotomies, the dual nature of man and most pitched arguments, just about everything seems to be divided into two sides and if you aren’t blindly entrenched in one of those two sides spewing the dogma and party line, then both sides view you as trying to placate both sides. So as I was saying, there are two kinds of people in the world, the kind of people who see things in linear terms and the kind of people who possess three dimensional thought. I, of course, am a three-dimensional, non-linear thinker, but then nobody describes themselves as a two-dimensional, linear thinker because those are often just a polite way of calling someone stupid. Since, clearly, there is no one here who is either “stupid,” “linear” or two-dimensional, we can feel free to discuss. Linear thinkers tend to use more flattering terms to describe themselves such as “straight thinker,” “straight talker,” “straight shooter “straight forward” or “endowed with tremendous common sense.” To them, the world is not often a confusing place unless they meet someone who takes more than a split-second to make up their mind, encounter someone who changes their mind when new facts become available, talks to someone capable of considering more than two variables at any moment or watches the news. And even that confusion can be easily dismissed as someone trying to fool them by using some sort of double talk or witchcraft.  I imagine the way a linear thinker feels is much the same way Neanderthals felt when they came toe to toe with homo sapiens for the first time. Suddenly, thousands of years at the top of the evolutionary ladder came crashing down around them as these other men showed up and beat them to the prize. As modern homo sapiens, we tend to take the name “Neanderthal” in vain. A couple of theories exist about what happened to Neanderthals. One suggests they died out because we took all their land and food when we outbred them. That sounds like us; we do like nookie and stealing. Another theory suggests they didn’t disappear so much as were consumed by us as we combined two species into one. Like horses and donkeys having mules. Some mules are a little more horse, some more donkey.  I like that theory because it explains so much about the human race and why there seem to be two basic kinds of people.  Each one of us is part modern man and part old-fashioned cavedwelling trog. One side of the family favors abstract thought, the other likes flinging poo at people we don’t like. One side likes designing advanced weapons to ensure the survival of the race, the other side just likes to kill anything that moves for fun. One side like painting their adventures on cave walls, the other side likes sitting around the fire telling stories. And just like anybody drawing from two very different families, these traits get comingled and mixed up and used in different proportions. And so it goes with the whole race of man. Some of us are clearly not capable of non-linear thought, but rather than accept that that is a limitation, we try to play it off as a positive. The best way to do that is never admit you might not be the sharpest tool in the shed. Never admit you are or were wrong. Fail to understand the complexities of any situation but see that as the other guy’s failure to render the situation in “clear terms” and accuse him of fence-straddling or sbfuscation. Talk about law and order, right and wrong, good and evil, black and white, this and that, good guys vs. bad guys, us and them. And never, under any circumstances see the millions of shades of gray that make up the world. And since no one ever things of themselves as “a bad guy,” you must always think of yourself and anyone on your team as “a good guy” even if all of the evidence points in the opposite direction. The world is a complicated place, but don’t let that goad you into complex thought or worse, complex explanations. Stick to the idea that if the world is indeed complicated, all it takes to uncomplicate it is some straight forward action – usually violence. Because when thinking fails, bombs work. At least bombs blow up and that is a kind of “working” even if it doesn’t put food in anyone’s mouth or forgiveness in anyone’s heart. Of course, as straightforward as I might try to be, someone will probably see all of this as an exercise is convolution or crazy talk if they haven’t already been distracted by a shiny object or a reality show. So I will sum up with these words by British pop star Seal who said it best when he sang: How are we ever gonna survive unless we get a little crazy?

      Quentin Tarantino spiel from the film "Sleep With Me" by Roger Avary  What's a film about, what's it really about? What genre does it take?   [Duane: What, like the spine? Like one sentence?]   No, I don't, fucking boy meets girl, I don't give a shit about that. Fuck boy meets girl, fuck motorcycle movie. No, what is really being said? What's really being said, that's what you're talking about. 'Cause the whole idea, man, is subversion. You want subversion on a massive level. You know what one of the greatest fucking scripts ever written in the history of Hollywood is? Top Gun.   [Duane: Oh, come on.]   Top Gun is fucking great. What is Top Gun? You think it's a story about a bunch of fighter pilots.   [Duane: It's about a bunch of guys waving their dicks around.]   It is a story about a man's struggle with his own homosexuality. It is! That is what Top Gun is about, man. You've got Maverick, all right? He's on the edge, man. He's right on the fucking line, all right? And you've got Iceman, and all his crew. They're gay, they represent the gay man, all right? And they're saying, go, go the gay way, go the gay way. He could go both ways.  [Duane: What about Kelly McGillis?]   Kelly McGillis, she's heterosexuality. She's saying: no, no, no, no, no, no, go the normal way, play by the rules, go the normal way. They're saying no, go the gay way, be the gay way, go for the gay way, all right? That is what's going on throughout that whole movie...  He goes to her house, all right? It looks like they're going to have sex, you know, they're just kind of sitting back, he's takin' a shower and everything. They don't have sex. He gets on the motorcycle, drives away. She's like, "What the fuck, what the fuck is going on here?" Next scene, next scene you see her, she's in the elevator, she is dressed like a guy. She's got the cap on, she's got the aviator glasses, she's wearing the same jacket that the Iceman wears. She is, okay, this is how I gotta get this guy, this guy's going towards the gay way, I gotta bring him back, I gotta bring him back from the gay way, so I'm do that through subterfuge, I'm gonna dress like a man. All right? That is how she approaches it.  Okay, now let me just ask you -- I'm gonna digress for two seconds here. I met this girl Amy here, she's like floating around here and everything. Now, she just got divorced, right?...  All right, but the REAL ending of the movie is when they fight the MIGs at the end, all right? Because he has passed over into the gay way. They are this gay fighting fucking force, all right? And they're beating the Russians, the gays are beating the Russians. And it's over, and they fucking land, and Iceman's been trying to get Maverick the entire time, and finally, he's got him, all right? And what is the last fucking line that they have together? They're all hugging and kissing and happy with each other, and Ice comes up to Maverick, and he says, "Man, you can ride my tail, anytime!" And what does Maverick say? "You can ride mine!" Swordfight! Swordfight! Fuckin' A, man! -- According to a June 1995 Details profile on Val Kilmer:  "He got all buffed out for the role of Iceman, Tom Cruise's adversary, and while he didn't like the script ("I turned it down at first, but Paramount had an option they exercised, so I had to do it"), Top Gun remains a key film of the '80s--the most representative of not only what was wrong with movies but what was wrong with this country's values. It's also the most unintentionally gay movie ever made by a big studio, so homoerotic it's like some kind of camp joke. It's impossible to watch it without thinking of Quentin Tarantino's hilarious monologue about the movie's gay subtext in the we're-hip-screenwriters-in-Hollywood flick "Sleep With Me," which Kilmer hasn't seen. All he'll say about the above, while smiling, is "Oh yeah?" "

      Richard Biggs, 44, who played Dr. Stephen Franklin on the 1994-98 sydicated science fiction series "Babylon 5" died Saturday at his California home of either a stroke or an aneursim, according to his Web site.  "Babylon 5" series creator J. Michael Straczynski said that whatever happened, it happened quickly. "What seems to have happened, happened quickly," Straczynski wrote. "He woke up, got up out of bed and went down."

      This is an old column from my college days if you are interested in seeing the evolution of an author. I think it was around the time of Matthew Shepard's murder.   Greg Jerrett (Daily Columnist) October 16, 1998  Well, it has been one HELL of a week. And what have we learned? Not much. People keep on killing each other, and crackers keep on making jokes about it.  I can't even tell you how many of these "gems" came to my attention by way of the Quick Es.   Here's a little something for all you gay-bashing shit-stompers out there in "we hate fags, too, Reverend Phelps" land.  While watching a recent episode of "Loveline," Dr. Drew (who is a real practicing doctor and not just some quack, you know) had cause to call attention to a recent study about male sexual behavior.   Two groups of straight men were gathered. Half of the group claimed to have little to no problem with homosexuality, while the second half of the sample were self-proclaimed bigots.  Both groups were hooked up to sophisticated, electronic, medical, monitoring devices or "cockrings" which would record any activity in the nether regions.   Before you start sending in your letters and Quick Es about how wrong it is to hate the Dutch, I am talking about their penises.  Both groups were then given a saucy selection of salacious homoerotica to watch, like "Hard into Gary" or "Donnie Does Dennis" or "COPS" -- you know the kind of stuff I'm on about.   Wouldn't you know that the group that squawked the loudest about how much they hated homosexuals had the highest rate of responses.   The ones who hated gays the most got the most excited about seeing two men go at it fast and furious.  You always knew it was true though, didn't you?   I mean, all those years I was growing up listening to the macho wankers make fun of the wussy boys by calling them "homos," "queers" and "fags," I just knew that their real motivation was sexual frustration!   Guys don't really make fun of gays because they hate them so much as they hate the fact that they are secretly excited by them.  Here is how it goes. Young Slab "Not at all Gay" Hardnoggin sees a slightly-built lad with a nice ass and, before he has a chance to repress his feelings, they get the best of him.   He has to act out before he has the chance to feel ashamed.   He gets some of his cavebuddies to kick the crud out of the boy so he can get rid of that loving feeling and replace it with some good, old-fashioned hate.  A kid I knew in high school used to get boners in the shower all the time -- let's call him Rod.   I don't know why Rod was often stimulated, and I don't really care. I didn't make a big deal out of it. I was sprouting wood on the bus with breathtaking regularity, so what did that make me? Wood has a life of its own; who was I to judge?   It was kind of funny, but I wasn't sent into some kind of homicidal rage over it like a couple of the super-dominant, thick-browridge types who had to make a big show of how pissed they were that this little "fairy" was naked in the same room with us.  Well, they cornered young Rod, beat the hell out of him and then stood around high-fiving each other like a bunch of troglodytes, joyful in the knowledge that they had managed to repress their natural instincts for one more day.  What a joke. One of these guys -- let's call him Jeff (because that was his real name and I don't care who knows it) -- used to love to rack anybody he could get his sweaty little hands on.   Walking through those halls could be a nightmare of testicular agony for those of us who were comfortable enough with our masculinity to not try and touch the nads of the other boys.   This is classic projection, really. Confused by his desires to mount the other boys, in spite of what he was sure of as his "diehard heterosexuality," Jeff entered a deep state of denial and projected his self-loathing onto others by beating them senseless while his slope-headed friends were amazed at his show of masculine prowess.  Have you ever noticed that it is always the fiercest homophobes who do the really killer imitations of gays?   They love to prance it up and do the whole limp-wristed tinkerbell thing while they mince around the room getting to act out in a fashion which would never be acceptable to them if it weren't drenched in hatred.  So for those of you who intend to spend the next week or so reacting to the death of Matthew Shepard by passing along shit-stupid jokes you got off of the Internet and making up crass comments of your own about gays, just remember that the straight guys who have no problems with homosexuals are the ones who really have nothing to worry about.   So now that you've had a chance to think about it, heard any good jokes lately?

      Not to pressure you, but I'd really like to see some stories come out of you folks. If you could possible spare the time to sit down or as they say where I come from "set down" and write, why that would be great.

      Here's a story from my college years.   The summer after Kirk left, Pete and I knew we needed to find either a place to ourselves or roommates.  Pete worked with a guy named Joe Burroughs at Hy-Vee in Council Bluffs whose brother Tom went to ISU and was looking for a couple of people to move in with him and his buddy Pete Schnoebelen.  This was a year full of mystery and suspense. Pot and pussy. TV and temper tantrums. Love, hate, laughter and bitter recriminations.  First off, I was finally 21 and ready to do some damage.  Secondly, Tom was a fucking slob from hell. He was 6'4", 400 pounds of worthless fucking, do nothing lazy-assed CB-style grease stain who, after acing every year of high school getting 4.0ed and honor rolled, suddenly lost all initiative to do anything but watch TV and sleep because his mommy and daddy weren't there to kick his ass out of bed every morning. We didn't even have cable, so what he watched until 2 a.m. is a mystery to me.   He was a no class goin' vet-med wannabe, stripper lovin',"Quincy" watching, 12 hours on his ass, sleep til three, fartin' in his sleep, guinea pig killin', teflon pan burning, wart soakin', no dish washing, purple lounge chair destroyin' so and so! Oh and his nickname was Bobo.

      I can't wait for Charleton Heston to die. I think it's just time. He's like an incontinent old sheepdog whose lost his chew toy. He keeps wandering around the living room piddling on all the furniture. It's time he be put out of his misery.  The world has just gotten too weird for him. His values, far from defending American liberty and values, have become the very things that twist and pervert this nation into a wicked caricature of its former self.   I respect what he was. In many ways he made me the man I am today. "Soylent Green," "The Planet of the Apes" and  "Omega Man" were all great influences on me in the early 70s. Ironic that such a right-wing whackjob could make anyone lean left.

      World War II was the perfect war for the United States. We didn't start it. We didn't join it for the wrong reasons. We were on the right side. We were attacked. We defened ourselves. We fought hard enough to be sure that we were tested to the fullest of our abilities, as were our enemies, and we prevailed.   We prevailed not only because we were stronger, smarter and damn lucky, but because our way of life was superior. The American fighting man of World War II wasn't the most disciplined soldier on the battlefield nor did he have the most training or experience with war. He knew he was right. He knew what was at stake.  We won because our mettle was tested and found not wanting of anything plus our men had lived through the deprivations of the Great Depression. We were the good guys. Our victory was clean and pure, hard-earned and mostly guilt free.  If there was ever a war like World War II in all of history, I haven't heard about it and if another opportunity like it comes along, I hope the cockroaches enjoy it as much as we did.

      Love is a drug like heroin. The first time you try it, it feels so good you can't believe everyone isn't doing it. It rages through your system so hard that you're never the same again. If you try to quit, you just lie in bed feeling like hell and  s h i t  yourself until its out of your system. Then the next chance you get, you so it all over again.  greg

      I am finding it hard to give a shit about Ronald Reagan being dead. That man may be the conservative God of presidents but to me he will was just another whackjob conservative who sent this country down the toilet and everyone running around singing his praises acts like he did the exact opposite. He shit on the working man in this country, had NOTHING to do with the fall of the USSR going down except engaging them in a huge game of economic chicken. My childhood was spent in paranoia waiting for him to push the effen button and if one more person suggests that he recieves one more god damn unreasonable honor like renaming another airport or some shit after that dead fuck, I'm gonna lose it.   Fuck you Ronnie, you will get yours in hell!

      I have been re-reading 1984. It's my third time through this book as well as Brave New World. While 1984 is supposed to be a critical fictional discourse on why communism sucks, I've always thought it had plenty to say about the ills of government in general as well.   Consider how everyone likes to talk about privacy issues in terms of Big Brother even in the USA, but when it comes to doublespeak, newspeak and accusations of thoughtcrime, which I find plentiful, no one seems to leap on those. Orwell actually produced a book that was broader in scope, I think, than even he intended. We refer to the machinations of government quite often as Orwellian. Not communist, Orwellian.   The world he created is extremely fascistic. Whether a government/economic system is communist or capitalist, it can still oppress its people. What is wagging the dog, the cold war, the war on terrorism if not a modern replica of the three-way system of continuous warfare seen in 1984?  For my money, there is every bit as much warning in those pages against the military industrial complex as there is against commies.

      I was recently insulted by one of my "veteran friends" for a column I wrote called "Searching for WWII." In it, I basically said that ever since the end of WWII, we have been trying to relive the experience not unlike a junkie looking for that one pure high he got the first time he scored. I rather liked it, as did The Old Town Review and WWII vet friend of mine.   What this other guy seemed to be so pissed about was that according to his perspective, I basically took a huge shit on the 140,000 men who died in Korea by not making it sound as good and pure as WWII. What a bunch of bullshit.   That was kind of the whole point, wasn't it? I mean, we won WWII. I've seen MASH, we basically called Korea a tie after MacArthur fucked it up and got the Chinese involved. If we hadn't gone ramming up to China, ALL OF KOREA would be free today and not just the south.  This note I got, basically helped me to prove my original point, which was that everything we do has to be compared to WWII.   Now Bush Jr. is trying to compare the war on terror with WWII not a full week after that last column.

      My entire life seems to have been dedicated to the kind of primitive ancestor worship once decried as savage by civilized man, but perpetuated today by him when it is called Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, 4th of July and now even Flag Day.   I'm tired holding my manhood and American citizenship cheap in comparison to the hordes of aging veterans in this country who keep reminding us every god damn time we turn around that we owe everything to them because they fought in WWII, Korea, Nam, Iraq or Grenada for God's sake.   GIVE IT A REST would you? I'm sorry I didn't fight in Nam, but I was three, OK? And while I didn't fight in Korea, it sure feels like it since I've experienced the monotony and pain of that conflict by watching ever episode of M*A*S*H about 20 times. Grenada was a joke and Iraq is ... hell, I don't even know what to make of that one yet, except I think global terrorism has been used an excuse to fleece us and them in order to fill the pockets of Halliburton and its stockholders with no remorse for the dean and dying on all sides.  I guess I could have gone to Iraq the first time, but guess what? I disagreed with that little conflict. Personally, I thought if Kuwaiti boys wanted to be free, they should fight for it their damn selves. Call me crazy, but I still do.   I remember when war memorials used to be tasteful. Now it seems they don't exist unless they are huge interactive stone displays that block the view of the reflecting pool from the Washington Monument. Excuse me, but I thought the whole purpose of the reflecting pool was to reflect the Washington Monument as you looked at it from the Lincoln Memorial?  And of course, failing to show the "proper" respect makes you guilty of thoughtcrime.  i've written dozens of stories about veterans and every single one was just the proper god damn story because I know these guys had it hard and I respect that fact more than anyone knows. But it is only when I express my dissent over the current war tht I get accused of not respecting veterans, which pisses me off. Just once I'd love to tell one of these guys, hey, you didn't fight for my right to say whatever the fuck I want to say just so I couldn't say it and I respect your sacrifice too much to not disagree with you SO FUCK OFF!

      I got this e-mail from a teacher about my Saturday column entitled, "Shaker joints not so bad." Following is my response to her.  ---------------- Perhaps because at 34 I'm an "old fogey"... or   perhaps before reading your article on Saturday I spent part of the morning explaining to my seven year old daughter why some wacko would leave a "nasty picture" on the slide at the park on 8th street... or   perhaps it's because my 12 year old son happily delivers the NonPareil each day and then comes home to digest the great knowledge he has disseminated across the neighborhood...0r   perhaps it's because I haven't lived here all that long and so was mistaken about the generally accepted community standards of the people of Council Bluffs...or   perhaps it's just because I still believe in "all the news that's fit to print"...   Whatever the reason - I think you crossed the line with Saturday's column on, of all things, the proper etiquette for strip club visits.  I have chosen to believe that you must have simply had writer's block and so dug into an old file labeled "Column ideas to bring repulsive pictures to the minds of my readers".  Whatever could have possessed you to think that the subscribers of the Council Bluffs paper wanted to learn how many places across this great land that you have visited "jiggle joints"?  The article might have been great advice for a fraternity newsletter or even as a side-bar in Playboy but not in our community newspaper.   Last week I received an advertisement from the Omaha World Herald encouraging me to use their Newspapers in Education program.  I had thought about seeing if Council Bluffs had a similar program for my high school classroom, but if your column is what is getting by the NonPareil editors, I think I'll stick with Omaha.     Greg, I believe that you can do better!  Please do!   Ruthie Oberg Council Bluffs, IA   -----------------------------   you're right. you probably haven't been living here long enough.    Forcing my opinions on other people is my job. That's what I get paid for. That is not, however, what a teacher gets paid for. I find it offensive that you would suggest "sticking" with the Omaha paper which is widely known to never cover ANYTHING in this community unless it's murder, severe animal neglect, pedophilia, bizarre hickishness or strip club related. They also have some of the worst, most boring and NonPoignant columnists I've ever read. And all because you disagree with me. I am the only Council Bluffs born and raised columnist that any of these Council Bluffs kids has ever seen. I am routinely discussed in classrooms and have even been read from the pulpit and invited to speak at churches.   I can assure you that this community finds my subject matter plenty acceptible and if you'd like to see some comments from other teachers, school board members and students FROM council bluffs that i count as friends and fans, I'd be happy to pass them along.   You did give me a good column idea though.   thanks for reading, greg jerrett

      The passing of an American president is an historical event well-worth much of the coverage we have seen this last week. President Ronald Reagan meant a great deal to all Americans whether they accept that inevitable reality of history or not. Besides, how often do we get the chance to see a state funeral plastered all over the networks, cable news outlets and C-SPAN ... 24 hours a day no less?  I would say the passing of our nation’s 40th president certainly rates at least 85 percent of the attention it is getting. Although I would like to have been able to pick up my mail from the retail counter of the Post Office on Friday before it is “returned to sender.” Hold it for me would you fellas? I am easily distracted by life’s minutiae and even though it is mostly bills, junk mail, creditor threats and a few back issues of the German “art” magazine Großformatig Vierzigerinnen, I should still rummage through it. Back on track, now.  This is not the time for partisanship or so I’ve heard from people who were clearly big, big fans of R-squared before he passed on. But I agree with them. The time for disrespectful displays toward a great man by politicians who simply cannot stand the fact that a national treasure has passed into the hereafter is not now. That time will come when President Clinton dies, I’m sure. It is also not the time for tasteless jokes like this one left on the newsroom voicemail system: Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan are on a lifeboat full of people when it starts to sink. President Carter stands up and says, “Save the women and children! Save the women and children!” President Nixon says, “Screw the women and children!” Then President Reagan stands up and says, “Well, that won’t be necessary Richard, Congress and I pretty much took care of that already.” Now, what kind of message does this send to the world? If this column didn’t run today, Saturday, the day after the officially-sanctioned day of mourning for the second or third greatest American president of the 20th century – maybe fourth – then I wouldn’t have even dared think that joke let alone repeat it in print. But we are grown-ups and in order to vilify, we must sometimes testify, mustn’t we? Let me tell you a little something I know I’m pretty sure I believe about Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan never intentionally screwed over women, children or anybody while in office. I believe with all of my canned ham-sized heart that if Ronald Reagan screwed over anybody, it was largely unintentional and can probably be blamed on his early foray into Democratness. I know I believe that Ronald Reagan was a kind man, a good man who believed in the greatness of America with the kind of single-minded fervor usually held by people who were too young to serve in World War I and too old to serve in World War II in a combat capacity.  And just as the purveyor of that joke should be largely if not wholly ashamed of himself, so too should the people who remind us that by the end of Reagan’s two terms, 138 administration officials from the EPA, HUD, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon had been convicted, indicted or been made the subject of official investigations for official misconduct and/or other official criminal violations, according to journalist Haynes Johnson in his 1991 book “Sleepwalking Through History.” And shame on Joe Conason of Salon.com for reminding us at this mournful time of otherwise low synaptic activity “that HUD Secretary Sam Pierce took the Fifth Amendment when called to testify about the looting of his agency – the first cabinet official to seek that constitutional protection since the Teapot Dome scandal.” And why bring up that Attorney General Edwin Meese was burned in the Wedtech contracting scandal or that Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger bit it in Iran-contra (Conason). A pox on he who reminds us about the time back in 1981 when Reagan fired 11,359 striking air traffic controllers, members of the same union, PATCO, that had supported Reagan for president over Jimmy Carter only nine months prior. He then banned them for life from being rehired by the FAA ... FOR LIFE! This action did one thing described two different ways: If you work, it undermined the rights of working men and women and if your business is business, it restored flexibility to hiring practices (Time, Newsweek).  Tasteless also at this time would be to remind anyone that the covert backing and CIA training of radical Islamist mujahideen guerrillas (including Osama bin Laden) against the Soviets in 1979 (a good thing on the face of it) led to the rise of the Taliban and Al Qaeda after Afghanistan was abandoned wholesale by a short-sighted United States as soon as the Soviets left. When you paint with such big strokes, you’re bound to sell arms to Iran and give the money to the Contra in ... anybody? anybody? ... Nicaragua in direct opposition to Congress or as most Americans call it, breaking the law. BIG PICTURE, people. Big picture. But just as ashamed should be the people who mythologize Ronald Reagan by insisting that his face be placed on half the dimes and the $10 bill replacing Founding Father, first Secretary of the Treasury, creator of the American economic system and second place duelist Alexander Hamilton. C’mon, man, the man who single-handedly destroyed the Soviet Union, which was nowhere near crumbling before 1980 doesn’t need anything so paltry as his face on currency. At least he doesn’t when ... There has been serious talk from fanciful folk with imaginations like children that Ronald Reagan’s head should be squeezed on to Mount Rushmore, a feat that is not only physically and geologically impossible, but artistic vandalism.  No, now is not the time to bring reality into sharp focus. Leave that until Monday. n Next Storytellers at Barley’s will be June 23. Poets and tellers of stories welcome for what I can guarantee is the most interesting night of the week in Council Bluffs. Free admission, reasonably-priced nachos, A/C and love!

      I don't think i can do "love." Much in the same way that a microwave can't really do a Thanksgiving Day turkey.  I am just not wired to accept such input.   I was raised out in the sticks where my best prospect for love was livestock. Not that I've ever done it with livestock, but I kinda sorta understand where that pressure comes from. Thank god for p0rn0graphy or I'd have really been in trouble. That's no way for a child to learn about love and sex and all that stuff?   I asked my mom, what's mastrubation? she told me to look it up in the dictionary! I looked up mastication by mistake, now every time I chew gum, I get an erection.   I tell you it was tough.

      My job is writing and sometimes with the e-mails and comment boards, I just get bogged down, or should I say, BLOGGED DOWN? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA!  Seriously though. I can't catch a break. I feel like I live in the busiest, loudiest vacuum ever created. Is that wrong? I'm lonely, yet I hate crowds. I think I need to find a good ho-house or maybe a really adventurous 18-year old who is blind.   Maybe I just need to get some plants around my place. That might do the trick.  I just got a new cell phone last weekend. The cord on the one I had for three years went bad. Not the phone itself you understand, just the cord. The cord would have cost $32 to fix, but a new phone was free. I was torn. Then the dude told me I could play Asteroids all I wanted on the new phone for $4. I was pumped.   My fingers are numb. It's hard to jerk it when youy fingers are numb because masturbation is about giving as well as receiving pleasure. Life sucks and is frustrating.   I have a full-time grown-up career type job as a reporter and I can barely afford my medication. I'm thinking about pan-handling. Maybe I should have become a cocaine mule when I had the chance.  My bang buddy recently wigged on me. Which is really too bad since we hadn't gotten around to having sex yet. Does that count? I don't know why peole make promises they can't keep.   The other day I ate four Whoppers ... with cheese. Not all at once, I mean, I'm not a pig. I had two for lunch and then two more for dinner. I ate enough calories to sustain a family of five in India for a month. And the really scary thing is ... I liked it.   I almost beat the shit out of this guy the other day for cutting in line at the grocery store. He knew I was there. I could tell because he did that kind of stupid "I can't see you but I'm looking at everything else but you" look. I've seen that look. I've done that look. I didn't "get up in his grill" about it, but i did say to my nephew, "hey, this guy thinks he's in front of us." Which he heard of course, because in addition to "not looking" at us, he was also "not listening" to us just to see if we noticed. He got snotty with me, "Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there." I weigh in at 400 pounds. The  chance of anyone not seeing me is pretty slim. I said, "Well now you do." One thing led to another and I called him a stupid white piece of shit. Not because I hate whitey or anything, I just wanted to say something to him that would really, REALLY piss him off. I've said worse, believe me.   This woman once told me to watch my mouth in front of her kid. I said, "Lady, fuck you and your kid." Which in retrospect is a little over the top, but what can I say, not everything out my mouth is fucking poetry and roses. You gotta problem with that?  I used to work at a Taco John's. It was one of the best jobs I ever had in my life. I never went to the grocery store. I lived off burritos and potato ole's. If I had paid full price for everything I ate, I would have spent nearly $50 a day. And those were 1988 dollars mind you. My supervisor was a college girl – I was a college boy – so that was cool. One day she came over to my houe to get a massage. Apparently I let slip that I had good massage hands. There we were in my apartment all alone, me giving this good-looking blond dutch chick a massage. I had NO GAME whatsoever in those days. Hell, I still don't. Any real man would have gotten laid because what college girl would go over to a guy's house for a massage, a couple beers and Prince and not be at least vaguely interested. I didn't even approach the subject like "gosh, you know this would be much easier if you just took your bra off." You know, see if that works then ride her like a circus pony.  You know what they say, if you can't get laid in college, things aint gonna get any better.   I don't know, but I've been told a lot of things.  Later on at Taco John's this same supervisor sabotaged my promotion chances. It was sexual discrimination if I ever saw it, which is kind of cool for me when you think about it. That's the closest I've come to a loving caring relationship.

      The Chamber of Commerce for the state of North Dakota, a.k.a. the Greater North Dakota Association, is once again proposing to change the name of their state — North Dakota — to simply “Dakota.” They feel  the “North” in “North Dakota” is giving people the idea that North Dakota is a frigid, treeless dessert in spite of the fact that it sometimes gets quite warm. Former governor of North Dakota, Ed Schafer said, “People have such an instant thing about how North Dakota is cold and snowy and flat. We’re not going to change that overnight. But [a name change] would get a lot of attention. Personally, I think it would be fun.” Fun, Ed? Like grandma’s birthday party fun or like waiting at the dentist on new magazine day fun? This may be the most brilliant marketing scheme since Benjamin Franklin told Thomas Jefferson, “Maybe instead of ‘Up yours, England!’ we should call it ‘The Declaration of Independence’ ... class it up, you know?” In an Associated Press story, some state officials worry the plan might subject North Dakota to national ridicule and abuse on a par with dirty swirlies and atomic wedgies. Gee, d’ya think? Dakota IS a great name, that’s why there is not a strip club in the United States that doesn’t have at least two, one for the day shift and a good-looking one at night. Dakota sounds like that kid in “The Outsiders” who gets beat up by the Socs and makes the Greasers itch for a rumble.  “You saved those kids from burning in that church, Dakota, you’re a hero.”  “Stay gold, Ponyboy.”  “I’d like to, Dakota, but I already promised Dallas, Sodapop, Beelzebubba, Junebug and Raspberryripple I’d get me a job sackin’ at the Piggly Wiggly.” Current governor of North Dakota, John Hoeven said he is willing to listen to arguments for the idea, but said he likes “North Dakota.” “I’m more focused in getting out there and talking about all the wonderful things we have here, whether it’s quality of work force, quality environment, great tourism, great education,” he said. He failed to mention the fact that there hasn’t been one reported case of settlers being overrun by Indians in North Dakota for nearly 17 years. That’s got to count for something. This would mark the first time a state has changed its name since Mosquito Infested Hellhole changed its name to Lousiana.  Research on this marketing scheme could open the door for other less-than-funky or dork states to do likewise. It also raises a number of issues. First off, it IS cold in North Dakota, who are they kidding? They should change the name to Cold Dakota. When I hear “North Carolina” I don’t think cold. The “North” isn’t the issue, reality is. South Dakota is no doubt unhappy about the proposal because they are going to look like the lesser Dakota and that’s just not true. All Dakotas are equal. They will have to change their name to something like “Orignal Dakota” or “Dakota Lite” to keep up.  Then Nebraska is going to realize that when people think “Nebraska,” they think of corn and truck driving schools so they will have to change their name to “Tranquilvania” or maybe “France” to beef up there image. What about Kansas and Arkansas? Basically they have the same name but one has an “Ar” in front of it. Don’t Europeans get confused when making  vacation plans in these states?  And let’s not even get started on the whole Iowa-Idaho-Ohio conundrum that has confused scholars and “Tonight Show” guests alike for decades. No one can ever remember which state grows what. Should we help them out with additional info in the title like CornIowa, SpudIdaho or The-One-With-Cleveland-In-It-Ohio? Maybe Iowa just needs a good tagline. We might then write our address as Council Bluffs, Iowa, You Make Me Smile Like That Keven Costner Movie 50011. Or maybe changing a state’s name for giggles is just a heinously bad idea cooked up by the kind of money-grubbing and thoughtless kind of people who invented New Coke.  Unless you are going from “Indian Territory” to “Oklahoma” or you want to split off from Virginia and remain part of the Union, you should not be changing the name of your state just to manipulate the impression people have of you.  If the impression people have of your state is accurate, but you would like to modify it, try a more traditional and less Orwellian  add campaign like “North Dakota: It’s Hot As Hell Up Here” or “North Dakota: It’s 20-1 Gals to Guys, You Do The Math!”

      I got a massage last week. First one ever. I was afraid that I would get a boner but that didn't happen. Then I was kind of disappointed. The days of the magic wand are long gone. Good bye surprisingly exciting school bus rides and trips down high school halls with a gym bag in front of it.  The massage itself rocked. I like being rubbed down good, but I can see this escalating because I already wish I could have gotten it a bit harder on my feet and calves which are kind of dead and lumpy feeling. They need to be deep tissue rubbed in order for me to get the benefit.  When I stood up, it felt like I was drunk. It was awesome and I was mellow for hours afterwards.    I never realized how hard it is to actually relax. Just let go. But it is.   I think I'll ask for whale song or Tom Waits next time.

      I've had a request or two for the old columns from the past years, besides, I thought it would be good to have a place to archive them online anyway. So here it is. Turns out you can only see about 10 at a time. I've put up over 30, it's a pretty quick process. Until I fix that little problem, you will only be able to see them in the archive when that section of the archive becomes active. I will fix the number of posts listed to unlimited ASAP!

      Since Council Bluffs was just ranked no. 5 on St. Martin's Press's Most Polite Cities List, I would like to take this opportunity, if you please, to talk about politeness, good manners and the tyranny of nice people.  I am not a nice man. I have never claimed to be nice nor have I aspired to "niceness" at any time in my life. I come from a long line of frontiersmen and not nice outdoor types and should I ever get the chance to breed, I am sure my offspring will not be nice either. I do not lament this fact. I see "niceness" as a plastic veneer of false pleasantry that can just as easily be covering something truly dark or truly vacant.  Some of the most horrible people I have ever met in my life were quite nice. "Nothing personal," they would say and "have a nice day" as you gasped for your last breath. You never saw it coming due to all that niceness.  Nice people can screw you over just as fast as anyone and being nice is just evolutionary camoflage they use to fool you long enough to get in under your radar and sink a knife between your ribs.  I worked with one of the nicest racists I have ever met in my life while at college. She was so sweet you just wanted to dip her in your coffee like a candy cane. She sang in her church choir and didn't engage in naughty banter. She had a smile for everyone and truly believe in niceness as a way of life. She could laugh right when she was expected to whether she got a joke or not.  She was terribly nice one day when I was ordering Chinese for the office and asked her if she might like some crab rangoon or anything.  No thanks, I don't eat Chinese, she said.  Why, I queried, too sweet? No, I just think those people are dirty, she countered sweetly like Donna Reed goosestepping in jackboots. They don't have the same standards of cleanliness as us. Wow, I thought quietly to myself, this chick is seriously messed up as I backed away slowly smiling nicely so as not to draw attention from the demon that was obviously living inside of her. Not one of the greatest people I have ever known personally or admired from far off were nice. Mark Twain, in spite of the Disneyfied version most Americans get of him and his work, was not a nice man. He smoked and drank and made frightfully witty putdowns of people he felt were worthy of ridicule. He was fond of making off color jokes and remarks in polite society just for fun, but he wrote against slavery and hated true evil. He just knew the difference between what is truly wicked and what is just a wicked good time. My grandmother is not a nice person, but she could kill chickens all day long and give half of them away. With a bloody knife in her right hand and a bloody Camel in her mouth - kill, kill, kill, give, give give. And she never got salmonella. Why? Because salmonella was too scared of her.  It's like Batman. He shows us it is quite possible to be good without being nice or polite. The mistake many of us make is to assume nice and good are the same thing. Truth is, the easiest thing to fake is being nice and polite. They say even the devil can quote Scripture to suit his needs, well I say he can act polite without bursting into flames too.  I've said my piece in defense of Council Bluffs. But I've been around a bit and we rank as one of the top most polite cities in the United States is baffling to me. We're OK, but no. 5?  These lists are so arbitrary that their results are meaningless, but somehow, it just isn't NICE to say so. Well, at least it is honest.  The cities on this list were chosen by travelers who, for some reason, just felt like calling and nominating a city for being polite? That's nice, but what is the standard? How dow we know where they come from isn't just so much worse than us that we look good in comparison. Every time I have traveled, I fully expected the cities I was visiting to be rude and they all surprised me. I thought Washington, D.C. was more polite than any other because a convenience store clerk got all chatty with me about being from Iowa and a woman in a restaurant asked me to open her bottled water for her and then thanked me. That's it. That's all I have to go on and I am still impressed. If I lived there, perhaps I would see the real D.C. Common decency is necessary for any society to move along smoothly, but niceness and politeness are not. Decency is doing the right thing and politeness is just being nice when you do whatever it is you were going to do anyway.  Nothing wrong with saying "please," "thank you" and "do you mind if I don't?" once in a while, but let's not pretend that's all we need to make a decent society because the truth is, it is a lot harder than that. -Greg Jerrett is a Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      My goal for today, in addition to edifying the audience if not actually wowwing a few of you with some word play (yes "wowwing" is a word), is to get out of the office as soon as possible so that I might go home and start nailing crooked pieces of wood over all the doors and windows in my palatial country home while praying to the god of unexpected late season snowfalls that I have enough Diet Mountain Dew to last until Monday. But you know what they say about March coming in like a lion. Personally, I do not believe that March will go out like a lamb. In my experience, if March comes in like a lion, it usually goes out like a much older, nastier lion with a predisposition towards anti-social behavior, heavy drinking and violence. It seems the least I can do on this the one year anniversary of my employment at the Daily Nonpareil is "keep it real," as the young people are wont to say, as fast as humanly possible.  It hardly seems like a year has gone by. That is typical. Once you get settled down into a career track, it doesn't matter whether you are 18 or 42, the rest of your life just starts to fly like lightning bugs in the grill of an 86 Caprice Classic. One day you are full of hopes and dreams and the next, you are dangerously close to retirement hoping no one who manages your 401k plan invested in Enron. This is, of course, one of the best arguments for unemployment on the books. Not for me though. I, like many other people, have a destiny to fulfill and it does not involve sitting around watching copious amounts of television eating even more copious amounts of cheese. I save that for the weekends, my friends, and I suggest you do the same. I was 24 when I showed up for my interview. Now I am 33. It has been a tough year, but one full of lessons. One of those lessons is never turn your back on a fellow reporter in a story meeting unless you want a Bic pen shoved between your third and fourth vertebrae. Reporters are an opportunistic bunch and if they see a chance to knock you down a peg, poach a story, cripple you or eat for free they will take it. I also had the single greatest meal of my life this year. Yes, it was free and that made it all the tastier. Going completely off diet, I sampled the cuisine of five gourmet chefs at Harrah's one afternoon. It was almost worth risking blindness just for the creme broulle. I am not much for sweets but only profuse swearing can describe how mind-boggling delicious that was. Don't even get me started on the lemon mousse, I'm still having flashbacks. I have met some really cool people this year. Council Bluffs has more character per square inch than "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"  Brig. Gen. Reg Urschler from the Commemorative Air Force was enough character for one year, but then I never could stand abusive, pickled flyboys. He completes me or at least tried to make me look like a complete fool. Good job, Herr General. Like THAT'S hard to do. Deb Danielsen, owner of the Wickham-DeVol House on the corner of Willow and Bluff tripped my trigger. At first, I admit she struck me as "just rich" and I tend to not get all gushy around people just because they have more stuff. Then I found her to be one of those truly unique individuals who cares enough about her city to start a civic improvement plan all on her own. And what a house. I just want to wander around her yard looking in the windows, but then I remember that's wrong. I met Sara Gathers somewhere in the hinterland between Crescent and Underwood early on when she was fighting leukemia. I did three stories on her and the final one was about her death. I have to admit, it hit me harder than I expected because she was the first person I ever wrote a story on with the idea of helping them out and that is why I got into this profession. It was the first time it worked and I felt pumped when the family sent me a thank you note. "All in a day's work" I thought as if that were the end of it. That kind of thing never ends.  Don't even let's get started on 9/11. Bill Ramsey, Wilbur Chaney, Dick Peterson, George Lee, the list goes on like Julia Roberts at the Oscars. The most important thing I've learned in the last year is that hard work is for suckers, working SMART is where it's at. You can bang your head against a wall all you want, it doesn't mean people have to respect what you do. Oh they might respect the fact that you work hard, it doesn't mean they aren't wondering why you didn't put out something better for all that hard work.  In the years to come, I am going to work towards becoming untouchable and bulletproof, a teflon-covered writer with no seams, cracks or spaces for bats to wriggle into. Think Mark Twain, Hunter S. Thompson, Leonard Cohen and H.L. Mencken, they could say or do anything because no matter what else was true, people knew they were telling the truth. That is a legacy worth working for.  So if I had to sum up Greg: Year One, it would read: I would rather be untouchable than rich any day but if I could be both, that would totally rock. And what is in store for Greg: Year Two? I fully expect to have a sophomore slump steeped in the deepest, blackest depression only to awaken some three months hence transformed into a giant cockroach, then we'll see who has the last laugh. Ha, ha, ha, yes we will. Oh and if possible, I will find that creme broulle recipe. Lachaim! -Greg Jerrett is Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      I was hanging out with my "book club" friends Thursday night drinking copious amounts of "tea" and "promising" them that nothing we talked about would end up in this column today when it suddenly occurred to me that my life is an open book. "My life is an open book, ladies," I said. "And this is my life." "It's our lives, too," said one of the more precocious members who wished not to be identified lest her husband discover she was not talking about "Little Women" but downing "tea" after "tea" while we shouted "CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!" "What's your point?" I asked. Because really isn't that what most things come down to? What is the point? Life, death, work, security, patriotism, art, writing, production, love, death, marriage, fear and loathing. It's all enough to make one quite depressed. That is life in modern America and some pundits have suggested that depression is merely a reasonable byproduct of unreasonable times. Since Sept. 11, fewer people doubt that. I learned the hard way after years of guilt-ridden miasma that you cannot live your life in a prison of your own design.  I discovered about eight years that chief among my many problems was chronic depression. It was no one's fault I had this condition, but we live in a society that has certain opinions about such maladies and likes to place the blame, as it were. Problems that present themselves with symptoms of a mental nature are viewed with as much suspicion and fear as witchcraft. In fact, witchcraft was often blamed for everything from obsessive compulsive disorder to schizophrenia at one time. And why not? Bad chemicals, touchy brain functions and unbalanced hormones might as well be demons, imps and witchery to this day for us much as most people are willing to understand them. You see, "craziness," as it turns out, is just another symptom. When you break your leg and roll around on the ground screaming and crying, no one goes "what's wrong with that guy? He must be crazy!" Of course not, that would be ludicrous in the extreme.  Yet we tend to view people who are even just clinically depressed with suspicion as if what depressives have is a mystery best not to thought of. In many ways, it is still an unsolved mystery because as a society we aren't quite sure what to do with people with mental illnesses and the best way to treat different forms of depression is still up for debate. But even as recently as the end of the last century, the best cure for depression was just shocking the hell out of a guy until he "snapped out of it." It's like headaches. One century they're caused by evil spirits and in the next an aspirin stops that myth. One day, I hope to see most illnesses with behavioral symptoms to be as easily diagnosed and treated as a headache, but until that point, the best thing we can all hope for now is a little rational thought.  Depression is a sickness in its own right, but it is also a symptom of many other illnesses. I know, because I have been a chronic depressive since about 13. In my case, my liver does not produce enough of a particular enzyme to regulate mood swings as well as most people. Just knowing this has made my life a lot easier. I try to keep an even keel like Mr. Spock on "Star Trek" so my hot Vulcan blood does not begin to boil. I eschew "getting too happy" because I'm like a ship without a rudder or a car with wonky steering on an icy road. If I keep it going straight, I'm cool, but if I start sliding and don't turn into the skid just right, I'll end up in the ditch.  Luckily, I don't have to worry about ending up in the Missouri River any more, but time was that was a major concern. My first major experience with the kind of derailment depression could cause began in my mid-20s. My wicked liver was causing me problems one of which was called "running thoughts."  "Running thoughts" are thoughts you can't quite stop thinking about - a conversation, that guy who cut you off in traffic, a logic problem - until you upset yourself or at least waste an hour thinking about something most people would just "let go of." For a writer, this is not the worst problem one can have if controlled. It leads to some great, realistic dialogue, at least that's what "Old Settler" author John Henry Redwood said about me. Just thought I'd throw that out there. Sniff. Long story short, through medication, education and a rubber band around my wrist, I was able to retrain myself. I would get to thinking about something I shouldn't, I'd snap that rubber band and sing "Sunny Days," the theme song from "Sesame Street." Sound crazy? Sure, but what my "book club" came to realize is that everything is relative. While those who seek treatment for their illnesses might get stuck with a nasty label, they are not necessarily any crazier than the average person who might suffer in silence from any number of maladies physical or mental. Most people will see their doctor for a cold before they would see him because they heard voices.

      Don't mind me, I'm just a little on the randy side today after a stunning quasi-victory in Des Moines last week when my "corporal punishment" or "beat on the brat" column garnered for me (and by extention the Nonpareil and all C.B.-ers) a second place Master Columnist Award in the Iowa Newspaper Association's annual competition.  Nonpareil photographer Scott Berger got First Place in the Best Feature Photo category. Much celebrating was to be had in the hotel bar of the downtown Des Moines Marriott that night I can tell you. Newspaper people like to drink and a good excuse makes the drinking more fun, celebratory and guilt free. Monday's papers across the state were full of tales of glory as tooters blew their own horns. "First in this, second in that," they cried in humble fonts. "The judges said we rocked because blah, blah, blah." And why not? "If you do not blow your own horn, as my sainted grandmother used to say, "don't expect anyone else to blow it either. Then again nobody likes a bragger now cut my toenials!" Good times. Thankfully, mentioning one's awards, compliments, kudos and "attaboys" don't count as bragging until they make up at least 75 percent of one's repetoire. But that's life in the Midwest for you.  In less pent up and frustrated parts of the world, "doing things" is not considered hubris. The Lord did not start smiting people for pride until they moved to the Central Plains states; before that, if you were smote, it was most likely for sodomy or issues related to paganism. So it goes. It was a proud night for me and mine and I'll tell you why. I did not have to come home after college and work at my home town paper. I had other offers and "sure things" for more money. Had I waited a while longer, more offers would have presented themselves. When you can write, design, layout pages and edit, the world is your oyster or at least your stuffed pork chop. The truth is, I work at the Nonpareil because I chose the Nonpareil over everything else. I chose to come home and apply my efforts where I grew up, where my family lives, where my roots are. Sure, I could have made more elsewhere, but I believed and still believe to this day (though faith has a way of waxing and waning on occasion) that I made the right choice. Not the most convenient one, not the most profitable one, not the coolest choice and not the easy one, I assure you.  For while I believe we should all put our best efforts into our community, that sentiment is not always shared and that is frustrating. Council Bluffs has a problem believing in itself and I want to see that problem eradicated. It IS possible to improve one's station through force of will. If you believe, things can happen.  Piddly little things can stop will dead in its tracks, things like small-mindedness, apathy, pre-judgment and, worst of all, bullheaded determination to see that nothing and no one else gets the chance to have something you yourself are not willing to go after. I love Council Bluffs. I love the people I meet every day, the ones I turned into characters in little college plays including a full-length play I called "Last Chance" that won a Commendation for Excellence in Playwriting from the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. That wasn't just my award, that was our award and this isn't schmooz. When the Ames Tribune arts and entertainment editor asked me where I "got my ideas" I told her "I'm from Council Bluffs and when I need dialogue I just think about conversations I heard growing up at diners, in school, at garages, junkyards or grocery stores and I type as fast as I can." So when I tell you about the things I did and do and still want to accomplish, you will forgive me if I seem to be overreaching myself, but no one ever knows exactly how far they CAN reach until they have reached too far. With that said, I've got my Blackjack Gum, my Wild Cherry Pepsi and I'm ready to pump up the volume. Lately, I've been noticing something disturbing to me. Maybe you haven't thought about it and if I bring it up maybe you will agree or disagree. No harm done either way. Frankly, it irritates me to go into Council Bluffs restaurants, bars, delis, coffee shops and other busineses and not see a Nonpareil in the newspaper rack where the Omaha World-Herald or some other non-local paper is.  I talk to people like Deb Danielsen who is renovating her historic Council Bluffs home, the Wickham-DeVol house, for $1.2 million dollars. That is not just for her but for all of us. That's money she could have sunk into the stock market and used to moved to Key West but she stayed and spent her money and her effort here.  So it galls me to know the average burger joint, coffee house and cafe won't spend $10.25 a month to support the local paper. They give that cash to the World-Herald or USAToday or some other paper that has no vested interest in our community. You are fine. You're reading your paper right now and thanks for that. But I have an idea and it just might be crazy enough to work. The next time you go to a restaurant, bar or ANY business that offers newspapers for its customers and your hometown Nonpareil is NOT one of them, ask them why? Ask them to carry it. Ask them if they would like you to take your business across the river or to a business that has enough pride in Council Bluffs to invest $10.25 out of its monthy budget.  This isn't just for me. This isn't for my "job security" nor is it some cheap ploy to boost circulation. I'm no corporate shil. I don't do enough things for money, honestly, but this isn't one of them. Do this for your town. Do it for pride's sake, not the bragging kind, but the basic kind that makes you get out of bed every day.  Because we could all just move away to some other city or state that's cool, prosperous and entertaining 24 hours a day. It takes people with true grit like us to stay put and build that city ourselves.

      The more I hear about the Enron scandal and the wickedness of its CEO Ken Lay, the more it makes me glad I chose the ethically and morally liberating field of journalism. Oh sure, you laugh, but most of the bad stuff about journalism comes from your more fringe-y elements in the TV and tabloid segments of the market.  By and large, what goes on in the day-to-day world of the professional journalist is about as questionable as the public's right to know in the first place. Business may be the business of America, but our puritanical predecessors, the mavens who invented capitalism, would blow succotash if they could see what kind of crimes are committed these days in the name of the almighty dollar. Marketing defective products, poisoning the environment, buying political favors, relocating American jobs to third world countries, sweatshops... the list goes on. You see, capitalism used to not exist because capital did not exist. Capital is basically another way of saying "huge, ungodly sums of cash that pretty much give you the power to do whatever you want." Calvinists, not desiring the base things of this world yet possessed of a work ethic so powerful that children were considered lazy reprobates if they were not permanently doubled over from laboring long hard days in the field by the ripe old age of 10. As a result, they accumulated massive wealth they had no intention of spending until time passed and the Calvinism wore off of their descendants. Religious determinism ended and corporations were born and over time, a new ethical question began to form as well. That question can be more or less summarized thusly, "when a group of people get together and no single one of them can be held accountable for policy, how can the behavior of large groups be controlled." It is all about control. In our world, we are all controlled by fear, largely, and cash, not so largely. I want to have great sums of money and while I could rob a bank for it, I do not because 1) robbing a bank is wrong and 2) I am a gutless punk afraid of the consequences of my action. Sure we would all like to believe that we largely do not do things considered wrong because of ethics and morals, but in the final analysis, most people are only able to determine what is right and wrong according to the code of law. If it is in there, it must be moral or immoral according to whether or not you are punished for doing it or not doing it. The problem with some large corporations we have seen over and over again is that in order to punish a corporation for say, making a car they know is going to kill people, is that to punish the corporation means that many people will be hurt who are not really guilty of anything. One might well ask, couldn't the single individual in that company be found, blamed, charged and punished? You would think so, but that is the beauty behind corporate responsibility. Plausible deniability. Ken Lay, the CEO of Enron has been playing both sides of the political spectrum for years. He has a carefully cultivated "good-natured bumpkin" aura about him that most people recognize as false.  He is currently busy kicking this prefabricated excuse into overdrive by trying to claim his company was so large he could not possibly have known about the cooked books, creative accounting and artificially inflated stocks in spite of the fact that any CEO worth his salt knows what his business is up to. A recent Newsweek article reported that the great fear among lawmakers, economic analysts and other decent folk is that what is happening now with Enron may not be one isolated instance but the way business is often conducted. We may be so deeply mired in corruption not even a monster truck 4 x 4 with space shuttle jets could unstick us. Our society frowns on crime. From our early days of rounding up and brutally killing people we were pretty sure might have done something wrong to our modern system of scientifically-backed jurisprudence, we have strived to root out wrong-doing and bad people. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Right now, thousands of Enron employees who worked for years in good faith for a company that was a house of cards designed with great deliberation to bilk millions from an unsuspecting country, buy politicians of all stripes and subvert energy policy for decades are out of luck while their former bosses line up to plead the fifth to avoid cushy white-collar punishments at resort style prisons. How many good people will suffer? How many of them will be thrust into poverty?  We need to treat these white-collar criminals with same brutality and harshness we treat thieves, murderers and rapists because law and order is far too lenient with these fancy pants. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      If the snow dump Mother Nature dropped on us Thursday has proved nothing else, it is that I am an awesome driver. I am not just a great driver as far as stunts and wheelies are concerned but it's the little things I excel at. The two-second following rule, turning into a skid, pumping the breaks - all good rules especially in bad weather.  Even when the weather isn't horrid, I rock behind the wheel. I use my turn signal, stop BEFORE the crosswalks not in them and I never cut people off if I can help it. On the other side of the planet, energy exists as either wave or particle. Waves and particles disrupt or change other waves and particles, which is why leaving your television on all night keeps the ghosts away. That is basic science. There is another kind of bad voodoo energy that seems incapable of disruption and that is road rage. For some reason or other people are just ungodly mad about something these days. Who can blame them? We live in uncertain times. Mad bombers aside, this economy is no picnic and who likes to feel like chattel? I would like to claim to be above any and all road rage, but I am not. In fact, as I type this column my fingers hurt from all of the flipping off I've been doing lately. I think I'm getting carpal tunnel syndrome and may soon have to wear a special brace when I drive. The problem is the force I use. In order to signal one's disgust at other drivers with authority, one must first brace the middle finger against the thumb and then with a flicking motion move the middle finger into the full upright position. This gives that most offensive of digits a sort of lightening quickness.  It's a kind of magic that makes the finger almost appear from nowhere. I don't live far from the Nonpareil building, in fact, I live in a cave under the Dodge House and enter and exit only under the cover of darkness in my jet-powered Caprice Classic... not unlike Batman. It takes me five minutes to get to and from work, yet in that time, I will invariably come across drivers who get livid at the slightest perceived failure of other drivers to conform to their Utopian idea of traffic flow. It isn't just drivers. Last week this otherwise lovely octogenarian gentleman had a conniption fit because I stopped a bit quickly in front of his crosswalk. I didn't enter it, just stopped quickly. He stood looking far off to the south as I tooted my horn letting him know I was more than happy to allow him to cross, he WAS there first and I believe that is his right. I tooted my horn pulling him gently from his reverie. A toot that said, hey, I care about your health and welfare on this chilly day.  Then he said something while waving his arms I couldn't quite make out that sounded like "ducking glass bird, thumb in the ditch?!" Needless to say, I was stunned and wondered what a ducking glass bird might be. Of course, I flipped him off. Didn't want to, felt I owed it to him. That was when I felt the pop in my knuckle that my doctor, a famous Jordanian biathlete, said was the worst case of repetitive stress disorder he had seen outside of one particular baboon at the Henry Doorly Zoo. I would have to take it easy. On the way out of the parking lot, his nurse cut me off. She knew what she was doing. So I raised the back of my hand, lowered my thumb and pinkie finger and shouted, "Read between the lines, Florence Nightingale!" On the way home, I was tailgated by a red SUV with vanity plates that read "JETSKRS." I wondered what "jetsuckers" was supposed to mean as I applied my break light to no avail. A little trick I learned in driver's ed circa 1984, not actually slowing down, just giving the impression that if I were to stop ... watch out! Then jetsuckers passed me in the turning lane of North Broadway as I was about to make my appropriately signaled lane changer doing 50 m.p.h. in a 35 m.p.h. zone. I know because after I missed my turn I had nothing better to do than follow jetsucker, gauge jetsuckers speed and write down jetsuckers license plate number to turn in to the cops for reckless driving.   Two seconds, folks, it's not too much to ask. Like most things, road rage is a symptom of a greater problem. It's like attention deficit disorder for adult drivers - a critical impatience combined with far too much horsepower and an insatiable desire to control the road. Perhaps Ritalin is the answer. It's as though life, being an uncontrollable mess most days, should at least be serene on the streets and when it is not, artificially empowered by huge engines and a ton of metal, we become a tool for vengeance. Well, a tool anyway. Recently, a truck driver smashed another truck driver between the rig and the other trucker's after a road rage altercation. This is not simple rage, this is sadistic revenge fantasy stuff for people who spend WAY too much time on the road. We could all advocate taking it easier but that is not usually an option for Americans. We like to go and go fast lest we feel unproductive. So it goes. Think before you get in your car and think twice before you get mad. Don't take things personally and try not to be unreasonable on either side of the fence. Going too fast or too slow are equally likely to irritate others. And remember that while flipping people off feels good for a little while, it ultimately leaves you feeling empty inside, distances you from others and can tear the ligaments in your finger if you do it too hard.

       Marilyn Walker, mother of American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh told reporters Thursday, "My love for him is unconditional ... I am grateful to God that he's been brought back to his family and his home." I pray to God that if I ever take up with vicious extremists either in this country or a dirty little backwater like Afghanistan that my mother WILL stop loving me. There have to be some limits for criminey sake. Love should not be unconditional unless you are a dog and even then some might argue that what dogs feel is not so much unconditional love as it is gratitude for kibble and the sincere hope of seeing more kibble soon. The case of John Walker Lindh has given pundits fuel for their bipartisan arguments. Raised in "liberal" Marin County in "liberal" northern California, Lindh's sojourn from curious high school boy to Taliban soldier and potential terrorist could only have happened under the auspices of insufficiently strict "liberal" parenting. What that says about Timothy McVeigh's good conservative Christian upbringing, however, is usually viewed as off point by conservative pundits uninterested in viewing McVeigh as their doing. So it goes. Lindh is not the poster boy for failed "liberal" parenting practices and neither side of the political spectrum should be using him for their purposes.  I find the middle ground is where the truth often resides amidst the briars and brambles of half-truths wildly spun by the politically ambitious. It is tricky ground. I have no political ambitions beyond possibly running for school board or maybe mayor of Council Bluffs, but that is in the way far future and only if I do not have to compete against the unstoppable political juggernaut that is Tom Hanafan. Since I have no political career to be destroyed, I can still tell the truth as I see it. As Joey Ramone said, "Hey! Ho! Let's go!" If John Walker Lindh should be used for anything, it is as an example of how regardless a parent's personal political, religious or moral beliefs, they should be teaching them to their children. The one thing Lindh seems to have been lacking was direction of any kind. His parents encouraged him to do whatever he wanted and even when they started to wonder about his choices, they said nothing. Kids just want to figure things out and they will test your boundaries to find out what flies and what doesn't. This is why kids spend so much time pretending they already know everything and telling adults "you just don't understand" even though most adults certainly understand that when they were kids, they were largely clueless.  Most of us remember all too well what it was like to be a kid trying to get a handle on the world and, boy, didn't we hate it when adults told us what was what? It is hard to admit that when I was a child I not only spoke as a child and did childish things, I was not competent to find my own way unguided and I think I was more qualified than most. Encouraging children to get out and explore their world and figure out their place in it is one thing, taking off their training wheels before they even get out of the gate is another. Many of us need a sounding board to bounce ideas off of. Many more of us are sheep who must be herded unerringly toward the right goals because unattended we would likely walk around in circles until bad men used us for their own ends. When it comes to religion, it is especially important to guide children even if you aren't interested in just making them whatever you are because your parents and grandparents were one and you want them to be one too.  It is too hard to distinguish between an established philosophy with good street cred and your average fly-by-night scam. That's how cults make their money off of people looking for answers. When your children have questions, are you ready with answers? What is our religion? What do we believe? Is there a God? How can I tell the difference between right and wrong?  Questions will come up and when they do, you might want to have something prepared because in the teen-age wasteland we call America, Baba O'Reilly, your kids are going to find answers somewhere and if it isn't with you, it will be with people who do drugs, experiment with sex, belong to extremist religious/political groups or work for Enron. The pitfalls are many and treacherous. Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain that is the directionless teenage American life, Lindh wandered through the desert with only blind encouragement for guidance. Even First Lady Laura Bush expressed her sympathy for Lindh's parents as if kids do the darnedest things and no matter how hard one might try, sometimes they just grow up to be bad seeds. I guess she feels compelled to reserve judgment since her own kid was caught drinking underage. Apples and oranges or just different spots along the same road? You be the judge. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. He may be contacted at 328-1811 ext. 279 or by e-mail at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      I will state up front that I am not easily impressed, swayed or amused. Life can be a grind. Frivolity and joviality are for children. So is hell according to Pat Benatar, but that is another column. For grown-ups like us, melancholy and depression are the rule and forced politeness is about the best we can offer our fellow man.  Moments of joy are too special to have all the time anyway, try as we might. Keep your eyes on the prize! It pays off in the long run to believe in the power of positive self-realization. Notice I did not say "it pays to be positive." I hate that sentiment. It means nothing and is the mantra of shiny, happy people who have lived in a place all of their lives and still say things like, "there's no NORTH Broadway," "what's the Viaduct?" "Brewski's is a drive-thru what?" and "I went to a private school in Omaha." We can easily mock these people because they don't read our paper. By "our paper" I mean the one that is yours and mine, the Nonpareil. That's positive, huh? Sunshine doesn't mean as much without the occasional cloudy day, but remembering that it can't rain all the time gives you enough hope to make it through the metaphorical darkness into the metaphorical light. Not to go all Tony Robbins or Friedrich Nietzsche on you here, but it is possible to will yourself into prosperity, happiness, success, love or just about anything else you want to get into by believing that all things are possible. Because the truth is, they are. Ever see "A&E's Biography?" How many Americans were born poverty-stricken, disease-ridden to child-beating parents, suffered several false starts, a handful of failures, a bankruptcy or two and still managed to leave a lasting legacy or at least a legacy worthy of A&E. Colonel Sanders, Mark Twain and Harry S. Truman come to mind. They overcame much trouble by sheer will. When I came home for the first time in three years over Christmas 2000, I found the "Council Bluffs - Iowa's Leading Edge" commercials on TV to be a slick, appropriate and, dare I say, inspiring effort. The slogan, created by public relations firm Meyocks and Priebe of Des Moines, rocks harder than Cheap Trick live at the Budokan, my friends, and shows what is possible for a town like ours when we shoot for a higher level. Kudos to the Chamber of Commerce for realizing that if you want to hit somebody in the nose, you gotta aim for the back of the head. It beats some of the slogans and taglines I would have devised in a fit of realism. A quick survey of the Nonpareil newsroom came up with several alternatives. Each begins with "Council Bluffs ..." "... we're meth-ariffic!" "... not Omaha - yet." "... you gotta problem with that?" "... one for me and one for my homies." "... we don't smell like Lake Manawa." "... ain't nothin' wrong with that!" "... take what you want, but eat what you take." "... city of dreams." "... home of wicked satire." "... the truck stop at the crossroads of the world." "... there's no place like home. There's no place like home. C'mon, work already!" You get the idea. It takes a special kind of person to write really good propaganda. Anybody can just make stuff up, but making up stuff that works? That changes the way people think and feel about the exact same thing they hated or ignored moments before? Pure skill.  I can't help but giggle when I fudge. In my own life, I have found the use of a quote board helpful in making myself believe I can do anything or be amusing on command. This began at the Iowa State Daily and was a great way to remember just how funny we were.  You have to keep on it or those corkers you come up with spontaneously will be lost forever. Do this at your school or place of work. Whenever anyone makes a funny write it down, tack it to a cork board, tape it to the wall or tattoo it across your chest as tangible proof of how much joy you are capable of creating day in and day out.  Don't worry hipsters, it is just self-congratulatory enough to avoid the whole "Chicken Soup for the Soul" effect. I mentioned Twain earlier. Iowa Public Television is showing Ken Burn's "Mark Twain" on Sunday from 2 to 6 in the afternoon. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It tells the story of one of the greatest Americans that ever lived and how each of our lives has been influenced by his work. Set your VCRs, this one should not be missed. - Greg Jerrett is a Daily Nonpareil staff writer. He may be contacted at 328-1811 ext. 279 or by e-mail at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      The subject of abortion has reared its ugly head in Council Bluffs with the decision of the Planned Parenthood office on N. 16th to offer abortion services. Letters have been written. Opinions have been expressed. A small group of protesters has occasionally stood their ground outside Planned Parenthood and good for them. Peaceful protest is essential to our American way of life. None of this is a surprise. People feel strongly about abortion on both sides. Most sensible people know to avoid talking about it to avoid a hassle. Lord knows I should.  I have gone seven months without mentioning abortion. As a columnist at ISU, I mentioned it once a month, but those were highly politicized times. With our "anything goes" attitude, riling the masses was as common as ordering pizza. Here in the professional portion of my career, I haven't brought up abortion because there seemed to be little point. What could be achieved?  The sides are adamantly divided, imbued with a moral sense of righteousness and thoroughly determined to win at all costs. Since there is not likely to be any kind of end to the debate let alone consensus, it would be more trouble than it is worth to take sides publicly, right? That, however, is the wrong attitude to take. Not just for social commentators, but for all of us.  As Americans, we should all be in the business of encouraging debate. It is our birthright. It is our national credo. It is the First Amendment to our beloved Constitution. The more hopeless an issue, the more endless the debate, the less likely unity of various positions seems, the more important it is to debate that issue because there is a principle at stake. Did the Suffragettes suffer force feedings for nothing? I  think not. At one point, the cause of women's equality seemed about as likely to work as Anna Nicole Smith. Today, women have the same right to choose not to vote as men. Ah, sweet liberty. People do switch sides. Key people. Religion in public schools, gay rights, immigration, the legalization of hemp, Coke vs. Pepsi, all issues that have changed and have changed us in return. I will eventually get to my position on abortion, but right now I want you to listen to an idea that could come from anyone on either side. The problem with the entire abortion debate is that both sides of the mainstream debate are kind of right. I say mainstream, because without question, people who kill doctors and blow up clinics are wrong and no one should condone that. Pro-lifers are right when they say each abortion represents a potential human life that will never have the chance to be. Pro-choicers are right when they say a woman has a right to choose what happens to her own body. The question is one of how we perceive the issue and that comes down to moral absolutes. Are there any? Are there just some? No one LIKES abortion just as no one LIKES laser eye surgery or colon examinations. But we like knowing the procedures are there if we need them. It would be wonderful if we lived in a world where every pregnancy was a planned and every fetus became a child that was wanted and loved. Unfortunately, that is not the case and back when abortions were illegal, they were still performed. A recent letter writer mentioned abortionists. Abortionists were people who performed abortions in the dark days before trained doctors could do so legally. The letter writer referred to women dying of botched procedures, something that has happened so rarely since legalization as to be a non-issue.  Death was the issue before Roe vs. Wade because a woman had no idea who was performing the procedure on her. That has changed today. Women performed abortions on themselves and would again without legal abortion. No matter how many laws are passed to prevent it, abortions will be performed. It is true that untold numbers of fetuses have not come to term, but untold lives have been saved thanks to legalized abortion. It would be audacious to claim there is no human potential in every fetus. Of course there is potential. There is also potential in every sperm and ovum. The question is not about what could be, but what is. What is a person? Who counts and when do they start counting? That is when this whole thing turns into a religious argument about the soul. When does it enter the body? At conception? At three months? DOES it enter? Do we even have souls and if so do they make us human? Anciently, the Greeks believed a fetus had no soul until the Quickening when the baby began kicking. Seems primitive now, but the idea of "conception" is a relatively new one only modern science has been able to confirm under the microscope. What if science proves Hindus correct and the soul is something that exists in everything in small measure like an energy field that separates and combines as needed? What happens to reproductive rights then? Sound ridiculous? It should. Abortion should be treated like any religious issue and that means the choice to practice a belief must be left to the individual. -Greg Jerrett is Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      The funniest thing I heard Thursday night was "when you look at the stats, the Huskers actually beat Miami in the second half." Bwah?!  If they did, the Huskers lost so bad in the first half that it clearly didn't matter. I don't know about you, but I am tired of hearing about the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Thirty-three years is quite enough of this yearly ritual of replacing all of the actual broadcast news with Husker stories.  I know there are a great many of my fellow Iowans who feel the same way, but we rarely hear your opinions on the matter because there is no forum for that kind of counterpoint.  Instead, we are fed a constant stream of "Go Big Red" because we have the misfortune to get almost all of our broadcast media from Omaha, Neb.  So let me be the one to say on your behalf, "give it a rest already, I'm trying to watch Letterman."  Heaven forfend we find a steady stream of news from Iowa. Decade after decade it is the same thing. Honestly, win, lose or draw ... who cares? And if they do care, why do they care? Last night's game against Miami was over around 10:30, but KETV went on until midnight with meager commentary, talking to people in bars about what a disappointment this loss was. Who cares what a guy in a bar thinks? It isn't like hops make you Howard Cosell.  I appreciate the average Nebraskan's love of the Huskers. Besides a thriving trucking industry, what else is there to get excited about over there besides Carhenge? If you are going to live vicariously through something it might as well be college football. But the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has so much more to be proud of. They invented "Cliffs Notes." It's true! You know, those black and yellow guides students have been using for years to study literature instead of the actual literature itself? The people who confound me are Iowans who catch "Big Red Fever." Trust me when I tell you this is strictly a southwest Iowa phenomenon. Big Red Fever must be like hemorrhagic fever or ebola. It must be through contact only.  Whatever happened to supporting the home team? Even if they stink, they are still the home team.  Winning is irrelevant. The Chicago Cubs stink it up real good, but they have one of the most loyal fan bases in the history of sports or so I'm told. To be a Cubs fan is to know what loyalty truly means. Cyclones, Hawkeyes, Panthers, just pick one. Personally, I would feel a little like a traitor rooting for Nebraska to beat an Iowa team. But maybe that's just me, I give priority to things like loyalty and patriotism. It is a blessing as well as a curse, I guess. And exactly why does the morning zoo crew at KIWR, Iowa Western Radio, 98.7 The River keep saying they are in Omaha? As far as I know, they are so far out west, they are practically not in C.B. any more.  Yet for the last couple of weeks, the dynamic duo on The River's Big Party Show have called people in Colorado, told them they were calling from a radio station in Omaha and Husker-bated them. You are not a commercial radio station, KIWR, you are an Iowa college station. You aren't hopping across the river any time soon. You are now and always will be a Council Bluffs station. So act like it. You are sitting at the cool table. Quit pretending to be from Omaha like some sad college freshman fibbing about his hometown to sound cool. Lay off the "Go Big Red" crap, it's boring and we get enough of that already. Try pretending you have a vested interest in serving the community in which you reside.  Karl Marx said that religion was the opiate of the masses but that was before the advent of 24-hour sports channels. Now the constant watching of sports keeps people from news that isn't entertainment. It keeps them from getting involved in their communities.  I played a little football back in the day. Go Kirn Eagles! Playing sports obviously builds character, look at all the saints who play for the Huskers. But watching sports all the time seems kind of futile unless you have a gambling addiction. Then it makes sense in a sad sort of way. At least when you watch your local team, you are supporting your community. Time was that college football was just like high school football. The players were students, REAL students not just excuses to build a winning team through charity scholarships. Today, college football is just an industry attached to colleges for the purpose of making money. Not money for the school, but money for the athletic department of that school. It has created this false upperclass of students who disrupt class when they go, act like little tin gods and commit crimes with impunity Even at my alma mater, Iowa State, football players did what they pleased when they had next to nothing to show for it. Big pimpin' on campus in cars paid for by Iowa State through some loophole. A good season for Iowa State was when no one on the football team committed a crime the press found out about.

      I don't know about you, but here it is 2001, almost 2002, and I still feel like 2000 A.D. is way far in the future.  It's like there are two different 2001s. One is this mundane reality we exist in where the date is just something we put on our checks to make them legitimate. The other 2001 is the stylized vision of the future we were all counting on for decades, an imaginary landmark always 20 minutes into the future, never quite attainable. I remember when I was a kid sitting in my sixth grade class talking about the future. There we were on the brink of 1980, a magical number if ever I heard one. It was the first future-sounding year I was to live in because let's face it, even in 1977, 1978 sounded like old news while every year since 1980 has seemed as new and unusual as Stardate 8917.56. Anything was possible. Our teacher said a decade change was quite exciting when you were an amateur and the first one is always special. A century change must about knock your socks off, but we were all in line to still be alive for the new millennium, a prospect no one alive at that time could describe. How old would we be? What would we be doing. I will be 33 in 2001, I thought. Why, I'll probably be married to a really good-looking woman and have kids almost my age by that time. I will probably be living in my own house with my very own personal 8-track player in my den just like "Brady Bunch," flying back and forth between the moon and mars on business trips with alien cultures. Thank God I didn't know the truth back then.  Had I known when I was 11 that by the time I was 33 I would be a fat diabetic just out of college for the second time living a loveless existence with no offspring to fulfill my genetic destiny or take care of me in my old age making less than my sixth grade teacher did in 1979, driving a car that DOES NOT fly, watching cooking shows, reading Batman comics, living in fear of terrorism, taking nine pills a day, addicted to nicotine and cheese while looking forward all week long to my Friday night nap, I probably would have thought twice about going to junior high and joined the circus. I don't even have a dog, man, and I don't want one because I don't think I am ready for that kind of responsibility. It would be funny if I weren't completely serious.  The future was supposed to be a cool groove and some bits are.  Flying cars aside, we do live among some great technological advances. We couldn't conceive of having more than four TV channels when I was a kid, let alone the Internet. Having all the world's information available at your whim is certainly a smile. I have nearly 600 songs stored as MP3 files on one shiny round disk and I didn't pay for any of them. Nor should I have had to. Air Supply made their money from "All Out of Love" already, they should pay me for giving a damn 30 years after the fact. We have game systems today that make Atari and "Pong" look like beating rocks together looking for sparks.  Cells phones? Don't even get me started on how cool it is to talk to anyone, any time, any where.  Time was we thought aliens would have to give us the cure for cancer, but today more people survive than we ever thought possible. Microwave popcorn. No one would have thought THAT was possible in 1979 except for Orville Reddenbocker. The man was a visionary. It is disappointing that we still live in a world where entire nations go hungry while we shrug it off and the cost of doing business.  It would have been nice to keep the space program moving along for something more than just carting spy satellites into orbit. We should have been to Mars by now instead of just getting started on our first real space station. In the end, I guess the future we get is only as good as we make it. When I look at where I am, how I got here and where I hope I'm going, the hitches in my get-a-long were as instrumental in my course as everything that supposedly went right. Take the good and the bad together and hope for the best is about the best we COULD hope for. But a jetpack would totally rule!

      I wanted to get you something special for Christmas but since I don't know your sweater size, I decided to write you a column instead.  MERRY CHRISTMAS. The bad thing about a Christmas column is that if you don't like it, you can't return it and and even if you could exchange it, it isn't worth any more than a previously viewed copy of "Glitter" starring the questionable talents of Ms. Mariah Carey. People ask me all the time (at least the people in my head ask me all the time), Greg, what is it about Christmas that makes it such a special time of year? And I tell them, "Stuff. Getting stuff, giving stuff, eating stuff (especially stuffing . . . with gravy), watching stuff, drinking stuff with rum in it and basically hanging out." But the thing I really like about Christmas is the stuff most people do not realize. Christmas is only the greatest holiday in all of western culture because it began as the single greatest pagan holiday. In the early days of the Christian religion, things were not going so swimmingly as they are now. Believe it or not, Jesus just did not have the same appeal in the early days as he has now. In fast food terms, Jesus was like White Castle. People who liked Jesus REALLY liked him and bought him by the bag. You couldn't get Jesus everywhere, but in places where Jesus was available you would see people lined up at 2 a.m. just to get some. While Jesus had a small and very devout following, he did not rake in the followers the way a McDonald's type religion might have. The truth is that back then, there were no McDonald's. Every religion was like White Castle and A&W. Small, local and hardcore. But the Christians had the best marketing and public relations firm in the Old World working on their side and they came up with a plan. Co-opt the major holy days and sites of really popular pagan religions, replace them with Christian churches and holy days and watch what happens. This was like franchising.  Again, in fast food terms, its like when Colonel Sanders invented the fast food franchise. Rather than go through the hassle of opening a Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurant in every town, he simply sold the right to make his delicious chicken and got a share of the profits. So rather than wait the required couple of millennia for Christian holy days to develop naturally, the church took pagan holy days and showed the heathens how what they were really getting at was an intuitive kind of Christianity. The earth goddess becomes the Virgin Mary, the tannenbaum becomes the Christmas Tree, Samhain becomes All Hallow's Eve or Halloween for short. The greatest single holiday in the pagan world was what the Romans called Saturnalia. It was basically a big party at the end of the year.  It was more a celebration of childish and immoral behavior as the Romans were wont to do. The day was marked by crime, drinking and lasciviousness throughout its many incarnations through the years.  Rich people hid themselves away in fear because at this time of the year, poor people got away with coming to your house, beating you up and taking your stuff.  It was tolerated because the rich thought, "What the hell, we have it pretty good the rest of the year and if we want to keep having it pretty good the rest of the year, we better let them have our stuff." The Church took the biggest pagan holiday and made it what could only be the biggest Christian holiday and that is Jesus' birthday. The fact that Jesus was born in the summer is irrelevant. Things kept rolling as they always had only now the day was called Christmas. So in the early days, Christmas was still  all about drinking and rowdy behavior. This went on for centuries. At one point, Christmas was banned in England because it was so out of control.  Christmas was not celebrated as an American holiday until the 19th century because no one really knew what it was. It only made a comeback after a concentrated effort by officials to give Americans something fun to do in the winter. When it did make its comeback, it was almost 100 percent about wholesome kid fun. Christmas is still a big drinking holiday in Europe. In fact, an old English roommate of mine was quite surprised to find it was not on the same level as the Fourth of July and St. Patrick's day in America. In many ways, what we have done with Christmas by making it a gentle and loving holiday for kids is uniquely American. The fact that Christmas has not existed in its current state since 1 A.D. takes nothing away from Christmas for me. But as a nod toward the old ways, this year I will make my holiday turkey Wild Turkey, raise a glass to Saturnalia and get stinky while watching 24 hours of "A Christmas Story" on TNT. Merry Christmas, Council Bluffs. God bless us every one. - Greg Jerrett is a Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      As promised, the answers to last week's questions about my Hawaiian vacation. A couple things went wrong. A few things went right. Turkey doesn't taste better in the tropics, it's too damn hot. "Pass the stuffing" in Korean is "stuffing chu seo." I don't even know if I would want to work and live in Hawaii. Though my T-shirt says I am proud to be Samoan, I am really just happy to see you. I will do a complete travelogue - including all the dirty stuff - in a special C section story in a couple weeks. That way I can run some color photos and have more room to ramble. Speaking of rambling... H.L. Mencken, one of the greatest American literary journalists who ever lived, once wrote that the average person never thinks an original thought in his entire life. Rather, people string together cliches, bits and pieces they've heard or read elsewhere. We call these bits and pieces "sound bites" today because few people read any thing in Danielle Steel novels or TV Guide that are actually worth repeating. We now know that space is curved, because this week, linear thought extended so far that it came back and bit its own tail. In response to a Nonpareil editorial that suggested civil liberties might be important in America, a reader responded there is something more important than civil liberties and that is living. I'm confused. Is it just me? I thought America was where we LIKED freedom. I remember when we used to say it was worth dying for. Roll over George Washington. Do a double take Tom Jefferson. I guess America is just another country where where surrender is an option and getting by is enough.  What are we France? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't America the country where we have occasionally gone to war to protect democracy in other countries?  Have we not, once in a while, expected our young men to fight and die for freedom in places like Germany, the Pacific, Korea, Vietnam and Kentucky. Do we not often utter such sentiments as "Give me liberty or give me death?" So what is happening in American? Let's take a look at Mohammed Irshaid, one of these detainees who has been held because one or two factors made him suspicious, not because he was actually suspected of terrorist activities. Irshaid is profiled in the Dec. 10 edition of Newsweek in an article called "Justice kept in the dark." For 22 years, Irshaid has been living in the United States working as a civil engineer. He went to college in Ohio, lives in New York and has three children who are all American. Had he been an Irishman who came ashore near the end of the 19th Century, he would have been considered an American already, but immigration what it is today, it takes money, tests and renouncing all ties to one's homeland. On Nov. 6, he was arrested at his place of work by federal agents because his visa had expired and they said they had information that linked him to a terrorist plot..  He was tossed in jail in Passaic, N.J. with three dozen other Muslims and held for three weeks without being told what for. A small price to pay, right? Hasnain Javed, a 20-year old Pakistani attending school at Queensborough College in New York was visiting his aunt in Houston. On the bus ride back, he was detained in Alabama by Border Patrol officers because he was carrying an expired visa.  In a county jail in Wiggins, Miss., he was beaten by inmates for 20 minutes while the guards pretended not to notice. When they stopped pretending not to notice, they watched while the cream of southern culture shouted racial epithets at the college student, called him Osama bin Laden and pummeled him without mercy. God bless America. Serves him right for being a foreigner, I guess. Dr. Al-Badr Al-Hazmi, a San Antonio radiologist was arrested on Sept. 12 for three suspicious coincidences: 1) for having the same last name as one of the Sept. 11 terrorists, a name as common in Saudi Arabia as Smith is in the United States 2) for having donated money to an organization that builds health clinics in Palestinian territories and 3) for having once had contact with one of Osama bin Laden's 50 siblings, an act our own president has committed since the bin Laden family is rich, prominent and huge and 4) he booked flights on Travelocity as did the terrorists and many thousands of Americans including me.  Al-Hazmi was held in custody for two weeks with only a mattress on the floor and a gown he was given to wear when his clothes and eye glasses were confiscated. He was denied medical treatment for his bronchitis which became worse in the cold cell, contact with his wife for 11 days and a blanket. He claims to have been routinely kicked by FBI agents, they deny this but not the rest. Additionally, 60 Israelis are being held nationwide, detained as "suspects of special interest to the government." Israel is an ally, right? Oh well, brown is brown. And these are just a few of the people we know about. Let's think about it pragmatically. Even if liberty is not important, finding terrorists is and we can't do that if we scare the hell out men who can tell us who they suspect the real terrorists might be.  I wouldn't risk a severe beating by hicks for this country and I was born here. So here we are as Americans, throwing the baby out with the bathwater and other cliches because it feels so good to be bigots. I think we are all better than this. I know America is.

      Today's column is dedicated to Courtney Brummer, a good friend of ours who isn't feeling very good right now.  Courtney is one of the best police beat reporters I have ever known in the entire length of my professional journalism career. Please send her your positive energy, prayers or cash (in care of Greg Jerrett at The Nonpareil) depending on your religious beliefs. You are the Esther Rolls to our "Good Times." We miss you, C.  Now, get better soon or the fish gets it. I'm serious. Johnson said he will give new meaning to the term "battered fish." And if you are not better and back at your desk Monday, the fish is going swimming in the Missouri and I am NOT driving him there, capisce?  And now, without further ado, here is "Courtney's Column" or "My sweet tattoo." So there I was sitting in Body Images Tattoo Parlor and Piercing Emporium trying to decide whether I wanted to "get some ink done" or have a small metal rod shoved through my foreskin.  Decisions, decisions. Long story short (no pun intended), my foreskin was stolen from me years ago by an unscrupulous barbarian of a doctor who convinced my mother circumcision was somehow more hygienic than au natural. This is in spite of the fact that Europeans are never circumcised unless they are also Jews and you don't hear about any great plagues being spread by unclean units. Down with circumcision! I decided to go with the ink, but it had to have meaning. No flaming skulls with swords sticking out of them for me. No sir. No flowers, butterflies or broken hearts either. I decided the only tattoo for me was four letters in perfect Roman or Trajan letters: "SPQR." "SPQR" stands for Senatus Populusque Romanum or Senate and People of Rome. The Romans were as big on acronyms as we are with our BKs, KFCs, VCRs, DVDs, MRIs, EKGs and NASAs. In addition to the fact that Latin is one of the hardest rocking dead languages you ever will see (thanks Scheib!), "SPQR" and the seal of the Roman Republic was prominently featured on my favorite T-shirt from high school.  That's right, I was in Latin Club. You want to make something of it? But I swore I would never get something permanently written on my skin unless I could justify it to my mother who worked SO HARD to make all this skin.  And here is my justification or at least my rationalization. Of all the civilizations that have come and gone on this crazy planet we call Earth, the Romans are arguably one of the greatest. They were not the most original people; they modeled themselves after the Greeks. They certainly were not the kindest of empires; they gave us crucifixion and gladiatorial combat. But they were great engineers, cooks, doctors, soldiers and scholars. They conquered most of the known world in their time. They owned ALL the beach front property around the Mediterranean and, most importantly, they brought peace to a chaotic world and got rich doing it. Without the Romans, western civilization as we know it would not exist today. Of course they enslaved millions, killed millions more and eventually defined corruption, cruelty and insanity. At its height, the Roman Republic before the Caesars was the pinnacle of enlightened democratic leadership and is the model we follow to this day. "SPQR" reminds me that sometimes the greatest of human accomplishments go hand-in-hand with the greatest atrocities.  It reminds me of the duality of man. That we are equally capable of good and evil. That each of us is as capable of greatness as infamy. And most importantly, this tattoo reminds me that ALL of this, our lives, our place in history, fame, luck, wealth, cruelty, art, pain ... everything, no matter how long it lasts, is temporary. And that is OK, too. Of course, my next tattoo will probably be Dilbert peeing on Osama bin Laden's head. And that is what I told Chuck at the tattoo parlor as he stabbed into my arm repeatedly with the razor sharp needle that injected me with carbon-rich black ink. When he was done, I was impressed with the skill he used to render my new body art in perfect Trajan letters. "Now, don't go swimming for at least a week and a half," he said. "But," I said, "I'm going to Hawaii tomorrow!" Next week: My Hawaiian vacation. What went wrong? What went right? Does turkey taste better in the tropics? How do you say pass the stuffing in Korean? Will I get that job at the Honolulu Star-Bulletin? Am I really proud to be Samoan or am I just happy to see you?  All these questions and more will be answered in the next episode of "Running Thoughts."  - Greg Jerrett is a Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      Note: This column can be sung in its entirety to the tune of "Pretty Boy Floyd" by Woody Guthrie. Won't you gather 'round me children, here's a story I will tell. About a day of eating... all the turkey you can hold... down. Ah, the holidays. Thanksgiving is my favorite. It is not nearly as commercial as Christmas, Halloween, Easter, St. Patrick's Day or even Arbor Day, which we all know is just an excuse for the Man to sell more trees! Am I right people? The word "holiday" literally means "holy day" and time was all holidays had a religious element and were not just about taking the day off. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I like my holy days to be pure, spiritual and, whenever possible, covered in gravy.  Nothing beats the purity, spirituality and gravy of Thanksgiving, of getting together with the family to do nothing more complicated than to have a meal that's every element drips with tradition, meaning and turkey fat.  There is a purpose behind everything on the table at Thanksgiving from the bird that was Ben Franklin's choice for national bird (not the eagle) to the New England cranberry sauce that sits upright jiggling on a saucer with the ridges from the can still embedded in its side.  Stuffing, what a great thing to do to stale bread. I like any food item with peasant origins and stuffing is one of the top ten greatest peasant foods ever invented as a way to save bread from the trash and every drop of flavor from the body cavity of fowl. Corn, that fat, rich, yellow plant that is so perfect in flavor and nutrition that it gets its own god in some polytheistic, animistic cultures. If any food deserves to be worshipped, it is corn. This is doubly true in Iowa, the world's number one corn producer. Our bountiful harvests not only feed us they feed the world. It is nice to celebrate your own plenty, but it can only be enhanced by celebrating the plenty you put on nearly every table of the world. That is a warm feeling that doesn't go away. It has been said before but it bears repeating year after year for that is what makes a tradition a tradition: Thanksgiving is a day to reflect on how lucky we truly are. We are lucky to have such copious bounty, to be able to eat that copious bounty with friends and family and to work out all our issues while ruining someone else's copious hard work. Nothing makes turkey and stuffing taste better than pointing the finger at someone. Except, of course, for gravy, which should also have its own deity.  It is a cleansing to get these things out at Thanksgiving because the more turkey you eat, the more tired you get and the less important all your issues become as you pass out on the couch from turkey coma. For the last three years, I have spent Thanksgiving either volunteering at churches I didn't belong to or sitting alone in a graduate dorm eating rotisserie chicken watching Clint Eastwood shoot people on TBS and giving thanks for the bounty of Wild Turkey and Pepsi in my 64-ounce Kwik Shop insulated mug. That isn't half bad either.  Nothing beats hour after hour of watching Clint Eastwood pretend to kill people unless it is the "Christmas Story" marathon on TNT. Ted Turner, how did we make it through the holidays without you? Excuse me, I promised myself I wouldn't cry, but I tend to get a little emotional around the holidays. OK, I'm back. Thanksgiving is the greatest holiday contributed to North American culture by Indians and the only unfortunate thing about it is that people think the Pilgrims (emphasis on the grim) could have come up with it. No, today's Thanksgiving is the descendant of the Native American harvest festival and made its way into the culture through the Pilgrims. That's why they don't have Thanksgiving in England. English folks had no need for gratitude until they found their bacon saved from the fires of starvations by the likes of Chief Massasoit of the Wampanoags and his buddy, Squanto, a man who liked a good party unlike your average Calvinist. So this Thursday, live it up, give thanks, appreciate those people near and dear to you, eat tremendous amounts of great food, play with the kids, watch some football, PLAY some football and, if all else fails, remember that  "Kelly's Heroes," "Two Mules for Sister Sara" and "Any Which Way You Can" will all be airing on Thanksgiving. -Greg Jerrett is Daily Nonpareil staff writer.

      So there I was in diabetes education class last Tuesday listening to the nurse talk about racial differences in the occurrence of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes across the United States when some whip cracker comments that the alarmingly high occurrence of diabetes among American Indians must be "from sitting around drinking all that 'firewater.'" And he laughed quietly to himself. Now the last couple of weeks have had their share of ups and downs. While I am largely becoming jazzed about my hideous new, life-altering ailment, I still find myself lamenting the loss of some of my best friends: Large pizzas on late nights, cheeseburgers in the car, mountainous gyros covered in tzatziki sauce, quarts of juice, bowls of California dip and wave after wave of rippled chips. Is that "Amazing Grace" I hear? It is my rapidly changing personality that is coming as the greatest surprise. To paraphrase Rob Zombie, I am becoming more Greg than Greg. Par example (French meaning "for example"), I had actually never planned to write anywhere in this column at anytime that I am part Indian (or French Canadian for that matter). Even in this day and age you run into people for whom race is a deal-breaker. It's a hassle. Some people are just curious, and I don't feel like answering questions about it. Some are casually put off and might not even realize it while others are vile racists who immediately will act out. I had a friend in high school whose mother discovered my "secret" one night while telling an Indian joke. He told her, not me. Even though she had loved me for years, after that she couldn't resist rude commentary.  My favorite was in reference to my guitar: "Isn't that a COWBOY instrument?" Uh, no it isn't, you hateful witch. My buddy was a mama's boy any way, and let's just say the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree. I always have tolerated cracks people make because I don't have time or interest in explaining why I am not super dark or why I am not wearing a deerskin loincloth. Many comments are innocuous and fairly harmless and I am not hypersensitive about it.  I also have let things go because ignorant people are not worth the argument. A month ago, I probably would have let this "firewater" remark slide, but as I sat in this room of about 18 people where I almost brought my mother and where my nephew might have to sit one day listening to this guy who definitely didn't win the West make his off-hand remarks, some switch in my head flipped and my sugar-rich blood boiled. I don't know if it was some crazy blood sugar thing or maybe it was just the accumulated effect of a lifetime of small indignities that broke this camel's back.  SNAP. I could give you a blow by blow of our mano a mano, but suffice it to say I went off on the guy and it felt awesome. Well... OK, here it is. "Yada, yada, yada... 'firewater!'"  "Hey man, I'm Indian and I don't want to hear that $@#%, do you understand me?" "Yeah," he said, barely containing a smirk because he still thought what he said was pretty funny. This served only to make me nearly black out and become legally "not responsible" for my actions. "I said, 'do you understand me?'" "I said, 'yes,'" he said, losing his demeanor of gaiety. "I heard you," I said all Shaft and stuff. "I just wasn't convinced." Was it worth it? Who knows. What are you gonna do? What can you say that hasn't been said before?  There is something instinctive and biological about race prejudice that I do not deny.  Carl Jung (1875-1961), the distinguished Swiss psychologist whose treatises on human consciousness have helped interpret human behavior, developed the theory of "the Other." Put simply because I don't fully comprehend it myself, we see the world in terms of concentric circles like a dartboard. Our Self is in the center of the bullseye - the opposite of the Other. In the nearest circle are things you might identify closely with like your family, Ford Mustangs and apple pie.  The next circles would be your town, state, country, things of your country but not of your region. We identify less and less with each circle the farther it gets away from us. On the outer rings are foreigners, people of other races, nationality, religion and concepts that are increasingly alien like putting mayonnaise on French fries, taking public transportation and tipping. So to some extent, fear of the Other is normal and natural. But diseases, mosquitoes and bears are natural, too, and we don't give in to them. Succumbing to racist instinct is just as demeaning to you as it is to the people you might mock and revile. Some people will make a virtue out of not being "politically correct" as though ranting about Jews, blacks, Mexicans or Iowans at will makes them somehow philosophically superior. There is a difference between politically incorrect honesty, saying what you believe without regard to how popular it will be, and insulting people with epithets and stereotypes. The first is a virtue, the second shows how xenophobic and hateful you are. On the cusp of the 21st century, we can do better and I believe we will.

      Some particularly immature people will question the existence of God simply because "bad things" happen. They posit that if God exists and is all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good, he could not possibly allow "bad things" to happen especially to "good people."  "Bad things" aplenty do indeed happen, therefore, God must not exist. QED. Done and done. I could not agree less with this line of reasoning and have always believed that the gargantuan list of "bad things" that have been happening to people since the dawn of time are the best proof we have that there must be a God.  "Bad things" are just God's way of saying, "I saw what you did, I know what you are thinking, I am always watching you and I am going to kill you whenever I want." If you do a few mental gymnastics, this is could actually be kind of comforting. I am the Mary Lou Retton of mental gymnastics and I am now prepared to flip and tumble for your amusement. Thursday, I was sitting in a doctor's office finding out I got the diabetes. It took about five minutes of real time. I suppose it should come as no surprise, but now, denial is not an option. It figures that about the time I started getting my life in order, my career underway, started buying grownup clothes and luxury items like fruit that I would get diabetes. I thought of about 20 different ways to approach this subject today from a classic bile-filled diatribe raging against the injustice of it all to a positive, uplifting message of courage in the face of adversity. I do plenty of the first and the second one is just not my style - Jesus, don't want me for a sunbeam. Of course, I considered not ever mentioning it to anyone ever. It is my business and I don't need another label. But if I am about nothing else, I am about a kind of brutal, often ill-conceived, honesty you find in children, the mentally challenged or college democrats.  The hardest part about getting a diagnoses like this is it changes your perception of who you are. I am not the person I was yesterday at noon. Am I supposed to accept that lightly?  I imagine it is not unlike the way women feel when they find out they are pregnant except that's a positive thing. What bothers me most is diabetes makes me evolution's punk. I don't like getting a real good sense of my own mortality.  This diabetes pronouncement feels like the cold hand of death shooting me an e-mail to let me know he's OK and will eventually be coming to Council Bluffs to pay me a visit and play the loosest slots in the Midwest... the bastard. Still it isn't all bad. I should have seen it coming and the solution, in addition to a few pills, is diet and exercise, something I should have been doing any way.  And maybe this WILL be an opportunity. After one pill I felt better than I have in weeks. I slept all night Thursday without getting up every hour to go to the bathroom and in spite of my low level anxiety, I am convinced that things can only get better. Still I hate labels. So I close paraphrasing one of the coolest lines from "Angels in America," Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning play, "I am not a diabetic, I am just a regular guy who can't eat sugar!" -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      November is National Diabetes Awareness Month. Which is pretty funny when you think about it. I get diagnosed with diabetes a few days before November gets rolling and it feels like I haven't written about anything else since. That's OK. In my experience, it isn't what you write about, but how you write about it. I could go on in some great detail for weeks about things I find in my belly button and as long as people are reasonably entertained, they will not complain. Now, I don't know if you believe in God or fate or karma, and I suppose it doesn't really matter in the end. But it does seem at times that pretty heavy coincidence plays its part in our lives and I am feeling that unbearable lightness of being this week. There is a certain euphoria that accompanies acceptance of the inevitable. This is called fatalism and in spite of its dire sounding name, it really isn't all that bad of a philosophy. Inuits, the people erroneously known as Eskimos, are fatalists. They are also some of the funniest people you will ever meet. Take my word for it. If you ever meet an Eskimo at a party, stay put because you will hear some of the funniest stories ever. When you live in the tundra and every day is a fight for survival against polar bears and narwhals, you have to have a healthy sense of humor. Let's face it, comedy is tragedy turned inside out. When you are standing on the edge of an ice flow with your grandpa minding his own business, enjoying a sunny, brisk arctic day and grandpa is swallowed whole from behind by a killer whale, it's kind of funny. Yes, boohoo, grandpa is dead, but the look of surprise on his face, that was priceless. As ironic as it sounds, fatalism is ultimately healthy. It isn't a morbid obsession with death, it is an acknowledgement that death is inevitable; you can't do anything about it so you might as well live it up while you can.  How liberating. I don't intend to write about "the old diabetes" every week, but for know I am reveling in certain personal revelations with an almost religious zeal. I don't know if it's the drugs talking or maybe my crazy blood sugar levels are winding me up, but it is as though my eyes are wide open.  I am having what alcoholics refer to as a "moment of clarity," that sweetest of moments when you step outside yourself and feel like a meaningful yet minuscule part of something bigger and greater.  God's plan, the universe, nature, time. It's like standing outside at night in the country on a clear summer night looking up at the Milky Way and for a brief moment you are the observer and the participant, unaware of your body, just conscious observation. You start to roll it around in your mind that there is really nothing standing between you on the surface of the earth and Alpha Centauri except four light years.  If you suspend credulity long enough, you feel like you could almost touch it. Right now, there are galaxies colliding, black holes sucking in matter, suns going pop, massive explosions are happening in slow motion in a universe of nearly infinite proportions. Though we are blissfully unaware of it, there are solar systems forming in corners of the universe we can't see, planets being born and life evolving on a scale so massive you need advanced degrees in theology, astrophysics and quantum mechanics to just begin to comprehend.  In light of all this glorious creation and awesome destruction, does it really matter if I have to take a couple of pills? How much time we have is not as important as what we do with it. If facing mortality is the price I have to pay for living each day consciously and deliberately, that is a small price to pay. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      While covering the 60th reunion of Abraham Lincoln High School's class of '41 last week, I met a man celebrating with his classmates who told me he was still holding a grudge after 60 years. An underclassman counterpranked him months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor by erasing a "Class of '41" sign he and his buddies had painted in the street in the dead of night. This "kid," who must be nearly 80 by now, waited in the weeds until they were done and, using gasoline, undid their hard work. Wow, I thought, that is a long time to hold a grudge. Now, I hold grudges like nobody I know, but I'm working on it. And I figure as long as you don't let your life be controlled by hate, you aren't doing too bad. But this whole thing got me to thinking about the persistence of memory - what you remember and what you forget. My 10-year reunion was in '96. I was not planning to go because I kept in touch with most of the people I really liked, but a lawyer friend of mine could not wait to go. He planned on wearing his finest suit just to tell everyone who could not remember him that he was now an attorney. His closure apparently would not be complete if I was not there to witness it so, long story short, I ended up going. That night, I met in the parking lot of the Manawa Country Club with my good friend Jim Beam. We had a short conversation about courage. "Glug, glug, glug," I said to Jim. "Glug, glug, indeed," said Jim to me. Then we went in sharing a warm social glow ready to mingle and be happy. And I have to say that in spite of my earlier reluctance, I had a great time. I saw people I had not seen in 10 years - people I genuinely liked like Laurel and Cheryl Martin. They were, and still are, twins. I vaguely remember going to a movie with one of them once kind of like it was a date but not really. To this day, I cannot remember which one I went with because I liked both of them at different times in high school for entirely different reasons. Women are shocked by this admission. Most men are amused. Michelle Aiko Ross was just as cute and quiet as she was 10 years ago and duly impressed that I remembered her middle name. My good friend Dave, whom I'd known since I was 6, came out - literally and figuratively - and was visibly relieved to know I was not about to recoil in horror. A guy named Steve did not come out, and that was almost as surprising as anything that happened that night. The girls who thought the world revolved around them stood in the center of the room for us to snipe about while the guys who drank a lot in high school drank a lot. The music was a little TOO 1980s K-Tel's greatest hits, but occasionally the disc jockey hit the mark and we all felt like we did when we were 18. I don't know if it was the bourbon talking or not, but I had fun. Then something strange happened. This guy, let's call him Lenny Feebletwerp, comes up to me and springs his own "closure rap" on me like he had been waiting 10 years to catch me in his web. Lenny had been one of my best friends from the time we were 12 right through high school. He was a little fella with an artistic bent and no visible means of self-defense. We used to play D&D, read comics and listen to U2 back when nobody knew who they were. I gave this guy rides to and from school daily and kept him from getting beat down just by grace of being his friend. The problem with Lenny was he was hyperactive, and a caffeine high would make him intolerable. We called him Spaz at such moments and took to not inviting him places. When he "spazzed," I became his favorite target. He would pick and poke at me like a chicken hawk - drove me nuts.  I grew weary of this behavior once while sitting on a two-story deck.  I gave Lenny fair warning. "If you do not settle down, stop touching me and stop picking at me, I am going to hang you off this deck," I said.  Lenny did not believe me. A big mistake. Lenny gave me a wet willie to show me who was boss, and I grabbed him by the ankles and hung him over that deck some 15 feet. Suddenly joviality was the last thing on Lenny's mind. "Let me up, you [expletive deleted]," Lenny shrieked. "I'm an [expletive deleted]?" You're an [expletive deleted]," I countered. "Now settle down, you spaz, and I'll let you back up." The whole thing lasted maybe 10 seconds, and Lenny deserved every moment of it for being such an [expletive deleted] and I felt quite comfortable with my actions. It was, after all, self-defense and, as far as guys go, pretty harmless. I guess Lenny had years to stew over this, because at our reunion he comes up to me and I don't know if he had a pre-reunion meeting with Jim Beam or not, but he pulls this completely unexpected movie cliche out of nowhere. "You remember that time you hung me off of that deck? I never forgot about that." Needless to say, I was flabbergasted that Lenny did not have my appreciation for that incident. I guess it would be like expecting the Japanese to appreciate the bombing of Hiroshima with the same perspective as Americans. My only regret was that the country club we had our reunion at had no balconies. It helps to remember that the best revenge - besides hanging a jerk off a deck - is just to let things slide. Very few people care as much about your demons as you do, and "getting closure" just tips most people off that you have been simmering in your own juices for years. Let it go and get on with your life. See you in 2006, Lenny, until then, try to think good thoughts. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      With the threat of further terrorist attacks on the American homeland looming and considering I had not left C.B. since I got here for anything longer than it takes to see "Memento," I decided to roadtrip it last weekend.  I was long overdue to visit friends in the Quad Cities so what better time to hit the highway. I drive a sweet 1986, powder blue Chevy Caprice Classic. I know, I know. Impressive. It is a slow cruiser, the kind of wheels a man can do some big pimpin' in up and down broadway going 35 or 40 m.p.h.  Sure the ladies like it and I look cool behind the wheel, but my hoopte has way more than 100,000 miles on her. Constant cruising speeds of 65 to 85 m.p.h. make her use more oil than the road cast of "Grease" so I decided to rent.  When it comes to driving 10 hours at night at high speeds, I like the kind of security I get from a brand new rental car. The last thing I need while driving long distances on a short vacation is to end up on the side of the road waiting for some towtruck driver from Keokuk to decide how much he can overcharge me for the honor of hauling me back to his service station to then charge me $100 for a $10 part. No, for me renting a 2002 LeSabre is as much a part of the mini-vacation as the destination. No car worries, air-conditioned comfort, a tape player, a 2-litre of Mountain Dew and some shades... what more could a modern nomad ask for besides a bladder that can go more than an hour between stops? I went to visit Pete and Denise Church of Davenport. Pete is formerly of Council Bluffs, my old college roommate and my attorney should I ever get into legal trouble while I am actually IN the Quad Cities.  What a town. I had been there a couple of times prior, but I had never been there with my own wheels able to cruise the lanes peering into every corner.  The Q.C. is four towns Davenport, Bettendorf, Rock Island and Moline, the first two in Iowa, the last two in Illinois. But the really cool thing about the Quad Cities is the people there do not spend much time caring about which side is Iowa and which side is Illinois.  All four have something to offer the whole and rather than nitpick, people just appreciate the whole thing. I went to The District in Rock Island for a microbrew and Biagge's in Davenport for Italian cuisine that is the finest this side of New York. I hit a Hardee's in Bettendorf and cruised the airport in Moline. At no time in the Quad Cities will you hear anyone from one of these towns slag off the others. The local affiliates are on both sides of the river and talk about soldiers from Iowa and Illinois or Quad Cities residents without rancor or division. That is pretty cool and quite a contrast to what we have here in the Omaha/Council Bluffs metropolitan area. I think it's the name. That little slash between Omaha and Council Bluffs is just a symbol of division. What this area needs is name like "The Quad Cities" or "The Twin Cities" or "Siouxland." We need a name that says, "We are all in this together" and "This is one big happy metro area and I would no sooner insult my neighbor than myself." I propose something hip and forward thinking as well. This is the 21st Century after all and if this name is to stick, it must have an enduring classy quality to it . How about "The River Cities," we could shorten it to R.C. "Where you going, Ethel?" "I'm going up to the R.C. to do a little gambling, maybe see a show, and you?" "Why I enjoy going to the River Cities for its rich pioneer history, great shopping and go-go clubs." If you're like me (and I know I am), the R.C. would be a cool place to hang out where people on both sides of the river are cool and just like being apart of a community that spans two states and has lots to offer in the way of microbreweries, gambling, dog racing, international cuisine and reasonably priced hotels. In the summer, we could have "River Cities" days and invite folks from the area to come and celebrate our specialness and new R.C. identity with a carnival and special musical guests like Boz Skaggs, Kansas and Journey. And by calling ourselves the River Cities, we don't leave out Carter Lake, Bellevue, Papillion, La Vista, Ralston or any of the fringe communities we might annex later on. Many would seek to enter into our new and unique pack mentality.  So hop on board R.C. people. It's time for a new identity for a new millennium. God bless America and the R.C.! -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. He may be contacted at 328-1811 ext. 279 or by e-mail at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      A couple of weeks ago I was asked to speak at a local journalism conference to high school students interested in opinion writing. I thought, "what the hey, sounds like a hoot." I dig rapping with the young folks and getting "jiggy wit it" as they say. Most of my friends are in their early 20s. I even have one college friend from my recent grad school experience who just turned 18 because she was a prodigy when she started college.  My old friends are chronically unhip, stuck in the 80s types so my notions of who my contemporaries are is completely out of whack.  I keep up with new trends, new music, what is cool, what is funky and I still like to consider myself young and hip enough to hang with just about anybody even though I have to sit down a lot while doing it and the mosh pit is right out. But something disturbing happened while I was at this conference, something that made me question my like and my priorities. The sessions went OK, I answered most questions to the satisfaction of these high school juniors and seniors but then one kid asked me a question that threw me for a loop: "Mr. Jerrett, can I go to the bathroom?" There were at least two things wrong with this question that I could think of. First of which was when this guy said "Mr. Jerrett," I actually looked at the door to see why my father had followed me to T.J.  Nobody, I mean nobody calls me Mr. Jerrett unless they are a telemarketer or a letter writer following a form of psuedo-politeness i.e. "Mr. Jerrett is completely wrong" or "Mr. Jerrett is an ignorant jackass who should go back where he come from." I'm not a "Mr." I'm G-Dawg, G-Money, G-Monet (accent on the second syllable). People call me "dude" or "buddy." If teenagers start calling me "Mr." I might feel compelled to clean up my credit record, buy a car made this century or start investing in my retirement fund. I'm not ready to be a "Mr." I'm a 33-year-old manchild like so many others of my wicked Generation X who decided to stay young far beyond what would normally be considered wise if for no other reason than the job market kept us from seeking truly grown up employment when we graduated from college the first time.  Society was not prepared to offer us the grownup jobs at 22 so many of us waited and took "entry level" positions in food service, record stores and telesales. We decided to not grow up either and good for it. Had I decided to grow up at 22 or 24 or 26, I would be a very bitter adult working at a very low paying job in telemarketing reading from a boring script instead of writing scripts and articles and columns now. Samuel Clemens, better known as the great Mark Twain, advocated against growing up for as long as possible... at least on the inside. Of course in his day, a man could just decide to become a steamboat operator at 16 or pan for gold in California and then go into journalism by 20. No degrees necessary just rugged individualism and wide open job market.   Considering Twain's various lines of work, love of drink, cigars, parties and his casual lifestyle, he lived his life young at heart until the end. What a guy.  The other thing disturbed me that fateful day was why would anybody ask me if they could go to the bathroom? That just freaked me out. I don't need to know if a guy needs to take a lead or not.  I should not be allowed that power over anyone. No one should be able to tell a man when he can and cannot go to the bathroom. This is America after all.  Come to think of it, I am not altogether sure if that kid ever came back to the classroom, either. For all I know, he set out for Alaska to seek his fortune as a salmon fisher It's funny that at 33 I still do not feel like an adult. It seems like my parents were irretrievably adult by the time they were in their mid-20s. Of course they had kids, a house and responsibility to take the edge off of any childish notions they may have had. I used to think it was just me, but lately I've seen similar sentiments expressed by other 30-year-olds, mostly comedians and night club DJs. We are a generation of children coming into our own a little late in life and I don't really mind.  I think waiting until my 30s for my adult life to get started was a good thing in many ways. I didn't have the chops in my 20s to be a writer. I didn't have the life experience or the education. I hadn't done the essential reading or done enough writing. I probably would have become disillusioned and quit before I got rolling. Or maybe that's just what I tell myself because deep down inside I know I could have been editor in chief of the weekly Keokuk Times-Picayune by 25 with a Lexus the size of a yacht and yacht the size of a house by now if only I had applied myself. Oh well, best not to think of these things. The Lord works in mysterious ways and has a wonderful plan for our lives that He is not inclined to share with us. Now THAT'S funny. -Greg Jerrett is staff writer at the Nonpareil. He may be contacted at 328-1811 ext. 279 or by e-mail at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      Since last week, I have not been able to shake the dread feeling that America had been horribly changed forever. Sleepless nights are bad times to be thinking about how America will recover from this brutal assault. Normally, I would catch a little late night comedy to help readjust my compass but just like us, the hosts of late night television needed some time off to collect themselves. And it occurred to me that like so many other Americans, I really do get a great deal of my information about the days events from unorthodox sources like Comedy Central's "The Daily Show." Why not? It is at least as informative as FoxNews. Don't misunderstand. I get my facts from the hard news boys and Andrea Thompson of CNN Headline News, formerly of "NYPD Blue," formerly of "Babylon 5." Did anyone else notice that Thompson started off cocky, but these days she looks like she wished she never left the acting business? What I had been missing over the last couple of weeks was perspective. Not the kind of political explanation of current events you get on PBS, but the kind of perspective only comedy can give a situation. For the last couple of weeks, I forgot how important laughter is, not just for me, but for all of us. It has felt trivial and shameful to laugh since Sept. 11 and that is a shame. The worst thing we can do is trivialize our need to laugh. It keeps us sane. Granted their was not much joy in America and their still isn't. But that is about to change. Tragedy is a part of the American landscape and no one knows that better than a good comedian. Great comedy comes from pain. Anyone truly funny can tell you that. It is not something that can be explained well, I am afraid, but suffice it to say there is a moment in all great comedy where the worst is confronted and overcome. The silent film stars knew this. Slapstick is all about human strength in the face of weakness, inevitability and evil. I saw three men I admire (and Jay Leno) get back to the business of making us laugh this week. David Letterman, Conan O'Brien and Jon Stewart came out to do their "little shows" and each one stood in front of their audience and shared what Woodie Guthrie called their "nakedest self" with the folks at home and in the audience. None of them was sure if what they were doing was right. They were feeling their way along like the rest of us, and God bless them for trying. I was particularly impressed with Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" Thursday. For the uninitiated, "The Daily Show" is a satirical news show on Comedy Central. It's popular with the college kids, but grown-ups like it, too. I was shaken from my reverie when Stewart said, "I mourn, but I do not despair because we've already won." This little comedian from a second-rate cable show went on to describe how the forces of chaos will never beat us because it is too unsatisfying to destroy. "Chaos cannot maintain itself." We are builders and always have been. We do not live in prosperity because we are lazy or wicked, and if Jerry Falwell thinks that Sept. 11 happened because we were asking for it, he has more in common with the men who blew up the World Trade Center than the rest of America. We are prosperous because we are industrious. Before the day was done Sept. 11, rescue workers were picking through the rubble by hand. Now that is tough. We had a setback, but in the final analysis, we didn't lose anything, not a damn thing. Terrorists knocked down one block of this country and as soon as they did, we didn't cower. We didn't run and hide. We got out there and started digging and we haven't stopped yet and we won't stop digging and rebuilding and growing ever because no matter what else is true about America, we progress and we prevail. Attacks like this don't weaken us, they just make us stronger, like fire on the prairie. Everybody where I'm from knows the toughest guy around isn't the one who can beat the hell out of the most people, he's the one who can take a punch like it never even phased him. Those are the guys I have always respected and that is what America is. We can take a hit and keep on keeping on. We aren't just the toughest because we beat the hell out of the Japanese militarists and the Nazis. We're tough because we took what they dished out and kept rolling. We're tough because we survived the depravity of the Great Depression, the brutality of the Civil War, the horrors of World War I, the existentialist nightmares of Korea, Vietnam and the Cold War and the witch hunts of the McCarthy era. America didn't lose it's innocence last week. That is self-deluded bunk. We lost it in 1776 when we told the British Empire to lump it and then beat them back with squirrel guns. And we did it again in 1812 when they came back for round two, burned down the White House and found out the hard way what a "trench" was. America will survive as it always has, through sheer force of will - not because we are righteous, not because we are the chosen people of the Lord, not because we are better than everybody else, but because when all is said and done, we can take a hit. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      I have known since last Tuesday that I would be writing about the tragedy that occurred in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Yet I am still at a loss for words. Thank God for clichÃ©s, they come in handy at times like this.  No amount of preparation can make you ready for the moment you have to put pen to paper or sit down at the keyboard and commit to whatever it is you have to say about a tragic event that makes everything seem trivial. We have seen more images of death and destruction on the news in five days than in an entire summer of over-the-top action films and that is hard to believe possible. I commiserate with my fellow Americans and feel their pain as I watch them walk around Manhattan with photos waiting for a chance to get on camera. I am proud of the efforts of volunteers, police, firefighters and all rescue workers. They are the best of all of us and I salute them. We have all seen so many horrific images this week, many live and uncut, others repeated in endless montages. One image I cannot shake is of a man standing in the window of one of the World Trade Center Towers caught between fire behind him and a 100-story drop in front of him - the fear of immolation battling the fear of heights. The Nonpareil offices are right under the flight path to Eppley. We have always been able to hear jets approaching, but much to our surprise yesterday we found ourselves unnerved by the descending sound of jets, a sound Council Bluffs residents have heard daily throughout their lives and come to miss when away. Now it just sounds like anticipation, fear and death. I am angry that these primitive, evil bastards have attacked our country placing their corrupt ideology above the thousands of lives they took. No ideology is above human life.  I feel the primal need for revenge, but I know that violence just creates more violence. Not one innocent person should be killed while we seek vengeance or the clarity of our moral purpose will evaporate. Above all else, we need to continue to be as righteous as possible. No good will come of killing those who are not guilty. The problem with terrorism is there is no enemy to fight, no army waiting over the horizon for us to decimate, no country to declare war on. This will not be a war in any conventional sense, but a vendetta to counter the jihad. We must be very careful to remain civilized. Analogies to Pearl Harbor have been common so here is another. At the end of World War II, the Nuremberg trials set a new standard for meting out justice for war crimes. We cannot and should not turn our backs on that standard now no matter how much satisfaction it would give us to carpet bomb the next country that looks at us funny. We should all be disgusted by the retaliation against Arab-Americans and Muslims that have been reported on CNN, MSNBC and other news outlets Nauseating stories of cabbies pulled from their cars and beaten for just looking like Arabs. Most Americans cannot tell an Arab from an Indian from a Samoan and should not even think of acting out based on what they see. Arab-Americans and Muslims in this country are as much victims of this tragedy as anyone and they should not have to bear the brunt of bigotry in addition to their own grief. They are no more responsible for what has happened than the average white Christian was for the Oklahoma City bombing. Yet I find myself challenged to keep irrational prejudice in check because my emotions are overriding my intellect and sense of justice.  We fear for the future because we have no idea what is to come in the days ahead. We are shaken, but as convinced as ever that we will prevail. As Americans, we can and will. We have been there for the world and now the world is here for us. Let us not forget that out of all of this tragedy, the best of all humanity represented itself splendidly so that we might forge ahead united against evil in the century to come. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      You might not know it to look at me, but I am something of a geek. No, really, it's true!  I take no offense at the term "geek." I am quite proud of it most of the time as are many geeks these days whose nerd status has earned them kudos in fields as varied as creative writing, computer programming and synchronized swimming. "Revenge of the Nerds" really turned things around for my people.  My particular form of geekiness manifested itself at a young age in the form of an undying love for the creative expression inherent in science fiction. I loved science fiction movies like "The Planet of the Apes," "Soylent Green," "Logan's Run"; novels like "Dune," "Foundation" and "Childhood's End"; and television shows like "Space 1999," "Doctor Who" and "The Prisoner." I had my serious comic book collecting phase and my Dungeons and Dragons role playing game period and even a good run at going to conventions in high school.  I still like to duck into a good game store once in a while just to get the old panky stanky sci fi-style, hang out with some hardcore geeks, leaf through a GURPS supplement, maybe pick up a Judge Dredd graphic novel, the latest edition of Heavy Metal or a used "X-Files" video tape. But there is one singular avatar of science fiction that has stood out above and beyond all the others for me and a lot of geeks. That ultimate variation of the continuing basic entity of science fiction, the brainchild of one Mr. Gene Roddenberry: "Star Trek." Now I am not the most diehard Trekker that ever lived. I don't compete for the honor of knowing more about every episode than other geeks. I don't know the combination to the safe in Kirk's quarters. I don't speak any Klingon. And I don't have any blueprints of the Enterprise tucked away.  But I can name most of the episodes. I do notice when Kirk says "Fire photon torpedoes" and they fire phasers instead and by tomorrow I should have all 80 odd hours of the original episodes recorded.  Why bother? Today is the 35th anniversary of the first airing of "Star Trek," - Trekker's Christmas as it is known in some circles and you can hear the fans shout "It's 9/8 y'all, I got nothing but this earth thing called 'love'" as they watch "The Wrath of Khan," pop the top off a 40 quart and pour one on the ground for their homies who couldn't be there. Sept. 8, 1966, was when it all began in earnest, but whether you prefer Kirk or Picard, "The Next Generation" or the original show, what is essentially true and good about "Star Trek" is what is true and good about any great literature, art form or human endeavor: Ethos.  Say what you will, "Star Trek" is full of ethos, that distinguishing character, sentiment, morality that guides people in their beliefs as individuals, groups. In this case, Gene Roddenberry created a universe with an ethical backdrop by which the entire human race could not only abide but thrive. This future universe is not just full of action, aliens, firefights, fistfights, knifefights and hot, alien love. It is a place guided by enlightened thought where it is the responsibility of each man, woman and Andorian to live up to their human potential. It is a world in which the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  It is a place where diversity is truly our strength, racism is outdated and the infinite possibilities of the universe charge people up more than money. Art thrives, science is about the pursuit of knowledge and the human adventure is just beginning. Not all of what "Trek" offered was in terms of fantasy, not by any means. Before "Star Trek" took to the airwaves, it was not considered kosher to talk about race on TV, let alone criticize racists for their attitudes.  Kirk and crew not only did it, they did it with style in an episode called "Let that be your last battlefield." It is an episode with a seemingly ridiculous premise. A race of people called the Cheronians are half black and half white. Part of the race race is black on the left side and is viewed as inferior by the part of the race that is black on the right side. It is obvious to them who is superior but not to the crew of the Enterprise.  The Cheronians destroy themselves tragically because they cannot give up their petty race hatred. The message was sent loud and clear in a time when men and women were being beaten mercilessly for sitting at lunch counters because they were black. "Star Trek" had the first interracial kiss and not just the ones between Captain Kirk and some blue chick from Orion either, a meaningful kiss between a white man and a black woman, a taboo in the late 1960s. For 35 years, in soon-to-be-five TV incarnations and nine movies, "Star Trek" has offered us a fictional measuring stick by which to judge our human potential. Why is this important? Because there is no REAL measuring stick available. There are no human societies that have lived up to their potential, we are all pretty much the same, living day by day. But once in a while someone comes along like Mozart, Stephen Hawkings, Michael Jordan or Gene Roddenberry to show the rest of us what is possible. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      With Labor Day upon us in the United States and Canada, I thought this might be a good opportunity to talk about work a little bit. You know, give a proper shout out to the men and women who work hard and get things done around here. So in the spirit of Bruce Springsteen, Woody Guthrie, Caesar Chavez, Upton Sinclair, Norma Rae, the people in the fields, coal mines and factories, thanks for all the hard work, take a day off, you've earned it and please, for the love of God, don't overthrow us! Anybody who has put in a full day breaking their back knows work can be a grind. I've done enough time walking beans, bailing hay, milking cows and hauling concrete around to know that I am glad I don't have to do it every day. It's too hard and I'm not used to that kind of labor. So I respect people who labor and are good at it. My biggest complaint right now is the pop machine closest to my desk has Diet Mountain Dew but no regular Dew. What's up with that? But there is one thing we all have no matter how good or bad our jobs are and that is the right as Americans to complain - long, loud and proud - about whatever work we do. So this Labor Day, while you're taking it easy or hanging out with friends and family, take part in that great American working tradition and tell those work stories. You know the ones about bizarre customers or that boss that who ran the work site like Joseph Stalin. I will get things rolling with a work story of my own. I already gave you the "Diet Dew" story, so here is one from the dark, distant past. It was 1997 and I was working as an operator for the Psychic Hotline - not actually practicing fortune telling, you understand, just passing along the 900 number and explaining how the free minutes worked to the marks, I mean, clients. It was night work from 10 to 6 in the morning when all the infomercials ran and the primary client base - sad, lonely insomniacs - was up. Every night, the soma-driven epsilons who made up the staff would take hundreds of calls. We were eventually replaced by a recording - how insulting... or appropriate depending on how you look at it. While it lasted, the money was good and we got to read while working. For a college job, it was pretty cool. But like most irrelevant things, it made me think about the nature of humanity, especially that subsection known as "Americans."  You see, for every sad sucker who called genuinely interested in talking to a "real, live psychic," there were 20 drunks, speed freaks, perverts, naughty 12-year-olds or conspiracy theorists who thought that screaming "you suck! you suck! you suck!" at the top of their lungs into a phone in the dead of night made them the funniest thing since George Carlin. I felt almost as sorry for them as I did myself.  The real trick was that most of the people who called only heard what they wanted so I never had to fool anybody. You could tell them 10 times they only got five minutes free and they would still stay on the phone for 45 minutes. Then they would call back and ask if they were going to be charged. Yeah, you will. Click. Our call volume was high and it got boring saying the same thing every 45 seconds for eight hours. Our supervisors either did not care what we did or were control addicts who made us ask to go to the bathroom. That I cannot tolerate.  The only break we could hope for would be the occasional prank. We REALLY looked forward to getting them and sharing them with our co-workers.  The thing I hated most was how this job made me lose faith in my fellow citizens. Occasionally, a call would come in from Canada, I could tell by the phone number on the caller I.D. I never got a bad prank call from a Canadian. Those people are wicked funny. A good sense of humor is a hallmark of intelligence. Oftentimes, the pranks were masterful in their artistry. One young Canuck had a standup routine he was apparently working on. I have never laughed so hard in my life. It made me want to head for the Great White North at 90 per. In fact, I made a few calls about becoming a Canadian, it seemed like a good idea at the time. I called Mike Ward at the Canadian Consulate in Chicago who was, not to perpetuate a stereotype, most helpful and friendly. His primary area of expertise was politics and trade so he couldn't give me the goods on citizenship. He passed me to Tony Brown who had been working in Canadian immigration for 25, fun-soaked years. Becoming a Canadian is not as hard as you might think. Canada is not desperate for newbies, but they do take just about anybody who wants to work. To get permission to work in Canada, all you need is a job. Take a vacation, check the papers, go to an interview, get hired and apply for a work permit. It's just that simple. I might just stick around for a while and see how things work out in the U.S. before heading north.  Have a great labor day! -Greg Jerrett is a Daily staff writer.

      "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein "Dreamer. You know you are a dreamer. But can you put your head in your hands? Oh no!" -Supertramp  Albert Einstein did some of his early work on atomic energy at Iowa State. It's true and ISU has the pictures to prove it. I used to walk right past a memorial to some of the early uranium purification tests and think to myself, "My god, I wonder how much radiation this big rock with the plaque on it is cranking out?" Not too many people know this, but the Big E, as he was called by the members of Alpha Sigma Phi when he invented the beer bong in their spanking room, was a whimsical, philosophical, creative dude.  Unfortunately, his kind are no longer welcomed at universities these days unless their whimsy can rake in the dough. With that in mind, I thought I would continue an ongoing series I know folks around here get a kick out of and I don't mind talking about either, which is to say giving more reasons why many people should not go to college.  Previously I said that public universities are more technical schools than places of higher learning today especially the ones that are starved for cash.  As recently as last year at Iowa State, many professors in the arts and sciences felt not only short shrifted by the university, they felt the university was giving a raw deal to undergraduate education in favor of research. This has been an ongoing concern since the 1980s. The theory is that research brings in money whereas educating undergraduates takes time away from research that brings in money.  Professors in the "soft" sciences and the beneficial but unquantifiable areas of communication, literature, philosophy and performing arts (a.k.a. liberal arts and sciences) complained vigorously and even attempted to draw attention to their plight by starting a faculty petition. Many LAS faculty members complained about the difficulty of working in an environment of fear and repression. Takes quite a bit for middle-class profs to admit they work in the same kind of atmosphere as the average meatpacker (see current issue of Mother Jones, now available online at motherjones.com and at speciality bookstores). Money, as people with money are always eager to tell you, makes the world go around. So logically if you are not "all about" making money or not at least slavishly inclined to defer superiority to those with it or those who are killing themselves to become those with it, you are often dismissed as naive or "a dreamer." Why? Because it is cheaper than locking you up. This is standard in "the real world," but college is not "the real world," it is supposed to be better than that. It is supposed to be a place for ideas, the kind of ideas that ultimately enrich the lives of even those with wads of money who buy Picassos to hang in their living rooms or over the craps table at a casino in Vegas.  Ideas cannot flourish in an environment where the bottom line is all that matters and it is unethical and immoral to continue to perpetuate the myth that ideas are flourishing in an environment when they are not. Oh sure, patents are flourishing. Grants are coming in, but again, these are bottom line details, meanwhile I graduated with people who could barely form coherent sentences let alone think for themselves, write a poem that didn't suck, create a truly artistic community for the betterment of mankind. Buyer beware. You can't legislate morality, at least you can't legislate morality when really freakishly huge sums of money are involved, that is free enterprise. Legislating morality when little or no money is involved is called upholding community standards. We might well poo-poo the people who are a little out of step with their time and place, those freaky-deaky ones who see things from a slightly different perspective, the ones who take time out to create things that do not have a readily available market, but I assure you, their worth, though not easily estimable is great. Who creates the music and movies? Who writes the books and TV shows? Who invented the jalapeÃ±o popper? Freaks, geeks and weirdoes, people with the ability to step outside the everyday and look not into the future that probably will be, but into the future that might be, that could possibly be.  Even the personal computer was created by Steve Jobs of Apple, a man more artist than techie. Universities, far from unleashing the human potential, have started to become the places artists and thinkers USED to hang out at.

      Well it has been one infuriating week in Council Bluffs, my hometown. I know how frustrating it can be for the good people of Council Bluffs to see and hear news reports that deal with them, talk about them, sit in judgment of them and  insult their integrity and intelligence. It is especially frustrating because we really have no way to answer charges except through the very same Omaha media that insult us so unless we have a very newsworthy press conference to offer, we can forget about voicing a response.  I grew up on a steady diet of this nonsense, news reports from the other side of the river casting stones and aspersions the size of houses over here as if they were no more hurtful than stray bullets from the Omaha Police Department firing range. We have suffered year and after year of insults from Hal Daub, cracks from co-workers about "the blue plate special," Iowa jokes that are about as funny and original as the "Polack" jokes they were stolen from. We have had to put up with newspaper stories written with bile, bitterness and bias that would kill a donkey. Stories describing our hamlet as "a gritty city," insinuating that we are somehow people of a lesser quality than our brethren across the river. We have suffered the slings and arrows of low brow humorists, ignorant comedians, pitiful Omaha mayors and perhaps the the lowest of all media life forms - morning zoo DJs, people who have as little talent as they do awareness that being number in this market is about as impressive as being voted most likely to succeed by all the other guys on cell block C. And then we have the Santos shooting. An unfortunate event for which we must all say up front so no one thinks us cruel, hateful, bigoted or disrespectful, "Our sympathy to the family. Lo ciento mucho. We are sorry for your loss." And I am.  While I was sitting in that press conference at El Alamo restaurant watching the family have their misery paraded in front of all those reporters, I had a hard time maintaining my composure let alone my professionalism. I do not apologize for that. I have a great deal of sympathy and compassion for anyone who loses someone they love. So with that in mind, I would encourage any and all members of the Santos family to not read this column. Because while it might deal with this situation, it is in no way meant to add to your pain, but sometimes we must discuss these painful issues loudly and publicly and we cannot afford to hold back out of respect for the dead or out of pity for their families. Such is public discourse. Losing someone you love to violence must be confusing. You are angry and you don't know what to do with your anger. You look for answers, "why did this happen?"  Finding someone to blame is the next best thing and if we all had a man like Ben Salazar of Nuestro Mundo, Omaha's Latino activist newspaper, behind us when tragedy struck, I am sure we would all have found someone in Council Bluffs to blame.  One easily gets the sense that Salazar is doing his best to help the Santos family or at least help them see things his way. Most of them don't speak English, so someone has to convince them the Council Bluffs police are racists in spite of notions to the contrary. Alberto Gonzalez, a South Omaha Latino who works with gangs to try and stop the violence in that section of the city, became a kind of hero to me during that news conference when he spoke up and asked Salazar when members of the Latino community were going to start taking responsibility for their actions. He struck me as a wise man who knows that often in these situations, it is the difficult middle ground where truth can be found. Only hatred and division lie in the extreme allegations that have been flying at the CBPD. Accusations that fly at all of us, fellow citizens, make no mistake of that.  The CBPD cannot be a bunch of uneducated, undertrained, frightened bigots without all of us joining them up on that cross. And it is a cross. Schmitz and Schott are being hung up to be crucified to die for our imagined sins by the Omaha media whose first questions in these situations always sound more like accusations than queries. "Did this happen because the Council Bluffs police are poorly trained or because they are bigots?" It would no more occur to our friends in Omaha that we are every bit their equals than it would dawn on them that in most significant ways, our state is superior to theirs in terms of wealth, population and education. The fact that Omaha is bigger than Council Bluffs changes nothing. We have twice the people, a longer history and enough farm power to feed the world and we don't have to answer to those people. Council Bluffs business men made Omaha so they could continue to operate in a lawless territory and not that much has changed. These are the same people who brought the world Charles Starkweather after all.  Which brings me to the man of the hour or should I say buck-passing soccer organizer who obviously does not see his responsibility for this mess, Maurice Alvarez. Maurice is the vice-president of the soccer league that came over to our pastoral city with a couple thousand fans in tow and did nothing to organize security for the event. He admitted having foreknowledge of the potential for great violence when he was trying to shift blame to Lyle Chase, recreation superintendent of Council Bluffs Parks and Recreation Department. This kid has the unmitigated gall to stand up in front of God and everyone at this press conference, right next to the family of Mr. Santos and point the finger at everyone but himself.  He claims he told Chase there could be violence and asked if they could get a couple cops out there. For the benefit of the media, it was made to sound like full disclosure followed by a blatant disregard for life based on an obvious, if completely unprovable, bigotry against Latinos. Even if Alvarez had disclosed everything he suspected to Chase, it isn't Lyle Chase's job to stop Omaha gang violence at soccer games, though I suspect he would have done so by canceling the game, an outcome I doubt Alvarez would have tempted with full disclosure of fact. Alvarez, you should have called the cops ahead of time yourself, instead of waiting to call the cops at the last minute once the violence imminent. You should have hired off-duty officers to work your game. Why would you come over here and expect the cops to be able to handle a crowd that large with any notice?  We have eight cops on duty at any given time for the entire city. That is not a bad thing, far from it. That is plenty of cops to handle day-to-day operations in Council Bluffs. They are not required by the citizens they serve and protect, Council Bluffs residents, to handle Omaha gang problems. The Latino population of Council Bluffs has no problem with THEIR police, I know because I've asked them. I didn't ASSUME racism and neither should the Omaha Latino community or the Omaha media. Every blurry detail Alvarez told and/or retold, involved him telling somebody else that he was not going to be responsible for what he suspected might happen. He knew people had weapons. He saw a man with a gun at halftime. He told the coaches at halftime if they continued with the game even though he thought a major brouhaha was about to unfold that he would not be responsible. Well, I've got news for you, Mr. Alvarez, you don't get to choose not to be responsible any more than Dana Schott or Dale Schmitz got to choose. While I'm going on about the police, I want to be clear about something. I am not a great fan of the police. I've had one or two mess with me when I was in high school because they thought they could get away with it, a story I will tell at another time. I do not support everything they do unconditionally. I do not worship them from afar. I am not a hard-core advocate of total, clamp-down-style law and order. I find most cops arrogant, standoffish and prone to at least casual fascism. Too many cops for my liking tend to don crew cuts, black gloves, jack boots and mirror shades. Most of them prefer to emulate Judge Dredd than Officer Friendly and I think that is a great shame. I don't apologize for my impressions of their profession any more than they apologize for disliking my profession. It isn't personal and we both find individuals of merit on both sides.  So do not mistake my support of the police in this issue as unconditional love because it isn't and if I thought they were wrong, I would rail about that.  All the facts are not in just yet, but one thing is clear to me, Officer Schmitz and Officer Schott were doing their jobs under difficult circumstances. Santos could have been a saint in his daily life, but he fired a gun in a public place, he left them with no choice but to shoot him. Speculation about warning him to drop the gun or just shooting him in the shoulder after he fired his revolver is the kind of ludicrous theorizing that falls under the weight of its own ridiculousness. Firing weapons in crowds is no more acceptable in Council Bluffs than it is in Omaha or the rest of the United States. Our officers are well-trained at the state academy, they aren't farmers who strap on squirrel guns part-time for kicks and they deserve our support in this issue. They did what was required under the law. They were put in a situation they shouldn't have had to face if it had not been for the completely irresponsible actions of Maurice Alvarez. We need to stop taking shots from across the river and start firing back. We need to stop rolling over and playing the beat dog and start biting the hand that insults every time an Omaha reporter, TV news anchor or FoxSports "personality" decides to take their shots at "Counciltucky." The days of our taking it lying down are over and the days or our standing up like great, proud Iowans we are descended from are just beginning.

      A subject on many people's minds this week is cloning, the process by which DNA can be taken from one person and used to create a genetically identical copy. It freaks people out, quite frankly, to think that scientists might one day be able to make a copy of a human being just as easily as they Xerox dirty jokes around the office. "They're tampering in God's domain," the public cries. "It's just plain wrong or at least it feels pretty hinky when they make clones in all those science fiction movies." Well, the truth is that cloning, while creepy, is no less creepy than many other scientific and medical advances we consider routine, but just don't worry about. Personally, I find those potato/tomato plants disturbing. I mean, my God, it's tomatoes up top and potatoes down below all on the same plant! That's not according to God's plan. Who needs that anyway? If you want tomatoes, plant tomatoes. If you want potatoes, buy them, they aren't worth planting. I'm not a big fan of tangeloes either. You tell me oranges and tangerines were both lacking something so intangible that only combining the two could solve the problem? When you take two decent fruits and combine them into one mediocre fruit, that is not only bizarre, it is pointless as well. Why not combine bananas and strawberries into one perfect potassium rich super fruit. Makers of smoothies around the world will thank you for that one. I don't remember seeing broccoflowers in the Bible anywhere either. Nor do I remember Jesus traipsing around Galilee with any number of the absolutely freaky varieties of dogs that exist today only because man decided to play God. I've seen all Jesus's movies - not one poodle. No, chances are if we, as a race, were ever to anger God with our science, it happened when we split the atom just to make a bigger bomb. Tampering with the fabric of the universe to find a way to kill a lot more people faster strikes me as "on God's list of thou shalt nots" somehow. People seem to pick and choose when they let things that may be immoral, unethical or against God's will affect them. Morality and ethics are complicated issues, after all. Sometimes you fell like a nut, sometimes you don't. God said "Be fruitful and multiply," but the caveat was "if you are able." If you want to breed and are unable to do so, you have my sympathy, but maybe that is just God's way of saying he doesn't think you should. Fertility drugs bring hope to millions of infertile couples who turn around and pop out five, six or even seven babies. In a world of over 6 billion human beings, is it really wise to veto God by having a litter of humans? Yet we routinely call that kind of tampering a miracle.  When I was a kid, if you got cancer, you died. Today, people beat cancer all the time. The same goes for any number of diseases and I am sure AIDS will be next on the hit list. Again, we call the scientifically derived cures miracles.  Some of these cures involve transplanting organs from one person to another, radiation, blood transfusion and technologies I could not begin to describe.  Stem cell research is the next huge step in curing everything from diabetes to Parkinson's Disease to paralysis. Can you imagine? Paralysis wasn't even on the list of hopefuls five years ago and now anything is possible. We praise many of these cures and techniques that change our fates, fates God may or may not have had in store for us. Telling God when you trump one of his decisions that it is a miracle sounds like sacrilege, but I don't think we should turn back the clock.  Why not just call these things what they are, man's attempt to do what he can to improve his quality of life and if that means cloning new organs instead of taking them from dead people, baboons or pigs, so be it. Cloning is not Pandora's Box. If at some point cloning proves to be a bad idea, aspects of it can easily be banned. Right now, the potential for human achievement is too great to be slamming the door on cloning. But don't worry, no one is going to be making copies of you any time soon. Your genetic material is yours and that right extends to whatever person is created from your DNA. Mad scientists are not going to be creating armies of slaves to do their bidding and you can't be replaced by your clone even if people like him better than you. There are already people running around with your DNA, they're called kids and chances are that even if you did make a clone of yourself, it would be as dissimilar from you as they are. Because while scientists could copy you, they couldn't copy your life experience, education and memories. But give them a decade or two - anything's possible. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. He can be contacted at 328-1811 Ext. 279 or by e-mail at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      With the sun providing an L.A.P.D.-style beat-down, it is difficult to imagine summer is going into its final leg. Since a great many of you recent high school graduates are enjoying your last summer of childhood and are dangerously close to heading off to college, I thought now would be a good time to tell you and your parents there is still time to change your minds.  "What's that, college boy? You say you're tryin' to talk people OUTTA goin' to college?" Yes, that's right, I am.  "But why, college boy, why?" Well, I will tell you. You see, college is like sex - no matter what you think you are getting yourself into, chances are what actually happens will leave you feeling disappointed, humiliated and in debt up to your eyeballs. The benefits of college are not what they seem. It is a double-edged sword. College is just not for everyone, in spite of the fact that all your life, teachers have been telling you if you want to make something of yourself, you'd better go to college. Nice message for the kids who aren't going to college, by the way. "But I thought college was supposed to be a positive experience." Well, you'd be wrong, chief. The truth is, college does have its moments. I made out with a gymnast once, for example, something that would never have happened if I hadn't gone to college. But, largely, it is a waste of time and money. College is not what it used to be. Back in the day, the university was a place of learning, pure and good. Iowa's land grant universities, by mandate of the Morrill Act, operated to educate the masses. They took that duty seriously and offered it at a reasonable rate. Classes on everything from new agricultural techniques and advances in engineering to history, literature and philosophy helped to create a race of super-smart farmers and mechanics who have made Iowa the enlightened oasis of knowledge it is today. But times have changed, and just as sure as global warming will fry us all where we stand, college is a waste of time and money for half the people who go. A university education used to mean that when you graduated, chances were pretty high you would be a much better and well-rounded person than when you went in. Today, most people come out just as stupid as when they went in, but they have a piece of paper that says otherwise. Universities once taught critical thought, logic, communication skills, and if you were not learning, you did not graduate. Today, any monkey can graduate from college in four or five years because universities are big business. They need your butts in their lecture halls and your cash in their pockets to keep the show running and make their profile look good.  Good to who? To corporations that choose which schools to invest in, based on such criteria as how many national merit scholars go there and how much university research benefits corporate America. How willing is the average American university to sell out to corporate greed? Very, because universities today ARE corporate; but that is not the way it is supposed to work.  Universities should be sacred, like churches. Sure, money changes hands in both; I'm not naive. But they are still supposed to be a place where money is not the raison d'etre, the reason for being. Ironically, corporations aren't impressed with the university degree in your pocket. They know just how devalued degrees have become, because they helped to devalue them. Oh, the engineering firms need to know you have a degree in engineering, but they are much more impressed by your internships. Advanced degrees are almost mandatory anymore. Big Business could care less if you have a degree in archaeology, communication or Sanskrit. But if you have an M.B.A., you could be a sociopath and still get on. Being a sociopath is actually helpful in today's competitive market. Universities have turned into very expensive trade schools, so why not be smart and go to one of those instead? If you want the kind of enlightenment philosophy, history and literature bring, then get a library card and read books on your own time. Or wait a couple of years until you are old enough to appreciate your education. College is wasted on 18-year-olds. Very few people leave high school prepared to go to a major university and get what they are paying for. It doesn't even occur to them that they will need to.  I highly recommend soul-crushing labor in some filthy telemarketing outfit for a few years. Only prison is better for making you take your life seriously.  So, to sum up, if you don't know what you want to do when you go to college or if you suspect you might not be quite on the ball, don't be afraid to put off college until you are old enough to appreciate your education. If you just want to be rich, I suggest you go to truck-driving school or become a plumber. If you want to learn about the world, read books on your own, travel or join the Army, preferably the American one. Whatever you do, don't expect college to spoon-feed you your future. "Thanks, college boy!" No problem. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. He can be reached at 328-1811, ext. 279, or at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com

      We are living in Roman times. Bad craziness fills the air. Life is moving fast, at the speed of stupidity, in fact. Scientists will tell you nothing moves faster than the speed of light, but they are wrong, stupidity does. It is contagious. One person gets a bad idea and before the day is done, half the planet is thinking the same thing.  We are convinced that we must do things now, quick, faster, hurry up. Change lanes, talk on your cell phone, download Pink Floyd albums in 2.5 seconds. Instant gratification? That's not good enough. I want to be rich, good-looking and loved and I want it yesterday. Disappointment? That's for foreigners, I'm an American and Constitutionally guaranteed happiness at all times, check it out, chief. Intelligence? Patience? Faith? No thanks.  We put all this pressure on ourselves in endless varieties too plentiful to account for here. The world is full of wonders on the one hand and vacuous nonsense on the other. It is easy to be confused. Serenity is harder to come by these days than meaning. How can we expect our kids to process it all? How can we help? Especially when the topic is suicide. Suicide is a sensitive subject. When suicide rears itself, it leads to a psychological plague like we are seeing in Harlan. Two teens killed themselves in the last two months and nearly a dozen others from the class of 2002 have attempted it. Panic is natural and answers are few and far between. We are tempted to deal with these situations with exceeding tact, reverence and respect. A big mistake.  We cannot afford to give kids the impression that if they commit suicide, out attention and focus will finally be with them and them alone, on the tragedy which is their untimely death.  The worst thing we can do is focus dramatic attention on the subject. Teens are histrionic enough as it is, some are in very real pain and we want to help. It is a catch-22 and I hate catch-22s. I don't want to disrespect the dead or their families, but at the same time I don't want any more kids thinking that suicide is the answer for their teenage angst. It is sick, but suicide becomes this hideous fashion statement to convince others of your pain.  Ironically, I hate talking about myself. But before anyone gets the chance to wonder what makes me an expert or gives me the authority to dish out advice on this subject, I'll tell you because I don't want there to be any misunderstandings later on. I have been clinically depressed since I was about 13. I was undiagnosed until around my mid-20s when social circumstances, bad brain chemicals and what the French call "ennui" forced my condition into sharp relief. Thinking about suicide was part of the package and I mean REALLY thinking about it hard, too. It seemed easy, like the right thing to do, like the inevitable outcome of a meaningless life. All that existentialist crap I read in college didn't help much either.  So I know what I am talking about and while I don't have degree in suicide prevention, I do have some ideas on the subject. Suicide is like sex, drugs and rock -n- roll, it has an unfortunate mystique. Poets do it, rock stars do it. Curt Cobain did it. Chris Farley self-destructed in a hedonistic binge. They got all sorts of attention for it and kids notice these things. We need to stop that attention, it's too positive. I think getting everyone together in a big room to listen to a lecture about not committing suicide is a bad idea, it's too impersonal and dehumanizing. If you think your kids are at risk or even if you don't think that, people need to be loved. Nothing makes temporary problems seem bigger-than-life than not having anyone around you who cares enough to notice and talk to you like a human being. If you have a family, turn off your television or better yet, get the whole family together and shoot it in the back yard because that demon is destroying us all. You will find it is much easier to communicate with each other if the TV is either off or in a couple hundred pieces in the back yard. If you are a kid thinking about suicide, let me assure you, anything is better. Think about the last time you thought about suicide and all the good stuff that's happened between that time and this time. No matter how bad you feel now, life doesn't get good until much later, it's just those crazy hormones talking. They are like a drug, but the potency wears off later and gives you some clarity. Lay off the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" platitudes because that kind of drivel only comforts people who don't really need it. A warm corn muffin with real butter might make grandma feel all nostalgic, but it doesn't do much for a kid with death on his mind. And remember, we're all in this together. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. He can be contacted at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.

      This may be my last column for some time because this week I found myself trapped in a logical argument that requires me to move to China. This argument was so completely solid and airtight that it would have suffocated Socrates. After I suggested that most Asian and European students might actually be better educated than American students because of a greater emphasis on education and the predominance of year-round schooling, it was suggested that if I thought that I should move there. Upon hearing this rationalistic ultimatum, I instantly turned into one of those old "Star Trek" computers. Unable to escape this crafty "logic trap," my head began to smoke, my eyes blinked with an involuntary flutter and I walked about the office muttering to myself until I simply shut down. I had been confronted with the classic "love it or leave it" gambit, to which, there is apparently no defense. "Curses!" I shouted as I packed my subtitled copy of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," my well-seasoned wok and my annotated edition of "The Private Life of Chairman Mao" by Zhisui Li.  If only there were some way out of it but there wasn't.  I had suggested we might try something to improve education in our small corner of America and for that, I had to move. Goodbye, sweet freedom. Hello, Beijing. At least I'll be on hand for the Olympics. And then I realized that "America - love it or leave it" was one of the most asinine, low brow and anti-American suggestions ever posed by the Bumper Sticker Publishers Group of America. It's right down there with "S--- Happens," "My other car is a Porsche," "I brake for shoe sales" and "My kid can beat up your honors student." Why so many Americans utter this statement with pride confounds me since most bumper stickers of this variety are actually made in China to begin with. Coincidence? I think not. The thing I have always thought was great about America - the America of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Thomas Paine and all those other guys on the back of the $100 bill - is that you can criticize it AND love it at the same time. No one has to move anywhere. But I am glad for this opportunity to examine the "love it or leave it" theory of American politics. For years I have been frustrated by this statement. In a country founded on civil disobedience, it is frustrating that so many Americans take comfort in a slogan that is anti-political, anti-activist, anti-free expression and pro-apathy. No where in the Constitution does it say that Americans are obligated to sit by and watch our country degenerate. Since when does doing nothing  prove how much we love America? Is that the attitude that killed all those Nazis? America is like a fina automobile, it requires proper maintenance to keep it running well. The price of freedom is constant vigilance not bland acceptance. There are millions of Americans from 50 very different states of countless ethnic origins, creeds, religions and opinions. If we take into account the multitude of separate, personal interests and multiply those by region, state, county, city, social class, political perspective, age, generation, wealth and educational level we have a combinatorial statistical explosion which basically means it is a wonder that any two people in the United States ever agree on anything long enough to form a consensus let alone a poltical party. Of course we disagree. I do not find people who have nothing to complain about all that patriotic.  While the drone of hopeless whining can become tiresome, this great country of ours is far too big and lumbering for anyone to find it perfect. Show America you care. Find something you don't like and try and change it. Here are few things I don't like about America. I don't like that pride of ignorance has replaced common sense, that road rage has replaced rugged individualism, that "me first" has replaced common decency.  I especially dislike that TV has replaced just about everything else of value. I do not care much at all for our opinion-stifling political process that has given us two virtually identical political parties from which to choose the lesser of two evils.  I hate corporate boy bands, teen sex kittens, Kathy Lee Gifford and everything they stand for. There are a lot of things I do like about America that make it worth fighting for. Random acts of kindness, the indignity we feel when others get screwed over, our willingness to help the less fortunate, stand-up comedians, political satire. I love that we have the best writers in the world: Hunter S. Thompson, Truman Capote, Flannery O'Connor, Jane Smiley, Kurt Vonnegut and William Faulkner. I love rock 'n' roll, activism, Woody Guthrie and everything they stand for. So the next time you feel tempted to say, "if you don't like it move somewhere else," feel free to take your own advice because my America was founded by guys who didn't like all kinds of things about their country and did something about it.

      I don't know if it's the heat exhaustion or my neighbor's dog talking, but I can't go to a record store, drive-thru or movie theater without being confronted by the cream of today's youth looking at me vacantly and saying "you want cheese on what?" when I clearly asked for the time. And when I say "cream," I mean it, these are our best and brightest, the one's with jobs working hard to buy all that stuff kids like: Tattoos,  piercings, CDs of the hardcore rap-metal music, organically grown medicinal herbs and T-shirts with dirty words on them. It's gotten so bad, I feel like I need an interpreter just to go to the video store.  Me: "Do you have 'Traffic?!'" Kid behind counter: "Uuuuhhh... what?" Translator: "Dude, you got that movie with that guy, right, who was in that 'way' movie about the gun with that other guy, not the white guy, the other dude?' Kid behind counter: "Oh, s'over there." Translator: "Yes, we do, sir, it just came in. It's in the New Releases section along the back wall between the one row of science fiction and the four rows of Gene Hackman movies." The answer is clear, we need to send our kids to school year round. This three months of vacation has just got to stop. It makes the job of teachers harder, it makes kids lazy, wastes everyone's time at the beginning of the year playing catch up, gives kids too much time to do nothing but look for trouble and ultimately undermines the economic prosperity of the United States. I went to college with people who could barely read let along think logically. If it weren't for lax admission standards, they would never have gotten in. Our community schools should operate like well-run indoctrination camps: Constant repetition, gray uniforms, regular intense physical activity and healthy portions of inexpensive, nutritional gruel - like in England. A mind, like a good cliche, is a terrible thing to waste. A couple weeks off is more than enough time for our little darlings to recuperate from the strenuous activity that is learning. Young minds need to be kept active and given the choice between thinking and taking root in front of the TV, most kids will veg out every time. I know because I too spent summer's doing as little as possible. Luckily for my brain, I didn't have cable so I had to read. I still ended up stupid compared to my counterparts from other countries and for that, I am eternally bitter.  It is necessary for the mature grown up ones in this society to make sure the next generation of Americans have Ginsu sharp minds so they can grow up smart enough to truly appreciate just how miserable they are working 40 hours a week. Countries like Japan and China keep their kids in school continually. As a result, they respect knowledge and the fruit it brings. True, some of those kids are high strung and you hear about stress-induced suicides, but that's rare. Somehow I suspect our kids wouldn't stress out.  In fact, giving our kids something to do besides sitting around complaining about how much stuff you haven't bought them yet would probably help keep morale up. It would certainly do wonders for mine.  You hear a lot of talk about kids and their self-esteem these days. It is important to help children feel good about themselves. But nothing helps a kid's self-esteem like possessing normal intelligence. So pack them in year round, fill their heads with ideas, teach them Latin, French and Spanish. Make sure every one of them can do calculus, play an instrument and read at the college level before they graduate. Teach them to rebuild an engine, throw pots and sing arias. Explore the human potential that lives inside each child. And let's make them wear uniforms while we're at it. My sister, not a conservative woman, said something funny the other day. "Girls dress like whores these days." Now, I don't want to judge and lord knows I'm no fashion expert, but if backless shirts, tube tops and platform shoes are what hookers wear, so be it. In school, it just isn't appropriate. Learning is hard enough without doing it in the middle of Times Square. The boys are no better, they all look like they just got out of the joint. Here's a tip guys, baggy pants are helpful when Tito from cell block C is eying you, but outside OZ, they just slow you down. A skinny punk in a T-shirt three sizes too big just looks like an even skinnier punk. Out of school, do you what you want, but in school, it should be uniform time. Sensible, professional and studious clothes will make educating kids less distracting, make social distinctions meaningless and be ultimately cheaper for parents.  In 50 years, economists say China will be THE economic superpower. At that point, we aren't going to be able to entice smart people to come to the United States. They will just stay in China because the money is better. You can only be rich and stupid for so long so before the money runs out, America, so let's learn them kids good.

      Warning: This column contains dangerous levels of sarcasm, dark humor and gratuitous derogatory references to  ill-conceived marketing schemes. Sensitive readers, children and anyone with relatives in the Greater North Dakota Association may wish to exercise caution or choose to not read at all. According to CNN, the Associated Press and at least 13 late night comedians I've seen so far, the chamber of commerce for the state of North Dakota, the Greater North Dakota Association, is getting behind a proposal to change the name of their state to simply "Dakota." They feel  the "North" in "North Dakota" is giving people the idea that North Dakota is a frigid, treeless prairie in spite of the hundreds of Westerns filmed in that state showing otherwise. Former governor of North Dakota, Ed Schafer said, "People have such an instant thing about how North Dakota is cold and snowy and flat. We're not going to change that overnight. But [a name change] would get a lot of attention. Personally, I think it would be fun." Fun, Ed? Like grandma's birthday party fun or like waiting at the dentist on new magazine day fun? This may be the most brilliant marketing scheme since Benjamin Franklin told Thomas Jefferson, "Maybe instead of 'Up yours, England!' we should call it 'The Declaration of Independence' ... class it up, you know?" In an Associated Press story, some state officials worry the plan might subject North Dakota to national ridicule and abuse on a par with dirty swirlies and atomic wedgies. Gee, d'ya think? Dakota IS a great name, that's why there is not a strip club in the United States that doesn't have at least two, one for the day shift and a good-looking one at night. Dakota sounds like that kid in "The Outsiders" who gets beat up by the Socs and makes the Greasers itch for a rumble.  "You saved those kids from burning in that church, Dakota, you're a hero."  "Stay gold, Ponyboy."  "I'd like to, Dakota, but I already promised Dallas, Sodapop, Beelzebubba, Junebug and Raspberryripple I'd get me a job sackin' at the Piggly Wiggly." Current governor of North Dakota, John Hoeven said he is willing to listen to arguments for the idea, but said he likes "North Dakota." "I'm more focused in getting out there and talking about all the wonderful things we have here, whether it's quality of work force, quality environment, great tourism, great education," he said. He failed to mention the fact that there hasn't been one reported case of settlers being overrun by Indians in North Dakota for nearly 17 years. That's got to count for something. This would mark the first time a state has changed its name since Mosquito Infested Hellhole changed its name to Lousiana.  Research on this marketing scheme could open the door for other less-than-funky or dork states to do likewise. It also raises a number of issues. First off, it IS cold in North Dakota, who are they kidding? They should change the name to Cold Dakota. When I hear "North Carolina" I don't think cold. The "North" isn't the issue, reality is. South Dakota is no doubt unhappy about the proposal because they are going to look like the lesser Dakota and that's just not true. All Dakotas are equal. They will have to change their name to something like "Orignal Dakota" or "Dakota Lite" to keep up.  Then Nebraska is going to realize that when people think "Nebraska," they think of corn and truck driving schools so they will have to change their name to "Tranquilvania" or maybe "France" to beef up there image. What about Kansas and Arkansas? Basically they have the same name but one has an "Ar" in front of it. Don't Europeans get confused when making  vacation plans in these states?  And let's not even get started on the whole Iowa-Idaho-Ohio conundrum that has confused scholars and "Tonight Show" guests alike for decades. No one can ever remember which state grows what. Should we help them out with additional info in the title like CornIowa, SpudIdaho or The-One-With-Cleveland-In-It-Ohio? Maybe Iowa just needs a good tagline. We might then write our address as Council Bluffs, Iowa, You Make Me Smile Like That Keven Costner Movie 50011. Or maybe changing a state's name for giggles is just a heinously bad idea cooked up by the kind of money-grubbing and thoughtless kind of people who invented New Coke.  Unless you are going from "Indian Territory" to "Oklahoma" or you want to split off from Virginia and remain part of the Union, you should not be changing the name of your state just to manipulate the impression people have of you.  If the impression people have of your state is accurate, but you would like to modify it, try a more traditional and less Orwellian  add campaign like "North Dakota: It's Hot As Hell Up Here" or "North Dakota: It's 20-1 Gals to Guys, You Do The Math!" In other stupid ideas, I am going to be in a rib-eating contest at Bluffs Run's Barbecue Festival Saturday, July 7. Come for the spectacle, stay for the brisket! Stay gold, North Dakota!

      Like most upstanding, moral Americans, I was horrified Wednesday to hear the news of Andrea Yates murder of her five young children in Houston. It struck me as well to learn she lived in the same small suburb of Houston I once dwelled in briefly as though the possibility of a brief past encounter meant I had come too close to evil. It makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up in a fit of irrationality.  It is hard to comprehend how anyone, especially a mother, could drown her children in a bathtub. Andrea Yates's husband Russell has made a public plea for his wife saying she suffers from postpartum depression and attempted suicide after the birth of the couple's fourth son in 1999, according to a CNN report. Depression or not, it is a hard nut to swallow. Most of us are not wired to kill under any circumstances let alone commit an act as vile as infanticide.  When we hear of such horrors, we begin instantly trying to make sense of the crime as if that could make us feel better. Our minds like to create order when none exists. Sometimes, it is just not possible and we have to rely on old standbys. Our instinct is to see Andrea Yates as evil and deserving of the harshest punishment because then can we say to ourselves, "now everything is back to normal, justice has been served." Unfortunately, it just isn't that easy. Putting Andrea Yates to death would only serve to make a horrific act all the more tragic. This is not a woman who killed her children because her new boyfriend wanted her to. This is not a woman whose children died of neglect. What Andrea Yates is is much more fundamentally frightening because while her actions were as shocking as any that can be conceived, she may not be that much different from most of us. It is likely she is not evil at all, only deeply disturbed. And if we allow ourselves to believe she did this thing because of medical reasons, then what means it could not happen to us? Arguably, no one is suffering more from this crime right now than Russell Yates. It would be arrogant for us to judge him harshly for asking authorities to treat his wife as a sick woman. Russell Yates has every reason to be scared. His wife is up on a capital charge and no state in the Union is as death happy as Texas. In the brief time I lived there, a Scottish foreign exchange student was shot and killed when he knocked on a door in a good neighborhood and asked to use the phone because his car broke down. Houston rallied around the homeowner as though he were Sam Houston protecting Texas from hated Scottish invasion. The boys parents retrieved their son amidst what looked to them like insanity. It did to me. In my estimation, Russell Yates has less than a week to make his case before the court of public opinion before prosecutor Joe Owmby decides this case will make  his career. Owmby has wasted no time cautiously showing his horror in public for the press. "This is the most horrendous thing I have ever seen," he said. I am certain the moment the public decides they want to see Yates dead for her crime, all ethical and moral considerations will fly straight out the door. Yates's Defense attorney Bob Scott has wisely asked for a gag order to prevent attorneys in this case from talking to the press, according to CNN. He knows how the system works. Justice in America is  a sound bite away from meaning anything. One year it means a slap on the wrist for a first-time offender, the next it means making and example of that offender. One month it means getting revenge for the victim, the next it means getting closure for victim's families.  The truth is, justice should not be this malleable. Flexible, yes, but not amorphous and unpredictable.  What is SUPPOSED to be reliable and comforting about justice is that it is even-handed and fair.  Justice is an ancient concept. Flavius Anicius Julianus Justinianus was emperor of Rome from 527 to 565 A.D. (Catholic Encyclopedia). His great contribution to the world was "Corpus Juris Civilis," a four-volume work from which modern civil law descends. It contained all the laws of Rome in one easy-to-read collection making the law available to all and their execution consistent. His name is where we get the word "justice." Not a bad legacy to leave the world when one considers the option is virtual chaos.  Of course, Justinian, as emperor, did not have to worry about getting elected either. If he had, our justice system today would no doubt look more like "American Gladiator" than it already does. Public opinion is no place for crime and punishment to be decided. The average person, possessed by fears, memories and wildly oscillating opinions, is not capable of deciding guilt or innocence in front of a TV news camera. That is why we have a code of law. In the case of Andrea Yates, removal from society and intense medical treatment is the least we can do, not just for her, but for ourselves. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

       (This is the one that got me my Master Columnist Award)  You know you are getting old when you start thinking of teenagers as the "kids these days." I suppose it was inevitable I would hit an age when I could no longer maintain my hipness in the face of change. I have tried for as long as possible to maintain my youthfulness. I have used a combination of staying in college for an obscenely long time, only making friends with 20-year-olds, avoiding long-term employment and never saying things like "well, THAT'S different."  Most importantly, I remain willing to adapt to new and bizarre trends like the Internet, hard-core white rap, bare ass on TV, stuffed crust pizza, a president called Dubya, MTV's "Jackass," a world without Walter Mathau, people who think latte is something more than really strong coffee with milk in it and FoxNews. Failing to keep up with change will give you a case of future shock big enough to kill a llama. The worst cases leave you a broken shut-in afraid to leave the house, but the mild cases are almost worse. They create in some minds the idea that what is cool peaked in 1985. People stuck in another decade will tell you no good music has been made since Starship broke up and that rap cannot possibly last even though it has been around for nearly 30 years. I will admit that I am more old-fashioned than I care to admit in some areas and on one subject in particular. That subject is more taboo than strip poker on Sunday. If you are sensitive, turn away now because no one wants to force you to absorb the following opinion. Ready?  I have a lingering attachment to corporal punishment. Corporal punishment is a fancy, Latin way of saying "hitting people." We need to bring hitting back into vogue.  When did corporal punishment become synonymous with abuse? I decry abuse and despise the abusive, but I think it is wrong to dismiss simple spanking as abusive, in fact, it is quite the opposite. When you spare the rod, you spoil the child.  Grandma was right because children are not morally responsible individuals capable of understanding the difference between right and wrong. You cannot have an intelligent discussion with a 5-year-old about the ethical consequences of their actions. You cannot explain to someone who has no real understanding of pain let alone a realistic concept of their own mortality why they should not run out into traffic. "Why" shouldn't enter into it, only "because I said so."  By the time most kids get to their teens these days, they are uncontrollable, borderline sociopaths capable of anything from harassing the elderly to school shootings. Don't blame video games, the media and Marilyn Manson. Blame the namby-pamby policies that make it impossible for a parent to grab their kids by the arm in a public place and tell them if they do not stop screaming, they are going to get paddled. A quick survey of the malls and grocery stores of Council Bluffs should be enough to convince most intelligent, moral and right-thinking individuals that not enough children are being hit in just the right way to convince them that proper standards of behavior must be observed. At exactly what point did it become acceptable for kids to walk around like a bunch of little animals? As the French say, here's an example: I'm walking into Super Saver last week and some 13-year-old, white, middle-class Snoop Dogg wannabe is walking out behind his mother who is pushing about $165 worth of groceries. I was minding my own business, though I might have been wondering why this kid wasn't pushing the cart for his mother, when Lil' Eminem fixes me with a steely, Clint Eastwood-style glare like he's gonna bust a cap in my face for looking at him the wrong way. And I think to myself, what kind of "Children of the Corn" guano is this? Back in the day, kids didn't mess with adults. We weren't smarter or better, we just had a healthy fear for the consequences. So many kids today are ill-mannered thugs looking for an excuse to prove you are powerless to stop them from going all "Lord of the Flies" whenever the urge strikes.  When it started to occur to me that "these kids today" were worse than when I was a kid, I dismissed it as the first sign of old age. A quick survey of friends, family and former teachers convinced me I was not just getting old, but that we have created a generation of mean-spirited monsters. One teacher I talked to said any complaints he had about "dirty hippies" in the '70s was premature because those students were at least civil to each other once in a while. Students of the '90s were so mean, he said, it was truly frightening. And the cause for all of this incivility? People just don't hit their kids enough.   What happened to the America of the past, the one I knew and loved growing up? When parents could spank their kids for pushing at the public pool or give them a mild slap on the mouth for cussing? What happened to that country where parents could threaten their kids to keep them in line? Does anyone honestly think we are living in a better country for sparing the rod?  I believe wholeheartedly that there is nothing wrong with your kids knowing that if they cross the line, they've got a whoopin' coming to them. Respect, common courtesy and healthy fear are not always things you can teach a child about. Sometimes it takes a spanking.

      There is nothing like Council Bluffs in the summer. When I cruise down Broadway, window open, the staccato sounds of classic rock and bad mufflers in my ears, exhaust fumes, humidity and what I assume is corn chips frying at the Frito Lay plant in my nose, it's like ... home.  Summer brings back memories of cruising with high school buddies from what was the parking lot of Sam's Hamburgers down to what was the parking lot of Rog and Scotty's, talking to girls we didn't know, being loud and turning around to do it again for hours. Side trips to Fairmount Park, the Black Angel, the Lincoln Monument and Kwik Shop added to the carnival atmosphere of youth. We could have gone to Des Moines and back on the gas we wasted, but circles were good enough. That was back when INXS was at the top of the charts, gas was 90 cents a gallon and cruising was legal... good times.  Home means many things to many people. I'm sure that for others, Council Bluffs is all about afternoons at Bayliss Park with the grandkids, a night at a casino, a day at the library, Saturday at the Renaissance Faire or hours on a barstool talking to whoever shows up. Vive la difference!  The media captures that sense of home - good and bad. Every town looks at itself through the mirror of the media. Human interest stories, crime, concerts, new business, old business.  Who we are and what we are capable of is often reflected in what we see in our newspaper, on the 10 o'clock news and in original local programming. Without it, all we see is someone else's problems and triumphs. National programming that focuses the good, the bad and the ugly of  the world and not our corner of it.  In Council Bluffs, the vast bulk of our media comes from Omaha. With the exception of The Nonpareil and a radio station here and there, everything comes from across the Missouri. Every TV station is an Omaha station and the news is primarily Nebraska news. If something sensational happens in Iowa, it gets covered, but often we are left to fend for ourselves when it comes to good news, festivals and cultural events - unless there is something odd about them. I remember one May sweeps, KETV did a three part series on lot lizards - truck stop hookers. For three nights a reporter sat at the truck stop parking lot on South 24th taping prostitutes hopping in and out of semis. At the end of the series they disclaimed, "this happens at all truck stops, not just truck stops in Council Bluffs." What audacity. What a vulgar display. Of course it happens everywhere, but not all town have it shoved in their face. How could we not be humiliated. And there we were with little recourse. Now a lot of people will read this and figure that just makes sense, Omaha is big city with all the fixin's and that is just the way life is on the border between two states. That is not always so. This kind of petty disdain is usually reserved for countries in the Balkans. In the Quad Cities, you have Davenport and Bettendorf on the Iowa side and Rock Island and Moline on the Illinois side and in spite of the Mississippi running between them, they have what is basically one city with residents from both sides saying "I am from the QC." And the QC has its own feel. News and especially views are important to a community because they create character, the personality of a city. Council Bluffs is a bit shapeless and often dejected because we don't see our leaders on TV every day. We don't see positive images of Council Bluffs broadcast on a regular basis. We don't have our own local celebrities or hear quotes from our fire chief or police. And we need that. Sad thing is we used to have it. Channel 17 on America Heritage cablevision of Council Bluffs used to put on a local news program. It was raw, public access fair. It was a crude-looking news program without all the slick packaging and graphics we are used to. It was staffed with young, inexperienced reporters and anchors some of us went to high school with. Their mission was an honorable one: Bring the people of Council Bluffs and southwest Iowa their own news, news often overlooked by the affiliate stations in Omaha. Public access TV may seem like something of a joke, but it is quite important. The Federal Communications Commission thought so when it mandated that cable systems reserve channels for public access television. In spite of the cheap-looking, early-70s production values, public access is for anyone from the city council to the the high school Booster club to people with interests from gardening to UFOs. Anyone can get their own show to spout off about whatever subject strikes their fancy. It's the First Amendment in action, a beautiful and sometimes disturbing thing, but self-reflection is not always pretty - unless you're Gwyneth Paltrow. This is something sorely lacking in Council Bluffs and we need to get it back. It is a matter of pride.  Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Several things have been making me think recently. One is a CNN report  Wednesday about what qualifies as "reality TV." Apparently, their is great concern in America that reality TV might not be as real as it can be. Standards may need to be adopted to ensure quality reality is the only thing making its way onto our airwaves. Perhaps some kind of clever expiration date like they have on milk jugs. "Genuine as of June 2," "Watch by July 23 to ensure reality." Also on my mind, a Sunday morning political debate on "Washington Week" about SUVs and efforts to regulate their horrendous gas mileage. One pundit opposed to a minimum standard for gas mileage said Americans deserve to drive whatever kind of gas-guzzlers they want, "Americans are entitled to their standard of living."  Statements like this seem innocuous, but still make me uncomfortable on some level. It seems prideful and immoral to believe that anyone is somehow endowed by God, circumstances, social status or even really hard work to an outrageously high standard of living. I might work like hell for everything I have and make buckets of cash, it doesn't mean I am entitled to roasted bald eagle with buffalo tongue stuffing for dinner. The line has to be drawn somewhere and it seems that in this day and age, expecting a car to get 12 miles to the gallon is not unreasonable. Also twisting my melon, I have been debating whether or not to get cable. I have been satisfied with my local channels though my reception is hideous. I was willing to live without CBS, KYNE, the WB, color on FOX and decent reception on every channel expect KBIN, which was crystal clear. With summer reruns coming, I might actually read a book sometime. I love reading, but will not make the time to do it if I have 70 channels of pabulum to choose from instead.  And harshing my uniquely American mellow this week, I talked to two men who spent the last six months in Kosovo. Kosovo is a mess. It is a bombed-out hole of a province in Yugoslavia with open sewers and a standard of living that makes "The Grapes of Wrath" look like "The Valley of the Dolls." During the course of two fascinating interviews, it came up that as Americans, we forget about places like Kosovo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, the West Bank, North Korea, Cambodia, and the list goes on.  Who doesn't turn the channel as fast as they can when starving children appear? I  do, partly because I don't believe there is much I can do. And I feel guilty because I don't even try while finding plenty of things to complain about that pale next to the world's atrocities. For example, restaurants that serve cheeseburgers without grilling the bun, I hate this and complain endlessly about it to friends and coworkers. Getting cable and finding nothing but infomercials on 50 channels after 2 in the morning. Complaining about taxes even though I know they pay for living in the greatest democracy in the free world, emergency services, police and roads. Paying $6.50 for movie tickets and $7.50 for movie theater concessions. Complaining about the level of reality in my reality TV shows. I don't want to tell CNN how to do their job, but it seems what has become one of the biggest most reliable TV news sources in the world could find time to talk about something more important than how real reality TV is.  Was anybody confused before? Granted a game show should not be rigged, but seven strangers set adrift and left to fend for themselves on a tropical island in the South Pacific forced to perform bizarre, meaningless tasks for the chance to win $1 million dollars is about as real as non-fat "sour cream" and as credible as 900 psychic hotlines.  None of my relationships have been tested on "Temptation Island." I have never traveled with a group of people knowing one of us is traitor. There have been very few times in my life when I have been chained to another person for the viewing pleasure of the public, which reminds me never speed through Louisiana. I've never lived with six strangers picked to live in a mansion while hordes of cameramen film everything from me shaving to me sleeping. The truth is, reality TV is only called that because no one is an actor being paid to play a role and that is about the size of it. Reality shows choose cast members for their diverse backgrounds, so the fur will fly for our amusement. Very little of anything on television is real. Even the news is questionable. What was shown? What was not? Why did they interview this person and not that one? Is there more to the story than a 30 second clip? Is anyone really so concerned about how real their reality TV is?

      Having moved back to my home town a couple months ago after living in Ames for three years, I have to tell you, C.B. is kind of refreshing. Ames is a very middle-class town filled with pampered college students and professors who all have an unrelenting sense of entitlement. The education level is scary high and you would be hard-pressed to know where blue-collar people work. Ames residents believe nothing is too good for them: No band, no public speaker, no presidential candidate. Who can wrap their heads around a city like that?  In comparison, Council Bluffs just makes some kind of sense to me - it always has. This is a working-class town filled with people who get up and go to work every day. They lift, clean, hammer and weld things. Push papers, pills and propositions. These things compute.  Try figuring out a college town. First you have students. They schedule classes so they never have to get up before 10 in the morning if they can help it. They work for maybe two hours a day, occasionally study, drink until 2 a.m. and then skip their first class the next day.  Professors are no easier. They have pretty cushy jobs compared to most human beings. They are either sitting, reading, writing, researching or pontificating. Once they get tenure, they can really relax. And they still complain about it. Yes, Council Bluffs makes something in my head click. We work hard, take potshots from Nebraskans, avoid potholes and complain for GOOD reasons. That makes sense. With Pride Week upon us, I thought now would be a good time to talk about what it means to be proud. Pride is a tricky concept and its discussion should not be limited to one week a year. I show my pride in Council Bluffs all year long the best way I know how: I spend my money here. If I HAVE to buy something that can only be purchased in another town or in another state, I WILL buy it out of necessity. But when it comes to going out to dinner, frequenting lounges, buying CDs, clothes, cars, gas, groceries, books, organically grown medicinal herbs, medical care and other novelty items, I spend my dollars in C.B. When friends come to visit me and want to go someplace cool for dinner I say, there is no place cooler than Pizza King, Sam's Italian Villa or Burgers on Broadway to name only three of many.  If friends want to go to a cool bar, we hit the Scott Street or Dirty Harry's or any of the many fine public houses in Iowa's leading edge. If I want to cruise around a hip two-story bookstore with a cafe in it, I just don't and here's why. Most of the things we think we need to be cool, like nationally franchised theme restaurants, high-priced coffee bars and megalithic, corporate bookstores, we just don't need. It's like when you were in high school and you always wanted to sit at the cool table, remember that? Sure, we all did once. Well, the trick to sitting at the cool table is not to get up the gumption to move over to the other table and get invited to sit. No sir, the real trick is to realize, believe and accept without doubt that the table you are sitting at IS the cool table. Because the only difference between your table and the cool table is the attitude of the people sitting at the table. Since I have been back, I have heard more than a few people say they thought our new library was a little TOO nice for Council Bluffs. That's not possible. If we were paying the Pope to come and read Dr. Seuss books to kids once a month or giving away a car with each new library card, OK, that might be too good for us. But our library is everything a city library should be - no more and no less. It is a repository for books, art, music, in short, culture. It is the heart of any good city and the legacy we leave our children. Saying our library is too good for us is like saying our children do not deserve the best possible education or access to a world of ideas or, more importantly, a place where they can learn to affect that world of ideas. The entire time I lived in Ames, I never once heard a native of that city say they thought their library was too good for them. I also never heard them say they thought their tap water doesn't taste bad enough or that their bus system was too efficient, clean and safe. We are sitting at the cool table, Council Bluffs, do not question that, believe it, revel in it. In New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, people would kill to have our high quality of life and low crime rate. We are well-educated. We are avid readers. We are endowed with common sense and a work ethic from another time. We have history and character. We don't have pretension, inflated egos or callous disregard for human dignity. We help people when they need it. We have distinguished ourselves with valor, bravery and sacrifice in every war the United States has fought since the Civil War and will undoubtedly do it again.  In short, we rock like a hurricane. So when we people ask you if you will be celebrating Pride Week, you tell them you hit the ground running because you have pride all year long.

      I was watching a documentary about the Iceman, a guy who fell asleep in Europe in the snow 5,200 years ago to be thawed out in the 20th Century. No, he wasn't still alive, but he did have a few lessons for us. Scientists picked him apart from hat to colon to learn what they could.  As far as documentaries go, it was pretty cherry with dramatic reenactments of life in 3200 B.C. It wasn't pretty and slick like today.  Fascinating stuff this frozen guy had to show us. He had a copper axe 1,000 years before scientists thought it was possible. That's like finding a TV in the Dark Ages.  He was decked out in his finest goin'-to-the-sacred-tree clothes. Before this, no one had a clue what Neolithic men wore. Apparently they wore animal skins! OK, no surprise. The Iceman was 45, old for a Neolithic man. Three times before he died, his fingernails stopped growing, indicating he suffered three major illnesses and recovered. He had medicinal herbs and tattoos from acupuncture. Primitive medicine, but it worked. Wear on his teeth showed he at a rough bread product. Very interesting. The commercials were almost as educational. One was for Chili and Scoops - corn chip scoops with a tiny bowl of chili in a plastic container inside a brightly painted cardboard box. Microwave the chili, eat it with the scoops - it's fun! I bet the Iceman would be miffed he missed this one. Why would anyone pay for a single serving of chili and a handful of corn chips? Our Neolithic ancestors killed bears for dinner and we can't get it together enough to buy our own can of chili and bag of chips? Then there was one for Kraft cheese cubes. Just cubes of cheddar cheese in a bag. As if cheese weren't expensive enough, I am going to pay someone else to cube it? Recipe for cubed cheese: 1) Buy cheese. 2) Cube it! If you can't do that, you should avoid cheese anyway. If you have money to spend on pre-cubed cheese and never give to charity, you might want to rethink this in case Jesus is watching. And Lunchables, aren't these pretty much crackers and cheese in a box? When I was a kid, if you sent your kid to school with nothing but crackers and cheese, the teacher called social services.  Are they still selling the single-serving cereal bowls in the refrigerated section with the milk? They sell these things so kids can help themselves, but if a kid can't  open a box of cereal how can one crack three layers of cardboard and safety seals to get at a couple ounces of Frosted Flakes? If your kids aren't old enough to figure out a box of cereal, they shouldn't be in the kitchen by themselves. Besides, what kid can't polish off three bowls of sugar-coated anything while watching cartoons? Maybe it started with canned soup, sliced bread and TV dinners. Was that the beginning of the end of self-reliance in America? Or maybe it goes back to the beginning of agrarian society itself. We accept a lot of waste in America: Cans, plastic, aluminum, Robert Downey Jr. episodes of "Ally McBeal," but even so, these products go beyond the pale. Small units increase your cost per unit so where is the up side? I've got to think there is psychological damage as well. Consuming these prepackaged food items is a weird placebo telling us falsely we are better than lesser men. I waste, therefore I am. I am not completely above all this, no one is. Maybe my objection is a working-class thing. When I was a kid, my mom would rather have cut her hands off than buy tiny bags of chips. "Why would I want to spend good money on little bags of chips when we got a whole bag in the cupboard?"  I couldn't believe she didn't get it. Didn't she know chips taste better when they come in designer bags for others to see you have enough money to spend on shiny things? Maybe cheese tastes better when somebody else cubes it, too. Who knows? Not me, because I would never buy pre-cubed cheese. At the end of the Iceman documentary, the narrator put all of the information into perspective for us.  "What would the Iceman think about all this scientific investigation? He wouldn't know what to make of it." Oh, that poor, primitive Iceman. What would he think if he knew his story were  paid for by people who sell pre-cubed cheese to his descendants? What would he think of descendants who couldn't kill their own bear let alone cube their own cheese? The Iceman would probably be glad he lived 5,200 years ago, free and capable. We gaze in wonder at how far we have come in 5,000 years. I have to wonder at how far we have fallen. If I needed to survive in the wilderness for a few days, I'd up and die from shock. I couldn't start a fire with sticks. I know there is more to it than that. Rest in peace, Iceman, you were as good as any of us.

      With the race for Omaha mayor heating up here in the final days, I have to say I am a little torn over the prospect that Hal Daub might be leaving the office of mayor. He sure has been good for Omaha hasn't he? Pundits might debate that, but one this is for sure: He loves that city like a mother loves its child and all he wants in return is some validation. He named his dog after you Omaha, the least you can do is reelect him. Hal Daub is to Omaha what Albert Speer was to German productivity. It's just too bad he has had such a bad opinion of his neighbors in Council Bluffs.  CB had enough self-esteem issues before Hal Daub. It was bad enough when we had to put up with "blue plate special" jokes from Joe Six-Pack Cornhusker, but to have that kind of disdain validated by a guy in a suit was unconscionable. Let's review.  Who can forget the Sin City comment? As if having a dirty bookstore and a couple of go-go clubs constitutes an X-rating. Apparently Mr. Daub never noticed the strip clubs on his own side of the river. Maybe Omaha go-go bars are the G-rated kind.  It is true that Nebraska does not have any adult bookstores, but that does not mean our neighbors do not have a taste for the product. Anyone who has cruised through the parking lot of the Adult Emporium parking lot would see quite a few Nebraska license plates. Who doesn't think back fondly on the proposed wheel tax? That was the one where Hal wanted hard-working Iowans who keep Omaha's economy rolling along to pay for the privilege. This idea had no one behind it, especially if they owned a business and counted on Iowans to get the job done. Was that not the kind of thing the South African government did during Apartheid?  Remember when high-powered bullets from the Omaha Police Department firing range were making their way through houses in Council Bluffs? Remember the heartfelt apology? Me neither come to think of it. Remember when the city of Omaha put up construction signs blocking access across the river from Douglas St.? The feds had to come in and tell the city of Omaha they couldn't cut off access to the interstate when they were so clearly not doing any kind of construction. That was sophisticated. It was probably just a coincidence this happened the same time the casinos opened.  Daub has been tough on crime like Batman. I'm surprised he didn't have a Hal signal installed on top of Woodman. His approach to crime was a little linear and according to critics he let Omahas neighborhoods fall to the wayside. That is debatable as most political charges are, but addressing symptoms of a problem is easier than fixing the problem itself. You can fight crime, you can't fight economic instability and a crumbling infrastructure - it just isn't as dramatic. Many in Council Bluffs have been offended by his comments over the years  so why should we be torn over his departure? Because nothing got Council Bluffs on the warpath like having Hal Daub taking potshots at us from his side of the Missouri. When our own Mayor Tom Hanafan got into with Daub, I was so proud I could pop. Mayor Hanafan earned my vote for life at that time and when I see him walking down the street or kicking back at Pizza King, I say hi, but I fight the urge to shout "give 'em hell, Tom!"  Nothing gave Iowans as much satisfaction as listening to Hal Daub criticize our casinos while watching Nebraskans roll into Harvey's, Ameristar and Bluffs Run to lay down the rent money for the off-chance of a big score. Nebraskans and other tourists were flooding across the river like the cure for cancer was over here and they still are. The only thing sweeter was watching the state of Nebraska consider and refuse to open up gambling in Nebraska.  Council Bluffs is a great town, casinos, strip clubs, bookstores and all. We work hard and we play hard. We keep pretty low profiles as a people. We are by nature humble. At the end of the day, when we come home to relax and find our neighbor attacking us in the Omaha-based television news, it begs the question: "What did we do to deserve such attacks?" An answer will not likely show itself and perhaps we should merely accept that when people are insecure, they look for someone to kick. That's fine, we can take it. Because if we learned anything from the Cold War, it is that nothing motivates you to achieve like having an enemy that hates you. While most in Council Bluffs  don't think of Omaha as an enemy, Hal Daub has made it clear during his tenure he thinks of us as one. So no offense to Mr. Fahey, he might well be the better choice for Omaha, but Hal Daub and his cutting remarks are better for Council Bluffs.

      Introductions are in order before we dive in. Like so many other people, I was born in Council Bluffs - a fact that  impresses none too many, but which is nonetheless true.  I was mostly raised here. I grew up in Crescent, went to Kirn then A.L. and  found little obstacle to attending Iowa State University (the one in Ames) for the better part of a decade. I found direction, meaning and friendship at the Iowa State Daily where I honed my journalism skills for a good three years. I am irretrievably and unashamedly working class, though my parents might be surprised at that since I spent so much time trying not to be. One day in college it dawned on me while reading Mark Twain that it was possible to be working class and a writer with something to say at the same time.  My politics are not so much right or left as they are pragmatic. I put working people first and advocate that if Council Bluffs is ever to step out of the funk it has been in since General Dodge sent the railroad across the river, we must be proud of what we really are and not in the pie-in-the-sky notions of what we might become one day if we can get the money together. I am a post-modern product of pop culture. I draw ideas from a variety of sources. Rainy days and Mondays always get me down. A hot dog makes me lose control. I have yet to find out what good kohlrabi is. If you know this or something else I might find useful, e-mail me at gjerrett@nonpareilonline.com.  So let's get started with the basics and what could be more basic than water. After a recent trip to the Council Bluffs Water Works to do a story on the annual skunky smell of the water, I was shocked - shocked at how clean the place is. Not  passably clean, but clean the way you think of God's house as clean. You could eat off their gleaming water-monitoring equipment. After a little research, I discovered that funky tap water is even better for you than bottled water. The nasty taste meant our water was clean. Spring runoff puts excessive organic waste in the Missouri and the extra chlorine cancels that out. The taste is a harmless side effect because the chlorine disappears as well. I urge all to drink and enjoy city water. More imporantly, I encourage you to renounce those expensive bottled waters. Here is why. Evian spelled backwards is naive and if you think this is a coincidence, go to Ville d'Evian, France and watch them bilking the tourists. Ironically, Evian may be the most valid exception to the bottled water scam. At least it comes from a hip spring in France. The average bottled water comes with no real guarantee of purity or health benefit because the industry is not closely regulated. But let's face it, the average hipster who shells out cash to sip water from a clever package is doing it more for the bottle than the water. How many people investigate their bottled water choices? They buy Dasani and Aquafina and never realize they are Coke and Pepsi products. Why add sugar and color to water when you can just bottle the water for your cut of the market? More and more people get on the bottled-water band wagon every year, increasing the size of this market. The bigger the market gets, the more brands of bottled water come out and the more people think there must be some real need to drink bottled water - a vicious cycle. A recent survey from the National Resources Defense Council on drinking water showed 60 to 70 percent of the bottled water in the United States does not have to conform to any FDA guidelines because it is bottled and sold within one state. Do you think the bottled water companies are unaware of this? The study (www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/nbw.aspexamined) examined 1,000 bottles of 103 brands and found that most of the water was of high quality, but one-third of the brands were contaminated. Not one or two brands, ONE-THIRD.  One out of three contained some level of actual, true-to-life contaminants: synthetic organic chemicals, bacteria and arsenic. Considering you are paying for purity, any amount is too much, right? One sample actually exceeded legal limits. Only one source of water is tested under standards more rigorous than those observed by most bottled water companies: Your city water supply. Your city hires people whose job it is to be accountable. They aren't in it for profit. When it comes to bacteria, cities test water hundreds of times per month compared to once per week for bottled water.  Cities test for synthetic and organic chemicals four times a year compared to bottled water's one whole time a year. And when it comes to testing for e. coli, fecal coliform, cryptosporidium, giardia and viruses, you can count bottled water out completely. There is this assumption that bottled water is unusually clean and no evidence for it. One particularly nasty brand labeled simply "Spring Water" actually came from an industrial parking lot next to a hazardous waste site. No one is really making sure you aren't swallowing the worst swill in the world from those clever, new age bottles that contain tap water 25 to 40 percent of the time . So drink from the fountain, America. Not only can you save money, you can save your health.

           'I'm doing it for the children ... really,' says man  FREDERICK, Md – Simon Webb, 356 Crabcake Ln. #B, shaved the last six strands of his hair friday deciding that he it needed to be done for the good of sick children. Webb donated the 10 inch strands to Locks of Love, a charitable organization that makes wigs for sick, bald children.   "I thought if I am going to take this drastic step, you know, actually shave myself bald, bald for the first time in me life and make this great big vastly different lifestyle choice that is so very much the opposite of what I used to look like then as a good Christian, I had better #uckin' do it for the kids, yeah? I mean, it stands to reason, right? Some little girl is going to have a magnificent wig is all I've got to say." "He really didn't have much to make a wig FROM," said Julie Darter, president and founder of Locks of Love. "He insisted that he would donate his 'glorious mane to needy orphan children.' It was kind of creepy because while the 'lock' of hair WAS 10 inches long, it was still barely visible to the naked eye. It was like a little red rubber band all twisted up with a little hair in it. It was the most effed up thing I've ever seen." With a single gleaming tear in his eye, Webb handed over his Lock of Love to Garter who accepted it in a public ceremony at Crowne Point Mall.  "I figured if I didn't accept it, he would keep tring to give it to me and I just wanted this whole thing to be over with as soon as possible," Darter said.  "Does this look like I might have hair if I let it grow out, d'ya'reckon," Webb asked onlookers."I mean, I know I've got no hair and YOU know I've got no hair, but do you think the birds will notice?"

      I found out last week that Dennis Miller, the bon mot-spouting pragmatist of "Dennis Miller Live," formerly of "Saturday Night Live's" Weekend Update fame, is getting the axe from HBO. I gotta tell you, this is a world-class bummer for me. Every writer can tell you who inspired them to do what they do and I'm not shy about the list of muckraking scribes I call influences, but I have not done enough to put Dennis Miller on that list. Primarily, I think of him as a comedian and while he has books to his credit, most of them are transcripts of his televised rants from "Dennis Miller Live."  When I started writing columns in college, it was with a copy of "Rants" and "Ranting Again" right by my side and if I had to do it all over again, the only thing I would change would be to add "I Rant, Therefore I Am" and "The Rant Zone" to that stack. I have not subscribed to HBO once in the nine season run of "Dennis Miller Live." Luckily, I have always been able to catch up online, at a friend's house or by catching the audio-only version on scrambled HBO channels. It's just that good. Miller has a cadence and rhythm that are surpassed only by his arcane references, practical politics and hardcore style of diatribe. He is the perfect American social commentator in my humble opinion. He is caustic, intelligent, vulgar, self-deprecating, honest and only just this side of aging hipster. He changes his position, admits when he screws up and sees life's details with magnificent clarity translating complex issues for a wider audience. I trust a guy like Miller because when he does a commercial for 10-10-220, shills for HBO, gets canned from "Monday Night Football" or does a movie that tanks, he has no problem pointing the finger squarely at his own chest while calling himself a prostitute, a hack, an egotist all while making better use of four-letter words than the TV Guide crossword puzzle. When he opened last week's show only a few days after being nixed from HBO and a few months after being dropped from "Monday Night Football," Miller said, "How many jobs can a guy %#$@!%& lose in one year?" breaking the tension before going on to rant about corporate and personal responsibility. What style. My early columns were practically an homage to Dennis Miller and while I will always have that taint, today I thought I would break out an old-school, Miller-esque tirade in honor of the man I hope will always be able to espouse his views in some forum. Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but if any country at any time ever needed outspoken social critics it is the United States at the start of the 21st century. American political discourse today has about as much meat in it as Harrah's Buffet after a visit by the three tenors, Louie Anderson and Gorak the Carnivore of Meatus IX. Dissension, competition and debate, once the foundations of  American democracy have taken more hits than a drunken sorority girl on Ladies Night at the Virginia Military Institute. Our country was founded on certain principles: freedom of religion, the pursuit of happiness, the right to own property, one man one vote and that what the Indians didn't know couldn't hurt us. But freedom of the press, the right to assemble and the need for dissent have become about as popular as Jerry Falwell at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch. No one needs to take away Americans rights to say what they want because the sad fact is that we are sheep that like to be shorn. At no time in our history has that been more obvious than after 9/11. Americans lined up to hand over their rights to individual thought so fast even a few reactionary demagogues were shocked and appalled. After decades of main stream America shutting down and tuning out vocal minorities like the Peace Movement, Civil Rights Movement, Animal Rights, Free Tibet, Free Quebec and people who prefer non-dairy creamer to half and half, discourse and opinion are doing about as well as Keith Richard's liver at the V.I.P. tent at Oktoberfest. Will Rogers, Woody Guthrie and Mark Twain used to rile people up and Americans liked it. Today, we like our controversy subdued and our scandals in neat, little sound bites so we can easily digest them. Newspaper readership is sinking faster than the Edmund Fitzgerald and even hard news magazines are adopting a more "reader friendly" format which is code for fewer words, bigger print and more pictures of half naked celebrities. We should learn to love debate again, mis amigos invisibles, because disagreeing with everybody is as American as apple pie in the hands of female body builder with a bald eagle tattoo playing baseball in a red, white and blue bikini singing "Born in the U.S.A." as she slides into home plate. If that's what you think. Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Dennis Miller still rules. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      While you're barbecuing and enjoying the last three-day weekend of the summer that Labor Day is all about the struggles and triumphs of the working men and women of the United States who put their backs into it, build things, move things and keep America on top.  Listen to some Woody Guthrie or at least some Bruce Springsteen, read "The Jungle" or "The Grapes of Wrath," maybe rent "Norma Rae" or "Matewan." Then lift a glass to people who made sure the average American doesn't have live like an indentured servant and maybe lift one for yourself too. I know you will.  *****  And now for you Labor Day weekend entertainment. A story of one working man's search for glory based VERY loosely on read events that occurred last Tuesday night in Omaha  The following news story is a parable. It is also satirical, which means it tells a greater truth than the facts allow for i.e. the thing is made up. Now that all our legal bases are covered ...  Growing old is a pain, a fact to which the "hero" of this story can testify. It also teaches other great working class lessons such as "never let your mouth write a check the other end of you can't cash." "Never talk yourself into believing you are tougher than you really are" and "just because they sell it, doesn't mean you have to drink it." Read on.   OMAHA, Neb. - Kevin "The Rasmanian Devil" Rasmussen, 34, of Council Bluffs was beaten into submission Tuesday night during an exhibition of Omaha Fight Club held at Club Amnesia in Omaha. Amateur fighters and members of the audience "faced off" in submission wrestling, kick boxing and no-holds-barred brawling for the entertainment of patrons. Fights lasted up to three rounds or nine minutes. Rasmussen's fight lasted for two minutes and three seconds and was the second longest fight of the evening. Going into the fight, Rasmussen said he had certain reservations about his chances for victory against his opponent, a much younger, leaner man. "Going in, I knew I was gonna get my butt kicked," said Rasmussen, who thanked God profusely for allowing him to "survive at all" his match with four-time national college wrestling champion Rob "Choir Boy" Van Garcia, 22, of Hogswallow, Vermont. Olsen registered a complete lack of surprise at his win, but did say his opponent was much "wilier and harder to pin down" than he anticipated. "He kept running away, but it was still pretty much over before it started," said Olsen as he wiped Rasmussen's blood and tears from his wrestling shoes. "I took one look at this old guy and I reckoned I had him. Then I saw him smoke about a pack and half of Kools while talking to some fat guy and a couple ring girls. It was at that point I was just hoping I wouldn't accidentally kill him. There is nothing more embarrassing than to have an opponent stroke out while you have him in a full nelson. Oh and he made me promise to tell everybody he looked good getting beat, can I say that here?" Greg Jerrett, 23, of Council Bluffs was Rasmussen's ring manager. Jerrett said he had "no fears at all" going into the match that Rasmussen was going to lose. "I had no fears at all that Kevin was going to lose," Jerrett said. "I was absolutely certain he would lose, it was just a question of how fast and how bad. I'm just glad the other guy didn't get hurt when he was kicking Kevin in the ribs. He could have easily stubbed. Luckily, Rasmussen is soft. Poor Kevin, I mean, I threw the towel in kinda fast. I almost hit him with it. That terry cloth was kinda rough, no fabric softener or anything. He could have been killed! Oh, but he looked good getting his butt kicked. Is that OK, Kev?" During the match, Rasmussen was visibly angered by the way in which Jerrett threw in the towel. "I told Jerrett to throw in the towel at the FIRST sign I was going to lose, not wait to see how many times this wrestler could pick me up and drop me on my head," Rasmussen said with a boldness he lacked IN the ring. Wiping a tear from his good eye, Rasmussen said, "I could have really gotten hurt! Yumpin' yiminy, didn't he see me tapping out? TAP TAP TAP! I almost broke my fingers on the mat!"  Rasmussen then began writing furiously into a folder to make sure his Dungeons and Dragons character "got the experience points for this one." Jerrett said he would have thrown in the towel sooner had the nachos he ordered for himself and the ring girls not arrived. "Bad timing on my part, but to be fair to me, I didn't realize he was tapping out, I thought he was convulsing," said Jerrett wiping cheese from his fingers and placing them back on the ring girl. "I guess I was focused on those nachos. They were very good nachos. I can't be expected to pay attention EVERY time Kevin Rasmussen gets beat in a fight. I'm only human. I paid attention the first 30 or 40 times I saw it, but after that, well ... you've seen it, you know what I mean." Rasmussen swore vengeance loudly before the crowd of nearly two dozen Nebraskans for the embarrassing public beating he received. "If it is the last thing I do, I will have my revenge for this," Rasmussen said as Life Flight paramedics restrained him for take off. "Do you hear me, Jerrett? I will get you for this!" Rasmussen is listed in stable condition though doctors say he will be unable to wear hats for some time. Jerrett is currently hiding at an undisclosed location in the hills of Crescent. He communicates using only smoke signals, courier pigeons and a Nokia 5800 series cell phone so he can reassure Rasmussen almost daily that even though he had his butt kicked, he "looked good any way."  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Ah, romance. Romance is one of those things you never really have to have, like cheese, but it just makes everything it touches so much better ... like cheese. My buddy, Pete, is one of those great catches, smart, good-looking, independently wealthy. Like most guys, he's about as thoughtless as a tzitzi fly when it comes to the ladies. Luckily for Pete, he's already married and so has no need for romance. Or so he thinks. I called Pete the other day and got to talking about what he was doing for his ninth wedding anniversary. Nothing, he says, probably stay home. You're kidding me, I says to him I say, you think that is not a one-way trip to distaster? Operating under the delusion that because his wife SAID she didn't want to do anything for their anniversary, Pete took that to mean that she actually MEANT she didn't want to do anything for their anniversary. Like I said, Pete is an intelligent guy, but he lacks the kind of street smarts to really keep a marriage in fine tune .  Luckily, he has me to make stuff up. I don't need any more women any closer to me than the ones I have now, so it is nice to play Cyrano de Bergerac occasionally. Some guys play fantasy baseball; I can sit back and watch how someone else's love life works under my guidance without all the fuss and extra cleaning associated with human contact. Romance isn't just what you do to woo a woman. Romance isn't just about love and seduction. The term "romance" actually applies to an entire category of medieval tales based on legend, chivalric love and adventure. King Arthur is a prime example. Romance tales were fantasies dealing with heroism and the mysterious, they lacked a certain basis in fact. Which is why, years later, the term has been narrowed by common usage to refer almost exclusively to the flowers and candy maneuvering men do to make women feel extra special.  Of course, modern romance is not supposed to just be some underhanded ploy to deceive the ladies, at least not so far as the ladies are concerned, it's supposed to be a genuine outpouring of uncontrollable affection that makes men act in a fashion that is counter to their base nature. "You complete me," "You make me want to be a better man," "Without you I am lost," "You clean my socks like it ain't nobody's business, baby," things like that.  In most tales of medieval fancy, romance was about killing dragons and kicking dude's butts then going off to pick daisies for some chick. They had no TV, radio or magazines so they had to do something to kill time. Occasionally, they killed each other to kill time. Some dude tried to kick my butt the other day to look cool in front of his "lady." He gave me the time-honored Council Bluffs signal that he wanted to engage in fisticuffs, namely, he took off his shirt to show me his flabby gut and complete lack of hair.  Guys with no body hair just aren't scary, they're like  furless Mexican cats, featherless Israeli chickens or N'Sync, an aberration of nature pleasing to young girls who want to keep them as pets, but hardly frightening. I dispatched him readily enough with the flat side of my longsword whilst his girlfriend didst hold my jacket. I dig romance. I am quite the romantic. Actually, I am quite the disappointed romantic, which means my card is officially stamped "cynic," but life is still a little more interesting with the proper amount of fantasy added to the mix. Fantasy/romance is why we flirt with people who are WAY too good-looking to condone interfering with us physically in the first place. It's why we get dressed up to go out for a night of fancy living. It's why middle-aged men drive Corvettes and why no woman on the planet wears a shoe larger than 6 or 7 unless it's the store's fault. Half the time, it's what gets us out of bed in the morning knowing that after a day of pretending everyone we work with doesn't hate us, we can spend the night at a watering hole pretending people there do more than barely tolerate us. It's why we nose dive into a book or try to reach level 10 in some electronic reality.  Fantasy is self-medication for the soul. Losing yourself in your own diversions passes the time, but making someone else's fantasies real, well that's just pure altruism. It's also vicarious living - another kind of fantasy. So I told Pete that if he didn't want to spend the next two months wondering why his wife was mad at him, he better make some kind of effort, preferably in public, to demonstrate that he still goes weak in the knees whenever he thinks about the mother of his children.  I recommended a pizza delivered to the office that said "you rock!" in pepperoni followed 15 minutes later by flowers  with a card that said "Just kidding - I love you, baby." Pete opted out of the pie and went for an arrangement so huge they had their own ecosystem and a bottle of cold duck. Six of one, half dozen of the other, I suppose.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      So last Thursday, six Supreme Court justices out of nine made the call that executing mentally retarded individuals  - generally regarded as those with I.Q.s of 70 or lower - might be cruel and unusual (thus violating the Eighth Amendment) and should be put on hold. As a unit, the court tends to believe the death penalty is not in and of itself cruel or unusual. So let's go with that.  O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, Bader Ginsburg, Breyer and Stevens said "we are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty." Scalia, Thomas and Rehnquist were so outraged at this decision that their rebuttal - called scathing and scoffing - said: "If one is to say as the court does today that ALL executions of the mentally retarded are so morally repugnant as to violate our national standards of decency, surely the consensus it points to must be one that has set its righteous face against ALL such executions."  In short, they are saying the other six are obviously yet secretly opposed to the death penalty and must be soft-on-crime pinkos. Scalia refused to sign the dissent "respectfully dissenting" to let everyone know they meant business. Scalia mocked what he referred to as the "the 47 percent consensus" pointing out that only 18 states of the 38 allowing capital punishment don't execute the retarded and that is way less than half.  I would suggest it is safe to say the 12 states that don't allow capital punishment at all could legitimately and safely be counted with the 18 bringing the consensus to 30 states against executing the retarded to 20 that allow it and may or may not like being referred to as "IN FAVOR of executing the retarded." Call me crazy, but I think that not executing retarded people is a good thing and is not the drawback to law and order critics suggest. "Now everybody that commits murder will claim to be retarded," is the rallying cry. Yeah, because we'll never see through that.  Have we gotten so hung up on payback that we just want to kill anyone and everyone that crosses the line regardless of their capacity to know right from wrong? At some point, it is important to establish that justice can be served short of death rather than seeking the most extreme punishment in as many cases as possible. Well, I'm with Dubya on this one, executing retarded folks is just plain wrong. The problem is that "justice" has become synonymous with "retribution" in America. It is time to maybe step back a pace and look at what the whole point of executing people is supposed to be. Regardless of your stance on capital punishment, whether you believe that no civilized nation should use death as a punishment, whether you think we should kill 'em all and let God figure out whose guilty or whether you think you could think of 20 things worse to do to a murderer than giving him the quick release of death, one thing seems pretty clear: if there is no chance of securing the public from future, similar crimes or of meaningfully punishing an individual in a way they and others like them are capable of understanding, then the punishment is not only unjust it runs the risk of making the public less secure. Example. In Henry VIII's England, capital crimes were extended to include highway robbery. The logic was this would curb highway robbery by scaring the robbers straight. What it did was jack up the murder rate as highway robbers began killing everyone they robbed to keep witnesses to a minimum.  In the current case, executing a retarded guy who may or may not appreciate his crime does little to teach him an important lesson about what it's like to be an upstanding member of society nor does it send a clear message to other retarded people to behave since the idea of clearly communicating concepts to retarded people is at the heart of the matter. What do they understand? Is it reasonable to expect someone with an I.Q. of 70 or less to always appreciate the consequences of their actions? Good and evil, that's the heart of the matter. We want to punish evil, keep it in line. Does everyone always know when they are being evil?  I appreciate that evil, if left unchecked, can spread like a virus. I also believe good people can be capable of evil and still be good. Continuing to check ourselves MAKES us good.  Good people who see nothing wrong with executing  retarded people might need to do a check, that's all I'm saying. People who stand around with frying pans shouting "burn, baby, burn" at executions have definitely crossed a line somewhere. Either that or their hometowns don't have cable. Before writing this column, I asked myself "what would Jesus do?" and funny enough Jesus wouldn't pull the switch on a retarded guy either so... safe for one more day I guess. Granted, the Eighth Amendment is a bit vague. "Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted." It doesn't say what cruel or unusual is because they either had a general understanding of "cruel and unusual" in December, 1791 when the Bill of Rights was adopted or they wanted to let successive generations decide for themselves. They didn't have electricity, I.Q. tests or psychiatrists in 1791 so they could not be expected to determine whether sending a charge through a retarded guy was cruel or unusual. Lucky for us, we have all of these things and should be able to either breathe a sigh of relief that something good has been done in a world full of badness or, at the very least, let it slide and respectfully dissent. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Time to circle the wagons, load your guns and hide the kids 'n' women folk, it's political litmus test time again.  Every summer, when the sun takes longer to set, the days are hot and humid and the reality TV shows are in full bloom, some issue or other rears its head to get everyone all het up. Wednesday, some guy (Michael Newdow) in the Wild West (Sacremento, Calif.) managed to stir up debate over the Pledge of Allegiance by getting the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to declare the current form of the Pledge unconstitutional - in particular, the part added in 1954 during the height of the Red Scare that says "under God."  Now, I suppose it is expected that all professional purveyors of opinion should be getting themselves worked up about this issue on one side or the other. For me, it's just too hot and what with the humidity turning my biscuits into dumplings, I flatly refuse to get worked up over this issue. Chances are it is just covering up for some other much more important scandal anyway that is now buried under a morass of media flurry as pundits debate and the man on the street gives his opinion in spite of the fact that the average man on the street has never voted in any election any where at any time more important than senior class president and even then he probably voted "straight party." I don't think anybody should be casually changing the Pledge of Allegiance from how it was written by a minister in 1892 who did not write it with "under God." That when the 1954 Congress took a statement of pure patriotism and added "under God" during the Red Scare to boost their own images in the eyes of a nation scared of communists. They messed with the Pledge and pretty much this brouhaha inevitable. Why it took until 2002 is the only thing that really surprises me. I would actually like to go back in time and undo everything that happened between 1945 and 1954. The United States would be much better off if we could have gone straight from kicking the hell out of the Nazis to Rock 'n' Roll, wouldn't we?  Unfortunately, we had the Red Scare in there to cast long shadows over our nation's integrity. Americans of all stripes were victimized by the ambitions of a few piggish men who ran this country ragged looking for communists, ruining careers and ultimately accomplishing nothing more than the destabilization of civil liberties by making them a privilege of the few instead of the right of all. You know, I give my allegiance to the United States, but I won't be saying any pledges any time soon with or without the phrase "under God" in them because I am flat offended at the notion that anybody else in this country thinks I need to live up to THEIR standard of patriotism. Pledges inherently contain the idea that there is someone saying it and someone listening to it, otherwise there would be little point in saying it at all unless one contends that saying a thing over and over again has the effect of ingraining that sentiment deeply into the subconscious.  Writing it is the same thing. You write it, for someone else to read. And who is that someone else? Tell me, exactly what other human being of United States citizenry do you hold in such high regard that you feel you must prove yourself to them? Who do you willingly turn your fate over to? By a man's actions, that's how you know him, not a few words he can recite. That's not proof. Even the Devil can quote Scripture if he needs to. My allegiance to the United States is not in question until somebody else tries establishing rules, tests and measures to sum up how patriotic I am in comparison to them. Take a minute right now and make a list of every person you know whose patriotism you honestly feel is superior to yours. Use whatever criteria you wish to make that determination. Are school teachers on that list? Principles? Employers? Cops? Firemen? Congressmen? Members of various branches of government? Servicemen? And of those people, how many are sworn to serve the public interest, the same public to which you and I belong? Even the President of the United States serves us so why should we prove ourselves to him? Simple fact of the matter is the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that "under God" is unconstitutional is just going to give everybody yet another chance to line up and beat their chests once again before the new fall lineup of TV shows starts and they realize they don't say the Pledge, haven't said it for decades and even if they did, it doesn't prove anything and that the Supreme Court will more than likely overturn the lower court ruling for a few kudos.  These things always heat up in the summer when there is nothing but re-runs, game shows and "reality" TV to distract us. Three summers ago, the flag-burning amendment was big news after nearly 10 years of dormancy even though no one saw anyone born in the United States burn a flag in person or on TV. Why? Somebody stirred up some stuff.  The extent to which the American public cares about any political issue is in direct inverse proportion to how many of us want to know what happens on tonight's episode of "Friends." Personally, I always thought Ross and Monica would get together. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      There is a meanness in the air today, I can feel it. It could just be me, but I doubt it. Just as the atmosphere of love and peace around the holidays demands our respect, so too does that ornery spirit some days take on. No time to bury one's head in the sand, but let's face it, sometimes it's nice to stay out of sight until the bad mojo passes. To do otherwise is foolhardy. Speaking of mean-spirited humors, ever watch these spots on "The Tonight Show" where Jay Leno asks people on the street or college campuses a few obvious questions like "who was Louis Armstrong?" Answers range from "the first man to walk on the moon" to "the king of France."  Jay rolls his eyes and we laugh at how stupid these people are. But last time I checked, Leno wasn't exactly the Noam Chomsky of Late Night talk show hosts - that honor went to Bob Costas years ago. Leno is still doing Bill Clinton jokes over a year after the fact. George Carlin he is not. Luckily the Robert Blake case came along so he could dust off those O.J. jokes, but I hear he has some good material on Teapot Dome and what a lard butt President Taft is. Leno is not doing "Nightline" and that's OK when Carrot Top is on to plug his latest failure, but when Dick Cheney shows up for a quick boost to his approval rating, I think we can do better than heart attack jokes, can't we? Commentary on the American intellect from a man whose show is almost as challenging as the TV Guide crossword puzzle does serve as a great example of the intellectual rift in American culture. We hate smart people as much as we hate dumb people. We don't trust people who come off too smart. What do they know they we don't? Why do they know things we don't? Who says what they know is better than what we know? Since Noam Chomsky is already on the table, a CNN interview with Chomsky, a professor of linguistics and prolific social critic, and William Bennett, former drug czar and co-founder of Empower America, this week served as a great demonstration for why this gulf exists. It's nurtured. These two discussed 9-11 and what it means. Bennett platitudes and perspectives typically rally us all in a patriotic fervor, while Chomsky and his book "9-11" are typically critical of American political policy, something akin to treason these days. No matter where one stands on the political spectrum or geopolitical affairs, it helps to take note when people like Bennett try to get a man like Chomsky dismissed out-of-hand because he is one of the dirtiest words going: an intellectual. Anyone watching would get the impression that intellectuals are inherently unpatriotic and while Chomsky does not aspire to patriotism, I would submit there is nothing inherently unpatriotic about being informed, asking questions, pointing the finger squarely at ourselves occasionally and correcting our course. Tell that to the powers that be. No, I would assert that knowing what is going on in the world, reading a book on complex subjects occasionally, keeping up with the news - understanding it not just staring at the spectacle of it all - is our patriotic duty.  Our forebears wanted public education because only in a country where the average person is educated can the sweet bud of democracy flourish. You cannot oust someone with your vote if you don't know who he is, what he stands for and what he has done while in office. I mean the boring stuff like how he voted not just how many interns he bedded or killed. Patriots come in many sizes and forms.  A patriot does not have to be a booster for his country 24-7 nor does a patriot have to support his country's government, foreign policy, wars, laws or popular mind set.  Thomas Jefferson would likely be arrested as a terrorist were he alive today, because he advocated violent revolution on a regular basis just to keep our elected leaders in line. Since he obviously had the gumption to make it happen once, there is no telling what he would get up to today. Of course, all of this gets spun in the retelling.  Chomsky's whole gig is about words ultimately. He understands language in a way most of us don't and aren't likely to any time soon, but words are at the heart of not just American politics, but politics as far back as politics go. It serves the ends of the powerful to keep us all ignorant and since most Americans are so put off by smart folks, the chances of the masses ever listening to well-heeled social critics with a point to make is so slim it makes Calista Flockhardt look like Mama Cass. It is our all-too-common pride of ignorance that is the real danger to America, but here is the first step to getting back on track. Listen to people you wouldn't normally, read people you're told to dismiss and trust no one - right, left or in-between - who tries to convince you it's your patriotic duty to keep the blinders on.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      For the graduating class of 2002, a few words of advice:   Don't use the word "ironic" when all you mean is "weird" or "coincidental." It's not ironic that you ran into your friends at the mall.  Only when the literal meaning is the opposite of the intended meaning or when a series of dramatic events results in circumstances that are incongruous with the expected outcome of those events is something "ironic." And dance. Dance like you haven't got a brain in your head ... unless people are watching, then act like you just tripped. Never support a Constitutional Amendment to make something illegal that isn't a problem in the first place. "Facetious" is not the same as "funny." You aren't being facetious when you tell a bad joke at a party, you are being facetious when you tell a bad joke at a funeral. Enjoy your body, but don't ever let anyone else enjoy it. There is no such thing as "a good touch," especially at a fraternity party Don't move to a big city to be cool. That doesn't work. Cool people are cool no matter where they live. Don't wait to be discovered. Instead, make a huge ass of yourself until people either dismiss you as annoying or accept you as bold. Vanilla Coke. It's Coke and vanilla. Don't get excited. If you THINK you might like sky-diving, you probably won't. If you KNOW you would like sky-diving, you definitely won't.  Why buy used when new smells so much better. Fashion is for pop culture victims. Never do anything just because everyone else is doing it. Don't think too much about being popular. Popular people don't. A simple box fan makes the voices in your head be quiet ... for a little while any way. When writing your manifesto, a shack in the woods is as good a place as any. It offers both privacy and mystique. Never believe that serious issues can only be addressed seriously. Comedy is the greatest weapon we have against tyranny. Don't hate people because they are different from you. Hate people because they are just like you. If a train leaves Lincoln heading east at 60 m.p.h. at the same time a car leaves Des Moines heading west at 75 m.p.h. does anyone really care how long it takes them to meet as long so long as they both stop and play the slots? Margarine is no damn good. Never put off until tomorrow what can be done today unless you are absolutely sure you can get away with it. Nobody knows the trouble you've seen if you don't tell them about it every chance you get. "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn" is the single greatest science fiction movie ever made right behind "Bladerunner," "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Soylent Green" and "Westworld." Travel as much as you can. See the world in all its glory because you never know how long it or you will be here. Cats are not smarter than dogs just because they poop in a box. The less a person has to say, the louder they are likely to say it. Listen more than you speak. Don't assume loud is right. That's how fascism gets rolling. You don't need all that sugar. Have a piece of fruit. And dance. Dance like your tip depends on it. Spanking ... ain't nothing wrong with that! "Made in America" means something again with no small thanks to the Japanese. Makes you think. Nine times out of 10, if you are the same but everyone else is different, you are in the Twilight Zone. Why run when you can walk? Why read when you can see the movie? Why cook when you can eat out? Why stand when you can sit? Why try when giving up is so easy? Don't be linear when you can work in circles. The greatest minds in history never did things the easy way. Tacos are supposed to be soft. That crispy shell thing is an abomination. Sometimes doing the right thing takes great effort. Sometimes doing the right thing takes no effort at all. Knowing when to act and when not to act is the key. Everything is better in moderation except for cheese.  Credit cards are the devil's plastic. Listen to college radio every chance you get. There is no such thing as a stupid question, just questions asked by stupid people. You cannot succeed if you do not try, but on the other hand you can't fail either. No one likes a whiner unless she is an extremely attractive woman, then no one seems to mind that much. Six of one, half dozen of the other. Being folksy is a good way to make people trust you. Being rich is a good way to make sure people do what you want whether they trust you or not. Never say "I love you" unless you really mean it or if someone says it to you first. You can always take it back later. And dance. Dance like a monkey with its tail on fire. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Going to war with Iraq is such a monumentally bad idea that I am suddenly left without the capacity for rational self expression. So I will just grunt and stamp for the length of this column in the hopes that my moral point of view or MPOV will spread via osmosis. Right now, we are on the "brink" of war. The brink of war is a funny place to sit, because this is the point historians look back and wonder what exactly we were all thinking we were about to do; what was going through our minds before X happened?  No one "wants" war. Even the people who really, really do want war so bad they can taste it like a big juicy burger will tell us they don't want it. They will tell us that war is one of those inevitable eventualities of life to which old men commit - if not condemn - young men. War is something required in the struggle of right vs. wrong, good vs. evil, the light side of the force vs. the dark side of the force. It never ends. And the truth is that some wars certainly are inevitable. I would even go so far as to say that as bad as war is, it can even be necessary.  But war with Iraq? Is it necessary or would it just feel good? War with Iraq is about as necessary as your typical bar brawl. The only reason to go at it with Iraq is to make us look cool in front of our girlfriends and buddies who had too many Jagermeisters. People will argue about the necessity of war from now until the moment it gets started and the Desert Storm II: Electric Boogalo T-shirts, hats and bumper stickers go on sale. At that point, the debate will cease, Dubya's ratings will skyrocket, people will talk about the amazing resurgence of patriotism and how great it is that we are all on the same page "at last." The problem is that Iraq is like one of those bullies you went to high school with. You know the guy, the one nobody liked who smoked weed during gym class. Everybody wanted to beat him up, but he had a lot of older cousins.  No one really likes Iraq including his cousins and while they would like to see him get a beat down they can't let it happen because moms would get mad.  Of course, at this point in history, it doesn't require 20/20 hindsight to know that Iraq is not so much the problem as the guy in charge, Saddam Hussein. The guy is a pathological freak and most Iraqis, like most Americans, would be happier without him. They are also like us in that they get up and go to work every day and just want to not be blown up on the way to the market one day. They would have taken care of this in 1991, too, if we hadn't pulled out leaving Saddam in power. A regime change is needed in Iraq and Saddam Hussein and a few cronies are about the only people who disagree with that statement. He destabilizes the Middle East more than it already is and even the Saudis would like see him gone, but they can't just give us the thumbs up, because they have an image to maintain. It's like taking taking sides against your family. Right now, we're the toughest kid on the block that everybody seems annoyed with. Even the guys we hang out with like England are telling us to "chill out 'cause the guy ain't worth it." But we really want to beat somebody up and we really want to make him swing first (casus belli-an event that justifies war). In this case, the casus belli is that Iraq might be in possession of weapons of mass destruction or harboring al-Qaida. Whatever gets the job done. We aren't sure, but we do know they keep looking at us funny, i.e. they want really badly to be in possession of said weapons so no one will mess with them.  Different experts say different things. One expert says Iraq doesn't have jack for weapons while others says they could have a working nuke by 2005. Either way, most everyone agrees Saddam Hussein is a loose cannon. Not so much like "Die Hard," but more like Charles Manson, the Son of Sam or Napoleon. This would all be much easier if we knew we had the support of anti-Hussein forces in Iraq, but unfortunately they haven't known what to make of us since 1991 when we pulled out and left them on their own - a curious move to say the least. This would all be a tad less difficult with the support of Arab countries in the region. This would almost be a no-brainer if a few of our allies were down with us, but they aren't. What we do have is a slim possibility for a peaceful solution, but even that might just end up being a "prelude" to war. Vigorous weapons inspection backed by military force. No firing, just huge threats. We go in no holds barred, no shenanigans, no spontaneous civilian protests ... nothing. No rock left unturned, no door left locked, no falafel left untested for small pox and THEN maybe we can avoid a 10-year commitment and possible worldwide immolation. Perhaps with Saddam totally controlled, meaningful change in Iraq will be possible without war. It is quite an investment, but then peace, usually is.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      New York's Mayor Mike Bloomberg has managed to get the price of cigarettes jacked up to $7.50 PER PACK. Can you believe it? Remember when you could get cancer sticks for a buck? From a vending machine? At work? So you could smoke WHILE you worked? I bet you do.  Nothing said good morning, America like that first smoke as you rolled out of bed, shaved, showered, had another smoke, poured a cup of coffee, smoked a cigarette and then headed off to the bomber plant to do your part for the war effort ... while smoking.  Time was, any 12-year-old with a notion to could walk into the general store, get a handful of jaw breakers and a carton of Lucky Strikes for a penny. And why not? If you're old enough to work 14 hours a day, by God you should be old enough to smoke, too. Soon, Bloomberg will manage to make it illegal to smoke even in New York bars. Can you imagine walking into a transvestite, S&M, biker bar on branding night and not being able to smoke? Me neither. Lots of people, well, not people so much as smokers, don't like that one bit. "It's a violation of our civil rights," they shout while frantically reaching for another bullet and one of those tacky, red disposable, child-proof lighters they bought at a convenience store for 50 cents that barely works. Flick, flick, flick. Flick ... flick ... FLICK. "I have rights, too, you know." Puff ... fuuuuuu. I have to agree with the sentiment behind those words. It really isn't a bar if people aren't smoking in it. One can hardly argue that a bar is such a healthy environment that it is wrong to poison other people's lungs while those people are poisoning their livers. Besides, smoking and drinking go together like Martin and Lewis, Lewis & Clark, Lois and Clark and Clark Bars and Vodka which leads us back to smoking and drinking. Why should what goes on New York concern those of us who live in the rational epicenter of common sense and libertarianism that is the Midwest? Because what New York does, we'll be doing six months after that. If the largest city in our country pulls off this coup with little or no rankle, then the motivation will be there for every city and state government to drop the hammer on smoking as well. Ames already has a ban in restaurants before 8:30 p.m. and Iowa City is working on one, too. More and more people are warming to the idea of simply outlawing cigarettes altogether, a feat that is looking more plausible every day. Smoking is going the way of the dodo and one day in our "Star Trek" future we will look back in wonder at this primitive behavior. Smoking tobacco is not significantly different than smoking crack or shooting heroin. In fact, studies have shown that cigarettes are at least as addictive as cocaine. Don't believe me? Try quitting. People can say they like smoking all they want, but the sad fact is they are just as addicted to that drug as any back alley dope fiend. If you had a monkey on your back digging his nails into your neck until you fed him bananas, would that mean you really liked bananas? Of course not. You were just feeding the monkey. Remember the first time you inhaled smoke? That is how you really feel about cigarettes. When you wake up because you are having a "nic fit," those are the same feelings junkies get when they need to spike a vein. The reason smokers so often look like death warmed over is no more complicated than why crackheads, tweekers and dopers look like hell. Poison will do that to you. Smokers get upset at smoking bans because they are hooked on a drug. I got hooked at 18 and even though I don't want to smoke today, I like the idea of going into a bar, having a beer and stepping off the wagon.  When I got the diabetes, my doctor said give up cheese and never smoke again. OK, I said. Now, let's get something straight. I love cheese. For six months, I had no cheese and not one smoke. Then I went to the airport. After a stressful check-in, I hit the bar and found a mark to bum me just one smoke.  Nearly a year later, I have not so much as bought a small quantity of cheddar cheese unless it was fat free and taste free, but I still buy smokes from my co-workers on a regular basis.  One day, the world will look upon tobacco with at least as much disdain as it views marijuana, not because all the non-smokers will make the lives of smokers miserable, but because EX-smokers, high on zealotry, will call for its ban to keep temptation at bay. Smoking is not pleasurable, it is not relaxing, it doesn't feel good, smoke doesn't taste refreshing. Smoking is a drug and smokers are drug users. As long as people are comfortable with that notion, so be it. With that said, public interference should really be kept to a minimum. Smoking will die on its own the less we do. In-your-face measures will act as life support. Stop Big Tobacco from selling to kids, keep the ads down, but leave the smoking sections alone and quit jacking with the prices. The only thing legislators and city councils will manage to do is make smoking even cooler than it already is. That's half the reason people started anyway.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Since the dawn of history, mankind has run in gangs of one kind or another. Any excuse to draw distinctions between us and them. Tribes, clans, nations and within, nations, political parties. It's part of our human need to identify ourselves with a greater entity for protection. Parties are a big part of the problem with our current system of government. Instead of spending time debating issues on their merit, finding practical solutions for modern living and getting something, anything done, we waste what little political effort we are willing to make on defending our parties of choice. Right now we have a two-party system that takes money from the same corporate sponsors in an effort to keep things as homogeneous as possible. Straying too far from the pack is a death sentence.  These parties don't matter. The Republican Party hasn't done anything truly great since Lincoln freed the slaves and the Democratic Party should have folded up shop the second Bobby Kennedy was shot. Two-party mud-slinging is all we really have. We might just as well go back to the Whig and Bull Moose parties, at least their names put things in perspective. Who could get seriously worked up about being a member of these parties? "Whigs rule!" "I'm a proud Bull Moose." Of course, you are. Lord knows Hitler would never have gotten as far as he did if the National Socialist German Worker's Party had been called Dolfie und die Apfelstrudel MiststÃ¼cken. It's all about image, substance got lost in the shuffle so long ago even its mother has moved on. The purpose of any political parties, first and foremost, is to consolidate power. Sure, most of them start out with the best intentions, namely, to shift power from someone else who is hording it. Political movements start out seeking change and turn into political parties that want to maintain the status quo. The parties have sought power for so long they forgot what they wanted the power for in the first place. Under the best of circumstances, a party needs a simple majority to take charge. A mandate from the people, control of the executive and legislative branches is needed to make any real progress, but when that happens, the party in charge is so worried about maintaining their control they soft pedal themselves out of office because the people generally believe it isn't good to have one party with too much power. So what is the point to parties? No one has even gotten it all and proved that yes, indeed, they were right all along. They won't it isn't possible.  Right now, the two major American political parties have things evenly divided between them. We can argue and quibble over who has a slight lead at any given time and believe me, we DO and WILL argue about who squeaks by with a few heads as if a few thousand one way or the other in a country of over 200 million people matters much. Debating about whose gang is bigger and badder is ultimately pointless because in 25, 50 or 100 years there could be two other parties vying for the same mandate from the same people who don't see that our system doesn't care about who is right and who is wrong so much as who can get what from whom and how fast. What are we, Bloods and Crips? Basically ... yes. Reds vs. blues. Republicans vs. Democrats. You could meet people all the time who agree with you on a vast majority of issues who just have to know what political party you belong to so they can know whether or not it's OK to agree with you or dismiss you out of hand.  Does it really matter if your produce manager is a liberal or conservative? A Republican or Democrat? He could be SLA, Quebec LiberteÂ´ or a boy from Brazil so long as he keeps the cabbage stocked, what do we care? City politics are the same thing. Who cares what party a city mayor votes in national elections? That has nothing to do with maintaining the streets, sewers and tourist industry.  I myself can say 1+1=2 time and time again and it doesn't matter how sound the logic is, somebody still wants to know how I'm registered before they buy into my line of reasoning ... such as it is. Why does that matter? Is it OK for me to say spanking is OK as long as I'm a Republican? Is it suddenly wrong if I'm a Democrat who says the same thing?  I am fiercely independent and will remain so. I vote the issues and the candidate, never straight party. I encourage you to do the same. We don't need term limits because voting is all the limitation we should need. If a professional politician is good, he should stay in office for as long as we keep pulling the lever by his name. If he stinks, we should vote him out. If you want political change, drop out of the two-party rut, because honestly, when was the last time you were even invited to the party? Thank you, thank you very much.

      I was watching a documentary about the Iceman, a guy who fell asleep on a snow-covered mountain in Europe some 5,200 years ago only to be thawed out in the 20th Century. To answer your question, no, he wasn't still alive. He did have a few lessons for us though. Scientists picked him apart from top to bottom... literally. This man's colon told a story like "War and Peace."  As far as documentaries go, it was pretty sweet. It had dramatic reenactments of life in 3200 B.C. and believe me, life back then was not pretty and slick like it is today.  Iceman was something of a stud and he told these scientists a great deal For example, he had a copper axe 1,000 years before it was thought possible to have copper. That's like finding a TV in the Dark Ages or strong leadership in the Democratic Party. Amazing! Iceman was decked out in his finest goin'-to-the-sacred-tree clothes. Before this, no one had a clue what Neolithic men wore. Apparently they wore animal skins and not polyester, but hey, the man had a copper axe so anything is possible. The Iceman - let's call him Brian - was 45. That is old for a Neolithic man. Three times before he died, Brian's fingernails stopped growing. This is significant because one's fingernails only stop growing when one is suffering a severe illness. THIS is significant because it means Brian was sick enough to die three times and DIDN'T. THAT is significant because Brian either had access to medicinal herbs or the European healthcare system is just that good. My money is on echinacea. That stuff works! Wear on Brian's teeth showed he ate a rough bread product. Fascinating. The commercials were almost as educational as the documentary itself. One was for Chili and Scoops - corn chip scoops with a tiny bowl of chili in a plastic container inside a brightly painted cardboard box. Microwave the chili, eat it with the scoops - it's fun! I bet the Brian would be miffed he missed this one. Why would anyone pay for a single serving of chili and a handful of corn chips? Our Neolithic ancestors killed bears for dinner and we can't get it together enough to buy our own can of chili and bag of chips? Then there was one for Kraft cheese cubes. Just cubes of cheddar cheese in a bag. As if cheese weren't expensive enough, I am going to pay someone else to cube it? Recipe for cubed cheese: 1) Buy cheese. 2) Cube it! If you can't do that, you should avoid cheese anyway. If you have money to spend on pre-cubed cheese and never give to charity, you might want to rethink this in case Jesus is watching. And Lunchables, aren't these pretty much crackers and cheese in a box? When I was a kid, if you sent your kid to school with nothing but crackers and cheese, the teacher called social services.  Are they still selling the single-serving cereal bowls in the refrigerated section with the milk? They sell these things so kids can help themselves, but if a kid can't  open a box of cereal how can one crack three layers of cardboard and safety seals to get at a couple ounces of Frosted Flakes? If your kids aren't old enough to figure out a box of cereal, they shouldn't be in the kitchen by themselves. Besides, what kid can't polish off three bowls of sugar-coated anything while watching cartoons? Maybe it started with canned soup, sliced bread and TV dinners. Was that the beginning of the end of self-reliance in America? Or maybe it goes back to the beginning of agrarian society itself. We accept a lot of waste in America: Cans, plastic, aluminum, Robert Downey Jr. episodes of "Ally McBeal," but even so, these products go beyond the pale. Small units increase your cost per unit so where is the up side? I've got to think there is psychological damage as well. Consuming these prepackaged food items is a weird placebo telling us falsely we are better than lesser men. I waste, therefore I am. I am not completely above all this, no one is. Maybe my objection is a working-class thing. When I was a kid, my mom would rather have cut her hands off than buy tiny bags of chips. "Why would I want to spend good money on little bags of chips when we got a whole bag in the cupboard?"  I couldn't believe she didn't get it. Didn't she know chips taste better when they come in designer bags for others to see you have enough money to spend on shiny things? Maybe cheese tastes better when somebody else cubes it, too. Who knows? Not me, because I would never buy pre-cubed cheese. At the end of the Brian's documentary, the narrator put all of the information into perspective for us.  "What would the Iceman (Brian) think about all this scientific investigation? He wouldn't know what to make of it." Oh, that poor, primitive Iceman. What would he think if he knew his story were  paid for by people who sell pre-cubed cheese to his descendants? What would he think of descendants who couldn't kill their own bears let alone cube their own cheese? The Iceman would probably be glad he lived 5,200 years ago, free and capable. We gaze in wonder at how far we have come in 5,000 years. I have to wonder at how far we have fallen. If I needed to survive in the wilderness for a few days, I'd up and die from shock. I couldn't start a fire with sticks. I know there is more to it than that. Rest in peace, Iceman, you were as good as any of us.

      There is a homework assignment at the end of today's column. Don't worry, it involves watching TV not doing calculus. A British marketing firm working for video game manufacturer Acclaim UK is looking for people who will legally change their identities to that of one of their most popular characters, Turok, a time-travelling American Indian who hunts bionically-enhanced dinosaurs. I know what you're thinking: where is a pre-contact Indian supposed to get a time machine and why would he kill dinosaurs bionic or otherwise? The process is called identity marketing and is just the latest abomination to come out of the minds and wallets of marketing folk who act more and more like characters from Revelations every day. How it works is you go online and apply. You have to be willing to not just change your name legally to "Turok" for one year, you have to be willing to live your life as a walking talking advertisement for the game. Dress like Turok, talk like Turok. Kill bionic dinosaurs should they show up at your place of work.  Oh, you can keep your job at McDonald's. Mickey Ds would probably be obligated to keep you on the payroll too. As an equal opportunity employer, it would be illegal for them to fire an employee just because he is a time-traveling Indian who kills bionic dinosaurs. That's in the Constitution presumably. You will need to keep your day job as well because in exchange for abandon your true identity for a year, you will make a whopping $800, according to the Associated Press. Well, NEARLY $800. Apparently making an enormous jackass out of yourself for an entire year is only worth about $785 ... before taxes. Why such a silly ploy to promote a video game? Apparently, the average consumer (which is what corporate executives call human beings) are "too dulled to conventional advertising." To put it succinctly, our attention spans have become so short (due in no small part to advertising) that we don't pay enough attention to conventional advertising that interrupts our TV shows, falls out of our magazines, kicks up the wait time before our movies to 20 minutes, changes the names of stadiums and litters walkways, roadways and schools to sell us things we don't need and can't afford. Or worse, just to create "an image" for some product.  Newer and "better" ways of advertising have to be developed to get people to look at ads, ESPECIALLY when they don't want to. For example, product placements began hardcore when Reese's Pieces played a large role the alien's favorite snack in "E.T." Now it's sad and commonplace, but luckily it only happens in movies that are total crap like everything made by an SNL Alum or its producer Lorne Michaels. Recently Michaels put a Sobe soft drink ad right in the middle of an SNL sketch of a fake talk show. It was supposed to be funny. A couple in Kansas named their son Iuma after the Internet Underground Music Archive. They were paid $5,000 for this bit of abuse. Superbowl winners shouting "I'm going to Disneyland!" during interviews for cash is demeaning to them, their sport and our intelligence. Come on, does anyone really believe a professional quarterback is going to take a pass on all the champagne, drugs and women that come with victory to hop on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride?  Garbage is a GREAT way to advertise. Fast food wrappers are emblazoned with logos not for the five minutes we see them AFTER we buy fries, but because much of that garbage gets tossed out of car windows and sits on the ground for days. Schemes like these are viewed even by advertising executives as a way to "get their message heard" over the white noise of TV commercials, magazine inserts, junk mail, billboards, signs on busses, bus stops, cabs, buildings, over urinals, on web sites and in your face 24/7. Let's face it, it works. It's working right now.  By talking about how brutally stupid anyone would have to be to change their identity to that of a video game character, I help Acclaim sell their worthless game. For every 20 or 30 people who tsk along with me there will be one or two people who think to themselves, "A game about a time-traveling Indian? Who kills Dinosaurs?! BIONIC DINOSAURS!?! Sign me up for that!" Fait accompli. The deed is done. The only way to win is to move to a cabin in the woods for 30 or 40 years and even then you will catch yourself singing the words to the only song you know: "Fee-lin' 7UP, I'm feelin' 7UP. It's the crisp refreshing feeling, crystal clear and light. America's turning 7UP and it sure fe-els right. Feelin' like a 7, feelin' 7UP."  That's from memory, folks. A commercial that has not been on the air since the early '80s. Homework assignment: Go out and rent the original "Rollerball" this weekend, the one starring James Caan, not the hideous remake that came out six months ago. Watch it, learn from it and discuss.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      [Stay tuned 'till the end of this week's column for an EXCITING READER'S POLL.]  Lately, my friends and I have been overcome with a most unusual sense of nostalgia. It is unusual because we are all between 33 and 35 and have not felt the need to look backwards until now. It's all "weren't the '80s great!" and "If I knew then what I know now, well..."   When one works long hours and feels his mortality in aching muscles and joints while explaining why things are the way they are to one's kids, one starts to get all funky and emotional. It's nature's way. One day, while wondering what happened to that Loverboy headband you wore to school four months straight in the ninth grade, you get hit by a bus to make way for the next generation. For my part, I have enjoyed looking at old pictures of Council Bluffs throughout the ages (and if anyone has pictures they would like to share, they can e-mail them to me at the Nonpareil). Looking at the same streets I've roamed in stark black and white makes me feel connected to something greater. Reading of the exploits of Council Bluffs residents makes me feel as though anything is possible. Which brings me to this weeks big question: Why is prostitution illegal and why can't Iowa figure out a way to profit from it? Ben and Mary Marks, formerly of Council Bluffs, made their money in the entertainment business around the turn of the century. Ben ran several successful gambling establishments while Mary ran a whorehouse on Vine Street. It seems to me if we can have three major casinos in Council Bluffs to fill the various coffers that they fill, then we, as intelligent, morally flexible individuals should have no problem figuring out a way to not only make prostitution legal, but to score huge greasy wads of dough of it as well. Fact: Council Bluffs has twice the national crime rate. Fact: Council Bluffs lacks night life. Fact: One affects the other. We need to get the crime rate down. We need a nightlife. Now we can accomplish both.  Take something that is illegal, make it NOT illegal any more and watch our crime rate plummet. No extra cops, just pure mental gymnastics. Clean up illegal prostitution by making it legal. What's that? Prostitution is immoral, you say? Well, last time I checked, so was gambling until we realized how much money we could make from it. Let's not get bogged down now. Technically, gambling is still illegal. I can't run a casino out of my house, can I? We can do the same thing with prostitution. We keep the skanky, nasty truck stop variety and independent pros illegal then we rent out some space in the Omni Center and set up the sweetest, little state-sponsored cathouse this side of the Missouri! YEEE-HAAAW! The parking is awesome! This doesn't have to just be a Council Bluffs thing. You could take any empty storefront in any small town around southwest Iowa and convert it for the purposes of legalized, sanitary, stress-relieving prostitution. Walnut would be perfect, but I suspect quite a few cities 'round these parts could do it. Isn't prostitution bad for women? No little girl says "I want to be a prostitute when I grow up." Isn't hooking a shameful occupation? Forced prostitution IS wrong. Pimping is wrong. No diggity. But lots of people have jobs they hate or find shameful. I know, I used to do telemarketing. You know something else you never hear a little girl say? "I want to clean toilets when I grow up," "I want to be financially dependent on a man," "I want to make french fries all day" or "I want to have my 401(K) mismanaged by a Fortune 500 company," but it happens. Besides, men can be prostitutes as well. In my vision of financial security for the great state of Iowa, men and women will all have an equal opportunity to make whores of themselves for cash in a clean, safe, medically-regulated environment. They will put books in our schools, open free clinics, fund sexual addiction counseling to handle the sudden, but acceptable, increase in that affliction.  People will come for miles around to make us rich. Forget libraries, entryways and small civic improvements, this plan is bigger than all that. Iowa will be able to afford world-class medical centers, the biggest mall in the universe, underground asteroid shelters, our own space program, gold-plated hubcaps and furry hats for every city council member, city manager and big pimpin' mayor in the state. It's the 2K2, Iowa, let's look to the past to solve the problems of today and - I'd guess - tomorrow. Leave your hangups in Nebraska and let's get this fiscal party started, right? On a related note, I am conducting my own reader's survey. Send me the name of your favorite southwest Iowa "go-go club" by Aug. 16 at 9 a.m. The password is "Fidelio."

      Nature's first green is gold,  Her hardest hue to hold.  Her early leaf's a flower;  But only so an hour.  Then leaf subsides to leaf.  So Eden sank to grief,  So dawn goes down to day.  Nothing gold can stay.  -Robert Frost  I would like to be able to say the first time I heard these words it was in an English class, but the truth is I first heard them in "The Outsiders" at the Council Bluffs Drive-In.  I'm just a small town boy living in a lonely world who took the midnight train going anywhere and I am as sentimental as the next guy. Our drive-in theater is one of the few remaining in the United States and. You would be hard pressed to find a true C.B.-er who had not spent a night or 20 in the haze of youth watching dimly lit movies in the fresh summer air with the scent of Lake Manawa wafting from behind the screen carrying with it the promise of young love and the distinct odeur of corn dogs. To this day, I get a completely non-Platonic feeling when I smell frying cornmeal. Yes, the drive-in theater is a true American classic, a marriage of our love for movies and our love for cars. What could be better than those nights? My buddies and I would trip on out to the theater with a 12-pack of tall boys on ice in a five-gallon pickle bucket from Sam's Hamburgers and a box of Little Debbies Star Crunches to watch "Big Trouble in Little China," "The Goonies" and "Friday the 13th Part Who Cares." I saw "Batman Returns" at that theater with my nephew when he was 3-months old, not that he recalls it. I spent many a Fourth of July there eating hot dogs and watching the fireworks. I saw my first R-rated film, "The Screaming Cheerleaders," at the drive-in when I was a wee lad. For some odd reason, my parents thought I would sleep through all the screaming and jiggling. Doesn't happen now and it didn't happen then. "Love Story," "Smokey and the Bandit," "The Apple Dumpling Gang," "The Strongest Man on Earth," "Smokey and the Bandit II," "The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again," "Smokey and the Bandit III," "Smokey and the Apple Dumpling Gang Hook Up with the Screaming Cheerleaders" ... the list goes on. In retrospect, the movies never mattered as much as the company and occasion, because it was always a special occasion when you stayed out until 3 a.m. watching that real clinker at the end. Unfortunately, our drive-in theater might not be with us much longer and that is sad. Nothing gold can stay, I reckon. The land the theater sits on is up for sale and since it has a much greater value as a parking lot or strip mall than as a movie theater we all used to go to as kids, chances are pretty good that by this time next summer there will be one less thing to make Council Bluffs unique. Maybe there is something we can do, but I doubt it. This is just one of those times when you have to sit back and accept the inevitable. If the Council Bluffs Drive-In were a thriving concern, if it were packed each and every night with people buying popcorn by the ton and pop by the gallon, maybe it wouldn't need to close. But this is social Darwinism for you. The weak die while the strong plow them under for another car lot. Granted, I've been away for years, but the last movie I saw at the drive-in was "Batman Returns." Not "Batman & Robin," not "Batman Forever," "Batman Returns." That's about 10 years ago. So for my part, I haven't exactly kept the deep fat fryers of the drive-in filled with canola oil and the projectors filled with celluloid. Everything changes, that is inevitable. Sometimes things fall apart because the universe is an unstable place. Trees, people and suns die. That's entropy. Sometimes tastes change. That's why you can't hardly find sasparilla any more. And sometimes things fade out because they just don't make as much sense as they used to. Drive-ins were cool when air conditioning was rare. They were great social gatherings when we all felt much safer being out late at night. Drive-ins were the place to see movies when quality new movies came out less often, when people didn't have 300 channels, VCRs and DVDs at home.  The day of the drive-in is drawing to a close and while I hope the Council Bluffs Drive-In somehow makes it to 2003, I will have to catch whatever is playing out there this summer just in case it doesn't. It doesn't really matter what, just one last memory to add to the stack. Nothing gold can stay, but we can always remember that for far longer than most, we had a piece of living breathing pop culture history right here in our midst. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      This proposed Avenue G viaduct has got me a bit perplexed. I understand the need to move more traffic from one side of town to the other but it seems to me that people need to have a reason to go from point A to point B along a certain route, am I wrong?  What exactly is the motivation to travel from point A on Avenue G to point B further along Avenue G near 16th Street? Do 4,500 people a day really need day old bread and beef jerky that bad?  I am the perfect candidate for using this new viaduct and even I don't see the upside. I live on the east side of town, I go to Comic City and Lipstix (to do research on my novel) with breath-taking regularity and I can't see the advantage of a big bridge on G besides moderately improving emergency response times. I would think a better idea might be a newer, wider, swifter viaduct where the current one is standing or perhaps one on 9th or 5th that would make heavily traveled streets easier to navigate during crunch time. Getting stuck waiting for a train is aggravating and a painful reminder of how awkwardly Council Bluffs is laid out. The current viaduct is so heavily used, by Crom, it feels more like a parking lot than a roadway. Even with the new viaduct, there are still parts of town that can be totally cut off from the outside world if two trains are running at the same time. I call this section of town The Bermuda Triangle because I was once stuck down there wearing Bermuda shorts and was taunted by bikers. I may just be a simple country boy, but it seems to me that a another bridge is just trying to catch moonbeams with a butterfly net. The real problem in Council Bluffs is that we have railroad tracks running right through the center of our town from one end to the other.  In most towns, you see railroad tracks on the ugly industrial side of town, out of the way for the most part. With C.B., the tracks are about three blocks from City Hall. I grew up right by a set of train tracks and it can be annoying, but in all honesty, you get used to the screeching and honking, the exhaust, the ground shaking and the sight of a leviathon cruising past your kitchen window at 65 m.p.h. You hear about derailments, but you put them out of your mind. I even had a dog lose a leg to a train. Frankly, he should have known better than to chase it. And while train tracks aren't the worst thing in the world, they do have a stigma attached to them. There is "the right side of the tracks" and "the wrong side of the tracks." For over a hundred years, the vast majority of C.B. has had the unfortunate and inappriate distinction of being on "the wrong side of the tracks."  We can build all the bridges we want, but at the end of the day, we still have more tracks than an Amsterdam city park after midnight. We are wedged in between the river, the tracks and the hills. We need some breathing room and beyond picking the entire city up and moving it halfway to Glenwood, we might just be stuck unless we can get the Union Pacific to take their rails underground. Maybe we could take the streets under the tracks, it works like a dream out at big lake. At least then we could avoid turning the length of Avenue G into the same kind of wasteland that sits under the current viaduct and prevent Avenue G residents from becoming trolls. I'm just one guy with no degree in community and regional planning to fall back on, but I have played hundreds of hours of "Sim City." And if being Mayor Jerrett-san of Ho Chi Greg City has tought me anything, it's that it is hard to run a city of this size. You have constant growing pains. One little slip up like a flood, earthquake, plague of locusts or UFO invasion and half your town moves away. Getting over that 100,000 hump is hard. There's never enough money to do what you need to do let alone what you really want to do. And you would have to be psychic to know what is going to work ahead of time. Until we find the cheat code that let's us have unlimited funds, no crime, great education, jobs and entertainment, the best we can do is let our city council know what we think in the most rational manner possible. Let them know you have concerns in the Nonpareil opinion section and at council meetings.  While there is likely no solution that will make everyone happy, there are alway options to consider. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      In case you haven't noticed, America is really fat, though considering that 61 percent of adults are overweight or obese, it would be kind of hard not to notice. More frightening is there are three times as many fat kids not running around as there were 20 years ago, diabetes is epidemic and we all sit around with our thumbs no where to be found. Thank you cable TV, video games, fat-packed fast foods and disinterested parents. What is really starting to bug everyone is that it costs the nation $117 billion a year in health costs and lost productivity, according to the Surgeon General's office. Late night comedy pundits like Bill Maher and Dennis Miller get great mileage out of mocking fat folks and who can blame them. Fat people are the new homosexuals. Once upon a time, it was totally acceptable to work your hate out mocking gay people, now it's not so cool. But fat people? That never gets old. It's like they deserve it. Let's be brutally honest, everybody hates fat people. Even fat people hate other fat people. I'm a fatty and therefore entitled to be as brutally honest in my observations as I want much in the same way as I am entitled to unleash on the French because I'm a bit Gallic. I know fat people don't like fat people any more than skinny people do. We hate what fatness says about someone's personality, don't we? The slothfulness, the sloppiness, the gluttony.  You know the one's I really don't like are people who are just about 30 or 40 pounds overweight who have never even tried to lose that spare tire who feel they are entitled to tell me what I'm doing wrong when I have lost well over 100 pounds at different times only to gain it back. Those people really make me sick. If losing weight is so easy, tubby, dig those high school pants out of the closet and strut your stuff. You see it in kids on the playground, they're like little animals fixating on the weak, torturing them physically and mentally. It's fun, especially if you don't have special ed kids in your school. The only thing that kept me from beating on the fat kid in my grade school was that I WAS the fat kid. If I could have kicked my own butt, I would have. I dislike alternate terms for fatness like husky, chubby, plump, big-boned and burly. They soften the blow. I prefer the term "fat #@!$%&" because let's face it, that's what I am. If I had any self respect or will power, I wouldn't be a thunderchunk with a waistline the size of Rhode Island whose friends are embarrassed to be seen with him, who gets winded walking DOWN stairs and who has to pay women of questionable morality to talk to him in sleazy, out-of-the-way bars, now would I? News specials all talk about the problem. Talk, talk, talk, talk. All we really do is talk, talk. Finding a solution is a big deal suddenly. As a nation, we're like that fight guy who needed firefighters to rescue his 1400 pound mass from his bedroom only we are just now screaming toward 500 pounds thinking, "hmmm, maybe I should go for a walk or lay off the Dove Bars?" Ya think?  Looking for a solution just mirrors the problem of losing weight on the individual level. A move is being made by lawyers currently to do to the fast food industry what they did to Big Tobacco, i.e. find a scapegoat to make them rich. George Washington University Law Professor John Banzhaf, the mastermind behind the tobacco suits, recently said he believes it would be legitimate and feasible to sue fast food companies for misleading advertising. If it worked once, why not twice? If there is anything lawyers like it is a nice fat class action lawsuit they can dress up like activism as if the primary motivation to sue BK, KFC and Mickey D's is to help us all by raising costs. Yeah, that'll work. Food does grow on trees, doesn't it? There is nothing quite so frightening as Americans looking for a solution to what is ultimately a personal problem. Pass a law! Sue somebody! No matter how much money it costs employers, the government or the economy, fat is a personal issue. Every fatty out there is fat for their own fat reasons. Eating too much really is only part of the problem - though you wouldn't think so to walk into some of the buffets around here. Genetics, culture and lifestyle do play a part. So does psychology, food addiction, poor eating habits, bad dieting strategies, laziness and, yes, the content of fast food. These many different reasons alone make a class action lawsuit impossible because all the members of a "class" have to be fat for the same reasons and they could not possibly all be fat because they didn't realize fast food was fatty. So put that aside, the only thing this will accomplish is passing the buck. The real source for our fatness is a long-term cultural inclination we need to work against like spawning salmon. Mmmm, salmon.  Americans in 2002 still eat like 98 percent of us are working the fields 14 hours a day. We like big food fast, fatty and tasty. We have little concept of what is good for us or what is bad for us and like cavemen we eat everything we can. We are so bamboozled by fad diets we can't tell when science is giving us new clues. Carbohydrates may be a great source of nutritional energy, but not in the quantities we consume them. Huge bowls of pasta, bags of potatoes, sugar by the pound. I have seen "healthy" guys drink Mountain Dew like water for hours on end. Eight fluid ounces of Mountain Dew has 110 calories in it, 31 grams of sugar and 50 milligrams of sodium. Most non-diet pop is the same. That is like putting a gun in your mouth. Considering that "super-sizing" and free refills are common, a liter of this stuff has 440 calories, 124 grams of sugar and 200 milligrams of sodium. That's like consuming four apples dipped in salt only there is absolutely NO nutritional benefit. Look around any given restaurant you frequent for people eating vegetables or fruit. I dare you to find any significant consumption of fresh fruits or veggies, not canned, not drenched in syrup and NOT breaded and fried. It doesn't happen.  Americans don't really care much for fresh food that is good for them and so long as that trend continues to grow, so will our waistlines. Litigation just forces this ridiculousness into sharp relief. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      I like to read my old college paper online. The Iowa State Daily was OK to read and a great training ground for this line of work. Going back to school over the Web reminds me just how seriously every word we printed was taken - not just by staff and students, but by all kinds of extremists who enjoyed taking out their media frustrations on junior journalists. They could swear at us, but Dan Rather wouldn't put up with that nonsense. If you leave obscene remarks in Dan Rather's comment box, he will hunt you down and beat you senseless with his personal assistant's electronic rolodex. I know this, because Tyler Durden knows this. A comment left on that vaunted Web site (www.iowastatedaily.com-check out my old stuff) last Thursday got me to thinking. A poster from Hong Kong wrote about Americans, our precious liberties and common American complaints: "[Al-Qaida] wants to kill every last one of you. You really may have to sacrifice some things - short term - to still be alive tomorrow. Think about all your bellyaching when you see that your entire government has been destroyed." It is one thing to hear this kind of talk from Americans, but when our exact words - and I do think this is a fair, if overblown, sample of comments I've heard from the Justice Department, Ari Fleischer, Dick Cheney and some citizens - are spouted back at us, it takes on a different dimension. You know, if I had a cause I could conceive of, I would do something constructive. If the War on Terror resembled World War II or any conventional war, I'd collect tires and tin, give up sugar and meat, volunteer my service ... anything. But it isn't. This whole thing is more confusing than a David Lynch movie only without all the dancing midgets and psychotic lesbians. I can tell you this, though, before any of us start sacrificing the things that make America, well, America, in order to feel like we are safe or contributing to the cause, we better think long and hard about what it is we're giving up. IS surrendering civil liberties necessary? Is it temporary? Or is it just the start of something bigger? What should we be willing to sacrifice?  I've said all along, I don't have a problem waiting in line at the airport to have some knuckle dragger go through my underwear looking for pipe bombs and fingernail files. That is totally cool with me. I don't have a problem with the FBI questioning suspects or following leads when they get the notion to actually do those things. I don't have a problem with the CIA searching the Internet for al-Qaida communications. We've known for years the net isn't exactly private. Can we handle change? Sure, we can. Should we be vigilant? Absolutely. Should we be vigilantes? No.  Life changed after 9/11 and we all regretted that. Some adaptation will be necessary, sure, a greater level of awareness doesn't hurt. But let's not close up this great democratic experiment because of fear.  It's always the really good liberties we talk about giving up, too, like freedom of speech. My right to blab endlessly on a variety of subjects is just about my favorite civil liberty of all time and I take a dim view to shutting up. When we start thinking secret tribunals, martial law and trying Americans as enemy combatants are OK because American values like justice shouldn't apply when the heat is on, I get nervous. Worse than that, I get offended. We all should because our liberties and values aren't luxuries or privileges; they are our rights. Voluntarily giving up any of our rights isn't just putting the cart in front of the horse, it's dragging the horse behind the cart going 90 miles an hour down the Interstate, "Highway to Hell" blasting out the stereo. If we let our fears dictate our actions, we lose control of this country. If we voluntarily give up our liberties, if we become a police state where postmen, cable guys and truckers spy on us with some vague notion that it's right to do so, while Homeland Security repackages fascism and John Ashcroft convinces middle America that dissent is terrorism and martial law is no more offensive to the American spirit than community policing, then our enemies win a much greater battle than killing us could ever achieve. Our forefathers fought for our rights, they did not fight to create a government that does what it pleases because its citizens are too timid or apathetic to speak up. We better talk while we can, because I hear the sound of jackboots coming up the back stairs.  Giving up a few basic freedoms is not the same thing as going without cable for a while. It's like going without oxygen for a few days. The absence of liberty is not acceptable, freedom is NOT temporary.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      So there I was sitting on my old friend Mike's couch drenched in the green, geeky mist of science fiction role play and video games. It was the 24th annual Journey Beyond Summer Tour 2002. Basically, its 10 men in their mid-30s eating corn chips, swilling Mountain Dew and acting like jackass 16-year-olds for 72 straight hours. Good times ... good times. I'm playing a game I have never heard of called "Soul Calibur(sic)," one of those video fighting games where you need to know 327 special button combinations just to kick your opponent in the jimmy. I lose horrifically to geek No. 9 who has spent the last four and a half years honing his combat skills in his mother's basement 14 hours a day, and this dude thinks he's Conan the Barbarian. And he did it before I even had the chance to figure out which buttons did what moves - common courtesy in any social situation. "Yeah, that was really impressive beating a complete novice at a video game." Then geek No. 10 says to geek No. 9, "Hey, winning is winning." "Whoa," I says to him I say, "Winning is NOT winning."  Now, I know what you're thinking. Technically, winning IS winning and while it is a tautology like "1=1" or "God is because God is" and therefore not explicitly expressive of any greater meaning, logically a thing IS the equivalent of itself. There are still different kinds of victories and some are better than others.  So to prove my point, I told geek No. 10 that I would play him using only one button. He laughed. So did the other geeks. "What could this possibly prove?" I shouldn't be able to get so much as one hit and if I do, I count that as a kind of victory. Well, I think Jesus stepped in at this point, because I not only got a hit, I beat him. In fact, I won the next 10 games against five different geeks playing with seven different "characters" while I used only one button - and I didn't even press it that fast. "This," I said, "is better." Victory can be measured by any number of criteria. Beating a skilled opponent is better than beating a complete reject. Overcoming the odds is better than winning because you had it easy. Succeeding because you make a good product people need is better than making tons of cash defrauding the American people and sending the American economy into the toilet. I would argue that winning at all costs is what has gotten our country into its current financial grind. You can debate about whose failed economic policy put us here and blame the lingering effects of 9/11, but when it comes to the excesses of greed, America's soul looks like the fat guy in "Seven" chasing down a microwaved chimichanga at Kwik Shop with a 72-oz. Glutton Gulp. We are all on a financial roller coaster ride painting the seats an interesting shade of brown whether we want to be on the ride or not. This is because corporate America has been demonstrating all of the spiritual advancement of a tweeked out shoplifter at the 24-hour adult magazine barn outside Ashland, Neb. But it's more than that. Even professional baseball players are bulking up to beat the band; and if there is any sport in the world where great physical prowess is not needed, it's baseball. We have put winning at all costs before every other consideration. The stock market isn't back-to-the-jungle survival, it's money. I like cash as much as the next guy who thinks fresh vegetables and trips to the dentist are for rich folks, but how many yachts can you sunbathe on? How much jewelry do you really need? In these difficult times, I think corporate America should do what the vast majority of America purports to do: put their faith in the Lord. The next time you're at the office of your Forbes 500 company faced with a moral dilemma like adding up numbers correctly or using creative accounting methods, just ask yourself, "What would Jesus do?" Because nine times out of 10, Jesus wouldn't cook his books. In fact, I am pretty sure you never read in the Bible that Jesus was on his way to a wedding in Canaan when he turned to John, Paul and Ringo and doth spake: "I'm tapped, let's hit the ATM and pick up a really sweet Merlot." I'm all in favor of people living by the example of Jesus. When it comes to moral compasses, he is right up there on my list of top-10 saviors of all time. I feel comfortable in saying that Jesus was the kind of demigod who believed simple was best, winning was not as important as how you play the game and it is better to lose with your soul intact than to get loaded and go to hell. I've yet to invest for my retirement, and now seems like a bad time to start. But when I do, I will be looking for an investment firm that can use my money wisely, morally and invest in companies that see things my way. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      I don't know about you, good folks, but personally I'm not too comfortable with the idea of Joe the Cable Jockey and C.W. McCall the Trucker King spying on me for Uncle Sam under the auspices of Homeland Security and Operation TIPS. It isn't that I am planning anything more subversive this weekend than heckling that stinkpot of a sequel, "Men in Black II," but still...  No, my problem with the Operation TIPS program (Terrorism Information and Prevention System - where ordinary Americans spy on their neighbors and report them if they "see something they consider suspicious") is based on the fact that I don't think the average trucker, cable guy, pizza delivery boy, itinerant hairdresser, meter reader and lawnmower man is qualified to determine who and what is suspicious. Most people I know can't tell the difference between a Mexican, an Arab and a Pakistani without a flow chart. Oh sure, it sounds reasonable on the face of it, doesn't it? One need not be a law enforcement agent to call one and more eyes makes us more vigilant. Problem is that these days, being suspected of a crime is almost as bad as committing one. Should otherwise guilt-free Americans spend time standing tall before the man because they cut off  Joe Blow Trucker Junior G-man? This new Justice Department program wants a full 4 percent of the United States population ratting on the other 96 percent by August. And that is just for starters. Government informants, they are called. Nothing cute. Why hide it? Their job will be to report their suspicions to the Department of Justice for inclusion in a government database. If you weren't anxious before, you might want to think about it sometime this weekend when it hits you that since 9/11, we are suddenly living in a bad comic book version of a futuristic America where corporations run wild, patriotism and jingoism are confused and American citizens smile proudly while turning in their neighbors for having guests over at odd hours like 7:45. Now, I would never suggest that if a Middle Eastern man or even a Middle Western man comes into your feed and grain store looking to buy an unusually large amount of anhydrous ammonia and then asks you if you sell mercury timers without a hint of irony that you shouldn't give your local sheriff a ringy-dingy. Sure, let him see if the guy is a member of Al-Qaeda, a home-grown corn-fed terrorist like Timmy McVeigh or just a nutjob with a bad sense of humor. But here's the thing. I travel around southwest Iowa on stories and I love this place. Iowans are the greatest people on earth - right up there with Canadians. I wouldn't live anywhere else - with the possible exception of Canada - and half the time when I roll into a town, people look at me with great suspicion just because I rolled into town. Maybe it's the goatee. Maybe no REAL American would drive an '86 Chevy Caprice. Who knows? I've even been questioned by the local ice cream merchant in one small town for taking pictures on a public street OF a public street. No friendly curiosity. No warm welcome for a potential tourist. Just cold suspicion. As if a member of a world-wide terrorist organization would find something of interest to blow up in a town of 1,000 people, 90 percent of whom are out of town during the day. The United States Post Office, as an organization, took a pass on joining Operation TIPS and offered no explanation why. Perhaps they thought turning peeping toms into heroes or allowing heroes to become peeping toms should give us pause. This program is divisive and turns private sector employees into snoops.  Granted the cable industry has come a long way and I have been impressed with how fast they can fix a downed cable or install HBO, but now I don't even want to let them into my house lest my collection of 1960s Indian film posters be mistaken for terrorist propaganda by guys who slept through Western Civ. class. No offense, but I feel safe in saying the average cable jock is not necessarily an expert on world politics, cultures or what constitutes "suspicious activity" in my home. What sort of training does the government plan to give these guys? What kind of resources will it take to do background checks on its own informants? They do PLAN to do background checks on their own informants, don't they? How much does all of this cost? How effective could it possibly be? Couldn't all of this time, effort and money be better spent on border patrols, port containment inspection and common sense measures like airport security?  Operation TIPS is like getting an expensive yet faulty alarm system for your home when you don't even bother to lock the front door. What's next? Rounding up dissenters for reeducation? Arm bands? Brown shirts? Loyalty tests? Here's a TIP for you, stay away from MY window! - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      I don't know if you remember a while back I was talking about what I call "the tyranny of the nice" or not? Any way, what with Martha Stewart's fresh-baked cookies in the fire, I thought why not put all my good Council Bluffs manners to work and kick her while she's down.  This woman exemplifies the tyranny of the nice. She is the kind of woman who graciously let's guests use her bathroom and then immediately cleans the thing when they're done because the very idea of someone else's nether regions being near her porcelain gives her the creeps. Kick, kick, kick. Like most vampires, Martha Stewart won't be down for long unless we get a stake of imported Irish holy oak in her heart, stuff her mouth with roasted garlic from the garden and bury her in an elegant yet tastefully unmarked grave far from our villages and even then I have the strange feeling she would rise with the next full moon to show us all how to make our own Christmas wreaths out of cornstalks and pine cones. Now don't get me wrong. I hate Martha Stewart and everything she represents much in the same way that I despise Michael Jackson, Pokemon and dessert forks. There is something wrong about all of these things, especially dessert forks. Do I really need a separate fork for cake? Martha Stewart is Jersey social climber who has spent her life in search of what could be twistedly referred to as the American Dream, but what is actually just the bloodless pursuit of money and power. How does a stockbroker become a maven of domesticity? Much in the same way that a twisted freak and alleged pedophile like the King of Pop gets to walk around free. Image control, public relations and a whole lot of cash. Tight control of how one is perceived is the best way to worm your way into the hearts and minds of the nation. We all want a good life, decent food, that warm feeling that comes from doing special things for the ones we love. Martha Stewart gives us those things in tightly-controlled, anal-retentive, tasteful packages. She also has a media empire to dole them out to us at market rates. She reminds me of the crocheted toilet paper covers my grandmother used to knit. It's like, if you don't want people to see your toilet paper, don't leave it out. If toilet paper is so disturbing to you, why highlight its presence in your toilet by giving it a sweater with ducks on it? And why take the time to knit a little sweater for your TP if any of the above is true? Learning to string peppers, dry tomatoes, can, compost and preserve, all of these things make practical sense and enrich life, but why do I need Martha Stewart to teach me how to organize my kitchen the way she does? So she can sell me her line of K-Mart products? If I don't know how to use a doily by now, chances are I am not a doily kind of guy. In the time it takes to carve a turkey Martha-style, Thanksgiving is practically over. I'd like to invite Martha over to my house for dinner some night and serve her one of my favorite dishes: turkey franks on slices of wheat bread garnished haphazardly with Heinz 57 Sauce and green onions served on a plate I am pretty sure is clean with paper towels I got from the men's room at work because I knew I had company coming over. Oh and chips. Of course, the perfect vintage to go with this meal is diet orange Hy-Vee pop with lots of tap water ice cubes in plastic "Lord of the Rings" and "Batman Forever" collectible mugs. Now that's good livin'! Martha won't hang though, don't worry about her. Even if the Security and Exchange Commission can get her dead-to-rights for trading on insider information, she walks with a different crowd than you and me. Super-rich New York socialites like Martha don't buy and sell stocks on Ameritrade. They aren't putting their financial well-being in the hands of some 25-year-old stockbroker who got his business degree from ISU, I can tell you that much.  The rigged game is a lot more common than most of us realize. Cooked books, insider information and accounting schemes are just the latest in the greed buffet. Dick Cheney is haunted by his Halliburton days as VP, Ken Lay conducted the interviews for the regulatory commission that oversees his industry, even the president didn't practice what he preached. These things really shouldn't come as a great surprise to us. Government and big business have been in bed together for so long now that politics don't even matter. Wealthy corporations give to candidates of both parties because they don't care so much who wins so long as whoever wins is in their pocket. It was corporate sponsorship that kept the third parties out of the debates. Candidates are product. They want us to choose between Coke and Pepsi because RC and Dr. Pepper are too small, they might still have integrity. Martha Stewart is not the root of all evil, though, just a good example of the modern symptom. She seems like a sweetheart on the face of things, but underneath the clean matronly image, she has all the cunning ferocity of a wolverine and all the moral rectitude and ethics one expects from of a social climbing stockbroker. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Well, thanks to Steve Fosset, billionaire investment banker and intrepid adventurer, there is little point to becoming rich now. I was planning to rake it in at some point and start adventuring myself, but why bother. It's been done. Apparently, the greatest advantage to being a billionaire is you can afford to try repeatedly to fly around the world in nothing but a high tech hot air balloon with little more than 50 gallons of Gatorade, a crate of Power Bars, computerized weather tracking computers, digital satellite communications equipment, an electric blanket and a port-a-potty to seek the praise of a public you normally just feed off of.  It's good to know all you need in this life to leave your mark is a tub full of guts ... oh, and a bank account you can choke a horse with. Let me tell you about ma an with more intestinal fortitude than money - or brains for that matter - a working class hero with a dream to take to the skies, a man who would not let limited cash flow or no knowledge whatsoever of physics, engineering or aerodynamics stand in his way. Lawn Chair Larry Walters was a Los Angeles man, a truck driver who, like most truck drivers, wanted to fly. Unfortunately, Larry was saddled with poor eyesight and unburdened by a billion dollars with which to make his meager dream of flight come true. So 20 years ago on a sunny Los Angeles day in 1982 while sitting in his Sears aluminum lawn chair drinking Miller Lite (of course) and staring up at the afternoon sky at jets flying overhead, Larry had a vision and it was just crazy enough to work.  Larry calculated that 45 four-foot diameter helium-filled Army surplus weather balloons might have just enough pull to launch him and his lawn chair some 30 feet into the sky where he might enjoy the sensation of flight for a short time.  Larry's calculations included a few minor errors - namely it was all guesswork. Larry soared not 30 feet, not 100 feet, not even 1,000 feet into the air, but 16,000 feet into the busy sky over Los Angeles armed with a few sandwiches, some Miller Lite (of course) and a pellet gun to pop the balloons and facilitate his descent. Once in the air, Larry was afraid that if he popped the balloons his aluminum lawn chair flying machine might become unstable and he might really be in trouble or drop his beer.  Fourteen hours later, Larry wandered into LAX air space and drew the attention of commercial pilots who almost dropped THEIR Miller Lites before they reported the strange sight.  His dream realized and feeling the pressing need to go to the bathroom, Larry decided it was time to risk popping a few balloons and return to the loving bonds of Terra Firma.  Larry's descent was stable enough, but his tether lines blacked out parts of Long Beach for 20 minutes when he ran into them. On the ground, Larry was arrested. The FAA fined Larry $1,500 after they figured out exactly which rules he had violated. Larry gave up trucking, became a motivational speaker and in 1993 walked into a forest to shot himself in the heart at 44. Lawn Chair Larry has been immortalized for what some call "his stupidity," but that is short-sighted and unkind. Old Lawn Chair maybe wasn't the brightest bulb in the pack but he not only made his dream come true for a couple hundred dollars, he shot right past it, got a cool new job, achieved the height record for highest altitude gas-filled clustered balloons and a Darwin's Award honorable mention for not dying during the stunt. Anybody can make their dreams come true with with six multi-million dollar balloons and years to waste, but it's the guy sitting around eating Van Camp's Pork and Beans from a can, watching "Battle Bots" wondering if he has enough money to go to the dentist this month who gets a wild hair one day who makes the dream a reality for ALL of us. Honestly, who do you REALLY identify with more, Larry or Steve? Rest easy Lawn Chair Larry, not everyone down here thinks you are a complete tool. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Shots of dogs are almost as common on my camera as pictures of people. At the Pride Parade, in Bayliss Park or just out and about on assignment, if I see people with their dogs, they are about twice as likely to end up in the paper than people with kids. I'm funny that way, but frankly your dog says more about you than your kids. Your kids just look like you, a dog is a lifestyle choice. My family always had dogs growing up, partly because we liked dogs better than people, but also because people kept dumping them on us. So growing up, I never adopted an animal from the Council Bluffs Animal Shelter. We usually just kept the dogs that floated over our transom rather than take them to the pound.  With that said, we could only keep so many dogs and when we went to the animal shelter, it was to drop off some loser's dog. People dump animals in the vain hope that someone else would actually want to take on the challenge of a parvo-plagued bitch that had given birth within hours of being abandoned on a rock road from a moving car.  I don't know what it is about people who dump dogs in the sticks as though passing the buck keeps their karma in good standing, well, I assure it doesn't. More often than not, dogs that get dropped off get run over, killed by coyotes and bigger dogs or taken to the pound by a DECENT human beings. I spent some time at the Animal Shelter this week and I recommend that most people give it a try. You won't find a facility that does better with as little as Galen Barrett, chief animal control officer, has to work with.  I warn you up front though, it's depressing. Every dog, cat, hamster and iguana in the place is somebody else's botched responsibility.  Animal Shelter workers will tell you that if as many people who abandon their pets actually moved when they said they were moving and couldn't take care of an animal, Council Bluffs would be a ghost town.  One rarely sees more dedicated city workers. There are no Cruella DeVilles at the Animal Shelter, no stereotypical Hollywood hound haters. There are volunteers and employees who do their best to convince everyone who walks in the door to adopt. "I'll be honest with you," said one employee on my last trip. "If you don't adopt this dog, it will probably be put to sleep." Now that is salesmanship. They are always closing the deal at the Animal Shelter and they aren't even working on commission. There is something more important going on down there because every day starts with full cages. For each dog and cat that come into the Animal Shelter, one dog and one cat has to go out with an owner or they are put to sleep.  It is a harsh reality and not for the sensitive, you can bet on that. I had to curb my inclination to make eye contact or touch any of the animals because they aren't toys, they are innocent, living creatures brought into this world more often than not by the misguided intentions of people who either let their pets breed without regard or took on a pet capriciously and changed their mind later. I don't want to get their hopes up and I can't afford to get attached to an animal I can't help or take care of myself. Working at the Animal Shelter takes a kind of emotional fortitude this writer has not been able to muster. Sharon Powders is a clerk at the Animal Shelter and a member of Support Our Local Animal Shelter. She told me she used to cry every night when she started working down there and some of the women still do. It comes as a shock to many who realize a stray dog or cat has as little as three days from the time it enters the shelter until it is claimed, adopted or put to sleep. Abandoned pets can be adopted or killed right after they enter the shelter. Luckily, SOLAS volunteers and shelter employees can keep some of the animals around for much longer. They make space where they can and even take animals to the homes of volunteers who get nothing in return to find people who can take care of pets. It is easy to point the finger of blame and say someone needs to do something about this, but when it comes down to it, the "someone" is all of us. Our taxes fund the place poorly, so a donation to SOLAS is always helpful.  Volunteers are always needed because as it is, 15 people do the work of 30. Call Mary Jones at 256-2287 to donate time or money. And this can not be said often enough or loud enough for people to listen. GET YOUR PETS FIXED. Spay and neuter your cats and dogs. Uncontrolled breeding is the reason why this problem goes on year after year. A litter of puppies is not a donation to the Animal Shelter, it is bunch of dogs they might have to put to kill because someone else failed to take care of business. Resources are needed if the Animal Shelter is ever to make its way into the 21st century so while we are busy building gateways and convention centers, perhaps we could set a grant or two aside to expand and fund our shelter in a manner of which we can be proud. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      I am not a big fan of weddings. Next to funerals and graduations, they are my least favorite social functions to attend. My favorites are, in no particular order, ritual circumcisions, sweat lodges, armistice agreements and public executions. Of course, being a groomsman is much worse than just going to a wedding. At 33, all of my friends were married long ago. Then I decided to go back to school and hang out with 19 and 20-year-olds. Long story short about to get long again, three weddings in the last year so far and now one of my little buddies wants me to be a groomsman. It isn't basking in other people's happiness that I hate so much. No, I lie, I do hate that almost more than anything. My existence is pretty empty, bitter, dull, loveless, petless and even plantless so being asked to publicly acknowledge and participate in the joy of others is about as much fun to me as eye surgery.  There is something inconvenient about attending someone else's celebration of wedded bliss. The miserable individual buying the happy couple a gift is a rude social irony. But to have to stand up during the whole thing? That just crosses the line from friendly obligation to brutal indignity. And of course they're Catholic, too, so this thing isn't going to be a 15-minute job either. It's going to go on and on and on until not only the bride and groom feel married but everyone in the church, the guy down the street and even the lilies of the field. The nerve of some people. Frankly, I'm tempted to end the friendship just to get out of the wedding. If I had to drive far, miss "Farscape" or be out after 9 at night, I probably would tell them to go do something biologically improbable that weren't planning to do on their wedding night any how. My favorite part is the tuxedo fitting. Not the wearing of the tuxedo, although that bites too, but actually having a stranger measure all your body parts. I suppose if you are skinny as a rail or super buff it's no problem, but I'm a bit of a fatty the way Robert Downey Jr. kind of likes heroin. There is nothing less likely to put me in good mood than hearing the words "Brianne, could you bring me TWO tape measures?" The only saving grace is I will not be expected to pay for the rental of the monkey suit myself unlike most bridesmaids and their hideous dress. They should go on strike. Not only are they asked to look like hell in comparison to the bride, they have to pay for the humiliation of wearing their worst fuschia taffeta nightmares in public. At least there is the payoff of the bachelor party the night before and the reception right after, huh? Not for me, I'm on about four different kinds of medication. So these days I do all these things sober.  Alcohol is bad for you. Legally, ethically and morally I feel obligated to say so. But there are a lot of things alcohol makes easier, that's why it's a crutch. Explaining how you know the groom for four hours to Talula, the bride's great aunt from Keokuk even she hasn't seen since she was 3-years old, for example, that takes anesthetic. I really don't see any advantage to being married that just living together doesn't accomplish without all the fuss. Does it really matter if children are "legitimate" these days? Being born "out of wedlock" just isn't the stigma it once was. I think women would be better off if they gave up on marriage as an institution. They could keep their names and a lion's share of the power in society if you think about it. The difference between a patriarchal society and a matriarchal one is basically whose name the kids get. The whole taking the man's name thing really stretches back to the idea of women-as-property anyway. You no longer belong to your father, you now belong to your husband. Your dad has the goats to prove it. We're beyond that, so why not drop the ritual? Breeding doesn't have the same consequence it once did. Birth control has made sex largely recreational. Kids aren't needed to work the farm since family farms are quickly becoming a thing of the past. There are over 6 billion people on the planet so I think we accomplished the whole fruitful multiplicity thing. God's got to be satisfied with the way that command worked out. I suppose it is still pretty nice to have someone who is legally obligated to hang out with you constantly, but I don't know a man or woman who doesn't have serious complaints about their spouse. Men don't listen, women don't stop talking. Men are lazy, women don't stop talking. Men hide their feelings, women don't stop talking. The list goes on. They say married men live longer and that makes marriage a good deal for them. They don't tell you those extra years are spent praying for death. I don't care what THEY say, man was not meant to wear pants around the house. Still, when I see these anniversary announcements about some couple married 50 years or more, I think it must be worth all this effort. Marriages are like sitcoms. Most of them might be miserable, unfunny wastes of time, but when you get a really good one, it is an inspiration to everyone else to keep trying. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Occasionally I get questions and suggestions from people I meet. Today, I thought I would answer a few of them for the curious. Don't worry, the names of the innocent are left out so if you sent me an e-mail and wanted to know why your husband still looks at other women, you won't be embarrassed. The first question I get is "where do you get your ideas?" That is a good question and one I have hit on previously though not answered directly. I tap into something called running thoughts, that little conversation you have in your head. At least I have that little conversations going. I am not sure if other people do to the same extent or not. The other place I get my ideas is from the thousands of black squirrels in Council Bluffs. The squirrels are not what they seem and will give you ideas if you let them. So don't worry the squirrels. "Why do you espouse sentiments normally reserved for people much older than you like spanking?"  I am very much in touch with my inner child AND my inner old man. As a matter of fact, my inner old man regularly beats my inner child for swearing in public while my inner child is quick to point out that my inner old man also swears in public and is a hypocrite. I think that age is largely an illusion. Not just in some hippie-dippy, new age way, but in the very real sense that no matter how old you are it doesn't matter. You are still just as entitled to be a jackass as when you were young. More so in some cases. I have always admired the fearless manner in which many of my elders seem to live. Sure, inside they could be quivering masses of jelly, but to the world they could be hard core. They have seen a great deal and know a great deal. When you listen you can learn something from just about anybody whether they intend it or not.  Also, I like to be in touch with my inner hayseed and if that makes me a little self-consciously rural once in a while, so be it. "At a reunion with childhood friends, I discovered they had become self-centered, materialistic and boring. Why is it not possible to have friends at the age of 60 that are like the friends of 12 to 16?" Life can be a grinding experience. It's tough out there and the accumulation of material wealth has become a necessity in some ways and good practice in another.  I think there is a certain fearlessness we have when we are 12. Someone else is paying the bills. We can afford to like who we want, play as much as we want, love people without fear of rejection. Life feels like it will go on forever.  Maybe after so many years of doing for "me and mine" successfully, people get wrapped up in what they collect. It means they did their job well.  We have a lot of imagination when we are young and that tends to fizzle out when our brains settle into patterns. Imagination is really the firing of strange parts of the brain. It's like firecrackers, they go off only once and when you're out of firecrackers, that's it. So you need to keep buying firecrackers is how this analogy wraps up. I don't know, I think I am out of firecrackers.  "Are you aware that 'The Jungle' was written by Upton Sinclair and not Sinclair Lewis as you suggested?" and "How many people do you think caught that error. 1) Yes, I am. Sorry about that. I guess that is the kind of mistake you make when you are only kind of educated and type faster than you think. MEA CULPA! 2) Seven. Not too shabby. "Are you happy?" This one comes up fairly often in one form or another. I honestly don't know. Sometimes I am and sometimes I'm not. I believe it was the Kids in the Hall who said it best: the only way to be happy is to know you won't be happy all the time. That works for me. Happiness is not a destination to reach, but a way of traveling. Don't worry, be happy. Happy happens, too! Jesus don't want me for a sunbeam, the poet said. "Have you made arrangements for the after life?" Yes. I have arranged for body to be made into Soylent Green. Soylent Green, it's made of people!

      Life since 9-11 has gotten a bit tougher on the old psyche. I know I am not alone in this. It seems like we have only three choices: To obsess over the news, ignore the news or try to find that perfect balance that is "the new normal." Terrorist arrests, financial news, security lines, fear of the inevitable. And these are just for starters. Passive news reception is an option for some, but what about the conspiracy theorists among us forced by some demon or other to find the man behind the curtain?  Conspiracy theorists get a bad name, frankly. Any time two or more people get together to secretly plan an action that is unlawful or by some estimation unethical, immoral or against the rules, it constitutes a conspiracy. Regular folks lie, cheat and steal on a daily basis to cover their tracks. Are politicos better than us? Not likely.  It is possible, just possible mind you, that politicians occasionally hide, obfuscate or bend the truth they present to the public for a variety of reasons both well intentioned and nefarious - like cheating and stealing. Take the recent revelations regarding former Chicago gang member and convict turned international terrorist Jose Pedillo and his dirty, dirty bombs. Pedillo has been in custody for a month for his association with al-Qaida and his plan to unleash a radiological weapon on the people of his homeland. Yet, we are only just hearing about this subject now as FBI agent Coleen Rowley began her blistering commentary to Congress on the FBI's shortcomings. Coincidence? Yeah, like finding Robert Downey Jr. passed out in your swimming pool. And the national media dumps Rowley and jumps on dirty bombs because fear sells and everybody is buying. Righteous indignation is on sale this week. Buy two rants and get an impassioned plea before Congress absolutely free. Here is one tip that something is fishy. A dirty bomb is not much more damaging than a conventional bomb. It is more frightening because most people hear "radioactive" and go mental because "The Planet of the Apes" and "Attack of the 50-Foot Woman" put that fear there long ago.  What should scare us all more is the inability of the FBI and CIA to gather and share information as well as stop terrorism. Government sources should be arresting people's fears about dirty bombs where possible and necessary, not allowing them to run rampant to cover their own tracks.  Top this poo-poo platter off with the red herring in this case, Jose Pedillo, who managed to go from Chicago to Pakistan to join al-Qaida, should serve more to highlight the ineffeciency of our government's crime fighting agencies than to avert our attention from it. The FBI had no problem infiltrating the KKK, the civil rights or peace movements of the 1960s. The CIA could get agents into the KGB. Those groups can smell a fink a mile away. Americans and other westerners joined Al-Qaida and the Taliban easily enough to make the news. Those groups seem easy enough to infiltrate by amateurs but the pros can't do it?  If a spoon-fed white boy like John Walker Lindh and a filthy criminal like Jose Pedillo could both pass muster, anybody should be able to throw down a few "Allah ackbars" and get in. Realistically, it seems to take an earnest interest in Islam (which cannot be that hard to find or fake) not an expert knoweldge of Arabic. The timing of this latest round of dirty bomb scares stinks. Terror is the weapon of our enemies, but let's face it, working up the American people into a lather has been the tool of our leaders for quite some time. They have no trouble coming up with ideas and announcements guaranteed to scare us all stupid. The color-coded security warning system, routine vague alerts from John Ashcroft about the next attack coming in X number of days and occasional news releases that have that "freshly planted" scent. It doesn't matter what part of the political spectrum you call home, this is the game leaders of all stripes play with the public. Maybe it all started off with good intentions to prevent panic, keep us calm, get the war machine rolling or get things back to normal, but it eventually turned into a three-card monty game. You need a war, let's invade Granada or go back to Iraq two or three times without managing to get rid of Saddam Hussein. There's always the Balkans or Somalia. It is no coincidence that as The Cold War wound down we found ourselves with a new world full of enemies to go after on the nightly news. Economies stagnate in peace time, but get your war on and people are suddenly motivated and doing their best to not think anything that might get them in trouble. We are all living in a strange new world. But for the first time since the War of 1812, violence has come to our shores from abroad. It was easy to take things overseas - fighting, dissenting, getting on with democracy. The real trick now will be forging ahead with our American value system intact, but one thing is for sure, the old bag of tricks is starting to wear thin. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      I would like to say I don't understand people who are cruel to animals, but unfortunately that is not the case. I do not share their cruel intentions or abusive tendencies, but having been an American high school senior, I know what it is to be lowly and miserable and look for something or someone even more lowly to make more miserable than me. My apologies to the one freshman in the class of '90 I was mean to once. But I have no sympathy for people who give in to the craven, disturbed tendency to act out with violence toward the weak and suffer no guilt. It's just not Christian. To have dominion over the earth does not mean to rule with an iron fist, but with kindness and justice. Which brings us to Sherman. Last Thursday, a Labrador-retriever named Sherman was found with an arrow shot through his rectal gland and out his leg near 23rd Street and South Expressway. Dandi Haven of 2212 S. Sixth St. was ticketed for animal abuse Friday because animal control officers were able to follow a trail of blood from where Sherman was found to Haven's house. Sherman died Monday after several days of what I know was fine care at the Strohbehn Veterinary Clinic. Art and Jody Strohbehn have taken care of many of my family's dogs, cats and even one rat over the years. They are decent and caring people, the exact opposite of the kind of human being that would shoot a Labrador-retriever in the butt. After his relative guilt or innocence is determined by a court of law, Haven could face a two-year prison sentence and a $2,000 fine. Of course, he could have a very good excuse for shooting a dog in the butt with an arrow fired from a crossbow. I don't know. I wasn't there. One theory has it that Sherman, the Labrador-retriever mix, attacked Haven's rottweiller and Haven was left with no choice to but to grab his crossbow from wherever it was safely stored, load an arrow or "bolt" into it and fire it in the general direction of Sherman's anus, which in all fairness is about all one could hit on a dog when its back is turned to you. Hoses used to work on dogs when I was a kid, but these are dangerous times and one never knows if a Labrador-retriever is just a mutt or a member of Al Qaeda come to destroy our way of life. Two years in prison and $2,000. Does that sound like a steep penalty for animal abuse to you? It doesn't to me. When Jeffrey Dalmer was getting his start in life as a sociopath, he practiced on animals. Sociopaths revel in the control they have over another living creature. They lack empathy, the ability to understand someone else's pain. Serial killers and other sociopaths are fascinated by their lack of empathy. It's like when your foot falls asleep and you smack it on the floor and go "wow, I can't feel a thing." If you or I caused pain to an animal or another human being, we would understand its pain and feel bad about it. If you or I were sociopaths, we would not hesitate to inflict pain on an animal because our lack of feeling would fascinate us.  Eventually, the fascination with an animal's pain is not enough and sociopaths start to practice their ways on people. Some become serial killers or rapists, while others become cannibals seeing themselves as higher up on the evolutionary ladder. Whether you are a vegetarian or a carnivore, a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals or a member of People for the Eating of Tasty Animals, we should all be equally concerned with the abuse of animals because anyone who abuses animals could just as easily turn their attentions to peolpe. They are a criminal element capable of escalating crimes. As a society we need to punish animal abusers to the fullest extent the law will allow to send a clear message that it is wrong. We need to discourage this behavior in children who tend to play a little too close to the edge sometimes anyway. Personally, I have a soft spot for dogs and find anyone who would abuse one to be particularly despicable.  Since the dawn of time, dogs have been our constant companions. They have shared our food, our camp fires, helped us hunt and herd animals, guarded our homes and remained close to our hearts. They are members of the family. They teach us what unconditional love is. A dog will lay down its life selflessly for its family and besides a little kibble, asks for nothing in return. Dogs are closer to us than any other creature on this planet. I remember every chihuahua, poodle, husky, German shepherd, terrier, Labrador and mutt that was ever a part of my family. I cannot imagine a God that does not put a high value on the existence of creatures that bring so much joy.  I suggest we all watch the outcome of this case with great attention and concern. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Zippers! A fun new way to drink alcohol by slurping it in the form of fruity gelatin! Land-a-goshin'! What evil is this? We must protect the children! This is a stylized representation of the stance of Pride Omaha Inc. as espoused in a their recent newsletter (Vol. 23, no. 2) and on KETV. Normally, I would not pay much attention, but once again, Council Bluffs was dragged into the fray because Zippers aren't sold in Omaha, but they are available in Council Bluffs, which apparently shouldn't allow their sale even though most Iowans I know have the mental capacity (a grade school education) and the technology (Tupperware and a fridge) to make Jell-O shots. KETV could have ignored the non-story, but it's more fun to make Council Bluffs look like Sodom and/or Gomorrah for selling a legal product distributed throughout the Midwest and consumed for decades in all corners of the United States. The rest of the world is too hip to do Jell-O shots. While I fault no one for wanting to protect their children from the world's evils, it does raise certain issues about how we go about these things.  Realize that Zippers are new, but Jell-O shots are as old as the hills. A kid would still need to show I.D. to buy Zippers and while the containers might look like any other Jell-O snack, thus allowing kids to bring alcohol to school, there are several other products that could be used in the same way.  Bottles, for instance. Any bottle can hold alcohol. You can take the lid off a bottle of Tropicana, put in a shot of vodka and take a screwdriver to school. Any thermos, can of pop or flask for that matter could easily be smuggled into school with hooch in it. When was the last time any school checked for flasks? 1886? In junior high footbal, some guys used to soak their mouthguards in Jack Daniels. Anyone with initiative can take put alcohol in gelatin, but why? It's geeky. Hemingway never did Jell-O shots. It's time consuming. It takes hours to turn vodka into gelatin. It is kitschy and uncool. Jell-O shots are what tourists do on vacation and that's only if they never had one before. Let's face it, when it comes to keeping kids from doing the things we don't want them to do, we need to be Zen masters. We can't just think outside the box, we have to be the box the other box comes in.  Kids want to do anything adults don't want them to do because they think anything we don't want them to do is fun. They're right sometimes, too. Any number of things we try to keep kids from doing is fun. Candy, fire, TV, video games, sticking their tongues on frozen light poles, 19th century French lithographs, backyard professional wrestling, beating on their siblings, onanism, riding bikes after dark and the list goes on. And look at the absolutely terrible, un-fun things we are always trying to make them do just because they are good for them like broccoli, church, school, reading, learning, swimming, speaking Spanish, kissing strange aunts, being upstanding members of society and that list goes on as well. The psychology is devious. Kids are so sure we are trying to get them to do things using reverse psychology - even when we aren't - that when we are being straight with them, they assume we are lying. So we have to use reverse-reverse psychology by making it seem like we are trying to get kids to do the things we don't want them to do, pretend we don't care if they do or don't do the things we want them to or, and this is my favorite, pretend we are into the things we don't want them to do so they think they aren't cool. You don't want kids to do Jell-O shots? Get grandma and all the old folks to sit around doing them at the next family picnic, hand them out to any kids who want them. Make it a party. This tactic works to keep kids from playing badmitten, too. Shouting "the sky is falling" every time some new fangled product hits the shelves as if this is the one that means the end of western civilization only serves to draw the attention of children to the things we don't want them to do. They want the end of civilization. Read "The Lord of the Flies;" it's all in there. The same Pride Omaha newsletter said the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported 1,400 college students die each year from alcohol-related incidents. This information usually sends people into a "we must do more" tailspin when the truth is raising the drinking limit, making alcohol taboo for 18 to 20-year-olds and constantly talking about alcohol as though it were an epidemic does more to encourage drinking among minors than anything. I remember quite well what motivated me and my friends to drink in college when the drinking age was raised from 19 to 21 just before I turned 19. I drank every weekend to spite a law I believe was and still is ridiculous.  There is nothing wrong with drinking at 18 that isn't wrong with drinking in general. If we settle down a bit and gave our kids a few sips of beer or wine at the table as they grew up, they would be much less inclined to get hammered silly as if every illegal opportunity to drink is their last. Sometimes good humor and common sense will work wonders. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Summer is back with a vengeance and that means at least two things are certain. For one, "It's not the heat it's the humidity" will be heard at least 37 times per day from now until September when we start talking about how it never used to be this hot so late in the year. And two, throngs of kids will be free to roam the streets of Council Bluffs because legally there is nothing we can do about it ... yet. I like kids theoretically, but in practice it is just another matter entirely. We all like our own kids, it's just other people's kids who leave their bikes in front of stores while they clog the candy aisles trying to figure out how much sugar they can buy for 45 cents. It seems that no matter how many skateboard parks and playgrounds we build, malls, grocery stores, parking ramps and pharmacies will always be number one with kids.  A close number two is the Bayliss Park fountain where one can toss a coin, make a wish and watch as children fight to steal that coin/wish in front of your eyes. It's a free-for-all out there and on any given day, scantily clad teens can be found scuba diving in our public fountain looking for spare change to buy anything from wacky tobacky to backless shirts to copies of "Catcher in the Rye" for all I know. I don't know who Genna is, but if her greatest accomplishment was being here in 2001, she really needs to write it someplace else besides on the concrete in Bayliss Park because I think I speak for everyone when I say, "Who cares?" It's like the end of the days or something, isn't it? There oughtta be a law. Oh wait, there IS a law, it's called don't steal, don't vandalize and keep your feet and the rest of your body out of the fountain. Those kind of things may seem quaint in Europe, but in Council Bluffs, they're just nasty. Something else you see in Council Bluffs that might be requiring an ordinance soon has to do with the number of dudes who walk around without shirts. Maybe I'm a Puritan, but it seems recent innovations in shirt technology allow men to keep cool without exposing their nipples to the world. Sure, it's a fun to take a drive on a hot summer day, window down, shirt no where to be seen, but give us a break. How many shirtless guys riding kid's bikes in jeans have to pass one another before one of them says, "Oh, how embarrassing, we wore the same outfit today." Either don't drive drunk or buy bike shorts.  Show a little pride, folks, you've got a closet full of Ozzy Osbourne, Pink Floyd and Ratt T-shirts gathering dust, show 'em off. Concert T-shirts are not only festive and let everyone know who your favorite bands are, they are made from material so thin as to be the next best thing to nudity.  You know what smells like magic? The Frito Lay plant. I dig that. No jasmine or cherry blossoms for me. Give me fried corn. You know what else is fun on a hot summer night in Council Bluffs? Going to the emergency room with a panic attack. Thank you Al Qaeda! I was a pretty twitchy freak a year ago, but now... WHEEEW! Apparently, I'm not alone in this, according to my doctor, three are millions of people who, if they weren't depressed before are stewing in their own juices now.  Since Sept. 11, the number of Americans afflicted with anxiety, depression and more has sky-rocketed, but I figured I could handle it.  Who was I kidding? I could barely handle high school let alone the rainbow of emotions that comes with trying to live in, figure out and deal with America post 9-11. One good thing is I learned a new definition of hell: Going to the ER feeling like you are going to die and being told to sit down, relax and fill out forms then sitting in a little room to wait for a nurse, then a doctor, then the nurse with a shot, then the doctor to see if the shot worked while everyone looks at you like a tweaker and you're wondering how you're gonna pay for this.  Three hours, a couple hundred dollars and one shot later and I still don't know if I am good to go. So in the name of putting my business out there for you to mull over, I over you this bit of advice. Don't swallow it. The anxiety, the pain, the grief. Don't assume you can take any amount, shove it down hard with your foot and keep on trucking because even if you never end up in the ER with a little wussy panic attack like me, you could just as easily end up there with a heart attack, stroke or something else you might be less ashamed of but even more damaged by. And I want to say I'm sure everybody did their best under the circumstances though I am not 100 percent clear on the details. Such is the nature of bad brain juju. My favorite part of summertime in Council Bluffs so far this year? How about 3 a.m. on a Monday morning when you're driving across town to the all-night pharmacy to pick up a prescription for alprazolam about an hour after the lorazepam has kicked in feeling like an extra on "ER."  All the drunks are in bed or at least taking the side streets. A calm falls over the city that won't be broken for another three hours. Slowly you realize that for better or for worse, this is your town. You can really be yourself here.  Thanks for being there, Mr. Bowen. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      There are two things I don't get into: George Will and sports on TV. I despise George Will. His smarmy elitism and ministry-of-propaganda style of prose leave me cold. Watching televised sports and listening sportscasters go on about said sports does nothing to trip my trigger. That's me. To each his own. I could care less if a guy paints his whole body to support a football team or because he is going to a sci fi convention. It's the same to me.  I played baseball and football as a kid. It was good exercise and occasionally quite fun, but even in the little league and public school ranks, sports have a dark side.  Unfulfilled adults tend to live vicariously through kid sports in a most unhealthy manner at times. No hockey dads needed to die to prove that point. And why anyone who didn't go to a particular college should care how that school does in the playoffs is beyond me as well, especially when that school is in another state. I occasionally find some reasons to agree with Mr. Will and this week his Newsweek column struck a chord. While I still found his manner of expression as soothing as chewing on tin foil, his position on Title IX made sense. Title IX is the 30-year-old policy that outlaws sexual discrimination in education. It makes it actionable for males and females to be unequally represented on the playing fields and gym floors of America's schools. Now I may not be able to tell you what channel ESPN is, but I do appreciate athletics. Children and adults alike should participate in competitive sports for their health as well as for confidence and discipline. Last year, my alma mater, Iowa State, was forced to cancel its baseball program because there were more men playing sports than women. Old George says the liberal establishment would like to social engineer everyone into androgyny, i.e. men and women are all basically the same in interests and skills and should be given exactly equal opportunities in all things until we have a society that is 50-50 down the middle in everything. George is a tool and makes no allowances for good intentions, but he has an agenda and only accusations of mind control can cause enough fear to make us George's willing servants. Regardless, he is essentially correct when he says Title IX is not only unfair to men who just like sports more than women, but that by trying to make society conform to a model in which women are not equal until they act like men, is unfair to women. Does George care about women? Probably not. I care, though, and I still think Title IX hurts more than it helps. Studies have shown that girls who participate in sports are much less likely to grow up to be doormats, victims or bundles of molly-coddled eating disorders. I am in favor of anything that genuinely improves the lot of women. Should I not speak in hushed, reverential tones glowingly about all things feminine, you will forgive me, I learned this behavior  from my mother. Yes, my mother, a woman as intolerant of weakness in her own gender as any man accused of misogyny. She cannot stand prissy little hausfraus who talk a good game about being equal to men while crying to get what they want and asking their hubbies to take out the trash 'cause its icky. She works construction and at just a shade over 40 (wink) not only keeps up with the 18-year-old males on her crew, sets the pace. Her mother was much the same way. She could kill chickens all day half drunk with a cigarette in one hand and a knife in the other. She could cook Sunday dinner for 12, beat 10 grand kids and do the dishes without the help of automation. Did she complain? Yes, yes she did. She was strong, not insane, but like she used to say, "somebody has to pop out 6 kids and it ain't gonna be a man."  Oddly enough, neither of my maternal influences would be considered darlings of the feminist movement because underlying most feminist movements, there is this constant drone of self-affirmation. "We're strong, we're smart, we're just a good as any man."  The dirty secret of self-affirmation is that you only need to say those things because you DON'T believe them in the first place. My progenitors never believed women were inferior and had no need for reassurance. I treat men and women as equals and if a woman comes to me like we're at recess and wants to know why I'm so mean, I get just as irritated as I would at any man who came to me with that nonsense.  From my mother and grandmother, I learned women are equal in spirit, not identical in ability. Equal in potential, not similar in interests, skills, goals and desires. And that's OK. Both would disdain Title IX and what it does to sports and women. It does not ultimately serve women because it treats them like weak, little girls who need a head start in a foot race on the assumption they can't win with equal footing. That is no message to send. I learned in fifth grade that the head start meant you never could win even if you crossed the line first. It was a ruse.  It has been very frustrating for me as a man ahead of the equality curve because I refuse to say with a delicate patina that I believe in equal pay for equal work. That men and women are entitled to equal treatment under the law. That when it comes to professionalism, basic humanity, self-sacrifice, loyalty, friendship and worth, men and women have equal claims to endowment by their creator. As the comedian Sinbad once said, "Women be different than men." By the same token, men be different than women. Is that wrong? Far from it. Our differences can be strengths. Just give everyone the opportunity to play sports and maybe women will one day participate in the same numbers as men. But maybe they won't.  Eliminating America's pastime because the women's swim team only has five members does nothing to help women except make a few of the more insecure ones feel less inferior while perpetuating the illusion of absolute equality. So let the games begin in earnest and maybe we will eventually figure out that men and women don't need to talk alike, think alike and act alike to be equal. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Every week, kids spend an average of 40 hours with TV, Internet and video games, according to Stanford University professor James Steyer, author of "The Other Parent," which breaks down media culture into who watches what when and how much while lamenting what they could be doing otherwise.  The shocking comparison is that kids spend about 30 hours per week in school and only about 17 hours with their parents, but let's face it, most of that time is spent talking about last nights episode of "Friends."  Who would have guessed TV, video games and the Internet were interfering with our daily human interactions? As the great Leonard Cohen said, "Everybody knows." In an interview with Paula Zahn on CNN, Steyer, who has either a doctorate in sociology or a masters in the obvious, quantified what we all suspected but were afraid to acknowledge: kids watch too much TV. Steyer then said a few derogatory things about how family hour is now as dirty as all the other hours. It's a chaotic free-for-all! Nail crooked boards over the windows and get your squirrel gun, Johnny; it's bedlam! Personally, I am not bothered by the anything-goes attitude on TV. Show for show, programming is much higher in quality today than when I grew up watching "Three's Company" and "The Dukes of Hazzard." Even favorites like "The Incredible Hulk" and "Battlestart Galactica" were pretty much dreck compared to "Enterprise," "ER," "Seinfeld," "The X-Files" and the show that never slows down, "The Simpsons." I should nt be surprised to see Steyer talking about the kids, they sell and a media savvy Stanford prof is going to know how to move his product. But media overindulgence, in spite of the benefits of the information age, is bad for people all ages and for a variety of reasons.  I use myself as an example of the worst humanity has to offer. Take from it what you will. For one, staring at a TV or a monitor all day long drives a wedge between you and other human beings. I am pretty much an anti-social misanthrope and when I think about getting out versus staying home to watch "Dr. Who" or "SNL," I often take the chair most traveled. The characters on long-running series act as surrogates for human contact. These people are like friends we tune in to catch up with and when we actually catch up with old friends, how much time do we spend talking about TV?  Take all this recent hullaballoo over old shows. Twenty years of Must See TV, 30 years of MASH, 50 years of CBS, 75 years of NBC, the Cosby reunion, the Laverne & Shirley reunion, Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Burnett and the list goes on.  Add to that the number of series and characters that were killed off in a huge display of emotion to tear-jerker season finales and you get a melange of fpre-fab angst over people and places that don't exist.  It's like losing family members. I watched the 20 or 30 episodes NBC took to kill off Mark Green from "ER." It was like a TV-14 snuff film. The guy leaves the ER for the last time, then there was the letter, then we get to watch him die in Hawaii while "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" plays and all our favorite characters past and present (minus George Clooney whose career will no doubt suffer for his insolence) wept for our entertainment. I believe it is wrong to invest in these characters and I STILL do it in spite of the fact that I am almost relieved when summer reruns start and I feel like I don't have to keep up any more. And the news? It is pretty safe to say the news is just another form of entertainment designed to get you to buy stuff. News segments themselves are commercials. How much air time has been devoted to Vanilla Coke? It dominated "The Today Show." If Coke didn't pay NBC millions, I'd like to know why. "The Today Show" is pretty light fare, which ALMOST makes that kind of schilling OK, but CNN Headline News has gotten almost as bad as they emulate FOXNews. I don't know who these chipper pep club rejects are (with the exception of Andrea Thompson who was more convincing as a telepath on "Babylon 5" than as a CNN anchor) who banter through the news like it's a coffe klatch and I don't WANT to know. I want the news. I don't need to wake up to a smiling face and expensive eye jobs. Give me Walter Kronkite, Harry Reasoner and Ed Murrow and dump these 23-year-old cheerleaders back at the frat house they came from. The Internet is often seen as Pandora's box revealing the world's evils to unsuspecting youth, but at least it is closer to reading a book than TV. Video games may be violent time wasters, but their possession is not practically a necessity like TV ownership. Be honest, most of us look at people who don't let their kids watch ANY TV as abusive and freakish and that's if we can find anyone like that any more. Media overload is bad for kids, but in our desire to root out everything that might harm them, we have forgotten we are susceptible as well. Endless hours paying attention to media minutiae is time better spent focused on ourselves, our families and our friends. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Tradition is wonderful, isn't it? Gives us all something to do over and over again without considering why. Like Christmas trees. Where do they come from? Not the Bible, that's for sure. Tradition makes it easier to claim outside forces or wicked little malcontents are oppressing us and trying to destroy our way of life when they insist we follow another tradition like the separation of church and state. That's a little regarded American tradition established to PROTECT everyone's right to worship at the altar of their choice without the tyranny of the majority forcing its views upon us. We tend to lose sight of that and assume it is only the atheist or the communist that somehow wants to keep religion out of our very secular, very public schools, but it isn't. Anybody with religion on their mind should want to keep religion sacred and out of the secular arena. Woodbine will be holding their graduation today after a bit of a tussle over whether or not it was cool to be singing the Lord's Prayer at graduation ceremonies for what has been described as quite a long time. "It's the will of the majority," they say and shouldn't the majority be able to promote whatever religion they feel is best? No, because religion is personal and no one is abusing you by not allowing you to force your views on them. It isn't right for the Lord's Prayer to be recited, sung, pantomimed, acted out with puppets or animated by "Simpsons" creator Matt Groenig in a public school ceremony. Most people know this on some gut level when you ask the question right. "Would you mind ME forcing MY religion down YOUR throat?" Then they get it and mind very much. Before that, we are treated to endless rationalizations about why it is OK for the majority to make their religion dominant though the term "mob mentality" has never been a compliment.  Keeping school and religion separate should be sacred to all of us and the reasons should be clear as well. Since they have once again gotten lost in the shuffle, I will be happy to go over again why it is to every single American's advantage in the long run to not force religious beliefs on other people. Primarily, what comes around goes around and if you want to maintain your right to worship or not worship how you want to, don't open the secular door to religion because you cannot control who is going to want to walk through it next. There are plenty of religious people out there who think women should keep their mouths shut, do what their husbands tell them and stay out of the work force and they are not all Islamic extremists in foreign lands, some of them call Jesus their Lord and live right here in the U.S.  We could waste time on the details of the Woodbine case, but that is a mistake. The issue does not require a discussion of the ICLU sticking its nose into local affairs. They were asked for help. Enough said.  We could get into the debate about whether two students should be allowed to cause this much strife. Well, the size of the group complaining doesn't make them right or wrong. Civil Rights leaders, abolitionists and black people in general were in the minority when it came to seeking freedom and equality yet history has proven their rabble-rousing to have been justified.  Jesus himself was in the minority, did that make him wrong? Religion in our public schools is a bad idea not because there is anything wrong with religion, but because we all have our own ideas about that should remain inviolable. Every time someone tries to justify squeezing some religion through the cracks, we end up with a situation like we have in Woodbine where rational thought is lost in tangents and minor details.  We could address the ICLU sticking its nose into local affairs as if they were outsiders who should mind their own business. But they were asked in. We could get into the debate over whether two students should be allowed to disrupt a tradition the majority seem to be into, but numbers don't determine who is right. We could talk about how this got started because so many kids wanted to keep the Lord's Prayer in the ceremony when the school board was planning to cancel it.  We could get into a debate about whether or not anyone is being forced to sing religious songs when they could have simply chosen not to participate. But the fact remains that in the United States we took it upon ourselves to keep our religion and our government separate because we didn't want anyone getting between us and God and now suddenly we have it all backwards and think the separation of church and state is the problem. Well, the only thing keeping this country from going over the edge into the same kind of whacked out religious fundamentalism we see so clearly in our enemies is that occasionally people like the Skarins and the Iowa Civil Liberties Union take it upon themselves to make some noise. It is the easiest thing in the world to not rock the boat, but it isn't very American. Sitting on the sidelines and letting events roll over us is not what our Founding Fathers were preaching about, why should we feel differently today? I subscribe to something Jesus himself said about public prayer and that is it's preferable one should pray at home in private than loudly and publicly so as not to confuse grandstanding with faith  We tend to overlook those parts of the Bible when we are getting our religion on, don't we? Suggesting the Skarins should have just decided to sit this one out due to their conflict with singing the Lord's Prayer isn't very American in my book.  Should kids who don't like getting beat up by jocks stay out of gym class? Perhaps students who don't agree with the majority political view should stay out of debate club? Maybe students who don't agree with the majority religious view should just go start their own special parochial schools. Oh wait, that's what we're supposed to do when we WANT to have religion in schools. Hmmm, I guess alternatives DO exist. In spite of the rhetoric of those who claim the majority of Woodbine residents are being oppressed by the whims of the very few, the Skarins were right, the court knew it, the Woodbine school board knew it before the fight started and it took some guts to do something about it. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      In another attempt to get everyone thinking about the same thing and with the growing popularity of book clubs, recent efforts have been underfoot to get all of Iowans to read the same book in the All Iowa Reads program.  This is not new or particular to Iowa. Seattle, a highly literate and hip town, was the first U.S. city to do this back in 1998. It makes for nice conversation about something meaningful and will continue to do so until the debate about book choices becomes so ridiculously politicized that it collapses under its own weight. My personal recommendation was for "Huckleberry Finn" by the greatest American author who ever walked the earth, piloted a riverboat or sank heavily into debt. I'm talking about the one and only Samuel L. Clemens or A to the K to the mother scratchin' A, Mark Twain (fanfare, lights go up, fireworks, music swells and ... scene!). You can cast your own vote at DesMoinesRegister.com/extras/books/index.html. Interestingly enough, one of the books nominated that I would also nominate is George Orwell's "1984." Mr. Orwell would be among the first to get a good laugh at the idea of nearly 3 million people reading his book so they could all be on the same page about something. Then he would think about the boost in book sales and say loud and proud, "screw the proletariat, buy my book!" "1984" is an important work of futurist fiction and if I were making a list of important books people should read, I would put it right alongside Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" as book most of us should read somewhere between 16 to 22 when we are old enough to understand things greater than ourselves and young enough to get worked up about it. The anonymous gentlemen who recommended "1984" on the Des Moines Register site had apparently missed the point of the book completely when he said it would be good "for all those who think 'communism' is 'harmless' and for all those who do not recognize the dangers of political correctness or totalitarian governments." Yeah, try again, pal, and keep the lights on next time. Anyone who uses quotation marks that liberally has obviously missed a point or two. While one would not argue against the arguments against "totalitarianism," "authoritarianism" or any other "ism" for that matter, to reduce "1984" as a mere condemnation of "communism" would be like dismissing Sinclair Lewis's "The Jungle" as a "vegetarian cookbook." Orwell was smarter than the average bear and when he pointed the finger, he pointed it squarely at the heart of man for the dangers of the new world order following World War II were many and broader than a flawed ideology or two. They struck at the core of our race, at the cracks that will one day threaten to bring the walls down around our ears. Even people who have not read "1984" feel they have a passing understanding of it because it is commonly referenced in "the media"  every few years in stories about technology and privacy issues. "Is Big Brother watching you? Find out tonight at 10 when we look at Web cams." Privacy was an issue in "1984," but technology never was. For my money, neither was the most important theme. In and of itself, having computer keep track of accounts, posting cameras in public places and getting searched at the airport are no more relevant to freedom than the fact that we mostly live on top of each other any way.  We are not alone most of the day and when we finally do get a moment to ourselves, chances are no one cares what we do and why should they? We can't even muster up two political parties with significant differences let alone a third political party to challenge the establishment. In a country where practically no one votes, Big Brother has nothing to worry about. There is not much political thought in the United States let alone philosophies, religions or counter-cultures that might prove dangerous to our way of life. No, we are watched all the time and most of us like it because it makes us feel secure and when something bad  happens, terrorism, crime, credit card fraud, identity theft, we complain we were not being watched closely enough. Orwell had more to warn against than being watched.  One concept that made my synapses light up like a Christmas tree was that those who govern know the best way to control the public is it to have a handy enemy.  The Cold War was nearly 50 years of 1984-style us vs. them that got pretty much everybody thinking the same way during the witch hunts of the '50s, the nuclear arms race and several police actions/wars. Iraq has been nothing if not a convenient enemy to be called on in a pinch. Saddam Hussein is so perfect in the role of America's enemy, he looks cast for the part by Hollywood. At any given moment, the Iraqis are violating sanctions, not allowing inspectors access, violating human rights or crossing into no-fly zones so we could theoretically unleash on them any time the president needs a boost in his ratings or to switch the attention of the press off his sexual indiscretions. We shamefully admitted how glad we were to have to something unify us all and get us all thinking along the same lines after 9/11. As if diverse opinion were a bad thing. Orwell new thought was not possible without language when he envisioned the Newspeak Dictionary. I am routinely disturbed by how insufficient my Webster's has become. Half the vocabulary words I learned in junior high don't seem to exist any more. A dictionary has one purpose and when it fails at that job, we lose important concepts and the means to self-expression. Orwell showed up that we like our demagogues no matter who they are. We like talk about freedom more than we like to have it. He showed us a world where progress is measured in the capacity of men to suffer more, have less and say nothing. He knew we might one day come to love having the boot heel of oppression on our throats ... forever.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      As this is one of the first springs I've had since I started taking medication for diabetes, I feel healthier in many ways than I have in quite awhile.  Spring is doing its number on me and it feels good. Ahhhh, sweet youthful energy.  Not to be vulgar, but whether it is by nature's original design or the generous benefaction that is owed to a bounding recovery, one's amorous inclinations have begun demanding greater attention.  Whereas recently the notion of fulfilling the glorious duties of the grand scheme of evolution known as fruitfulness and multiplicity for lack of primal drive had drifted by the wayside, this season has rekindled those divine rhythms. In short, gimmee a freak momma, as Sir Mix-a-Lot said, preferably one with a good-sized brain and a great tolerance for the shortcomings of men because I have those in abundance. But where in the wide, wide world of sports is a youngish man whose bloom is temporarily refreshed yet fading to go looking for love in Council Bluffs, the City of Dreams?  Let's face it, there are about 10 people in my age range here and half of them are guys.  People are born here, they move away and then they come back to raise their kids. If I have seen more than a handful of 30-somethings in the last year who were single, gainfully employed outside the arena of exotic dance or looking for a mature relationship, they were tweakers. Necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation is the baby's daddy. So where do you go when you have to make do? Top-10 places to meet women in Council Bluffs. The checkout line at Super Saver. I have found the cashiers at Super Saver to be the closest thing I could have to a meaningful relationship with another human being without getting blood tests first. They are hard-working, courteous and friendly. The fact that they are forced to behave that way is a small detail I choose to ignore. Beauty schools. I have found women studying the cosmetic arts to be ambitious and well-coiffed. Their work brings them in contact with the occasional gay man so they are tolerant of artistic mood swings. Iowa Western Community College. Dreams go to be reborn there. Theater types, music buffs, adult education devotees. Oh yeah. Take a French class, throw some pots or just wander around pretending to be an interested student some day and you will meet all kinds of ladies bent on self-improvement. IBP. Say what you will about a woman who processes meat all day but a woman who uses a knife for a living has to have good hand-eye coordination, stamina, dedication and passion. Working knowledge of Spanish is helpful.  The Council Bluffs Public Library. Mon dieux, you want to talk about exciting and brainy ladies, sit in a book club meeting some night talking about modern fiction. The down side is most of these ladies go to book club meetings to get away from their husbands for an hour or two and then run right back. A durn shame if you ask me. A working knowledge of English is helpful. Sapp Brothers. I know what you're thinking. "Sapp Brothers? Isn't that a truck stop?" Yes it is, but there are a surprising number of women who hang out there at night looking for dates. You have to give them credit for trying. Both hospitals and every clinic in town. Develop a good long-term illness requiring routine maintenance and frequent office visits. Dress well and pretend to be nice to the staff and somebody is bound to take pity on you eventually. You need to work fast though, HMOs have made sure your actual contact with medical staff takes less time than the average trip through the Burger King drive-thru. Burger King. Free refills on pop and a relaxed atmosphere make BK the next best thing to your neighborhood single's bar these days. Pick a favorite table, read, work on your "movie script," look like a brooding intellectual and try not to freak anybody out and something should happen. The county treasurer's office/DOT. These two are forever linked in my mind since they are both government offices I frequent when I need a license renewed. Unlike larger states where the pressure of waiting on lines of angry people seems to drive the attendants insane with hatred for all humanity, here they seem to take it all in stride. That takes patience by the bucketload. They're always nice and if you don't take your problems out on them they won't make your life hell. I have to respect that in anybody and that goes doubly so for a potential mate. And finally your local video store. I like a lady who knows her fine cinema, but the down side is it's kind of hard to look a woman in the eye or make conversation after she's seen you rent "College Girls 37," "Schindler's Fist" or "Joe Dirt." Someone mentioned church as a possible, but I have to tell you, the idea of engaging in religious activity in the hopes of meeting women seems somehow, oh, immoral, I guess is the word. If you are at church anyway and meet a nice lady that's great but if you weren't there to see the light to begin with, it's a little creepy. The mall is good if you are 14 or a speed-walker. For now, I will bide my time, so if you see me in the produce aisle and it LOOKS like I'm buying lettuce, I probably am, but I'm also keeping my options open. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      It's getting to be about that time of year when young fancies turn to any number of wicked preoccupations that are not bad in and of themselves, but when entered into lightly can result in disaster. I'm talking about stepping over the threshold from childhood into college. When it comes to college, I preach abstinence. Get a library card and do it yourself. Save a buck or two. College is so completely different from what most high school kids and their parent think it is that I like to spend as much time as I can evangelizing against engaging in this deceptive enterprise lightly. At the very least, I encourage those interested in further schooling to do a serious check of themselves and their options. Whose to say a year working your way across Europe won't be a far superior learning experience? College looks cool and seems like the answer to life's problems, but "the media" have blown the importance of college way out of proportion. Everywhere you look it's college this and college that. "Girls Gone Wild" and "MTV's Spring Break."  In movies like "Animal House," "Oxford Blues," "PCU," "Back to School," "Van Wilder" and the classic "Up the Creek," college looks like one cool groove where the good times never end and a sweet career awaits those who hold out long enough against the evil dean of students to accidentally make that one connection while doing keg stands and beer bongs every weekend for five or six years to get the job of a lifetime. Of course, all of this applies more to state schools than your swanky private deals though I'm sure they party too. If you are of the lucky ones going to America's great universities - Harvard, Yale, Grinnell - then very little of this screed applies to you. But then very little of what applies to the common man will apply to the kind of people whose parents can afford to shuffle them off to private universities. It's nature's way and I have never claimed to be relevant to those kind of people unless they were trying to get back at their parents by hanging out with me. Now back to the plight of the working class in their vain attempt to better their lot in life through social climbing. College is fun and it can be a beautiful experience for the right people, but the problem is, no offense, everybody and his dog thinks college is the only thing that is going to save them from a lifetime of manual labor, deep frying and the slave-barge creak of cheap office chairs. Nothing the vast majority does will save you from the fate of the vast majority. Remember that. Going along with the crowd just makes you one of the sheep. You want to be a shepherd, you need a big, crooked stick and when people make fun of you for carrying a big, crooked stick, you have to look them in the eye and mean it when you say, "Don't be jealous of my big, crooked stick, you might have one some day, too." You must be able to get ahead of any problem and the only way to do that is with information. So here is some, ignore it at your peril. A college education is an oxymoron in many ways. It is hideously over-priced suggesting that it must be high in value yet it is insanely devalued by absolutely everyone in "the real world."  Here's why.  Everybody and his dog goes to college these days. Most get very little out of it, waste their time and money and get a meaningless piece of paper that should read "if you believe this guy is educated, you are stupider than he is." Employers know this and are not impressed with sheepskin. Incoming freshmen of questionable potential pack schools so tight, they often put the stragglers in temporary housing for as long as their entire freshman year. It is called temporary housing because there is no point in building permanent housing for a group that shrinks to half its size in 12 months.  They will still charge you to live with eight guys under the pinball machine, though thus proving you should have stayed home. Once the smarter kids decide to go back and live with mom and dad for another year or twelve, you can get a real room to skip class in. If you think your greatest problem is not being able to muddle through college, don't. Your greatest problem is that you will DEFINITELY be able to muddle through college, universities don't get paid if they kick you out for not hacking it. This further undermines the value of all diplomas. Employers know this too. Student loans are one of the greatest scams on earth. They allow people to borrow a sinful amount of money to pay for school before they are old enough to realize what a horrible mistake they are making.  People who have no meaningful concept of their own mortality can not be expected to have a meaningful concept of their own credit rating and should therefore not be allowed to take out education loans that will at best make them wage slaves for all eternity and at worst trash their credit rating when they graduate, fail to get that $50,000 first job and default on their loans because telemarketing won't pay the bills. So go to JuCo for a year or two, get the required stuff out of the way, save some money, learn the pains and joys of full-time employment, join the Army or the Peace Corps or anything.  Think before you leap. Get a taste of adulthood then go to college and lord it annoyingly over everybody. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Stick around, true believers. There should be something here for everyone even if you have never read comic books, been familiar with super heroes or followed the career of the amazing Spider-Man. By the time this column goes to press, we should all know whether or not the film version of "Spider-Man" is worth seeing or not. As I write this column, it is Friday morning and I doubt I will see "Spider-Man" until the lines shrink a bit. I am now at an age where few things are worth waiting in line for just so somebody can chatter behind me and kick my seat for two hours. It will certainly clean up at the box office either way.  In today's fast-paced world, a movie can be a god-awful waste of time and still make a killing on opening night, but fans are expecting a great deal from director Sam Raimi and well they should. The subject matter is important. That's right, I said important. What's so important about a guy who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and suddenly gains the ability to stick to walls? Put like that it sounds trivial. Anything sounds silly when you pick it apart. It's like asking what's so important about a carpenter with the ability to walk on water? It's all relative.  When it comes to good examples for us to live by, we can never have enough heroes. Spider-Man is one of those super heroes whose following is massive yet he has always fallen just short of capturing the popular imagination the way Superman and Batman do.  Spider-Man creator Stan Lee did one thing better than everyone when he spelled out this character's motivation, it's almost allegorical. Spider-Man represents what it means to be an ordinary person with an extraordinary gift. One line Stan "The Man" Lee wrote summed it up best whether we are talking about a comic book hero, a legend, a fairy tale or a parable. With great power comes great responsibility. Peter Parker, the boy who becomes Spider-Man, is initially uninterested in using his extraordinary new powers for anything more noble than impressing the ladies. It is his Uncle Ben who tells him he has an obligation to use his abilities to help other people. Peter blows this off and Uncle Ben is killed by a mugger Peter could have stopped on a previous occasion before the "great power" lecture.  It is a hard lesson but well-learned as the boy becomes a hero. What is so appealing about this message is it has deeper meaning than the obvious. Sure, we could all be heroes if we came from another planet, if a radioactive spider bit us or if a drunken monkey gave us three wishes.  But the simple truth beneath the bright colors and comic book fantasy is we all have some power and a responsibility to use it wisely for the good of everyone. It doesn't matter if you can't fly, make people tell the truth with your golden lariat, run faster than a train or shoot death beams out of your fingers. We all have something we can do. It doesn't need to be superhuman; being human is enough. It can be as simple as giving blood, making a phone call on behalf of a friend, giving your business to someone who deserves it, calling a tow truck for someone stuck in traffic, tipping your waitress, supporting free-range agriculture, recycling, doing the automobile repairs you should have done the first time and charging a fair price for them and then reconnecting all the little wires you disconnected in the first place, being honest, operating in good faith, taking pride in your community, letting someone else go first, reaching out to those who need it, being as polite to a clerk as you want them to be to you, giving your spare change to charity or being aware of how easy it is to make the world a better place one small act at a time. Larger than life figures make for good story-telling and they can set an example for us to follow. Sadly, most of them are made up, but fiction or not they give us a standard to live by. We need heroes to admire, but ordinary people like us should know above all else that, quietly and without fanfare, we can be heroes, too. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      If you were to grade the daily life experience, it would probably get about a C. The average day spent running higgledy-piggledy worrying about bills and working for someone else probably deserves a lower grade than that, but frankly, who wants to admit that their life gets less than a dead average? Of course, this all depends on the paradigm from which you operate. Keeping your head above water and sustaining one's existence as well as that of one's offspring could be considered an A+, but this is not "Up With People." Life is graded on a curve. Surviving gets a C. Living well gets extra credit. When I give out a high grade for a life experience, there has to be a good reason. If I give a meal an A, for instance, it will be because that food and drink could not be reasonably surpassed on any subjectively rational scale ... period.  I won't give an A because I am no longer hungry or because the quantities were such as to nearly cause distention. There is something to be said about never experiencing the better things in life, though. Once you have had a real bagel from a kosher bakery made by people who answer to a higher power, those soft dinner roll concoctions you get in some bakeries just make you angry. Once you've had genuine New York cheesecake so rich and dense it offends our Lord with it decadence, Jell-O instant cheesecake just feels morally wrong. As Americans, we have a strange tendency to eat all kinds of garbage. Fast food, preservatives, insane levels of sodium, fruit in heavy syrup, watered-down coffee, microwaved anything and everything.  It's like we have no idea what good is. Our pioneer forebears were happy to surive on anything and they passed that on to us. Forget about good FOR us, that went out the window so long ago it can't be measured without carbon dating. No, for the sake of this discussion, good food can be drenched in butter or, as the French call it, "cuisine." Nothing wrong with good pork fat, red meat, bacon, heavy cream. These are the foundations of high-quality fare. We aren't really consuming those things, either are we? Not the good varieties in any case. We defend our lousy lifestyle choices as if we were living il dulce vita though. It's one thing to kill yourself eating really good food, next to going out in flagrante dilecto, I can't think of a better way to go, but shoveling rendered swill down our gullets and chasing it with various colors of corn syrup in carbonated water is just cheap. If you're gonna die from clogged arteries, at least clog them with quality. But gravy from a can? Breaded, deep-fried cheese? Canned vegetables? I'm sorry if it offends, but there is no good reason in this day and age for anyone to eat a green bean from a can, even in the dead of winter, even in the comfort of one's home, let alone in a restaurant.  There are greenhouses, hydroponics, truck farms and frozen to consider first. Grow your own in a closet if need be but do not waste one more day eating green beans from a can. You deserve better than that. Convicted criminals deserve better than that. Restaurants should do better in any case, otherwise the only reason to eat out is a misplaced sense of pity. Feel your own plight, people, that's what I say. Tell your local eatery to do better or you'll stay home next Friday and eat canned veggies at cost. Since we are all so used to low standards, it is possible many of us just don't know what to avoid any more, so here are some questions you can ask yourself to determine if you are eating in a lousy restaurant. Is there more leather on your eggs than on your shoes? Do you feel lucky when your dinner salad has a tomato on it?  Did the waitress punish you for asking what kind of salad dressings they had by drowning your icerberg lettuce in Dorothy Lynch? That was no accident. Is the only reason your medium steak isn't bleeding all over your plate because it's still frozen in the middle? Is the menu you're reading AT LEAST 20-years old? Does your cook wear sweatpants? Do you think to yourself, "well, at least there's a lot of it?" Ever get the feeling the special is just an excuse to serve the same thing every Tuesday? Does a sign on the wall state proudly "we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason?" When you ask the waitress if the pasta is al dente, does she say "I think he doesn't work here any more." Are the lumps in your instant potatoes put there to fool you into thinking they are "old-fashioned?" Can you see the bottom of your coffee cup when it's full? Can anything on your sandwich be described as "reconsituted?" If your answer to two or more of the above questions is "yes," then chances are you can do better. Life is too short to eat garbage, so treat yourself right and if you have to stay home to do that then so be it. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Today's column is a rant at DefCon level three. It's a mid-level spiel where five represents absolute fluff and one is the equivalent of thermonuclear tantrum. If I were to color code this column, I would have to give it kind of an orangeish/burnt sienna hew. So fair warning if you don't like to see people get all excited, turn away now. Ready? Wednesday night, I was cruising the "local" television news channels for mention of a young black girl from Kirn Junior High School girl whose locker was vandalized with profanity and epithets by slack-jawed racists who should be hunted down and rooted out of the Council Bluffs Public School system like the poisonous boll weevils they are. I will not repeat their pin-headed, hate-soaked scribblings, it was the standard backwoods Neanderthal fare one expects from genetically-deficient bigots. Though I should apologize to Neanderthals because all evidence suggests they were smarter than this. I won't, but I will acknowledge how cool 13-year-old Danyelle Lippert was for deciding to go back to school the next day to show everyone what a tough, smart Council Bluffs girl looks like. Good for you, Danyelle. I for one am glad to count you among the number of C.B.'s finer residents and I know too that many C.B. citizens, the one's who can actually stand upright, are equally proud of you. You are not alone so never surrender. Rumor had it that one or two of the Omaha TV stations had been to Kirn after the Nonpareil's intrepid school reporter Paula Beebe and her flouncy sidekick Courtney Brummer.  So there I was switching back and forth between one story about swans eating Christmas lights in a park to another about the vague connection between the World Trade Center and the company hired to light the new First National Building wondering what kind of treatment this story was going to get.  It is a widely held belief among Council Bluffs residents that only the worst possible view of our city is ever given attention by our good neighbors and a hate crime at a junior high school surely qualified as the worst.  This story did not make the TV news and I was not sure whether to be relieved as a C.B. resident that my city was not made a goat over the issue while the Nonpareil had the story or to be offended that the issue was, by some rationale, deemed less important than swans eating Christmas lights in a park. Here is where the real rant begins.  A Council Bluffs story did make the Channel 7 broadcast Wednesday night. One of our own, Marla Camerlinck, was so upset that our public library allowed her son to check out "American Beauty," an R-rated film, that she just had to get on an Omaha television station to make sure that all parents who are too lazy to go to the library with their kids know of this shocking state of affairs. Marla said she thought her 13-year-old son was supposed to be at the library "to learn ... not to learn how to have sex," which I would describe as merely another kind of learning, but I digress. Oh, where to start. First off Marla, any 13-year-old who HAS to learn about sex from a movie because he hasn't had "the talk" yet has bigger problems than watching a movie for grownups. Even without movies, there are books, National Geographic Magazines and my favorite growing up, the Sears catalog. I grew up in a moral household isolated from the sins of the world with no cable OR a library card and still managed to figure out more about sex than appears in "American Beauty" by the time I was 12. This issue is not about your kids mind being poisoned, Ms. Camerlinck. This issue is about making your hometown look foolish. To start with, the world is not designed to make your job as a parent effortless. Every indication of sex in the world is not necessarily evil and our library IS a place of learning. Great films are a part of that process. If you had watched "American Beauty" with your kid you would have seen how advanced its multi-layered narrative structure and symbolic depiction of American culture through the eyes of diverse characters at odds with each other as well as themselves really is instead of jsut being shocked at the big "R" on the back of the tape.  Omaha TV stations will jump at any chance they get to come into our town to make us all look like a bunch of wicked, backward hayseeds who sit around stupefied and perplexed, pondering in our filth, hoisted on the petard of our own immorality.  People like Marla Camerlinck are willing and eager to appear on camera and make fools of themselves rather than attach a note to a library card. They make it easy for our friends across the river to do their nasty, little stories on us thus humiliating and degrading all of the good and moral people of Council Bluffs including a certain 13-year-old boy whose mommy went on TV because he might see a nipple. Omaha TV stations will always carry these stories, especially with May sweeps coming up. Stories demonizing Council Bluffs make Omahans feel better about living in a third-rate Cleveland that's only claim to fame is meat they don't produce, their many telemarketing firms and the record number of over-the-road truck drivers who call Omaha home. Do yourselves a favor, folks, and think about how bad you make us all look before you take your troubles across the river to get on the TV, 'kay? - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      It's 4/20, y'all - I got love. At least that's what Snoop Dogg said about this day of the calendar. I'm not exactly sure why, but it has something to do with hydroponic grow lights. I guess Snoop is an amateur horticulturalist. OK, that's not true. I know full well what Snoop meant when he referred to 420, it's pot smoker's Christmas. I cannot afford to be too naive in my line of work though naivete is supposed to be a sign of our purity and innocence, isn't it? Light and dark. In life as in art, is how we see literally and figuratively. How could I not know what 420 is? I went to college half my life after all, and if you aren't going to learn about all the bizarre pop culture/hipster/druggie/hip-hop references hanging out in a newsroom full of 18-22-year-olds, then not only are you NOT trying, you are walking around with blinders on. The date, 4/20, is not significant on its own, but 420 is some kind of police code in certain regions of the country for marijuana possession.  Hence, high schoolers who engage in this behavior might say to one another, "excuse me, old bean, shall we meet after school to practice our various sporting interests at say, oh, I don't know, 4:20?" They then might snigger in glee that their inside joke went unnoticed. Of course, 420 is also a kind of a joke among fans of many acts that promote and glorify marijuana the way the Three Stooges promoted pie-flinging and physical abuse. Cypress Hill make no bones about their pot use and get almost as much comedy mileage out of such songs as "Hits from a Bong" as Cheech and Chong got from "Up in Smoke." Of course, besides alcohol, pot and Whippits, drugs really aren't that funny and we should all take the subject quite seriously, shouldn't we?  I don't want to get all negative or anything 'cause Lord knows nobody likes it when I take things to the dark side, but occasionally we need people capable of walking in the dark and the light to give us an honest look at what's happening in our community so we can be informed and perhaps do something about "the way things are."  So here's an opininion from the dark side: I'm sick of living in a town where it's raining tweakers. Maybe I just notice these people more than others do, but I can't go anywhere without seeing tweakers. At the grocery store, driving down the street, watching a movie ... tweakers, tweakers, tweakers. "Tweakers" are people whose drug of "choice" is meth. You can always, and I do mean ALWAYS, tell when somebody is tweakING. They act like they just drank a whole pot of coffee for the first time in their lives. They're anxious, they don't sleep, their eyes dart around, they can't sit still and they will not shut up. Most of the time they look like they haven't showered in weeks or don't know what a washcloth is. They are twitchy, unpredictable and dangerous. Remember the last time you were enjoying a skillet at Village Inn and some chick came in with messed up teeth and greasy hair? She kept chattering with anybody who would give her a minute, turning around in her booth to complain about how her boyfriend just left her in the parking lot then changed her order five times and kept trying to pass all this off as being sociable? That was a tweaker. Took me some time to figure it out, but now I just don't give people the benefit of the doubt, if it looks like a tweaker, twitches like a tweaker and won't shut up like a tweaker, it's a tweaker and I move on.  Last time I said hating people because of their race was wrong because there are so many good reasons to hate others? Well, tweaking is an example of a good reason to hate others.  They do this drug that makes them unbearable in every conceiveable way, they get addicted, then they start stealing to support their habit and committing other various and sundry crimes associated with not being able to sit still after being awake for three days. Give me some laid back, giggly potheads any day. Some unemployed college student high on weed trips into a restaurant, you can trust that. It's almost reassuring and comfortable like a Norman Rockwell painting these days. That kid on weed just wants a Denver omelet, cheese fries, chicken fried steak, pie, ice cream and the biggest glass of chocolate milk you've ever seen. He isn't dangerous. Tweakers, on the other hand. They add to the disquiet and danger in our community. Drugs are common. Why? Basically, people will do anything to get high and yeah, I'm looking at you Mr. and Mrs. Bud Light Cigarette Smokin' Coffee Drinker. Legal they may be but caffeine, nicotine and alcohol are drugs so use that insight to figure out people who do drugs you disapprove of. If the film "Traffic" showed us anything it is that as long as there is money to made supplying people with their particular fix, we will have a drug problem. Outlaw sugary snacks and you will create another industry for criminals to get rich on as they find new ways to sell stronger and more addictive forms of sugar. You know there is something wrong with the world when you look back on a time when pot was about all you had to worry about as the good old days. It's time to out-think the problem of drugs because it will keep on trucking, you can count on that. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      I have so far avoided comment on the recent scandals in the Catholic Church regarding the sexual abuse of children. To me, it is an open and shut case. Child abuse should not be tolerated by anyone for any reason and whether it happens in the Catholic Church or at a local, municipal youth center, it is equally of concern to society at large. Catholic or not, these children are our responsibility. Every Catholic columnist under the sun has sounded off with opinions on how many good priests there still are doing good work who don't deserve this stigma to calls for sweeping reform on abstinence and women in the priesthood. To me, priests are guys who work in a field I have little to do with and I would be as loathe to condems all for the actions of a few. As for letting them get married or be women, that's Catholic business and they can do what they want, it's their religion. If people don't like it, they can change it or quit. So long as it doesn't affect my life or secular society in any way shape or form, have at it. Raped kids? Attempts to keep the scandal quiet? Shifting blame? Blaming American culture, morality and homosexuals? Well, these things make it everyone's issue, so let's get started. I would expect some of this behavior from a corporation, not a group that professes a clear moral imperative. I feel sorry for Pope John Paul II. This is a lot to handle at his age and in his condition. His tenure over a good portion of Christendom has been fairly wise if not progressive, though. He seems like a good guy, but American secular society does not need his validation that what these priests did was a crime. We know that.  Perhaps it was not the Pope's intention on Tuesday during his meeting with the American Cardinals to give that impression, but when we consider the actions taken by Boston's Cardinal Law to keep the crimes of at least one priest quiet while moving him from one position to the next, there was obviously an attitude that these problems could be handled "in house." What audacity. I don't care if you are a Catholic cardinal, corporate CEO or federal undersecretary of transportation, there are certain moral issues so central to what it means to be a decent human being that regardless of religious affiliation, socioeconomic class or career path standing by and doing nothing is unforgivable. Covering up a child sex crime is criminal facilitation. I feel pretty safe in saying that. Cardinal Law refuses to resign and the scuttlebutt from an unnamed cardinal quoted in the Los Angeles Times is that members of the current convention in Rome are going to push the Vatican to force Law out for his failure. I hope it is for his failure and not spin control. How long has this current crisis been going on now, a couple of months? Why is Law even still walking around free let alone taking a defiant stance? If I were Law, I wouldn't be worried about my job, I'd be worried about my soul burning in hell. I wouldn't be thinking about the best way to keep my job, I'd be thinking about the best way to atone for my egregious sins up to and including what the Japanese refer to as taking the honorable way out. Meanwhile, back in Gotham City, New York's Monsignor Eugene Clark, preaching at St. Patrick's Cathedral blamed homosexuality and American culture calling the United States "probably the most immoral country in the Western Hemisphere." What exactly is the basis for that comment? Speaking of shifting the blame. Marianne Duddy, executive director of the gay Catholic advocacy group Dignity/USA, in response to Clark's slander, called his words "very irresponsible." "I think that most Catholics see this for what it is - an attempt to deflect attention away from the horrible mishandling of the situation by church officials and the decades of cover-up that have been engaged in," she said. Good point, glad she said it. The archdiocese of New York, faster than you can say "Rome, we have a problem," cut this high ranking representative off from the pack by releasing a statement assuring everyone that his words were merely personal opinion and not official doctrine in spite of being made behind an altar.  Clark later guesstimated that 3 percent of all U.S. clergyman have this predilection toward abusing children because of dirty images in the media. Wow, two birds with one stone. Good shot, Monsignor, but the world is supposed to be full of temptation. Isn't half the point of this experiment to overcome temptation? According to Clark's shotgun blast, all religions have this problem and its the media that's to blame. If I were a cleric in any of these religions about now, I'd be a tad offended at this baseless attempt to deflect attention away from teh church by dragging religion as a whole through the muck with made up numbers. Did Gallup do a poll I'm not aware of? It is not right to try and make this a "gay problem" either. By this year of our Lord 2002, there are very few people who do not have at least one gay relative, friend, teacher, coworker or acquaintance who prove every day pedophilia and homosexuality are not linked. My gay friends never wrangled with the moral questions surrounding Natalie Portman, Britney Spears or other teen sex idols, they liked adults quite clearly. Demonizing and scapegoating homosexuals is a giant step backward for moral authority. And here we are talking about issues not directly related to the subject at hand again, which is the whole point of scapegoating. Here is the heart of the matter to me. Bad things are going to happen, no one denies that. I bet the vast majority of priests do great service to their communities and bring great honor to their profession. But when bad things happen, it is nice to know someone in charge will do their best to make it right. That is all anybody of any faith asks of their spiritual leaders. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      I cannot remember a time when Israel was not making the news with its conflicts and scaring holy hell out the entire world. The Middle East conflict has far too much control over the fate of our planet. It is a morass we cannot escape. I am pretty sure most people know next to nothing about the subject because the subject is so complex even experts lose track. So this is a briefing for those who always wanted to know about Israel but were afraid to ask. It is basic, but you can get the advanced version 24 hours day on CNN.  Most of my information in this column comes from two sources, Dr. Joel Moses of Iowa State and a summary on the history of the region from Newsweek. Dr. Moses taught a wicked class on Israel and the Middle East at Iowa State that was so full of facts, I was lucky to pass at all. Though it might be hard to tell by his name, Dr. Moses is a member of the tribe of Israel, he is an expert on the region and was never the least bit biased on the subject. Israel is one country with two distinct histories, - one Jewish and one Arabic - neither history tells the whole truth and neither side gives much credence to the other.  To truly understand Israel and Palestine, one would have to go back to where the modern problem gathered steam and that is with Romans who occupied Judea along with the rest of the Mediterranean. Left on their own, Jews would nearly tear themselves apart with infighting. Even today, arguments about national policy and who counts as Jewish keep tensions among Israelis high. If it weren't for being in the middle of the Arab world, they would be free to argue these fine points.  Even in ancient times, only an outside force like the Romans could keep Jews focused and united.  Jews made life tough on the Romans so the Romans tried to solve their own crisis in the Middle East by scattering rebellious Judeans all over the empire in the belief that once these people melted into the local population, they would cease to exist. These Jews were known as the Diaspora and what the Romans did not count on was the strength of Jews to persist as a culture and the power of Judaism as a religion to bind them. Rather than melt away, Jews simply adapted. Anti-Semitism was prevalent in many countries where Jews settled because Jews were viewed as alien. Back in Palestine, there were still plenty of Jews to keep the home fires burning, but eventually the region became more Arabic and Muslim than Jewish in race and religion.  Fast forward to the 20th century, many Jews, tired of oppression throughout the world, but mostly in Europe, resettled in Palestine in the '20s and '30s. It was not until the Holocaust that the world really got behind the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. And why not? It seemed like a solution, Palestine is where Jews came from so why not just make it a modern country?  Well, there were a great many Palestinians living there who felt their claim on land they had occupied for a couple thousand years was valid.  In 1948, the United Nations divvied up Palestine much to the chagrin of 700,000 Arabs who were displaced by the creation of the state of Israel and that is only the official number. The Arab world is not about to forgive being carved up by Western nations.  Feeling they had the right to defend themselves, Arabs invaded Israel on the grounds that the U.N. did not have the right to displace Arabs from Palestine. They lost and they were not happy about that, but they planned to come back another day.  So ended Israel's war of independence and so began the war of ideas that is Israel and the Middle East, but it gets worse. In 1967, Israel felt threatened by Egypt, a country that was threatening Israel but had not attacked as such.  Israel struck first and to the amazement of everyone managed to not only fight off the Arab forces but captured the Sinai Desert and Gaza Strip from Egypt, East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. This territory added to Israel's security because each one is easier to defend than the original borders. Israel opened settlements in these occupied territories to secure their claim and add to their national defense. This is problematic because even the U.N. has called "no fair" on Israel and suggested that giving up these territories would be in the best interest of peace in that region.  Israel is not about to give up these territories and its security in spite of the fact that many of those displaced Palestinians from 1948 live in these territories.  This is the heart of the matter and where the propaganda machine gets fired up hard and heavy on both sides. One side's armed action is another side's terrorist act. Both sides are equally offended by this notion.  There are thousands of factors that can be added to this basic outline of the problem from ancient tribal history to oil dependency and the effect of World War II on the region to media bias, Islamic extremism, 9-11, influence peddling and more.  This should be enough to make the reports on television more understandable, but this is and always has been a thicket that is likely to prick us all before its done. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      The great philosopher and mid-'80s stand-up comedian Emo Phillips once said, "Why hate other people because of their race when there are so many GOOD reasons to hate others?" Like most good comedy, there is something profound about this statement that gives one pause. This was about the only great thing Emo Phillips ever said before he disappeared, but one really good thought per career or lifetime is better than most people manage.  I've had reason of late to consider those words and the subject of hate. I will not go into great detail about who I've met who said what about whom when I was at the grocery store, the mall, the gas station, the drive-thru, the bookstore, the university, et cetera, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.  Hate is common, pervasive, casual and always justified by something. If it isn't some clerk commenting out of the side of his mouth about "a member of our town's Hispanic community" who can't find the ketchup, it's a cop blithely using the term "Counciltucky" (a firing offense in my opinion) to describe all the "white trash" in his district or it could be an otherwise upstanding member of our city's professional "class" ranting about how unlike "us" Arabs are. I call B.S. on all of that.  You can dress it up however you want. You can make it a joke, call it your opinion or claim it is the well-considered fruit of your greater geopolitical knowledge, but hate is hate. The problem is not WHO you hate, it is THAT you hate. Don't believe me? Ask God. I am not a very religious man. I make no apologies for remaining unaffiliated although I did dabble briefly in Catholicism around the false millennium of 2000.  I have always believed religion and spirituality were two issues that intersected. Combine the fact that I would be afraid to pick the "wrong" religion, denomination, sect or cult with the fact that I am more or less agnostic and you get a pretty clear picture of where I stand on religion and why. But the vast majority of mankind is affiliated with one religion or another. at least they claim to believe in God. Not just A God, but THE God, the SAME God - granted with slightly different prophets, messages, powers inclinations and chosen people, but basically the same God.  I've seen very few religions outside of "Conan" novels that did not promote love and peace as virtues. Likewise, I've seen very few religions escape the inevitable twisting of God's words to justify hate.  Love your neighbor. Love your enemy. It's pretty straight forward and universal. Yet, I've seen few religions that did not have those hangers-on who could take decent philosophies and twist them for their own agendas. This should just help illustrate how universal much of the human experience is. Most people know enough to be ashamed of their hate, which is why they dress it up or hide it. There is something to be said in favor of blatant racists. At least they aren't hiding anything. When a guy is shouting epithets and slandering entire groups of people loudly and proudly, he shows the world how ugly and ignorant he is allowing them the opportunity to avoid him. In my experience, the best cure for racism is exposure. As much as students and faculty complained about Iowa State being so terribly, terribly white (another subtle form of "legitimized" racism I call "OK to hate white folks"), it was a great place to meet people from all over the world and I'm glad I did. Really getting to know people from different countries makes  two things obvious to you. One is that the vast majority of mankind is made up of absolute sweethearts. It's true.  I can go through an entire list of the people I've met from different countries of different races who subscribed to different religions who were so kind, considerate and all-around good they made me weep thinking about what a bad person I am.  Koreans, Malaysians, Africans, Arabs, Jews, Indians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Colombians,  Pakistanis, Chinese, Japanese, Irishmen, Belgians, English, Germans, Hungarians, Australians, Canadians and even Frenchmen have all crossed my path and impressed me with something they should never have needed to prove to me - their humanity. People are good and the only way to know that is to go out and meet them because it is harder than hell to hate a whole group of people once you get to few of them. With that said, you cannot teach diversity in the schools. Diversity cannot be learned, it has to be experienced and trying to teach people how they should feel and act toward others is futile and ultimately does more harm than good. Meet people, learn about them, hang out, do whatever it takes to really get to know them and you will find it impossible to hate them just for their race.  Like Emo said, race is ultimately one of the lamest reasons to hate others. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Recently, I have been reacquainted with a favorite, old TV show through the auspices of the modern cable television system. It was a highly popular early-'90s Canadian thriller about a Toronto cop wrestling with the moral, ethical and intellectual conundrums of working homicide on the night shift in the surprisingly clean yet technically gritty streets of a modern Canadian city. Oh, and he's a vampire trying to become human again, but that does not interfere with his ability to "get the job done." The show is "Forever Knight" and I cannot for the life of me understand why I ever got so into it except at the time there was nothing else on. Canadian television is by and large pretty bland and even the best of shows have all the flavor of an all-u-can-eat lutefisk buffet. Plus I've never understood what was so funny about "Newfie" jokes. Perhaps I was intellectually enthralled by the concept of a vampire cop. I mean, besides the drinking blood and being damned issues to cope with there are the technical challenges of avoiding the sun, crosses, garlic and long-term relationships. Let's face it, being a modern vampire is a pretty sexy option for a bachelor.  The flashbacks to previous centuries alone would be almost worth the risk of bursting into flames on the beach. Other than that it's "dressed to the nines and feelin' fine." Ann Rice is rich for a reason. Maybe it's the power of the box this stuff came through. U2, the super rich and popular Irish pop rock band all the 30 to 40-year-old kids are talking about, once conducted a little experiment on their ZooTV Tour. Lead singer, world famous political activist and dynamic frontman Bono postulated that even though concert-goers had paid big bucks to see one of the most popular rock and proselytizing acts the world, nay, the universe has ever seen, every member of the audience would still find their attention drawn to the Jumbotron television screens set up behind the band. Of course, it worked. It was a bold experiment with no control subject, just another mad scientist gig rockin' the house from Munich to Paris to New York to Los Angeles with one inexplicable stopover in Ames, Iowa.  Coincidence?! I doubt it. Is it a coincidence that Ames is at the center of a biotechnology and agribusiness revolution? Is it a coincidence that Ames has the best drinking water and the hottest coeds since "Girls Gone Wild IV." Not bloody likely. Not even Bono himself has been able - or is it willing? -  to explain all these threads. He was, however, quick to point out what most people knew, that even though they were at this "totally awesome concert, dude" they kept watching whatever was on the TV screens though there was no sound and it was only local broadcast programming. So what is the theory here? Does TV ensnare us with its hypno-rays? Are we mercilessly trapped by its voodoo?  I don't know the scientific term, but yes. Let's face it, many of us have been watching "ER" on NBC for a long, long time. A long, long, LONG time.  If hard-pressed, could even the greatest "ER" fan explain what has happened on the show since it started some 20 or 30 years ago? I could come up with maybe half a page of stuff - random plotlines, vague rivalries, occasional high/low points - but right now I couldn't tell you the names of half the characters let alone explain why I come back every Thursday to see the same emergency medical procedures I saw five years ago. We tend to blame a lot of things on the old TV as though your more stimulating programs have the ability to twist our minds with their sex and violence. Perhaps that's true. Frankly, I have begun to consider that TV may be a more accidentally insidious invention than most of us realize because of the almost complete lack of stimulation it provides. TV is a drug. We may not pop it, shoot it, smoke it or put just a pinch of it between our cheek and gums, but TV stops the brain working faster than an opium high ball with a Demerol chaser.  Are you addicted? Can you turn it off? Do you find yourself talking about it at work or at parties? Is it the only thing you have in common with some people? Do you get cranky when you miss your shows? Do the people on TV seem like friends? Have you bought newer and bigger sets over the years though the old ones work fine? Do you have as many TVs as people in your house? Do you zone out while watching? If you ever get the chance, watch yourself watching TV sometime. Videotape yourself watching three hours - even three GOOD hours - of TV. Then some night when the TV watching is so bad you have a half hour to kill pop that tape in and watch yourself. Fast forward to the good bits. Heck, fast forward for the entire three hours and watch you and your family barely move, speak or think all night long like the whole house is on Thorazine. Then ask yourself what the most dangerous drug in America might really be.  Gotta go, "Star Trek" is on. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Council Bluffs own 89.7 The River is doing a bit of fundraising this week so I thought as a former Iowa State DJ and current fan of college radio, I would take a minute to plug my favorite radio station. Don't worry it won't hurt. Or will it?  Then I will get knee deep into a subject that is so depraved, so disturbing you will not be able to turn away. Read on ... if you dare. Iowa Western has been impressing me lately. In my ignorant youth - and isn't youth mostly about ignorance? - I used to call IWCC K-Mart U., Wild Western or the high school after high school.   Between The River and the newly revamped channel 17/CBTV coming to a cable line-up near you, I have to give mad, phat props out to this fine institution and its communications program that seems to be on par with some major universities. I know it has Iowa State beat. Our much hated former president Martin Jischke took it upon himself to sell our television station out from under us and the ISU student radio station was pretty much a bunch of jackass kids who took great glee in pushing the vulgarity envelope between songs broadcast almost to the edge of campus. I will probably still call IWCC K-Mart U. and Wild Western, but now I will do it with love and respect. How often does any college radio station get to dominate the local market the way The River does? The best part of this station for listeners is NO COMMERCIALS. You tune in to The River and you actually get to hear music without the interference of cheesy, locally produced ads for car dealerships that blow you right out of the car and have you singing jingles until madness sets in. When you call The River with a request, you get the DJ who will play your song if they've got it. There are no major telecommunications companies telling River DJs to play N'Sync and Britney Spears every 15 minutes and not John Lennon. If you want local music, they've got that too. The River is also Council Bluffs one best shot at true respect in the metro. It's been voted favorite radio station in the metro for the last two years and it is dominating the ratings. Plus we don't have have to worry about them picking up and moving across The River across the river the way other stations have in the past. I've said it before and I'll say it again, media is what make a city. Media give a city its voice and personality and as long as any city is dependent on another for its news, local programming and radio, it looks and feels like a seccond class burg. The flip side of this is River radio goodness is they have to do fund raising - a small price for quality. They do seem to have fun with it.  That enormous radio tower The River uses to broadcast all the way to Lincoln costs a bit to keep up. So if you are a River radio listener tune in then call in a pledge. If you are lucky, you can get one of the college kids to perform some bizarre stunt like shaving his entire body or singing "Let's Do It" for 20 bucks. With CBTV on the horizon, it just feels good to finally get some local media built up in this town. I am hoping to get my own TV show one day called "What the hell are you looking at?" where I walk around town asking people of all creeds and variety the important questions of the day like "what the hell are you looking at?"  The camera would follow me as I got into fights from the CAF museum to the Mall of the Bluffs to the Ameristar parking lot. A real rating booster. It wouldn't really be that different from my average day accept for the camera man. And now, as promised, the gripping conclusion to this Wednesday's exciting column.  I always had a great fear of basements ever since I was a kid. Not the smooth finished basement with the rec room, but the kind of old basements we have in town here where the concrete floor was more of an afterthought and around each corner was a shadow blacker than pitch. Dirt-floored basements are the worst. What secrets do they hide?  In my current abode, strange sounds like tortured spirits can be heard at all hours, but mostly every night at 3 a.m. I never drink water before going to bed in case I might have to get up in the middle of the night and hear what I casually refer to as the sounds of the damned reaching out to eat my soul. It's quite, quite maddening. In the middle of my basement is a hold nearly three feet deep and 8 feet wide. Inside the hole are thousands of white painted pine cones. No one knows how they got there or why they keep coming back night after night no matter how many times they are removed and no matter how many times the hole is filled in. Well, later. - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer. His column runs on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      I was recently reminded of just how difficult it is to run a city. Two weeks ago, I bought "Sim City 3000 Unlimited" for the old computer. Since that fateful day, I have spent every waking hour devoted to the pursuit of making Ho Chi Greg City a Pacific paradise.  I have laid every inch of pipe that can be laid on that island. I built the schools, roads, police stations, firehouses, lured industry and commerce all while keeping the environment in mind. When my residents dedicated a statue in honor of Jerrett-san, a single tear of joy escaped from my eye as I realized it had  been worth the sacrifice I had put into this city of approximately 70,000 residents (give or take 5,000 depending on if the UFOs have attacked recently). It is hard building a city and making it last because everything looks rosy early on. You set up shop and people come running. A little civilization is better than nothing.   As the years roll on, people get greedy and complacent. Things become more complicated. Crime rates increase, educational needs change. Once supportive and proud citizens become spiteful and disloyal. You open a road to your neighbor to aid commerce and 25 percent of your population moves to the big city. When does the hurting stop? Never. Frankly, being a mayor is a tough gig. I spent a good deal of time this week on another tough gig and that was looking into the history of Council Bluffs for our upcoming Visions of the Past special sections.  It promises to be an eye-opener to many who are unfamiliar with our history. Why is our history so downplayed? Are our lives so full we don't need it? Has the past has been made irrelevant? No way, pal. No matter how far we think we've gone beyond our past, it is still important. How can we be expected to live up to the examples set by our ancestors if we don't even know who our ancestors were? How can we avoid the pitfalls of ages gone by if we ignore them? DeLong, Mynster, Marks, Bregant, Bayliss, Dodge, DeSmet, Young. All names that should mean something to every living soul who ever walked the streets of Council Bluffs. History is a touchy subject with me. Not world history, not the history of Western Civilization, but the history of our town because I learned next to nothing of it in school. Buttloads of American history were to be had. I remember thinking about how cool just about every other part of the country was but ours. Maybe once or twice a history teacher would mention Council Bluffs used to be a place people drove through to go someplace cool like California. No context, no perspective. Just the idea. If you want a good life kid, you better follow those people. If I were discover now that an entire week of my primary education was ever spent on local history, I would drop dead immediately from shock. As a result of this oversight, I have pretty much wandered about in the wilderness wondering who I am and where I come from and I am not alone. Growing up, if you wanted C.B. history, you had to go get it from the library and most kids don't go a-learnin' all on their own. We assumed there was nothing to know about our city any way. How wrong we were.  Local history should not be optional, it should not be a hobbyist's pursuit or the fascination of the eccentric. Our history should be ingrained in us. It should be that one thing we take with us no matter where we go. This is not just a message for Council Bluffs, but the whole state of Iowa. If we want to keep people who were born and raised here from leaving, we need to give them an incentive. They have to know they have a future here, but just as important, they need to know they have a past here as well. Our predecessors walked the earth like hairy-faced giants in bulky overcoats and stovepipe hats. They carried the weight of westward expansion on their gnarled shoulders. They built this city on rock and roll, intestinal fortitude and maybe just a little gambling. They laid the tracks that stretched from here into the future with their bare hands.  In old photos, the men look stern, staunch and determined. The women of the past had wide, child-bearing hips and iron constitutions. They could feed and clothe 12 kids of their own plus any neighbor kids whose parents happened to die of cholera or diphtheria. They baked bread, tended the chickens, milked the cows and still had the inclination to charitable works in their "spare time." In old photos, they possess a beauty no makeup could improve and sport expressions that explain why the men were so stern, staunch and determined. In many ways, our town has fallen. I may act like a booster most times, but I'm not some fool blind to reality. There is less to do here now than there was during the Great Depression when Playland and Manawa were really jumping.  I am not an optimist, but neither am I a pessimist. I am pragmatic most of the time. Still, I believe in the ability of 60,000 or so people at any given time to improve their lot in life and pay homage to the greatness of their communal past by continuing to build their future.  - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Early this month, two Council Bluffs firefighters were fired for crossing the line of good taste while playing practical jokes on each other at the firehouse. As reported by the Nonpareil's Courtney Brummer (our version of Lois Lane), firefighters David Pryor and Michael Haase were fired for making a sign that "depicted a sexual invitation" and placing that sign on a co-workers personal vehicle. The sign was brought inside the firehouse after it was noticed by another firefighter and apparently no one involved was particularly offended. But the [explitive deleted] hit the fan. It would be difficult for the public to weigh in on this issue without knowing exactly what the sign said and this is an issue the public may want to sound off about. You are dying to know what the sign said as much as I am dying to tell you. Many publications will quote vulgarity when it is pertinent, but it is the position of the Nonpareil and other socially-responsible newspapers that bad words should not appear in print because there are still a couple of people in the world who still get the vapors when they see cussin' in print. I got over the shock at Kirn where I pretty much heard everything by 10:30 the first morning of seventh grade. No one who reads the Nonpareil is familiar with vulgarity, so it would be pointless to reprint them anyway.  For the sake of being informed, let's see how close I can come to conveying the essential message without sending anyone into shock. Turn away if you are sensitive to highly edited phrases, but if you are going to read, please sit down first.  The sign in question said "I want to [verb] a black man's [noun]." Take a second to recover, then come back. Now, we all know we live in a country hell bent on severe punishment. We like to electrocute schizophrenics, try 15-year olds as adults and report our neighbors to the FBI for flying Italian flags. We like our justice hard and fast. It keeps ne'er-do-wells in line or so we think. Such is the case here. Frankly, I don't think the verb and noun portions of this sign are all that offensive. It's vulgar sure, but that is not really a firing offense in and of itself, surely. On the first offense?  Calling what men do willingly "sexual harassment" is a bit strong. The problem to me is no one seems to have had a problem with the "black man's" part, just the sexual connotation.   Most of the defense for these guys focuses on the need to blow off steam. Granted, go blow off steam, but not at the expense of putting casual hateful stereotypes out on display. I don't believe these guys are racists, but comments like this are hurtful. With that said, I don't think Pryor and Haase should have been fired. They should get their jobs back. If these guys are decent firefighters and their only offense was this kind of behavior, then they should be punished some other way. Firefighting is a tough job. There is a lot of down time and when the call comes in, chances are there is going to be some real ugliness on the scene. Most of us don't like to go to funerals where death is wearing makeup and a good suit. Few of us could look at death on the scene in all its brutal reality and keep it together.  Fear of fire is elemental and primal yet firefighters face those fears to save lives. Do they get high-spirited when they get back to the firehouse? I hope so, for their sakes and ours. The last thing we need are firefighters so stressed out they can't do their jobs or, worse still, quit. I hate to resort to cliches like "boys will be boys." That is far too often used to excuse behavior that should not be.  Two things I know are true is guys make each other miserable for fun. Pranks and put-downs are the light and healthy side of this expression. It is how we determine amongst ourselves who has the bigger [metaphor]. My best friends and I routinely refer to each other by epithets once commonly reserved for only the most hated in society. It's how we say, "hey, if I really hated you, I wouldn't even talk to you, [expletive deleted]." If I can get away with putting a sign on my buddy's car with his cell phone number that says "Call me for free [sexual invitation]," that's just hilarious. With that said, keep Pryor and Haase around, but let's maybe have them understand that there are lines that should not be crossed and one of those lines is writing "black man's [noun]" on a sign that will be seen by the public. Black members of the public. Little old ladies. Kids who haven't started seventh grade at Kirn yet. Clergy. We like to trash on political correctness these days. Some people equate disdain for PC speech with saying whatever hateful, bigoted thing they can think of. If you think insulting entire races of people makes you an enlightened thinker, you've missed the point.  Where I come from, it is still considered rude to use bad language that insults entire groups. Because it is wrong, sure, but also because what comes around goes around.  Pryor and Haase probably weren't trying to hurt anyone with their joke so I say keep them around so long as they understand how they crossed the line. Maybe they could explain it to a local meeting of the NAACP or talk to high school kids about playing nice.  Let them explain why "black man's [noun]" makes the joke funnier in their minds. That would not only be a learning experience for Pryor and Haase, but it would also make them the butt of their own prank and isn't that the best joke of all? - Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      A recent study at the University of California-San Francisco suggests that low cholesterol levels can aid brain functions. A study of 1,037 post-menopausal women showed that cognitive problems were twice as likely subjects with high cholesterol as opposed to those with low cholesterol. Yeah, that's helpful. This is practically meaningless since cholesterol levels, by being controlled at least partially by lifestyle choices, could also reflect any number of other factors like education, socio-economic status, religious restrictions, cultural preferences. By being partially innate, cholesterol levels can be affected by race, gender and genetics. The next step will be for someone to begin production on a slew of cholesterol reducing products and exercise machines. The point is, we are constantly bombarded with claims. Some have merit and some don't. How do you tell the difference? Claims with little merit sound about as reasonable as those with a great deal. These claims seem like they want a better, healthier America, but I am doubtful. The goal seems to be feeding the health, exercise and diet industries while keeping the average American in good enough working order to be productive. Not creative, happy or satisfied, just productive. When it comes to our health, Americans tend to fall deftly into two categories: those who are hooked on fitness and those who avoid it with a religious fervor. Sometimes we venture from one category to the other and then come right back. We all know where we stand on the issue at any given time and as with most things, we can lie to everyone else, but lying to ourselves is just foolish. My family and I fall more into the second category. Having abandoned the notions of self-fulfillment sometime in the 1870s, we turned to fat as a substitute. Taken from my family crest and translated from the Latin is our credo, "If it is meat, we'll eat it; if it can be breaded, we'll bread it; if it can be fried, we will fry it." It is our right as Americans to fry foods in the medium of our choice. My old man once fried polish sausages in butter. I said nothing and for just a second, I wondered if it was any good.  I certainly wouldn't ask why he would fry sausage in butter. I know the answer. You can't find lard in stores any more. I'm obviously no health maven. I like a good cheeseburger now and again and pizza was a staple in college, which lasted for nearly three decades. I would like to be healthier. I would like to LIKE to eat more vegetables. I would be happy to be HAPPY to exercise and reduce fat intake as would many. That is the hope and dream of the health and diet industries that are worth billions in the United States. And probably Canada, too.  Fads abound from low-carb diet books to spinning classes to Tae-Bo videos. My favorite fads are less obvious and usually come from various industries not normally associated with health care that offer reasonable suggestions on lifestyles choices that could theoretically make your life wonderful. Wine is a good one. A few years ago, stories began to circulate about the health benefits of wine. It contains anti-oxydants,  which keep you young. Wine reduces stress or at least the alcohol in it does. It works in Europe doesn't it? The message was clear, drink a glass of wine a day America and live longer. What a crock. Europeans, at least the ones on the continent, are thin, attractive and in much better shape than Americans and it has precious little to do with wine.  Europeans smoke like chimneys, have access to all the more popular party drugs and have little to no concept of alcoholism because drinking is part of the lifestyle. Europeans don't live longer because of a glass of wine a day, they live longer because they mostly do not care about working. Most of them take siestas every day, month-long vacations and if they lose their jobs they all know where to go to get public assistance. This combined with a hatred of processed foods, a love of all things high quality, freshly picked and served and few hang ups in general is what make makes the average chain-smoking Frenchman happy and healthy.  Stress is for suckers and we eat it up in this country. Life is stress. Tell that to an Italian postal worker who averages four hours of work a day or the Spaniard after his afternoon nap.  Stress is a killer. Quick fixes do nothing. Looking for the next pill or simple exercise is futile. Fresh veggies, a little walking and some quality living will do more for good health than all the fads combined. If it's processed, forget it. If it has more preservatives than actual food, toss it. If sugar is one of the top four ingredients, leave it on the shelf. Figure out how to be happy, laugh and learn to love yourself as well as others and you will do wonders for your health. And all of this costs exactly nothing ... unless you start buying self-help books, but that is a subject for another day. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer whose column can be read on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

      Editor's note: Starting next week, a new Running Thoughts column will appear on Wednesdays as well as Saturdays.  Letters to the editor are every bit as important to the opinion page as cartoons, editorials and columns. They represent our commitment to public discourse and nothing should jeopardize that. Normally, I would not address them for fear that readers would be less inclined to send them, but occasionally they raise topics that SHOULD be addressed.  Such is the case with letter writers Connie Koch of Council Bluffs and Marcia Prideaux of Crescent. They have been debating the relative merits of our fair city - a topic of concern to us all.  The debate began with Connie Koch saying she would like a deduction on the $850 a year she will be expected to pay for such things as police, fire departments and other basic services because she and her family have been victimized recently by an alleged crackhead, a likely pervert and apparently several residents of Omaha who are hindering her career because she lives in meth-soaked Council Bluffs.  Marcia Prideaux responded that perception creates reality, these problems exist everywhere and the fact that a few Omahans raise an eyebrow at the mention of Council Bluffs is really more their problem than ours. Koch responded that Prideaux, being from Crescent likely pays as much as $700 less in taxes for the same priced house, reality is real not perceived, Council Bluffs Schools are a terrible and our strip clubs, gambling and other pastimes have made us famous for our sins. She concludes that as a true Iowan she would like to get some respect back. I cannot disagree with that. Respect rocks. OK, now that the prelims are out of the way, both writers make good points. I can certainly agree with Koch that when the government takes its bite, it can hurt. But as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, taxes are the price we pay for living in a civil society. So let's say you are right, this town is a hell hole and it is about time we did something about it. That takes money to accomplish and some $70 a month is pretty cheap. It could just as easily be argued that the reason our fair city is perceived (and I use the word "perceived" deliberately) to be on the skids is that we are not paying enough or are not able to pay more. You were mugged, one daughter was harassed and the other found a "meth lab" in a backpack. I will take you at your word. Crime unfortunately happens everywhere, not just in Council Bluffs. Even in the otherwise idyllic city of Ames, there were four murders and a car jacking in the decade or so I lived there. And meth? Oh you better believe it. The entire United States is "meth-soaked" and that includes the happy, crime-free wonderland that is Omaha. As for these conversations with Nebraskans that stopped as soon as you mentioned being from Council Bluffs, I wish it were ALWAYS that easy. I used to work in west Omaha and I too suffered with the endless commentary from individuals who had no right to finger point. This leads us to your comments about reality being real and not perceived. I hate to tell you but philosophizing should be left up to the experts because Prideaux is essentially correct on this one.  You could work yourself to death all day long and take only two breaks and if your boss sees you slacking off twice in one day, might well assume you were not working hard all day long. Is that the reality? No, it is someone's misperception. Should you suffer from that? Not rightly, but you will. The same is true with this "us vs. them" trauma between Council Bluffs and Omaha. Are we, the right God-fearing people of Council Bluffs supposed to hang our heads in shame because you say people you know in Omaha don't like us? Do they make fun of us for being "Sin City?" We have three strip clubs, one porno shop, three casinos and our bars are open until 2 a.m. like they are in the vast majority of the United States. If you tried real hard, you might find a hooker. Omaha has more strip clubs and bars by far. Their 1 a.m. rule on drinking is bizarre to say the least and exists in about as many states as their unicameral legislature. Their hookers are plentiful and stand on street corners taunting drivers.  Crime? You must be joking? I would rather parachute nude into any part of C.B. at midnight than drive behind locked doors with an ArmaLite AR-50 on my lap in some parts of Omaha. Omaha has keno and bingo. They used to have horse-racing and they keep trying to get casino action like ours. So what does it make those people who point their fingers at us and call us "Sin City?" Hypocrites. It's that simple. Perception is everything. So here is your homework assignment for this week. Just keep saying over and over again in your head or outloud "C.B. Rocks. I am from Iowa and proud. I'm ain't gonna play Sun City" and this will bolster your resolve. Take it from me, a few booty shaking joints and six-pack of Milwaukee's Best do not a "Sin City" make. Council Bluffs has problems like any city, but those problems will not get solved by giving up. We are making progress and we will continue to do so with resolve on our side.  We should all care very much whether or not this city stands tall or burns to the ground, not because it is great, not because it is heaven on earth, but because for better or worse, this is home. -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Nothing gets the blood pumping like a good, old-fashioned rant. While hostile, a rant is still the best way I know of saying, "hey, I yell because I care." Not to mention, watching someone rant and rave is usually a pretty good time for most people waiting to see a worked-up guy have a coronary. I was a bit more inclined to all-out episodes "back in the day" when, as a wild-eyed college boy, I could go off at will about those "massive, hairy, dimwitted tools in Des Moines," as my grandmother calls our legislators.  Focused, polite, professional aggression works just as well these days and is apparently still part of the equation for the fine, smooth-skinned, thoughtful ladies and gentlemen of the Iowa Legislature. Speaking of focused, polite, professional aggression, here are a few thoughts on the English-Only and Covenant Marriage bills - give it a rest. You cannot nor should you attempt to try to control the future of this state or this nation by forcing people into some predetermined good behavior model based on 1950s-era sitcoms that were bogus anyway and here is why. The state of the state of Iowa is not good. Change is coming whether we like it or not. Change is very much needed whether we admit it or not. Accepting change with dignity, foresight and grace is about the only thing that will keep us lovingly in the hearts and minds of those who come after us. By "those who come after us," I mostly mean Mexicans, Asians and other immigrants, not our descendants because they will have moved on by then. You see, I grew up in Iowa and while most of my friends hit the road as soon as possible, I stayed under the auspices that - good or bad - this is my home. That may or may not have been the right choice; I don't know for sure.  That was before I developed a penchant for play writing and a will toward word smithing. Not a lot of careers for people like me here. So it goes. Let's create opportunity, I figured. MAYBE if I had lit out I could have done better in an environment that does not so passive aggressively eat its young, but I like to think that I made the right choice.  I don't know what future an alternate reality might have wrought, I could have been stabbed straight off the bus in New York before I ever even got that lucrative busboy job to tide me over for 10 years while developing a substance abuse problem and selling plasma for groceries. Iowa is in trouble. The youth of Iowa take off at an alarming rate because there is nothing to do here and worse yet, no incentive to stay and try to make a life.  This is just a place for us to sit and wonder why while our legislature tries to come up with new and more bizarre ways to protect our dying way of life. Covenant Marriage and English-Only are two seriously hostile and futile measures. Covenant Marriage is hostile because it turns single motherhood into the root of all evil. Should people keep their pants on? Probably, but they won't and rushing to get married to any old guy just makes things worse. It is this kind of "good old days" legislation that says if people are unwilling or unable to act the way we used to back when we were young and everything was good, then we will just have to sweeten the pot by making it cheaper to get married and harder to get divorced. Covenant marriage is watered down now to giving people a cheaper deal on getting married if they get some marriage counseling. Yeah, that will work. I'm sure no one could take those classes just to get married cheaper and blow off the lessons they teach.  Let's make this about economics because we all know the poor are the only people who need educated. The wealthy, whose marriages always work as long as there is money in the bank, can afford to keep on keeping on. The problems of our society are not solely committed by the poor from broken homes and this goes doubly so for Iowa. I am betting there were plenty of Enron higher-ups from two-parent households who still managed to grow up evil as all get out. Personally, I would rather be raised by one parent than two parents in a loveless or angry marriage, but that's just me, a guy who WAS raised by one parent who has no drug problems and is not committing any crimes anyone is aware of. Let's just realize that people used to get married and stay married because there was NOTHING ELSE TO DO IN THIS WORLD. Chores needed doing, settlers were afraid of Indians, cable had yet to be invented and 98 percent of everyone on the planet was a farmer. We are a culture in transition and marriage is an ancient tradition. Eventually, it will be an anachronism. We are just seeing the early signs of that now.  And the biggest stinking piece of ill-conceived, waste-of-time, immigrant-hating legislation was last week's English-Only Bill that finally managed to establish once and for all that English is the official language of Iowa. Weak-as-water, this bill only actually says Iowa will continue to do official business in English as it has since 1846.  What it really does is tell all immigrants "Iowa hates you and doesn't want your kind here unless you are are willing to become just like us really fast." Let's be pragmatic. We need immigrants now more than ever and we should welcome them openly and accommodate them because then truth is, they aren't any more likely to stay than our own young people. You know why? Mexicans are no more likely to want their American children to grow up and work in a slaughterhouse than you are.  Iowa is changing. We should foster that change rather than fear it. Passive aggressive legislation might be very Iowan, but it is time to bend like a reed in the wind lest we break right in two.

      I am writing this column listening to "Boys of Summer" by one Mr. Donald Henley. It feels like it's 1985 all over again only without the mullet. I can close my eyes and be behind the wheel of that sweet 1972 cherry red Mustang that was my first car and first love. Cruising down Broadway on a hot summer night, a carload of my geeky friends, a cool breeze scented with burnt motor oil and that piquant whiff of fried corn chips from the Frito Lay plant blowing through the open windows, America's security unchallenged - that was cool.  Comic books, science fiction double features, occasionally girls, wine coolers in two-liter bottles like Mountain Dew and hours of gaming with A.L. class of 1984 alums, Steve Thomas and Mike Miller at their tiny basement apartment right next to the Dodge House. Good times. You don't get to relive the past and trying is usually a bad deal because nothing will ever make you 17 again. Let's face it, most things are better when we remember them than they really were any way (Now, I'm listening to "The Breakup Song" - Greg Kihn Band). I guess I am lucky to have memories. Some people seem to lose that emotional memory if not the entire enchilada. My life is a pastiche of memories sown together with a soundtrack of music. Radio tunes, classic rock, '80s alternative, new wave. AC/DC, Heart, Devo, New Order, The Police, U2, The Fixx, Social Distortion, Nirvana, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Psychedelic Furs, Leonard Cohen, Concrete Blonde, Julee Cruise and even The Greg Kihn Band if you want to know the truth. The list is endless and so are the places they can take me ("I Ran" - Flock of Seagulls). Last weekend I spent Friday and Saturday nights with a group of old friends I suddenly realized I had known for about 20 years. One of those guys, Mark Schonberg, I've know since Kirn Junior High when this odd, little kid with a broken nose used to call me "Big Man" every day in Spanish, math, gym and football until I liked to beat on him. "What's up, Big Man?" "Can I borrow a pen, Big Man?" But he's OK. Not one year of my life has gone by without talking to this guy at least once although he did blow me off pretty good in college when he mistakenly thought his frat brothers were cooler than me, the sad, silly little freak ("What You Need" - INXS). About nine of us spent last Friday and Saturday playing a game. Not drinking at a bar or doing whatever it is grown up men are supposed to do with their free time. Sounds quaint, I know, but then the game we play (and I mostly watch these days) isn't Scrabble. The closest comparison I can make is to Dungeons&Dragons and other role-playing games, but this one is homemade ( "Dance Hall Days" - Wang Chung). A great deal of this game comes from Steve Thomas's imagination, but what he and the other's have done is pull together every single science fiction film, comic book and fantasy novel ever created and made them fair game. It is a truly unique post-modern experience, primarily because no one really seems to know what they are doing at any given time. They like it that way. Pure chaos ("Luka" - Suzanne Vega).  At one moment, a Jedi knight from "Star Wars" is killing a terminator of the Arnold Schwarzenegger variety then hops in his flying Ferrari with a "Bladerunner" Nexus droid that looks like Miss January 1986 to go home to "Dark City" only to find it has been invaded by a character based roughly on the X-Men's Wolverine.  There a talking duck named Lord Aflac kills you with a handful of Lazarus Crystals he got from Hugh Hefner, the time-traveling demi-god, and it's only 7 o'clock at night! ("Should I Stay or Should I Go?" - The Clash). It is enough to make one's head hurt frankly, but the company is good and it is exciting to see men with wives and children get as worked up in their mid-30s as they did straight out of high school. Watching Kevin Rasmussen (T.J. 1986) and Bob Laudon (A.L. 1984) pretend to be warring, godlike, pan-dimensional, superheroic ... guys while bouncing off of Mike Miller's new pit set would make some people cringe, but it's once a year and how often does a black-hearted, whiskey-soaked reprobate like me get to have fun without spending a lot of money at one of our city's many fine dance clubs? It just doesn't happen ("Bring on the Dancing Horses" - Echo and the Bunnymen).  Nostalgia is a dangerous business, this much I know, but I like it any way. You can't beat it for the money and if the greatest danger is brooding over the past, well, that's not too high a price to pay. Like Neil Young said, keep on rockin' in the free world, my friends! -Greg Jerrett is a Nonpareil staff writer.

      Announcing the 2004 winner of the Nonpareil's Reader's Choice Award for Favorite Writer ..... IT'S....ME! YAY!  I'd like to thank everyone who helped me be me, namely me, myself and I cause let's face it, if it weren't for me, who would I be? And I can't think of anyone who helped me be a better righter than everyone else who works here except for me?  I think when it's official we should go back on Todd and Tyler and talk smack about Rainbow Rowell.
