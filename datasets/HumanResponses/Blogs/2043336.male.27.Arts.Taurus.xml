      The silence of a late summer's night was shattered by:  "Fuck you, bitches!  I'm coming for your women!"  Frightening?  Not when you live in the neighbourhood that I do.   No, murderous statements screamed into the cold dark night by unseen provocateurs, are pretty much the norm.  So when this guy, a slight drunk Asian twenty-something, sped past my lookout it was pretty much business as usual.  "Old ladies, I am coming for you!  I will kill you!!  Fuck you!"  and  "Call the police!  I want you to!  I want them to shoot me!!"  and on,  and on,   and on he went.  His rant was filling prime air time usually occupied by a series of "zzzzzzz" coming out of my nose (they are invisible zeds, of course, but you get the idea), so I quickly tired of him and his blanket threat to "bitches", "old ladies", and the all-encompassing "you".   My brother got tired of him, too.   So just as we were getting ready to chase him off our street and on to another, making it their problem, a fella steps out his door and says, and get this:  "Hey, Friend, why don't you come into my place and have some tea and we'll talk about what's wrong."  Typical bible thumper reaction.  Call the guy "friend" and throw some tea on his problem.  THAT'LL fix whatever is causing him to rip-roar up and down our street a 1am screaming obscenities.  Chris and I were skeptical that this 'good Samaritan' could diffuse the situation.  We figured that he had seen one too many Westerns where the generic 'wild one' was stared into submission by the Sheriff.  Our skepticism turned out to be founded, as less than four minutes of silence passed before all I heard was a mighty:  "FUCK YOU, BITCHES!!"  And saw this yellow streak zip by my window.   I think of him now only as the Asian Jimmy Stewart, who found no relief from his demons through the help of a good Samaritan or tea, and likely only slept quietly that night,  thanks in no small part, to Captain Morgan.

      Met this dude sporting what was obviously a hospital wrist band (what  type  of hospital, and what ward, I shall let you decide) who was entering a Starbucks I frequent just as I was leaving.  He had control of the real estate around the door, and I wasn't getting by without a conversation.  His opener? "Five million dollars!!"  My opener? "Wow.  That's a lot of money."  Him-  "That's how much the Government is paying the Stones to play at Sarstock!"  Me-  "Wow."  Him-  "Charlie Watts is an amazing drummer, eh?"  Me-  "Yes, he is."  Him-  "I used to drum, too, you know."  Me-  "Really?  You look like a drummer."  Him-  "I saw Charlie Watts once.  He was like [thrashing, drumming action--very intense].  I was a fucking disgrace!"  Me-  "I'm sure that you're exaggerating.  I bet you were good."  Him-  "No.  No, man, I wasn't.  I stunk."  Seconds later the man was bounced from Starbucks by a fleet of Barista who obviously already had a prior relationship with the man, and weren't interested in his entertaining tales concerning civil expenditures or his previous drumming experience. I had to run, anyway.  I met him another time, at another Starbucks, and he noticed that I was wearing steel-toed boots.  I told him I was, and that he could stomp on my toes all day long and I wouldn't feel a thing.   He proceeded to stomp on my toes. I felt nothing.  The Baristas at this particular store were horrified beyond action, and stood shivering in their green aprons while my friend exhausted himself with his little 'experiment'.

      I've always felt that if you surround yourself with the ugly and the crazy, you'll be all the more beautiful and sane.  It's about compare and contrast.

      As Frank Sinatra sang:  "It isn’t your sweet conversation That brings this sensation, oh no It’s just the nearness of you."  That's how I would describe my subway ride two nights ago, when from the belly of Castle Frank station came my new argument for mothers to  do  drugs while pregnant.  A scruffy fellow entered the subway car, sat, and began a stream of conversation that I imagine continued long after I deboarded the train at Bathurst.   He looked as though he should smell like a bowl of steamed skunk assholes, but he didn't.  Here, for posterity, I record the highlights.  And by "conversation" I should clarify: he spoke to an unseen provocateurer known only to our subway car as "Jew boy" the entire time.  "Hey Jew boy!  You want a piece of me?  Want a piece of this?  If I get my piece I'll blow your head off! (pffffft)  Blow it right off!"  "How long has it been?  How long?  Eleven years?  Eleven years!  And I hate you!  And you've never got the title!  Never got the title off me! (time-honoured motion to invisible wrestling belt around waist)  It doesn't matter what name you use in the ring, you'll never get the title, Jew boy!"  "How long has it been?  Thirty years?  Thirty years!  And I'll fuck you up, like I fucked you up all those years!  And you fucked me up--messed with the wrong guy!  How long has it been?  Thirty fucking years!"  "Bring your regiment--bring the whole platoon!  They won't get me--too scared to get me!  They'll run, if I have my piece (pfffft) I'll blow them away!  Or I'll turn them against you!  Eleven years, and no one has got me!"  "I'm not paying you for the ambulance ride!!  The driver said that I get ten rides for free!  That was the tenth!  I'm not fucking paying you for that ride!  I don't care what drugs I'm on, I'll drive the ambulance myself if you want to charge me for the ride!  I'll drive it myself, Jew boy!  The driver said 'The first ten rides are free' I remember!"  "I'm feeling fucking happy fancy-free tonight!"  "They gave me eight cats for free.  Eight's a lucky number."  And then I was gone.  Our lives, for an instant, were on the same track; then Bathurst station came, and I went.   It isn't just his sweet conversation with the Jew boy that I miss; it's also the nearness of him.

      It is raining in our fair city today.  Many people find the rain a put-off, others simply a nuisance, but some find rainy days to be desperate times indeed. Take, for example, this older man I saw while clickity-clacking home on the streetcar. . .nice and dry. . .feeling no need to sympathise with those stuck out in the weather.  The man's most striking feature?  Flowing hair like Farah Fawcett.  For a man of his age, it was immaculate! But his eyes had a wild look in them. Like an animal in a sinking cage. Or those unfortunate Irish folks in the film "Titanic" that are trapped in steerage. Not nearly as playful and coquettish as Ms. Fawcett.  I saw him desperately searching in his jacket--but what for?!  His hands were moving so rapidly around his jacket he looked a bit like those old film reels of Harry Houdini doing the straight jacket escape.  Only this spectacle much less impressive, as his hands were clearly unbound, and he wasn't hanging inverted in a pool of water.  No, he was just standing in the rain.  A clear plastic bag was ripped from the depths of a pocket, given one quick flick, as you would a garbage bag before placing it in the bin, and then. . .well. . .pulled over his head, fading flaxen locks and all!  Like netting a fish--just that quick.  The site of a wilting Farah Fawcett drag queen, practically suffocating under his own power, was like nothing I'd seen before.  I don't condone such behaviour; but I understand it. With hair like that, the rain could fuck it around so bad that there would be no point in living. Or, at the very least, killing enough brain cells to make it hard to recall such a traumatic event.   . . .I left him, gaping for air from behind his plastic tomb, and thought, "Buddy, your hair is  still  going to get fucked up."   The static charge in his hair would be his reward for such a stupid innovation in rainwear.

      The first full day I spent as a resident of our "living city" I witnessed likely the best example of human conflict  ever !  The scene: Bay Street, near Wellington. The players: Suit on foot; Suit in van. The time: roughly 10am  So this 30-something guy is getting dropped off, presumably in front of his office tower, by his wife (presumably).  The driver--the wife, as I have referred to her as--stopped in front of a service alleyway (woman driver, no survivor) and the two are kiss-kissing their way through a farewell.  An older suit in a van pulls up and decides that he wants to shove his van down this service alleyway, but (gasp!) the car is blocking his path!  The suit in the van gives his horn a friendly toot, as if to say  GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY! .  The following scene unfolded before my eyes, much to my delight:  Foot Suit-  Hey, asshole!  Van Suit-   You're  the asshole!  Foot Suit-  Whatever, asshole!  Van Suit-  Give yourself a shake, asshole!   Foot Suit does not  give himself a shake  and once the car pulls away, Van Suit tries to drive, quite literally, over Foot Suit.  Foot Suit is left looking very much on the short end of the stick, sprinting for his life in his pointy leather shoes, his jacket no longer coolly flung over his shoulder--it's flapping now more like a flag--a flag that says "I, I am the asshole!"  What I find most exciting is that neither man wanted to escalate the cursing beyond the word  asshole .  I mean, the whole escapade, from first contact to attempted murder, took maybe 8 seconds.  It was fabulously quick!  And neither one even came close to resorting to  "FUCK OFF!"   or  "GO FUCK YOURSELF!"  or even the hybrid  "You're the fucking asshole, man!" .  I mean, that's the evolution of communication in this city!  Haven't they lived here long enough to know that you don't even say  Hello!  to folks in this city before saying  Have you fucked yourself today? .  I mean, that's the natural evolution of communication in Toronto:  A-  Hello!  B-  Fuck you!  And how are the kids?   A-  Would you like to Super Size that today, ma'am?  B-  Did you just fucking call me fat?  Where's your fucking manager, you teenage fucking piece of fucking shit?  A- (to the MacDonald's burger sous chef)  Fucking spit in this bitch's McWrap!   I am also suspicious that the word "fuck" might possess a literal,  homosexual , connotation and neither man was interested in flirting with the chance of being misunderstood.  As in, "If I tell him to 'Fuck off!', will he think that I want to have penis-in-bum relations?".  But  give yourself a shake ?  Who says that to someone?

      When dealing with the street life in Toronto, diplomacy is always the order of the day.  It doesn't always work, mind you.  One evening, in front of St. Andrew Presbyterian church in Toronto, I had the most remarkable series of conversations that I have ever experienced.  The following is the 15 second transcript of the evening, wherein I managed to travel one half block and be damned twice in a most contradictory fashion.  I am "B", vagabond #1 is "A" and vagabond #2 is "C".  A-  Hey, spare some change?  B-  Sorry, not tonight, pal.  A-  Got a smoke, then?  B-  Don't smoke, man.  A-  I'm talkin' weed.  B-  Don't smoke that, either.  A- (yelling) I know you do!!   five steps pass uninterupted.  C-  Give me some change.  B-  Sorry, not tonight.  C-  It's raining and I'm hungry, fucker!  B-  I'll think about that.  C- (yelling) I KNOW YOU WON'T!   So, in the span of 15 seconds I had two different people yell two completely contradictory things at me.  The second exchange was much more frightening than the first, as "C" was about as much of a crack whore as one can become, and she yelled at me much louder than "A".  Plus, "A" made what I thought was a funny, though slightly ominous, character judgement based both on my appearance, and our 5 second "gettin' to know you" session.  It would have been like me saying to "A"  You poop in your pants! , and "A" denying it, and me countering by stating absolutely, I  know  you do!  And the funny thing is, in truth they both had me pegged perfectly.  Perhaps we could all learn just a little bit more about ourselves if we turned to our city's downtrodden--lent them an ear.  What would they say to you?  What lies would they expose?

      I have this need to share all the encounters I have with the hilariously crazy in this city.  So many people in Toronto leave their front door, turn on the auto-pilot, and notice nothing about their surroundings until they hit the revolving door at work.  Come 5pm they repeat the whole process in reverse, thus missing the rich mosaic of nutcases and slipping/tripping pedestrians that fill this city to the brim.  I suggest that people look up when they go from "a to b", and notice the world around them in all its splendor.  I bet all of us would be surprised at just how entertaining the commute can be.  In the words of one man I walked past recently in Parkdale: "I'm so sick of your bull crap that I'm begging for horse crap!" If you'll believe me, I'll tell you that he was yelling it at a book he threw in the trash cans outside his halfway house.  What was the title of the victimized tome?  Not "The Way Things Ought to Be" by Rush Limbaugh, nor "Does Anybody Have a Problem with That? The Best of Politically Incorrect" by Bill Maher, but "North American Bird Songs". He either needed something to throw at the invisible party who was spewing the offending "bull crap", and "North American Bird Songs" was the only thing in arm's reach; or, he was particularly frustrated with the suggestion that the Willow Ptarmigan was slightly more rich in voice than the Helmeted Guineafowl.  If you ask me, both birds are inferior to Buffy-crowned Wood-Partridge.  And I don't care what Mr. Crazy-Pants thinks of that.

      Recently my brother and his wife were on a retreat to downtown Toronto when, early in the morning, they bore witness to a contemporary variation of a classic story.  A classic   bestselling  story, I should say.  Danielle Steele?  No. John Grisham?  No. Anne-Marie MacDonald?  No. Better.  The Bible.  This story begins with two men fighting in the street.  Cain and Abel?  No. Are they like the sex-crazed men Lot defended the Angels from in Gomorrah?  No.  Then when, you may be demanding, are we going to get to the Bible?  In fact, the opening of the story doesn't remind me of any part of the Bible; that comes later.  They were just two men in a quarrel.  A big one. . . . . .and they were outside an INN.  A  Holiday  Inn.   This is where, for me, the story starts taking on some more Biblical qualities.  As the men disengage, one retreats to the inn, and the other is left in the street to proclaim himself the victor.  Calling after the fleeing vagabond, he warned "Come back here, mother fucker!  I'm gonna kill you!".  He didn't sound like he was lying.  He was all business.  Not like some of those other people who strut and preen around Toronto issuing hollow death threats; this guy wasn't a poser like  those  losers.      My brother and his wife just so happened to be going into the Holiday Inn as well, and caught a brief exchange between the Inn Keeper and this wayward Son (we are, after all, God's children no matter how infrequently we're sober).  They caught the conversation just as the Inn Keeper was saying, "We have no more room!  No more!  All the rooms are gone!"  Sound familiar?  Dejected by the news, this lost lamb tried to reason with the Inn Keeper. "He's going to kill me!  That guy out there is going to kill me!  You have to let me stay here!" The Inn Keeper toed what must be nearly a two thousand and four year old line familiar to anyone who doesn't celebrate the birth of Saint Nick, and repeated that there was no room at the inn.  There wasn't even an offer of a stable.  "If he kills me, then I'm going to sue you!" seethed the man.  And just like Christ, this man would rise from the dead to perform that most American of miracles: the lawsuit.  Amen.

      If my brother had not been there to see it himself, the truth would have been wasted on me alone.  I should mention that we had also been drinking. . . .and were drunk.  The scene: once again, Broadview and Gerrard!  My brother and I spot someone who is either taking a break from jamming with their "Teen Wolf" tribute band 'The Michael P. Keytones', or is a full-fledged   wolfman  ! Obviously no matter which one turned out to be true, the night was about to take a turn for the radical!  A couple seconds of gaping more, and our eyes had it: a real, live, WOLFMAN--in our neighbourhood!!  For kids that grew up with "Thriller" on their record player, life does not get any better than this!  But as soon as the Wolfman realised that it was he we were staring at, he took off with super-human speed. . .and ran directly for. . .Kentucky Fried Chicken.  We called after him: "Wolf in the hen house!  Wolf in the hen house!" Which is funny. And horribly mean. But we were drunk. And it was meant as a warning to the Colonel that something wicked his way comes.  It's still pretty funny. . . .I mean, laughing at the wolfman's misfortune doesn't make us a monster like him, does it?  I mean, not monsters on the outside.  Maybe just monsters inside.  "WOLF IN THE HEN HOUSE!!"  Are you thinking right now: "Since he's been so mean to that unfortunate man, God will give him a child that suffers from the same condition"? I'm thinking, "Cool".

      Latest evidence reveals new secrets about Don Jail incarcerees!  Anthropologists the world over recognise this latest find as definitive evidence that men in the Don Jail wore, while carousing, a hat like the legendary Bob Denver wore on his groundbreaking series "Gilligan's Island".  These most recent findings are based on the discovery of a Don Jail personal belongings bag found outside the Coffee & Donut STOP at the corner of Broadview and Gerrard, and the inscription it bore:  1 black Gilligan hat .  Authorities in the field have now set about the arduous task of understanding the meaning of the find.  What was the significance of the Gilligan hat?  Was its function the same as contemporary hats, or did it serve as mark of distinction or denotation of caste?  Was it 'one size fits all' or did the Gilligan hat discriminate between those with average heads, and those with large ones?  Already industry journals have begun to hint that this new discovery of the "Gilligan Hat" may replace the aging "Shroud of Turin" as an object of curiosity and speculation.  The "Shroud"'s popularity has been waning in recent years as experts revealed that many men of the time, and even of today's time, sport beards.

      Earlier in the day I mentioned underwear briefly. . .I'll give you a minute if you missed that one. . .and I'd like to share another story about this handy little accessory.  At the Brewery we recently hosted the Young Liberals, who partied the night away, and really rocked the place out.  But most Young Liberals saved some of their best rocking for when Prime Minister in Waiting Paul Martin arrived to smile down upon his disciples.   The excitement for some was too much.  The excitement for one young man was too much for his colon to bear.  As the dazzle and sparkle faded, and the music died, we began to pick up the pieces of what will stand, for many weeks at least, as the largest collection of Young Liberals in our Brewery at one time.  It was in this afterglow that the discovery was made.  One young fellow, bullied and overwhelmed by his own digestive system, had clearly had an accident.   To say that 'he shit his pants' would fall short of capturing the full picture. For the faint of heart, or those eating pudding, drinking chocolate milk, or enjoying a slice of pecan pie, turn away from the screen. For those who wish to bear my burden with me, read on.  In what appeared to be one, perhaps two, completely unregulated colonic releases, this Young Liberal had turned his underwear into an contemporary art piece.  The impact on his drawers was so devastating--so  saturating -- that he chose to leave them behind.  Some Marine he would make. The abandoned undergarment lay on the floor of stall three, languishing in a landscape equally devastated by additional shotgun discharges of efluence.  This was no longer stall three, not to me.  This was Vesuvius.  This was Mount St. Helens.  This was a land so depressed and scared by a digestive eruption that it bore no resemblance to the stall three we had all known.  It was a sight so shocking that even now, if I try to remember stall three the way it was before the accident, the only image that I can conjure is of a pasture, filled with daisies, and a lone unicorn standing placidly in the summer's breeze.  Clearly, that is not the way stall three once was.  If I ever find myself in a position where I'm considering whether my underwear should stay or go, I wonder what I would choose.

      My happy little family lives near the Don Jail.  We play on the same street that small time crooks, cat mutilators, drunks, and hardened murderers call home.  When they've done their debt to society, these same crooks are vomited back into circulation a stone's throw from our front door.  From where I rest my head on my pillow, when the hedges are clipped just right, I can watch them rediscover freedom. . .and occasionally take a piss on the building. Or run for their first beer in days--maybe even weeks!  Which means that we, the crooks and I, use the same transit stop.  Which, statistically, means that I've shared a morning commute with countless nere-do-wells over my tenure in the city.  I try to look my best for them.  And the anthropology has been great! See, these dudes get kicked out of the Don with all their personal belongings (for some, this accounts for 'all their worldly belongings' as well) in a baggie.   On the baggie is a list of the contents that the aforementioned criminals had on their person at the time of their arrest.  The list is to stand as a record that "Johnny No-Good had thirty-four cents, nail clippers, a pornographic deck of cards, and a red mesh cap when the Man came a' knockin'--SO DON'T TOUCH!  He'll be back to claim these things once his life has cooled down a little."  The first unlawful act that most newly re-patriated men do, excusing the ones who urinate on the Don, is litter.  The little baggie sets sail in the dusty Don Valley breeze, and the reinstated member of the voting populous is at large.  I've found that these baggies make great reading.  The best--absolute best--that I have ever read on one of these baggies also happens to carry the distinction of being the BIGGEST baggie that I have ever seen as well.  This  huge  baggie read:  wallet (empty), 6 keys, pack of 6 chocolate donuts.  Who gets sent to the hoosegow with a three day supply of donuts? And the other question that begs asking-- Were the donuts still edible when he got them back?  If you were picked up by the coppers today, what would your evidence baggie read?  Something else to consider in the morning while you're putting on your clean underwear;  Mom was always afraid that you'd befall an accident with dirty drawers, but never cautioned you about incarceration with a Britney Spears album.  Think about it.

      The 504 King Streetcar has been diverted for a number of months. This inconvenience was clearly taking its toll on the ridership--people were on edge, depressed, and more confused than usual. But Sunday, November 23rd marked a return to normalcy for those of us east of Yonge Street, and the elation for some was hard to contain.  One gal captured the excitement best when, upon hearing the good news, cheered, "Right the fuck on!  Life is pretty fuckin' good, eh?" Then she took the bottle she was holding, which was clearly  not  Crystal Springs Water, pressed it to her lips, flung her head back and took a rock star sized swig.    Though no one said it, everyone was thinking it: the chick's got a point--life is pretty fuckin' good.

      I am many things, but a random name-caller I am not. At least, not usually.  Waiting on Yonge St. is always a trip; what kind of trip depends on the time of day.   Night time is my favorite; the crazies in the city find the dark liberating.  It gives them enough shadows to hide in so that they can get up to enough mischief to entertain me.  And the best way to attract the attention of these free spirits of the night, is to try and  not  attract attention.  The more common and innocent you look, usually the more suspicious you become to them.  The stage: a bit of sidewalk outside Starbucks at King and Yonge. Yours truly barely minding my own business, let alone anyone else's, and this rough version of The Scarecrow in 'The Wizard of Oz' goes rolling by.  Stops.  Comes back to me and says:  A- "Did you just call me 'Puke', man?"  I was taken aback by a few things.  His appearance wasn't especially 'crazy'; it was how close of a look I was getting at it.  He was right in my face.  I was trying to read a detective novel.  It looked as though the mysteries of Chapter 13 would have to wait.  B- "Uh. . .no.  I didn't." A- "Shit.  I'm cracking up, man!  I'm cracking up!!"  He was.  He proceeded to ask me, at a more comfortable distance, my opinion.  It was to set the next course of his life, and he figured that I was the guy destiny had chosen to direct him.  His question?  A- "Should I stay, or should I go?" B- "That depends.  Where will you stay, and where would you go?" A- "I would go to London." B- "Ontario?" A- "Yeah." B- "The Forest City!  It's nice, pal.  I'm from near there.  You should go there; get out of this busy city." A- "If I go there, I'm going to the looney bin." B- ". . .oh." A- "I'm A-WOL from there.  The looney bin in London." B- ". . .oh.  Well, maybe you should stay here. . .?"  I didn't know if I should word it like a question, or a direction; I couldn't figure out if he favoured one over the other, and I didn't want him to think that I was telling him that he was a nutbar and should not pass 'Go', but go directly to the booby hatch.  A- "If I stay here I think that I'm going to kill someone and end up in jail." B- ". . .oh."  I've said some things in the past that could be construed as 'conversation killers', but this one was all him.  All I was thinking at the time was, "Gosh.  Am I ever glad that I didn't call this guy 'Puke'."  And then I started trying to figure out if I should dial my cell phone on the sly and leave the line open, so that whomever I dialed could catch my last minutes on Earth.  I could pull something clever, like saying "Well, any place is better than standing on the corner of King and Yonge talking about killing people." or "Have you ever just wanted to say, 'I love you Mom and Dad, and I wish that I had fresh underwear on'?".  Or maybe even just, "Scooby-Doo, where are you!?"  But I didn't.  In fact, I was concentrating so hard on what he was saying, and trying to carefully word a response, that I don't think I could have managed something even so clever as, "HEY!  Look over there!  Yoink."  My nutty buddy began to weigh the pros and cons of each city, gesturing occasionally with his hands (one of which clearly had a hospital wrist band on it).  I listened with great interest, having no other bright ideas at the time.  He laid it out like this: If he went back to London he could get help, but he'd be locked up in the hospital again, and likely in solitary, because he had been bad and run off. If he stayed in Toronto, he was going to kill someone, and he would get caught because he was never good at anything.    I thought that it was too bad he was better at killing someone than he was at getting away with it.  If I had my druthers, I rather have someone cut off my finger and never have the cops find him, than be dead and vindicated by the law.  We discussed the upside and downside of each option, and I told him that I thought getting out of the city would do him a world of good.  I said that Toronto drove me crazy, and if I were him I'd grab a bit of peace and quiet in the good ol' Forest City if I were him.  Here's the pinch, though.  He agreed with me, then asks for some money to get to London. The fucker. I told him that I knew how to get him a free ride to London.   Some people are always on the take, no matter how crazy or homicidal they are.

      In today's economic climate, with downsizing and cut-backs, it is refreshing to know that there are some people in this world who still love their job.  Take my recent acquaintance at the corner of Yonge and Dundas for example.  His chosen vocation, as he proudly announced, was:  A- "I'm a professional stool pigeon, ya see." B- "A what?" A- "A stool pigeon.  There are a lot of guys that wish I didn't see, didn't know, what I do.  I'm a listener, and then I go straight to the police when I've got something."  So a professional stool pigeon he was.  He looked the role, squeezed into a ratty corduroy suit, peering out from behind glasses that looked thick enough to be the windshield for a space shuttle.  But who did he squeal on?  A- "The underworld in Hamilton knows all about me.  Most of the good stuff I know has already been used by the police.  Now I specialize.  I can't go to Hamilton anymore--they hate me there.  They'll put me to bed with the fishes." B- "I don't think that there are any 'fishes' left in the water around Hamilton." A- "Then I guess that I'll be pretty god-damned lonely, smart ass."  I wasn't trying to antagonize him; I just needed to know more about his job.  Don't people in his position usually try to  hide  the fact that they are operating in criminal circles as snitches?  To him I must have reeked of innocence--even if he revealed himself to me, who was I going to tell.  I don't, to my knowledge, have any mobsters or drug cartel kingpins programmed into my cell phone.  A- "I have a vivid imagination.  I imagine that I'm James Bond when I'm crossing the street--it's the only way to get across alive!  The people driving those cars are crazy!!"  Professional stool pigeon and international operative for MI-6?  This little troll leads a more exciting life while he makes coco than I do even in my most daring moments.  A- "Tell me your birthday, and I'll tell you a bit about yourself.  Tell you who was born around your birthday."  AND astrologer AND 'Entertainment Tonight' birthday almanac?  This lake has many tributaries!  He did not proceed to reveal any truths about who I am, as May 17th proved to be a relatively boring birthday compared to February 7th, or even December 25th.  But he did seem to have an impressive collection of notable Hollywood birthdays floating around in that nut of his.  It was a marvelous display of 'stream of consciousness' that ended all too soon; pressing business at Dundas and Sherbourne ended our conversation abruptly, and left me on the streetcar wanting more.  It was like watching half of the movie 'Rainman'--there was no heartwarming bit at the end to rationalize all the mystery and eccentricity.  And he claimed to have a special knack with the slots. Look for this 3 Bar fella out and about, dodging cars like an international man of espionage and intrigue--you'll know him when you see him.

      I'm afraid that I'm falling into a rut.  The best thing that I have to share today is yet another "party monster on the loose".  But it's pretty sassy. From time to time it falls on my shoulders to tell a person when they've partied enough.  I hate doing it, because to tell someone at their best buddy's wedding that they've had enough is very much like telling children not to throw snowballs after the first snow.  They've been waiting all this time for their buddy to get married for the express purpose of getting shitty at the open bar.  What is it about the novelty of free booze that makes people think that they're younger/thirstier/sexier/smarter.  Enter Smarter Man #1. At this point in the party, I've already personally carried a drunk, a grown man that cannot stand whom I peeled off the floor in the bathroom, to a taxi cab.  That was 7:30pm. Smarter Man #1 has been cut off, and he knows it, as it was the subject of a 5 minute, round-and-round discussion he and I had.  Man- Can I have a double scotch and water? Me- I can get you a bottle of water, or a soda, but I won't be serving you any more alcohol, sir. Man- (blink) Are you out?  I'll have a beer then. Me- No, we're not out.  I just think that it's time for you to have a water, or a pop, sir. Man- No, I want a scotch and water.  Not just water. Me- I'm sorry, sir. . . Man- Okay, okay, okay, a beer.  And on.  When he finally got the point, it just didn't sink in.  And soon he turned up before me with a bottle of wine (his wedding favour) and wanted it opened. I told him that we weren't serving that wine, and that I couldn't open it.  But I would love to open him a water or a pop. This is where the cro-magnan are separated from the homo habilis.  Lots of fellas would be beat, would see this as a checkmate, but not this fella.  He assessed the situation for a couple of seconds (the silence always kills me--they're just working so hard in that time) and then he says:  "I don't need your fuckin' opener!"  Took one step back from the bar, brought the bottle up over his head, then like the fateful blade of the guillotine he brought the bottle down and smashed the neck off on the stainless steel countertop.  To which I replied:  "Dude, that is the stupidest fucking thing I have ever seen done at this bar, and I've seen some pretty fucking stupid things.  What are you going to do now?  The wine is everywhere, and the top of the bottle is all jagged glass; how are you going to drink out of that?"  I kid you not, he had an answer, lickity-split.  "Can I have a cup?"  The tenacious spirit of man.

      Weddings are always hollowed and blissful events.  There are so many moments in the day, and each moment is so full of cherished memories that I would only humble myself to try and record them all.  . . .save this one.  I work at Steam Whistle Brewery, and we host a number of special events each and every week.  None could be more special than the weddings that we take part in.  There could also be no more special a breed of party animal than the ones found at the free bars of weddings.  Free bar.  Listen to those words.  So special.  So sacred.  So welcomed.  Free bar.  But all good things must come to an end, and so at 1am the free bar joins all the other cherished memories, however hazy they may have become, and the special day is, for all intents and purposes, over.  For most.  I met this fella attending a wedding a month or so ago, and was just thinking of him today, and thought that I might share my own 'cherished wedding memory' with all of you.  Come 1am, he and I had become very well acquainted.  He was polite, a bit overweight, and not necessarily someone you would consider handsome--but he was polite and had a nice smile.  And he held his liquor reasonably well, considering the volume he had consumed.  When I informed him of the depressing state of affairs concerning liquor laws in Ontario, and that the bar was officially closed for business, he was devastated.  He was just the biggest fan of Steam Whistle Pilsner, and could he possibly have just a bit more--between friends.   Always the sympathetic ear, I listened intently to his pleas, and even though I adore and will protect any Steam Whistle fan's right to party--and party hard--while enjoying Canada's Premium Pilsner, the law is the law, and it's a real stinker.  I ceremoniously unscrewed the tap handle from the beer tree, and with a heavy heart, said: "Sorry, dude.  Ontario sucks." It doesn't, but at the time it seemed like the right thing to say. Then I jokingly suggested that there were several half-finished drinks sitting on tables all through the event hall; perhaps he should drink those, as they were perfectly legal in the eyes of the law, and only going to be dumped by yours truly into a swill bucket and given to the carp in Lake Ontario (which does suck).  With a glint in his eye like some mischievous goblin, he winked at me, smiled broadly, and tip-toed over to a table with three or more half-full glasses of Steam Whistle on it.  Then, like a mercurial  Frederick Banting, he began to carefully combine each glass into one.  He was being so deliberate and careful--likely because he was roaring drunk and needed to dedicate all his attention and focus to the simple task--that he took on this "MacGyver-like" hero quality.  He had been put in a situation where everyone had told him, "It's IMPOSSIBLE!  The party is OVER!  Do up your tie and behave yourself!" And he was like, "Fuck you!  I'm gonna party until the sun comes up!"  With another wink over to me, his broad smile still beaming, he brought the concoction of beer leftovers to his mouth and slowly began to pour it into his mouth.  His brain, I suppose, did not give his body the order to swallow, so his mouth soon began to overflow, sending most of his carefully collected beer down the front of his shirt. Cup empty, he licked his lips, still smiling, and gave one last wink before heading out the door.  He was not, to my knowledge, aware that his blood stream would benefit very little from the beer he had collected.  To him, the idea of gathering up unwanted drinks and giving them a home was the reward, not the drinks themselves.  A bit like early man inventing the wheel; nowhere to go, but who cares--it's THE WHEEL!  So I ask you, all of you, what good ideas have you had when YOU were drunk lately?  Were they as innovated, or as enduring?  Likely not.   Just as everyone who watches teevee isn't Marshall McLuhan; not every drunk is the ultimate party animal.

      This morning, at 5:30am, while I was waiting outside Union Station eating some street meat and watching cabs pass me by, some  dude half-lit on something ran over to me with his hat in hand and said: "Got some money I can have?"  Sorry, no.  It's all mine.  So he says to me, "I'm not your friend anymore!"  And I said to him, "Fine.  I'm not your friend anymore EITHER!"  And I put just a little of that Grade 5 school yard sass that girls give each other when they're young.  That was about as playful as I could be at 5am, being barely awake and having already decided to slowly commit suicide by eating a hot dog that may or may not have been sitting over the grill since 11pm.  This fella just blinked at me.  Whatever reaction he was expecting, he didn't expect me to put an end to our friendship.  After a few seconds he scuttled on his merry way, and I last saw him soliciting help from an over weight Slim Shady with a dismal bleach job.  As I stood under the street light, more cabs passing me by, I tried not to be offended that he had moved on so quickly from our friendship.

      I recently overheard a conversation between two teenage girls on the 504 King Streetcar that caught my interest.  Pretty much any conversation catches my interest so long as it saves me from minding my own business or has nothing to do with gutting eavesdroppers.  I suspected that these two pretty Hoochies were on their way to the Don Jail; see if you come to the same conclusion.  Girl A- I'm tellin' you, I'm afraid of him. Girl B- Then why are we goin' to see his sorry ass? Girl A- Girl, you know how it is. Girl B- Yeah. Girl A- I just wish that I had more protection at home than a buddah knife. Girl B- Like what?  A gun? Girl A- Naw.  Just a bigger knife.  Steak knife, maybe.  The girls went about checking each other's hair and doing some last minute preening before getting off the streetcar at Gerrard--my stop.  I last saw them heading towards the long line winding down the wheelchair ramp at the Don Jail.  I got me thinking about my own security. I have only a cast iron alligator-shaped nut cracker to defend myself and my own. I know that my girlfriend's mother has a Christmas Nutcracker soldier that stands five feet tall, and has scary eyes; I may try to conscript his services.

      I am sorry to report that "From A To B" continues to attract, aside from yourselves, a motley crew of voyeurs, perverts, fetishists and malcontents.  Recent searches on Google and Yahoo directed certain persons to this Blog in search of more information on:   naked hen house; charlie watts is a jew; shits himself;  and  DRUNK peed   Much to my chagrin, more noble searches, such as:    world peace manifesto;  care bear collection for sale;   and   BABY cute giggles happy   still elude this record of my online thoughts.

      Now that Christmas is over, and New Year's Eve nearing its annual go-around, it's time to start focusing on Valentine's Day.  And nothing pleases me more than to deliver a story of  urlLink unconventional romance  straight from the heart of Toronto's zaniest neighbourhood east of Yonge St.--the Arse of Riverdale!  Bruce Cockburn never said that being lovers was a safe proposition;  apparently employees of Riverdale Farm share Cockburn's mother-like apprehension.  I wonder if this is what Stompin' Tom would call a 'Thunder Bay Thursday Afternoon'?  Oddly enough, the encounter was shunned by the "dauntless" reporters of  urlLink The Friends of Riverdale Farm  who chose to favour more mainstream newsworthy events.  Even then, the "Friends" news is so sanitized and Bowderdized that their on-line publication can barely pass for something more than 'fairy tales'.  Following are examples from the "News" page with modest injections of  the truth : "English Black Sow 'Mathilda' and the birth of her piglets" ( out of wedlock ); "Cotswold Twin Male Lambs 'Frosty & Icicle' born at Riverdale Farm on January 24th" ( were sent to Italy after being caught in an incestuous embrace ); "Goat - Alpine Doe 'Kaboom' had a single birth, 1 female kid 'unnamed' yesterday around 10 am" ( and was quickly taken into American captivity as 'Detainee Kaboom' and 'Detainee Unnamed' ).  The City of Toronto also failed to deliver honest and objective coverage of the 'Riverdale Romance', even though their "Purpose" as outlined  urlLink on their website  clearly states that Riverdale Farm will try to provide ". . .the opportunity to experience the atmosphere of a small Ontario farm".   Show me a small Ontario farm (besides 'SizeSmall Farm') where there isn't a little sex between the species going on and I'll show you a time bomb waiting go off!  You'd be able to cut the sexual tension with a knife.    I also noticed that on the  urlLink list of words one might hear at the Riverdale Farm  the glossary fails to define recent expressions I feel would be helpful for visitors, such as:  beastiality  or  unconsentual sexual relations ;  dismount ;  assault with a weapon ;  animal midwifery .  The farm should be more than just 'a slice of country' for the children of large 'c' Conservatives.  Lastly, is anyone surprised that beer was involved?   Can the police really charge a guy for having his beer goggles on? Surely there are some men amongst us that can sympathise with the situation? And who was Mr. Kottaris trying to impress by running into the horse stall?  Not only was that a "dangerous" move; but when was the last time you heard someone exclaim, ". . .and he was hung like a MAN!" I doubt Holly, the resident mare, was the least bit impressed. Perhaps Rooster, the  urlLink gelding , took a mild interest.

      I have noticed that it is cherry season in Little Chinatown again, a time when young virgins giggle at the idea of having one of THOSE inside of them (while secretly worrying about what happens to the stem and pit when their cherry is popped).  And it made me think of a time, last year, when I bore witness to drama played out over the most common form of felony--the casual sample.  In this case, the 'casual sample' serving size was above the recommended, and comprised of an entire fistful of the luscious red fruit.  On the corner of Broadview and Gerrard is a place I like to call 'The Bazaar'.  One can roam the sidewalks browsing through the many commodities available, living or dead, legal or illegal, edible or simply advertised as such.  Many merchants patrol their goods along the sidewalk in an effort, I assume, to discourage thieves, as it certainly isn't to provide product knowledge.  (while standing over a basket of little blue crabs wrestling for their lives) B- How do you cook these little fellas? A- Dolla four-nine. B- Yes, but how do you cook them? A- (begins to package some up) B- I don't want any--I don't know how to cook them. A- (holds up a crab for my approval) Good? B- I don't know--I don't want any.  No crab for me. A- (dumps bag of crabs out and turns back on me, newly-liberated crabs try to hide under other crabs) B- How do you. . ah, nevermind.  I almost bought one to let loose in my bother and his wife's house as a playmate for the cat, but didn't.  His wife is a redhead and I still have too much to live for.  What I'm about to descirbe unfolded like a Hong Kong action movie version of the classic 'David and Goliath' tale. The casual sampler is A. Storekeeper is B. Casual sampler looks like he spent the under aboard Captain Morgan's ship "The Pisstanker".  A- (grabs a HUGE handful of cherries, stems and all, and begins eating them like you would an apple) B- NO!  You--NO! (grabs the forearm of A and begins to pull it away from his mouth) A- (silent, but bent on eating cherries, continues to struggle, his lips reaching for the fist with the fruit. . .red juice trickles out of his mouth) B- NO! (something in Chinese--sounds like cursing, or a call for help, but definitely not a song)  Back and forth the fist of cherries goes, and it looks for a moment that the men are too evenly matched for one to win.  Cherries are flying everywhere; some half-chewed, some still saleable.  A- (begins to yell) Hey!  Hey hey hey! B- (still cursing, absolutely not lyrics to a song)  In this situation, and if I were B, I would have let the vagabond's forearm go, as his fist would have likely catapulted the cherries into his own face.  B, however, had different plans: wrestle it out.  Good on him!  They jerked the fist of cherries back and forth until there was but one left in A's hand, which A managed to pop in his mouth.  The shopkeeper looked very upset, and his mood wasn't helped by the gloating laugh of the nere-do-well.  Johnny No-Good pushed his luck when, in response to the shopkeeper's scolding (part in English, part in Chinese, mostly just finger-waving) was to spit the ill-gotten fruit pit in the face of his critic.  The pit bounced neatly off the proprietor's forehead.  A- (loud, for the crowd) I don't know what yer sayin', but I ain't done nothin' wrong. (the irony literally staining the plaque on his teeth blood red) B- (for himself, kicked the man in his left shin)  Neighbours and friends descended on the scene to add distance between the two men, both very very angry and ready to rumble.  As a final act of defiance the hobo grabbed an orange off the stand and bit into it. . . then spat it out, realising that an orange demands more commitment than cherries, and will only yield its fruit if peeled.  Just another day at the market.

      In the small town I called home for so many years of my life (and still harbour great affection for) eccentrics were the norm, not the exception.  Everyone has something about them that, in this fine city, would cause people to cross the street to avoid contact (or, at the very least, wish that they had).  People wore cowboy hats in church, or kept Christmas lights on their house until August, or got drunk and shot the neighbour's Christmas lights off their house with a rifle, or got drunk got naked put a paper bag on their head and tormented their ex-girlfriend.  I am  especially  fond of that last one: got drunk got naked put a paper bag on their head and tormented their ex-girlfriend.  I mean, where else can something like that happen and have it seem more hilarious than frightening?  A jilted ex-lover, drunk and missing his former squeeze, one night decided that the best way to recapture that "lovin' feeling" was to pay her a visit 'in cognito'.  Lacking any real skill for disguise, and being more drunk than clever, the fellow reasoned that the materials at hand were enough to satisfy his need.  The materials happened to include all of one item: a single brown paper bag, slightly used.  Hoping, in his drunken haze, that just seeing him again might feed a flickering flame back to a fiery passion he put his best attribute forward and left the house without his pants. Or shirt. Or socks. . .actually, he may have had socks on--the paper didn't say.  Arriving at his ex's house he crept about in the bushes, bag on head, hoping against all hope that he might escape discovery and catch a glimpse of her, oh--I don't know, climbing out of the shower NAKED.  Washing the dishes NAKED.  Maybe running the vacuum over the mud room rug NAKED.  Sighing deeply the whole while, wishing that some sweaty middle-aged man with 18 fingers of rye down might come and exorcise the boredom of her world with his member.  There are no accounts of how long it took her to notice the man wearing the bag mask and stomping about her geraniums with his dingly-do swinging about between his legs like some half-dead monkey clinging to a tree in a hurricane, but my guess is "not long". Which was surprising, considering that he had taken great pains at discretion.  Ideally, when he saw her picking up the phone, it was to call him, and he wouldn't be home; that would cause desire in her, perhaps even a bit of jealously--"Out having fun with another woman!"--and just when her evening couldn't get any worse,   Ding Dong!   and there he'd be!  So when the police arrived, he pretended that he was just out for some fresh air.  And when the police asked him why he had no clothing on, and was wearing a paper bag where most men in town wear John Deere hats, he plead ignorance.  The paper didn't say if he attempted to affect the "Who. . .wha. . .where am I?  What's happening?" but if he's anything like me in a pinch, then the paper would have been wasting ink--the weather column doesn't print that the sky will be blue when you wake up tomorrow, with a 30% chance of rain; you already know.  "Yes, officer?  Can I help you?"  That would have been a smooth line, too.  The paper also neglected to note whether he was photographed by police with or without clothing, and bag on or bag off.  It would have been interesting collecting his personal belongs before admitting him to the holding cell: "One brown bag w/ eye holes".  I'd love to find that outside my house one morning.  Thinking about the story now, it reminds me of that joke about 'sealing the deal' on a date with someone who was so ugly that they needed to wear a bag on their head to make love.  He was, according to witnesses, a double bagger.

      So this is the kind of Blog I'm running?  According to my Site Meter someone happened to combine  drunk  peed OR puked OR vo "shit his pants"  into one Google search, only to discover my little hole in the wall. . .as well as a very confusing bit of homosexual erotica involving two old friends crossing paths again when one of them has become so intoxicated that he pukes on himself, pisses himself,  and  shits himself--which fits the aforementioned Goggle search criteria  very  well.    Almost too well.  Such nice company to be in.  Us 'men of letters' must stick together!  My blog has also garnered attention of Google researchers looking for information on  dundas yonge drummer bucket  AND  Steam Whistle Brewery mission statement .  My Blog was rated #1 by the following Google searches:  "Holiday Inn" and "Teen Wolf" with Christ ,  sex-crazed cat mutilators and "chocolate donuts" with "Britney Spears"  (it was the only result), and  "Wizard of Oz" hoosegow excitement .  But only came in  second  when I searched for:  Gilligan colon donut , which made me fly into a rage.  In an effort to repair my vanity, I shall attempt to clinch #1 in the category of Google search results concerning  Asparagus pee-smell Superman .  Only time will tell if my diligence and creativity will be recognized appropriately.

      So I have this Communist lapel pin. Big deal.  I was supposed to throw it in the deepest, darkest hole that I could find when I became a 'Comrade-at-Arms' in the Royal Canadian Legion, but I couldn't bring myself to the task.  So I left it on my lapel; as an appeasement to my Legion regulation book, I placed the Legion's lapel pin above the Communist one on my lapel.  One day, while waiting for the Kitchener Express Greyhound I found myself desperately in need of a sandwich.  Many Torontonians will be familiar with "The Kitchen Table", a handy convenience/grocery/deli store, and have likely used one in the past to buy an apple.   While I was browsing the sandwich meats, the gal behind the counter said something quickly, and in a pretty thick eastern European accent. I begged her pardon. She repeated:  A- "Is that your pin?" B- (pause)"My which?" A- "Your pin."(pointing at the lapel of my jacket which the Communist trinket was affixed to)"Is that yours?" B- (pause)"Who wants to know?" A- "Where did you get it?" B- "A friend brought it back from Moscow." A- "It is always nice to meet people who share my interests."  I selected my meat and bread, hoping that my new Communist comrade might help crush Capitalism by giving me the sandwich for free.  She did not.  I gave her a knowing wink as I left.  The sandwich was poorly made.  For the first time I felt very pleased that America had won the Cold War.

      Barely more than a year and a half ago my weekly ritual included taking a Greyhound Express bus from the Kitchener Terminal bound for Toronto to attend a fruitless audition, only to grab the milk run back home to Kitchener.  Upon my arrival in Kitchener (after diverting excursions to Guelph and Cambridge) I'd be dumped back into the loving arms of Grand River Transit, who's unadvertised motto is "You'll get there when you get there!".  The sum total of the year I spent 'in transit' sucking air through a wound in my chest left by the casting agents' knives is but one memory.  And some mild food poisoning from a "delicious home-made burger" I ate in blind faith at 'Kramden's Kafe' in the K-town Terminal.  A bus leaving Kitchener during rush hour is not unlike a sausage J. M. Schneider sent from the same city a century ago, only the bus is stuffed with humanity and not pig's lips and assholes.  And for some reason I had a knack for always scoring a pair of seats to myself.  There was something about me I could never put my finger on, but people just didn't seem to like the look of me.  Maybe I looked like a 'talker', or a 'farter', or one of those guys described by neighbours as 'nice, quiet, always helped with the snow shoveling' just after an arrest for serial murder--I don't know--but the fact of the matter is, no one ever sat with me. Until one day. The day that had been coming down the pipe for a long time.  The aisle seat beside me was the last free seat on the bus (as usual), when I noticed a wayward soul, three sheets to the wind and a few bricks short of a load, heaving himself down the aisle towards me.   He clutched each seatback that he passed as if it was the only thing holding him from spinning off the planet.  I, rightly, recognized his condition as 'Captain Morgan's sea legs'; an opinion I had drawn based on one waft of his breath I caught while he huffed and puffed his way towards the vacant seat.  He looked like the Big Bad Wolf's alcoholic father, who never asked to see report cards, and inevitably drove his son to eat little pigs while they huddled defiantly in their homes that cholesterol and sodium built.  On the seat beside me was my egg salad sandwich, basking in the late autumn sun reclined in a quiet and reflectful repose.  Either it had accepted that I was going to eat it, or was naively looking forward to the wonders of the Big Smoke.  Whichever the truth, my sandwich would go down a dark path that afternoon; a dark, denim crag, dusty and ill-kept.  And only my hand would live to tell the tale.  When I realised that my egg salad sandwich was about to be sat on, there was only enough time for my hand to reach for it.  The press of soft, cold egg salad put into sharp contrast the hot softness of A's posterior.  B- Hey!. . .That's my sandwich you just sat on! (I was on my cellphone at the time to my darling one and only) A- (no real change is posture) B- You're sitting on my hand and my sandwich!! A- (standing, barely) What the fuck!  And so ended our first round.  No apology.  No condolences.  No more edible food. My only consolation was the sweet voice of my true love on the line.  Then came Cambridge.  B- (after several heavy, and obvious, inhales) You gonna talk on that fucking phone all the way to Toronto?! A- So what if I am? B- 'Cause I didn't buy a ticket to listen to you talk all the way to Toronto. A- Then don't listen--it's rude, anyway. B- You're the fucking rude one! A- You're the one that sat on my fucking sandwich without even a word of apology! B- I had a ticket to that fucking seat, not your sandwich! A- Yes he did!  You didn't even ask for his ticket before you sat on him!  This drew snickers from the surrounding audience.  We were getting heated, A and I, and loud.  And decidedly less PG than a Greyhound should be.  B- Do you want to get off this fucking bus and settle this?!  You little fuck? A- (to phone) I have to get off the phone and deal with this asshole.  Good bye.  These were, in my own sweet's mind, the last words that she would ever hear me say.  Nowhere near as gallant as  urlLink Todd M. Beamer's  "Let's roll!" call to arms on September 11th, or Henry the Fifth's "Once more into the breach", but I'm no more an American hero than Ronald McDonald, and no more a King of England than Elton John is the Queen. It was the best that I could do.  After A's charming 'call to arms', I told him that I'd really rather not have anything more to do with him.  This prompted a one-sided staring contest, which is, obviously, not as effective as a two-sided one. When I asked him to stop looking at me, A replied: "No man tells me where to look!"  The only suitable reply was: "I must be pretty damn handsome if you can't take your eyes off me."  More snickers from the peanut gallery.  We spent the remaining 45 minutes trying not to look at each other, or let our coat sleeves touch.   I desperately wanted to let one of those baby-killing farts loose on him, but hadn't ate the right ingredients earlier for that kind of olfactory symphony of flavours. If only he hadn't sat on my egg salad sandwich.  When we arrived at Toronto, he deboarded and disappeared into the cityscape, leaving me short one sensational fight sequence, but with my full compliment of teeth. My one and only 'Casablanca' moment.

      Today, in the bitter cold, a homeless man made an interesting proposition to me.  Coming out of a store, into the bitter cold, I was met by what  appeared  to be a smile with two walleyes perched on top.  The smile looked like a fairy's white bedsheets hung out to dry in the breeze, the way they wobbed about in A's mouth.  A few of the sheets had blown away in the wind.  A- "Need some shoveling done?" B- (trying to choose an eye to address)"Um. . .no.  This isn't my store." A- "Got a house?" B- "Yep." A- "I'll follow you home and shovel your walk there." B- "I don't think that mom will let me keep you." A- "What?" B- "No thanks."  That's all we need at home; we already have two cats.

      A good friend of mine and I were walking home the other night by way of Don Jail Road, for the scenery I suppose, and witnessed what was likely the end result of months and months of build up.  A sole corrections officer, Officer A we'll call him, was leaving the facility by way of the front door.  It was late.  Officer A was the type of guy that would not, if this was a porn movie, be the lead.  No, he would be the character actor who provides comic relief.  The type that usually has an underwhelming man Johnson--a flower wilting in the shadow of his enormity--who wears glasses and ends up putting the handcuffs on himself instead of the well-hung crook. . .who then later must be subdued by a large-breasted corrections officer (we'll call her Officer D) who. . .well, you get the idea.    Ahem.  So Officer A rolled himself down the ramp at the Don Jail, stopping halfway to stoop and scoop up two handfuls of snow.  Surveying the side of the jail, he then appeared to bob his head, as some first graders do when counting how many brownies are left if there were a dozen and the puppy got on the counter and ate three, and threw his carefully-packed snowball at the blacked-out, barred window his head had bobbed its way to.  Noticing us noticing him, he got nervously on his way.  I think that he felt a need to explain.  But he didn't.  We understood perfectly.   Some convicts can be real jerks.  I would suggest to him, though, that he go home and put a snowball in his freezer (where mom won't throw it out) and wait until June when Johnny Badness gets released.  Think of the surprise to be hit by a snowball then!  Of course, there is a certain safety in throwing a snowball at a man behind a blacked-out barred window.

      Some women that I know just don't feel very pretty unless they have a bit of rouge on their cheeks, a tint to their lips, or some glitter to add drama.  Dangerously long eyelashes, at the very least.  Some women do it all; some indulge in only one or two rituals of feminine beautification.  Some women, like Simone, do one thing very poorly.  Simone, as I came to know her, was looking good, dressed as she was in a conservative black pant suit and black wool overcoat.  She held a newspaper, which is usually a sign of a well-informed, literate mind (unless the paper in question is the Sun. . .occasionally the Star).  In fact, the only thing that drew my attention to her was the fact  that she was applying bright red lipstick like she was preparing for an appearance in Cecil B. DeMille's  The Greatest Show on Earth . And the fact that on her newspaper she had scrawled, again in bright red lipstick, RAT FINK.  Otherwise, a perfectly normal middle-aged woman.  Her pattern of lipstick application was this: A--ever-widening NASCAR loops around her lips; B--a red dot on her forehead; C--colouring her nose; D--putting lipstick on her finger, then rubbing the excess on her cheeks; E--sticking the fully-extended lipstick directly up her nose and twist, twist, twisting it like a standard pencil sharpener; F--standing up on her tiptoes and reapplying to her lips.  She would then retract the lipstick, cap it, and place it in her pocket.  Then, she'd shake her head no, and start all over again with the same pattern as described above. This cycle continued with little change until a Braintrust sitting opposite her dropped his bottle of Canadian Sherry (screw cap) and, while already unsteady on his pins, began to chase the runaway libation down the moving streetcar.   I would have been happy had I witnessed either event on my way home; to see both was a rare delight. Once Johnny Snakebite had reeled in his catch of fortified wine, he decided to deboard.  Noticing Simone, he enquired:  A- "What's yer fuckin' trip?" B- (with surprising conviction)"Lipstick.  Lipstick is my trip."  One mystery solved.  Simone liked lipstick.  At the same time, at the front of the streetcar, a woman boarded who serves as a perfect example of my argument that people in Toronto pay ABSOLUTELY NO ATTENTION to what is going on around them.  For obvious reasons Simone was sitting by herself; the new commuter plopped down right beside her. Simone was, by this time, more red in the face than W.C. Fields.  She was clearly not sane. The best moment on my ride yet was this when this oblivious newcomer stole a glance, as all commuters do, at her seatmate.  She nearly jumped out of her skin.  And just guess what her first words were--  C-"I think that you have enough lipstick on."  I have to give her some credit: she was only saying what we were all thinking. Well, to be honest I was thinking "Holy FUCK, she's got a lot of lipstick on!!".  And do you know what our lovely little Simone said, without missing a beat?  B-"Gotta take care of my lips; my lips are my ticket!  I'm a lip model!"  For a moment I admired the clever wit of Simone and her lightning-fast mind.  Perhaps there was more method to her madness than I was giving her credit for!  Maybe the light behind her eyes was not quite as dim as I had thought?  The golden rule of "Judge not lest ye be judged!" came to mind--all those moments when my mother had scolded, "Don't judge a book by its cover!", "Still waters run deep", etc. etc. etc.  Then I noticed that Simone had stuck her lipstick so deep into her nose that it began to bleed. Book covers be damned.  This woman was crazy.

      Often I have described events in this blog that involve the stupidity or embarrassment of others.  My friend at the Riverdale Farm can attest to that.  But the time has come to take one squarely on the chin.  My immoderate bowel has reached legendary status among my peer group.  Close calls in Walmarts and fleet-footed flights from A to B have been the food to fuel many many stories in the past; that is why, when going against my older brother's advice while at Price Club to purchase the jumbo pack of Imodium, I inadvertently set a course for disaster of Germanic proportions.  The victims of today's tale are myself, a legion of school children, and good taste. But the first step in a good colon-related story is admitting that you have a problem.   Morning came, but I hesitated to greet Her with my usual song and dance routine to Billy Joel's 'Uptown Girl'.  Contorting uncomfortably in bed, my body was telling me that the dinner I ate the night before was going down with more drama than the Soviet K-19 Widowmaker.  The morning passed like rolling thunder--noisy and foreboding--but I was determined to make an appointment that I had been eagerly anticipating.  The streetcar is not a place to 'ride out' a colonic storm; the stifling recirculated air is, in many ways, a hard way to keep the aforementioned storm a private pain.  The experience of traveling from Broadview and Gerrard to King and Simcoe gave me new sympathy for others who have been forced to live their private pains in the public eye: Ben and Jen, David and Liza, me and Swiss Chalet. But something changed when the streetcar approached King and Simcoe, deep within, that led me to pull the bell chain a little harder than needed.  A quiet anxiety that had been building within me from the moment my foot touched the sidewalk outside our home was coming to a boil. Hundreds of school children happened to be gathering at Roy Thompson Hall that day, yellow buses constipating movement around the concert venue, much to my chagrin. Acting like nothing big was up, I casually deboarded the streetcar and glided into the streetcar shelter.  My brother, I thought, must be called and employed as a secretary on my behalf.  He'll call the producers I was to see and tell them that the "chefs" at Swiss Chalet were sons of bitches and I was unable to hold my appointment.  Or something to that effect. Just as our cell phones connected, Fate dealt the final, humbling blow. All my brother heard on the line was a tremendous heave, followed by a mighty splash of vomit, then legions of children screaming and fleeing the scene.  In desperation I tried to answer his cries of "Tell me where you are!  I'll come for you!" but my body was busying itself with the manufacture of unsavory orange and chicken flavoured snow cones.  The next recollection I have is scornful looks from school teachers, teary-eyed fear from a random collection of school children huddled as close to the crosswalk as possible, and my brother heroically placing me in the passenger seat of his Vibe.  Nothing puts life in perspective like vomiting in public.  Trust me. If I had children, I would have gone home and hugged them. But I don't. So I watched a movie and went to sleep.

      There is a tortured soul on Yonge Street whose appetite for the spoken word is insatiable. I say "word" instead of "words" because his appetite is very selective. Like Fraggles for Doozer buildings. Or Gargamel for Smurf meat. Or Oliver North for lying.  Yes, this discerning palate craves but one word, and one word alone: FUCK.  The Grandaddy of all curses, this man must be admired for cutting to the chase.  There's no "Holy FUCK!" or "Jesus FUCKing Christ!" or "Mother FUCKer!"--not for this gent!  Oh no!  He gets straight to the point when he's cursing!  And he's blind.  And his swearing is very, very loud.  Thankfully, his blindness seems to keep him out of trouble, as he more often than not is cursing at a brick wall, or towards traffic (which in Toronto takes very little notice of those on two legs) and not directly at someone.  Occasionally his cursing verges on  adorable  even!  Like the day I saw his so gosh-darned tuckered out from screaming his obscenity that he had slumped to the ground, his only support a wall (which had obviously considered the earlier cursing he had given it as 'water under the bridge--noble, those walls!).  Many times I've been tempted to strike up a conversation--a little small fucking talk--but only once have I made a genuine effort.  On the approach, ready to say "How the fuck goes it?", a lady in front of me motioned to put some change in his outstretched Starbucks cup.  He jerked the cup back towards his breast just as she let go of the change, and coins danced around on the sidewalk like little elves wearing bells around their tree bakery!  B- "Don't touch them!!  Leave them on the ground!!" A- "Let me pick them up for you." B-  "No!  Leave them!"  He was agitated.  The good Samaritan was scared.  I had lost my nerve. The kind-hearted lady had put my mark in a bad mood, and I didn't figure he'd appreciate a little small fucking talk.  I was surprised at how quickly he pulled the cup back; I mean, another second and he'd be 35 cents richer! I'm sure that the lady was surprised at how quickly he pulled the cup back; I mean, another second and she'd have done her philanthropy for the week! He didn't give a fuck.  I wish that people like him would go on Speaker's Corner. What a ratings boon that would be!

      All things bright and beautiful, All creatures great and small, All things wise and wonderful: Why,  Parkdale  has them all!  Recently I had the pleasure, and courage, to stroll through Parkdale late at night.  And to my great delight, I saw a midget!  Being part Irish, we folks from the Emerald Isle consider the sighting of a Leprechaun just prior to St. Patrick's Day a good tiding.  Leprechauns are as important to the Irish, and our celebration, as the albino groundhog is to the Wiratonian and Punxsutawnian.    I hope folks have no ill will for me as a result of my using the word 'midget'; then drawing a straight line from midget to leprechaun.  If it looks like an orange, and smells like an orange, and tastes like an orange, it's likely an orange, right? I think that the onus is on YOU, the reader, to accept that midgets and leprechauns exists, and are sometimes one and the same.  And anyway, the story hasn't nearly reached its offensive potential.  A local watering hole in Parkdale, The Dufferin Gate (known familiarly as "The Gate"), set the stage for this little drama to be played out.  At nearly midnight I observed what looked like an infant with rickets hobble out of 'The Gate' and towards a tiny bike.  Seconds later a drunk blonde and her escort fell through "The Gate" entrance and dove at the Leprechaun as he tried to mount his bike. I listened carefully to see if, in the spirit of tradition, the Leprechaun revealed the location of his pot of gold. The dizzy blonde had something other than gold coins on her mind--she wanted to say something to him:  A- (unlocking his bike) B- (grabbing Leprechaun) "Hey!" A- (balls himself up as if to protect vital organs and roll away) B- "I've never seen a little person in real life before!  Only on teevee!" A- (clearly flattered by the attention) "Oh. (inaudible)"  The boyfriend now asked his burning question.  C- "Can you double me on your handlebars?"  To his question, the bow-legged Leprechaun sat on his wee bike in silence.  I left the scene quickly, not wanting to see something that would pull at my heart-strings and give me guilt-ridden pause at my keyboard when I tried to record the goings-on.  Also, I hated to look at two people who caught a Leprechaun and blew their chance at riches with stupid queries and questions.

      The other day I was at the corner of Bay and Bloor. I was patiently waiting my turn to use the revolving door at the TD Bank. The reason I was patient, was my mother always taught me to respect my elders.  And one of my elders was at the power position within the revolving door.  The door was moving like the hour hand of a clock. But I was patient, out of respect. Even though it was cold outside.  Inside, an elevator opened, and out fired a pinstripe bullet.  The executive clearly respected no law above the GO Train schedule as he roared toward the revolving door.   Laws that he lay ruin to: 1. Do not run in leather shoes on a polished surface. 2. Do not run in a suit. 3. Do not run if the last time you ran was in Grade 8, because you will look stupid. 4. Respect your elders.  There I was, patiently waiting for the inevitable.  The tortoise was about to meet the hare, head on, and there was nothing I could do. Or, at least, very little. Aesop never made the story this much fun.  The Suit either didn't see, or didn't care, or didn't care to see, my most revered senior plodding through the revolving door, and powered through the door like it was his job.  He was so quick that I am sure my father would describe the event thusly: "Like shit through a goose!"  It was just that fast.  As I gathered from eavesdropping on my three scientist roommates in university, for every action there is a reaction, which was traditionally related by the example 'lifting Labatt 50 to mouth will lead to Bruce Springsteen on the record player'.  This poor darling, my elder, having been caught in the cross-hares of the suit in sprint, found that she was no longer pushing the door, but the door was pushing her.  Most times this would be helpful (ie. i am walking on the sidewalk/the sidewalk is doing the walking for me) but only if you're expecting such kind assistance.  The senior, who I am most deferential to, was not expecting the help. How she stayed on her feet is a wonder, but she did. I hurried in behind; the door was still spinning like a hurricane, so I didn't have to exert myself.  I did, however, have to approach the door like a little girl waiting her turn at double Dutch. My elder galed at me, "Someone should tell that man he shouldn't do that!" That 'someone', according to the lady's wagging finger, was apparently me. I said, "Yes" and carried on my merry way. I'm a fit enough guy, but he was moving pretty fast.    Let's not forget that I had, like, wasted half my lifetime waiting for her to creep two feet.  Besides that, what part of the expression 'rush hour' had mystified her?  Led her to believe that it was the perfect time for her to do some cherry picking?  I respectfully ask her to answer me that.

      At least one man in Toronto had a rough Thursday afternoon.  And I met that unfortunate man's friend, we'll call him A, as he tried to solicit streetcar fare at Yonge and Dundas. With suspiciously fresh n' minty breath, A explained that his buddy had been shot and that he needed change to make the fare so that he could rush to his friend's side and whisper things like "Everything is going to be okay", "Hang in there", and "Don't follow the light" into his fallen pal's ear.  If  my  chum was going to whisper encouragement into  my  ear, which I will add is quite close to my nose, I should hope that he would show me the same courtesy as this fine specimen.  His breath was beyond reproach, even from my standing position halfway down the streetcar!  It was as if someone had open a window on a blustery January day only to discover that it was snowing and blowing  urlLink Mojito  out.  Dee-lightful!  Patience, not brevity, was the soul of his wit, and it eventually paid off; but apparently some riders had their doubts regarding the validity of A's story, or the severity of the injury caused to his friend.  A, having reached the summit of his goal, now faced the challenge of descending safely into a seat.  By the expression on his face, this was a taxing decision.  He was considering seating options with the careful attention of a Bride-to-Be examining Reception floor plans.  While he weighed the alternatives available, a tiny voice squeaked:  C- "You!  Sit down!"  Not the most offensive thing I've heard squeaked on the streetcar, I must admit, but to A this was an attack that wounded him deeply.  He turned his entire attention to the complainant, relieved, in my opinion, to set aside the seating issue for a bit.  Focusing, as best as he could through eyes glazed over with welling tears, he gave the speaker a thousand yard stare that was meant to be withering and critical.  Everyone was on the edge of their filthy red seats, waiting for what would happen next. Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  Finally A broke the silence.  Slowly he admonished:  A- "There are women and kids on here--women and  kids !  Shame on you.  Shame."  He pointed, but his finger roamed from person to person, as if to indite all those on board for the perceived slight.  Then he collapsed into a seat and muttered, "Shame!".  Things were starting to settle down, which in Toronto takes about ten seconds, when inspiration struck and A leapt to his feet, and dove at the yellow 'stop request' cord.  Straining under A's weight, the 'stop request' cord cried 'DING!' and the streetcar stopped.  Off A got.  No hospital in sight.  Only the 'New Moon Cafe', it's window reading " Bottle Beer.  Draught Beer.  Free Internet. "  Head hung low, A solemnly crossed the 'New Moon' threshold.  Does bluemountain.com have E-cards that communicate the idea, "I'm sorry that you got shot up"?  I don't know. Even if the internet did offer such thoughtful sentiments in an E-card, I doubt OHIP covers bedside ethernet connections.  Clearly, OHIP must join the 21st Century; or hospitals must become more competitive and offer bottle and draught beer.

      There are many traditional signs of spring, iconized by the media, that amount to little more than a hill of buttons to the poor bastard standing in 10 centimeters of mid-May snow wearing capris and Birkenstocks all because he placed blind faith in some hayseed albino woodchuck that didn't see his shadow. Similarly, the amazed gardener will simply mutter, in a soft, mournful tone while standing over her annuals, "I don't understand--I saw Mr. Robin Redbreast--I don't understand."  What is there to be said?  Bad things happen to dumb people.  But to the capri-wearing gents and frustrated green thumbs I announce: Spring has sprung! How do I know? "Did he see  urlLink butterflies fluttering, frogs jumping, worms squirming, or ferns. . .ferning !?!" the ladies at the Bridge Club ask.  My dear friend  urlLink The Armchair Garbageman  would no doubt kindly suggest that, this Friday, the sight of common folks hitting the streets at 2pm to clean up garbage for twenty minutes is a sure sign that spring is upon us.  All are adequate, but rather pedestrian and "commercial", examples of spring; mine is much  sexier !  The Snowflake Maker has shaved his beard. (the tale of how I met The Snowflake Maker begs to be highlighted in an entry of its own, but suffice it to say, he holds a very special spot in my heart)  And since my spotting of the freshly shorn Snowflake Maker is what I consider a bona fide, bankable sign that spring is here to stay, I would kindly ask that you, the reader, assume  even more  responsibility for your city, and do as my dearest friend The Snowflake Maker does: randomly Windex the street.  On my way to work I spotted my friend nervously petting one of his many LCBO bags.  The bag was large and round, and he was stroking it tenderly, as only an actor on Canadian television drama playing "pregnant" does.   The smile on his face, and his lingering hand, was somewhat suggestive of a pedophilic urge; however, it may be unfair to suggest that if he  was  pregnant his stroking was pedophilic, as there has been little progress on who is ultimately correct in the "Right to Life/Right to Choice" disagreement. I digress. No matter the mania, he looked like he was having a hell of a morning. And so was I. I'm always delighted to see him. I was also delighted when he pulled a large yellow hard hat out of his bulging bag, followed by a brand spanking new bottle of Windex!!  Experience has taught me that in situations where this individual is concerned, the addition of two seemingly ordinary items can create magic.  Windex bottle in hand, he approached the curb like he was trying to sneak up on it.  Studying his street canvas with the shrewd eye of an artist, he pointed his bottle and  squirt squirted  a spot on the ground.  He continued on further down the street, eyes still fixed on the parking lane of Broadview, then  squirt squirted  again! My heart cried, "Marvelous!". What discerned the filthy spots from the clean was based on criteria known to him alone; in my opinion, I would eat dinner off of a slaughterhouse floor before I'd dine on the asphalt of Broadview.  It could RAIN Windex and I'd still tippy-toe on some parts!  But he had guidelines, and he was passionately sticking to them. Right in the middle of his superclean, a van tried to pull away from it's parking spot; unfortunately it happened to be sandwiched between two very dirty bits of real estate. The Snowflake Man  squirt squirted  at the nose of the van, then scrambled to the rear and  squirt squirted  a bit there.  Back and forth he scurried, and the van rolled to and fro, the driver desperate to escape.  It was like a game of monkey in the middle if you replaced the ball for Ammonia. I was in heaven. It was my own private Wimbleton! Fabulous!  The van finally escaped and sped away.  The Snowflake Man wandered off in the opposite direction,  squirt squirting  as he walked, until he faded into the horizon.  The first thing that sprang to my mind was the City of Kitchener's slogan, emblazoned on each litter can:   Keep Kitchener Clean as a Kitchen!   I suggest:   Keep Toronto Clean as a Bathroom!   to honour the effort that is already underway in our fine city's streets.  And I happen to have friends in high places that know about garbage in this city.

      Modern surgery can work wonders. People the world over, each and every day, look at themselves in the mirror and say: "I'm just not making the grade--my nose is too big." or "I have spare tires that only a dune buggy could love!" or "My ears make me look like an waffle."  All cruel, yet all devastatingly true.  Recently, as a result of a visit to the neighbourhood convenience store, my eyes have lingered longer on a certain part of my body.  With a heavy heart, I had to ask myself: Has my back side ever offended anyone? I mean,  really  offended anyone. My question might sound ridiculous to the uninitiated; but those that have been to Trident Convenience will know the source of my insecurity exactly. And it isn't popular media or fashion runways.  There is a cat there without a tail. The cat is black and dingy. The cat and I met when he ambushed me from above the door, continued on down my left shoulder and arm like an unwashed avalanche, piling to rest on the Toronto Sun rack.  I was surprised that my surprise had not caused another avalanche of yesterday's supper down my pant leg.  I noticed that the cat had no tail, and was black, and immediately a funny line occurred to me.  B-  (to the clerk) "That black cat's got some bum luck--he's lost his tail!"  It was something to that effect.  You may not be impressed by that line, and to be honest I had a million better lines, most making a clever reference to the nursery rhyme about three little kittens that have lost their mittens, but something about the expression on the girl's face told me that she wasn't really the booky type.  That literature was something one found on the streets of Toronto when the snow melted.  The clerk, rather matter-of-factly reported:  A- "The tail knocked stuff off shelves; I put elastic on it, and it fell off."  Well.  There you have it.  Matthew said it best in Chapter 18, verse 8: ". . .if it offend thee, cut it off."

      Mr. Dressup, Raffi, and Fred Penner all advocated the practice of 'sharing'. Examples of sharing that I like best are: ice cream; scotch; licorice. Examples of sharing that I tolerate are: colds; responsibility for a broken vase; seal clubs.  Today, however, was an example of sharing that I like least: an opinion contrary to my own.  I drive, as is my good fortune, a classic Ford Fairlane Ranchero.  With its aggressive angles, fuzzy dice, and a paint job so midnight black that a bat would get lost, it looks pretty snazzy.  The fact that it is a 'cruck', or car/truck, only adds to its mystique and charm. Driving around town the Ranchero raises a lot of eyebrows, and many people will call out "Nice car!" or "Lookin' good!" or "What year is it?".  The last question is the most popular. "Lookin' good!" is the least.  People who call out "What year is it?" usually have no idea what year, or even what make, the car  should  be.  Being guilty myself of this, I should know.  The question is just part of the fraternity of men.  'Car Talk' binds us together the same way 'Sex in the City chat' or 'Jennifer Aniston Hair Talk' does women, and therefore there is no shame in using a slightly misdirected question to open up discussion.  So today, from the sidewalk at Queen and Woodbine a man calls to me, the Ranchero driver, and he says:   A-  "Is that a '68?" B-  "Naw, it's a '74."  The man looked the car back to front.  A-  "Looks like a '68!" B-  "Nope.  I'm pretty sure it's a '74, pal."  This is where things got a whole lot more 'Toronto'. The guy looks right at me, and shouts:  A-  "Fuck you!  It's a '68!!"  I drove on.  Fuck me?  What the hell is that?  I mean, I'm the one behind the wheel; I ought to know better than some chump  walking  what year my car is.  Things would be different if I called out to him while stopped at a red light and asked, "Those 'Hush Puppies' the Aught-Threes or the Aught-Fours?".   In that situation one could safely assume that I don't know the correct answer and require clarification.  Isn't that the fundamental difference between a  question  and a  statement ?  Flustered, I pulled over to consult the Ford Owner's Manual.  I only needed to take it half way out of the armrest to read:  Enjoy driving your 1969 Ford Fairlane Ranchero!   So I was wrong.  But so was he!  Fuck him.  I wonder if he'd be as cheeky asking Phyllis Diller her age.    Phyllis Diller-  "Twenty-nine!"  A-  "Fuck you!  You're seventy-eight!"   Not likely.  She'd back her car over him.

      I realise salesmanship is a virtue that not all possess. Take American foreign policy in the hands of George W. Bush, for example. Or, on a more metropolitan scale, panhandling.  There are certain strategies I have observed around town for soliciting funds that are more effective than others. For example, smell. That's a "don't". Be polite. That's a "do". Offer some of your Scope in exchange for a quarter or two. That's a "maybe".  I've had days where I'd have killed for a swig of Scope to keep me keepin' on. Offer to "smack" someone if they don't comply with your request. That's a "don't".  A practical application of these rules of thumb can have a positive or negative effect on your cup balance at the day's end.  Recently, an acquaintance of mine from Timmins (or was it Sudbury?) strayed a bit from my 'common sense rules', and his freeform panhandling was both unorthodox and unsuccessful.  A-  (approaching me outside Union Station)"Hey, buddy!  Can I speak to you for a minute?" B-  "Sure!"  A-  "Look.  I'm, I'm real embarrassed to be asking you this, but I. . ." B-  "Sorry, pal.  I know the schpeel you're going to give; not today.  Have a good one, though." A-  (to my back as I walk on)"Fuck you!!" B-  (amazed; turning)"What did you say?" A-  (amazed that I turned to face him)"Fuck you!!" B-  "Look, buddy, I was trying be polite and all you can do is tell me to fuck myself?" A-  "Trying to be 'polite'!" (mimicking my voice, like a girl's) " I know the schpeel!   Fuck you!" B-  "Look, asshole!  I do know the schpeel.  You're real embarrassed, but you need some money to get a train ticket back Timmins, or Sudbury, or wherever, and could I spare some change.  Am I wrong?" A-  (silent, a bit confused) B-  "There's no reason for you to tell me to 'FUCK OFF!' just because I don't want to give you money." A-  "I've got $30 already!" (shows me a ten and a twenty) B-  "Can I have some money?" A-  "No!  Fuck you!" B-  "Fuck you!  You've got more than me!"  I began to walk away again, when A tried to get the last word. No one gets the last word with me.  I hate having the second to last word!!  A-  "I should smack you." B-  (turning to face A again)"You should  what ?   Smack  me?"  I was getting pretty indignant.  This dude was trying to get money out of me in all the wrong ways.   And, I feel it is important to note that he was no bigger than a benchwarmer on an Eighth Grade basketball team.  Now I'm by no means a goliath of a man, but if I can see someone's pattern baldness, I begin to feel at bit bold.   B-  (nearly chest-to-chest)"If anyone is going to do some  smacking  it's not going to be you, little man!  Try using some manners, asshole!  This approach is getting you nowhere fast." A-  "Whatever!"  He started to walk away, but I felt proud because he kept looking over his shoulder in what I construed to be a 'fearful' manner.  Afterwards, it dawned on me that I should have given him some money to get back to Timmins or Sudbury as part of my civic duty to clean up the manners of the city.

      Sometimes when I'm riding the streetcar I eavesdrop, or glance over someone's shoulder at what they're reading, or make faces at babies.  Sometimes I downplay character traits that I think people will find undesirable or creepy, like eavesdropping, glancing over people's shoulders, and making faces at babies.  So I was 'glancing' at something this late-twenty-something Asian girl was reading the other day on the streetcar.  She was conservatively-dressed and wore glasses, which made me automatically think that what she was reading was likely engineering notes from school or something; but this was not the case.  Scribbled out on one sheet of lined steno paper were the following nuggets of knowledge:  "Children are watching too much television today and it is making them stupid and violent.  We need to control television to control violence."  "There is so much war in the world today that life is barely worth living."  "Food in the grocery store is covered in germs."  "Be careful who you trust.  Not everyone wants the best for you.  Some people will take advantage of you."  "People should be told what to do.  If we are told what to do, then everything will be ok."  Life's a real bowl of cherries to her, ain't it? Regrettably my study of 'her words to live' by was cut short when she noticed that I was glancing at her paper.  I felt like telling her that it wasn't my fault, that television was to blame, but she had folded up her paper and moved away from me by the time I thought of my clever line.    The more I thought about the adages on her paper, the more I thought, "Maybe I should make up my own 'words of power' to read on the streetcar!!"  So I did:  "People are watching too much 'Train 48' and it is making them stupid and causing them to have unrealistic hopes for their own transit experience.  We need to derail the train and park it in the roundhouse next to Mike Bullard."  "There is so much Bubble Tea available on Yonge St. that no one can make a living."  "Food in the Dominion grocery store is over-priced."  "Be careful when picking up newspapers left on the streetcar.  Someone may have used it as a tissue.  It happens."  "People get off the streetcar through the front doors should be told to go to hell."  My list isn't nearly as interesting as hers. In fact, to be perfectly honest, I prefer her's over mine.  It has more. . .spunk. I think that they'd make perfect fortunes for fortune cookies.  Very right wing, Communist manifesto-cum-Oprah fear-mongering fortunes, but pefect nevertheless for today's world!

      It must be the company that I keep. Recently I've been very upset at the sight of people littering, and I've been dealing with litter situations like I'm 6'2" and 190lbs. If I had a goatee and played the tuba I'd be the spitting image of my dear friend  urlLink The Armchair Garbageman .  Behaving like a hulk of a man is something that I just shouldn't do.  I was with my fiance the other day and saw this punk chuck litter on the floor of the Eaton's Centre.  Something in me came loose, and I swiveled on my heel and caught up to the offender.  B- (tapping the punk on the shoulder)"Hey buddy!  You want to pick up the litter that you threw on the floor back there?" A- (surprised, not impressed)"Who the fuck are you?  A mall cop?" B- "No, I'm somebody that doesn't want to walk through your trash; who the fuck are you to throw garbage on the floor?" A- "So what?  You want me to go pick it up?" B- "I'd really appreciate it if you did."  At this point he became very agitated.  He was either: A)very embarrassed and trying to think of the right words to apologise; B)trying to think of a clever way to avoid having to pick up the garbage; C)wondering whether to use his left or his right fist to punch a hole in my face. Or perhaps, D)all of the above.  He paced back and forth in front of me like a caged tiger, then came right up to my face and delivered his ultimatum.  A- "Okay.  Okay.  I'll pick it up.  Where is it?  Show me."  I felt like saying, "Jeez, it took you long enough!"  Instead, I pointed to the garbage on the floor and said, "Right there, buddy."  A- "I'm not your fucking buddy!"  Fine.  Then, a light goes on in his head.  A- "Follow me outside.  I want you to see me throw this out.  Just come with me  outside , yeah?" B- "Hey, if you tell me that you're going to throw it out I believe you.  I didn't call you a  liar , I called you a  litterbug !" A- "You know, I could throw you down on the floor in, like,  two seconds  and embarrass you, but I'm not going to do that!" B- "Fine, fine.  Hey, I'm just glad that you picked up your garbage."  And I waved my little condescending wave, the one I reserve for jerks I bother while in a moving vehicle or on the other side of a pane of glass, and chalked another one up for our beautiful city.  He left, up the escalator, hopefully to use that street level garbage can that he had so desperately wanted to show me.  Along with my clean streets vigilantism, I've decided to eat my vegetables so that I can grow up big and strong, and become an "environmental champion" just like   urlLink Woodsy Owl . In the future, I'd prefer if punks just said 'Ye-ye-yes, sir!  Right away, sir!" and got their damn litter without all the drama.  And lastly, in an effort to pattern myself after my hero even more completely, my "wise request" will forever be. . . "Give two shits, don't toss garbage where I sits!"  Instead of a forest ranger, I'll be a litter pirate!

      Yesterday I got a ticket nearly a full two minutes after my parking voucher had expired, so I was asking for it.  I noticed the ticket the same time two slack-jawed teenagers three chapters in to an excellent bottle of  Maximum Ice  did.  They offered their support:  A- "You got a ticket, man!" C- "Ya!  You got a ticket!" B- "Yes, I certainly got a ticket." A- "Man, that is an awesome car, dude!  It should be  illegal  to give a ticket to such an awesome car!!" C- "Ya!  Your car is too awesome to get a ticket!" B- "I couldn't agree more." A- "It's not right to give that car a ticket. . .!!" C- "It should be illegal!" B- "You're telling me. . ." A- "Fuck, man, that car is awesome!  You shouldn't get tickets!" B- "Yes.  Thank you.  Write a letter to your member of city council."  I doubt they'll do it. Sure, right then they thought it should be illegal to give tickets to people who drive '69 Rancheros, but wait until they get home and sober up.  Then suddenly all that energy, and all that interest in civil law, will lose its immediacy.  And I'll keep getting tickets.

      Today I went to see  Supersize Me! . I stepped into the popcorn line behind a woman who has aged fairly well over her 60-some-odd years and began to daydream about whether or not the documentary was going to live up to its hype. During my introspection I felt eyes staring at me, and realised that it was the well-kept aged woman before me in line.  A- "You have an absolutely beautiful face!" B- (I was taken aback)"Well, thank you!  I have a twin brother, so there's plenty of this face to go around!" A- "Beautiful and amusing!" B- "Ha ha ha!"  To be honest, I wasn't surprised that she found me handsome.  I have, since I worked a bingo in my youth, been very popular with her demographic. In fact, my wit and sex appeal have very strong showings with woman aged 58 straight through to 90!  I think it stems from the fact that I have a face which looks very well in knitted sweaters. (a caveat--keep your widowed grandmother away from me if you want her chaste image to stay in tact)    She turned to get napkins, and the space between us was bisected by a middle-aged man going towards the ticket wicket.   As he passed, he broke wind with extraordinary vigor.  It was shamelessly loud.  My sweetheart turned around in surprise, and there I was, grinning for the wrong reason.  Her eyes said, "J'accuse!"; I tried, unsuccessfully, to get mine to say, "Mais non!". Immediately I inherited the guilt meant to wrack the conscience of the braying ass who had dealt the deal-breaking overture; however, he had more pressing issues at hand, asking the ticket seller in a loud urgent tone for the washroom's whereabouts. . .apparently he was out of room in his pants.  She gave a polite smile, like you do on the subway to the parents of a child you've just observed picking their nose and eating it, and went off to find a seat in Theatre 3.  Had I been on the ball, I would have answered her gawk with, 'You're excused' followed by placing my hand over the top of my tea cup so as to suggest that it needed protection from contamination.    That, or given a surprised look and used a line my father has employed among friends and family--"Did anyone see that little elephant?"

      When in my Ranchero, it's hard not to feel like a celebrity.  In fact, while in the Ranchero, it is hard not to feel a number of things.  A short list of inspired feelings includes, but is not restricted to:  -feelings of David Lee Roth-like power; -feeling that, with a six pack, anything is possible; -feeling that the world changed, for the worse, on December 31st, 1982; -feeling that, given the chance, a Ranchero driver would never permit a white tiger to bite his head like Roy Horn (of Siegfried & Roy), and would soundly whoop the ass of any tiger, white or otherwise, attempting such bitch-ass behaviour; -adopt Alfred E. Newman's laissez-faire attitude of 'What, me worry?'  I'd like to see the list of feelings conjured up while driving a Civic: -feeling that living in the basement of mom and dad's place is okay; -feeling that Ground FX, decals, and noise of modified Civic adequately replace awesomeness, speed, and ability to haul loads in the bed of a Ranchero cruck; -feeling that, in a Civic, one could skip 4th period math and not get caught. -feeling that, given the chance, a Civic driver would never permit Odie to steal his Lasagna like Garfield does, time and again, with humorous results; -adopt Randy Newman's attitude that 'Short people got no reason to live'.  My point is this: today a pan-handling deaf-mute walked up to me while I was putting a parking receipt in my window, pointed at the Ranchero, then gave the thumbs up. I nodded. He then produced a note explaining that he was a deaf-mute looking for money. I shook my head. Finally, he pointed at the Ranchero, then at himself, then made a motion like he was driving. Even though he used proper ten-and-two steering technique in his mime, I shook my head.  The power of the Ranchero to bring people together and bridge language barriers may be  exactly  what the Middle East needs right now.

      Union Station is the heart of Canada. Every creed, colour, and income bracket converge there. When you mix so many different people together, you really never know what you're going to get.  A few days ago, what I got was a daily affirmation of self.  For the amusement of those in ear shot, a man who's been alive for more years than he has teeth in his head (he most certainly was not 10 years old) was singing 'King of the Road' in an attempt to gain either money or fame.  Folks didn't seem to be ponying up much dough, and he wasn't holding a Starbucks cup, so I assumed that it was the latter. As Janet Jackson was in town I felt like suggesting that he show a tit and really step up his performance.  I even started picturing my delivery of the comment in my head--I'd say it loud enough so that the crowd waiting for their respective Go Trains would think that I was both witty and topical, as well as kindly to the homeless and edgy.  The remark would surely immortalise me in conversation; my bit of wit repeated to "Train Friends" on the ride home to Oshawa and Markham, making life even more closely imitate the art of "Train 48".  Just as I was about to open my mouth, the Tent City Balladeer sang, ". . .I'm a man of means by no means  King of the  belt buckles "! " Wait a cotton-pickin' minute!  That's not the words to the song!! ", thought I," He was referring to ME! " Self-centredness aside, I was sure that it was me he was referring to because it was I that he was making eye contact with. . .and I was wearing my  Bodacious belt buckle  which is the size of a large tea cup saucer, and is  totally awesome!   B- (with a nod and a wink)"It is the 'King of the belt buckles', that's for sure!" A- (jolly)"You're an all around guy, brother!" B- (gracious) "Thanks." A- (suddenly serious) "No.  I'm serious, brother.  You're an all around guy!  You got it together!" B- (uh. . .gracious?)"Thanks!"  It was inspiring to have someone that  I didn't even know  see so much potential in me.  To look me right in my belt buckle and know that I was a wonderful person.  I felt empowered.  I felt invincible!  I felt like the mighty  urlLink Mongoose --if the world ever bit me, I had the strength to bite it right back!

      After a lovely night at the movies, while I was attempting the cross John St. at King, I noticed a large Chevy Suburban making a left hand turn, and creeping closer and closer to me. The little white walking fella was lit up, so for once I was obeying the laws of the land, yet this Suburban was practically on top of me. I wasn't lollygagging, but I wasn't running.  A- (window down, music pumping, lots of girls inside)"Take your time, buddy." B- "Next time, just drive over me, jackass."  And, "Scene".

      The 1969 Ford Fairlane Ranchero I use as a sales vehicle is sick, and I had to take her to "the hospital". The "hospital" is, in reality, little more than a junk yard decorated with old school buses, a transport trailer that acts as an operating room, and the biggest mud puddle anyone has ever seen.  It is a place that little cars have nightmares about and middle age cars threaten to send their parents to--it's a place that, if I was a car, I would pray for death.  The "head doctor" at this facility is a charmer I'll call A.  He is 'on call' 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from his trailer on site.  A will never, ever,  ever  be clean again. When I first met him and held out my hand for a shake, A reached out, looked at his filthy little paw, gave it a  courtesy wipe  on his pants, then completed the greeting.  The irony is, if his hand had been clean to begin with, and he wiped it on his pants, I would have thought twice about shaking it. It's like cleaning an apple that fell into a Port-a-Potty with a dirty handkerchief.  Upon closer inspection of his hand, I noticed that one finger was considerably larger than the rest.  And oozing.  When asked, A replied:  A- "Oh, that.  I cut it with a saw, burnt it with a welding torch, and got a hot piece of metal in it, all in one day." Then, with a laugh, A- "The girlfriend loves it!" (thrusting his swollen finger into thin air rhythmically)  Girlfriend?  A then pointed out another finger which was slightly shorter than the rest.  A- "I broke that one eight months ago and just got the use of it back." B- "Did you go to the doctor?" A- "Nah.  One morning I was eating breakfast and a piece of bone fell out of it.  Hard piece bigger than a Tic Tac." B- "You should have gone to the doctor, pal!" A- "Nah.  What was he going to do?  I threw the bone out."  If it offends thee, wait for it to drop off.  Despite appearances, he does do a fine job. And anyone who will risk life and limb for the Ranchero can't be a bad dude; not on the inside.  Deep inside.  I will post when his romantic horizon opens up, for any of the single ladies out there looking for a project.

      Yesterday my fiance and I were enroute to Focaccia to sample their Summerlicious effort, when a man served up an amuse bouche of  urlLink  homme en chute al dente   to whet our appetite.  At Yonge, just south of Hayden St., a man literally sneezed himself off his own two feet, landing face first in the gutter.  I immediately thought:  Jeepers!  I'd hate to have allergies that bad!  And seriously considered helping him up.  He stood without my help, but just barely, and weeved his way south on Yonge.  The 'heel-toe' crossover he was using to walk robbed him of any elegance.  I immediately thought:  Jeepers!  I hate to be that drunk on Scope!  But something told me he didn't mind being that drunk on Scope.

      The other day I was strolling though Kensington Market in a vain effort to find sharkskin suits that fit me.  Most were either former closet dwellers of 'fat men with short arms', or 'tall men with long arms'--happily, I fall into the 'average men with mid-length arms'.  I was distracted from my search by a man sitting on the curb of Augusta Ave.; with no job to keep him chained to a desk, he was taking little advantage of the sunny day by sitting in the shade.  A- "Got some change?" B- "Sorry.  Not today." A- "Are you Jewish?" B- "No." A- "You look like you have a bit of Jew in you." B- "Nope.  I'm about as WASPy was they get." A- "You could pass for a Jew." B- ". . .thanks?"  I thought, originally, that the man was paying me a compliment.  I'm trying not to sound like a boor, but he  looked  more Jewish to me than, say, my identical twin brother.  I assumed that he was paying me a compliment, however strange, by suggesting that he and I were cut from the same cloth.  Assuming that he was Jewish.  And that I  look  Jewish.  It wasn't until I related the story to my brother, who promptly branded the man "an anti-Semitic ass" for suggesting that my thrift regarding panhandlers was related to some 'religious stereotype' typified by thrift, that I too thought the man an ass.  Had I realised where he was going, I would have drawn from my proud Christian tradition and burned him on a stake. Amen.

      After sliced bread, the next best thing ever conceived was a miniture, self-inflating  urlLink WHOOPIE CUSHION ! And I did just as the advertisment directs--I squeezed farts right out of the palm of my hand.  What awesome power!  On escaltors!  On elevators! On Jewish Seders!  I tooted wherever, and whenever, I pleased. And I usually followed the "Bronx cheer" with a few very audible sniffs while casting an accusitory glare meant to implicate any passerbys or fellow passengers. In elevators I recommend the following procedure: 1. Toot your mini whoopie cushion. 2. Give a digusted look at one passenger (A), who will no doubt try to ignore the goings-on. 3. Look at another passenger (B), smirk, roll your eyes, indicate the first passenger(A) with either your eyes, or a head nod in their direction, and "discretely" wave your hand beneath your nose.  Make sure that (A) catches you doing this.  The absolute best time I ever had was lying in wait in a public washroom at The Bay on Yonge St., hidden in a stall, biding my time until nature called someone.  Just as my victim began to relieve himself at the urinal, I let my mini Whoopie Cushion off its leash--toot--and followed it with the most agonizing moan of "Ohhh, God".  Immediately A stopped mid-stream for a listen.  I waited silently until the waterworks started up again, then--toot--followed by an even bigger moan, trying to make this one sound more worried and weary.  I took my inspiration from seeing (and hearing) a cow giving birth in the middle of the farmer's field across from my house.  Immediately A stopped his relief for a listen.  What morbid curiosity!   I let out another, smaller toot and was tempted to call for my "Mommy", but resisted.  A zipped up and fled, in his haste neglecting to wash his hands. I stood in my stall, exited, and after an approriate amount of time, exited the lavitory.  I suspected A of being cut from the same perverted cloth as I, so while I was exiting I quickly glanced around to see if anyone was paying special mind to the inhabitant of the can who had crapped himself within an inch of death.   A guy perusing frames glanced quickly at me, then back at the frames.  No guy is  that  interested in frames.

      A few years back I worked in the mighty Wisconsin North Woods at Chippewa Ranch Camp (an all-girls camp) and met a Texan. The Texan was the width of two axe handles across his ass, and easily one of the dumber specimens in the zoo of my life. I called him "The Walrus".  By the end of summer, he hated my guts, and had gambled his entire wage away on bartop Monte Carlo machines in a place called "Sportsman's Bar".  He owed the camp two hundred dollars by the end of August.  He was just an amazing beast.  On Canada Day my parents came to visit, and we were outside exhibiting our hearty Canadian spirit by standing and talking quietly and politely to one another, enjoying nature, and considering whether to go to the Rhinelander Rail Museum (we did).   The Walrus was in a jolly mood, swinging merrily on a rustic, tree-hung, swing, chatting up some pre-teen girls. Suddenly. A loud   CRACK!  . The sound of little girls crying. The sight of the Walrus, flat on his back, his chubby legs sticking out from the leaves of a broken tree branch now lying on the ground.  No one was hurt.  I think the girls were crying because the "old tree swing" was broken beyond repair.  My father summed up the event just as  Lorne Greene  might have reported it on CBC radio-- He turned to me, and in a grave tone said: "That fat guy just broke the branch off that tree."  He sure did.  Broke it real good.

      With a title like that, I'm afraid that the payoff won't satisfy.  I am proud to report that when I wrote the following lie I fully expected it to bear fruit. . .   "Alexander Graham Bell invented the Slinkey  In 1957 Alexander Graham Bell was flying a kite in a thunderstorm while enjoying a Coca Cola.

Two innocent Googlers  so far have happened upon my perversion of the great Yankee history books, and it is my hope that the number will climb to as high as five!  Hey, if it's okay for Americans to write their own history surrounding the War of 1812, then I see my action as simply following in the footsteps they left in the horseshit.

      My fiance works in a hospital's emergency room. The night shift. There is never a dull moment.  Like the time a girlfriend ran her boyfriend through with a samurai sword, then benevolently drove him to the hospital. Or the time she was nearly done registering a quiet, intense man, before noticing that he was being admitted for "Homicidal thoughts".  I like to pick her up from work whenever I'm not too busying partying or having a good time, because one never knows the type of person lurking about  outside  the hospital, considering that all the  responsible  crazies and invalids are safely registered inside.  On a recent visit I overheard, 'eavesdropped on' more like, two homecare workers that had brought their elderly homecare patient in due to "concern". It seems she was pale, cold to the touch, and wouldn't poo. But more importantly, as younger of the two pointed out:  A- "If she dies, I'd rather these doctors have to explain it."  Yes. Nothing kills the good times quicker than having to explain a body. Especially a body full of poo.  The older homecare worker comforted the younger with a sexy little tale from 'back in the day'.  C- "I was working at a nursing home, and some of those men were absolutely wicked. If they offered me a chocolate I never took it, because one time I did and the old bugger grabbed me by my uniform and tore it right off of me!"  A- "NO!"  C- "Yes! He was a sex maniac! He was sex crazy! I tried not to go too close to any of those men again."  I can't imagine there are many bed-ridden septuagenarian sex maniacs out there; if she didn't exaggerate, and really turned his head as she said, she must be an extraordinary woman! A virtual Viagra on heels!  I stole a peek.  She was not.  Then I began to wonder how effectively one can care for another over a six foot void. If you threw too many air balls, a patient could go without medication for a week.

      My corpulent Texan friend, the Walrus, had never, ever captained a kayak before; however, "degree of experience" wasn't a consideration for him when deciding to make his maiden voyage a solo one.  If you read no further, know that one should never go out in a kayak, for the first time, alone.  Especially  if one's tummy is liable to get stuck inside the portal of the kayak.  While driving a party boat full of pre-teen girls over to a lakeside bar for pizza (I know how that sounds, but it was for pizza, and pizza alone) we toddled past the Walrus in his kayak. He looked more like he was wrestling with, rather than operating, the paddle. Having never seen a Texan paddle before, this was my amateur opinion. The zipper on his life jacket was showing signs of fatigue.  I am not strong in problems dealing with Physics, but if a fully-loaded party boat can best a kayak in the momentum department, something is amiss. Instead of "The tortoise and the Hare", it was "The tortoise and the Turtle".  When I asked if he needed any help, my voice straining to be heard over the indiscreet whispers and giggles of my pre-teen passengers, the Walrus took a page from the screenplay of "Falling Down" and answered only with a steely glare fixed on the horizon. He was either: 1) deep in contemplation, for at the time the WWF(sic) RAW storyline concerning Stone Cold Steve Austin was particularly complex; 2) deep in psychosis, caused by acute stupidity.  We chugged on to the bar for pizza, leaving behind the Walrus, the paddle, the kayak, and the life jacket locked in a dead heat for which one would give up first.  Two pizzas in, with some girls opting to pick off all the toppings on their slices and eat them, and some picking all the toppings off and eating only the crust, we were relaxed and having a good time. The bar was decorated liberally with animals (mostly baby black bears) that had been hit by cars and then stuffed and twisted into idyllic pastoral scenes as if to give them a new lease on life. The stuffed fish even had synthesised slime drooling out of their little gaping maws. It was Norman Bates' America as it would have appeared on the Saturday Evening Post.  I left for the john, and when I came back there was, what appeared to be, a series of dead jellyfishes lying on the floor. They were dirty, wet footprints. Big fat ones.  The bartender called to me: A- "You're from the camp? Some fat guy broke the dock and sunk his boat. Got my floor all wet." B- "Really?" I was trying not to laugh. "Sorry about the floor. . .and the dock."  So down I went, to the disabled dock, where my girls were gathered around the Walrus. He was wet from the tip of his toes to the top of his Arizona Diamondbacks cap. As I passed other boats moored along the part of the dock still standing I could hear men laughing and retelling the story of how "that fat guy. . .broke the dock"! I wanted to stop and ask for details. I could see the story of "The Walrus and the Dock" fast becoming a legend--an Aesopian tale of caution--and I wanted to get all the juicy facts.  It was a picture that I wish I had. The Walrus dripping wet, standing barefoot on a half-submerged dock, with a large yellow kayak, also half-submerged, gently knocking on the dock like the Tell-tale heart. CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK. I know what you did. CLUNK. CLUNK. CLUNK.  B- "You know, this looks like a perfect example of an Incorrect Docking Procedure, girls." W- Nothing. Girls- (tittering) B- "Need a hand? Where's your sandals?" W- (pause) "The bottom of the lake." B- "The bottom of the. . .how'd they get there?" W- "The dock broke and I fell in." B- "What happened to the kayak?" W- "Help me get it out of the water." B- "Don't you know how to un-swamp your own kayak? It's a one man job." W- "Just help me pull it out." B- "You shouldn't go kayaking across the lake alone if you don't know basic kayaking procedures." W- "Just help me get it out of the water." B- "Okay. Go back to the bar, girls, and wait for us there. These docks are unsafe--they collapse without warning."  Once we were alone, I showed the Walrus how dead easy it was to pull a swamped kayak onto a dock to empty it. He watched from a safe distance while I worked. Through questioning I discovered that he had only made it  halfway  out of the kayak before the dock collapse, and thus all three (kayak, Walrus, and dock) had ended up in Sandy Lake.  B- "Now let's find your sandals. They're rubber, and should be floating around here somewhere." W- "No. They sunk into the mud under the dock and came off my feet." B- "So. . .? Let's get them!" W- "Forget it; let's go back to camp." B- "It'll only take a minute to get your sandals. Give me your paddle."  So I poked around in the muddy lake bottom until I felt some resistance that could have been sandals.  B- "There! Jump in and pull them out!" W- "There's leaches!" B- "There's no leaches! Kids are swimming in this lake every day! Go in and get them."  I'll never forget the sight, till the day I die, of the reluctant Walrus, his face barely above the water line, groping around the lake bottom looking for his sandals in locations I chose based on poking a kayak paddle into the muck. He made this "Gah! Gah! Gah!" noise while he worked that made each breath sound like it would be his last. And as if he hadn't suffered enough indignity, I took an opportunity I could not pass up. Pointing at a piece of lake dirt that had stuck to his neck as it bobbed up and down I exclaimed, "What's  THAT !"  Everything went just as my wicked little mind had planned; that is until, in his spastic rush to escape the leaches, he beached himself on the dry bit of dock I was standing on and broke it. I joined my pal in the leach-infested Sandy Lake.  The party boat cruised into camp with more passengers than it left with, and two of them were soaked. And the moral of the story? All good Aesop fables have a moral!   If a dock will not hold a Walrus; it certainly won't hold a Walrus and a Jackass.

      Acting, as a profession, isn't generally bad for your health.  The late nights spent drinking, smoking, and carousing can occasionally have restorative powers.   Auditions can wear on a fella.  My most recent audition was especially draining.  A popular gum company is creating an ad campaign for their new mint.  During the course of my audition I ate several of these mints, the routine being: Shake mint into hand. Pop mint into mouth. Deep breath in (with sound). Look right and say, "Hmmmmmmmm!". Look left and say, "Refreshing!!"  About 12 mints or so into my "performance" the adjudicator stopped me to say:  A- "Oooh!  The Brand X guys told us to tell the actors not to eat too many of the mints. . .they, uh, cause, uh,  may  cause diarrhea.  So you likely shouldn't eat any more."  I can confirm, for the sake of posterity, that by the time he had voiced the concern of Brand X, it was already too late. One would think that an overdose of diarrhetic mints would have a pleasant, refreshing sensation on the posterior, coupled with a minty freshness in the bowl. One would be wrong.  My Toilet Duck resigned, and I think that the resident Mr. Clean will spawn retarded children.      This is my Agent Orange fiasco.

      We all have something in our life that takes us back to a time when things seemed simpler.  The smell of a fresh baked apple pie.  The feel of sunlight on skin.  The sound of kids at play in the park.  For some of us, those memories are the only things in our lives that bring us joy, make us feel happy, young, and invincible again.  The Ranchero is this to many many men. And one of them works at the Executive Car Wash.  While I waited behind the glass of the car wash lobby for The Darkness to set upon the industrial dryer, I watched the art of Chamois Man.  His lythe ponytail seemed light as air, flitting from one shoulder to the next like a big hairy butterfly.  It did not betray the sadness of the Chamois Man, whose skin was much thinner, I would find out, than the delicate, though durable hyde of his chamois. I turned my back but for a moment, and missed something--a spark! My imagination has set to work on conjuring the moment up in my mind's eye, but I don't think even the greatest Irish poets working 'round the clock with the most skilled French painters, could capture the moment my Chamois Man met my Ranchero.  I don't think that they would know how to paint "Boo-yah!"; I don't think they would be able to rhyme "Boo-yah!".  But if they could, they'd be millionaires.  A- "Boo-yah!  Boo-yah!  Boo-yah!  Boo-yah!"  A bellowed each exclamation louder and louder, hopping on one foot, the other cocked up close to his body--he looked like a grungy Arsenio Hall,  if  Arsenio had been a flamingo.  And with each exclaim he pumped his fist into the air. He stopped. But it was only to swish his ponytail from side to side--HE WAS--NO!--It appeared that he was whinnying like a stallion! SWISH!  went his mane! SWISH! it went again! This was no Flamingo Arsenio!  This was  urlLink Andalusian Arsenio !  The older Chamois Guy asked me, calmly, was The Darkness a '68. No.  A '69. Was it pretty fuckin sweet? Yes.  It was.  A came up to me, eyes twinkling.  A- "That car is fucking awesome!  I never owned one, but I drove a lot of them!" (and a knowing wink)  I wasn't sure what the knowing wink was for; had he stolen a lot of Rancheros as a kid, or did his father own a dealership, or did perhaps in dreams he was cowboy that rode wild Rancheros at the rodeo--I don't know.  Then things got serious.  A- "You know, that car--it takes me back.  You know, to a time when I was young and a somebody.  I was having a pretty fuckin' bad life since then--until you drove in here--and now, I feel awesome!  Thanks man!"  . . .and so Ranchero of Arimathea placed her sun visor on the leg of the cripple, and he walked; on the eyes of the blindman, and he saw; on the head of the Chamois Man, and he remembered.  And God looked down, and saw what good the Ranchero had done, and said that She may sit at His right hand forever and an eternity.  His Son could sit in the back seat."

      My brother lives in New Toronto across the street from a man who proudly wears the moniker of "Neighbourhood Drunk".  People new in the neighbourhood of New Toronto receive a visit, my brother told me, from this man, so that he can state  for the record , and  in no uncertain terms  that he is  beyond a shadow of a doubt   the  "Neighbourhood Drunk". Then, later in the evening, he'll come back and say, in confidence, that he isn't that much of a drunk--it's the bastards across the street that tell everyone he is.  And so it is into this neighbourhood I mixed the Ranchero, my Heart of Darkness.  The "Neighbourhood Drunk", Drunk A, used what was left of his legs to get over to my open window.  They may have been crooked like a dog's hind legs, but he could get around on them pretty well, so long as he had a target to work towards and lean on when he arrived.  A- "That is. . .I'm not a homosexual.  Okay?  But your car has given me the biggest boner I have ever had.  Seriously.  It's given me a huge fuckin' erection.  What a fuckin' car!" B- "Thank you.  It is pretty sweet."  More drunk talk followed, of which I listen to very little.  The Heart of Darkness receives so much admiration from guys down on their luck, on a daily basis, who ask all the same questions and tell me what a fine fuckin' machine she is, that I've started to go on auto-pilot.   I'm guessing Steve Gutenberg has begun to do the same thing when people start asking him about what projects he's been working on lately--so I'm in good company.  I go in to my brother's house, which is surrounded by a white picket fence (literally) and dig in to my delicious meal.  My sister-in-law is pretty handy around the kitchen.  About twelve bites in, we hear the white picket fence latch open, and across the yard a shadow looms.  The shadow's legs are crooked like a carpenter's square. It's Drunk A. I'm wondering if he's representing the role of "Neighbourhood Drunk" or "Not Nearly the Neighbourhood Drunk" right now.  When he opens the door, the trail of urine staining his jogging pants shorts tells me that clearly, he is either quite drunk, or has a prostate problem.   Seeing as his opening line was NOT:  A- "Hey guys, can I come in.  I just got some bad news from my urologist...I have a lazy prostate!"  But was instead:  A- "Guys, I'm sorry, but that car--if it was a chick I'd fuck it!  I've got a big--sorry ladies--guys, you know what I mean.  It's fucking hot!!"  Then he started doing something that I do fairly often.  He made an "OK" sign with his hand, pressing his thumb and index finger together, and splaying the rest of his fingers like a peacock's tail, and started smacking his lips to make a kiss-kiss sound.  And he did it, and did it, and did it, until everyone in the room was uncomfortable.  Except me.  I was trying to figure out if this display meant that I could no longer do the "OK" kiss-kiss action myself.  Did this spectacle ruin it?  A left, kiss-kissing all the way to the curb.   I decided that it was still a useful act to resort to when words describing the fine quality of something failed me.  When I left, call it Monica Lewinski-like foresight, but I gave the exhaust pipe a real good looking over.  I'm going to put it in the back of my closet and bide my time.

      Any "Star Wars" nerd will tell you that a tractor beam is "an invisible force beam that drags objects from place to place", but only I will tell you that those nerds are wrong. Wrong wrong wrong.  A tractor beam does not necessarily have to be "invisible".  In fact, a tractor beam can be quite visible.  It can also have a black metallic finish with red decal racing stripes, and a pair of dangly black fuzzy dice.  The scene: 6am-Parkdale The players: myself (B); early morning traffic; one guy having his morning coffee.  'Morning coffee' might not be totally true; someone as drunk as he was likely hadn't gone to sleep yet, making his coffee more of an apretif.  Anyway. I pull up to a red light on Queen and begin waiting my turn.  To my left I hear an un-Godly exclaimation, and turn to see this man eject himself from the greasy spoon he was sobering up in, still holding his cup of java, and begin across the street towards me. The Ranchero had him locked in a tractor beam.  I've seen it happen before. Drunk A stumbled infront of a moving car, which honked, to which he saluted with an upturned middle finger, in turn spilling coffee on his own arm.  He stumbled to an eerie stillness outside my passenger window, a watery thousand-yard stare fixed in my direction ("watery" because the cigarette in his mouth was issuing smoke into his eyes, imparing his admiring gaze).  A pursed his lips and plucked the cigarette from its resting place.  Then, with the hand holding the cigarette, he placed it gently on the chrome moulding around the window and slowly began to trace its elegant curve.  The expression on his faced matched one I'd seen in a movie from the Forties, where this guy watched the mirrored reflection of a woman in her bedroom putting on silk stockings. Forbidden sensual delight.   His caress went from the window moulding, to the chrome running the length of the cruck's box.  The expression on his face made me thankful that the cruck stood just high enough to mask the erection surely straining his britches.  The light turned green, and like a stern father who's heart is hardened by the loss of a wife and now stands mute in the face of Aphrodites' work, I stepped on the pedal and demanded The Ranchero leave her lover behind.  The chrome sped out from under A's hand, and there was a second where he stood in the middle of the street as if the cruck was still there, purring underhand--then he looked up to the silhouette of his ever-fading love, staining his eyes to cut through the early morning smog of the city, wishing that life were different.  Wishin' that things hadn't turned out like this--drunk in the morning, a daughter that doesn't speak to him, no hope of realising his full potential, AND A CAR HONKING ITS HORN.  My rear view-finder painted a picture of loss: A was fighting with the horn-blower, the spell of the Ranchero broken.  The bumper sticker on the car ahead? "You can have my Ranchero when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!"  There's a little picture of a skelton with a Rebel flag waving in a wind of flames. Cool.

      Most days I get from A to B in a Fairlane Ranchero.  To the people of Riverdale's Ass, who's wake-up call is the opening chords of Mr. Jon Bon Jovi's cover of 'Keep on Rockin' in the Free World' tuned well above legal limits (my opinion), this is not news.  The Ranchero's devil-may-care attitude towards convention--it's striking refusal to be labeled neither car nor truck--has drawn me a lot of attention.  Sometimes good.  Sometimes bad.  Yesterday morning, it was somewhere between good and bad.  It was "The Man".  Roaring down the Queensway, The Ranchero (henceforth referred to as 'The Heart of Darkness', or any part thereof) was urging me to press its accelerator harder.  The 'burbs is no place for a 302 small V8 engine.  I would have obeyed, save the appearance of a copper pulling out of Licks Burger.  B- "I smell chicken.  I smell pork.  Run piggy, run piggy!  I've got a fork. . .in the shape of Bruce Springsteen's Live album."  I nodded my head in time to the music, rolling past the cop not too fast, but also not too slow--just right.  He pulled in behind me and stayed close on my rear.  I looked casually in my rear view-finder.   He was typing on his computer. He was looking at me. He was typing on his computer. He was turning his lights on. He was blasting his siren. I, in my naivete, made eye contact with the cop, pointing at myself, then pointed at him, as if to say, "Me?  Mais non!  Me!  Shit."  We pull over.  The Darkness was frustrated; told me to run.  Told me, "What about 'the stuff' you got behind the seat!!" I told The Darkness adjustable vise-grips and two sleeves of Steam Whistle coasters were not enough to get me thrown in jail.  He was calling for backup. I was trying to turn down my Springsteen, but the radio was locked in my glovebox.  I was afraid that Officer A would suppose my awkward fumbling for the glovebox as an attempt to attempt to murder a cop.  'American Skin' was blaring--an eerie warning from the Boss to let the music stand.  The cop approached.  A- "license, insurance, and ownership." B- "Certainly."  I gave him my license, insurance, and the original bill of sale dated August 12th, 1969.  A- "What's this?" (referring to the bill of sale) B- "It's the original bill of sale." A- "I don't want that; I want the ownership." B- "I figured that the bill of sale would prove that since it was bought, it was owned."  pause.  A- "Is this your name.  'Bradley David Goddard'?" B- "Yes.  Is there something wrong, officer?"  He hadn't told me why we were meeting yet.  A- "Yes.  I ran this plate, and it is licensed to Mr. C (not his real name).  Mr. C is a prohibited driver.  If I find that you are Mr. C, I'm takin' you in." B- "Mr. C owns the car.  I am Mr. B, the driver.  Mr. C is a prohibited driver because he's in a wheelchair and can't feel his feet." A- "The computer doesn't mention that information." B- "Well, take it from me then.  I'm not surprised he's a prohibited driver; I wouldn't take a ride from him if he offered it." A- "Stay here."  He left for his car, to run my license through his computer.  Even if he hadn't suggested it, I would have likely stayed put anyway.  Officer A came back after a few minutes and told me that I could go.  I thanked him for keeping our streets safe, slid my aviator glasses back on, and shoved The Heart of Darkness in Drive just in time to hear the Boss advise "Baby, we were born to run!"   I must just look guilty. Like in "American Graffiti", where the cops hassle the kids with the hot cars just for kicks.  This exchange was reminiscent of a time not too long ago when two officers of the law stopped me on the street, at gunpoint, because my duck-like gait smacked a little too much like Al Qaida.  But that's another story. . .
