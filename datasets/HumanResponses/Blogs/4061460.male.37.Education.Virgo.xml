						   I spent a lot of time today scouring through photo albums for pictures that I could use on my web site. I came up with about eleven good ones. I still incorporated all of them, but I definitely have most of them up. I also lengthened the section on my web site that kind of covers my past. That is where most of the pics went.  I also took the kids to go see  I, Robot . It was better than I thought it would be. The story was good, and it kept me guessing as to who the real bad guy was. The cinematography was impressive, and Will Smith was very cool.  I have had this crazy desire for Oreintal Chicken Salads from Applebee's lately. I have wanted one for a couple weeks now, so today I broke down and ordered some carry-out. It was soooo good. I'll have to go back next week.

						   I got quite a bit done today. I put enough content (including a message board) on my web site that I feel it is worth looking at. I picked up a textbook for my Freshman class that I am pleased with. I even got in all of my Bible study. I need to get serious on my syllabi pretty soon.  The kids and I had an opportunity to go out to lunch with Cindy today. All of us really enjoy that. Too bad we don't have more opportunites to do so.

						   Last night, my wife and I had a small argument. It wasn't anything big - we didn't even raise our voices - but it was enough to put me off of my game today. I have been cranky to everyone pretty much all day. I hate when I feel like this. Thankfully, Cindy (my wife) and I were able to sit down this afternoon and have a nice talk. Last night's&nbsp;discussion never even came up, but it helped just to have a cordial conversation.  I didn't get as much done today as&nbsp;I would have liked (isn't that always the case?). I went to pick up my class sets of novels from the distributor, but he didn't have any of them in (even though he specifically told me to come pick them up today). Instead, he told me they won't be in until late next week. He's a very nice (and talkative) guy, so I guess I don't mind waiting.   I was able to start my website and am very excited to announce the existence of  urlLink www.misterwoods.com . It won't be up for a couple of days, which is good because I haven't generated much content for it yet.  I also got some reading in and competently picked up my children from their respective camps. I haven't done my Bible study yet, so I better do that next.  This afternoon,&nbsp;I dropped by the school. I was hoping to run into Ms. Furnari (one of our assistant principals) to talk to her about getting a different textbook for my Freshman English class. Registration was going on, so it was a terrible time for me to "pop in." I never did find her and didn't bother asking around for her because I was sure she was very busy. Still, it made me stop and consider myself and my status. I wonder what the administrators think of me when I come to them. Are they at all happy to see me or do they think that I am just one more problem for them to deal with? All of them are wonderful at their jobs and always treat me kindly and with respect, but I can easily imagine them cringing whenever they see me approach. I wonder how I can fix that? I would love to have a better relationship with all of them, but that takes time and that is one thing that I already think I am taking too much from them. We'll see how this year goes. I'll be able to be more involved this year and hopefully that will lead to better relations.

						    In just a couple of weeks I will be teaching a Freshman English course at Fort Dorchester High School in North Charleston, SC. I plan on having my students keep a blog to go along with their reading of the diary/novel  Go Ask Alice . Honestly, I have never "blogged" before. In fact, all of my attempts at keeping a journal have been dismal failures, so I hope my students will help keep me accountable by checking up on me every once in awhile as they write in their "blogs."    &nbsp;  I will be giving more info about myself on this blog in the future (on slow news days), but today I need to go pick up my kids from basketball and cheerleading camps, do my Bible study, read some more, go pick up some class sets of novels, start to work on my syllabus for the upcoming semester, begin to create a web site for my classes, and hopefully get in a little  Star Wars Galaxies  before my wife gets home from work.    &nbsp;  Hopefully, I will add to this blog tonight and tell you how my day went.

						   Today went extremely well. I had the opportunity to see some people coming into my class with bad attitudes and walk out feeling like this might be an interesting semester and that they were capable of success. I only did one really stupid thing. I misplaced my syllabus for the 12 TP class. I knew that I had it, but when it came time to hand it out, it was gone. Turned out it was about 6" left of where I thought it should be and somehow just couldn't find it. I have no idea why stuff like that hppens to me.  I really want to make this semester as good of one as is possible, but of course they can only get out of what what they put in. Here's hoping they put forth an effort.  My kids all seemed to have good days at school today. Catherine complained that her social studies teacher is mean, but she apparently is hapy with the others.

						   Well, school starts tomorrow. I am excited and a little nervous. I think I have everything ready, but what if I forgot something essential? There's nothing I can do about it if I did, but it is still a source of frustration and anxiety. It's like the old "did I leave the oven on?" bit.  I did sneak in a little  Star Wars Galaxies  today. I don't know why though. That game gets more and more boring every time I get on there.I guess it's a decent time waster though.  Oh, I finally had a chance to watch  Reservoir Dogs  last night. Wow, it was so Shakespearean! Sharp dialogue, witty repartee, plenty of blood and gore. I was even thinking it would make a great play. Just use the warehouse scenes and amplify them with some more dialogue explaining what occured after the jewelry heist.  I have to go back to class next Saturday and I am not looking forward to it. I haven't quite finished my homework yet, and with school in full swing I will have a difficult time focusing on it. Teaches me right for procastinating, I guess.

						   I finally worked all of the kinks out of my website. I also updated my page of the school web site. While I was into the whole web thing, I found some great info on business letters that I will use in my classes this coming week.  Cindy did some furniture shopping today in downtown Summerville and picked up a bed, a desk, and three dining room chairs. The girls and I went to Beech Hill and shot some baskets this afternoon.

						   This is the first Friday of the new school year and the last Friday before the students come back. I am very excited about this school year. I have a few of the same students that I had last year, but we will all be starting out with a clean slate this time around.  I stayed late at school the last two days, so when I got everything done that I needed for this coming week, I felt no guilt at all leaving a bit early today. I finished and printed my syllabi for both classes, made seating charts (hopefully, my class rosters won't change too much now), and learned to operate the laser disc player I need for my 12th grade class. I still don't have my novels that I need for my Freshman classes yet. I'll have to take care of that next. I still have a couple days before I need them, but I'm starting to panic a bit.  I'm going to do everything I can to maintain this positive attitude. Hopefully, a positive Mr. Woods will translate into positive students. I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Cindy mentioned that she might like to go to the movies tonight if she gets off work soon enough. We still haven't watched Spiderman 2, so I imagine that will be our choice.

						   Yesterday was the last day of my summer vacation. I took the kids out to McDonald's, we made yet another attempt at securing some novels for my Freshman class from the distributor, and then went to see "The Village." The movie was interesting and enjoyable, but seemed to stall towards the end. Of course it had the traditional Shyamalan moment where at one point you are given all of the clues to the suprise ending that he has been hinting towards throughout the entire film, which is still rewarding, but starting to grow a little thin.  Today all of the teachers returned to school. I was happy to see evryone and was somewhat surprised that everyone semed happy to see me. I still see myself as a bit of an outsider there, but I guess nobody else thinks of me that way. I finally got to work on my syllabi, and I did some editting to my web page. It never occured to me that I developed my wen page while looking at a 17" monitor and most of the school's monitors are 15". Of course this ends up making the page look goofy on the smaller monitor, so I need to fix that.  We have two new members to our department, Ms. Tanner and Ms. Robinson. They both seem to have a lot of experience at other high schools. We also have a new administrator, Ms. Jennings, and she seems very sharp. I am looking forward to working with her. She has the kind of demeanor where she is very sweet, but you get the impression that if she had to discipline you for some reason, she could really lay the lumber.

						   I went into school today, and Ms. Randall told me that I will be losing one of my TP 12 classes during second semester and picking up a CP 3 class instead. This probably doesn't sound like a big deal at all, but sometimes I feel like I get crapped on a lot. I'm the only teacher in the history of the school that has been devoid of a classroom for two consecutive years. When choosing our preferences for planning periods, all I asked for was "not 2nd block." I ended up with 2nd period planning both semesters. None of it alone is any big deal, but I sometimes wonder why I alone am expected to make these sacrifices. Why couldn't I sacrifice a little here and someone else sacrifice a little there so that none of us are entirely burdened. Some teachers feel they are already sacrificing a lot by allowing a teacher to float into their room, and I can understand how they would feel that is an inconvenience, but I think I would be pretty happy to change positions with them. I also know there are some teachers who are sacrificing nothing.  There's no use grumbling and groaning about it though. It's much better to focus on how good I have it than how poor some things seem to be. Still, it's nice to vent a little bit, and this seems like a reasonably safe place to do so.

						   The kids had their lists of school supplies, and I had a lot of materials that I needed, so Cindy and I packed up the crew and headed to Staples. I know it is dorky, but I get a big charge out of new school supplies. I ended up creating six seperate "kits" of supplies for group work. I also ended up with a new stapler (works like a staple gun), tape dispenser, paper clip holders, folders, and stuff I may never need.  Jack went and got his hair cut. He got the "Caeser," and he looks very sharp. I kind of had to talk him into it, but he loves it now.  Next, we all went and got shoes. I got two pair of dress shoes - one brown, one black. They are quite comfortable and looks nice also - not too dressy, but not casual.  We couldn't decide whether we were going to have lunch next or just have ice cream. Of course we settled the matter by having both. We're Americans. Thats' what we do. Any guesses as to why I am forty pounds overweight?  Church today was nice, but tonight's Bible study was a bit boring. I hate when instructors just prattle on for endless minutes and then ask, "Well, what do you guys think?" By that point no one is in conversation mood, so we all just sit there and stare, which the instructor feels is his indicator to keep talking. Students, stop me when/if I do this!
