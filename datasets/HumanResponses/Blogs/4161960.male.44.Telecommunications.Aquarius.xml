Instead it comes across as over-produced smarmy pop with an overblown title and bad cover art to boot. This is the one D2 album I hardly ever listen to. "The Reflex" is a promising start, but fair warning, the album mix is distinctly different from the Nile Rodgers produced single remix that hit #1 on the charts. "New Moon On Monday" is okay, but then the tracks descend into insincere pop inanity. "Cracks in the Pavement" and "I take the Dice" are pure pablum filler. Side one grinds to a close with "Of Crime And Passion", a song trying so hard to be edgy it ultimately spins off the 'ol turntable. "Union of the Snake" is solid chart material, the strongest song with a solid Bowie bass beat, excellent percussion and some good horn work. "Shadows On Your Side" comes off as an overdone uptempo number that seems to get to the chorus inside of 10 seconds and repeat it every 30 seconds thereafter. The band finally take a breath and stretch their creativity on "Tiger Tiger", an evocative instrumental number that leads in to the big finish "The Seventh Stranger", which is one of my favorite ballad/atmospheric numbers from the band, and Andy Taylor's guitar solo theme work is gorgeous. The album ends abruptly, far short of it's intended goal. This album needs a serious "Director's Cut" style updating from Nick and Simon to bring it back to respectability. If they had included the "Is There Something I Should Know" single, the outstanding B-side "Secret Oktober" and the remixed single version of "The Reflex" they might have had something. Buy this version only if you have to have it to complete your collection.  And that's The Bottom Line

      Saw "The Bourne Supremacy" tonight.  I'd give it a solid 3 stars.  Matt Damon continues to impress in his most "meaty" role to date as Jason Bourne; half lost soul, half trained killer.  Damon does an excellent job of balancing the duality of his character and the stresses it places on Bourne's psyche.  Joan Allen gives a good supporting performance as a CIA director who is hunting Bourne.  Without giving away any major plot points, The Bourne Supremacy features a soild cast, good plotting, great action scenes (especially a tunnel chase sequence near the end of the film),  great locations (Berlin, Moscow, India) and just enough character advancement to keep me entertained and engaged throughout.  Well worth the full ride fare to see it in theaters.  And that's The Bottom Line
