      ahhhh...a nice end to a long, yet fruitful day.  my dad-in-law and i got the rest of the garden planted which is awsome.  our tomatoes are starting to fruit and the peppers as well.  i was eating some of the radishes as we planted the onions and peas.  after that we got together with the neighbors and built a shooting range and of course we had to test it out.  700 rounds later we decided to bbq some tri-tip with mesquite and applewood.  i don't think i've ever had such delicious food.  ok maybe...but not in a while. anyway, now i'm enjoying a cold beer and waiting for the wife to come home from work.  i think i'm going to call it for tonight and get into bed with some good reading.  or maybe i'll work on writing one of the books i'm never going to finish.  who knows?  maybe i'll decide to do something completely different.      mood: relaxed and happy      music: "Glad That It's Over" -12 Rods-

           well, here i am.  not sure what i'm doing here yet but i'm sure it'll come to me sooner or later.  maybe havin a beer would help.  we'll find out i guess.  so i'm tring this out as an experiment in writing and meeting new folks.  i love both and so i thought i could combine them somehow into this one endevor.  it's kind of exciting but at the same time i'm kind of directionless, so it's a bit disconcerting as well.  i guess i'll just write about day to day stuff or maybe put some of my short stories on here or something.  we'll see.        so i guess some of u folks are wonderin who i am exactly.  i hope anyway, lol.  then again, maybe your not.  but if u are then here it goes.      i'm 25 years old, about 6 foot one, 210 pounds, i have blue or green eyes (depending on who's looking), i have brown hair (when i let it grow), and i've been told that i smile a lot.  i'm easy going, though some call it lazy, and i get along with most everyone i've ever met (there are a few exceptions).  i'm a bit sarcastic and enjoy dry subtle humor.  i love music and am currently trying to learn the bass.  i love stand up comedy and watching movies, on dvd or video, not at the theater.  i enjoy hunting, fishing and camping, and spend most of my time outdoors or on the computer.  i hate the television.  i'm a veteran of the us army and am currently a student working towards my degree.  i've been married for three years now to my high school girlfriend whom i began dating nine years ago.  we have no children...yet.  i live in northern california in a small town north of san francisco called ukiah.  i work as a refrigeration engineer at the largest pear packing plant in the world, alex r thomas & company.        i guess that's a rough intro to me and my world.  it's a lot more involved than i could ever fit into one intro so i guess i'll elaborate in future posts or if someone asks me to.        anyway, i'm gonna wrap this one up now since i have plans to go four wheelin with my brother-in-law and then shooting later on with the father-in-law.  maybe i'll get some bbq stuff and cook a good lunch.  we'll see...
