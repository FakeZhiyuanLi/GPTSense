						    I understand that you need to advertise your name if you want people to recognize it.  This is the same for businesses as it is for the potential MLAs.  What I don't understand is why the candidates have a lot more freedom when it comes to placing signs everywhere than businesses do.    I am sure that many, if not all businesses in the Lower Mainland would love to be able to buy 5000 signs for 10 cents each and place them at every intersection and down the side of every major street.  If they were so brazen, they would be smacked with hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fines.  Nobody seems to mind that the political candidates do it, and do it to extremes that are now becoming quite silly.  In a democratic society, it is important that every voter knows all of his/her options.  Posting signs on the street definitely lets you see the names of your candidates at a reasonable cost to them.  I am not against these signs in general, but we need to enforce some common sense because they are obviously incapable of doing it themselves.  In a 20 meter stretch of road I have seen 20 to 30 identical signs.  What benefit does anyone see to having a wall of signs posted on both sides of a street?  We have some of the most beautiful scenery in the entire world here and these signs simply take away from the greenery that we all love to see.  If the signs are designed correctly, a driver should be able to glance at it for 1 second and completely understand the message that the sign is supposed to deliver.  The only real message I see on any of these signs is "Bill is the Liberal one" and "Jimmy is the conservative one".  Since everyone knows the colour red is used by the liberal party, and the conservative party uses the colour blue this message is very simple to get across.           There Aught to be a Law  We should have a rule that I will call "The Line of Sight Rule".  This would state that a political sign may be placed anywhere that you cannot already see a sign from the same party.  You should be able to stand beside any one of these signs, and not see another one.  This would have 2 benefits that I see; we would no longer have these ugly clusters of tens of signs right beside each other, and it should encourage creative placement of the signs to ensure they get the attention desired.   Am I the only one that sees a problem with all these signs?

						   It is election time in Canada, so we have to put up with listening to these windbags again.  Paul Martin decided the best time for him to try and get his point across would be during game one of the final of Lord Stanley's Cup.  First off, I will start by saying that turned out to be a pretty intelligent move since there were 35 million viewers of that game, second most in CBC Hockey Night history.  I am going to post his little speech that us taxpayers paid for and I will add my comments in italics.   "Now, you can have a country like Canada, or you can have a country like the U.S., but you cannot have a country like Canada with the taxation levels of the U.S."   Is he implying that us Canadians want to be Americans?  Nothing against the Americans, but who in the hell wants to be an American?  Lets see: their economy is crap, almost the entire world hates them, they are fat, and they run around with guns shooting each other when they are not watching reality TV shows and cramming McDonald's down their throats.  I don't think the situation in America has much to do with taxes, whether high or low.  Every single Canadian I know is very proud to be Canadian whether they are young, old, born Canadian, or just recently moved here.  Mr.  Martin, you have just finished your first sentence and you have already pissed me off.    "Not without risking the various social programs, institutions and values that make us...Us."   The social programs that our federal government supports are the "Buy the votes from Quebec foundation" and the "Keep the unemployed Newfies drunk initiative".  We all know the institutions they support are marketing firms, themselves, and other various buddies and cronies.    "We look out for one another, that is the Canada we choose: prosperous, but generous of spirit. "   Yes, you guys do look out for one another.  "Here, have 500 million dollars courtesy of our taxpaying populace, which doesn't include us because we write the rules so they do not pertain to us."    "We hope that is the Canada you choose too."   To be honest, nothing of any value was said in the whole speech.  The guy is a buffoon and he was never chosen in an election to run our country.  Sad thing is I probably will vote Liberal because the  other fools are far worse.   Update: I have had a slight change of heart since I wrote this and it looks like the Conservative fools may not be as bad as I originally thought.  Only time will tell...

						    We have only 5 days left before the Federal Election.   urlLink Here is an excellent site  to see where the parties stand on the major issues.  A couple of interesting things to note that are not on the site:  Layton and Martin claim that Harper wants to make abortions and gay marriages illegal and let everyone have an unregistered gun.  They also say that it is impossible for his economic plan to work.  Martin is painted by Harper as fiscally inept and corrupt.  Harper recently claimed that Martin supports very lax laws on child pornography.  Not too long ago, Layton accused Martin's budgets of being responsible for the deaths of homeless people.  The Bloc and Green Party do not deserve any of my time since they have no impact on anything important.  I only mentioned Layton of the NDP here because he talks a lot, not because his party has a chance of winning the election.  I enjoy the dirty political campaigns and mud-slinging.  They are a very important part of Canadian politics.  Without them, we would be forced to base our votes on the credibility of the candidates and the facts presented by them.

						    "We must all fear evil men. But there is another kind of evil that we must fear most. . . and that is the indifference of good men." 
 -The Boondock Saints   I spent Father's Day on the beach in Harrison Hot Springs with Lydia & Ash (my wife and son).  We were on the quiet side of the beach, but there were 30 or so other people nearby.  While we were enjoying the sunshine and eating some fries, Lydia says "That guy over there is drowning!".  I looked out onto the lake and saw nothing out of the ordinary. "I am sure everything is fine", I replied. I thought to myself that someone else would have already jumped in to save anyone in trouble.  It turns out I was wrong.  Lydia pointed him out to me a second or two later.  There was a guy out in the lake splashing frantically and disappearing under the water for 10 seconds.  I ran down to the water and swam out to him.  He grabbed on to my back and I helped him get to safety.  He coughed out a bit of water, said "thanks", and was on his way.  Then I sat back down with my family.  After I had a minute to gather my thoughts, I looked around the beach.  There were many people that were close enough to him to have heard him yell help and go out to him.  A lot of people sat there while he was drowning and just watched him.  From what Lydia saw, all of the people at the beach were perfectly willing to let the guy drown right in front of them.  I don't know where that kind of attitude comes from, but it is a very sad demonstration of the state of the world.  I sure hope that the day Lydia or Ash is in trouble and I am not there, someone will be there to help them.

						   Yesterday I recieved an invitation to  urlLink gmail  the new web-based email service from  urlLink google  and I must say it is great.  It has a very nice and simple interface, it loads quickly, and best of all it has a gigabyte of storage.  For any non-business email user, a gigabyte is enough space to store years of email.  It definately blows hotmail and yahoo mail out of the water.  I predict that either the competition makes drastic changes to improve it's offerings, or they start to lose a lot of customers.  Using the new gmail service is pretty exciting because of the options it has.  It reminds me of how excited I was to get my first email address from hotmail back in 1998.  Ya, I am a geek.

						    I found a really interesting site  urlLink here .  It is the website of The Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas.  Their job, in a nutshell, is to figure out when we are going to run out of oil and to raise awareness of the issue (or impending doom, depending on how you look at it).  According to them, the world will reach it's peak of oil production between 2008 and 2010.  Then the oil output will slowly fall until there is nothing left.  Estimates range from 50 years from now to hundreds of years from now before we actually run dry.  If oil starts to cost $200 per barrel because of the low supply, are the most powerful countries of the world going to pay that?  I would guess that they are going to "Shock and Awe" those prices down to a more reasonable level.  By that I mean they are going to carpet bomb the oil producing countries into submission and take control.  The big problem with finding an alternative to oil is funding.  Oil, today is worth mountains of money and the people in control of it are very rich and powerful.  These rich and powerful people are not going to support technology that makes them redundant.  I might even venture that some of the larger oil companies are powerful enough to stifle innovation to prevent viable alternatives from appearing.  One can argue that the car companies are now making hybrid vehicles that get previously unheard of gas mileage and they are doing their part.  When I see a car dealership, I see one or two hybrid cars and a hundred V8 gas guzzling SUVs.  The car companies are not soley responsible for this, they make what the consumer demands.  The  urlLink site  is definately worth a look if you are curious about the future.   Disclaimer:   I drive a giant boat of a car with a V8 that gets worse gas milage than should be legally allowed, but it is sure fun to drive.

						    One of the major issues in Canadian politics today is nobody really knows what is happening to our tax dollars.  Politicians at the Provincial and Federal level are all talking about "accountability".  "Government Accountability" is to politics today as "Synergistic Technologies" was to businesses during the .com boom.  Both of those phrases sound really good but actually mean nothing.  Government accountability to me means that they must answer for and defend any actions that they take.  When a government official is questioned about spending public money and the word "inquiry" comes up in the response, they are not being accountable.  When we accept that response, we are not holding them accountable.    Every dollar of public money that is spent must be justified at the time of spending, not when someone notices that money is disappearing.  If I want to know why the Governor General needed to hire a private jet to fly from Ottawa to Calgary for a presentation when an Air Canada flight for %50 of the price met her time requirements, I should be able to get that information immediately.  This is the beauty of the information age, instant access to data.  All government expenditures should be published and made accessible at the time of spending.  A website should be kept up-to-the-minute with all of this information.  This way every Canadian will know exactly where the money is going and why.  We deserve it, it is our money.

						    Hopefully the regular welfare bums are next   urlLink CBC reports  that Mr. Stephen Harper is planning on cutting corporate subsidies in return for cutting the taxes that corporations pay.  Harper has been working really hard lately to keep his name out there because it appears that the conservatives have a fair chance of winning the election.  "Harper described Prime Minister Paul Martin's own company, Canada Steamship Lines which received $160 million in loans and grants as one of the 'worst offenders.'"   I don't know if that is as powerful a statement to everyone else as it is to me.  That type of information should be disclosed publicly as soon as a grant is awarded.  Here is an idea: How about we keep corporate taxes the same, and cut the corporate grants and subsidies.  If a corporation can't generate money on it's own, then it will fail and another one will take it's place.  I have a simple breakdown for the Conservative economic ideology compared to the Liberal economic ideology: Liberals = If there is a problem, throw more money at it.  Out of money?  Raise taxes. Conservative = Find out the cause of the problem and try to solve that problem.  Not to say that tax increases aren't possible with these guys either, they just try to spend money more efficiently.  Now if Harper would just do something with that terrible hairdo/rug (can't tell for sure).  Update:  BCTV reported this piece with the headline "Harper promises tax cuts to corporations".  While both the BCTV headline and CBC's are %100 factual, it is a good reminder that even straight facts can be presented with a spin to make you lean in the direction that the media wants you to.  It is important to look past the spin and see the stories for the facts.  Once you have the facts, you can form your own educated opinion.

						    I am not going to discuss whether or not the war in Iraq was justified or not, the point I am trying to make is that the way the war has been fought will never succeed.  The US and its allies went in to Iraq thinking that their army would be welcomed with open arms as they were freeing the Iraqi people from the evil regime headed by Saddam Hussein.  It must have never crossed their minds that dropping thousands of bombs on their cities would have scared and angered the people of the country.  The US did easily defeat the official Iraqi army, but the so called "insurgents" (i.e. soldiers out of uniform) are impossible to fight with the current military tactics.  The main problem with the insurgents is that they look exactly like civilians, but for the US to have a media-friendly war they cannot kill innocent civilians.  The civilians have to declare themselves combatants before the US can fire on them, and the declaration is usually made with heavy explosives or gunfire.  This means that one Iraqi can take out 2 or 3 soldiers before they start fighting back in most cases.  From a simple numbers perspective that is a huge disadvantage, nevermind the psychological disadvantage that the US soldiers face.  To win an invasion, the invading army must take complete control of the country.  That involves winning regions of the country a few at a time, flying flags in the won areas and keeping a forceful presence in the regions that have been conquered.  The US does not do that.  They leave each city once they assume it is conquered.  The insurgents rebuild their equipment, find new recruits and start fighting again.  You never see the US flags flying because they are trying to demonstrate that they are liberators, not invaders (a complete fallacy).  Although the flags are merely symbolic they demonstrate to the people that the country is no longer under the old government and that they have lost.    There are two options that the US has to fix the mess they are in now:  They can mount a major offensive on the whole country costing many civilians thier lives and decisively conquer it, or they can pack up and go home.  Anything else that they try will remain a complete failure and will cost thousands of lives.  War is a always brutal and disgusting thing, that is the way it has to be.  A media-friendly war will always fail.

						    I was running around my back yard in bare feet and stepped on a nail from my old sundeck.  It was a pretty big and crooked nail and I was unable to pull it out myself.  Anybody who knows me will tell you that I will do whatever it takes to avoid going to the hospital.  It just isn't something I like to do.  But after twenty minutes staring at this nail in my foot trying to figure out how to remove it, I went.  The emergency room was packed.  I sat in the waiting room for two hours before I was called in.  To my surprise I was not being called in to see a doctor, but I was moved to another waiting room with a sign on the wall that read "Fast track area".  There was a nice old man in the room with me and we talked for a while, he had a pretty sore shoulder he told me.  After 20 minutes talking to the old man, he said "I don't think they want to help us.  I will just go home and hope it works itself out." and he left the hospital.  It was almost two hours before the nurse came to get the old man, and I told her that he was long gone.  I also mentioned that I had a giant nail in my foot that has been in there for 4 hours and I would like to have it removed.  She said that they were doing the best they could but there was only one doctor on staff.  One freakin' doctor?  There were 35 people waiting to see this doctor.  I finally got to see the doctor a total of four and a half hours after I entered the emergency room.  I received two needles: one for tetanus, and the other to freeze my foot for the nail removal.  I felt bad for some of the people waiting to see the doctor that were probably in worse shape than me, but at the same time I was happy to have a nail-free foot.  I have to say that the staff at the hospital were taking a beating from some of the patients in there because of the wait times, but they were doing their best to get through everyone quickly.  The doctor and nurse that helped me were friendly and we had a nice time all things considered.      Let's pretend to forget how terrible Ujjal Dosanjh was when he was in charge of BC, and hope like mad that he can do something to fix our health care system.  I fear that he is going to use the classic NDP strategy of throwing mountains of money at a problem walking away from it.  While extra money would have paid for another doctor in my case, the main problem is how the money is spent.

						    Paul Martin announced his  urlLink new cabinet  yesterday, and one of the appointees really stuck out to me. Ujjal Dosanjh, the former Premier of British Columbia is now the Health Minister. Maybe I am the only one that remembers, but this guy and the rest of his  urlLink old party  caused so many problems in BC, that we gave the  urlLink BC Liberals  a near dictatorship in Victoria. Near the end of Dosanjh's term as Premier, he sent millions of BC dollars to his home country of India to start himself some businesses.  Now this guy gets a promotion. He is in charge of Health Care, the most important program in Canada. Paul Martin seems to think that he can fill the cabinet with BC content and it will please us Westerners. It is a great example just how out of touch Ottowa is with Western Canada.

						    My  urlLink recent post  about the return of my lost wallet was published in both of the local papers in my town.  The papers used the titles "Returned Wallet Restores Faith" and "Lost Found and Many Thanks".  I have to admit that those titles were better than mine, but they get paid to write and I do it for free.  In a final toot-my-own-horn moment, I would like to say that neither of the papers edited a word of my post.

						    The  urlLink trial  for Todd Bertuzzi has been set to start on July 22nd.  Everybody knows that he punched Steve Moore in the head from behind.  I fail to see how charges were even considered, let alone laid in this case.  Professional athletes in all sports know that they are risking their bodies, and careers every time they play a game.  One of the reasons that they make so much money is to offset the risk they put on themselves for our entertainment.  Hockey is an especially physical sport and players do resort to fisticuffs on occasion.  Fighting in hockey is as old as hockey being played on ice.  The reason fighting is important in hockey is to protect players from little cowards taking liberties on other players.  The game is so fast, and the boards are quite hard.  When the game is played with no respect for the players, there are serious injuries.  Knowing that your face will be rearranged if you do something stupid is what keeps a little bit of sanity in a very crazy sport.  The issue of fighting and lack of respect is the first cause of Bertuzzi's punch.  A few weeks before the incident, Steve Moore lined up Marcus Naslund's head with his shoulder and laid a very strong hit.  There has been much discussion on the fairness of that hit, but I am not going to touch that right now.  The moment a player on the opposing team hits your captain in the head, it is your duty to make sure he pays for it.  Nobody on the ice did anything to Steve Moore even after Naslund was taken to the hospital.  After the game, came the second cause of Bertuzzi's punch: the media.  Every reporter in the dressing room, and every BC newspaper the next day was asking about revenge.  "Is Moore going to pay for that?", "Is it going to be like  urlLink SlapShot  next game?" and on and on.  That got all of the fans into a bloodthirsty mob waiting to see Moore pay.  The NHL had a chance to prevent the Bertuzzi incident by sending the league a message.  All they had to do was suspend Moore for 5 games for a headshot, and everyone would have been happy.  By not suspending Moore, the league effectively told the Canucks to sort it out themselves.  If the NHL does not want to see this kind of violence, they have to stop punishing the fighters and start punishing the cheap-shot artists.  Between the lack of instant revenge on Moore, media and fan pressure, and the NHL saying "sort it out yourself" there was the making of a very interesting evening the next time they played.  The Colorado Avalanche were dominating the Canucks during the game, who were obviously distracted by the thought of payback on Moore.  The only person that Steve Moore would face off with was the tiny Matt Cooke.  Moore stood up to Cooke quite well, but seeing as Cooke is far from a fighter and smaller than Moore, it was to be expected.  Near the end of the game, it was starting to get rough on the ice.  Bertuzzi grabbed on to Moore's jersey and challenged him, but Moore was trying to ignore Bert.  This is where Todd made his big mistake, he through a devastating punch to Moore's head from behind.  Moore had a concussion and a couple of cracked vertebrae in his neck.  Todd Bertuzzi is 245 pounds and he packs a mean punch.  Moore knew that, and that is why he wouldn't stand up to Todd.  All Todd had to do was grab Moore's arm and spin him around first to punch him straight in the face.  Had the punch been face-to-face, it would have to be ruled acceptable in hockey terms.  I feel for Todd's position because the intensity of the situation would cause anyone to stop thinking clearly.  I will point out that if Todd had punched Moore in the face instead of the side of the head, Moore would be eating through a straw for a year.  With that in mind, maybe Moore should be thankful that he was punched from behind.  You can guarantee that Moore will forever think twice before trying to knock a star player out for the season.  I fully support Todd Bertuzzi and look forward to his return to the Canucks.

						    Just when you are about to completely lose faith in all of humanity, someone does something to save it.  Yesterday afternoon my wallet disappeared.  Obviously it is a major setback to lose something so important.  Less than an hour after my wallet went missing, a lovely young couple showed up at my door with smiling faces and a wallet.  I tried to get their phone number and address so that I could reward them as a token of my gratitude, but they would have none of that.  They simply told me to return the next wallet I found to its rightful owner.  I obviously agreed to that deal.  They said to me "Happy Sunday!" and drove off.  The nameless couple could have dropped my wallet off in the nearest mailbox or turned it in to the gas station attendant where they found it, but they chose to drive across town and make sure it got to me safe and as soon as possible.  They are the kind of people that try to make this world a better place, and to thank them I ask all of my faithful readers to do a little something nice for someone next time you get the chance.  I know I will.

						    Since it is summertime, the police are out in full force trying to catch those evil criminals, the speeders.  If you are caught driving your car faster than the posted speed limit, prepare to pay between $196 and $450 for it.  In a construction zone those fines are doubled.  According to the last police officer I talked to, you will not get a ticket for going 10 km/h over the limit, but he would not answer if 11 km/h was the ticket-worthy speed threshold.    Speeding itself does not cause accidents.  Reckless driving and stupid drivers do cause accidents.  Do they set up "stupid driver traps"?  Of course not.  If you spend more than ten minutes on the road in a day, you will see at least one incident of a stupid driver causing a near-accident or worse.  It's the same with the drivers that think the right turn lane is actually for passing cars through intersections, that is a far more dangerous maneuver than having a heavy foot on a six-lane highway.  The safety of automobiles, handling ability, and braking power has increased exponentially in the last 20 years, yet the speed limits have not gone up at all.  On many stretches of road, there are concrete barriers in the center of the road, and on each side and the limit is merely 80 km/h.  Where is the danger?  It is impossible to run off the road or into incoming traffic.  There are no intersections to cross.  The only reason to have an artificially low speed limit is to make money.  When you see new highways made, you can see that they build locations for the police to hide and set up speed traps.  Those locations are safe for the police to jump in front of "speeding" cars and have them stop.  If a driver is on a straight stretch of highway and has the time to safely stop the vehicle because some maniac jumps out in the middle of the highway, then they are not actually speeding.    Yes, I am bitter.  I am $196 worth of bitter.

						    In a word: Yes.  Referendums are the best way for politicians to hear what their constituents want.    They are expensive, the upcoming  urlLink referendum in Vancouver  is going to cost upwards of a million dollars and it isn't about a terribly urgent subject.  The issue is whether or not to move the current  urlLink at large system  to a  urlLink wards based system .  Any time the public is given a chance to have a say it is a good thing.  Spending money to ask the people what they think is worthwhile.  Everyone should get educated on this issue and have their voice heard by voting.  I encourage politicians at all levels of government to ask us what we think more often.

						    Well it is all over now.   urlLink Here are the results.   I will admit that I hoped the public would have punished the Liberals for their blatant abuse of our trust and tax dollars a little more, but it was not to be.  At least now with a minority government they will be questioned multiple times by the other parties whenever they try to do something.  Historically minority governments have a tough time accomplishing anything and are quickly dissolved, but this government looks promising.  It looks like they will last around two years or so, barring any drastic events.  For those of you that think your vote doesn't count I would like to point this out to you:  In  urlLink my riding  there were 47615 votes cast and the difference between first and second place was 114 votes.  Since there was only a 65% or so voter turnout, the people sitting at home thinking their vote doesn't count could have changed the results.  If the second place NDP would have won in  urlLink my riding,  they would have had enough MPs to join forces with the Liberals and control parliament with a majority.  Instead, the Liberals and NDP together make up exactly half of parliament and must be careful of a no-confidence vote.  So there it is, each vote can make a difference and I encourage everyone to get informed and vote in all levels of government elections.

						     urlLink CBC reports  that now the drug activists in Vancouver want to have a "safe" place for crackheads to get high.  Of course, this initiative is sponsored with our tax dollars.  The safe injection sites we have now are a waste of money as it is, but at least it can be argued that clean needles are pretty useful to heroine addicts.  I am not the most sympathetic person when it comes to helping people that choose to destroy themselves, and this crack house idea is really making me angry.  The current safe injection site is costing us one million dollars per year.  That money would be much better spent in the school system to help children become useful members of society instead of useless junkies and criminals.  "It would seem logical." to assist crackheads getting high according to the Health Authority.  Logical?  What is logical about helping crackheads smoke crack?  If we want to help them smoke crack, we should teach them how to break into houses and cars more effectively so they can rob hard-working useful people of their possessions to feed their crack habit.  I have a really good solution for all of the crackheads and needle junkies.  But I think I will keep it to myself for now.  If we do buy the crackheads a place to smoke, I may suggest it.
