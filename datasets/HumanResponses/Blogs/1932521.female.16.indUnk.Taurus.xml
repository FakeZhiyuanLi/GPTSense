      wowwwza fer real i have just been happy lately. like theres nothing to bring a girl down, well a few, but like honestly, my life is amazing riot nio. for example, yesterday i worked with jim, and hes just really nice and i love that kid. then i could drive home cuz my parents were so thoughtful as to give me my liscence back. then me tess mart and clarr warched one of the worlds best movies : dickie roberts: former child star. and something as simple as playing a few games b4 bed just made the night complete. i went to bed happy and woke up in the night laughing b/c sarah started screaming things in her sleep waking us all up. then in the mooonin i ate pop tarts, which was a positive, but the best part was emma was doing all of her dances for us and hannah was attempting them too. it was hillarious. and then we hit shady izzoak. it just was one of the best spans of times EVER.  u know what i was thinking about tho, just to go deep for a sec. having a boyfriend or a girl friend is so WIERD. like think about it. you pour your heart aout to one person, and say all these things, and do little cute things for them like go to their games or buy them presents, or suprise them somewhere. but then like, when youre 'done' with them and move on to the next person, you do it all again, and its all the SAME. like, you end up saying that same nice things, and going to the same games, only for a differnt person. like why does it mean anything any more. or why do ppl not get offended when someone askes them out. i do. so the next time that a guy askes me out im going to start crying and ask them why they dont care about me. but seriously think about that. it makes you wonder the significance of your relationships.   gatta eat and then coach, wish my sistas team luck.  ~~monroe

      k well last night was one of the funnest nights in a while. we took care of business on jenny's tramp, and we watched a few quality movies such as hollow man, memento and small portion or rats. we had one mass CO-ED sleepover which is just a positive step in a whole new direction. but the guys were just to 'with it'when we played chuck or fuck, but they're new...i guess u could say. also avital sang a few songs which were amazing, on the flip-side, she woke up the entire house at 5 in da mooonin. but honestly it was fun. next step: sleeping in the shaggin. it will happen, im calling it.   oh and david wilkinson you owe me two dollars and do not deny it. u happen to make the same bet twice and, yes, you lost so PAY UP. oh and u spelled ur own name wrong in sarahs yearbook from way back in the day. ur spelled ur name wilkonson. (poor kid) ahem...  ok, i really dont know what to say, im so conflicting. a part of me really wants to just blow up and write this nasty blog about something that happened. because i felt like i was about to throw up for about..mm..a couple hours last night. like i try to tell myself that i dont care, and its not a big deal and to move on, and like ive been trying to psyche myself out for like the past few weeks but i guess im not doing a good enough job. but like it really ISNT that big of a deal and i dont even know why im wasting ppls time writing this. i think its not that big of a deal to me until im really there caought up in it, then it means the world to me. aaah. i hafta go  im helping coach my dads soccer team baby  ttyl

      well lets see. 2day i visited augsburg, played nintendo with quaile and buyas, i worked with yossi and jamie, hmm and hung out with the jew kids. it was a hot one. soo hot. want to touch..nvm. oh and CLAIRE BROKE HER PHONE. lets see. she made it about....45 minutes with that phone. i got it. lets all pitch in some money and buy her ONE of those clips (the one that attaches the mitten to your jacket sleeve) and clip one end to her phone and the other to her FACE. now that thats settled..  the shaggin last night was a GROOD...i mean great...and good... great and good... time, david did manage cover his face in wax. Typical david forgot that the candles would eventually overflow with wax, and he was lying on the floor under one of the corner-shelves and all the wax flowed off the shelf on to his face. it was a beautiful thing. oh and we did have a HARD CORE card fight, and yes i took every one with authority. especially clay. poor kid. but honestly the shaggy waggy looks emaculate, everyone should check it out, and david would like the company. it would give him something to do other then make out with his sister.   moving on  i have the thought of the blog. ok. lets say u have a friend or a lover or someone who talks about a past person. like a friend talking about an old friend or a lover talking about an old lover. and they talk so, like, lovingly about them. and like how they miss them so much or like they were devistated that they couldnt see each other cuz they moved, died, or broke up or something. ok. well do ever wonder if they are thinking like that about you? like so u arnt frinds with someone ne more, or like arnt dating someone ne more, do u think that they are having those same feelings about you? like are they upset cuz they cant be with u ne more? or was that one person they were talking about just amazingly special to them and u dont mean nething to them, and they havnt thought about you since. see that bothers me. i guess that whole paragraph was saying that i wish that i knew if ppl were thinking about me the way they thought about other ppl or like im thinking about them. like if i meant ne thing to them. cuz maybe i thought of them as a best friend, but they only thought of me as someone to hang out with when they were bored......  well its 1 in the morning and i should be hittin the sack. i am going to Bethel tmrw, im leaving at like 130, call me if u wanna hit that with me.   night  *alison

      hewlow  alright well big news about the shaggin almost being done, it does look hot, ill admit that.   umm survive it and drive it just finished about an hour ago, it it was STUPID. they gave both of them cars b/c neither of them were going to stop. see that just ruins the fun but w/e floats ur boat. they did go around about 1500 times, and really thats sick.   if ne one wants to come to colleges with me, hit me up cuz im getting lonley. im going to gustavus this morning, im going to one tmrw and 2 on friday. oh and COME AND VISIT ME WHEN IM WORKGING 2NITE AND TMRW 4-9.   ok so the feeling of the blog. this random feeling that was pissing me off is the 'sudden not caring' feeling. dadaadadaa. idk if ne one u have felt that, but i bet that u have. its like u think that someone really cares about you or something that ur doing, and then when ur done then they just kinda...stop caring...and u wonder if they really cared that much earlier or if they were just kinda doing it b/c they had to, like if u guys were dating. or if...uumm...uu..were..bbsitting someone..hmm. and that just sucks and makes u just feel not cool.   but its okay, ive found things in my life to make up for it, for example, claires car. i have NEVER been sad when im in claires car, she always has a happy mix, or good things happen in thurr. so moral of the 10 second story :if ur in a pissy mood hit up claires car.   alrrrizzite, gatta bounce beyatch  donde esta la biblioteca Pedro?  *~aya~*

      ok so this one is going to be dedicated to lying becuase i think that its a problem that has infested ppl lately and it is just not cool. im not saying that everyone lies xcept for me b/c i do it too. but i just want to say that a lot of the lying that is going on right now is really hurting ppl, for example a witnessed a lie that took place about 20 minutes ago and if it were me on the other end i probably would have cried. like ditching ppl isnt cool. ill just leave it at that. and i just want to give a should out to the ppl who build on other lies : someone is ALWAYS going to find out no matter what. anf it is only going to get worse. there is no way to live a lie for your ENTIRE life, b/c eventually its going to come up again and its only going to be 10x worse then. so just stop being stupid and just admit what u need to say, or be mature and talk about it. b/c if ur lying ur obviously trying to cover something up, which really should be talked about. were all mature ppl here so, like if were me, i would have so much more respect for you if u actually laid it all out for me, and i would realize that u are being the bigger person and in the end i would later thank you for that. so thats a HINT for all those ppl out there u are NOT TALKING TO BE BECAUSE ITS REALLY BOTHERING ME BECAUSE NOT TALKING TO SOMEONE ABOUT IT IS AS BAD AS LYING ABOUT IT. its not any different.   im sorry im just in a bad mood right now b/c so many ppl lied to me tonight, are lying to mo over a spread out amount of time, or are lying to eachtoher. aye aye aye  im not sure if u would understand, but go to jason mraz's website and it explains it very well, but seriously guys, THE BOYS GONE HOME  oh and we died claires hair today, its like a light strawberry blonde, it looks good. hit me up if u want ur hair died.   sorry guys al

      WELL i have a lot say considering i havent blogged since the day b4 the euro exam. but i decided to start over with a new blog and like vow to blog eaerry day. (every day).  tonight was a good night, we went over to alainers and we just partayyed it up like no other, it was a lot better then sitting in the wendys parking lot for the entire night, ill let u know that one from some past experience...OH and today was good. WE RE-DID THE FRIGGEN SHAGGIN!!. there are no words to describe what we did to it,but it just looks amazing, ill tell u that much. and its going to bet better once we put in the shelves and like put that gold shia all over it. this day would have been the best day ever except for the fact that davids mom SPAZZED on us because there was a few rolls of TP in his trees and he was to spoiled to clean it up, but im going to put that behind me and move on. but guys remember, "if u do it again you are no longer welcome in our house"  i was talking to byers about 1/2 hour ago about this, and he told me to blog so here it is...be excited. ok well im saying that ppl make it really hard to figure things out. like things never work out the way they should in the first place, and then once they get screwed up other ppl who dont really know what they are talking about make it so much harder to fix. rumors get started, ppl talk behind other ppls backs and ppl shoot other people. im sure ur all thinking about a specific situation that is going on right now, and thats not what im talking about, im just talking about problems in general. like if things just went bad and only the people who were involved knew about it then it would be so much easier to fix. but dont get me wrong, not all situations. like if ur getting stalked by a crazy old lady wearing over-all shorts that likes to go walking at 2 in the morning then PLEASE talk to the police or something. but like about all the 'drama'that happens. i think that we should all be like buddah and let it flow. nothing matters b/c whats happened has happened and u cant do ne thing to change that. also u cannot change how ppl are feeling b/c if ur changing ne thing, its not what they want..because ur CHANGING it. i hope u catch my flow. that rule of thumb also goes for the ppl that are involved with it b/c trust me, youre going to waste a lot of time for nothing b/c no matter how hard u try its still going to be what u dont want. yes i am the UNIVERAL BUBBLE BREAKER but i needed to slap u in the face and make sure u knew that b4 u wound up in that situation. IM JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU because i love you, i love you all. (except for david because he called me fat and then made his mom yell at me)  and if u dont listen to me and end up being screwed, hit up either me or mart for the top 10 bible verses to know that we got, they really help for like every situation. no joke.  ok well, im sorry if that first blog dissapointed you, but there are many more to come.   goodnight everyone, and as the amazing alex byers says "2morrow is a new day"  love that guy   ehhhwwley

      i have many things that i have been thinking about lately.&nbsp;  one being why its so easy to say that u dont care about someone when youre not around them, but then when ur with them u take it all back? or its so easy to say that u hate someone or that u just want to never see them again, but then when u see them u would kill for them to even talk to you? two being why is it that when u have no authority or right over a person you still feel like that are yours? like u know that u have no reason to, but u get insanely jealous when someone else is with them and hes not giving his attention to you? and u cant tell anyone because u have no reason to be feeling those feelings because hes not 'urs'. like why is it such a big deal when u see him later laughing with someone else, or when he casually puts his hand on someones hip, just in a friendship way.  why is it that in a realtionship one person can love someone with all their heart and soul, but the other person doesnt even mind that much when the relationship is finished? like it doesnt make sense. also do u think that it is possible that every one has someone out there in the world for them, but when u find them, maybe ur not the person for them? their person is still out there. like is it possible to find someone that ur meant to be&nbsp;with, and&nbsp;love so much that u could never love anyone greater, but then that person isnt meant to be with you?  &nbsp; i hate thinking about things like that. me and tess just kinda got on some of those topics, and my mind was still flowin, so i had to blog. if u have the simple answer to any of those q's....just email them to me.  &nbsp; me and rowdy are working together tonight, 4-cl, come and visit us &nbsp; striz

      well as u all have probably guessed by the title of this blog i am having a co-ed sleepover with the universally loved alex byers. he apparently 'doesnt want to sleep by himself in his house' so my dad was like 'well theres an aero mat in the basement' and that was that.  &nbsp; right now were just chillin, and its just cool...because its cool. lets see. today i went to the cross-town club with sarah, and then i rollebladed around the lake by myself cuz sarah wussed out. then me and tess went to byers' house b/c there were about 40 cars outside and his door was open. but really no one was inside and he had just stupidly left the door open. me and sarah like snuck all in thinking that they were like hiding from us too, but really... no one was home. then later me tess c-dub byers and clay chilled in the long lot. no joke. and then byers is sleeping over. its been a grand day. &nbsp; &nbsp; have u ever experienced i time when someone is talking to u about a time that u two had together but u dont remember it and u think that the other person dreamed it. like u know that it was a dream and its just really funny? well that just happened to me. ill just share that great experience with you all: mattgoneWild04: make sure to bring those sexy pajamas, the ones i love, those sexy sweats. HcKYcHiCA06: hah what. what sexy sweats? mattgoneWild04: u know damn well, remember when we went to ur house and then u went to change and then u changed into those sweats and u looked super fine assed in em HcKYcHiCA06: i think that was a dream mattgoneWild04:u changed into gray sweats wit sumin written on the butt, and a dark burgandy red shirt HcKYcHiCA06: i dont own pants liek that, im sorry man it was a dream mattgoneWild04: no way i hate u so much, ally, it was so sexy. u have to remember, and bring them to camp HcKYcHiCA06: im sorry&nbsp; and it just went on for a while. lol  &nbsp; well that about wraps it up, im going to the driving range tmrw. it will be a grand time. peace&nbsp; &nbsp; aballaby &nbsp; "u want to come to the pants party?"

I DIDNT FIND IT! so i went to bed thinking that my phone was ont he ground outside getting all full of water and morning dew, and then i had a few nightmares, and then claire called me saying that she took my phone home in her purse. it was a beautiful thing. thanks claire for making me one hour deprived of sleep. jk  i love this SAT class, its full of 12 hot junior guys  i want to announce to the world that i have overcome a large barrier in my life, as of yesterday. and it feels good. it took a lot of cold pricklies to make it happen, but i got 'er done.   wewell i hafta go play nintendo..peace  holla  "I DONT KNOW WHY WE ARE YELLING!!...LOUD NOISES!!" ~ the best movie ever   ****striz

      its been a while...member that song? no fer real its been like a week and a lot of shia has gone down. lets have a large and in charge replay: right b4 i left claire and byers were at my house playing board games and reading about how mary-kate is addicted to drugs until like 1215, and then i still had to finish packing. then about 10 minutes later i had to be at the ariport at 6 in the morning to catch a plane to Mass for a hockey camp.  day1: it was tight cuz we just kinda chilled at our coaches house and ate a lot of food and watched van wilder. great..yet sick movie. and we got our hotel room and got all settled and shtuff. day2: we were woken up at 615 for breakfast and like an orientation that me and brando were late to cuz we were buying little toy boys lacrosse sticks. they were a necessity. then we got our clothes that we had to wear ALWAYS and then we skated edges and stuff and split us ito groups. i guess by watching you skate on your ourside and inside edges they can tell how good you are at hockey..and i got shafted cuz i haddnt skated in 2 months. but it was fly. then after skating we had plyometrics--if u dont know what those are just think jumping...lots of jumping. after that i dont really remember exactly what we did but somewhere in there we skated 3 more times and had 3 more drylands b4 being shipped back to the hotel at 930.  day3: it was our first real day and it was the longest day of my life. i was amazingly sore from the day before and honestly couldnt walk. but regardess we had 4 killer hours of skating with a wicked long run in the woods by the arena in the rain. like it wouldnt have been that bad but then we ran by the steepest hill that u have ever seen and our coach made us slide down it. little did we know that we were going to sprit up that beyatch thousands of times until this 14 year-old like collapsed on the hill and then we dicided it was time for us to run all the way back. i pretty much died. after that it all blurred together. day4: 2nd real day, and at this point i was so sore that when i tried to get out of bed my legs gave out. it was a horrible experience. but it was worse trying to put my pants on b/c TO SAVE MY LIFE i could not pick up my leg to put them on. so i ended up sitting on the bed and using my ARMS to pick up my own leg. also the highlight of this day were the slide boards. if u dont know what they are they are like a sheet of plexi-glass that u slide across with little booties on. it seems fun but its not. i reached a point that i had never reached before. at a point my legs gave out at the end and honestly i could not get up. like i REALLY couldnt. im lying on this plastic sheet in a puddle of my own sweat trying to use my arms to lift myself up and at that same time about 130 coaches and councelors surround me and are screaming at me to get up and are like hitting the walls and floors and im just wiggin out. i thouhg i was dying. i think i was becase i dont remember ne more. xcept that we skated for the same 4 hours and had thesame drylands. oh we did have the stabillity balls for one dryland which i got a kick out of. that was a highlight.  day5: our last real day. it was just like the onthers xcept for that we had a scrimmage for our last our of skating. and and durring the day we had this like crazy kickboxing thing. the lady who ran it was the beastiest ladies i have ever seen. she was REALLY into the whole thing. and it was wicked tired after it, it was 2 strait hours of lots oj jumping and football running and punching air. it was funny cuz everytime we did just a normal jab we had to say the person we were imagining that we were punching. it was a good time. i bet u are all wondering who i was punching. lol. annnnywayy day6: this day all i can say is parachutes. and mine was HUGE. talk about pulling the groin muscles. ouch. still cant walk right. but that was about it.  oh and i met some really cool ppl there. ill just tell u the ones that reminded me of ppl here: -this girl names leah who was the spitten image of meg, ben carlsons older sister - i swear this girl could have been brandon b's sister - this coach who was an older adam galililiililii...hmm and the cool ppl were the one girl that was called corey that i thouht was a guy for a while and my roomate called gardner, but with a boston accent it was gaadnaa. ** and i heard the song coolo about 20 times along wiht freak-a-leak. it was tight as hell.   well this is a wicked long blog just about camp, i think that ill come back tmrw after church and blog fer real. night all  *~minnesota~* (that was my name at camp??, along with strick)

      i just got home a little bit ago, and im glad that i did. im just in a damn good mood right now. ill just give u the good day run thru right quick: *woke up at 1030  *byers picked me up at 11 15 and we went to the twins game. we did happen to miss the only scoring of the game, but it was okay because byers made up for it by buying a foot long beast of a hotdog. and he purchased my ticket. twas a grand ole time  *went to work and had the best time i have ever had there. me and yossi had some deep convos, and i dont think that i have ever laughed so hard. when we get fruit its put in this huge plastic bin-thing and put in the freezer for when we need it. so we needed it today and we had no idea how to get it out of being a giant frozzen rasberry ice cube. we sat there in the back with huge butcher knives just stabbing the thing and then using a plasic spoon put the shavings in another bin to use. meanwhile we listened to the jason mraz cd FOUR TIMES. eventually we were covered in melted chunks of soggy rasberries and we had spilled the giant icecube on the table. after that, im not sure what really happened. all i know ids that i had to clean it up  *then i went home, changed and drove to clarsky dub's house,...just in time to say bye to ppl and to take byers home. but really we didnt go home, but had our own partay and picked up te$$  *we went to baker square and then partayed in the long lot with a hard-core q&a session. sorry u missed out.   *then i went home.   * i blogged  sad everyone is leaving and i feel that im never going to see anyone again. i really want to have a giant calander of when everyone is leaving and coming back cuz right now im flappin in the breeze here. i havnt packed and i have to be at the air port at 6 in the moonin at sat. i have some work to do.   well i will bid you farwell, if i be just for the night, or for the next couple of weeks. aye aye aye.   come visit me i work tmwr 4-cl  night lovers *~Al~*

      honestly alex byers is the best person ever. like no matter what negative thing i say he always has something to turn it around. i could say that i hate the way the state of new york is shaped and he could tell me that maine is in the process of selling a chunk of land to NY and in the end it will look differnt. HcKYcHiCA06: but it pisses me off, like all the fricken love stuff BaSeBaLLa964: well a-weew-lo that is why u dont get involved like that BaSeBaLLa964: u get into really great friendships BaSeBaLLa964: and u just love life with ur friend  BaSeBaLLa964: and as far as tappin goes BaSeBaLLa964: i am always an option  i love this kid you dont even understand. and tmrw we are hittin a hot twins game, it will be a big day. and im working tmrw with yossi,  4-cl, EVERYONE come and visit me  no but reallyi had fun 2nite at avitals, we played the question game, which is fun like always, and just chilled. we did leave at about 1145 and i got hom eat like 1230, we just got hard-core lost. like not lost, just missed every possible exit and such.   over the last 2 days something happened that made me EXTREMELY happy, and something that just made me want to throw up again, out of like..anger?.. i dont even know. so if u think that u did the thing that made me happy please do it again for my sake, and if u think u did the thing that made me want to cry and enter into a feedle position, try and avoid it, or at least around me.   well, im off to bed, and i hate it. why do u always dream about the thing that u cant have, and is the last thing that u want to be thinking about. after a dream dont u wake up so happy that u finally got it, but then u realize that it was all a JOKE and u get to either go out and see the harsh truth in the real world, or go back to bed and have it happen all over again. yay. now im excited.   night world *striz*

      who ever said that dress-up was for little kids was stupid. cuz im proud to say that in this last year alone i have played dress-up at leaste...mmm..18 times. no seriously i think like 5. thats kinda embarrising, but i wear it proudly. i think the only person that should be embarressed is clay, cuz he just looked stupid, or more likea beastie girl as i stated earlier. oh and claire, u looked like u were on every drug possible. sorry.  i want to bring to everyones attention that in the last 3 weeks i have seen david...1ce. ok, i was gone for two of those weeks, but i have been home for like a week and i have seen david 1ce. oh i forgot, hes too busy with every girl in the sophomore class, my bad. david, i thought that we had something, like we had some sort of connection. we went rollerblading around the lake together, that meant so much to me. i thought we were .... friends. **sniff**  moving on  boob-tag was fun last night. but its one of those games that no one wants to play, cuz u can NEVER relax the whole night. ur just reaching acrosse the table for some popcorn or sitting down, minding your own bizznas when....WWHACK...riioot in the boob. but it does keep everyone on their toes. by the way, who is IT?  ok this goes out to someone in paticular, but im not going to say who. i just want u to know that u mean so much to a lot of ppl, more people then u think. u make ppl laugh, and feel really good about themselves, especially me. you mean a lot to me and if anything happened to u i would be devistated. and i know a lot of people that feel the same. what ur thinking about would not help anything, even tho is seems like its only logical thing to do in ur case. but its not. at all. i bet thats what she thought too, but it didnt help a thing and think about how it made u feel, and what it has brought u to considereing. it would just bring more people to to feel what you are feeling right now. it woudl make everything worse. so many people love you, please know that. please, at least think about what i said.  ~)me(~
