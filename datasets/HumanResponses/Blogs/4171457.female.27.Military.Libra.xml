        Hello !!!          My section and I went to Munich, GERMANY to sightsee yesterday and that was a lot of fun. The weather sucked. It was raining all day, but that didn't dampen our spirits. I took a lot of pictures and will post them just as soon as I can. Munich has a lot of beautiful buildings and lots of stores!     The Germans eat a lot of pork, don't believe in ice in their drinks or A/C, and don't     drink regular water (prefer carbonated/seltzer water).     I have to go pack, since I was told last nite at 10:39 PM that I'm leaving today ( Sunday ) for Kosovo. Its like 8:52 am and I gotta be ready by 10am. Well the next post I make will be in Kosovo. I am so excited =)          All of you are in my prayers!          Patty A.

       Well I will not be leaving until Monday August 16, 2004 =(   I am so ready to just go!!! If we had the opportunity to go out and sightsee that would be great, but unfortunately we are not so fortunate. I will email all of you with a list of goodies that you    could send me if you so choose 2. Little things like: twizzlers, pictures of ureselves, magazines, I have no source of entertainment. I don't mean too complain. It will be better once I start working!!!  Luv you all and thank you for your email & letters!!!  Patty
