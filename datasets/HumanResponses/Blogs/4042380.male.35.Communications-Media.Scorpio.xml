      Well, I'm back from The Pas/O.C.N. and the concert was fu#king great!  I left Winnipeg at 7:30am and arrived at Noon to find that I was not allowed to check into nmy room at the Kikiwak Inn yet, so I mosied my way to the arena where the concert was and helped out the roadies and sound guys for 2-hours, they really appreciated it!  Once I showered and changed I arrived to the arena for the promoter to fill me in on what to do or say when I am doing my cut-in's to the station!  A huge crowd of Nazareth fans arrived to the centre at around 5pm and they were great to have on-air..cheering and yelling!!  I had the honour of picking up the band in our "Bigfoot" community cruiser and the guys in the band were great to chat with..no freaking ego!!  When we arrived for the meet and greet with contest winners, chief and council of o.c.n. and the mayor of The Pas, everything went well accept for the fact that I almost lost the keys to the cruiser with the bands personal stuff inside!  SHOWTIME!!!!!  the arena was sweltering by the time "Heritage" (an amazing local band) and "Travelling Band" (CCR Tribute group) worked the crowd up and I arrived on stage to introduce Nazareth the fans were absolutely frantic!!   It was a moment I will never forget..  For an hour and a half I was in rock and roll heaven!  I used to listen to tapes of the band when I was a teen and my best buds used to sit on the banks of the Assiniboine River outside Winnipeg for "River Parties"!!  And here we are almost 20-years later, here is Nazareth playing all the great tunes live and I actually got to introduce one of my favourite bands!  As a true Canadian would say..  Fu#kin' Eh!!  Gotta go now, the studio calls!  Ps: I found a great new way of making money on the internet and it is really cool!  If you live in the Winnipeg, Manitoba area and want to know more give me a ring on this blog or e-amil me at  urlLink keni_c@canada.com    CHEERS!!!    woof.

      Hey all!  What's been going on in the last little bit?  Well, my son Eian visited from Thompson, MB for 2 and a half weeks and we really enjoyed having him there!!  We spent 2-0days at Misty Lake Lodge in Gimli and had a great time!  I drove Eian home and spent over 14-hours on the road and was really freakin tired when I got home..  than I had to work the next day!  I am now getting ready for the road again!  I was asked to host the Nazareth Concert this Friday, August 6th, at the Gordon Lathlin Arena on the O.C.N. (Opaskwayak Cree Nation).  I am quite excited about this!!  Nazareth was one of my favourite bands when I was growing up.  My best friends and I used to go hang around the Assiniboine River, drink a few wobbly-pops and listed to Nazareth on the boom box..  You had to be there man!!  RIVER PARTIES!!  If you ever lived in the west end of Winnipeg around 1984-88, you know what I mean..That was my 60's!!  The last concert I hosted was The Watchmen. May-1998 in Thompson..A crazy concert!  People tell me that I look like the lead singer of the band and when I first went on stage the kids went nuts thinking I was him.. as a result the singer (Danny Grieves) was kind of snobbish to me.  I complimented him for one of his shows that was a highlight to me, he just swished around his wine glass and said "..that was nothing.." and walked away..What the fuck was that?  Anyways, tha band unfortunately broke up and I still wish Danny the best..He still is a kick ass singer..with a bit of an ego.  Anywho, I got to get back into the studio, I'll post y'all on how the Nazareth concert went.  If any of you are from the OCN or Winnipeg, Drop by and say hi eh?  I'm the spectacled bald bastard in black. I'll also be at the Westbrook Inn, Saturday doing the "Western Hour" at 3pm..  This is Sleddog signing off for now.. Woof!
