      A pivotal exchange at the June 10, 2004 press conference:  Q: Mr. President, I wanted to return to the question of torture. What we've learned from these memos this week is that the Department of Justice lawyers and the Pentagon lawyers have essentially worked out a way that U.S. officials can torture detainees without running afoul of the law.  So when you say that you want the U.S. to adhere to international and U.S. laws, that's not very comforting. This is a moral question: Is torture ever justified?  BUSH: Look, I'm going to say it one more time. Maybe I can be more clear. The instructions went out to our people to adhere to law. That ought to comfort you.  We're a nation of law. We adhere to laws. We have laws on the books. You might look at these laws. And that might provide comfort for you. And those were the instructions from me to the government.  So the question was: is torture ever justified?  Seems like a "yes" or "no" question to me.  But the answer was: Bush gave instructions to adhere to law.  That dodge, coupled with the growing stack of legal opinions on the subject, pretty much spells "YES" in all caps.  So who does Bush think he's fooling here?  Does he really think that Americans are that stupid?  The sad truth is: yes he does.  Sadder yet, looking at the polls that still show over 40% of Americans think he's doing a good job, he's not completely wrong on that point.

      So let's get one thing straight: when the photos, videos, and stories of prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan hit the news, the Bush administration says it's the work of "a few bad apples."  No connection whatsoever to the folks in charge.  No way, no how.  By the same reasoning, when the military does something well, such as capture Saddam Hussein (after the kurds have told us where he was), do we hear that it's the work of "a few good apples?"  Hell, no.  Bush and company are only too willing to take credit for the good news, but won't touch the bad news with a ten foot pole.  How's that for returning accountability to the White House?

      Sometimes it's the little things that people say in unguarded moments that provide a glimpse at their innermost feelings.  Way, way, way back in the early days of the Bush administration, a reporter asked Dubya how he thought things were going between him and Congress, to which he replied "It would be a heck of a lot easier if this were a dictatorship... as long as I'm the dictator."  When I first heard those words, it sent a chill down my spine.  Although he chuckled after saying this, it's clear that he wasn't joking around.  This administration has shown nothing but contempt for the system of checks and balances inherent in the three branches of the Federal Government.  John Ashcroft's disgraceful performance at a recent Senate hearing pretty much says it all: "screw you fellas, we'll do what we want."  I guess the next best thing if you can't be a dictator is to act like one.

      You've got to see "The Official Re-election Site for President George W. Bush" these days.  While John Kerry puts his campaign on hold out of respect, the Bush campaign seeks to profit from Reagan's timely demise.  Just when you think they can't get any more shallow, they manage to drain a little more water out of the pool.  As if that weren't enough, reports say Bush managed to diss Reagan during an interview with Tom Brokaw on Sunday.  When asked if he considered himself a "Reagan Republican," Bush responded that he was a "George W. Republican."  Dubya managed to pull off an amazing feat: pissing on another man's grave before he was even in the ground.  The real irony is, a year or two from now, I'm guessing you won't be able to find anyone who would have the nerve to call himself a "George W. Republican."

      Way back when in the early days of the Bush administration, "transparency" was quite a buzzword.  They spoke of how other governments should be "transparent," allowing the world to see what they were up to.  Talk about "do as I say, not as I do."  It has been well-documented that the Bush administration is a veritable black hole of information.  Read "Worse than Watergate" by John Dean for an excellent summation of the use of secrecy by the Bushies.  Yesterday, Attorney General Ashcroft repeatedly refused to release a potentially damaging memo regarding interrogation techniques to Congress.  Instead, he flatly refuted Senators' statements, in essence saying "trust us."  For folks with nothing to hide, these guys sure hide a lot.  But the really sad part is that there will are some Americans out there that are okay with that.

      Next to the Sopranos, nobody circles the wagons to protect the family quite like the Bush administration.  For some time now I've been thinking that this White House runs like the Mafia; you cross them, you get whacked.  Valeria Plame, meet Adrianna.  Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, with the guy running the whole operation who isn't all that stable upstairs. I wonder if Dr. Melfi can find an hour or two to listen to Dubya?  Ah, fuggedaboudit...

      This morning there was a brief newspaper article noting that the Kerry campaign is taking the week off out of respect for the passing of President Reagan.  This move includes re-scheduling two big fund-raising events.  Let's take a trip to the bizarro world and try to imagine what the Bush campaign would do if the roles were reversed.  For example, if it was Jimmy Carter lying in state, does anyone think that Bush would take more than his usual nap time off from chasing a buck?  Me niether.    The article also mentioned that Kerry gave the commencement speech at his daughter's graduation, and refrained from talking politics.  Contrast that with the Bush campaign's recent commencement speeches, which I believe contained political messages.  What John Kerry may lack in charisma, he more than makes up for in class.

      So the President's visit with the Pope didn't exactly go as planned.  In one photo out there, Dubya looks like a little kid sitting in a booster seat at a Denny's restaurant.  The chair looks huge and his feet don't touch the ground.  I've got "Meet the Press" going in the background, and they were running some of Ronald Reagan's speeches.  Whether you liked him or not, at least Ronald Reagan was a statesman.  Just try to imagine George Bush saying something like "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  Bet you can't do it without laughing.  Dubya is just a total lightweight, people all over the world know it, and our nation has become a laughing stock because of it.

      I for one am really tired of hearing the pundits talking about John Kerry's lack of charisma, as if it really mattered.  We've had three and a half years of so-called charisma, and what has it gotten us as a nation?  Stupid remarks like "We'll get Osama dead or alive," and "Bring 'em on" may sound tough, but they are hardly Presidential.  Giving Cabinet members and reporters their own nicknames may seem folksy, but let's think this through, shall we?  We've given the life of the party, frat boy, cheerleader, C-student a crack at running the country, and he's run it right into the ground.  What say we elect someone intelligent, thoughtful, and articulate, just for a change?  Does it really matter if he's charismatic?  I'd rather have a total bore in the Oval Office if he could manage to balance the budget, provide affordable health care for all Americans, and regain our nation's good name throughout the rest of the world.  We're talking about the job of President of the United States, not late-night talk show host.  Sheesh!

      I have to admit that during Reagan's Presidency, I wasn't all that politically savvy.  For most of that period, college and grad school took up most of my time, and I didn't spend much time thinking about the implications of Reagan's policies.  Not really sure how I feel about Reagan's demise, but I know one person who's probably dancing around his Paris hotel room right now, and that's George W. Bush.  The administation has been looking for something, ANYTHING to distract people from the seemingly endless parade of screw-ups coming out of the White House.  What better to take the heat off than the death of the most beloved Republican president of all time?    So let the spinning begin.  The first set of presidential remarks included these doozies: "Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom."  My first thought was that the current President possesses almost none of these qualities, with the exception of conviction, that is.  George Bush is nothing if not a man of conviction.  And even more impressive, the fact that he has been ABSOLUTELY WRONG about almost everything doesn't shake his conviction for a second.  Looking at the recent poll numbers, it seems that with any luck, a year from now he'll be facing a different kind of conviction.

      While on a hike today, I was thinking about the outing of Valerie Plame some more.  I read Joseph Wilson's book a few weeks ago, and found it an interesting retrospective on his distinguished career in public service.  It's all too ironic that Wilson was in Baghdad when Iraq invaded Kuwait.  His actions on behalf of our country in the days and months before the first Gulf war earned him the gratitude and praise of President George H.W. Bush.  That Junior and his thugs would do a hatchet job on this man and his wife only shows how pathetic they really are.  But on to the subject line of this post.  How is it that Bob Novak is still employed as a "journalist?"  How can CNN keep this guy on the payroll and maintain any credibility whatsoever?  Shouldn't he be issued a subpoena to testify on this matter, and if he refuses, be held in contempt of court?  Faced with the prospect of an unpaid vacation at the Graybar Hotel, I wonder how long his "principles" will hold up.  I'm guessing about 5 seconds, and that's being generous.  As the investigation on this matter heats up, we can only hope that when the dust settles, Novak will get what he has coming to him.

      Hi, and welcome to the Frisbee Dog!  Let me start by saying that I know absolutely nothing about blogging.  The namesake of this blog, my 7-year old Australian Shepherd, probably knows more about blogs than I do.  What I do know is that between the two of us, we've got a lot of things kicking around in our heads, and we were looking for a forum to express those thoughts.  In today's surreal world, we get a daily dose of outrage, insult, goofiness, stupidity, you name it, from the Bush administration, and his right-wing hatchet men (and women).  Let this blog be a place to connect the dots and vent from time to time.  Hope you enjoy it.  It's a toss-up as to who is the biggest jerk in the long parade of right-wing hacks in the media.  Rush Limbaugh has been the king for so long, but there are some real up-and-comers out there.  From what I've seen, I'd have to say that Sean Hannity is probably the hardest-working hack these days.  Like a little flap of skin hanging from the room of your mouth after you've eaten a really hot slice of pizza that you can't quit flicking with your tongue even though it hurts, I tune in to "Hannity and Colmes" from time to time.  I must say that it's been refreshing lately that Colmes has managed to grow at least one testicle, but it's still slanted hard right, don't kid yourself.  The thing I hate the most about Sean Hannity (and there are so many things to hate) is the way he sits there with his head tilted to the side while his guests are speaking.  For a guy that is so totally full of crap, he sits there with a smirk on his face and his cinder block of a head tilted to one side like a dog listening to an antique record player.  And that just bugs me.
