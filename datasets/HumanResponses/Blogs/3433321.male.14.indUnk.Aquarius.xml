      My brother let me install his Grand Theft Auto Vice City on my computer, and I immediately went at it. Taking cool cars, finding some guns, shooting stuff, it was awesome. I got through some missions pretty fast, too. If you like shooting games and role playing games, you'll like this one, it's great. I'm always broke on it though, because I die and get busted and use the grage that fixes up your car often.

      I have a game called America's Army, which I play on GameSpy. I really suck at it, so it get sannoying playing it after a while because when you die you have watch everyone else until they finish. I don't even know most the buttons and I can't get advanced marksmanship. Maybe someday I'll be better at it.

      Me and Cody pulled an all nighter with Halo last night after the party, it was great. I think the best part was when we did warthog races with rockets only. There was many warthogs blowing up. We also did a few capture the flags, and slayers. The best capture the flag was when it was on snipers only with no shield. Since there was no shield it was instant death, and it was really freaking hard to get the flag even though it was only 2v2. We also had a cooler full of sodas and two bags of chips, it was quite sweet. I'm not going to bore you with more Halo, so I'm stopping here.

      My friend, Jory, held a party yesterday and I got to go. It was lots of fun, we had 7 people all togethor: four guys, three girls. We did a lot of swimming, talking, hanging out. There's not much more to say about it, but it was fun. Afterwards I asked my friend Cody if he wanted to spend the night at my house, and he could.

      I played some more Halo online with a different friend, Cody, today. It was freaking sweet, I don't remember how many games we played but it was a lot. We mostly got owned but it was fun. Like on Battle Creek, I had a rocket launcher, and I was on the cliff right above Cody's little hiding cave. And some guy practically came up to Cody's face, when I blew him up right infront of Cody, and he was like "Woah where'd he go?" That happened a second time not too long after the first one. On that same game, we made a human tower so I could jump onto a dragon tooth ontop of one of the bases. When I got up there I saw a sniper behind this tree and so I started jumping in shooting, it was working for a while because he kept missing, but he finally killed me. Another funny time during our games, was on Hang Em' High. We were on one of the towers with snipers only settings, when I saw a guy come around the tower and was looking at me, so I threw a grenade and ran. Unfortunately, Cody ran right infront of my grenade, so it bounced off his back and exploded. As he was flying toward our enemy he got a headshot on him and landed on his body safely. After he landed another guy tried to kill him and right as Cody tried to punch him, I sniped him right out of Cody's face. There was much more greatness and fun but those were the ones I thought I'd share.

      My mom won't let me stay home on the last day of school now, it sucks. We arn't doing anything tomorrow and it's going to be super boring. Last week my mom said i could probably stay home Tuesday, and I thought that was cool. But yesterday I found out the skating field trip was today, so I asked to go today and stay home tomorrow and she said no. That is such a rip. =/

      I played some Xbox Halo online with my friend not too long ago, it was sweet. We did a few games of slayer and one capture the flag. I think the capture the flag part was the best because I got to blow up some warthogs, and I like doing that. ^^ It was pretty funny at one point, one of our enemies had our flag and was inches away from his base's backdoor when I sniped him. Now, me and my friend(Jacob) were pretty far away from the flag so I had him for it and I sniped out three other guys. It was hilarious when one guy jumped off his base to try and get our flag when I got a head shot on him, so he just fell like a rock and crumpled on the ground. We got owned on our first slayer game, which was in Chill Out, a level I HATE. Our two other slayer games were on Hang Em' High, and we did pretty good there. The first one we won by one point, it was 50-49. Not much to describe the Hang Em' High slayer games except...Pistols...Lots and lots of pistols.

      Everytime I play Random Team on WarCraft III I get the hardcore noob allies and extra pro opponents. It is getting really annoying and hard to win any games at all now. I am looking for someone good that might want to Arrange Team with me or try to pair in Random Team. The new AMM system is messed up and it's hard to win most the time, I hope Blizzard changes it soon with another patch. Doing this post, for some strange reason, has reminded me of World Of WarCraft, another upcoming game. This game is an MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game), and looks very good, and is going to be great fun. Anyone that likes RPGs might consider getting this sometime after it comes out.

      I have just gotten back from another boring day of school, thank goodness it is almost over... Only two more days to go! Tomorrow we get to go on a field trip to a skating rink, and Wednesday I'm hoping my parents will let me stay home because we arn't really going to be doing anything on the last day. I bet a lot of you have to wait until June, for those people, sucks for you. =P

      I can't stop thinking about some games that will be coming out soon. One such game as I'm sure many people are impatiently waiting for is Halo 2. Halo 2 is going to be the greatest game ever since Half-Life. Check out this cool gameply video: http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xboxtv/default.htm?t=3856&v=84513&bw=hi&ltn= sorry for it being a long URL, but for those fans out there, it's worth it. Another good game coming out soon is The Sims 2. This game is going to be great! There's family trees, new landscaping tools, ages, etc. This game will also be a big hit along with Halo 2. Many of my friends at school and on The Sims Online are telling me they want it badly. If you're into The Sims check out www.thesims2.com I just can't wait for those two games >

      I was playing Texas Hold Em' on Gamespy today, and I lost quite a bit of money. I don't seem to have any luck with that game anymore. But I still have three-hundred-seventy million dollars on it, lol. If you wanna play Halo or Poker or something on Gamespy, my SN is currently [FiNz]Kigami. It has [FiNz] in it because that's the clan I'm in on WarCraft III.

      Ok, this is my first Blog and I am hoping it will be something fun to do. My posts will probably be mostly about games, mostly WarCraft III. So, if you like games you might find something interesting here after I get it started. My SN on Warcraft III is Hayabsua- and my SN on The Sims Online is Muridan in the city, Dan's Grove and many more SN's on many different games that will eventually be posted. Have a great day!

      4th of July is comng up soon, and I can't wait, I love fireworks. Me, my sister, my brother, and my mom went to buy fireworks a few days ago, and we used most of them. I got a few rockets, red hot dynamite, and a rocket/fountain. I used all of them, actually, I think the only thing we DIDN'T use was one of those rolling trucks that shoot flames and fireworks. It was pretty scary when my sister lit this triangle which she THOUGHT was just a fountain. We didn't have anything to light our fireworks on except a stump a fair distance from our back porch, and she lit this triangle and ran for it. We're all on the porch watching the triangle spin and shoot sparks, etc., when it falls of the stump. We thought it had finished, but just then it launched straight at us and everyone started running, it missed my sister by inches, she kept saying "I almost died." Well, I got some more fireworks today, and I can't wait until tonight and our 4th of July party. I looooove fireworks, everyone have a fun and safe 4th of July!

      I got back from my 5 day trip, it was awesome. I made 4 more friends that are from a different school on the way. We had so much fast food on the way to SeaWorld and on the way back to Oklahoma, McDonalds, Wendy's, Subway, etc. Anyway, first we went to Seaworld and we did tours in restricted areas and went to shows and rode rollercoasters. I didn't think Seaworld was going to have good rollercoasters, but they did, 2 infact. I rode both of them so many times, one of them was the Steel Eel, which obviously was a steel rollercoaster, it had huge drops and an awesome twist about halfway. The second rollercoaster was called The Great White, which was an inverted rollercoaster (the ones where your feet are hanging and the rail is ontop), I thought it was the best of the 2, it had 2 loops and a few twists, sitting in the front was the best. I also saw a few shows, like Viva, which was a Belluga whale show, the Shamu Show, a waterski show, and a Walrus/Sea Lion/Otter show. I thought Shamu and Viva were the best, the Shamu show has 3 killer whales that do aweet tricks, like flips, splashing the crowd, etc. Viva was pretty good too, it had dolphins, acrobats, and Belluga whales, the dolphins could jump really high, 20 feet max I believe, and the Belluga whales didn't do much and I don't know why, the acrobats had most the show for some reason, but they were still good. The acrobats did tricks with the animals, bungie ropes, swings, etc. The waterski show was pretty good, but not all that much, same with the sea lion/walrus/otter show, that one was more for littler kids, but it was still pretty good. I kind of got out of order, so I'm going to correct it, the first day we did touring through the park and restricted areas and then slept infront of the shark tank. Sleeping there was awesome, I fell asleep pretty quick after watching the sharks swim for a bit. But at about 4:30 A.M. the speakers did some loud static, which woke up about half our group. When I woke up to that it was storming, and I could tell because there are windows above the shark tank, so whenever there was lightning it lit up the entire tank, and there was also a leak somewhere which kept me up for a bit with its drip drip drip.After Seaworld we went to Corpus Christi and hung out at the beach for about 2 hours, there was jellyfish so most people swimming got stung. When we left the beach, we went to the U.S.S Lexington (Lady Lex), and our captain gave us a scavenger hunt to do, which basically told us to go around the ship and find things and write them down. My group were such sissies, they got scared at the slightest noise, if you didn't know Lady Lex IS haunted. Anyway, we went to the most haunted hallway in the ship, which is the only hallway that makes a complete circle, and that hallway was known as Broadway. Me and my group went through there looking for answers for the hunt, when some in the kitchen kept making a banging noise, and it got louder and louder, when my group finally ran away leaving me and this one other guy behind to do the hunt ourselves. After the scavenger hunt, we did ghost stories in the anchor room, it made me jump quite a few times, because while the captain was telling us the stories there were random LOUD bangs, first at the left side then louder at the right, and the loudest from above, my heart was pounding. After all that we got time to relax in the gameroom, when we were told all the males were having a meeting there, it wasn't good news. One of the teachers told us that our bedroom had been ransacked. When we went to our room, the first thing I saw was the mirror which had a bar of soap below it and written on the mirror, it said "Get off my bunk or else" in neat hand writing. After looking around everyone's mattresses were on the floor except for one guy's which was the same person who owned the bar of soap. Our bags were all strung out on the floor and we found the sleeping bags all in one spot and the pillows in a different spot. I wasn't scared until then. I was sleeping below a friend of mine known as Evan, we were the only ones that could see down the hall, and the first unexpected thing we saw was a rolling chair fly inbetween 2 bunks. Later on, I looked away from the chair and like 10 seconds later I looked back and it was gone, kapoofed. At about midnight I saw a sailor in baby blue uniform walk to the emergency exit, nobody on the ship wears that kind of uniform. I asked Evan if he saw him and he said he did, so he went to check it out. Later on I saw the sailor go by again, and Evan came back and said he heard the door opening so he hid behind something and was close to the sailor, he couldn't get a good look at him thought because of the shadows. Everyone stayed up for like 2 more hours and finally fell asleep. The next day we got to look around the ship and buy things at the gift shop, just whatever. A person from the other school that became my friend came to me and told me he just had an unpleasant locker experience. He told me that he was hiding to scare some girls and after about 2 minutes all the lockers opened at once and started randomly closing. Then we went to a research vessel and looked at plankton and fish, and other water creature stuff, it was boring to me, I fell asleep half the time. It was fun after that because we went to this beach with no jellyfish, but there were crabs. There were humongous waves, that will twist you around if you get caught in its current, I borrowed a boogie board and only got a few successful waves. When we got to a Motel 6, I took a nice looooong shower to brush off all the dang saltwater. The next day we left to go home to Oklahoma. That was pretty much all the exciting parts of my trip, a lot more happened, but I didn't bother to put it in. The trip was awesome.

      I get to go on a five day trip to Corpus Christi and San Antonio for Sea World, so I won't be posting until I get back. It's going to be great fun, three of my friends are going too, so atleast I know someone there. See you all until then.

      Well, my cool photo which I named Kigami isn't working for some reason, whenever I try to put it back in, it says that it isn't a specified file or something like that and it IS A JPEG! Since that icon doesn't work I guess I'll stick with this cat for a while. Cats rule.

      I like cats, and I thougt I'd write about them in this post. I have grown up with cats all my life, most the time four of them. I currently have four, two male, two female: Blaze, Spaz, Blossom, and Angel. My friend Rebecca once told me, "I believe cats are the protectors of your soul and dogs are the protectors of your physical being." That very well could be true, and I don't doubt it. Cats do like to hang around people, maybe to get some attention? Or maybe to protect their souls? Or maybe both? Who knows, but I love cats. I like dogs too, and none more than the dog I have now. He is a German Shepard named Radar. He is a very well disciplined dog, he most likely won't bite you, I'm not even sure if he's a good guard dog, he might lick a criminal to death, but I havn't seen him bite in such a long time. Now, horses on the other hand, I think are a waste of time and money. Not to be mean or anything, I just don't think we need horses, unless we are going to use them for travel, which we don't. We have two horses that just kind of walk around eating anything and everything, getting fat. We REALLY don't need them. Hope this doesn't get any horse lovers after me.

      I really really really really really really *breath* REALLY want Halo 2, The Sims 2, and World of Warcraft to come out! Desperately! Like I said in my last post, I'm bored. Those three games I listed are going to be the greatest games of the year, and are going to be great fun for years to come. I want Halo 2 the most though. Why you ask? Why else? It's HALO 2! Better guns, better graphics, better AI, better everything! And the battle are on Earth now. World of Warcraft is next on my most wanted. I'm not much into MMORPG's, but WoW looks like it's going to be awesome, the biggest reason it looks fun to me is because it's based on the Warcraft World, hence the name, World of Warcraft. The Sims 2 is next on Hayabusa's top 3 wanted games. The original Sims got pretty boring after so many expansions kind of ruined the purpose of the game. But The Sims 2 is going to be much better, one bad thing though, there's expected to be eight expansion packs for it. But it's still going to be a great game, there's new ways to kill your sims (I don''t know any yet), you can get closer to your sims than ever, more realizism, etc. If you like games AT ALL, get at least one of those sometime soon after they are released. You know you want to...

      Jeez, I'm so bored lately, and it's SUMMER! Something is going wrong here. I sleep in, yet I'm still sleepy most the time, I have nothing to do, I think I might've overkilled my games. So, I'm left with a stick. Now that's boring too. Hmmm.... How about this string??? Yah! Way cool!

      If you didn't know, RvB stand for Red Vs Blue, which has become a popular web series. I've been watching their videos for a long time, and they are still funny. If anyone reading this hasn't been to redvsblue.com go there now. RvB makes funny videos using Halo on Blood Gulch. They have become so popular they were invited to the Bungie Fest and Dreamcon. Go watch their videos, they're great.

      For those of you who actually look at my blog, you'll notice I changed my icon, which is currently a Barbarian from Diablo II. I changed it into that because I have been playing Diablo II with my friend lately and I have a 1337 Barbarian. My friend has also recently made a Blog, called Room for Rent, go check it out if you want to feel meek and depressed. His name is okiejory (not real name), and is going to become a member of my Blog, he'll post once in a while.

      After playing Runescape for a few days, it got boring to me. I like to smith on games like Runescape but on the game, you have to go to the mine, get your ore, go all the way to Lumbridge to smelt the ore, then go ALL the way to Varrock to forge it, and that's a lot of walking/running. I don't want to have to go so far just to smith, Dransik was much better, too bad they started charging. =/

      I recently reinstalled my Diablo II game, and played it with my friend. We only got to Act II but it was fun. That's the thing about Diablo II, you play it for a while and it gets boring, but if you don't play it for a while, maybe like a month or so, and then play it again, it's fun again. The main reason I reinstalled it this time was because I found out about something called Runewords. Runewords are certain runes put in a certain order on certain items, that give sweet bonuses. I've only done one so far, which is the Runeword, 'Steel' by putting the runes Tir and El in a two socket sword.

      I just found out about a game on the internet called Runescape. It is pretty cool but has bad graphics, it actually reminds me of Dransik. Except Dransik sucks now since they started charging you to play and changed the name. But on Runescape, you don't even have to download it or anything it's all on the internet. You can walk around and do whatever you want, like make a fire, cook some chicken on the fire, kill stuff, etc. If you like Open RPG's then you'll like this, go ahead and try it out.

      Yay! I finally got a cell phone!!! I've been needing one for a while, but my parents just didn't want to buy me one. After some begging and being stuck at school with no way to call my parents, they finally got me one, well actually, I got my step dad's phone and he got the new one. He got the cool flip phone that has color, and it even has mobile chess! I love chess, and that makes me want his phone even more. But... I am thankful to even get a cell phone, just thought I'd tell anyone who actually reads my blogs.

      Haven't been writing many posts lately because I've have been busy and also because I have forgotten. Lots of cool stuff happened on Halo, I got a new game called Red Dead Revolver. It's a western type game where you shoot and kill lots of people, etc., it's pretty cool game but only good on single player campaign, the multiplayer sucks. What else happened...Ummm... Oh ya, I hadn't played WarCraft II in a while so I lost my CD and recently bought a new one. That game is classic, after all these years it's still lots of fun. Well that's all I can think of that has happened recently, that won't bore you too much.

      I recently got a new Xbox game called Ninja Gaiden, it is about a ninja named Ryu Hayabusa. It's a pretty cool game, it's hard and confusing at times too. Anyone who likes to slice and dice their enemies, this is a pretty awesome game for you. There's not much else I can say about it, but it does have really good graphics. If you have the money for a 50$ game, and like one player games, I'd say get this.
