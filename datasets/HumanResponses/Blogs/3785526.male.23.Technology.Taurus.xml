      Busy Day.&nbsp;Afternoon Time.&nbsp;Entrance of the Chinmaya Mission Hospital on the CMH Road. A man parks his bike. Receding hairline. Thick moustache. On the bike is his little daughter. Probably two... maximum three. Not cute but certainly precocious. An I-know-everything look. Kind of amusing to watch that on the kid. No slippers. Flowery frock. He puts the centrestand. Tells the kid to stay where she is till he comes back. Starts to move. A shrill cry. She wouldn't let him leave her. Clutches his shirt tightly. He tries to explain that it's only for short while. His fingers nimbly relieving her grasp on the shirt as he talks. She&nbsp;takes her hand off. But only for a little while. The cry is louder this time.&nbsp;He looks&nbsp;around at the blank faces staring at both of them. Gives her a pen asks her to play with it till he comes back. Doesn't satisfy her.&nbsp; He then offers a compromise. He'll just look from the other end of the road. Crosses the road keeping his sight on her. A mischievious smile in his face.&nbsp;His favor is returned. A mischievious smile spreads across her face. Probably I think she took the clue. He looks and tells her to stay where she is and he'll be returning in a jiffy. Two steps. Turns Back. Repeats the same. I think he wanted to drill the fact that she is not to move from her place. I think he was wasting his time. There was no way she could have climb down from the bike. That too the bike parked in an ascent. He walks in. She looks for a moment. And suddenly slides down the bike with an elegance. My eyebrows raise. Smooth as silk. Thats how it was. Looks at the road. Takes a step. Very cautious. As though not to make noise. Two..three..Same caution mixed with fear,excitement and naughtiness. Looked like a dance rather than steps. I'm in a trance by now. Beautiful. She's midway in the road now. Another apprehensive look to the sides. Sprints off. As chirpy like a little sparrow. A beautiful poem got misplaced in&nbsp;a boring page of my book.

      Everyone of us is like the treasure hunters standing in the shore of the sea trying to find the treasure scattered on the seabeds. All you want to do is just pick some treasure and finda name for yourself. Before you jump into the sea, everything looks easy. But when you are into the sea, you dont know which one is glass piece and which one is the gold. You pick some what you think is gold and you come back clutching the to the shore. And each and every piece of it is a glass. Laughs and mocks is all that you get. The same mouths that encouraged you now make fun of you. It wouldn't be the blood caused by the piercing glass pieces that'd make you cry... it wouldn't be the salt water that'll make you cry.. it'll be the mental anguish...the pain of whole world mocking at you that'll make you cry.. You are now given a name "Glass Collector"...You become famous because of your name..But after sometime the pain reduces...though it never goes away cos those scars would hurt forever...you'll overhear the same people telling someone that its ok to comeback with only glass pieces.. the only thing that matters would be that you tried..at that time you will make wry smile cos you know the truth...

      Yesterday, I was totally pissed off. God turned the shower on but then forgot to switch it off. He just slept!!! It so happened that I was riding in my already battered bike. And it so happened I forgot to get my jacket and all I had on me was a skinny T-shirt. All I could do was stop the bike near a chaat shop and land in the shelters of a closed shop nearby. And I have this knack of landing up in dicey places without money. The gang that joined there started to have all those chaats. I was left to look at their plates. It just drove me mad. And after some I decided it was enough. So, I picked up the goddamn bike and started again in the goddamn rain. The tricky thing about the rain it, that it appears so light that sometimes it looks like a drizzle but once you start on the bike, then you know the intensity. It really stings you. My next stop was at a deserted xerox centre. And, the only thing that were to give me some company were some stray dogs who were continuing their sunday siesta. There was nothing in that whole place and the loneliness started to kill me. By the time, I had spent some 1.5 hrs in that rain. My next stop was at a petrol bunk. And believe me, it was worse. It turned out to be a gathering of couples. All kinds of couples. The old ones,the married ones, the stylish ones...and it looked everybody were actually on some goddamn picnic rather than sheltering for a mad rain. Plenty of laughs, wrapping arms...good enough to drive a loner like me mad. And this gust of wind blows. You are wet to the toes. And the wind makes it so bad that you can actually walk to the nearest hospital and admit yourself for pneumonia. Then, in a sudden fit of rage, I started and ended up in one of those shanti sagars. It was all and well there. I ordered a cup of coffee and feeling nice and warm. Then, after some time, this family comes up stand in my table. They have this pav bhaaji, thats giving out its buttery smell all around. My stomach by then has started pinching in hunger. And then this guy in my table goes and gets a plate full of naans and masala. I went mad. This is just the problem. When you struck up somewhere like this, you remember all those best things you had. Crispy vadas dipped in sambars...and you sort of feel you can never even get to see them in your entire life. Its all ok if you get caught somewhere near you house. You can just grit your teeth but getting caught somewhere in the middle of nowhere affects you psychologically. It makes you think about all those ugly things you did the day before. I din't offer this school kid a lift, I refused to give me sis a lift to the busstand, you imagine all the faces of drivers whom you'd have pissed off...And by the time you reach your house gritting and shivering for 7 kms in the rain, you take a vow that you'd never leave your house even if you see a hint of smoke in the sky.And yeah...I take back my statement that rains make things romantic and I'd switch off those rain songs where those heroines act as though they are having the time of their life.

      Recently I received an invitation to join Orkut from one of my friend. My information sources revealed that it was a social networking service(SNS) and it had lots of girls. The second reason was compelling enough for me to grab the offer with both hands. The next round of investigation revealed some more facts. Orkut has been named after one of the the company's employee Orkut Buyukkokten who developed the product in the free time available. It seems Google encourages its employees to utilise 20% of their time to pursue their personal interests, an attempt to increase employees' creativity. Ofcourse, it led a string of thoughts in my mind. But, lets not digress out. This release of Orkut comes in the aftermath of Google's futile attempts in buying out Friendster, another social networking service. The social networking service seems to be a huge market of which I was ignorant till the day before. But here's the smoke in the fire. Days after the orkut was released, Affinity Engines(AE), a company co-founded by Orkut filed a lawsuit claiming that Orkut has stolen the code of its SNS. Orkut, a stanford graduate, co-founded the company after Club-Nexus, an application he wrote for stanford alumni became a huge hit. AE alleges that the company discovered same nine bugs that were in its product. AE also accuses that Orkut had assured he would not work in a social netwroking product in Google. AE claims that Orkut, a Turk joined Google to resolve his visa problems. Google is already facing issues on a large front fighting off lawsuits from Overture, a company that had patented the idea of auctioning the positions in the search results. Adding up the hue and cry is the issue of google providing context based ads in Gmail. So, right now after Microsoft and Oracle, its Google thats facing the music.

      I'm so deperate to post smthing that I had to paste this from one of the other blogs that I contribute...The reason for this is my hectic schedule caused by the project release..NO..my mind still doesnt accept that I'm a lazy couch potato and dont use my creative head other than when filling timesheets and writing my performance plans and results... Anyway...Read on... It was every sports afficianado's dream come true. And if you happen to fall in the category of movie buff, you would have been exhausted by the intake by the time you went to sleep this sunday. It all started with Singaravelan in Raj TV, ofcourse you have to multiplex that with the England - NewZealand cricket match. Simultaneously, after some time, you also have to include Harikrishanans from Asianet in the plan. Mohanlal and Mamooty were an ultimate combo wooing Juhi all the way down to the end of the movie. Watch out for the scene where Juhi spills the tea on Mamooty's lap. Followed by MohanLal's snicker to which Mamooty responds with an angry face. Juhi comes out and wipes out Mamooty's lap with her bare hands. Then you should watch that erotic expression(with the oohs and aahs) in Mamooty's face to piss off MohanLal. Humor can't get better than this. And when MohanLal takes the tea cup and spills it on his lap, it really does get better. Worse, the following scenes evoke more rip roaring laughter. If you dont understand Malayalam, probably this would be the scene that would stand out. But, it was a race of a different kind in Magney Cours. Alonso keeping Schumacher at bay for nearly 30 laps. Still more exciting was the tussle between the trio Button,Barichello and Trulli for the last podium position. It went all the way down the wire before Barichello pulled off a miracle on the second last turn before the finish line to leave Trulli despondent. While you would be multiplexing between these two, Federer and Roddick start to slam. Ofcourse, you cant be impartial, so you also include them in the plan. Roddick's start can't be better. Slams four aces to win the first game. Ofcourse, only after this would you get some breathers 'cause by the time Harikrishanans and the GP finishes. After seeing Federer lift the cup, you had to run all the way to channel # 44 to watch Amelie. You can watch the movie any number of times. A great proof of how artistic French can get. Watch out for the scene, where Amelie melts when Nino walks out of the cafe. By the time you watch Amelie and Nino ride in the moped, you'd have had to get mentally prepared for the last ride of the night. So, if you are an underdog supporter, you'd be thouroughly satisfied when you go to sleep, replaying Charisteas' header again and agin in you head. Ofcourse, the only thing that can spoil your sleep is the thought getting caught in the vicious circle of office and project releases and issues the next day. Otherwise, it was really a super sunday.

      This extract sometime back...somewhere, somehow touched some anonymous chord in my heart that reacted in a maganaimous way....duh.. in other words...this is why named this blog "smaraa" --> Memory,desire.... Read ahead...a nice piece...  Parvati to Shiva "Pleasure leaves no memory. I mean: during the 25 years of our first embrace, when I had just left my fathers house, I often thought, as though making a long journey: I must remember what happened just now, exactly how this moment was, how we got there and how we left it behind. I was quite determined-and everything was quite clear and sharp, but the way dreams seem clear and sharp while we were dreaming them, we decide to remember them and fasten on every detail-and the idea that we might forget something seems so ridiculous we almost smile, because it is all too real, but then we wake up that thing evaporates along with all the rest. Try to understand: everything that happened is there inside me, just below the flux of my mind. But I cant recall the sequence of it all, I could remember far better the sequence of something unimportant to me: how I dressed one day, what makeup I put on, how I went down into the palace gardens, how I walked along a particular path and how I mounted my dappled horse, my two maids behind me, and how my maids were dressed, and the first words we spoke to each other.  Yet Kama, Desire is also called Smara, Memory. Indeed, its as if its his real name. Or at least that's the name I always use for him. And I saved his life, remember? For days I sat motionless before you, at a respectful distance, immersed in tapas. We didn't know each other then and I was just a girl. You kept your eyes closed all the time. When you opened them, you spoke, without even looking at me: "Whats happening?" you said, "Kama is here." Kama barely managed to get back to his feet-he was behind a bush - and to draw his bow with one of his five flowers, before your eye had shriveled him up. Then you looked at me, as though this was the first time you'd really seen me, and invited me to ask a boon of you. I said: "Now that Kama is dead, then there are no more boons to ask. Without Desire there can be no more emotion. Without emotion, men and women may as well ignore each other." So you granted me this boon, that Kama might go on living, but invisibly. When I was a little girl and used to invoke him, looking at the miniatures I'd painted of you, though I'd never seen you then, all I would say was "Smara, Smara..."   ~Excerpt from the book Ka, by Robert Calasso

      இந்த பெயரைக் கேட்டாலே CIA-வில் உள்ள பல பேருக்கு ரத்த அழுத்தம் குபுகுபு வென எகிரும். CIA-வின் வரலாற்றிலேயே ஒரு மிகப் பெரும் ராஜதுரோகியாக விளஙகியவர்.இந்த வாரம் செவ்வாய்கிழமையென்று எல்லா சேனல்களுமாக சேர்ந்து என்னை கைகழுவி விட ஒவ்வொறு சேனலாக கூடு விட்டு கூடு பாய்ந்து எனது ரிமோட் நின்றது டிஸ்கவரி சேனலில். அதில் கண்ணாடி போட்ட ஒரு ஆசாமி கூலாக பேட்டி கொடுத்து கொண்டிருந்தார். சரி, எதோ ஒரு துறையில் பெரிய சாதனை செய்தவர் என்று பார்த்தால் பின்னர் தெரியவந்த்து 10 வருடம் CIA-விலிருந்து KGB-க்கு புதுப்படம் ரிலீஸ் செய்வது போல பல ரகசியஙகளை வெளியிட்டிருக்கிறார். CIA-வுக்கு வேலை செய்து கொண்டிருந்த 20 KGB ஒற்றர்கள், 2 Directorகள், பல enquiry-கள் என எல்லாவற்றையும் ஸ்வாஹா செய்து விட்டு கில்ஃபான்சியாக இருந்திருக்கிறார். இதில் கூத்து என்னவென்றால் ஏம்ஸின் வேலை KGB ஆபிஸர்களை recruit செய்வதும், CIA-வில் இருக்கும் துரோகிகளை கண்டுபிடிப்பது தான்.இவர் வேலையென்று பெரிசாக எதுவும் செய்து விடவில்லை. இவருடன் கூட வேலை பார்த்தவர்கள் நன்றாக உழைத்து இவரை கண்கலங்காமல் பார்த்துக்கொண்டார்கள். இவர் CIA-வில் காலம் தள்ளிய 20 வருடத்தில் இவர் recruit செய்த ஒரே ஒற்றர் - கொலம்பிய தூதரகத்தில் வேலை பார்த்த பெண்மணி ரொசாரியோ. அவரையே ஆறு மாதங்கள் கழித்து கல்யாணம் செய்து கொண்டார். நம்மூர் மர்ம நாவல்களில் வரும் வில்லன்கள் போல இவர் அப்பாவி கேரக்டராகவே வாழ்ந்து வந்திருக்கிறார். 1985-இல் தனது கடன் தொல்லைகளை தீர்ப்பதர்க்காக ரகசியங்களை வெளியிட்ட ஏம்ஸ் பின்னர் அதையே தொழிலாக மாற்றிக் கொண்டு விட்டார். பின்பு 10 KGB துரோகிகளின் பெயரைப் போட்டு குடுத்து $2 மில்லியன் டாலர்களை ரஷ்யர்களிடமிருந்து பரிசாகப் பெற்றார். அவர்களுக்கே உரிய பாணியில், KGB பத்து பேரையும் பரலோகம் அனுப்பிவிட்டது. இது அப்போது இருந்த CIA Director William Casey-க்கு பெரிய தலைவலியாக போய்விட்டது. உடனே ஒரு enquiry கமிஷன் ஒன்று வைக்கப்பட்டது. அதற்குள் இரான் பிரச்சனை, CIA-வின் விசாரனை முறைகளென பல பூகம்பம் வெடித்து விட இதை கொஞ்சம் மறந்துவிட்டார்கள். சோவியத்து யூனியனின் வீழ்ச்சிக்கு பின்னரும் இவர் சும்மா இருந்து விடவில்லை, ரஷ்யாவிற்காக ஒற்றர் வேலை பார்க்க ஆரம்பித்தார். தொடர்ந்து KGB-யில் இருந்த தனது ஆட்கள் குறையவே வேறு வழி இல்லாமல் CIA தனது பரம எதிரியான FBI-யின் உதவியை நாடியது. இவர்கள் இருவரின் கூட்டு முயற்சியில் பல சந்தேகிகள் பட்டியல் தயார் செய்யப்ப்ட்டது. எல்லா பட்டியல்களிலும் தலைவர் இடம் பெற்றார். பிறகு இவருக்கு பல Lie Detector டெஸ்டுகள் நடந்தன. சோர்வாக நடிப்பது, மிகவும் ரிலாக்ஸ்டாக காமித்துக்கொள்வது, Polygraph Tester-இடம் "மாமன், மச்சான் செளக்கியமா?"எனப் பல டகாய்டி வேலை செய்து எஸ்கேப் ஆகிவிட்டார். பங்களா, Jaguar car, சொகுசு பயணங்கள் என இவரது ஆடம்பர வாழ்க்கை பெரும் சந்தேகத்தை கிளப்பியது. கேட்டதற்கு மனைவியின் பூர்வீக சொத்து என்று பூருடாவிட்டார். நோண்டிப் பார்த்ததில் தாத்தாவும் இல்லை உயிலும் இல்லை. கடைசியில் மாமியார் வீட்டுக்கு போய்விட்டு வருகிறேன் என்று சொல்லிவிட்டு வெனிசுவெலாவில் ரகசியங்களை விற்றுவிட்டு வந்தவரை FBI மாமியார் வீட்டிலேயே தள்ளியது. தனது தண்டனையை ஆயுள் தண்டனையாக குறைக்க வேண்டும்,5 வயது மகனுக்கு மாதம் $500 குடுக்க வேண்டும் எனப் பல கண்டிஷனுக்கு பிறகு வாயைத் திறந்தார். போதாகுறைக்கு "நான் CIA சீர்திருத்தவாதி"என்று டயலாக்கெல்லாம் விட்டார். ஏம்ஸ் CIA-க்கு ஒரு மிகப் பெரியப் பாடமாக அமைந்தார். ஏம்ஸ் நிகழ்ச்சிக்கு பிறகு CIA ஏஜண்டுகளை கண்கானிப்பதற்க்காக வருடம் $3 பில்லியன் வரை செலவு செய்கிறது.மேலும் ஏஜண்டுகள் தங்களது வரவு செலவு கணக்குகளை காமிக்க வேண்டும் என்றும் சட்டம் பிறப்பிக்கப்பட்டது.

      காலையில் எழுந்தவுடன் நான் முதலில் தேடும் ஒரு விஷயம் - Newspaper. பல் தேய்ப்பது கூட அப்புறம் தான். தற்சமயம் என்னைக் காலையில் வறவேற்ப்பது Times of India. இதில் செய்திகளைத் தவிர எல்லவற்றையும் நன்றாக கவர் செய்கிறார்கள். Streamer என சொல்லப்படும் Newspaper Title-ல் "Times Of India" என்கிற கொட்டை எழுத்துகளின் இரு பக்கமும் இரண்டு துவார பாலிகைகள் வீற்றிருப்பார்கள். குறிப்பாக இவர்கள் தங்கள் உடம்பைக்கூட மறைக்கமுடியாத எழைப் பெண்களாக இருப்பார்கள். வெளிநாட்டுச் செய்திகளில் பெண் பாப் பாடகிகளைத் தவிர்த்து வேறெதையுமே TOI நியுஸாக கருத மாட்டார்கள். Business Section-ல் கண்டிப்பாக ஒரு ஜப்பானிய தொழில்நுட்பக் கருவியின் வெளியீட்டு விழாவின் புகைப்படம் போட்டு இருப்பார்கள். அங்கேயும் கருவியை விட்டுவிட்டு அதைப் பிடித்திருக்கும் பெண்ணைக் கவர் செய்திருப்பார்கள். விளையாட்டு செய்திகளில் எப்படியும் Sharapova, Kournikova service குனியும் ஃபோட்டோ தான் போடுவார்கள். இதைத் தவிர வேறு எங்கெல்லாம் இடம் இருக்கிறதோ அங்கெல்லாம் Baywatch புகைப்படங்களால் நிரப்பியிருப்பார்கள். இவர்களின் பட்ஜெட் ஸ்பெஷல் தாங்க முடியவில்லை. ஒரே Graphics மயம். சோனியாவை Trinity(Matrix)-யாக காமிப்பது போன்ற கிராஃபிக்ஸிலிருந்து ஆரம்பித்து மிட்நைட் மசாலக்களிலிருந்து புகைப்படங்களை பொறுக்கி எடுத்து போட்டு இருந்தார்கள். இதெல்லாம் பத்தாதென்று பேப்பர் முழுவதும் அரைகுறை ஆடை அணிந்த அம்மணிகளால் அலங்கரித்திருந்தார்கள்.(சே... ரொம்ப 'ஆ'(A) ஆயிடிச்சு...). ஒருவேளை பட்ஜெட்டில் துண்டு விழுவதை சிம்பாலிக்காக உணர்த்தினார்கள் போலும். இதெல்லாம் பத்தாதென்று Bangalore Times எனும் Supplement-ஐ 'அந்த' மாதரி புகைபடங்களுக்காக்வே சமர்ப்பணம் செய்திருக்கிறார்கள். ஆடைக்குறைப்பு Mainstream சினிமாவைத் தாண்டி Mainstream பேப்பருக்கு பரவியிருப்பது நாம் வருத்தப்பட வேண்டிய விஷயம்.

      The Euro '04 was the first soccer tournament i followed completely. And to the surprise of the world Greece became the champions. So i reflected that, if an underdog Greek could win a championship maybe it is time i give it a shot. Well, yesterday i played football again after two years. Before that i have played it thrice in my life.  There is this tiny ground in our campus we use for any prupose. Football is no exception. Four bricks (goal posts) and viola! Three minutes into the game, the ball came to me twice. I tried my best to dribble and pass it to my teammates. I can now confirm that round things are tricky to control. The captain of my team came to me and said "follow me" and started walking. I followed. After sometime he stopped and said "dont follow me". We were in inside our D. A subtle way of saying "you are not good enough to play forward... please defend". I took the hint and never crossed the D after that. Soccer is a very demanding game. Five minutes later, i was running out of air and my lungs became dry. I politely asked some players that if by any chance i would fall and die they should tell my parents that the Greeks were responsible. After the game, the captain came to me and thanked me personally for the two assists which got converted. After that my team captain came to me and told me in the very subtle way of his "will u be coming tomorrow?" (The answer he honestly expected was NO. So i gave him the pleasure. He was very happy) Read "The Inscrutable American" sometime back. There is this time Gopal comments about the way american named the game `Football` when it has nothing to do with foot and a ball whose shape is anything but a ball. How true! Americans!  Today morning i got up and felt immediately this is not my day. Reason being, my roomate was dressing and he was not expecting me to open my eyes. What a spectacle that early in the morning. The lengths(no double meaning intended) these roomates go to improve intimacy. So got ready and kicked my bike alive for the 20 minutes drive to office. No sooner than i reached the main road the heavens opened. Rain. Did i mention, it is official now: my raincoat was stolen last week. Oh God! Why me?  Do u remember  urlLink this . It was a day-time repeat of that. I reached office after 45 minutes. If Akshay Kumar had a competition in the song "Thippu thippu barsaa paani.." with Raveena, it was me. That wet. I was shivering the whole day like i was recovering from a nervous breakdown.   At 6:30, a colleague called out "Im going to play TT in the recreation room. Want to join?" I humbly replied, "Its raining." He gave me the sternest of looks and moved away.

      Two Cops(2 Flicks in French).This is one of the french movie that I saw yesterday.    Scene 1:  Detective Jaures is working on a case of bank robbery. He is at his house talking in a telephone. Hears that robbers worked with commando like precision, threw a timed explosive to chalk out an escape. Strikes a bell. He moves stealthily, takes a file from his hideout. Takes out a few old newspaper clippings that talk about a similar operation conducted earlier.His face taut with emotion. His wife enters the room. Takes the file and tries to look into it. He snatches it saying its confidential. She replies "I dont believe you."    Scene 2:  The younger cop Antoine arguing with Jaures. Antoine ends the conversation by replying " I know why you like me. Thomas would have been my age.". Again Jaures face is inundated with flood of emotions.    Scene 3:  In the end, Jaures looks at the dying terrorist and says with controlled anger... "A promise is a promise".    Scene 4:  Jaures looks at the same newspaper clippings and tears them one by one. The last paper's headline is "Young Cop Thomas dies in the blast".His wife comes takes out the paper from and tears it. Places it on her husband's shoulder and says "I'm sorry, Jaures. I doubted you."   I understood as to why Jaures still decides to be a detective eventhough he's a genuis and could have become the head. Fascinated me as to how much can be conveyed by saying so less. Sort of gave the perfect definition to the word "Subtlety".If it had been any Indian or hollywood movie, there would have been a barrage of tears and french kisses(how odd??). I've grown from an admirer of French movies to a chavunistic. They are indeed masters of aestheticness.

      First of all, sorry for not posting anything for a long time. You know, they cut off the access to blogger.com from my company(Thankfully its back). And then you know I had some relatives come over to my house. And then you know I had to organise an offsite for the team. And You know I was also going through some confusions that affected my already affected mental life. And then now you know although all these above said things are true, I'm good at giving excuses :). I've sort of now decided on the blog allocations. All my daily cribbings, cravings and other nonsenses would find its way into this blog. All the other occasional nonsensical stuff, that I also call creative writings and thoughts would go to  urlLink my home blog . And the other tamil nonsensical thoughts would go to my tamil blog  urlLink laadlabakdas . The last one actually,incidentally,accidentally got mentioned in  urlLink valaipoo . By now, you guys also must've realised that I'm good at planning. Now coming to the actual topic...I managed to get myself lost in the potholed, bumpy and curving roads of Banglaore...not once but twice. That too on consecutive days. On sunday, I dropped Mukund at his home and he started giving me directions. I told him that I had been there previosuly and I knew the route. Well, that was God's honest truth. 100..200..300 metres...got confused. Tried to find my way out but then got confused again. It took me atleast an hour to reach a place that should take 15 mins. If it happened one night, it happened again yesterday. I guess my experimental blood is showing up too much eventhough I know nobody is gonna credit my discovery as "Bala's Route". Yesterday was much worse because I was trying to find a route that was not in my part of the city. The worst thing about getting lost is you cant throw up your hands in despair and say "I give up". And whenever a junction comes up, you really get confused whether to turn, where to turn and the only thing that'll helps you to decide is the breadth of the road. Cos you think the broader the road the more chances it'll lead you to a main road. But I'll tell you that algorithm doesnt actually work. So the pursuit to be another Colombus continues...

      Finally, i could squeeze some time to write something. Had to go off work early for home hunting. We need a rental 2BHK near Kothrud area in Pune (if u know any contact: mrmathi@gmail.com). And for the past week i the cynosure of a little passing game in our project. Both Version 2.0(maintainence) and version 3.0(new release) wanted me(u see, im famous here). Reminds me of the tamil phrase "Athula oru kaal, saethula oru kaal". Both the version's GL's were giving me work merrily until i complained to the more compassionate one of the two that im always hectically loaded. It was a hard decision from the v2 guys to let me go. They warned me about the dark side of v3...and u-know-who...but i said "dark side it is, Period." Now im doing the same work under a different banner. I thought i would be free enough once i moved to v3, but nary i found time to write. So does my fellow bloggers, it seems. Whats with u guys down there? Bals, Ulu...anyone? No post for the longest time since June 16th. Im ravenous for some posts. Last saturday, we (me+niket+parag+vinayak+some imaginary girl friends) went out on a trip to a place called Bajha caves near Lonawala, an hour drive from Pune. The caves are national monuments. Figures as it belonged to the buddhist monks from 2-3rd century. The caves were totally carved out of the mountain looking over a huge valley. They were carved somewhere in the middle of the mountain so that the access to it is harder from any direction. Without the concrete stairs, which makes it a lazy walk for five minutes, the caves would have been a real tough trek to access. There were some 18 caves in all, with the biggest caves: a sort of shrine in the middle. The other caves were apparently dwelling quarters because they had a cot of stone. All these digs were approximately 6.5 x 6.5 x 6.5 with atleast one cot. The engineering and geological knowldge of those monks were unbelievable. Some caves had sculptures as well which i think were not from the same era. Must have been an addition by the Hindu rulers after the caves have been deserted by the hermits. Enough history lessons. Now to the exciting part. There are some 3-4 waterfalls in the vicinity of the caves. The number is less because it havent started to rain real hard this monsoon season. Once we saw the falls we went in for the kill. The water was cold and hard. The rocks were slippery and the thrill was great. We drenched and cleansed as if there was no project deadlines, no GLs behind ur ass. All this while a friend was clicking away the camera. (The pics have come out in real graphic details of naive males in their undies. So out of concern for the female crowd, who visits this site, the pics have not been included. The truth is i have to find a scanner.) Three hours later we had to return as there is a project deadline. Reality! It bites! From then on it was all downhill this weekend.  Disappointments of the weekend: Couldnt get tickets for `The Passion of the christ`. Although visited 3 rental homes we couldnt find any digs as yet. I blinked too long and missed Sunday go by. The MEOW class still dont have any good-looking girls.  Soon u might read in the papers, "Dejected software engineer from Pune took Bajha caves as his residence..."

      Indians have always been guilty of exhibiting a shockingly high divergence between private and social utility. Thus, they will bathe thrice a day but not pull the chain in a public toilet; they will keep their homes spick and span but throw the garbage over the fence on to the public road; they will not pay their taxes but demand all kinds of subsidies; they will bribe for everything but complain about corruption; and so on.    cut and paste from  urlLink here

      People, there are two things i consider that the Gods have always been inconsiderate towards me.  Women and Travel. The first is easier to explain... plastic surgery is still out of reach for a software engineer in India. Second, lets just say that some of the worst memories of my troubled little life are from the ones that involves commuting. Yep, i have been involved in all kinds of travel-messups one can imagine. Marooned in the motel, monsoon stops train spoils diwali, sleep in the bus-cabin with seven other strangers, ticket torn/lost/wet, drunken cargo loading guy, luggage lost.... U name it, i got it. I can officially publish "Murphy's laws: The Travelers edition".  That said, I went home to Trichy from Pune last week after a really long gap. The only thing that serves as a motivation against that morbid fear of mine is the assurance that i'll meet friends and family. The journey, with me involved was bound to be an eventful one. My Volvo booking from pune to b'lore was cancelled. I came to know this four hours before my departure time and i had to settle for an ordinary Southern-travels-airbus which leaves two hours later (9PM) than the volvo. The promised fifteen hours travel was lenghtned by no less than six hours. I set foot in b'lore on saturday around 5PM minus my spinal cord. Meet friends. The purpose of the journey and the torture was rewarded when Moosa, Bals, Jap, Manix, PK, Ulti said things like "reduce ur tummy", "u look different", "U write lovely", "do MS in US only", "what happened to u?". Everybody had a different prespective. But everyone agreed that i needed a haircut. Saw Van Helsing(sorry, no more reviews... im taking Bal's advice). Much talking and some nostalgia later it was time to leave. Manix dropped me at Madivala amidst pouring rain(a Thanks cum congrats cum visa-treat is in order). I was as wet as Sridevi in Mr.India. Boarded the bus that would take me home, trichy. Slept like the drunkurd guy lying in the alley near `Gandhi wines`. Six and a half hour later i was in Trichy. I disembarked before anyone noticed that my seat was totally ruined because of all the rain water i carried from b'lore. When i reached home i was as loose as sand and gravel mix. I hit the bag and thought what i hated most the travel or the journey.   ...to be continued  (The return journey involves a flight from Madras to Pune)

      Sorry guys for the trickling number of post. But have no fear, im not running out of ideas. In fact im fearful that i might forget to post some of the wonderful ideas i get, that i decided to prioritize them. This one came to the top of the list today. Here goes...  Preamble: 	I had this huge cruch on this girl from school days. From 7th grade to 10th. Her name is KALAIvani. (The word KALAI is capitalized because of another reason. I love that word as much i love women. It follwed me my enire life. Well my first crush's name has it. My favourite person cum teacher in the world is KALAIchelvi. My mother's name is KALAIarasi. And my college crush... her name do not have KALAI in it. But wait a minute... I felt miserable and asked the Gods why not. The answer came: She fell in love with a guy named KALAIko. Life was artful again! Now u know one of the minimum criteria i would impose for my to be wife. Okay, now to the subject..) The first cruch(fc). It will always remain in ur minds, doesnt it? Like a scar. Like a curse. Till the grave. I still remember her face and poise so well that i can close my eyes anytime and her delectable face is recalled in seconds (nothing close to Hannibal Lecter). She often comes in my dreams(not those kind of dreams) wearing the same smile and the same perfume, and i go crazy once again. If i had an guardian angel i would know how she would look like. I never told her anything abt my feelings because i was too shy and withdrawn. By God, how i regret that? Today morning, i had this dream.  The Dream: 	I was back in my school. Kalaichelvi madam was teaching Physics like she always does. My school friends were also there sitting besides me. Even my current roommate, S.P.Bala was there: we were discussing a mathematical problem. I immediately realized that im dreaming. So i turned around to the see whether she is also present. Yes, yes, she was there.. as ever, as beautiful, as sweet. My heart was filled with a sense of euphoria even though i knew she isnt real.  	The teacher interupted and announced that she had corrected the Physics exam papers and she would like someone to distribute it. Kalai popped up and collected the papers from the teacher. She started handing out the papers, and when she came to me with my paper, i thought "She is more beautiful the closer she is to me". Then the teacher turned to me and said "you got the first mark". And i think she heard it as well for she had this distinguishably pleasant smile. After she finished with the papers she turned towards me and sat next to me (wishful thinking, i suppose). I was trying hard to see my exam papers while my heart beat was skipping and i broke into a sweat because she is near. She saw my paper and said "i got that problem wrong, can u explain how u solved that?". Even i dreams this was a rare oppurtunity. I grabbed. I was very excited and i wrote all the steps even the ones which i didnt bother to do in the exam. I didnt realise how animated i was getting while explain the things to her, but the teacher did. She came close to us and said "Why dont u two keep your romances outside the classroom?". As i was able to appreciate the teacher's subtle comment, when she went back to taking the class, i turned to kalai and said "May be we should give it a try. The romance i mean." Only after the words came out of mouth i realised how it might have sounded for her. She was stoned by the teacher's comments itself it seems. Mine petrified her. I dont know what to say now. I collected myself up and waited for the class to end without another word. After the class (it was the last class) everybody started to go out and i caught her outside in the corridor. She still refused to see me in the face. As i have never suggested my feelings to her before (even in my dreams) i wanted to find out what she thought abt this(or is it what i think she would think abt this, remember this is my dream still). A drop or two tears formed in her eyes as i muttered something like "sorry...". I went weak in the knees. She looked up and started "You.....only...."  Thats when my roommate decided to increase the voulme of the TV. I woke up with a start and swore under my breath first thing in the morning(i havent done this until India lost to Australia in the world cup finals). Then after my thoughts returned, it struck me that i'll never find out what she thought abt me. It is a curse upon me. The mind can only think where the heart is willing to go. Im still not ready to hear her answer positive or negative. That is essentially the love i have for her. And one more decision was in order.   The next time i see her in person(in reality) im going to tell her everything.

      A few days back Mathi talked abt those gory days of falling for the delectable curves...Just started a small trigger...will be writing on it more...but here's a song that fits to everybody who have fell in love with a woman noticed daily standing in the busstand, the next door project girl who walks by your place, some gal whom you regularly see at the cafeteria at lunch times...for whom you are prepared to do anything (or atleast you think so..) but they dont even know you exist in the same goddamn world they are in.. I dunno how many of you have heard this song...this is by goo goo dolls..But this is one hellova song for one-sided love...Its the OST of City of Angels, starring Cage and Meg Ryan...here you go...   And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't wanna go home right now  And all I could taste is this moment And all I can breath is your life And sooner or later it's over I just don't wanna miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't comming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am

       Be warned: Im not a natural reviewer/critic. Please excuse my un-professional naïve style below. It just some of my observation and not a review. If u havent seen the movie i wouldnt make much sense. Probably u would think im the official blurb writer for the movie. Dont stop there, watch the movie and come back here again.      `Amelie`. I had no idea about the movie except i knew it was nominated for Oscars in the best foreigh film category. As my previous experience with an oscar nominated foreign film, "No man's land": is still fresh and won my hearts many times over (btw it won the Oscars also. Our `Lagaan`, same year nomination, was a joke compared to it), i had high hopes for Amelie as well.   The first time i saw Amelie i missed more than an hour. Because of that i didnt understand most of the scenes. Amelie's father leaving for airport wasnt funny at all. The next door widow saying "...mountain climbers found proof that my husband loved me" didnt ring any bell. But the next time i saw it -from the start- for the same scenes and dialogues i went down on the grounds with laughter.  Combined with a stupendous performance from the lead actress and an orthodox cameraman the director has performed a miracle. I called the cameraman orthodox because the experience of him shows and it always follow the narration like in the old movies. Im not saying there wasnt variety, mind you, it had every shot from the book.  I have never seen so many close-ups in a single movie. Everytime a surprise is reveiled to the character or the viewer (which is a lot of time in Amelie) the camera does a close-up. The movement and the ken of the camera was a thing any cameraman would aspire for(cat disturbing the bead-blinds when Amelie is dreaming Neno coming into her house, Neno's hesitative motions: dipping his hand in the sugar.. at the cafe, Amelie melting after Neno leaves - the camera moved so well that i didnt even feel the movement). Not to mention the pan and the aperture - they were simply inspirng(Amelie throwing her pebbles collection into the pond in the evening time, the cafe scenes which are quite colorful). There are a few shots with strapped camera. And there were only two or three crane shots but still conventional(like Neno chasing someone and Amelie chasing Neno). All in all the cameraman get the oscar from me.     Coming to the story: the story is all screenplay. No shot is longer than 45 seconds. Almost 50% of the scenes has only Amelie in it. This tells a few things. That the editor had to do quite a job compiling. The dialogues had to be crisp and no monologue can be allowed. And as i said before a scene wouldnt make sense unless u get the connection from the previous scenes(the garden gnome's tour and Amelie's father leaving for the airport is wisely and sparingly kept in the screenplay). Almost all the characters (more than 20 people) in the film are devoted an almost equal time & attention in the screenplay.  The director `Jean-Pierre Jeunet` is a perfectionist. I am all praise for him. Every scene is very felt and then filmed. The artistry of him is overwhelming and it oozes in every shot. The visual representation is undenyable and has an upper hand and rather than the conversation between characters. You can understand whats happening even without the sub-titles since it is shown rather than told. The narrative way of telling a story is a risk since it needs a really resourceful script or a gripping story. Here it is the script itself that eliminted the risk totally. The narration had an extempore touch to it but it also provided mood. The entire movie reminds me of dominoes toppling show since the whole story is a huge collection of bits of trivial incidents (somehow attached to Amelie). It needs careful editing and scripting to make those bits interesting and engrossing. Full marks to the editor and the director for this.  If i had to list the top scenes i would have to write the entire screenplay, so i would refrain. But some aspects i liked, i can list..  1) Parfaite of emotions. 2) Cinemascope. Cinematography. (Every frame can pass for a greeting card) 3) Narrative style. 4) Camera tricks. (especially the black&white scenes, Amelie watching herself in the tv, the close-ups) 5) Leaves u with a sense of hope always. Never dismissive. 6) Joyfully sentimental. 7) Amelie's reactions. 8) Connectivity through scenes. 9) The album, especially the mystery man at the photo counters.  Score: 10/10

      Vienna waits for you By Billy Joel..  Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me why You are still so afraid? Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize...Vienna waits for you  Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride But don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Vienna waits for you  Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize... Vienna waits for you.  But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through Why don't you realize...Vienna waits for you When will you realize...Vienna waits for you

      It was every sports afficianado's dream come true. And if you happen to fall in the category of movie buff, you would have been exhausted by the intake by the time you went to sleep this sunday. It all started with Singaravelan in Raj TV, ofcourse you have to multiplex that with the England - NewZealand cricket match. Simultaneously, after some time, you also have to include Harikrishanans from Asianet in the plan. Mohanlal and Mamooty were an ultimate combo wooing Juhi all the way down to the end of the movie. Watch out for the scene where Juhi spills the tea on Mamooty's lap. Followed by MohanLal's snicker to which Mamooty responds with an angry face. Juhi comes out and wipes out Mamooty's lap with her bare hands. Then you should watch that erotic expression(with the oohs and aahs) in Mamooty's face to piss off MohanLal. Humor can't get better than this. And when MohanLal takes the tea cup and spills it on his lap, it really does get better. Worse, the following scenes evoke more rip roaring laughter. If you dont understand Malayalam, probably this would be the scene that would stand out. But, it was a race of a different kind in Magney Cours. Alonso keeping Schumacher at bay for nearly 30 laps. Still more exciting was the tussle between the trio Button,Barichello and Trulli for the last podium position. It went all the way down the wire before Barichello pulled off a miracle on the second last turn before the finish line to leave Trulli despondent. While you would be multiplexing between these two, Federer and Roddick start to slam. Ofcourse, you cant be impartial, so you also include them in the plan. Roddick's start can't be better. Slams four aces to win the first game. Ofcourse, only after this would you get some breathers 'cause by the time Harikrishanans and the GP finishes. After seeing Federer lift the cup, you had to run all the way to channel # 44 to watch Amelie. You can watch the movie any number of times. A great proof of how artistic French can get. Watch out for the scene, where Amelie melts when Nino walks out of the cafe. Also, the dangling pointer in the brain which got initialised when Smitha wrote about me getting kidnapped and becoming a mujahideen would finally get the memory address. What a way to uncover Smitha's plagiarism!!!! By the time you watch Amelie and Nino ride in the moped, you'd have had to get mentally prepared for the last ride of the night. So, if you are an underdog supporter, you'd be thouroughly satisfied when you go to sleep, replaying Charisteas' header again and agin in you head. Ofcourse, the only thing that can spoil your sleep is the thought getting caught in the vicious circle of office and project releases and issues the next day. Otherwise, it was really a super sunday.

      Greece!! Greece!! went the world y'day. Yep, a golden page was added to the footballing gaint, Greece's history. Sorry, no more comments. Im suffering from severe digestion problem from y'day night... cant figure the reason out. Say `TROY` last week. Had to go on a weekday to get the tickets: very crowded these Multiplex gets on weekends. By the skin of the teeth managed to get the tickets and in we(me+2friends) pushed to enjoy the movie. And enjoy we did.  It is a film that provides food for every type of person there is. That is to say it has all the ingredients to it. Action(a lot of it), romance(not as much as many would have expected), comedy(royal humor is always a way in historical movies), heroism(the entire movie is based on it), unexpected twists(u would expect Menelaus to hang around till the end of war...think again), director's touch(handled the protagonist Achilles's relationship with his cousin Patroclus as platonic as possible) and many other things.. The screenplay is not straight out of Illiad. The writers had a go at it. The eight years war was shrunk to a few days and justice was done i would say, sparing the viewer's a bloodbath.  Homer in Illiad would have had more to say about the love of Paris and Helen. But apprently the director's hurry shows when in both Paris and Helen's introduction scene there were caught deep in adultery. Add a bit of humor to the scene and the viewer is engrossed. And hints of humor is placed sparingly in the movie for sake of variety, but not amateurish as to reveal this to the viewer.  Achilles (Brad Pitt) carries a impressive person in every shot. Be it when he says "..it's immortality.. take it.. its yours" or when he is duelling with Hektor in a fight to death.    Hektor, sometimes i felt that Eric Bana should have been cast as Achilles. But at the end of the movie when all is done and said, i changed my opinion. The casting was perfect. The heroism and protaganism of Achilles side-tracks the love story and other things. I havent read Illiad, but i feel if the movie could have been easily made into two parts. 1) Love: Paris and Helen 2) The war: Achilles and Hektor But i have to agree that both of them would have failed miserably at the box-office. Thats what Wolfgang Peterson and David Benioff could do to a movie. Score: 9/10 -Smitha

      I am.  My GL went onsite and part of his responsibility dawned on me. "Yes, YOU!" said my GL. The question i've been asking myself these days is "Am I?". My fear is towards `responsibility`. Can i handle it? Remember the most responsibility i have handled is assemble my PC.  I remember, we always joke on the management guys. Like  "Do they know anything except Excel?" "What do u think they really do? I mean really do." "Do they have development environment on their PC?" "Why? They always get the praises. They didnt write even a line of code." "Q: Hey, in Excel how do we....?     A: Stop right there. No developers know Excel. Go to a GL or PM." "We work our ass off, and this GLs and PMs can surf all the porn..." And many other short stories on monkeys, assholes and hot air are written on the mystical profession that is the Project Management and they failed to put a smile on our face. Although i havent opened Excel yet, i already feel like im in the middle of all those jokes. I dont think i can open Excel at all. It is going to be harder than quiting cigerette.  I was never a peoples person. Maybe that why i took to computers so well. They are easy to understand and a lot easier to control. People on the other hand are enigmatic and unpredictable. Agreed that sometimes computer do behave eratic, but at least they are consistent at it. While i can handle a mean Pentium IV, 3GHz with 1GB RAM and 17" flat screen, i go weak when im asked "When do u think the coding will be completed by ur group?".   P.S: Sorry readers, i really thought i'll forgo my complex and write something sensible and informative here. But i learned that im only good in self-humility. Guess it my style.

      Im not myself these day. I looked into the mirror today and a stranger stared back. Then i realised that the refelction was my roommate standing behind me, making funny faces.  But actually im still very disoriented by all the things i have to do, day in, day out. There are so many things that needs my attention that in the bafflement i find myself attending to none. With only work and home to take care (remember no social life, no girlfriend, no family) im not able to meet the expectations. I cant even begin to imagine what is goin to happen when i would be asked to take decisions at office and at home. My mom words always surfaces during these lean times: "You are the most irresponsible person i have ever known". Quite reassuring. It cant get worse than that. Can it?  So as i try to comprehend why SqlInt32 cannot be passed from a COM component to a web service, my roommate calls and reminds me that we are out of bottled-water and the maid is not washing our clothes properly. And i write my observation on SqlInt32 and send it to the client: "So it is by design that SqlInt32 cannot be serialized that makes them a bad candidate for web service input parameters. So the way out is to order a water-bubble every week and get a new maid."  That day my GL asked why did i change a link in the Design document to point to sidin.blogspot.com and why why in the world did i sign the mails Smitha. Boy, im loosing my grip or what? I had to convince my GL that some colleague is playing a practical joke. I took a lot of effort to sell him that. My aptitude acumen is at its all time nadir. 8 X 3 = : im bowled. And im supposed to crack CAT this November. Yeah there will be a crack alright.. one through my head. Visiting time - 10 to 4: Gunaseelam Mental hospital. All in all i think im doing a great job balancing the whole thing.   P.S: There is atleast one lie in each sentence above.

      The whole process where people get an idea and put together a team, raise the capital, create a product and mainstream it -- that can only be done in the US. It can't be done sitting in India. The Indian part of the equation is to help these innovative US companies bring their products to the market quicker, cheaper and better, which increases the innovative cycle there. It is a complementarity we need to enhance.  - Nandan Nilekani, CEO, Infosys, quoted in The New York Times, March 7, 2004.  Is there any one still working for Infosys?? Urge them to switch the company, you will continue to remain slaves.  Is there any one who has Infosys shares? Sell them, don't invest on the company which has leaders like these..  I had hopes with Infosys that one day they will lead India and Indian youngsters by example.. But if this is the kind of example they want to show. I would like that company to *die*..  How the hell this "bugger" can make the statements like this?  May be Nandan Nilekani or Narayana Murthy can be slave, Not all of the Indians.  Article  urlLink here     urlLink

      Bala has long since planned to get his own DVD collection. He hears about this place where you get DVDs for 180 bucks. Thinks might be a good try to start there.  Visits the place in the pretext of seeing off his friend. Goes to the shopkeeper and asks for a DVD list. It looks like he wants to buy everything out there. But his small pockets would allow only two. So, after a lot of self debating, he goes for Amelie and Shawshank Redemption. Now he comes back home and plays Amelie. So far so good. Plays Shawshank Redemption but the player says "No Disc". Bala is angry now. He goes to the shokeeper in a maddening traffic. Breaks his rear view mirror of teh bike in the process and asks the shopkeeper for exchange. The shopkeeper plays the DVD and it works. Bala can't believe his eyes.  Comes back to his house and plays it. Surprise, it doesn't play. He becomes like a madman trying out the DVD in all the players. But no player would play it except the one kept in that small shop. Bala is reformed. He says "Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a fool in the society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it."

      Honestly guys..I'd like to post more articles because this is one blog that reveals my more humane side rather than the mask of famous writer that I have to wear. I can already see some disgusted faces. OK..now the fact is I have to write two more blogs that sorts of leaves a meagre amount for this one. I had thought of writing an article about Times of India on this blog but then decided to put it as a Tamil version. Because thats the blog thats yielding me a lot of readership cos thats listed on the tamil bloggers list as newcomers. Being listed in the newcomers is like joining as a fresher. Everywhere you go you are noticed. Everybody asks about you. You are the superstar before the axe falls shortly. So I thought if I post more I run the chance of more hits and regular readers. Well, things backfire. If I had kept silent,  I think more peple would have revisited. But then fools cant keep silent. Now what am I writing?? I'm really sorry for the reader who has read till this word. I really apologise.  I can't believe you are so idle. Yeah, now for the big news. I'm going on a vacation. where else but my dream destination and dreamland!!!! Kerala.... The Plan goes like this...Tirunelveli -> Kuttralam -> Trivandrum -> Alapuzha -> Ambalapuzha -> Cochin -> Guruvayoor -> Palaghat(Hopefully from here on..) -> Coimbatore -> Bangalore. So, I'm off for one week. Hopefully planning to meet you guys back with my views on Malayala Panorama. Meet you guys again should I survive the trip.

      Im back! But a pact is in the agenda. U see, im preparing, in many's views, for one of the toughest exams in the world. MEOW(3). So expect a post per week, max. Saw `Catwoman` promos. I love Halle Barrey. But I like Michelle Pfiffer better. For quite sometime i was not able to tell the difference between Gwyneth Paltrow & her. The same happened with Deepti Bhatnagar & Sonali Bendre(I think this is common atleast). But im wiser(definitely) and older(22 years and 11 months of it) now and capable of remembering faces like the back of my palm. That reminds me, im still due one post. The return journey i did from Trichy to Pune on 18th last month. Well, as i  urlLink already told  u guys, the Gods have this thing against me. Now i try to remember what happened during the flight. I realized, I've a very bad memory. But then again, i can recognize all the five airhostess if i see them anytime, anywhere in my life. The other thing i remember was the take-off and landing. 3 to 5 Gs the plane reached during those times. About the plane itself, a Boeing 737, a congested KPN airbus with 3 seats on either side of the aisle is what it is. Nothing great. Greatness was the stewardess.  There was a rookie in the lot and my fellow hot-blooded passenger tried to flirt with her. Boy what nerve this guys have...I just asked for more water...very politely.  And to top it all, Star Movies showed `View from the top` that evening.  All in all, it was one of those rare journeys i did without any embarrasing moments.

       (True incident that happened during the riots in b'lore over cavery water. I know i promised u guys a short story with characters and all... but forgive me i can only manage a monologue here.)   I passed out of college in May, 2002. I was offered a job in a good(`paying` is silent) company through the wonderful thing called `Campus selection`. But nobody told me that they could defer my joining by eight months. They did. Believe me when i say those were the longest eight months of my life. Star Movies ad HBO gave me company through those lean times at home, Trichy. After some time i had to get off that couch, since it was developing a huge dent because of all the lying around. I went to Bangalore where most of my friends(already joined their companies) and two of my cousins lived. I fell in love with the city the moment i disembarked(they have females for bus conductors!). And the daily walk through MG and Brigade road were the best i have done. We would give each girl a score in the Aish-scale (Aish being 100). It was like trying to sort an almost ascending array that is infinitely long. I even managed to get a full-time job in Mangalore for a meager pay. And i would visit my friends in b'lore every other weekend as they were the closest.   One weekend when i was over in b'lore...the still standing Cauvery water issue rose to its zenith in years. With farmers from both states commiting suicide, the tamil film industry getting involoved, buses burnt and all the political stunts it was indeed an acme. The problem is that Karnataka would send the alloted water across the border. TN retorted or rather the stunt parties suggested that Karnataka who are marginally dependant on the electric power from the dams of TN should be given the finger. Im sure it added fuel. There was a sort of mild-curfew in tamils predominant areas of b'lore. It was nothing like in the Mani Ratham movies, where a mob would walk around with assorted varieties of spears and spades. Since nobody was allowed to come outside and even if they did there should never be more than three persons standing together for more than a minute, it was quite calm, nevertheless tense. The situation was under control simply because it never went out of control. Although Mysore and the related areas still showed hostility towards their tamil neighbours b'lore was still unmenacing. My mom got panicky and called me to ask me to rush home immediately. I assured her that there is little trouble and im not coming home and i have to go to work on monday to M'lore.   The Majestic. Sunday night. Cool air. Shoulder bag and water bottle.  I cant read kannada, but i was never not able to find a Mangalore bus from Bangalore. I inquired the condutor standing infront of such a bus whose starting and destination point's words differed only by the first letter, "when does the bus depart to m'lore?". The conductor told me it would do so in fifteen minutes. He was a 45-years-uncle-next-door sort of guy complete with a beer belly, thick glasses and gutka. I gave him Rs.500 and asked for a ticket to m'lore. ...click... The entire area went black. Power-cut. The conductor was actually entertaining a small group and the power-cut made to change their point of discussion to the cauvery issue. The conductor seemed eager to join the conversation. As he gave me the ticket and the change and went back to it. As i was mildly interested in the topic i stood there and tried to decipher the kannada. Im was not good at that. But i know profanity when i hear one. The carefully thought out blasphemy were directed at the Tamils who by their view are directly responsible for this power-cut. The conductor was the most heated one. I had a feeling that he called out to the entire Kannada community to unite against the dark force that is Tamilnadu. He even used some tamil swear-words. Being an orthodox Tamil i couldnt take it anymore.  I walked away and saw the ticket read Seat#35("Penultimate row, God! My spine!"). I went into the bus and depositted my overnight bag in the luggage slot over the seats. I came outside again to light a cigerette. In the light i checked the change the conductor gave me. There was a Rs.500/- bill in the change. He must have thought it was a 100. It would be very simple to just ignore the mistake and walk away a few hundreds richer not to mention the free bus ride. But my upbringing would never allow that. I promptly went back to the conductor to inform him of the mistake. He was still engaged in the same conversation if not with more might. I interpretted him right in the middle of "..all tamils are arrogant bast.." and told him "U gave me a 500 instead of a 100." in Tamil.
