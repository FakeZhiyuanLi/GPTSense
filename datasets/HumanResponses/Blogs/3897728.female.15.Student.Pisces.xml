      was so sad yesterday... Cried and cried... Felt abandoned by the whole world... I choose not to talk to God... Felt so helpless... Why am i going thru all these? I browsed through my whole list of no. and couldn't find someone to talk to.... "Hello, is ??? there? no? ok thanks..." most of them are not at home..... Finally, i decided to call Dianne... We talked, and shared... She shared with me her experiences... I din noe she went thru so much things which i am going thru now... Learnt so much frm her... Felt God talking to me thru this sister... He reminded me tht i need to get back to Him... I was so sorry, i knelt and prayed... He dried my tears and renewed my heart... He give me strength again!!! I love Him... Because He first loves me... who cares if i dun have a boyfriend to love me? who cares if i am going to be a nun nxt time? As long as i have God it is ok... He provides me with wad is best for me... And I will trust in Him... Even during times when i feel down... LOVE HIM SO much!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "The Lord is my strength and my shield; in Him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song i give thanks to HIM."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalms 28:7

      Your Existing Situation  Sensitive; needs esthetic surroundings, or an equally sensitive and understanding partner with whom to share a warm intimacy.  Your Stress Sources  Has lost the resilience and strength of will necessary to contend with existing difficulties. Feels overtaxed and getting nowhere, but continues to stand her ground and still pursues her objectives with a fierce intensity. This subjects her to intolerable pressure from which she wants to escape, but she cannot bring herself to make the necessary decision. As a result she remains firmly involved in the problem and can neither view it objectively nor get rid of it--he cannot leave it alone and feels she will only be at peace when she has reached her objective.  Your Restrained Characteristics  Feels that she cannot do much about her existing problems and difficulties and that she must make the best of things as they are. Able to achieve satisfaction from sexual activity.  Circumstances are restrictive and hampering, forcing her to forgo all joys and pleasures for the time being.   Your Desired Objective  Hopes that ties of affection and good-fellowship will bring release and contentment. Her own need for approval makes her ready to be of help to others and in exchange she wants warmth and understanding. Open to new ideas and possibilities which she hopes will prove fruitful and interesting.  Your Actual Problem  The fear that she may be prevented from achieving the things she wants leads her into a relentless search for satisfaction in the pursuit of illusory or meaningless activities.  Your Actual Problem #2  The tensions induced by trying to cope with conditions which are really beyond her capabilities, or reserves of strength, have led to considerable anxiety and a sense of personal (but unadmitted) inadequacy. She reacts by seeking outside confirmation of her ability and value in order to bolster her self-esteem. Inclined to blame others so that she may shift the blame from herself. Anxiously searching for solutions and prone to compulsive inhibitions and compulsive desires.

      I want to Love You... I want to see Your face... I want to Love You more... &nbsp; Sometimes i think... Life is so fragile... We never know when we will die... May be the next second, next year, 5 years later, 15 years later... We never know... Our days on earth are numbered... And days on earth are preparations for our time wif God eternity... And everyday is precious... Every day is for God... Every second... We were made for God...  Someone said "if we passed a day w/o knowing God more, w/o loving Him deeper, we have wasted the day!" It is true isn't it... Are we going to waste the day??? It is scary how u look around you and you see the ppl around u turning upside down... Are we going to obey God and let Him use us... He loves us to the extent He is willing to die for us on the cross then live w/o us!!!!! He could have saved Himself - but He couldn't have saved you!!!!!!! I love Him... Forever!!!!!!!!! With all my heart, all my soul and all my strength!!!!!! ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      U know... there are times where i can just sit there and dunno wad to do... lie on my sofa and eventually just falling asleep... sometimes i just feel so down and so weird... u know i think tht God placed brothers and sisters in Christ, our parents, just those ppl, yah... He placed them there for us to feel loved... As in, He can't be there physically to be with us... And He knows very well tht as humans, we have a human body... we need physical contact with somebody else... He wants us to love others because He first loved us... He want us to love others with His love... So basically u yourself shld be able to experience others love... But u see... it has been weird for me... I get frustrated easily by ppl around me... i mean they may care for me, or in fact they care for me... they say they love me... they say i may not know but yes they love me... i think it is my problem huh... i dun really feel loved... sometimes i need them... i need to talk... i am not the hehe haha sihui they know... i am the hehe haha sihui who is constantly hurting inside... yes... i do find comfort in God... but like other humans i need someone else physically to listen to me... and u know it is funny tht those whom supposedly i can share with seems distant sometimes... ppl dun like to share with me izzit? i feel tht i am close to u... yet u dun feel this way... u know the kind of feeling... and recently it is quite stress... when my friends around me tell me about my brothers and sisters in Christ... asking me why they like tht, why they can cheat in test, why they can ill talk other ppl.... at least to my friends i dun cheat in test, and i am considered quite forgiving and uderstanding towards others who wronged me... at least to them i analyse each problem... but i do grumble... i am not perfect... they know tht... but sometimes i may seem nice... yah... i am trying to be nice... i am learning how to be good... but i can't answer for my other bro and sis... and i dun wan to listen bad things abt them and forget it... bcoz this is not God wants... i will be listening to gossips... then wad am i suppose to do... talk to them? i tried actually... but wad can i say? hey u are wrong... i prayed for them... and is this wad i can do only? see... there are so many things i wanna share with my friends... my christians friends... but it is hard sometimes... recently something wrong with my body... i cnnt feel concern frm my bro and sis in all saints... maybe i din really tell them... funny la... but i felt it was cool when ginny and gang wanted to pray for me when they know wad happened to me... they have been the ones constantly encouraging me... even wan lin gave me a hug tht day... i wonder if ginny told her wad happened... or maybe ask her pray for me... but i thank God for them... and suddenly daniel pop into my head... DANIEL... u are my coolest friend... the only one who left messages for me in this blog... thanks... u know sometimes u r really cool... really miss u leh... hehe... maybe nxt time we shall go out together... for a movie, musical, concert, wadeva... hehe... OK!!! we keep it in mind hor... really thank God for u... hehe... after all... God did not deprive me of my bro/sis... sometimes He take them away so tht i can grow... so tht i may feel love in my family... so scary... just now got thunder... maybe tht is God signal... telling me tht He will never leave me... yesterday i went for the spook show... wasn't tht great... but the sermon was GOOD... MANY came forward to believe Christ... thank God for tht... then i came out with something... Just a joke... "Be still and know tht I am God" u know why? coz heaven will be filled with His children... So congested tht we cannot move, so have to stand still and worship Him... hehe...

      So many weird things happen recently... Gone crazy... Yesterday i dreamt... And i fell in love... With a guy whom i never even met b4... May not even exist... Funny rite... I even wanted to skip school today so that i could continue sleeping... Why like tht huh? How can i ever dream of someone i never met b4... Furthermore he is the main character leh... I cannot really remeber his face... I rmb he is not very shuai... But he is very nice... The scene is so realy lorh... With my friends and many ppl i know around me... Only diff is this guy... Why like tht??? i dunno la... I am so in love with him... crazy liao... Then i am so proud of Mr Goh Chok Tong... He is such a good Prime Minister... Haiz... But today handover liao... Ok la... I see the new PM Lee giving his speech... erm... i trust Mr Goh's judgement... It is great that he will still be staying in the cabinet as senior minister... although i dun like the thought of him being no.2... but ok lorh... at least he is still in... and it is great tht he said he wanna focus more on the international side... I think he is great... Built many bilateral relationship for Sg with many other nations... And i think he is very shuai lorh... hehe... But we have moved into a new generation... Must have a new leader... then Singapore will have new dream new vision... With our two senior minister as support!!! WOW... it is going to be so cool... I thank God, for He has placed me in Sg... And i wanna pray tht He will continue to watch over this island and our leaders... And i pray specifically for the salvation of our many ministers... I think many of them are non-christians... May the Lord open their eyes and hearts...

      Really cool!!! When u put God b4 everything else... U experience Him everytime... In everything... I was upset... Could not find joy in many things tht i do... It is only when He is in the 1st place, then i will really experience the joy when doin things tht i feel stress about... Like on thursday i so sad... so down... feel so lousy... but during guitar, i told God tht am i going to bring these feelings to guitar? I mean ok lah... i feel stress but somehow i commit it to God... then ok lorh... during guitar i forgot alot of things... i just concentrate on wad i need to do in guitar... so it was ok... Oh then yesterday i went to watch i-robot with my friends... wanted to watch mean girls... but finish liao... then i was so piss off... i dun like robotic show... starting of it i was like grumbling... then feel like sleeping like tht... Until i told myself, "hey! am i going to waste my money? am i going to waste my time here? God, show me wad u wan me to learn from this movie..." Hey... Even robots have purpose! they got 3 laws to follow... and when they follow, everything was good... until here comes a type of robot who did not follow... then the whole world became chaotic... then among them comes "sonny"... He could not find his purpose... Why did his "father" create him? He went to search for his purpose... Eventually found... And he fulfilled it... I think this reminds me of something tht happened in the bible... God created men... He has a set of rules for us to follow... It was good when we go according to His plan... But when we disobey, everything became chaotic... Then "sonny", we are like him sometimes... searching for our purpose... And when we found it, everything was good... We have Jesus... He came down here to wash our sins... If we followed Him in the first place, everything would be fine... But we din, we caused our Creator to suffer... And right now... there are still ppl disobeying... Funny rite... How we are worst then robots... Even robots have purpose... haha... Do we? I have!!!
