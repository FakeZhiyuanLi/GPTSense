       Good evening.  So I'm sitting here, and I'm thinking "Gee, I oughta do something."  Sure, I could just go to sleep... it's almost midnight, and I do have to work tomorrow.  But I'm feeling, for the moment, a bit unfulfilled.  No telling whether typing to no one (and I'm not yet sure if it's no one in particular, or actually no one at all) will punch that ticket tonight or not.  And it's not like there's not plenty I COULD do.  Had a cookout at my place yesterday and the downstairs could use some picking up.  I have a web site or two I need to update.  But that doesn't have the same allure as this.  Of course, if anyone's ever going to read this, I have to be a bit more interesting, don't I?  OK, what do I have?  Funny story.  Starts in high school.  Dated a girl.  Kept up with that through the first couple years of college, even though it was long distance.  Serious thing.  We thought it was a lot more serious than it was -- we were 17, 18, 19, 20, 21... whaddya really know then?  She more than me, apparently, because for the last year or so that we were still "together" (if not geographically then telephonically -- this is before email was available to 99.9% of the country), she was seeing this guy.  This guy, with whom she later moved to the midwest and married, that is.  She and I -- Audrey, her name is Audrey -- exchanged letters a few years ago, and that was the only contact we had in 12 years.  Which was ok with me.  Then, out of the blue, I get an email forwarded from a guy who ran a web site I once wrote an article for.  (Wow, how many misplaced prepositions in THAT sentence?)  The email asked me to call her or email her with my #.  Why?  Sort of cryptic, but something about owing me an apology.  Now, these things don't happen spontaneously.  I gave her my #, she was going to call me that evening.  Hadn't a clue what to expect, and I was a wreck all day... couldn't concentrate on anything, was more or less useless at the office.  Talked to my two friends who knew her to settle me down.  Didn't work.  A couple vodka and cranberries (with a splash of lime juice, each) did.  Then the phone rang.  Audrey sounds exactly as she did 12 or 13 years ago.  For that matter, the same as she did when we first met, in high school, almost 20 years ago.  Except troubled.  Which, admittedly, she sounded like the last year I knew her... but I was too dumb or in love or something to notice and wonder why.  So she wants to apologize for lying to me, cheating on me, breaking up with me and running off with this other guy (with whom she now has two kids) because -- this is the good part -- her husband is having some sort of thing with a woman with whom he works.  (Better use of prepositions there, isn't it?)  She tells me the whole story.  And it's a sad one, made moreso by three things -- their two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, and the fact that Audrey believes her husband when he tells her that he hasn't slept with the other woman.  And I use the term woman liberally, because apparently she's 22 and has three kids and two marriages.  Living la vida loca in Indiana, apparently.  I kinda wanted to ask if this woman lived in a trailer, but that would have been wrong.  This was a most interesting conversation.  12 years ago I wanted to tell her I still loved her and wanted her back.  11 years ago I was just plain pissed -- at her, at the guy, at myself for not seeing what everyone around me did and tried to warn me of, and I wanted to just yell at her.  10 years ago I was still distracted by the thought of her, if only now and then.  9 years ago I moved on.  But there was still always this curiosity, this desire to look her up and ask what the hell really happened.  Around the time of our high school reunion, about 6 years ago, to which I went but she did not, she stopped mattering on any level.  Well, that's what I thought anyway.  A few years after that, I wrote that letter -- I forgot what I said, even, and I got one back from her.  I wrote her another, but that was the last I heard.  I should ask her if she got the second one, or if the husband got rid of it before she saw it.  Hmmm.  Anyway, the conversation.  Instead of being angry, curious, resentful, happy to see her suffering a bit, etc., I was at first a bit shocked that she was sharing all of this with me.  I guess I shouldn't have been, since Audrey and I could talk about just about anything, anytime, anywhere.  We were good together that way.  I'm sure that if there hadn't been the romantic relationshipto screw it all up, we'd have stayed in touch.  But there was.  Yeah, so instead of gloating or stewing, I think I was caught so much by surprise I sort of fell into crisis management mode at first:  Assess the situation, keep everyone calm, etc.  But then, once the shock of suddenly feeling like I was middle of something I hadn't been near for over a decade, I found I really did feel bad for her and want to help.  Of course, the only help I could really offer is to suggest she she tell the one sister she hadn't told about it yet.  I mean, really, who am I to give advice?  10 or 12 years ago I would have said some pretty inappropriate things.  Being the supportive friend -- hadn't been there in a while for her.  But, to I think both of our surprises, it worked.  She shared a couple other things with me... that her husband was still jealous about things that happened between us back in high school/college, for instance, that made me laugh out loud.  I mean, how sad is that?  I'm sure, had he known that in the middle of their little crisis that she called me and talked to me, for the first time in more than 12 years, that wouldn't have set particularly well.  But apparently the dude isn't bright enough to drop the thing -- whatever it is -- with the other woman, even after getting caught.  And Audrey, bless her, is still gullible enough to believe most of what he tells her about the situation.  I felt like the only sane one, which is sort of how I felt (mistakenly then, though) back when this guy was "stealing" her away from me.)  (Side note: Audrey and I splitting up was the best thing that could have happened to me, and probably to her, too.  Realized that many years back.  Had I not had that epiphany I might have learned a lot more Frank Sinatra songs, but also would have approached this whole thing differently.)  So, we've exchanged a couple of emails since then, and it's not getting any better for me.  I feel bad for her.  But she does have a supportive family and two great older sisters who will be there for her when she needs them.  Wait, this was supposed to be a funny story.  Well, maybe it'll end happily for them.  I hope so, at least for their kids' sake.  For the guy, I don't really care either way.  I suspect he'll wise up before long, and Audrey is such that she'll accept his apology whenever and in whatever form it comes.  That's probably for the best.  As for me, I like being on the sidelines when there's drama.  It was nice being needed, though, if only as an ear.  But most importantly... I didn't think it would mean anything to me, and I sort of pooh-pooh'd it because all the B.S. between us was when we were 20 years old -- kids... but her apology to me, I must have really wanted to hear that, if only subconsciously.  Because I just felt great after that.  A breakthrough, a great weight off my shoulders, whatever.  I guess I needed it more than I knew.  It didn't quite solve an unsolved mystery, but it brought closure, even in the context of a possible new beginning for our friendship.  Did we just go from funny story to touching story?  Hmm, probably not.  -A-

       A weekend trip out of town kept me from watching the funeral proceedings live.  So I watched on TiVo Sunday night.  And that was good.  I got to fast-forward through the singing, which doesn't do much for me, and instead watch the maneuvers of the honor guard, hear the speeches, and listen to a little of the commentary as so many of the people I used to work for and with milled about, sat in the front of the Cathedral, etc.  And I gotta tell you (whoever you are -- no one yet, as far as I can tell) I enjoyed the pomp, if not the circumstance.  But what moved me was not what I saw, but what I heard.  I can't remember now if it came from the commentators or from one (or more) of the eulogies.  But at least one person said how Ronald Reagan never spoke ill of anyone.  Sure, he got mad, but he'd never disparage another person, least of all behind their back.  And he was an optimist.  If not an eternal one, at least for 93 or so years.  And I thought to myself how I can get pretty angry, get pretty down, and get pretty down on other people.  My temper gets the best of me, even if it's mostly while driving.  I find myself drawn into -- or even starting -- conversations where the main topic is verbally eviscerating another person.  And I thought, well, that's petty.  So I'm taking a new approach to life.  I'm going to try to be more optimistic.  I'm going to try not to speak ill of others.  If I don't like someone, and I'm talking about them, I'm going to try to be more diplomatic expressing my feelings.    I'm going to practice a bit more of the golden rule than I ever have.  And we'll see how that makes me feel.  So far, I must tell you, pretty good.  I went to the hospital and visited my 85-year-old neighbor.  He has family in town, and I suspect that they'd been by to see him too... and he's only been there since Sunday and should get back home tomorrow.  But I felt good taking 45 minutes out of my day to sit and shoot the bull with him.  It was hardly a hassle, I like the old codger... he's always got something funny to say, and is a good neighbor overall.  If my stopping by cheered him up a little bit, then we both got something out of the visit.  Made me feel good. I don't think I would have done that last week.  I don't know.  Anyway, I think I'll be more fun to be around with my new attitude.  I hope it sticks.  -A-

       I have mixed feelings.  I wanted -- badly -- to go to the library, pay my respects, be a part of an historic event.  So did EVERYONE ELSE.  Traffic on the 118 came to a dead stop four miles from the exit.  The announcer on 1070 said it was an hour to get off the freeway and 4-5 hours to wait for a shuttle bus from the remote parking site (a community college) to the library.  Then a five-mile shuttle bus trip, a walk, the viewing, walk back to the buses, shuttle back and you're done.  Except it took an hour to get three miles from the exit.  We realized the radio guy meant that once you hit the EXIT (still three miles ahead of us at 9:30 or so), it'd be an hour.  And then 4-5 hours (which may have been conservative.  It's entirely possible -- maybe even likely -- that it the sun could rise before the journey ended.  Clearly, many tens of thousands of people who were going to try to go would be disappointed, because the viewing is scheduled to end at 1800 hours tomorrow and if there's one thing the Reagan White House was known for, it's for hitting its cues on time.  (Thank you for restoring a little discipline to that, Mr. Deaver, even if President Clinton's folks tossed that out the window!)  The news said that 2,000 people per hour were filing past the casket, and would continue for 30 hours.  They say 100,000 or so will pay their respects in that manner at the Capitol Wednesday and Thursday.  God bless them all for the many hours they will wait.  I wish I had the patience to do that.  (Though I don't wish that I didn't have a job to be at tomorrow morning, or that I would be inconsiderate enough to take my two friends hostage, essentially.  None of us had any concept how long a process it could be.  It's touching to see the freeways flooded with people and to know that so many people are indeed patient enough and want badly enough to do this.  I wish I could be one of them.  I wonder if many of them just want their one opportunity to be in a room -- the same building, even --  with a President of the United States, living or dead.  I suppose there are some that think that way.  I've been there, so I didn't have that ticket to punch.  It's unlikely that I'll ever be this close, geographically I mean, to a presidential funeral.  The four remaining presidents are not from California, and I am.  I'm certain that there will be at least three more state funerals -- probably more -- in the NEXT 31 years (the time since Lyndon Johnson died and gave occasion for the last state funeral).  I'm skeptical whether I'll make it to any of them.  And I'm sure, some years from now, when I tell people the story of how I ALMOST got to the Library, someone (maybe one of my kids, when I have them and they grow old enough to form such a question) will ask me how I could turn back after being that close.  I don't know that my answer of "I had two friends in the car and they had things to do the next day" or "I didn't know how long I would have to wait" or, frankly, any answer will satisfy them.  Or me.  Still, I wanted to go.  I intended to do that service to the guy who was the key figure in forming my understanding of politics, foreign affairs, and government -- fields I would study and work in for many years thereafter.  If there hadn't been a Ronald Reagan... well, my concentrations in national security policy and Soviet and Eastern European affairs might be more than just history lessons now.  I might be working in the government, fighting the Cold War from behind a desk at Foggy Bottom on in Langley.  Instead, I'm in a job that is important to a foreign corporation in the money I help them earn; important to a bunch of people above me who are more concerned with profit margin than almost anything else in front of them.  Fine, that's business.  I accept that, and hope that people who work for the companies in which I hold stock feel the same way.  But it just doesn't mean all that much, does it?  Kinda makes me want to ditch it all for government service.  Sadly, there's not a government job I can get right now that I'd really want.  And I do want to be able to pay my mortgage, so I'm not going anywhere.  How this went from tonight's events to waxing philosophical on the market economy, I don't know.  But I bet President Reagan would have something sort of wise to say about it.  Or maybe he'd just leave it "There you go again."  -A-

       It's a 35-mile drive, and I'm sure the line will be long, but I'm looking forward to heading up the Reagan Library tonight to pay my respects.  I've only been to four funerals in my entire life (and, gotta say, I'm not looking forward to going to any more, but that's the price of living, isn't it?) so I'm a bit uneasy with the whole concept.  I'm sure that most -- well, many, maybe not most -- of the people going up to Simi Valley tonight are doing so for a reason other than a deep-seated spiritual one.  There's those who are going because they feel like they are supposed to.  One friend of mine (who couldn't make it) said "He was president when we grew up, we should pay our respects."  Agreed.  Some, I'm sure, are going so they can take their children to instill some sort of lesson, well-placed or not.  That's sort of the first reason, projected.  There will be those that want to touch history.  Maybe they saw President Reagan speak at an event, maybe even shook his hand on a ropeline once.  Perhaps they worked as a low-level staffer in California when he was governor, or even in the Federal government.  Or volunteered on a campaign one year.  They figure they'd kick themselves later if they didn't go; the event was so close, an hour or two away, and if they skipped it, they'd feel a bit left out.  I'm sure a good number of folks are going for the spectacle... the news crews, the pomp, whatever.  And they'll get their spectacle, probably no matter what hour (the library is supposed to be open all night, straight through to 6 PM local time tomorrow).  I imagine the scene will come as much from the people in line as from whatever arrangements are ongoing.  And some will go because they respect the man, or at least the office, and internally they want to do it -- maybe even need to do it.  These folks believe the Ronald Reagan did some good as president, and this is a way they can honor that, both internally and externally.  I suppose a lot of people, too, will go for a variety of reasons.  That's me.  I feel like I should go, I don't want to miss the chance to witness an historic event.  I will take my camera, if only to shoot the scene at the community college where the public has to park before being shuttled over to the library.  (I'll go again in a few months, once things have settled down, of course, and get more pictures then.)  But part of me wants to make the gesture, even if no one from his family will care whether I, personally, walk slowly past the flag-draped coffin.  I'll let you know what it's like...  -A-

       Nothing new on the soap opera front since last time.  Which is fine, because I can use a break from playing counselor.  I'm thinking about taking a ride up to Simi Valley to pay my respects to President Reagan tomorrow evening.  He was president during what I'll call my politically formative years, and was the first president I ever saw in person.  (Granted, it was at the Inauguration in 1989, so George Bush followed in quick succession.)  I had the opportunity to meet President Reagan in 1996, too.  By then I'd worked at the White House and met President Bush, but he was at the time just the 2nd president I've been up close and personal (in a manner of speaking) with.  I was in Los Angeles, traveling with two other guys.  We were staying at the Century Plaza hotel, just down the street from the building where the Reagans' office post-White House office was -- the 34th floor of 2121 Avenue of the Stars.  Most of you will know it as Nakitome Plaza of "Die Hard" fame.  Now it's Fox headquarters, and when I went there for work a couple months ago it was the first time I'd been back since '96.  But I digress.  We approached the guard stand by the elevator that serviced the top floor.  Our names were, of course, on the agent's list, and he escorted us onto the elevator and sent the three of us skyward.  The doors opened directly into the suite of offices.  A receptionsist greeted us, and then we sat, a bit fidgety, but silent, in an outer office.  The president was, as usual, running perfectly on schedule, so our wait would be brief.  Joanne Drake was then, and stilll is, the family's chief of staff.  Our boss worked with her in the Reagan White House, and set up the photo op.  Joanne came out to greet us, and told us what we'd do -- she'd take us into President Reagan's office, introduce us one at a time, and we'd snap a photograph.  We knew it'd be a quick affair.  Joanne walked us into the office, and I was immediately struck by how completely appropriate it seemed for him.  Neither grandiose nor simple.  It was smaller (and more conventionally shaped) than the Oval Office.  He had a beautiful desk... perhaps the same one he had in the Oval?  No, probably not, it wasn't big.  It sported drawers on the outer side; it was traditional.  The rest of the décor as well -- light walls and darker wood shelves -- was traditional with a Western bent.  The shelves went from counter height to the ceiling, but the top levels were empty.  Books lined part of one side -- a set of bound volumes, perhaps his presidential records? -- filled one, and a random selection of books filled many of the rest.  And the photos... family pictures in many frames, world leaders in the rest.  I found the quasi-glamour shot of Helmut Kohl the most interesting.  It was signed, but I didn't get close enough to read the inscription.  A western landscape hung behind his desk, over most of the family photos.  His desk was lined with memorabilia -- a crystal stallion's head was the most equine item I recall.  There was probably a Remington sculpture in there somewhere.  And while the desk was clear of papers, a pair of reading glasses sat within easy reach.  This was just two years after the announcement of the Alzheimer's diagnosis, so I'm sure that he had occasion to use those reading glasses now and then.  The president was standing next to his desk when we were walked in.  He was in a brown suit -- something that, to this day, no one ever pulls off as well as he did.  I had a suit with some brown in it, and that's as close as I can come to it without looking terribly awkward.  He was perfectly coiffed, as put together as he always was on camera during his presidency.  He looked older, sure, and moved more slowly than he did eight years earlier.  I suspect by then he was a lot closer to an octogenarian shuffle than the jaunty stride he always seemed to have just eight years earlier.  However, he barely needed to shift his feet during our two minutes in the office, so I can't say for sure.  His eyes seemed smaller, and I suppose that's because of a bit more wrinkling and age spots.  And the hair wasn't quite as startly brown as it was before... the wisps of light grey had grown, if only slightly.  But he still smiled.  Joanne told the president who we worked for, and introduced us one-by-one.  I was in the middle of our little group.  I walked up to him, introduced myself, and he shook my hand, firmly.  We faced the camera and right on cue he turned to the camera, dropped his arms to his side, and Joanne snapped the photo.  I turned to him again and said "It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President, thank you."  He sort of nodded, a slight bob of the head, and uttered a simple "Thank you."  And it sounded just like I thought it should.  We left, all three of us smiling from ear-to-ear.  Joanne took our addresses, and we bid our goodbyes.  I don't think we said a word to each other on the 34-floor descent.  Maybe we just wanted to preserve the sound, or the memory, of the words we shared, letting the scene gel in our heads so we could repeat it the dozens and dozens of times we would have the opportunity to do so over the rest of the day, the trip, and we, suspected, for a very long time after that.  Maybe we were still a little stunned that we had the chance to meet the guy, having grown up seeing him only on TV.  Maybe we were afraid that we'd sound like excited kids to each other, and to preserve our own dignity we'd let it settle for a minute before we blurted out something stupid.  Whatever kept us quiet, the elevator ride ended all too quickly, and the doors opened to a bustling building lobby.  We walked out, past the Secret Service agent at the desk by that lone elevator, and back to the real world.  We were told later that he still enjoyed the visits and the photos, and that knowledge was comforting -- we weren't imposing on his retirement and his last months a of a normal life.  We were helping keep it normal, even.  The photo ops and handshakes are so much a part of the presidential routine, and he did that for eight years -- and I'm sure constantly after leaving the White House -- that the familiarity of it must have been comforting, and the constant flow of strangers into his office a pleasant distraction.  All the moreso, perhaps, because he had less and less to be distracted from.  Of course, I thought about that May day a lot this weekend.  I'm amazed at how much, eight years later, I remember.  The irony of thinking about memory isn't lost on me.

       Audrey called again tonight.  I was just sitting down to dinner... a burger I'd grilled up to, let's face it, perfection.  Cheese in the middle, cheese on top, grilled onions, avocado... if not the perfect burger,  then at least the perfect burger's fraternal twin.  And the phone rings.  First question: Why did I feel compelled, when it was her, to act like someone else was in the room or on another phone and I had to finish with them before talking to her?  I don't know is my only answer.  I'm alone with my perfect burger, but I did anyway.  Ever try to pretend you're talking to someone when you're not and you're doing it for the (muffled) benefit of someone on the phone?  Not easy.  I mumbled for 15 or 20 seconds, and got back on the phone.  Me: So, how're you doing?  Her: I've been better.  Me: Well of course you've been better.  Unless this is the best day of your life, you've been better.  I mean in the context of all the bullshit you've been through the last few weeks.  Her: I've been better.  90 minutes later I've learned that her husband is still communicating with this girl, and moping around the house like having to cut things off with her is a huge hardship... mourning the relationship that (allegedly) never was, right in front of his wife.  What a dumb shit.  About two minutes before she picks up the phone calls me, she tells him that she's leaving.  Now, she means the house, temporarily, with the kids.  Not "I'm leaving you" because Audrey, whatever she does have now, hasn't the fortitude to make that sort of move just yet.  So she tells her husband she's leaving, then calls the last guy she dated before marrying him -- me.  Sure, that was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... and she says she did it because she wanted to talk to someone and not because she wanted to tweak him, but I am convinced there were elements of both.  I tempered all of my advice with the disclaimer that I haven't a clue what I'm talking about, but wasn't shy about giving advice.  Being optimistic for her, but telling her to stand firm in whatever she decided.  Sadly, I doubt she will.  We shall see.  Besides that, it was a lot of joking and reminiscing.  Which is entertaining for me, since... well, since everything.  I don't think she's had anyone to laugh with lately.  I'm a nice guy, aren't I?  She asked me why I was being so nice, and the only thing I could think of is that it's easier than the alternative.  And it's flattering to be asked for advice.  And I am over the months of sadness adn years of general displeasure our break-up caused waaaaaay back when.  Under all that, there's apparently still a close friendship.  Who knew?  Can't wait to get the next call or email... we'll see what actually happens.  I'll let you all know...  -A-

       Nothing of any real import happened to or around me today.  Well, spent a while negotiating rules for the softball playoffs.  Too long, probably.  But the result, despite our team's angry manager's complaints to the contrary, was favorable.  This guy wants EVERY advantage... except where it counts.  In our last regular season game, the opposing team (the league's #1 team so far) was short one woman (it's a co-ed league, obviously).  Rules stipulate they'd have to play with 9 players instead of 10.  Our manager, in his infinitely lacking wisdom, lets them slide on it.  We got beat soundly.  But when anyone else doesn't give him what he wants, he'll raise holy hell.  What is up with that?  I ate my first grilled portobello mushroom today.  it was pretty good.  Still prefer meat, but it didn't kill me, and that's good to know.  -A-

       the change of subject, but I'm still experimenting with this, still looking for something that is interesting to write about, and might be interesting for people to read about.  And I am not yet ready to hit the sack tonight (it's after midnight, I'm up again in seven hours, not sure what I'm thinking...) so I start again.  So I'm at work today, at the magazine.  My job is sort of a hybrid of many things.  I do some very basic writing, but it's mostly marketing-related work.  Today, much of my time was spent doing research for a big event we're trying to plan for next year.  Big, like we could make as much on this thing as we do advertising revenue for most of the year.  Nothing like doubling your revenue in 3 days and 2 nights.  Anyway, I know a thing or two about events.  Enough, in fact, to manage the thing myself, which I may or may not end up doing.  But my boss doesn't believe me.  He asked me to estimate costs for the event, without telling me any details about it.  I tried to tell him that some of the line items could legitimately range from zero dollars to a hundred thousand dollars; that we could spend any amount we wanted to.  He couldn't accept this.  He was sure there was a right answer.  A big awards show costs THIS much.  Yeah, not so much, dude.  You can spend nothing on a backdrop and have a blank wall behind  you, or you can spend a hundred grand to build a fiber optic curtain that rotates sponsor logos continuously throughout the evening.  But no, he tells me to call the corporate woman who planned a conference he went to and find out from HER how much our event would cost.  Now, event people, there's a bit of a fraternity.  Like any profession, I suppose.  People either think event production is really easy... like throwing a small birthday party, OR they think it's this complex beast, like navigating an Escher drawing.  Truth is, it's easy if you know what you're doing, and damn near impossible if you don't.  Cardiologists, I suspect, say the same thing about doing a triple bypass.  So when I called this woman up, and told her what I was told to ask her, she chuckled (knowingly, I hope) and we chatted a bit more, and that was it.  No need to say the obvious -- that it was a dumb question.  I just can't figure out why, when someone (and by someone, I mean my boss) hires someone (and by someone, I mean me) to do a job, that they (the first someone) can't trust the person they hired to do it.  Maybe he's been burned before or something.  In the mean time, I'm getting a little burnt by the micromanagement and lack of trust.  Hope it gets better.  -A-

       So now Audrey, whom I'd not heard from for a few days, writes me again this morning.  She says she got herself drunk for the first time in her life.  Which I believe.  Her drink of choice: Gin and Sprite.  Which, surprise surprise surprise, she found kind of nasty.  But she's not drinking for the pleasure.  Or even for the escapism.  Clearly -- to me, anyway -- it's to get attention from her husband.  She did this at home, with him home.  I guess if you've lived your whole life coloring between the lines, something like that is pretty wild.  Then again, she also told me back when we talked, that she got her belly button pierced... purely to do something "wild."  I think in rural Indiana that is shocking.  Here in L.A., of course, that's still flatline conservative.  Then again, in L.A., tongue piercing is just barely weird anymore.  Anyway, 34 years old, first time drinking liquor to excess.  You go, girl.  Except that she didn't say that the guy suddenly came around from whatever idiocy he's in... her cry for help went largely unheeded.  What next?  Smoking?  Poor girl.  Funny thing is, the first line of her email this morning (the first of a half-dozen back and forth throughout the day) was "I don't know how you became my confidante."  Me neither, sweetheart, me neither.  But then again, it's kind of flattering in a twisted way.  I made some progress on the BBQ leftovers today.  I was so enamored of my own cooking that I was positively salivating on the drive home this evening, dreaming of the burgers I was going to grill up.  Yes, plural.  Two big ones.  And I reheated on the grill an ear of corn.... wow, that was even better two days later.  The burgers, besides being stuffed with gorgonzola cheese, I also added grilled (in tin foil, with a little olive oil) Maui onion, more gorgonzola cheese, and a 1/4 avocado.  Did that two times.  And had some potato salad, and later, a cookie.  When do I get to the gym, that's my only question.  Well, can't wait to hear what new misadventures from Indiana tomorrow will bring.  My dear sweet ex, the soap opera fan... well, she's in the middle of one now.  -A-
