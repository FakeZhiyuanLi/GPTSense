      This is a single use snap shot camera where u can find it any where. But it surprised me because this one use negative film of ISO 1600 which in Thailand you need to go to the professional film shop to get one. My mom just came back to Japan and she said that she still have some pictures left in the camera so I took the camera and try to snap some thing from it.. When i took a closer look at it .. wow ISO 1600 with flash for a single use camera .. wow .. I have been amature photograher 3 years now .. but i have never use a iso 1600 film at all. I have been using pushing film technique.. and my mom doesn't know any thing about the camera, just point and shoot .. used this kind of high speed film already .. can't wait to see how the pictures going to come out.. =) by the way it's from "Konica Minolta" with flash... cost 1134 Yen .. or about  9 us dollars .. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Umm can say that's a gift from god...   I went to a world civilization class and found that the class was cancelled. I didnt come to the previous class as I have to present proposal of my project. So I came down from the building and sit in my usual spot and think what the heck will i do in half an hour ? and definitly I decided to grab myself a lunch.. I went to the plaza to get a lunch box .. (some kind of rice in curry powder with chicken, shrimp, and squid) the tate wasn't that good but i was too lazy to go in the resturant. I found the girl.. yeah.. usually i don't see her much during this semester and on friday i have class the whole day and my usual lunch was sandwish. she has a break also at that time so we have a chat until 2 pm and i have to go to class and she went to the computer lab.   Nothing much happening there ...  and in the afternoon after I got back to Huamark campus, i went to return and hire more commics and went to sit at my usual coffee shop .. and i again met her.. well actually i wanna see her again ..   as i read commics she came to the coffee shop and we have a chat again ... (know u guys are boring right?) and later i found out that she gone out with someone already .. but i didn't feel sad or broken heart at all.. actually i didn't feel anything .. and i have learnt alot about her today also ..  I think i have made the right decision .. she want some one to look after her .. have time to take her out, get some food to her and stuff.. and i feel that i can't be doing that at the moment..  so for now wish her to be happy with her bf .. and i will keep her as a good friend ..   u might ask gift from god that i found her have a bf ? the answer is yes .. and i am happy for her .. just wish that the guy can take care of her real good ..

          [Testing the train with a car full of sand bags]      [The tracks]  link to the  urlLink subways station I took ..     Yesterday morning I watched a news program (cant remember the name of the show) and one interesting news apart from news of environmental activist, Charoen Wataksornthere (quote from  urlLink pisal's blog  ) is a grand  opening of the subway on July 3.    As you know and some of you may already have been visiting Thailand, the major problems is the traffic jam.. I don't know why even the oil prices has been raising and people still using their own car. and I mean 1 car only 1 driver and no passenger.   Still don't know that Thailand is still a poor country? coz I see many new cars on the street every day .. and some are the Europian cars like BMW, Mecedes Benz, etc.. People complaining about the high gasoline prices but they still drive their car.  Again maybe because of the public transport are not as good as developed countries as us Australia and Japan (Only 2 countries I been to =( ) They have a proper bus, train schedule. So people can estimate the time to get to the place they wanted to.   But in Thailand the good estimate is during rush hours can prepare yourself for about 2 hrs. to get to a short distance .. for example to get from my place to uni is takes about 15- 20 min by taxi without traffic (offcourse there are some short cuts where the bus couldn't go but not much) but if i go on a bus during rush hours i have to spend about 1.5 - 2 hrs to get to the place inculding time to wait for the bus..   I wish for better transportation ..    urlLink more news on subways

      ieiei I should say three-times happy ..   Happy No. 1 is that My cousin in the states (Sandy) replies my mail. It's not that she never reply me but I have been sending email asking how she is and all those stuff. Before we used to see each other often on icq and msn but now she's been working and stuff plus the time different in Thailand and the states so my night is her day and her day is my nite .. ieiei so how we suppose to see each others ?   So yeah I am really glad to her from her and we exchange our blogs and she shows me her photo web in yahoo also. She's like me, like to travel around and take pictures where ever we can :). She has many interesting pictures especially my other cousin .. her brother offcourse .. !  and yeah  congrads for the new boyfriend  ..   Happy No. 2 is that last nite when I am about to log off my internet .. (I still use the 56Kbps modem)I saw my secret girl (feel funny to use the word admire) on msn and we just say hello and ask how she is doing and stuff. I haven't see her lately so wanna have some chat .. and she say that she couldn't find the information for her project so I went and help her searching for a while. Anyways I didn't help her much as we can't find the info for it..  Well  urlLink Jeremy , I understand what u say and thanx for that .. I feel the same as what u said also but now I don't think it's the right time yet .. I am pretty occupied myself with projects and stuff.. but i'm sure she has some hint already :)   And Happy No. 3 I actually we .. my friend and I went pass our project proposal without any trouble. Means that we don't need to do extra work. Our scope is cover the project enough and we haven't got many questions from the comitttee also. that's really great for us. coz we think our scope is cover enough already and our technical skills are within the limit we set our scope for.   The other groups who went to defense their project before us got ask many questions and been asked to add modules and increase scope and some have to rewrite thier project.   luckily our group just need to rephrase the wording and few corrections. which is recentable. means that the paper could be resent again in 1 hrs maximum if edition.  U should see when I come out from the meeting room, I was cheering out lound .. YEAH !!!! lucky no one is in the hall way else the would think that i went crazy :)  well that's it for today ..

      Even though I have seen u few times and I might have not talk to u at all. We are not close but I really feel sorry for u.   Pung a 21 ys old height about 155 weight about 40 was murdered by a 15 yrs old boy. in the news paper say that he has to kill her because he was self defense. But my friend says that his uncle known the uncle of the girl cliam that she was stabbed 7 times only because she was screaming for help. and the boy was the girl's brother's friend. He only come to rob the house to to out party...  He is going to be a big murderer when he grouws up if my friend's word was true. but to kill some one just to rob is very bad .. even to rob some one or steal from some one is bad already..   Why can't the kid just stay home? he should not need the money to out at nite at the age if 15? I really want this guy punished to the maximum count that the law allow and don't want him to be back walking on the street..  Rest in peace pung... see u in heaven..

      Last nite about 10.30 I was preparing myself to watch Euro 2004 football and there was an fire alarm sound. I telephone the office in the building. I am living in a 20 floors high resident building and I am also a volunteer fire fighter. After I got the information that the alarm is from the 13th floor so i walk down the fire escape stairs. Met with about 3 security guards and we check every room on the floor but there is none and after that the security guard told me that there is another alarm on the 18th floor so we go up and check.   I have checked 13th-18th floor and emphersis on the 13th and 14th floor as we smell something. But after many time checking there is no signs of fire. so we split up.   Got to my room and watch the second half of football match. Feel sorry for the Germans that they could not score the Latvia and Latvia should have got a penalty kick at the end of first half. :)

      I have thought about this few days ago and didn't have time to post. Feeling uncertain about what would I do after graduation. Actually I have never felt this way before. Not even during last semester. Before I just felt that I have to take only 5 more subjects and complete what we call training project, which could be equalvilent to mini thesis and I could be free from student status and become a complete working man.   But some how I felt that this world is so big and I am going to fight many other graduates bear hands. I felt that I am not as good as others, not as smart as others, how to start looking for jobs, etc. Actually have known all the steps already. I used to feel that I could manage many things eventhough I am not academicly as smart as others but I have more experience inside university and been working out side campus a little.   Since the semster began, I felt that wow I am really getting out and I felt that I am not quite ready to get out yet. I still want to be baby sitted. Why? I couldn't explain myself. I've been study bachelor degree for 7 years now and I am 27, I should be start working and get married soon. BUT I looked at myself that am I that skillful to fight? which ring will I fight?   My thought for now is to graduate and maybe go back to sydney to open my eyes and ears to look at the world. Maybe to America or some other countries. I still want to travel around the world and taking photos. Maybe working part time and travel around that area and move on.   So life after graduation is still mysterious to me...

      Yesterday, (fri 18 june) I've met my secret admire who studies in my uni after haven't seen her at all for a long time. Actually only once when she was on a fone since the semeseter began.   Why don't I make a move? well, I've met her after I broke up wih my gf a while after and she seems to be a nice person and very cute. First time I saw her in a big group of people who hang out in the court yard in the uni with a group of her female friends and some guys also. It was quite a big group. We came close after not a very long chat and I felt as if I have known her for years.   But during that time I was studying and also have to work part time in the SDS group(event organizer). I didn't have much sleep at all. Coz of working and studying at the same time and I felt that I was really tired plus I just broke up with my girl and could not face another broken heart. As I said, she is very cute and very nice person so there should be some competitions and I felt I'm not ready.  And again this semester is my last semester with lots of reports and projects still feel that I didn't have time for her. And time to start a new relationship yet. Only see her face for few seconds can make me happy already.   And today (18 june, 2004) I met her at the coffee shop where I ususally hangs out and do projects while I was having a piece of cake, orange juice, and reading commic waiting for Pisal to telephome for dinner. She came there and getting ready to go for a seminar. We had a chat for about half an hour which seems very long time.   I think she might have some hint already that I like her but I am not ready to tell her yet. Maybe she won't know it from me. Hope she have a good guy to take care of her ..

      Maybe after the Soccer match, this morning I was preparing to go to a class which suppose to be at 12.30 - 14.00 but I thought i was having a class at 14.00 and I didn't realized until a friend (Eak) called and say that he could not come to the meething this afternoon and try to arrange for tomorrow. Than I was realized that I mixed the days up. We had a good laugh.   Imagine wating a whole day doing nothing. wake up quite early morning around 7.00 am and checking email and go through some points on the project and spend 4 hrs of transport back and forth between my home and Huamark campus and from Huamark campus to Bang Na campus and come back.   Well the good point is that I have dinner with  urlLink pisal   and his brothers, do some snack shoppings and went to his house watching NBA game of Detroit and Lakers... was a good game and the Lakers was loss.. Than we have our own game of NBA live 2004 on ps2. After that turn on Euro 2004 and watching first half of Greece and Spain while Spain was leading 1-0. As I am writing this the Greece had a equalizer of 1 - 1.

And cheering Soccer EURO 2004. our favorite team for the match LATVIA and they were loss...!!  I drag my sleepy soul home.

      Well, Today I woke up little late at about 9.30 am as the Euro 2004 fever. I was watching croatia and swizerland with no plan today so I deciede to sleep in abit. I was about to wake up, got a phone call from a friend that My other friend (DJ) is going to a singing contest and the event is just accross the road from my house. I jumped to the shower and get dressed.   I took 2 rolls of films of ther people and my friends as well. From watching we have talented singers and bands and I was feeling good because some of them are aged about 12 and got to final 18s. In later afternoon would advance to final 5s and so on.

      Last nite i went to the miracle melody concert with Pisal, win, por and yui. the concert played by Richard Clayderman and Saksit Vejsupaporn (tor+), it was really great.   the concert was arrange in first half played by Richard Clayderman and the second half played by Sasit. I think they should arrange some thing like 3 songs each. and I feel that the lighting for Sasit wasn't as good as for Richard.  The sitting now they make it as stand where the back rolls are higher above the ground. which i found it's good. better than George Benson concert where all the seats are in the same level. but the stands is wobbling and make lots of noise when people walking. and the sits are not confortable. =) appart from that it a great concert. and Sasit played way better than i thought. I saw him in last chirstmas at my university and also at the freshy nite last friday came to my uni again as member of B5 band.    More over, after I got home i found out that the water pipe was leaking and so my mom and i have to move our wardrobe out to clean the floor and i use tape to tape it but it didn't work that well. any way plan to call the plumber in the morning.   that's my joy and boring day ... -_-'

      Umm today I went out to IT mall to meet my mom for dinner .. and so i went looking around and thought to myself that I should get myself an internet account. so i look at the sign at the shop say JI - Net 250 Baht for 30 hrs ... really faster than normal account, tested already.   so i think should be ok .. than i come back home and installed the cd and stuff, but the internet connection from Ji net is still slow ... so i didn't think much of it, i disconnected. dial again with easy TA account. there working fine .. but when i loaded the web page with ie, it keep asking me for the ji net password .. and i enter them few times and it still didn't work.  so at the end i uninstalled the program that come with JI-net. i think it use some kind of proxy or some thing .. but the bad thing is that wouldn't work with other isp ..

      Yesterday, at my university there is a freshment party or we call them a freshy nite (actually it's from mid day to mid nite). i went to the uni with all my full camera gear plus the text books and the lecture notes so once i got to Huamark campus can start shooting right away.  Actually to go to the freshy nite is my second priority. My frist was to go and have dinner with my friend, por. but he contacted pisal say that he has an urgent work to do so he couldn't come today. Pisal also has an urgent work to complete.. so ok, i just start shooting the cheer leaders from diffent faculties.  after that went to have dinner with pisal and rut can to join the drink (pepsi). After dinner me and rut came back to the party as pisal was having headache so he wanna go home and rest.   So i continue taking pictures of the prince and princess (beauty and handsom contest) plus a music band, b5.   Upto the second last song of B5, around 9.30, the rain start to poor.. lucky i have a hint that there is going to rain and i have about 5 frames left in the roll, so i just shoot them all and packed my bag. but i couldn't leave the ground yet as i was standing in front of the stage and there were people surounded me .. but once the  rain starts to drop, people immediatly leave the ground and the concert and the party is officially closed.  but i couldn't leave my uni yet, actually i could not get far .. just ran accross the road and sheltered myself in front of a game shop .. rain keep on pooring and the water started to flood.. up to the foot path area .. which is usual for my uni to flood around that area..   so i went with my friend to the studnet council building and see what i am going to do later .. and i met rut and he didn;t had dinner yet so i went and have some jelly with him.   finaly note calls and ask if i wanna a lift home .. how can i refuse ?? i packed all my camera gear in zip lock bags  and slowly walk to meet him. the rain now nearly stop around 11 pm .. but the water is still flooded ..   my first freshy nite that there was rain until we the party was ended (i am at this uni for 7 yrs now)

      After a whole week using extreamly slow internet, i thought there is some thing wrong with my university's dial up modem (Yeah we still using 56K dial up modem)server is down and the TA express (ISP that provide pay per use) that I usually use has lower their bandwidth to make people switch to  the ADSL.   Until last nite i was thinking about the VIRUS or WORM ..

      On monday was the first monday after the subways officially opened last sat. The traffic is really lighter than usual. the bus is not a cramp packed like a canned tuna. many buses are half empty..    Just wondering after the promotion, the traffic and the bus is still be the same ??  also wanna longer route and more connection with the bus and train.

      Tuk-Tuk - Some how it is becoming symbolize of thailand already. If you come to Thailand without a picture of u ridding on one of these, u haven't reached thailand yet. I don't know the history about it. but i can say that it fun ridding on it and feeling hot also .. there is no airconditioning. Plus some foreigners are over charged. So if they asking more than  50 BAHT U CAN SAY IT'S EXPENSIVE.. nornally they go in a short distance anyways .. price starting for 20 baht (hardly can get that)..nornaly the charge about 40 bath for about 5 km..&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Today I have to get up quite early in the morning to go to the temple with my mother. So we decided to catch the subway which is not far from my place. Plus the promotion is 10 baths per ride. Until the Aug. 12, 2004 or HM the queen's birthday. Ohh I was going to say that, now the train just start rolling. there is no ticketing machine. so we have to buy the token at the counter .. and they have to enter the value one by one which is very slow.               the pic is my mother :)&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      This was inside the train. The interior is not different from our BTS Sky train at all. I can't believe that there are this many people would catch the train in the sunday early hours like this. People are excited about the new subway system. Not only me who bring the camera and take a snap shot. there are some people who really taking pictures of the family or friend on the train. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       urlLink    This is one of the pictures I took at the ICT expo 2004 at Impact Arena, Muang Thong Tha Ni. August 7, 2004.   That day was so crowded. Like there was a million of people was there (just imagine). There was also 3 fairs that held at the same place so that makes the traffic go worsen.  So my friends and I decided to stay only for an hour. We could not get inside every booths. Actually just walk pass and have a peep. If it was interested than we go in if not, than just walk pass.   Any ways I got some opportunities to take pictures of the presenters there. They might not look too good, as I said that day was too crowded and I feel lazy to get them to the actions I want.   Anyways here is the  urlLink Link

      Some research said that many people are hooked to the internet.   I thought that would never be me ...   that was old habbit before i go on broadband. I used to just logon the net, start outlook express and msn messenger, and browsing some web.   the maximum time i could spend is 3 hrs at the time.

Meet at victory monument 2pm. Arrive at ABAC BangNa campus 7pm. Dinner at Siam Brevery Hotel After that .. still don't know..  but he called and say the professor hasnt come yet and still don't know when will he comes. So I told him that I will go for dinner anyways coz i had meetings with friends already. If he can come, just call me. i will pick him up.  So this would be a dinner without him .. but really want him to come      (from left to right)...Ton and Pia...

      Mann .. today waking up eagerly waiting for my ISP (true) to open up ports for my ADSL connection:  turn on the notebook at about 9 am no signal .. ok no worry .. use normal dial up, 56k ... and use internet for a while   10.00 called the service center .. for my user name and password .. they say my account is due to be open around noon. and after that they ask for my thai id card no. than they gave me the user name and pass word.  after that i start dialing the ADSL modem  and this is the messge:       and i thought there is some thing wrong witht the driver and stuff .. so been uninstall the driver, checking the manual and all ...  every thing is still the same.  and i thought .. hang on is the ISP openning the port for me yet ? so i called and ask again .. and they say .. ummm i could not tell but should be about 1 pm...   ok thank god at least it's not from my side ..   so about 40 mins i would be traveling on Boeing 747... (if i riding concord would have some thing like T3 connect to my house :))

      Today suppose to leave home for temple with my mom early in the morning but she got little lazy so we left home around 11 am. Our first plan is to have lunch at the Yaowaraj (Chinatown). then to temple, after that hair cut, shopping and home.  Ok, once we got on the bus and i took little nap as ususal. and i woke up remember that my friend sent me a forward mail about places to eat in the chinatown and i completely forgot about it. As i don't know many places to eat in china town during day time coz they are more of the gold shop and fruit shop or chinese hearbs, medicine and stuff. But at nite .. man lots of food.  anyways so i try my luck and found a small noodle shop between the gold shop and bank of asia. looks good. once i look inside the shop. Ohh my god .. the shop lay in a small street between the gold shop and the bank as i said but the street is some what 500m deep and pack of all the people eating and some ware waiting, but not for long to get a seat.       Once we got our table ... I ordered 2 dried egg noodles and my mom got a small rice noodeles in soup. they all default comes with look chin or the asorted balls (such as fish balls)..  urlLink Lyhn  has all the definitions about balls already =)  so at the end we had 5 bowls all together .. i had 3 and my mom had 2.. really delicious.  after the nice noodles we moved to the temple .. and i am going to skip that .. not so interesting.  but later when i got my hair cut.  well it is not my usual barber that i have a hair cut this time. I went to my mom's salon. Yeah a salon. Actually not realy strange for thai to go for a salon these days. like some have a unisex service already. like my old barber was also like that .. unisex one.  ok back to my mom's salon. we were tricked that her ususal barber is working today. the one she really recomemd me to come. a gay barber but cuts really good hair and cheap... sounds good to me..  ok once i got on to the shampoo bed and the worker shampooed my hair my mom found out that the barber wasn't in today. she got little angry but never mind.   so once i finished my hair cut.. look what i looked like ??       "???? speachless right???"  anyways .. i'm not too serious about my hair .. it's going to grow back in a month...   ok got to go now guys .. take care ..
