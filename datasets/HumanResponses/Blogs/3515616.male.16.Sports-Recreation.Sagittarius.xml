      Finally I got the will to blog again.Its been kinda dull week wif school and hockey goin on.Spent monday in school listening to another boring history lecture.Damn she keeps on repeating herself.There werent even notes to refer to.This blog is supposed to be happy do i wont complain much.Geog lecture was a blast.Some how i sensed that ms lum was really energetic and happy as she made us play some games to help cheer us up.And she was able to complete the whole chapter in just 2 hours.That was a damn fast lecture.Hockey is fun as always.Learned new skills from a great player.Hahahha.There was basically new drills to do.Trapping a ball in different situations.Passing drills.Then the game against the gals went well for the boys.We achieved a resounding victory yet again.Although they may have been some unfair refreeing on my behalf during some part of the game.Today was a day when i was able to basically complete at least 50% of my homework wif just 3 days left b4 school starts again.Did it at King Albert Park due ti isabelle's request.It was a bit noisy cos there were quite a few groups of secondary school kids.I guess they are still immature.Heheheh.Then went to queensway wif my pal fit3.Bought a new pair of street soccer shoe.Its really cool.And lastly.England sux.Portugal is the greatest team in the world.England is so boring.Playing defensive soccer after taking the lead.How lame is that.Then Beckham missed yet another penalty.He sux.The English are basically the worst team in Europe.Hahahah.Portugal will win this tournament.There's no doubt.Thats all.Hope to blog again soon

      Yeahzzzz...I found paradise finally and its treasure.Okiez lets see where I should start.Left on Saturday.Damn it was one hell of an early flight.Woke up at 4.30 n left home at 5.30 to go to the airport.Reached there still blury from the lack of sleep.Checked in and just hanged around the airport to pass time.Had breakfast b4 boarding the plane.It was a really full plane eventhough it left so early.The food that was served sucked.Man its so dull.Reached Jakarta at around 9 to catch the connecting flight.Boy oh boy.Jakarta is an hour behind S'pore time so we reached there at 8 Jakarta time.Had to wait a full 3 hours.The airport there was so damn dull and boring.Not like it used to be.It was like so empty.But still there were shops.Finally got on the plane to Bali.Here i come.The food on tis flight sucked too.Wat the hell was that.They gave a piece of pizza and a banana fritter.Is that all i was wondering?Damn was the food lame.Got to Bali feeling rather good.Had to wait for the rest b4 we could go to the hotel.Man the hotel's damn cool.Hard Rock Hotel Bali rocks the Planet.Yeahzzzz.Its so well decorated.It has all this memorabilias all over the hotel.Guitars from rockers and famous musicians awards.Boy its like some damn museum.Even I got this tag that makes me a star at the hotel.Man the room was cool.The single bed was damn huge.Ok ok enough of the hotel.But its soooooo cool.Spent the rest of the day shopping.And just walking around the city.The next day i left for a trip around Bali.Saw a play,visited silver making shops,a monkey forest,an active volcano and of course eating dinner while watching the sunset.The second day was damn tiring.Wats worse is that the Euro 2004 is on.Then im like so spent every nite.The third day was  spent on this high speed catamaran near another island in the Indian ocean.At first when the catamaran was leaving the harbour it seemed to go at a slow speed in the calm sea.But i was so damn wrong.The catamaran picked up speed as it entered the ocean.Boy the huge waves and the high speed made the skip rocked like one hell of a loose rollercoaster.It did make some of us seasick.Reaching the island made me feel better that the rough ride was over.I did some snorkelling,canoeing,riding the banana boat and the surf bike and of course the submarine ride.But i was feeling sick in the submarine ride after lunch.It made me really sick.And of course i puked at sea.Luckily no one saw as the rest were still beneath at the viewing gallery.On the way back i puked on board the ship.Damn that one was witnessed by like 30 people.But still even the strongest of people must become weak someday.Damn thats bullshit.hehehhee.I went back to the hotel to shower and get something to eat.Then i went shopping again.Damn i've been shopping for like to past 3 days.That nite i went to this restaraunt thats kinda nice.Sitting at the veranda eating the local delights.Then went shopping again and visited the site of the bombing.I returned today in the evening.I felt kinda sad cos i really fell in love wif the place.After all this experience in the last 4 days, i felt kinda sad on the whole.The ppl are like so poor and struggling to live.They scrapped through their daily lifes while i spend like its nothing to me.Wat i spend eating and shopping in a single day can support their lifes for a month.Imagine the amount i spent in the 4 days.How many months they can live without working.On the journey to the airport, the driver told us that he keeps onli 30%of wat he gets driving the cab on that day.But he has to fill the oil tank up to full no matter wat.So he may not make anything that day as there are just too many cabs and that will cause him to lose money instead of making it.I really feel sad for them.Who is to blame the government?I guess so.Why must i complain abt my life when others have it tougher.Well there's always a downside to the great side of life.I just hope that they will get a better life.

      Well i haven't blogged in like the last 4 to 5 days.Been kinda busy.Okiez lets see....Tuesday was great.Went to town to study.There great sights and sounds there.Studied for like 2 hours b4 catching Troy wif my cuz.Well the movie was great.It captured ur every imagination as u try to imagine wat the real thing was like.Tuesday was a blast really.Wednesday was spent pondering as to when the rain would stop so that me and the guys could start our soccer game.We decided to go at it in the rain.Well it was a really wet and fun game.The slippery surface didnt make it much easier to run.The games were played really well.I  was maybe a bit disappointed when a volley i hit when i was sliding across the ground was saved by the keeper.Then a powerful shot i hit didnt enter the goal but onli hit the guy's *u know wat*.Heheheh.That was really funny.Anyways it was great to be playing soccer wif the guys again.Just like in the old days when we really had much fun playing soccer everyday.As i type this blog im can only wonder when we'll play again.Okie so Thursday continued to be a good day as the last 2 had been.Went to town once more to catch the Punisher.Woah great show.It had a bit of comedy into the whole action movie.Wat a refreshing feeling to see that action movies can have a bit of funny moments.Well the movie was not that long but it does have a draggy and boring start.But as the action begins, it is once more interrupted by a boring part of the movie.But the fight scenes are damn cool.Went home to face a dilemma abt my pw.We have to kinda redo the whole proposal again.So Friday morning was spent doing pw in the library with my cool group members.We divided the work and decided that we can really pull the whole project off eventhough it seems difficult.Now in this Friday evening im entering my blog.Well i kinda decided that i would do a blog entry like once every 2 days.In that way i can get more stuff to write.This is my last blog entry b4 jetting of tml morning on my holiday.Yeahzzz.So i'll blog again wif my holiday experince when i return

      Phew...The weekend was so damn tiring.Never expected something like this.So lets see.Saturday seemed like it was going to be a bloody dull day.Woke up early to help in the preparations for my uncle's weeding on Sunday.Got there but did nothing much except to help carry stuff.Then i spent 3 hours eating and drinking trying to be merry as i tried to pass the extra time i had before attending fuhua's cultural nite.As usual we had out late-comers especially fitri.Do his hair lah.Man he made the whole group wait for him.So he arrived like 20 minutes late.We of course made him feel guilty.He was like using the starting time as his reason for being late.We got there and met our sec. school friends.Damn the convention hall was huge.We sat in the back.The first half of the concert was a bit dull.Then came the interval.I had a great laugh or laughs.We tried pasting the donation sticker on Fitri's back.We continued laughing throughout the interval as we tried over and over again to stick it.But with me being a considerate friend and gentleman i eventually asked the guys to stop.We had dinner wif the gals.This turned out into a nite where almost everything is a joke to us.The workers at LJS were like working double hard to keep up with the orders.Then the cashiers were like shouting at the ppl cooking the food.But i found it a bit rude for them to shout the orders so loud in front of the customers.As we got our food lek teng still did not get her food.After much persuasion Fitri finally agreed to get the food from the angry and frustrated cashiers.Fortunately for him as he was getting up,the food was being sent by the "nice" ppl of LJS.Hehehhe.We sat and talked for a while and had some more laughs before going off our separate ways.Sunday turned out to be an even more hectic day.I had to help out in ushering the ppl who attended the wedding.Then had to help pass out the goodies to the kids and adults.It was rathering boring and tiring.Then i left to attend azman's brother's wedding.It was so crowded with ppl.Met a former malay teacher of mine.This world is really getting smaller.So the guys and i talked for a while about organising a soccer game.We talked and talked and finally agreed  on the time and day.Then i had to get back to my uncle's wedding.Had to help out in the cleaning up which was damn boring.Went hope like 9 plus feeling tired.However, looking back on the weekend i found out that even though it was a tiring weekend but the company that i had more than made up up for teh fatigue.

      Well ppl...Lets see.I woke up bloody early today cos had hockey training.Well u can never be too early or late for hockey.Well Fitri was late when i thought i was the last one.Phew that was close.Ran and did some simple dribbling skills.Then during a demo some damn enthu guy slipped and fall.Well i shouldnt have laughed so muc.Gosh...that was rude.Okie.As usual there were many water breaks.Well we have to be hydrated.Then we played matches.Winner stays...loser goes home.I finally won my first match and also assisted Fitri with his first goal.Met wif the toughest team in the final match.Then it started to rain.But still we played on.Bragging rights were at stake.But we drew after a hard and close match.Well i sure was happy wif my team.FAATTimah was like pestering me to go to her Alumni band performance.So im thinking abt it.If i never go then she not happy but if i go i would feel awkward knowing that i dont know a soul from her sec. school except for a few ppl.Then came pw.Thought that everything was fine.Bad news was waiting.They told me that we misplaced the proposal and no one brought a new proposal form.We were like fried.So we opted to tell ms lum the truth.She didnt really scold except that she expected more from us.We were feeling guilty.So we stayed till like 1.30 doing pw.Brainstorming and planning.We were rather productive.Went back to fuhua to collect the o level cert.Then went to lunch wif fuzhi.Man he likes to act gay.hehehhe.Then we walked around and finally went home.Well im now in my comfy room typing this rather long blog to my standards.Chat wif a few interesting ppl just now.Had to answer so rather peculiar questions which were rather personal.But wat the hell they're are my frens.Well my bloody ankle still hurts after hockey.Well i guess thats all.Phew that was a lot of typing.

      Today has been a hell of a great day.Well not all the time.Econs was like so damn boring.Having to go thru the damn essays which was kind of a drag.The lecture was held in the hall cos of the chinese riddle thingy.Finally we are done with perfect competition after like 3 weeks.That was one hell of a long topic.Hehehe.PE was a breeze.I kinda got away wif running and onli had to stay in the gym to carry weights.For like 1 1/2 hrs.First time PE was this damn fun.Then i played badminton which of cos i won.Man, i need to scout the world for better opponents cos it was so easy to play against luis,fitri and daryl.The highlight of the day was playing the hockey match against commonwealth sec.Wah finally&nbsp; a worthy opponent for the J1 boys team cos we were like beating the gals flat all the time so this was like a fresh air for us.The day didnt look promising cos there were dark clouds at abt 3.30pm which worried the guys alot.We just hoped for the best.We went there by cab cos we were goin to be late.Josh,Jie Feng and Xing Liang went together while i shared a cab wif the gals from my class.And being the gentleman i had to pay but i had no qualms abt that.We went up the slope to be introduced to this damn good looking hockey astroturf field.Man the turf was like so damn green and soft.I was overawed by the place its surroundings were so tranquil and quiet and the atmosphere was really nice.We changed and look anxiously at the commonwealth team train.Then the seniors came and we got the tactics rite.The selection was made and i was left out to play in the 2nd half cos there was apparently too many forwards in the seniors team.The team was under attack by the commonwealth team form the very start.They didnt seem to get the flow rite.Their attacks were quickly broken down by the sec school kids.HOW COULD THIS BE?The last few moments of the 1st half were very tense.The barrage of attacks seem to be too overwhelming for the JJCians.Finally the whistle was blown.The half was over.Then when the 2nd half team was being decided i realised that there were 3 Imrans at the field.That was interesting.I was assigned my fav. role that is forward.Wah im playing finally.The game's restart was not that very encouraging.We were under attack again.But then the tides changed.We were attacking.Yes i got the ball dribbled past 1 defender then tried to get it to my left winger but the ball was intercepted.Damn wat a waste.Then we attacked again wif harun running down the right flank im running to the center to deflect the ball but he was chased down by too many defenders and the ball goes out.A free hit was shot directly into the net but it was outside the semi circle if only i touched the ball.We continued our attacks but they came up to be nothing much as we ended the game in a draw.But it was a&nbsp;really nice experience to play in a real match situation.Until my next match which can occur very soon, im happy wif my performance.The only thing left to do is to score a goal.

      Well im blogging frequently again cos i got the time to do so.Well the week started out ok except for the fact that the whole class got scolded for not doing our geog reading.That was one hell of a scary moment...Then there was PW and im proud to say that the group has tried to catch up.We have done our best to do our survey in 1 week which is a record.Enough of school...Well lets tok about my favourite topic at the moment HOCKEY.Well the team has been working hard lately or most of the time.The boys are full of confidence after really great training sessions.It seems like we are bonding and gelling at the rite moment when we have to sort out matters wif some of our skills and ball control.Today we trained at Delta stadium in preparation for this Friday's match.The much anticipated match of the boys team.Well we can basically see if we are really good or just plain lousy.The team does have problems defensively but in attack we can be damn deadly.We have like a compact and hardworking midfield that supports forwards like me to the end.Im just looking forward to the match and hoping for the best.thats all until next time

      Well here i am again after a long absence from blogging...Phew its been a rough week.Monday started out fine.I was more or less happy to be back in school.The PW questionnaire was finally approved and we have the minor details in the proposal ironed out.Econs tutorial is beginning to become more exciting as i begin to get a hang of it after one term.Well the highlight of Monday is of course hockey training.It went great until i accidentally went to low to sweep the ball and had a chunk of flesh on my middle finger off.That hurt really.What a way to learn never to bend too low.Well i went home late that nite at 9pm.Then had to see the doc cos i was a bit under the weather.Slept like a baby that nite.Tuesday i skipped PE and also my gp lecture.Gp is like so boring and i thought that it was interesting.Had hockey on Wednesday again.But b4 that i had to go to the CCA leaders meeting.Well we learnt when we were to have our investiture and had to memorise our pledge.Standing in the sun wasnt really tat fun.Hockey was really tiring.We had PT for the first time in like ever.And it was evident that we were not fit ppl.Hahaha.Scored a few wonderful goals again eg. i scored a goal by tapping the cross under my leg.Wat a beauty.Hehehe.Fortunately i didnt go to school on Thursday.Had MC.Got to watch the brazil-uruguay match that was a entertaining.The rest of the day was spent watching tv and playing games.there was no studying.Friday was like a 3 lesson day.I skipped Pe again.Attended onli the econs lecture and tutorial and the malay lesson.Went home wif a good fren that day and also forgot my water bottle.That threw me into a frenzy.I called up some ppl to help get the bottle for me.And Febrin did.Met him on saturday to collect the bottle.Phew and i thought that my bottle was goin to spend the weekend in school.Hahaha.That was close.Well i guess thats all for know.

      Hahaha...Its been like ages since i posted my last blog.Well i have lots to tell then.Okie where do i begin?Lets see...I have recently got my own hockey stick.Yeah.Finally a stick to call my own.Its ok not that fancy but still very practical.But the stick has been taking a beating.The head is like losing its paint work fast.Wat a heartbreaking sight.My beautiful stick made its debut in the inter house hockey competition.But wat a lousy experience it was.I had to lead a team wif a few ppl who have not even played hockey.I had to do a demo to them so that they know the right way to hit.But as usually my young shoulders had to carry the burden of the whole team.I was so exhausted after the first game losing like 4-2.But i scored both goals.Not bad for a start.The next match was a walkover as the dumb Bikila team went home.the final and most important match was a disaster losing 4-0.So embarassing.I guess that without the usual team mates the support me in training,i am more or less incapable as they cant expect a forward to run all over picking up lose balls, defending and scoring at the same time.That was wat i had todo if Bannister were to have a slim chance of making it thru to the next round.But im only human.After hockey,I had to play in the soccer team too.Playing as a winger was going to be difficult judging from past experience.the team drew 1-1 at full time.I was first to take the penalty kick.I kicked straight when i actually intended to hit the bottom right hand corner.Im blamed for losing the match.But wat the heck the rest also missed.So i returned to school the next day facing a barrage of critics.Wat an experience.Being blamed for the lost.Hahaha.Just like Beckham.Life has been a bit of a rush lately.Having to settle my PW and hwk.Pw's going smoothly now.But still needs a bit of work.Recently its been a very confusing time for me.Having to make difficult decisions in school.But all is well now that i've settled the problem.Haiz...I actually got lots to write  but cant seem to get remember wat they are.So i guess this is all.I'll try to update my blog as often as possible.

      Well its been a hell of a week.Singpaore today has sworn in its new PM....Man im going miss PM Goh.He's been a great leader.Well this blog isn't suppose to have political stuff so i will stop here.Well i really have enjoyed this week.There have been some very memorable events this week.Apart from me passing my econs test and completing all my history essays.Well its a bit of a private matter.Which i would most likely not tok here.Hahah.Yesterday, i went to TJC for a history seminar.Wat an experience.We were like running late.Wah i paniced.The school was old but they have renovated it to give it a much more modern look.Especially their canteen which looks more like a cafe.Their auditorium is like woah.Cool.Super cool.Its facade is like so modern so stylish.The interior is much better than JJ's LT 5.Their seats are nice.But the inside is damn stylo.Gerek man.Hahahha.Wah enough of Tj.After the seminar i met up wif my cuz who was studying there and had dinner together wif a couple of my frens.We toked and there was a bit of surprises peppered thru out the whole dinner.So i went home wif two of my cousins and my class mate.Thru out the journey home we were like rediculing ppl in the train.Wah that was mean of all of us.There was some guy who had like this damn big shoe.It was like size 13.But the guy is like so small.We were like laughing at him.Then it did feel kinda bad and rude.But we're onli kids rite.I think this is all.Its like so short.Kinda ran out of time.Maybe next time.Heheheh

      Well i finally get the chance to blog again after wat has turned out to be a hell of a hectic week.I am enjoying my life in school.I love my cca and sumthing else.Well the week started out great as monday saw geog lecture and tutorial being cancelled as ms lum didnt come school.Then pw was so great as we did nothing but sit there and chatted away as there was no teacher.But the bad part of the day came when we had to do our econs test.Hahaha.Again econs pls i like it but i was not fully prepared for this test.However, have no despair as all the students in class passed their mcq so there's a high chance for a 100% passing rate for A4.Yeah!!!!Tuesday was a bummer.Gp lecture was so damn boring.Wat the hell is gp for when all it does is waste our time and energy.Wah this blog is supposed to be a happy one and i should not put in any unhappy times in my week.But this week has been memorable.Wednesday hockey was upon me.But b4 that could happen i had to attend the cca leader rehersal.It was a really bad experience.Mr Handsome Ng scolded all the leaders for not projecting enough zest and energy.He shouted as we sang the national songs too soft and the whole session dragged for another hour.Then in hockey as the whole team ran like 13 rounds around the track i did only 1 as time was running out.The first game i played was abit of a bummer as i scored only 1 goal.I was thinking to myself if that was going to be my only goal.But when the 2nd game came heheheh i tore up the defence of the girls team by slotting in 4 goals and setting up 1.Wat a way to make an impact and end the day.I just hope that my great scoring run continues after our break in training.Thursday was one long day that ended at 7pm.The class and I had to attend an extra 1 1/2hrs of econs tutorial.Wat a pain.Finally the great day had arrived FRIDAY.I simply love this day for this week only.This was the day when as i quote hensem ng"this friday is your day to gain the respect of the whole school as you take the pledge to become cca leaders".Wat a cool day it was.Reported in school at 7 am for 1 last rehersal.This was the day.I was all hyper and very excited.They ceremony started and there i was standing in front of the whole school proudly as i represented my cca.The event was over in like 40 mins.That was quite short.Then we went for a short briefing to be told to lead the house in the singing of national songs.Well that was my first official assignment.Hhahaha.Then the soccer game started between the once mighty team JJ against the CD 4th battalion.Well the first half ended a boring 0-0.But in the 2nd half JJ scored the only goal that proved to be the match winner.I then attended the debriefing for the whole day as mr ng said that we have done a good job on our first official day.Then we received our certs and badges.Then i went for an outing that was beyond wat i ever thought it would be.My friend and i went for lunch at pizza hut.It actually happened as i lost a bet to her.Hahhaha its more like giving in so being the gentleman that i am i bought her lunch.Well we had a rather slow lunch that lasted for like 2 hrs.Boy that was a record.Then we decided to go for a walk b4 going home.As we walked we met like so many ppl that knew us.Then i was really panicing abt wat would happen the following week.That was one hell of a scare for us.As we were on the way home,we decided to go to orchard and walk.We went there, walked about talking abt stuff and more stuffs.Well i guess thats all for today as i end my very interesting and fun day on a high
