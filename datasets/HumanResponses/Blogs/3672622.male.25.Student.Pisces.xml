      I started writing these things as a way to vent some feelings and it is working out fairly well.  This Maria girl is killing me, but only in my brain.  I assume she has no feelings other than friendship feelings towards me, but I am having a hard time getting through to my heart to let him know.  I have been trying my damnedest to not call her, so the lesson is when you have feelings just ignore them.  It hurts to ignore something that feels right in your heart, but what are you supposed to do.  Keep being around a person and put your heart through rigorous torture. I'll pass, I can't handle this heartbreak.  Off that subject, my grandmother is in the hospital because she is having vertigo attacks.  She loses her balance and then is pretty much paralyzed from the loss of balance.  I write her a letter every week and I have since I have been in college, because I know she gets lonely in Dallas by herself.  She has a shrine of me on her walls.  I used to go home with her after school every other day when my mom had to go back to work.  I learned to cook and she told me stories after stories.  I love my grandmother, but she won't be here until the end of time.  Life hurts, always.

      Normal is the worst word in the human vocabulary.  I am tired of feeling stagnate, always waking up to the scenery hurts the soul of a young college student.  I am tired of belly aching over this particular theme, but it is on the top of the mind throughout the day.  Had a physics test today, it went well I suppose.  Enough of the scholastic talk!  I still have a crush on that same girl, but I don't believe she returns the same feelings.  I am getting used to the disappointment around here.  So depressing, but I am still sane and my jeans are dry today.  Life is never too bad, Well at least I have my books.  Well I guess this is good-bye.  Don't forget that casserole dish you let me borrow.  That squash casserole recipe  you gave me was to die for.  You are such a peach.  Well check ya later.

      I have done nothing today and it was everything I hoped it would be.  Life has thrown me some curve balls lately and I am unable to mask it like the usual.  I feel like I am doing the things in life right, but the answer I get is not the one everyone else got.  What are you going to do?    Went running this morning, I felt like the kid with asthma that had to walk while everyone ran.  Where did he get that damn doctor's note?  I assume that to be successful in Medical School I will need to be in good shape as well.  Is all this responsibility worth it?  I just get tired of making more and more sacrifices and others seem to remain the same.  I guess this is growing up?  Sometimes I wonder where my place in the world is?  Who are my friends there?  Or is feeling misunderstood just part of life you have to tolerate?  I want change, but change is will only slow down my path to becoming what I want to do in life.  Where are Simon and Garfunkel now, and bob dylan, or Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  I want a reason to do nothing.    I have seen footage of a South Korean man being held in the hands of Al-Quaeda Rebels, they are probably going to behead him as they have already done with two American cities.  This world is becoming crazy, there has been violence before, but humanity has up and left the room.  Poor men that have nothing to do with the their cause, but have families.  Tragic???  still like that girl, but the magic 8 ball says outlook not so good.

      Well today was another fun-filled day in the life of working student.  It started with a healthy dosage of Physics at 8 am in the morning and ended with an 8 hour shift at the hospital.  This place is so desolate, and it is beginning to tear away on my soul.  I am tired of no trees and no elevation changes, too much sky makes it to easy to drift off and dream of a far off place where you can be the person you want to be.  I feel like I have all this responsibility and nothing to show for it, but time and patience will take care of that.  I wish I could utter the words, I am tired of life here, lets take a holiday in Spain.  I have had a hard time nudging Maria out of my brain.  She has such a personal side to her, willing to display her vulnerability to anyone with no reservation.  I wish I could let people know the real me, the one has his feelings hurt when friends let me down.  I wish people knew how much I genuinely care for them, but some things are better said through actions.  I don't believe she shares the same feelings as I have for her.  She has so many boys knocking down her door, I may have personality but that can only carry you so far.  Enough of this  There was a baby at the hospital today that weighed only two pounds and was carried for 9 months.  She was just tiny, but I looked as her eyes struggled to open from time to time.  I am reminded of what really makes everyday life beautiful.  Not materials, not where you live, or if you are doing great in life.  It is the common bond we all share, we are human beings that exist to help others to accomplish life. We all exist to give a ride in a bus, check out your groceries, pick up the trash, nurse back to health, Whatever the case may be, my rambling has no point other than I love to see people live their lives.   Damn the man, save the empire

      Time to vent I suppose:  Life brings trials and tribulations that test the character of human beings, but why do we have to endure so many tests.  Talking about love through these medium is probably overkill to the avid reader.  However, love is the drive of someone's life and all the world revolves around their love or lack there of.  Which brings me to what may cause an aneurysm later on in life.  A little background: I am a nice guy, some assholes claim this title and are unable to back it up, hence the common quote, "He was so nice at first", anyway I was the friend that every girl claimed they wanted to marry, eventually.  Now that I am attending a four year university, I truly believed being the nice guy would begin paying off by Kharma's standards alone.  I have had girlfriends, all of which I have settled for.  Not that they weren't nice girls or pretty, but I am a helpless romantic that has a vision of who I want.  Not by the characteristics of blonde, tall, tan, or things of that nature.  I want a girl that thinks for herself and has ambitions in life.  I want the girl that will go play in the rain, lay in bed all day and talk even though the sun is shining, likes herself the way she is(little if no make-up and never even considered plastic surgery), loves the beauty of nature and is ok with no TV.  I could go on, but I thought I found the girl.(Keyword:thought)  She was my best friend and the one I confided in the most.  I confused the friendship we had with deeper feelings on account of the love you have for a best friend.  I was ready to give up on the girls in this region of the world, until an interest popped up in an unexpected place.  She was an ex-girlfriend's little sister in her sorority(normally don't like the breed but there are exceptions to every rule).  We will call her Maria, and I am not so bold to say I am in love or even in that state of mind, but I enjoy getting know everything about her.  She is real to herself at all times in any company, which is unfortunately all to rare now days.  Her ability to care for others is almost overwhelming, and leaves you breathless at times.  She thinks no one understands her.  My new name shall be "NO ONE", for I am the friend that takes care of all, offering myself and all that I have to anyone who asks.  This is the most fulfilling way of life to me, but it has its burns that come with it.  There is the taking advantage angle, but I am getting more from helping them than they are from me.  Its when the few days out of the year that you shed optimism and have the shitty days.  Where is everyone?  I could use someone to vent to. Guys, where are you?   No need to be bitter, but it hurts the heart, which is what guides me through life.  I like this Maria, she is special, unique in spirit and is all to beautiful(definition: pretty, funny, intelligent, outgoing), you know BEAUTIFUL.  That word is used all too much and most don't deserve it.  I don't care if anything comes from it, it would be nice.  She is one of the people you meet on your path in life and are a better person because of them.  I said it, she makes me want to be a better person.   This was all too long but it's my first time.  Well Check Ya Later!
