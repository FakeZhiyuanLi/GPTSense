      Yay! Finally Harry Potter is a have seen instead of a must see!! Even got Dh to start reading the book.. wonder if he will end up loving them like I do (though in a very manly way of course..lol) We left lil mama for the first time today with the "sitters" AKA Grammy and Opi. She seemed no worse for the wear afterwords, and I was actually okay too.. though I had to ask DH and Sistie not to mention it for fear that I might start leaking from the eyes and other places as well.... ahh the joys of nursing!! Of course DH forgets to ask me to do Laundry until he's down to his last pair of socks and at 10:00 at night.. AGAIN! so nearly 12 AM and Im waitin for the familiar buzz of the dryer since the clothes were still wet the first time... strange... but not uncommon... ahh there goes the dryer...

      up till 3am.. adventures in siggy making.. still not sittin still!! Belated fathers day at Grammy & Opi's.. great dinner and interesting conversation as the truth of my adoption finally came to light (most of what I had already suspected). Grammy spoiled the girls as usual with great new Grammy-specialty outfits including the cutest outfit and bonnet for lil mama.. very Anne Geddes in that it makes her look like a little green flower.. have to get a picture of it..hoping to see Harry Potter tomorrow at last.. The baby was ill opening weekend and what with one thing or another, we havent been able to see it yet...so tomorrow I finally get to go to the first movie since Finding Nemo.

      So tonight we started "Little house in the big woods"... (Note to self, next time re-read childhood favorites before introducing them to nearly 6 yo to check for such contents as hog butchering and making of headcheese.. that raised too many questions!!)Needless to say, "sistie" is awaiting Chapter 2 with a mix curiosity and dread. What is that Music coming through the moniter??? Some nights its violin, and tonight its Piano.. at first we thought it to be a practicing efficianado, but the introduction of the piano leads me to think that the moniter is picking up a stereo somewhere in the complex.. ahh well, at least if the baby is hearing it, its better than screaming fans from the baseball field next door!!

      well the birthday bash for sistie is over.. it was such a long day... the cake turned out allright but it was alot of work.. especially the starburst fish! But the end result was gratifying and sweet :) It was great to see all the family&nbsp; together in one place with friends as well. our families are so rarely in one place at one time. We are officially exhausted now though, all are sleeping tightly except for me (of course). Cant give enough thanks to my folks for helping to pull it off, even with the forgotten 3 lbs of macaroni salad and napkins. Sistie made out like a bandit with new toys and new clothes galore and lil mama was fantastic despite the fact that her dinner was an hour late and she hardly got any "mommy time" all day. &nbsp;Carpet guy is coming tomorrow and this place looks like a tornado hit it and I just remembered that the carpet guy is coming tomorrow in themorning.. so it looks like there is no rest for the wicked.. or the party hostesses either!

      ...found the mysterious source of the violin music, and it is in fact a neighbor who has the understated non-courtesy to practice in the yard as opposed to in the house like normal people... I realize the milder evenings have brought people out of doors, but does the neighbor really think evening concerts are in order??   The birthday cake appears that it will be comparitavely easy (whoops, just jinxed myself). The fish and such made of starburst that will adorn the cake are fairly easy to make and even funner to eat (ya know, had to take a couple of practice swings before the big game). I'll be spending the week making seashell and starfish candy to compliment the theme (one mold, lots to make). Sisties gifts were a walk in the park to purchase except for the camera as the place I went to didnt carry the type of camera I was looking for... oh well, I got it cheaper and it came with a battery and film!

      wow.. what a long week... but first let it be said that DIAL UP STINKS!!! Im back to it after long dsl use for various reasons... okay... quick recap.. 4th was fine.. long trip to Mammoth and long trip back.. but the girls were good.... Lil mama is officially up on her knees and scooting backwards!!... she keeps rocking (I think she is hoping that the momentum will push her forwards) but no luck yet. She is also saying mama.. ALOT!!! especially when she is fussy and its not mamamama... its just plain mama..woohooo score one for me!! got it out of her before Dada!!! Plans for sisties 6th birthday are up and running... have to start gathering cake ingredients this week. and what a wild cake it will be!! Finally got in a night of scrapbooking ( after a day of coffee and swimming) without the girls thanks to Shannan... nice to have someone to work with again!! and she introduced me to other new friends so we can all scrap together... finally got Kaelyn's 5th birthday done in her Disneyland book and stuck a couple more pages into her autograph book too..... YAY ME!! it was a productive evening!

      So Ive spent the last couple of nights making handmade invitations for "sistie's" birthday party.. its been repetative, mundane work, but more creative than storebought. Starting to pull all the details together now the where ad when of it... just have to get to the finer details now,, should I serve dinner?? or just a light repast not to mention that I need tos tart getting things together for the cake which will be  FUN!!.... Now onto "lil mama"... she rolled right off the bed again yesterday.... good thing that there was a pile of clothes on the floor waiting for its turn in the washer right where she fell....She's really starting to become mobile now... scooting all over the place... Im almost scared of her starting to crawl!!!

       what a long 2 weeks of teething... lil mama broke two teeth and shes goin through a mama phase whenever I have things to do, the only time that she doesnt pitch a fit when I walk away is when I drop her off at daycare. Go figure!

      its been a busy couple of weeks with my time at work increasing and all... and how fast the baby has developed over the past few weeks.. she is so close to actual hands and knees crawling that my heart leaps into my mouth everytime she gets up on her hands and knees. She is also pulling up making things more perilous and increasing the need for more effective babyproofing around the house...
