      So i am getting ready for this trip and listening to old soul records. I am aging rapidly. Maybe too rapidly. it feels like I am having one of thos Lite FM moments.. or one of those Starbucks compilation CD moments. I am both flabergasted and amused by the fact that there is a soundtrack to ordering coffee and you can buy it at the register... and also that it CHANGES. Today there is a Rock one, then tomorrow there will be "Love Song Classics" or some other nonsense. Thank you Starbucks.   Rare 1960's soul will always be my bread and butter though. I have a section of compilation LPs in my record collection that is probably 17"es wide or so. That is a ton of 2-3 minute tracks. Now I am sounding like  urlLink Nick Hornby .  Realize I only  link some of this stuff so that this blog has blog-like qualities. I am still failing at learning how to spice this thing up.. This may be why noone is reading or commenting. Fair enough.   So my band played in NYC a little bit ago and someone I went to high school with was at the show with his little brother. This is so extremely weird, I don't even know where to begin. This classmate of mine ran with a totally different crowd and while I was walking around school with a skateboard, impossibly large pants and a  urlLink Snapcase  long-sleeve, he was friendly with the more jock/frat-ish kids that were friendly enough, but that I had nothing in common with. His 15 year old brother has gotten him into music and takes him to shows. So weird. I suppose you never know who is listening or reading or watching. Let this be a lesson to you.

      If anyone cares to bet how long it will take for "Winter Love" to appear on the soundtrack to a  urlLink Wes Anderson  film, get in touch.    Sung Tongs  is a brilliant album and "Winter Love" is easily the stand out with its trademarked quirky melodic vocal arrangements that are nothing short of beautiful. One of the few new-ish songs I have heard that gives me chills in some parts.  Anyways, the song itself screams  Bottle Rocket , or just should have been written for  Rushmore . Perfect.

      Yesterday was a conveniently typical day in the shop.. convenient for illustrating how annoying it is to work here sometimes.   First a middle aged man comes in and wants a shitty flash-piece of a knife going through a heart on his leg. He was the ONLY walk-in of the day. One of our artists agrees to it, the guy pays upfront and the artist goes to set up. In the meantime,  my coworker collects the guy's photo ID and has him fill out our release form. After doing so, he looks antsy, waits around another two minutes and then hastily tells me that the artist is taking too long to set up. It has been 5 minutes. So he demands his money back and leaves. My theory is that he got cold feet and didn't want to tell us that. In hindsight, maybe we should have forced him to get the tattoo or at least kept his money. That particular artist has not had work to do in weeks and he will starve to death soon.   We also run a supply distribution thingy here, so we get all sorts of degenerates who think theyre tattoo artists coming in for needles, tubes, ink and the like. Some are super sketchy, but we sell them shit anyway. Great. In any event, this guy comes in (note: he is from a NJ shop called HOLY COST. you may want to avoid that place after reading this). He actually asks me if forceps used for piercing need to be sterilized. uhhhhhhhhh. So there you go. I hope my boss/the owner is proud that these are the kind of people we are helping to keep IN business rather than try to put out of business.   While all this happens during the day, my band is also in the process of booking a US tour to commence this fall. There is no better way to learn how irritating it is to have to depend on other people than to attempt to book a tour. For those of you who still trust others to work as hard as you are, this is a perfect way to re-evaluate your beliefs.  Aside from these minor drawbacks, life couldn't be better. I am single, preparing to leave for a nice extended vacation Friday afternoon and there is still at least 7 weeks of summer left. Believe me. I am not as cynical as you already believe.

      Once, I thought that a virtual diary would give me incentive to keep up with my writing. Let's face it. I am lazy. A music site sent me 4 records to review and I have only done two of them in about a month. Ironically, I am writing here and listening to  Blood on the Tracks  instead of listening to bad indie pop and waxing critical about it. Regardless, things happen and they need to be told. Records are around for a long time, and noone listens to reviews anyway.  A female friend of mine had been dating the same person for 6-7 years before they split up this past April.  He is around 30. She is around 24. Though she is a knockout, I have always sort of viewed this girl as "one of the guys", and I think that burden is weighing down on her newly single self. Now, I am not refering to *me* specifically, but the fact that most of the guys she finds worthwhile also feel this way.   "A" (I am actually frightened that mutual friends will stumble here.. forgive my paranoia) was always the girl who was able to hang with guys and was eerily perceptive in the ways of "guy talk" and so on and so forth; the perfect honorary bro, so to speak.  Conversely, between the ages of maybe 16 and 23 people always assumed I was gay. I was always the guy who was able to hang with the gals and was (so I'm told) eerily perceptive in the ways of "girl talk" and female-centric stuff.. within reason, of course. A female high school classmate (who later came out of the closet and told me about her girlfriend) told me that I was more of a girl than she was. Maybe. I guess it's all in what you know..Having mostly been raised by my mother and grandmother, I knew more womanly things and was taught chivalry and other outmoded gentlemanly practices at a very young age. I have actually used some of these things that I was taught and the reactions have ranged from genuinely charmed to compeltely puzzled. Most of the time it was the latter. So much for good breeding.  In any event, I wish my honorary bro (or am I the honorary sis..?) all the luck in the world and hope she stays happy and continutes to be able to hang with the fellas while she hangs with the fellas in other ways.   Finally some random notes about me.. I work in a tattoo shop, so expect stories about the really poor judgment of strangers and just how dirty and incompetent tattooers really are here in NY. I also play in an active touring band that I will not name (at least right now), so expect stories about going nowhere in nowhere towns and doing my best to meet interesting people there. Hopefully this blog will amount to something vaguely interesting, and hopefully some of you will provide all the insight im missing. Goodnight for now.

      Quebec is a really nice city... The air is chill even when it is summer and it is clean.  Getting over the border was stressful.. Immigration searched our van and found a box of CDs and a bag of like 8 shirts and told me we would be taxed for them, but I talked our way out of being charged. Thankfully. Meanwhile, our working papers were completely inaccurate. Some of what was wrong: one band member not listed on the permit, my date of birth was wrong, and the place where we were listed as going to cross the border was wrong.. Good start.   Otherwise, traveling through Quebec was relaxing. The show was OK, but not so great as it was apparently barely promoted. I don`t understand the idea of taking the time to book and put on a show and then not caring about ptomoting it. Today we are due to play a house in Toronto (9 hours west). However, we can`t afford to get there because the booking agent also neglected to tell us that we would have to pay a $450CAN immigration fee just to get over the border. Great to work with others, let me tell you. Also I am not even going to get into telling you about how all of our t--shirts that we need to sell are waiting in a warehouse in NY state because they did not make it over the border. We have to get those on Monday. A disaster and it has only been one full day.
