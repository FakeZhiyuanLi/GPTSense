       Life just sucks. I've been banned from humanity. Er..perhaps i should rephrase that..I've been banned from the PC and im actually online illegally. * shhh * The reason for this was a really stupid incident involving stupid people. Thanks to them i've resorted to self mutilation and some prayers and im all done now. Yes yes call me psycho. Anyway, today i made the best fish and chips ever. Yummy i cant wait to make it again someday. The hot and cripsy yet tantalizing skin of the white fresh flesh is truly delicious somehow. Fish and chips has gotten into my heart. Oh yeah orang utan's too. I hope they remain foreva! oo...i better get going before i get caught! cyah coconuts and asses!

       After that gruelling session of badminton...I am feeling the after effects. I have aches all over now and its starting to wreck my mood a little bit. Nevertheless, i had to wake up early and attend sunday school ( talk about being holy ) then church ( talk about being holier ) then back home. The afternoon nap was also wrecked thanks to mr. Sun's stupid heat that is causing me to feel extremely warm even though the aircond is switched on ( perhaps the repairman should come ) and the fan is at its highest speed. And now here i am sitting at the pc...very BORED in fact...eating a bowl of tofu and soy juice. Its kinda refreshing. Thats the only nice thing that happened to me today. Life is dull heh' :P Oh yeah! i got a new obsesssion...ORANG UTAN'S! those oogly googly cute eyes and those made up faces ( talk about stone age make up *charcoal* ) and those big mouths and cute hairy hairs. Really they're kinda cute. If only i was an orang utan. Goodbye!      - blog ends here -

       Today is probably the hectic-est day of my life. After a gruelling session of badminton i cycled my way back to my house with a headache and i now have a whole body ache. I hate it when this happens! Anyway badminton's cool. The Olympics is kinda boring. The stadium is empty and everyone seem to have died or something o.O Life kinda rock-ed today. And i have clean nose after a tough session washing it..my nose can now be declared black head free. Ta Da! dang im bored...      Goodbye!      - blog ends here -
