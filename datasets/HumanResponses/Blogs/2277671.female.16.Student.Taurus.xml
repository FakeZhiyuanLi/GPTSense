      Had to write a paper for AVID... like a descriptive essay, and i had a sort of bad night ...   THANK YOU CRISTINA, IM SORRY I WOKE YOU UP... YOU MADE ME HAPPY YOU ARE THE BESTEST EVER!!      So here is the essay I wrote.... chaa.....   Dark and Hazy   	  A place where no one can go, and where no one can see. Dark, and hazy, it is a part of me. Thoughts racing, hurt and confusion, full of tension and no relaxation.  	In my dreams, a haven, colors, pretty pictures, good thoughts and happy times. Sometimes it makes me smile, and sometimes cry, a place to go, it is always there, guiding me toward wrong and right, always putting up a fight. In a state of euphoria, I am happy, nothing can bother me. Sad, crazy and funny thoughts. Images of little, big and scary people.  It is full of ideas of the future, memories of the past and warm feelings of the present.  	It holds my inner darkest secrets and does not tell a soul, except for my own. When I am down, this place can either keep me down or lift me up. Through good and bad, it will be there, as if it were a hand to hold, warm and soft, or hard and cold, depending on the mood. 	Sandy beaches with splashing water and pretty sunsets with  different colors, purples, pinks and different shades of blue. A dark dungeon with long dim lighted chandeliers and spikes coming from the walls, giving off a Closter phobic feeling. Suffocating and paralyzing every part of your body, giving you watery eyes, and bloody tears.  	It can bring smiles of happiness and tears of sadness. Not caring how you feel, good or bad, it controls your emotions. It changes your mood and attitude without notice. Others do not  know how this is for me, but they know what I am talking about. That one place that is always there, a place to get away, or a place to be trapped. Where no one can bother you.  It can be your best friend, or you worst enemy. At times, it can be a cruel place that gives you negative thoughts and leads you to a bad emotional state.               Lately, this place has served as a personal prison for me; it is not helping me sort out any of my problems. It is dark and cloudy, full of teary rain puddles. There is no escaping this place, for only it can change itself and set me free.       M Success comes easily to you.    O You are very open-minded on your mind.    N You like to work, but you always want a break.   I You are always smiling & making others smile.   C You definitely have a partier side in you,  dont be shy to show it.    A You can be very quiet when you have something  on your mind.     A You can be very quiet when you have something  on your mind.  B You are always cautious when it comes to  meeting new people.  C You definitely have a partier side in you,  dont be shy to show it.  D You have trouble trusting people.  E You are a very exciting person. F Everyone loves you.  G You have excellent ways of viewing people.  H You are not judgemental.  I You are always smiling & making others smile.  J Jealousy.  K You like to try new things.  L Love is something you deeply believe in.  M Success comes easily to you.  N You like to work, but you always want a break.  O You are very open-minded.  P You are very friendly and understanding.  Q You are a hypocrite.  R You are a social butterfly.  S You are very broad-minded.  T You have an attitude, a big one.  U You feel like you have to equal up to people's  standards.  V You have a very good physical and looks.  W You like your privacy .  X You never let people tell you what to do .  Y You cause a lot of trouble.  Z You're always fighting with someone

           its sad how innocent people die, and they are people you just know, and are used to hearing about, and for most people seing. my thoughts go out to those who go to aaroyo and the families of Lindsey Currey, Thuan Ho, and now Matt Sarmiento [aka Guam] and his cousin Angel... who burned alive early yesterday morning in their home.      chaa manny wrote in my blog     God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.

       Listening to... Lyric.. Hot n Tipsy.... "  first of all, had be on some freak shit... mustve been what i was drinkin...alize had me thinkin; its the weekend so its ok ... i like the way u ballin got my body callin .... "  Well well well... here i am again. Bout to tell you all how i feel.. haha who reads this anyways? Arrite i wouldnt say im 'trippin' like usual today but iono i was talkin to somebody last night and they said some stuff ya know that got me thinkin iono what to do ahHhhhhH... ima juss wait n see what happens.. so anyways... I watched Scarface yesterday i was so happy i had been wanting to watch it...my mom was all trippin kuhz he said 'yayo' haha... sO0 im talkin 2 this girl right now that wanna see wsup wid me shes hella co0 but u know.. i don exactly swing dat way ... hahA... but yehhH... DaMmn i have only done ONE thing this whole break.. i went to the 'movies' last night. even tho they stopped selling tickets at 10:30 ... damn retarded a$$ tooK hella days to come pick me up... err  i hate waiting ... im an impatient person... thas kinda bad.. i guess? well deal wid it..  I tried 2 sleep but i couldnt... it was hella bad... like i felt so tired but i went in my room to take a nap and i just couldnt fall asleep.. and den i ate dinner... n i did sumthin i havent done in hella long... iono whas wrong wid me.. I was going through old emails and found this that my old buddy ricky sent me   Have you ever wondered which hurts the most? Saying something and wishing you hadn't? or saying nothing and wishing you had? I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say. Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them. If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs. Have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person? Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own....when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to. Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all. Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger. Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had. * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye? *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there? *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore)*What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them? *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?* People live, but people die.  And I want to tell you that you are a friend. If you died tomorrow , you would be in my heart!!! Would I be in yours? If you care about me as much as I care about you, you will send this back. You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next, and don't want to talk at all the year after that. So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,look up to you, respect you, and truly cherish you. Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you if you consider them a friend as well. Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will. Remember, everyone needs a friend,

      I've been cleaning out my room, and under my bed, I have a box full of letters and things that I've kept [ for memories, i guess..] Well I was going through it and I found this little book, Its not mine... but I have it... And theres lots of things in there that someone [ who will remain anonymous] wrote, or got from somewhere and she talks  about these 'ideas'.. haha on the first page it says .." I write like a poet when I'm high" So thats what I'm gonna call it.. here are a few things that made me laugh/think....    Gilligans Island:  "The Gilligans Island script is written by genious kids in Russia. A porn w/ the sex parts cut out."  "I was smoking and Boy Meets World was on and in a black woman tone I was all " Oh I thought I was watching Friends" Get it, cause Boy Meets World was on..."   Ricky Lake:  "Ricky Lake makes a show, they use prisoners and change the outfits and Ricky is a fat insecure fat girl..."  "You've got two different people in life. You've got the young, funny ones who are being told by the older hard working ones that life doesn't come easy and you've got to work hard for what you want. Then you've got it vise-versa ( or twisted) and the older funnies who are telling the young hard workers to have fun in life cause it aint all about work work work , you gotta have some fun in life and they are all like " Which road are you gonna take? What kind of person are you?" And I'm just like who gives a fuck, i'm not just gonna listen to that, i'm gonna do whatever is now, fuck tomorrow, it can wait. I'll make my desicions for tomorrow, tomorrow, cause today I might die. Fuck the plans. I'm doing whats here and whats now. You can say whatever you want but whos gonna care in 1 week and will that save your life?"   The Devil:  " Hell wants to show you when you should do bad things b/c he is trying to recuit  people that are going to hell. And then there is angels sent from heaven and when good things happen that makes another person motivated to do more good stuff and that's how the good in the world turns . Because it's a fight for good (heaven) and evil (hell) and for a long time good has won and it reigns over the earth cause they go to different planets and control aliens on it ( we are the aliens) It's like a sims game."   Sac Town:  "See now i'm Ol' Sac-Town and here we breakin 'em down. Sometimes we smile, somtimes we frown, you know how it be and some say we get around but most of all you know we been gettin down come n see its the place to be. Can we get it? But all i can say is i'm wit it and how that i'm here we can get it. We role up a blunt, STL will hit it once Its all in a day but tomorrow we'll forget it. We didnt get it today, thats all that we'll do in 1 day but we'll never get it so get over yesterday... " (  We role up a blunt, STL will hit it once...   She was talking about me... I used to be STL.."  one hit n quit bitch "... haha good times. )  I blacked out for 3 minutes and had a flash back to lunch serving duty and dreamed about chicken nuggets.   The day at the park:  " My head was spinning , all throught the contovercy of a whisical kiss. I heard dozens of voices telling me how wrong and how the world is plauged w/ these occasions coming up time and time again, ruining lives. Then an alarm goes off. Too late to turn back, to sad, too bad, its too late. Then the realization of evil sets in and upon my head. Thats another point for the devil. "  Haha to me that is hella funny, just because I know why she was thinking it all and i understand it.. Well in the past 4 days, I have only gotten about 6 hours of sleep. I will feel hella tired, and will lay down , and won't be able to go to sleep. I think im gonna go have me some Enchilada Soup.. I made it, and its hella good...    urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Damn i didnt sleep a wink last night. And i barely slept the night before... and y0u wanna know somethin.. I'm not even tired. S0 i'm tryin to upl0ad 'Scarface' pictures onto my  Lovely  AOL but its 'trippin' right now or i sh0uld say it has been for the past few days.  Cristina, i'm glad youre happy. .. shhh* Keep it on the hush, Right?! Right. S0me pe0ple think to0 much of things like when they are 0n h0ld for hella l0ng.. have you ever thought,  maybe the call wasn't f0r me.. and that i didnt call you back because all you d0 is sit there on the ph0ne anyways?   If i wanted to sit in silence i can just g0 in my ro0m , i d0nt need to be 0n the ph0ne f0r that . Take it h0wever y0u want. =)  enjoy . So anyways, i was thinking.. about this past year..and h0w fast it has gone by... And yeah its g0ne by fast. Even th0ugh when i lo0k back, things Ive d0ne this year, seem like they have happened  hella long  ag0. Like this time last year hmm, same thing was g0ing 0n between Kayla & I, n0t talking, but last year f0r n0 reas0n.. even though i'm n0t sure the reas0n now.. My take on the wh0Le situation is...  T0 be a g0od friend, you've g0t to be g0od t0 y0ur friends.  I think that 0ther pe0ple g0t in the way of 0ur friendship, and yeh she did me dirty n all but its c0o u know? i d0n need friends like that. I learn fr0m the pe0ple around me, I d0nt want pe0ple to think of me h0w  i think of my 'friends' s0o ima make sure i d0nt pull that shit... Then at the beginning of the new semester 0f my freshman yr... i g0t heavy int0 some shit ... kickin it wit Kristin.. i think that was the m0st fun i had all year.. n0 Lie.. And i  d0nt regret a damn thing   that happened. I d0nt even regret getting caught, but i'm glad i did...  i think stepping away fr0m that 'cr0wd' and th0se 'activities' sh0wed me s0me shit ya kn0w... because i was just d0ing it t0 do it.. and  i g0t caught, and i c0uld talk ab0ut it, and the wh0le thing br0ught me hella cl0ser to my m0m... and i think that wh0Le thing 'matured' me a LiL bit...  Im happy with myself f0r getting away fr0m the pr0blem.   That wh0Le time peri0d seems so far away.. kinda like... ' Damn  that was this year?'  And  what the fuck  was up wit me and th0se guys last yr...? I mean damn l0ok wh0 i g0t caught up with..  Justin .. [wh0a i d0n even kn0w what the hell was up wit that.. ] D0nte..  [ n0 c0mment] ->They didnt mean shit... they were just all talk.. wantin s0methin i wasnt b0ut t0 give them ...  hella cLose..   *wink wink*   nAa juSt playen... buT.. wE tried that wh0le 'talkin/reLati0nship' thinG  twice  and it just c0uldnt happen, which is g00d, because we hella co0L now... weLL wheN we taLk... buT yeh we hAd some g0od times this past summer...And Pj... that man wh0re... o0h g0d .. d0nt get me started ... *washed away... no l0nger a part of my th0ughts...* i'm surprised at h0w easy they all were t0 forget...hAha thats cause they werent shit to0 me...And this yr... theres the l0vely Mr. Markus... but i w0nt say anything ab0ut that... And yeH yaLL aLready know wh0 else im quiet ab0ut.. s0oo0 i d0n even kn0w wsup wit that, just kn0w.  I'm n0t trippin  haha, y0u kn0w what.... they are all black guys... I d0nt think i w0uldve made it thr0ugh this year w/o my 0Lder br0ther.. like last night, he was at his h0use and he called me at like 3 in the m0rning and was like y0u cant sleep, huh? and i was like n0pe.. n0t at all, and he said he w0ke up and felt like he needed t0 talk to me, s0 he called, and then he came over, and we just talked until ar0und 7 when he had t0 g0 t0 w0rk. He just understands me s0 well. He is 0ne 0f the m0st d0wn t0 earth 'foos' i kn0w.. and i can c0unt 0n him f0r anything, and he w0nt trip... " keep ya head up sLick... d0nt be messin wit them crazy f0o's monica... be alright.." This year, my m0m g0t a Lot w0rse, and i d0nt usually talk ab0ut her health and all, but  i'm sorry  she gets on my nerves hella bad.  And she is my m0m n all... and i l0ve her , but she makes me feel hella bad, because she'll say shit like " oh i'm sorry i cant be a better m0ther, i'm such a l0usy mother.." And you kn0w i c0uld care less what she can and can n0t d0 .. jusS that she l0ves me and wiLL always be there f0r me as a m0ther and a friend.  I c0uld n0t live  with0ut my m0ther and w0uld never want any0ne else t0 be my m0ther... she has sacrificed hella t0 make me happy... and f0r that i'm thankful.. t0 have s0me0ne wh0 will  always care  . s0. Thr0ugh everything i've ever d0ne.. i can say there are s0me things i regret, and s0me things i d0nt... but as time has g0ne by and i have g0tten 0ver those things.. i see now what ive learned fr0m it all... and  i mean , i can hella trip 0ver s0mething, but eventually time will take it away.. and  it will all just be s0mething to 'lo0k back' on.   This all g0es back to Cristinas thing about being 'real' [well.. kinda] But..  What is real?   i juss d0nt get it...  Everyb0dy just needs t0 stop fr0ntin.. [haha]  'd0n h0ld back, what if t0morr0w never c0mes and that pers0n is n0 l0nger ar0und... what w0uld y0u d0 then? h0w w0uld y0u feel? '  you kn0w what else i was thinkin b0ut? visiting my family.. i d0nt d0 it simply f0r the fact that i d0nt feel welc0me around them , due t0 the fact that they are c0ld hearted pe0ple. Like my 'father' for instance.. He has had plenty 0f chances to try t0 be in my life.. instead 0f me, he ch0se a new family with a crazy ass lady wh0 hella changed him ... and even bef0re that, he never came and g0t me or anything. And my family is talkin, oh well y0ure 0ld enough n0w to take responsibilty t0 c0me see him?  RESPONSIBILITY?   Excuse me, what is the resp0nsibility 0f a father? D0nt put that shit on me.  Ive tried. And ive given up h0pe 0n him. iTs hard f0r me to let any0ne in, just for the fact that the 0ne man i'm supp0sed to trust, d0esnt want much t0 d0 with me. And when he d0es , hes g0nna have to realize,  he fucked up.   ...Take it t0 the grave... Pe0ple can say shit, like they are g0nna change, and '0h i want to change' and y0u can  want  t0 change it, and h0w you are and stuff, but  i think that is s0mething that happens on its own. a matter 0f a 'pers0nal reality check'.  So i'm thinkin... shit will c0me naturally, what shit i'm talkin about, i'm not sure... but if its meant t0 happen, it will come. S0oner 0r Later. Damn , i feel hella better.    *cheers  "  To a new year... "

      I watched the LACI PETERSON made for tv movie tonight, and just to even THINK that they would make a movie about it just gives me the creeps. and ESPECIALLY how they used THE REAL Laci Peterson pictures in the movie. I myself think Scott is guilty, i mean c'mon her body was found by where he was fishing, he left the bay area, he didnt talk to the press, HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR. I didnt really even want to watch the movie, but I sat there and watched it, and was thinking of how her family would think to see themselves portrayed when the movie had nothing to do with them. I dont know, it just seems ethically wrong. I know these actors/actresses got paid and all but PEOPLE HAVE MORALS, and i woudlntve been in the movie. Its just wrong... things like that probably happen everyday, and if you cant trust your own husband.. then what the hell ya kn0w?   spINNin``-Big b0i- Last caLL... b0ut t0 eat`` spaghetti0's -my fav0rite! jusz g0t 0ff da ph0ne wit`` mArkuS... g0 here``    urlLink h0w t0 hypn0tize a man ...

      well markus called, and i guess we're c0o n0w. we've decided t0 stay t0gether, and w0rk things 0ut. h0pe it w0rks this time.   eVery0ne pRay f0r his grandm0ther.    Ok . i kn0w this wh0le n0t talkin t0 markus thing is gettin to me , and im sad and ive stayed sad and people can tell and then i see him and he looks all happy and shit like its nothin to him, which its probably not... and i donno it juss pisses me off to see that it doesnt bother  him ..anyways.. k i'm at home ya know and i'm watchin Oprah and its about this 'sex scandal' where this Black guy [ real cute, honor student , all star football guy] and this white girl had sex. She claims it was rape, he said it was consensual. This happenend in Georgia, you know, the whole 9 yards ppl still fly confederate flags, yadda yadda, real racist people, i know about them, i lived around them, and still do.  So , the case went to trial, the jury liberated 20 minutes, he was found innocent and aquitted of the rape charges but by georgia law, he has to serve mandatory 10 yrs b/c she was 15, he was 18. this law hasnt been used before, just in this case well so he got a 10 yr sentence, i was talkin to my mom about this [ the girl sounded hella fake like she was TRYING hella hard] and i bet you if this guy was white, he wouldnt be in prison right now. Lots of people think that. I know im datin  a black guy, and shit, i know people say stuff about that and they will, there will always be shit about inner-racial relationships...but it doesnt matter to me. California weather is so strange... raining hella hard, then goes to sunny.. then rainy and sunny at the same time and all.. whats goin on with this weather..??  today i got initiated into the CTK the CHUCK TAYLOR KREW cuhz yall kn0w i always be in sum chucks !!! so im in geometry, and theres this guy in here whos like an aspiring writer or something and hes cute.. haha yeah for an older man. well , the rain is so peaceful. Last night i couldnt really sleep, i woke up at like 2 and ate some chocolate. im such an emotional eater... thas y im hacka fat lol.... well Markus still isnt talkin to me, im sad, its so sad it makes me wanna cry and it hurts my feelings but why did his cousin come up to me and say why arent you talkin to him, see i know he was gonna make it out to be my fault. Darryl keeps sayin i should just go talk to him but i cant do that because i always do that and all he does is say sorry and i act like its all coo and im tired of doin that, im tired of talking about this shit so peace!!

      listenin to- trILLviLLe.. neva` eva`  well, i guess markus really doesnt wanna talk to me. last night on the phone he kept sayin he din have nada to say so i told him that when he has something to say he can come talk to me, and since he didnt talk to me at school, and hasnt called, i guess he really doesnt care... but i said hi to him at lunch so he cant say it was on me, which he probably will. i donno wat to d0.. s0o  i donno. but i was hella tired in 3rd blk , and i was hella bout to fall asleep ... i have both of my stupid ass slow classes after lunch it sucks. so i came home , had a pb& j sandwhich and some chocolate since im sad and all and then wentt to sleep till about 7 somethin and my bed was hella warm!! it was nice.. anyways, yall dont care about my bed lol so  i'm gonna go...  bye

Listenin to the BRITNEY Cd cristina let me b0rrow [ thanx bluh] Seein her and r0bert made me think. [ i kn0w i really shouldnt ramble 0n ab0ut  me & markus' relationship, but fuck it, i'm gonna. and if you dont care, just skip over this part...  well seeing them together reminds me of what markus and i  dont  have.  I mean c'mon now... we dont get a long, we argue, [ but wat couple d0esnt?] but he's only happy when hes getting what he wants... and like if i say something about how he acts, he'll be like what are you talking about, like he'll ignore me or be like ' get away from me ' and hella act like he doesnt wanna be around me, that shit hella makes me mad, and hes just hella shut-offish toward me all the time and wont talk about anything, and then if i get mad he finds a way to put it all on me, and i gotta all ask for hugs and all and we were on the phone and i was asking him hella questions about how he felt about us and alla this and he was like ' oh whatever i dont wanna break up with u na na na , then i asked him if he liked being single, and he was like yeah , when we dont get along, and i was like how long has it been since you can say we've gotten along, how many days in a row have we argued? he was like , we argue everyday and i was like what'd be so bad about us being apart, and he was like i'm used to the routine, what the fuck is that!!? you feel i'm not happpy in our relationship, but i know that i woulndt be happy if we break up. I mean we sit on the phone , from like 4 - 10 and talk maybe about 45 minutes out of the whole time. Hes sweet when HE WANTS TO BE. when he feels like it, and really , i'm tired of it.   Well anyways.. that shit just pisses me off so i dont know what to say/do about it.  So i'm wearin my glasses right, and it makes my computer look hella clearer.. its great , well i'm out... bbyez

What this means:     You're all for getting what you want in bed.  But you rather suggest than tell.  You're all sexual undertones - not overtones.     What your lovers love about you:     You tend to work your lover into a frenzy with teasing and flirting.  You are sweet and complementary, never too demanding.  Sex with you is a low pressure affair.     What your lovers can't stand about you:     You seem sexually moody at times...  And damn hard to please at others.  And you'll hardly ever open up about sex.      urlLink   What's *Your* Bedroom Personality?       urlLink More Great Quizzes from Quiz Diva

THen markus was talkin all sweet n bein all cute   &   shit and i was juss standin `  there and then all of a sudden the FAT security guard and hecka cops drove over to the bart station.. it was funny though.... And yeah... i found this conversation i had with pj and its hella funny.. not funny but kinda freaky.... you guys kn0w wh0s hella sexy?  ChRisTinA miLIaN   [  0h yah,   &   mark,  haha .. .]  yup and why is my m0m watching WILLY WONKA   &   THE CH0COLATE FACT0RY? that m0vie scares me!! ...but anyways i g0tta make chris   &   darrell a cd so ima go do that then do my homew0rk later too...  =D   Things in the love department may be looking up for you, dear Taurus, but beware that you aren't getting  tossed around like a puppet . It could be that your romantic partner is feeling the need for more  freedom  in the relationship, while you are hoping to gain a greater amount of  commitment . Take things one day at a time and try not to get ahead of yourself by projecting scenarios that may not ever come to fruition out into the future. You are merely  setting yourself up for disappointment  by doing so.  like stina said...  '`  deng  '`

      So, its 6:45 right now. I woke up early today [ 5:00 , usually i wake up at 6] But, you all know how that WAKING UP EARLY shit goes, ya lay there in bed for about an hour, yeah. Thats what happened.. i was gonna wake up early, do my hw [ flip book ] and take a shower, blowdry my hair... eat breakfast, buttfuck it, I just stayed in bed longer, got up, did my flipbook [ it sux ] and im gonna wait till 7, to go take a shower... Yeah i think i woke up too early. Well last night, Markus said he was gonna take the 7 o'clock [82] to my house.. and then walk to school with me, but he fell asleep [ on the phone] and i couldnt wake him up, so i dont think that is gonna be happening. I am supposed to go over his house, too, but i think his mom said no... she usually says no, then she says yes, i dunno, its confusing..?? Well yesterday i ran the mile, and i wasnt TOO tired, and had my geometry final, it was hella dumb, some of the stuff he hadnt taught us yet. I was so tired last night, i stayed on the phone/computer till 11, listenin to markus snore, and burnin cd's for his brother... then i wanted to go to bed hella bad but my aunt called and i had to talk to her for like an hour, then i went upstairs and my mom wanted me to lay with her so i watched j- leno with her but she fell asleep in like 2 minutes and every time i'd get up to go to bed, she'd wake up... but its aLL gravy. im gonna go take a shower right now, yup yup.. if i dont come home after school, everyone have a good weekend.     ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Well, i went over markus' house last night, and i know we dont get along and he treats me like shit, but i cant help the feelings i have, i hadnt seen him since thursday, but damn... It felt so good to lay there with him in his bed to have his arms around me, and mine around him... and to just see him smile at me and for us to be happy together.  It was great .  Well, i believe we have found the house we are going to move into.  =(   that sucks . Stina, youre goin to be the first one to come   &   visit me .    GOtMyPigGy:   '` but fuck it '` seems like ur sayin   BUTTFUCK   it!!

         Well, I wasnt supposed to be able to go over Markus' house yesterday, because of how he keeps getting into trouble at school, but after school he called his mom and she was like... '` Arent u going to ask if mOnica can come over?'` and Markus was like.. no.. but she said i could, so i just went over there anyways... and we washed his moms car.. it was hella funny we kept 'accidently' getting each other wet.. n we had a nice lil day.. but today he wanted me to walk up to school to go see him after Saturday school [ yeh he got a saturday ...] But i didnt, because he was gonna go to the A's game. And we was havin a 'good time' n then sum female called him on the phone n ruined it all for the whole rest of the day.... the mood , she ruined... n we watched Honey... it was ok... i 'd never seen it..     But i always need a ride home, becuase my mom cant drive n my dad sleeps, so everytime i go over there i need a ride back home and i have to be home at 10...and usually his mom would take me home, but with his grandmother in the hospital, his mom is there with her all the time, and so his dad has to take me home, and his dad works all day, comes home n sleeps, and hes been havin to wake up to take me home.. so on the way home markus was like ' my mom said you cant come over anymore unless you get a ride home' Soooo i guess i wont be goin over his house anymore.. which is for the better...  i guess because we can never just have a nice day together anyways, and i mean that may ruin our relationship even more because once your relationship becomes dependant on something ,besides just spending time together,  its  crucial for it to stay a relationship, and actually for u to be happy.. but i donno .  we'll see how things work out?     Blogger should have a warning... '` addicting '` Its true, blogging is addicting.... Vivan left & Came back... Stina left.. and  urlLink came back .... What else is there to say.. its  healthy  for us. ?

      markus makes me laugh.     immaturity.    today:     Emotionally you are apt to be feeling quite strong, Monica, but you may find that there is something brewing in the air that you do not entirely trust. Perhaps there is a feeling of uncertainty that is creeping into your mind and suggesting that you are not mentally or physically prepared for the job that you need to be doing at this time. Do not doubt yourself or your abilities. .   tomorrow: ...  Responsibilities towards family, partners, and your career might be grating on you today, Monica, and you might be thinking in terms of throwing in the towel and running away. This might actually be a good idea - for a day. Be a little adventurous; go somewhere you've never been before, or do something out of the ordinary. Tomorrow you'll be back in the swing of things and ready to face the real world again. Enjoy your day.

         Pat Tillman walked away from millions in the NFL to fight for his country in Afghanistan. He paid with his life.  The former Arizona Cardinals safety was killed Thursday night in a firefight while on combat patrol. A sergeant with the elite Army Rangers, he was 27.   ``He is a hero,'' Cardinals vice president Michael Bidwill said. ``He was a brave man. There are very few people who have the courage to do what he did, the courage to walk away from a professional sports career and make the ultimate sacrifice.''   Lt. Col. Matt Beevers, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Kabul, said a soldier was killed by anti-coalition militia forces about 25 miles from a U.S. military base at Khost, the site of frequent attacks.   A military official at the Pentagon confirmed it was Tillman, and the White House praised him as ``an inspiration both on and off the football field.''     old barbie?      urlLink sacreddotnu

       [ EDIT ] 1:05 am...     ``Fell in love, and everything that I wanted  What a life for me...  Now a thing don't mean a thing,  since we've parted  Meant the world to me...  And though my heart's still beatin',  when will i breathe again  And when will someone wake me from,  this awful dream I'm in   If you could see the way I live my life  If you could see the way I cry at night  If you could understand the reasons why  That I'm loving you still...  If you could hear me when I call your name  You gotta know it's driving me insane  You know I'll never ever love again  'Cause I'm loving you still   I had someone watch over me, my protector  Kept me safe and warm  I had someone makin' love to me,  I thought forever  But forever now is gone..  So i spend my days pretending,  I spend my nights alone   I've never missed somebody so,  I've never loved so long ``     Well i got my bed set up and everything, still have these ugly boxes.. But, right now i'm watchin&nbsp;  elimiDATE ... these girls are bitches... haha... this gurl won her boobs through a trivia game, haha. But i went out to eat with my cousin , we went to this chinese place, it was HELLLLA good!! and then we went to go see  a Cinderella story , it was hella cute, i reccomend it. But someone turned off my computer so photoshop  still  isnt all the way downloaded.. So i'm waitin on that.... But anyways ... yeah were just sittin around.. my cuzzos gon stay the night... woo hoo... and i guess markus is stayin true to him hangin up cause i checked the caller id and that negro didnt call me allll day. [  so sad ... =/ ] Well i'm outties!!  xoxo &nbsp; oh yeah hey, wats up with this new rich text blogger??  i like !! [/EDIT]     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   ROCKIN DA: blue pj's  LISTENIN TO: nelly &amp; jahiem- my place   Well, I guess me and markus arent talkin, because last night he got mad and hung up on me, and i told him dont call me back if u hang up on me, and he said if i hang up on you i'll never call you back. Oh well, i guess its just that easy . Well last night my damn tv stopped working, so i had to call the direct tv place today, so now it works. Earlier i went riding on the 4 wheeler with my brother, and it was hella fun because he goes on big ass jumps, and we drove on the street to the store we were goin like 55 and my eyes were all chinky and they were watering and yall know when in me myself and irene, hes on his motorcycle, and all the bugs hit his face, well a bug hit my ear, it was kinda nasty.... but anyways i fell off becasue he did a wheely and then got off and i wasnt holding on, it was hellllla funny!! but now my ass hurts. haha, but then we kinda 'wrecked' because he did a phat ass wheely and the wheely bar broke so i had to get up and there was all grass everywhere.
