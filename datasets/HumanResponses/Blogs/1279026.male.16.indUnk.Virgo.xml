      Top reasons to study Economics  1. Economists are armed and dangerous: "Watch out for our invisible hands."   2. Economists can supply it on demand.   3. You can talk about money without every having to make any.   4. Mick Jagger and Arnold Schwarzenegger both studied economics and look how they turned out.   5. When you are in the unemployment line, at least you will know why you are there.   6. If you rearrange the letters in "ECONOMICS", you get "COMIC NOSE".   7. Although ethics teaches that virtue is its own reward, in economics we get taught that reward is its own virtue.   8. When you get drunk, you can tell everyone that you are just researching the law of diminishing marginal utility.

      O give me a home  Where the buffaloes roam  And the deer and the antelope play   O give me a gay  Maybe timothy chay  If he’ll love me and hug me all day.   We wish him the best  Though he failed his block test  And his life and his hair is a mess   When he’s all forlorn  We will still cheer him on  And teach him d meaning of Ln.   o give him a home   where the buffaloes roam  and the deer and the antelope play   and when the animals cry  all will heave a great sigh  and timmo will falter and die

        I am a brutal warrior, my boots of war walk the earth. I am a massacrer of the masses. Courage and honor are my traits. Bravery follows me. Bushido shines on me. I am a samurai. I am a brutal warrior. Call me Apollo    I am a benevolent warrior, member of the Zulu tribe. Courage fills my soul, adrenaline courses my veins. I am the upholder of righteousness, keeper of the peace, harbinger of justice. May honor shine forth, may bushido fill my soul. I am a warrior, I am Apollo's brother, I AM ADONIS
