      The leveraged buy out (LBO) and management buy out (MBO) are common tools of American business whereby an acquiring entity will purchase its target through a combination of debt and equity.  No brilliance there right?  The clever part, however, comes in where the target company (i.e. its assets) are given as collateral for the debt.  In essence the target helps facilitate its own acquisition.  This is accepted as normal in the U.S., presumably under the belief that it leads to the most efficient allocation of capital and assets.  Across the pond though, the UK market takes a dim view of such financial moves -- it is in fact unlawful for a company to assist in the acquisition of its own shares.  This is commonly referred to as the "no financial assistance" rule.  Assistance is defined generally as a guarantee, indemnity, gift or security provided to the acquiror.  Aside from apparent common sense foundation that -- if you can't afford it on your own, you shouldn't buy it, this rule is primarily designed to protect creditors and the capital inside the target corporation.  It is not a blanket prohibition however, and the UK provides for a "whitewash" test (what we would call a "safe harbor").  The "whitewash" rules will not be covered in this posting.    France and Germany similarly have rules against financial assistance for much the same policy reasons as the UK.  France allows no whitewash, whereas German transactions can be structured generally to comply with the legal tests.    There remain open issues as to whether and how the emergence of the EU will standardize national corporate legal policies.  For now, transactions within a country are controlled by that country's corporate legal structure. As shown here, Europe can be quite a different playing field that the U.S.  [Many thanks to Focus Europe Summit 2004, and  urlLink Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP  for source materials on this topic.]

      It is axiomatic (lawyers love saying that) that the world is becoming a smaller place through advances in transportation, the deployment of the Internet and capitalism's relentless push for lower cost labor and physical inputs to the economic equation.&nbsp; Borders simply matter less as an economic matter.&nbsp;   Borders still matter quite a bit in the American practice of law however.&nbsp; For example, it is still generally required practice that an attorney pass each  state's  bar exam in order to practice law in that state's jurisdiction.&nbsp; (There are exceptions in some states for 1 time appearances, arbitrations and so forth).&nbsp;   So what do we do when we have&nbsp;a defendant, or multiple defendants,&nbsp;in a foreign jurisdiction that we seek to bring to justice in the United States on the basis of ongoing ties to the United States?&nbsp; or simply on the basis that they have fled the jurisdiction of a particular country?&nbsp; This is where " urlLink The Hague Convention " comes into play.&nbsp; The Hague convention describes the methods by which service may be accomplished in a foreign jurisdiction    urlLink for signatories to the Convention   .&nbsp; Note that not all countries are signatories.&nbsp;   Whenever attempting to serve parties in a foreign jurisdiction we recommend consulting the civil procedure practice guide for your jurisdiction (in California, we recommend the Rutter Group series) and then cross-reference the state requirements with the Hague Convention.&nbsp; Following this approach should show you the proper way to deliver service, whether or not the target party's country of residence is a signatory to the Hague Convention.   &nbsp;
