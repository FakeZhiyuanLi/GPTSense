      My name is Greg and this is my story. After you read this, you'll understand why everybody thinks I'm a big, fat loser. I grew up in Pacifica surfing on the beach with my ten foot woody at the tender age of five.Shaka Brah!! Once I got bumped by a great white!!!But I fought it off with a piece of drift wood nearby. I then moved to Hayward. And shortly after I went on a hunting trip with my father and I got struck by lighting but don't ask my mom about it because shes' too traumatized to speak about it. Damn that hurt!! I have had a lot of interesting jobs since then. While I was attending Tennyson High School I drove a hurse. I would like to think of it as a morbidly fascinating job.I became temporarily unemployed. Perhaps it was because of my late night mung jumping fetish.I then became a bouncer in San Francisco but the gay men kept beating me up.So I finally figured I had enough of the exotic jobs and I put in an application at my local Radio Shack.But that turned out to be worse because of all the fighting in the store. I beat up more people there then I did working at the club in San Francisco.All of the stress at the Radio Shack job made my heart problems get worse and I had to jab a heart needle into my chest with my last ounce of strength.And then!!!And no more and then!!!Since I wasn't picking up any hot babes at the local Radio Shack I decided to quit my job and start batting for the other team. I guess all those gay clubs rubbed me the right way.I met this really tall dark and handsome boy with a stubbly chin named Orlando. That summer we kissed and I knew at that moment I had made the transition from a boy to man hood. As he fondled my supple man breasts on the grassy knoll, I knew he was Mr. Right. Just as I was about to reach Home Base (hee hee), my dad called to tell me to take out the trash. Due to my homophobic father, I could no longer see Orlando and I had to settle for a green dildo and a large container of vaseline.  During the summer, I took a trip to Reno for Hot August Nights. I rode a Harley along with some of my friends, who also took their bikes. You wouldn't believe how many hot chicks couldn't get enough of me! I have had a couple of jobs since then but my freak accidents always land me back into enemployment.One day I met the perfect girl she looked like me, she smelled like me, and she also could never keep a job like me.What a coincidence she had the same freak accidents as me.Its twelve 'o' clock i love you the most im in love with you most and you're the cutest.Im in love so much that my dick is glowing like a glaze donut.And beacuse I live with my parents I will never have to work again.This is great they even said they would buy me a house in Woodchuck.
