       i feel like crying.  and i can't form any thoughts as to why. perhaps its being lonely, but it's not as if i want to talk really. but i do. it's incredibly fustrating to be struggling with yourself on whether or not you want to do something. it's as if i'm a hammock tied upsidedown between two trees. the wind keeps blowing, yet i haven't managed to swing myself upright. back and forth. back and forth. (but not quite as calm, perhaps a hammock in a tornado.)        i really dislike the song "the reason" by hoobastank, albeit i'm listening to it right now. (reject internet radio only allows you 5 skips, and sadly i've used them all.) the logical choice would be to change stations, only that takes far to much effort than i'm willing to set forth. although i informed launch to "never play again." --that's great, i'm feeling all non-happy and "my immortal" starts playing. where's my 50 cd? or linkin park, that would work too...drowning pool would also suffice, or even johnny cash's not slow songs.       school commences for me on friday. i'm not sure if i want to return anymore. i'd like to curl up by myself. no, that's bad. i'll go. frankly, i'm scared to be breaking out of high school, and going to (part time) real college. wsu is fairly "real" and i hope i can survive being a little kid in a big kid world. when i was five i used to see middle schooler's as cool and it's happening again only on an older scale. i think it's ageism in society.       i ought to watch reservoir dogs. mr. pink makes me laugh. or perhaps the 1962 manchurian candidate. raymond shaw makes funny jokes. (yes, the groucho marx thing is quite humourous.) in any event who's "modest mouse"? (launch has serious defecit's in music).

       i'm not the typical "ettya" at this moment: but i haven't expirenced this emotion- it's alien. it's as if i'm being yanked between extremes of how i want to mold me, how others want me to be molded (although expectations are low) and how i want to be molded for others. i've been fighting internally, and i feel as if the conflict is beginning to ferment in my overt actions. therefore, before i take up an action which may hurt another, i wish to appologize. or perhaps, i haven't changed nor am i seeking to. there are few who care to listen and few whom i care to tell.    also, i feel lost as to a certain other matter of decreasing significance. simply, i regret blabbering a few secrets of mine to another. and i need to talk to a specific third party, although i have an irking notion that i'm being held around the base.    i miss several people in kansas, although many would misinterpret the notion of "several" and immediatley pair that word with those whom they believe i ought to. no, i'm not angry, upset or driven in any respective manner, i'm simply ambivalent. it's rather amusing- the concept of not caring either way. for upon my arrival, a fresh segement of life begins, and i shan't have to reflect to less smiling times. (if only i can achieve that state this sememster)    post was confusing, upon reading it. i suppose though, it's reminescent of me at this moment. incoherant and disengaged. perhaps a few days shall fit the puzzle together- unlikely. does anyone else think that perhaps  humpty dumpty was suffering from a mental defecit ?

       on this lovely, enchantingly, muggy evening of friday the 13 of august, i romped over to the local loews theater. there, i traded a few dollars (ahem 9) for the viewing of farenheit 9-11. i was touched by the film, and brought to tears by images of not only our american soldiers in anguish, but shots of innocent iraqis. there were some humourous moments presented to us by the buffoon america didn't elect to office. i came away from the film feeling guilty that i live in such a nation, and that i dislike a man (several indeed, as well as corporations) without knowing them personally. (although i'm not sure of the extent to which i can "know" halliburten...) i'm a bit distraught by as bushie boy put it the "haves, and the have mores [...] my [george w. bush's] base." i find that sick.   this person had a shirt today which read beautifully "November 2, 2004: The End of an Error." the republicans have lied again in a pitiful attempt to destructure the kerry campaign in having "former people who served with the senator in vietnam" say untrue things about kerry's actions.    i wish i could vote.

       if one could use the word " tweakish " to describe emotion, it would cover my feelings on this new morning. although i'm not quite sure what the word connotes to, it has permeated my mind, and thus i choose to describe myself as tweakish. i'm anxious, but not for any particular event. as it is, i have less in the immediate future to be cheery about. (immediate meaning with in the next 7-9.5 hours. perhaps then, its the anxious in an "anxiety" way which is often means an overall crummy feeling which urges forth a flood to break away my dam.       but despite the foreboding notion, i maitain that morning's are the most wonderful interval of any 24 hours. (morning being operationalized as 4:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. broadly referencing.) shorter days and longer nights have my bid as well. i loathe setting the clock back an hour because it elongates the period in which i can be destroyed. you see, at night, nothing can harm me. i am tucked away in my pocket. the world cannot see me, although i can see a fraction of it, through my window. the money is skewed slightly in my favor, however i am content maintaining the tense realtionship. no, i wish we could reconcile, but it seems as if that is an impossibility.      i'd like to purchase a softserve ice cream machine (similar to the one's they used to have at mcdonalds'). three spouts of icecream are in many ways reminescent of life. you can have all chocolate or all vanilla which are brilliant on their own. however, as you mix the two, and create "swirl" the icream combination is never perfect. you either have too much vanilla or too much chocolate. of course, this is despite the fact that "swirl" is expelled from the center spout which allegedly maintains a balance. furthermore, if indeed the icecream comes out in equal proportions, the only way to maintain chocolate on one side and vanilla on the other is to squash it into a cup or a bowl or a cone. when squashed, often times you find yourself with a sticky mess. in anyevent, i did have a point to that rambling, but it has escaped me and gone to find itself a treat...      i think i've screwed up my highschool education with my "not" schedule next year:   1) college release   2) English/Teacher's Aide   3) see above   4) college release   5) work pass   6) college release   7) workpass   note: college releases and workpasses are interchangeable. i have yet to decide which english class to insert myself into. and working 20 hours a week is the trade off for not going to school for two. that's a baloney deal. (no, i don't know how to spell the word with the "g" therefore, i spellt it the way i would rewrite the Oxford dictionary.)    in anyevent, have a cheers-y day.

       crying purges your body of wasteful emotions. while  tears   fall awa  y , they carry the granuals of depression, anxiety, and anger with them. although, after a good session of this emotional cleansing, i still feel rather empty. it's as if i am a dull void which was only filled with bitter thoughts, but now, since those have gone, i have nothing. while that may be horrible to read, it's stronger than i intended the thought to be.  i miss reservoir dogs and mostly mr. pink. the bourne supremacy was an alright movie. the car chase was a bit exaggerated; but nonetheless, brilliantly portrayed. yet this leaves me wondering at what point the bourne ultimatium will reach theatres? (perhpas 2 years later- 2006?) in other movie news, troy duffy is releasing the sequel to the boondock saints, allegedly this year. perhaps this time, since we are not in the midst of a crisis, people will flock to see this masterpiece.  not counting the day i return from massachusetts, i have 13 days. which means, 14 until i return to andover high to endure another montonous year. there are also 14 days before my first wsu class, that's pseudo exciting. a state college expirence vs the 'oh-so-challenging' butler county community college.

         rain is the most wonderful creation  that He published on this planet. as i look out my window, my vision is skewed by multitudes of transparent, 3 dimensional drops of the liquid. it would be lovely if i could collect a storm cloud and place it in my closet; i would have a secret stash of rain as well. in any event, i don't believe that's physicall possible, but the thought and concept are both grand. i hope the sky turns it's button's loose again today. i woke up a tad late, and was unfortunate enough to miss the sky relieving itself.     writing here serves as a reminder that i have been procrastinating far too long. the programmed instruction will have to wait, i'm enjoying the bliss of a grey day. i'm dead on ideas, and haven't written anything midly productive yet here. ideas escape me, perhaps they have gone out to play in nature's sprinklers?

      not to burden anybody with more complaints, but i absolutely loathe days where one's mind does not seem able to focus on on task for more than a few moments. i know i should be working diligently on some sort of task, however, i cannot bring myself to shove mind energy into it. no, i will complete the work eventually. i have to, it's not an option. yet my mind continues to drift away from me, and from my outer desires to it's own desolate planet. i am two, but it has packed its neuron's and traveled a great distance. its frequent flyer bonus's must be brilliant.  its interesting, how as you age, your needs tend to dissapate, at least in your own mind. i crave not the material gifts i have received in previous years for holidays such as Christmas and the like.  i've also  come to view birthday's as dismal , foreboding celebrations. why else would you submerge another in gifts if you were not implying that "i give these to you in order that you may wish to exist on this planet for another year?" the whole concept is realtively creepy. i only hope that the aforementioned is not the true intention that friends donate items to others. however, lurkingly enough, i think that is the purpose. afterall, why should anybody be celebrated for living another arbitrary 365 days? it's not as if the difference between being 16 and 364 days is any different feeling than being 17 and 1 day. it's what society deems it. afterall, the difference in maturity is not even negligible, but america dictates that at 16 yrs, 364 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds you are not capable of viewing a rated "R" movie; yet at 17 yrs, 0 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds, you can handle it...the same applies to purchasing cigarettes at 18 and drinking at 21.  i think that perhaps, i've outraged myself. somebody ought to propose this to the world: we abolish agism because it only arises more questions. exactly why is one year the determined length of time of approximately 365 days? why cannot the earth travel around the sun for 1.5 cycles before it is deemed 1 year? or .5 a cycle (which would be beneficial as it would raise life expectancy in years as well as optimacy for the 50 yr olds...)

        mornings are by far the best section of day created.  it's lovely awaking at 7:00 a.m.  knowing that most of the world is still in silent slumber (although i don't believe it's that early). it's almost as if you control the world, a feeling of jealous possession consumes about the empty yards, unpenetrated skies, and the untouched waters of a local pool. anyhow, walking around then (now) is the only time i feel in control of anything. it's pleasent how the world is new and belongs, for a cycle to me. as long as i can't see/hear/be around other humans, i'm content.      there's also the matter of what the day will donate. it's almost as if you're waiting in line at the salvation army in hopes that a benz will appear. while the incidence may seem extreme and unlikely, the possiblity it could happen keeps you there...waiting. mornings are waiting for the good/the bad/ the extreme of the day. it's exciting, yet foreboding.       night's are pretty too, in the sense of the physical world. it's falling asleep and you can watch. it's a miracle to view the industry closing it's mouth until the next day, when it will again commence in consuming the people. the last sheltered laughs of children are also heard around 8, which signal the impending sleep of this section of the world.       however, nights are a time to contemplate the day's gifts. whether they be great or abhorrent, night's are like a permanent seal being placed over your actions, their actions. it signal's a time of no reversal, but- ironically- an end to the day's deciet, decepitons as well as pleastentries. if you'd lost domination over your actions/thoughts during the day, the sun's retiration allows you to regain control or as much of it as you wish.      although i'm not quite certain where i was going with that post, i do know that it's 8:07 a.m. eastern time, and i still do wish to be back home. in kansas, where the sunrises are colorful and the stars glitter and glissen on black velvet. massachusetts has neither. the night's physicality is black, inturrupted by the glare of a streetlamp and the loud montony of street dances and entertainment. the morning air isn't pure, for it is rocked by the vibrations of dump trucks and lawn mowers (in my locale).

       i've been too generous with error's that i've made. i feel regretful, though i shouldn't. i've sliced away a big chunk of burden which should have been dealt with some time ago. eh, although i'm not sure if it was the right thing to do...      i need to find some humor or some wonderfully enchanting asset.   funny people allow for smiles  and i would like that ability: to make people be greatful for being alive. however, i suppose the first key to this is meeting that goal myself. being a teenager tastes worse than sardines smell, yet at the same time, it's rather exhilirating. knowing that 15 years from now, my world will be different is a comforting thought. but i don't know if i want it to change. perhaps i'll come to cherish the blunders i've made as an intricate part of adolescense. after all, how can one learn if one doesn't err.       embarressment is another factor though. it is agreeable that we all could do away with that squeemish feeling recieved upon compeleting a daunting task with minimal avail. for instance, if you've written something you find truely brilliant, then you take it to class and hear 15 of your peers claim it was junk, that's embaressing. (eh, forgot where i was going with that point)      in any event, i am looking forward- God forbid- to senior year. should be fun, seeing as my association with my soon to be former classmates will be little. although, i do regret this, which i can't believe i've admitted...nonetheless, i hope that the final year of high school turns out brilliantly for all.       looking back on memories of grades past, i can't recall a specific level of education which i found extraneously preposterous either academically or socially other than frosh year. the memories are humourous on the outside, and cease to plague me on the inside. especially that of gym class. although it drove me nutso on the inside knowing that i simply wasn't picked for teams, the image of a 14 year old girl sitting in the middle of the gymnasium while the other students departed for teams. i was like a fish caught in the divide of the sea. no pity, just laughter now.       now that i've likely bored somebody, i'll retreat until tomorrow. i think perhaps i'm going to abandon my livejournal and revert to this blog thing. it's much more fun.
