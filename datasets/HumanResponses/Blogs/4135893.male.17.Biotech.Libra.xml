      Yeah! So many things to say so little time.   I wish i was poetic enough to truly do justice to her beauty and greatness. I just wish i can always look forward to looking into those amazing eyes of hers. Unfortunately i suck with poetry and could never express myself that way.  Jake is gone starting tomorrow. And thus our group of four is reduced to three.  And unto the mortals so sayeth the Lord Quark unto his people, "Lo, lookest thee upon the bounty of this land upon which you shall settle. Blamest not for mine father  UL , for his ineptitude in making the world for he was beseiged by the scourge in the wasteland.  Where has my little kitty gone?   I need sleep.  - Jovial

      It appears that i need friends on blogspot to comment on my awesome pictures. I wonder how i am going to go around gaining the friends. O well. Jake leaves for college monday and that makes me sad. Life goes on, no? Before too long i shall be leaving as well and that will make me part ways with many people at least for a time. AT any rate i shall stall have the internet to keep me in touch with everyone and its not like im  that  far away from home. At any rate ill prolly cruise around blogspot looking for friends and then hit the sack because we have a full day ahead of us at the Ren Faire. YAy ren faire pics and good times. Well that s enough babel for now - Jovial

       Welcome to Quirks and Quarks! I suppose the purpose of this blog would be to rant about small things that annoy me in the personalities of others and at the same time discuss anything scientific. Well thats not really accurate on the scientific part. To tell the truth i would talk about anything with anyone. Ill probably just sit around talking about books and movies and music and such along with some ideas about the world i have. I dont know. Whatever happens happens. It all works :)
