        It's just another boring day with no rain, which really sucks because i love the rain.&nbsp;Well volleyball season is supposed to start next week but i haven't gotten a paper for two-a-days yet so i am a bit skeptical.&nbsp; There are so many different things that i could be doing right now, but no i am here at home typing on this stupid computer and taking up precious time. lol. Oh well i guess i really don't have a life, but it's all good i would rather know that i am safe at home then at a party being drugged or something. Since that seems to happen alot, i would rather not risk it and just stay home being boring.&nbsp; Yes i said it i am boring and i ain't afraid to admit it.&nbsp; For all of you who know me would have to agree and for all of you that hate me just shut the hell up ain't ask you.&nbsp;

        School is coming again and it really sucks because now i have to face all the haters again.&nbsp;Man i so wish that i didn't have to it would be the greatest.&nbsp; But being a Senior means i only have one more year before i get out of this God foresaken town.&nbsp;Unlike some people who i am sure are going to stay here for the rest of their lives, which will really suck.&nbsp; this year is going to be more difficult then last because now i have some new haters to add to my list (yes i am hated on a lot which i guess means i am a bad person) but that doesn't matter i guess i can always stay with who is true to me.&nbsp; The world won't stop for you haters, which mean neither will mine.&nbsp;So i guess i should say bring on the haters i am ready.&nbsp; All i have to do is Shake you haters off!!

        Look ok don't get me wrong i loved the V-4, but now i love the V-3 even more becuase we stayed true to eachother and the game you left it wasn't our fault not your's either.&nbsp; But you see you can't wear a jersey you can't play so just please get over it you were still our friend just not in the group you over exaggerated what we did.&nbsp; We didn't mean to hurt you but you took it that way so please just leave it alone.&nbsp; We were good with you but you have to understand we will be even better without you to way us down.&nbsp; So please let it go and let us go we love the game more then you do so please just let us play.&nbsp; Ashley I'm sorry for how you feel about this but it's the way things go.&nbsp; I don't hate you i never will but you have to get over it and let it go.&nbsp;
