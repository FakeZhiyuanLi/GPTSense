      Ok, so I told you yesterday that I was going to try and formulate a plan for this weekend, when my guests arrive from out of town. And I sort of have a plan, but more of a commitment to myself to make healthy choices.    I started off by trying to pinpoint where we were going to eat and then see if they had a menu online so that I could plan ahead. Actually, I started off by making low calorie yogurt bran muffins so that I would have some healthy breakfasts for the next couple of days. Then I talked over the plan with Boo (future hubby).  Boo wanted to remain very up in the air about a few of the times we were going to eat which was really frustrating me. We got a couple of things resolved, though. Here is the tentative schedule for the weekend:   Breakfast Saturday:  bran muffins and fruit, coffee Mid Morning – Mid afternoon:  urlLink MassMoCa  Lunch Saturday: “someplace trendy” in Williamstown, MA  (plan of attack: salad) Late afternoon:  urlLink Clark Gallery  and  urlLink Williams College Art Gallery  Dinner: Restaurant Saigon (cheap Vietnamese restaurant… plan of attack: one of their big soups)  Breakfast Sunday: late breakfast/brunch at diner or luncheonette (plan of attack: look for a one egg breakfast or maybe fruit and oatmeal) Midday Sunday:  urlLink Hyde Collection  Late afternoon:  urlLink Davidson’s Brewery  (plan of attack: if they want an appetizer, go with the black bean hummus. For entrée: either ½ buffalo burger or a big salad. 1 tasty beer) Dinner (if we are hungry): Something from the South Beach Cookbook that friend is supposed to bring.   Breakfast Monday: bran muffins, fruit and coffee Mid morning ??? Lunch: Some kind of salad if they are still here,  leftover eggplant stew from Friday if they are gone.   I may be up on calories because, like I said yesterday, I am a member of the “clean plate club” and am still learning appropriate portion sizes.  I didn’t include an exercise plan because we will be walking at the museums, and I am going to ask those guys if they are into going the gym – we can buy them guest passes for Sunday if they are.   All in all, I feel confident that I will not be tempted to make unhealthy choices this weekend. My goal is to hold steady – if I make it through the weekend without a gain, I will be happy. Happy Memorial Day everybody!!!

      Here is why this week is shot as far as seeing a lower number on the scale:   (1)	Sunday, 2 sausages and potato salad (2)	Monday, 2 more sausages and potato salad (3)	Tuesday, snacks and sushi (4)	Weds, veggie wrap, chili, coolata, almonds (5)	The gym has been closed Weds. And Thurs. for a Jewish holiday. (6)	Saturday, Sunday, and Monday: eating plan is up in the air because guests are coming from out of town.  (7)	Saturday, Sunday, Monday, exercise plan is up in the air because guests are coming from out of town  That leaves today and tomorrow as likely days where I will not go over on my calories. In the future, I gotta learn that one sausage and bun maketh a main dish. The weekend might not totally be shot because said guests are on the South Beach Diet. I asked them what I should have on hand in the house, and they said they #1 thought we would go out to eat and #2 would bring their cookbook and we could decide on something in it and then go shopping. But I don’t know when we will have time to go shopping because the main purpose of their visit is to see two art galleries that are each about an hour from my house. So although I might be safe, I foresee several meals out in restaurants, and as a lifetime member of the “clean plate club” that is very dangerous for me. I guess my “action item” is to come up with a plan for the weekend, which I will meditate on and post tomorrow.

      A couple of days ago, I wondered on this blog what I was going to eat on Tuesday after my late night at the University.  Usually, I have fast food, but after seeing the movie Super Size Me, I felt like it was time to cut this behavior out NOW.  I thought about bringing some energy bars to eat on the way home, but that somehow didn’t seem so exciting.  One friend suggested Chinese take-out but that can be just as bad if not worse than the fast food, so that was out.  Then Boo (a.k.a. Future Hubby) suggested that he pick up some supermarket sushi on the way home from his guitar lesson and have that waiting for me when I got home.  After thinking about it, I decided Bingo!  This would be my new approach to dealing with late Tuesday nights.   Now part of the problem with Tuesdays was not just the fast food exploit at night, it is the snacking in the library office prior to my evening shift. This time, however, I had a yogurt, an energy bar, and a fruit cup.  All in all, I finished the day just over 2000 calories, which is a 33% improvement of my usual 3000+ calorie Tuesdays.  And the sushi was great! Boo got me an avocado roll and a spicy salmon roll, and it did indeed feel like a reward. I can’t even begin to tell you how much I appreciate his support and his efforts to help me achieve my goal. I am truly fortunate.   So, for now it’s sushi on Tuesday nights until further notice. Good bye, Quarter Pounder with Cheese!

      I can no longer function without artificial sweeteners.  It all started with Diet Pepsi. I used to hate diet sodas, but eventually found that Diet Pepsi wasn’t so bad. Then came Diet Dr. Pepper, also not too bad (after all, it “tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper,” right?).  Then came this Diet Cape Cod Cranberry stuff, and the rest is history. I now prefer diet soda to regular soda. This is after 10 years of drinking the stuff. I drink diet iced tea, diet lemonade, you name it. Diet drinks are a staple of my fluid intake.  Then, today I knew I would have to work late, and thought I would get some coffee in my system before leaving my morning job. The coffee at my morning job is not so tasty, so I was thinking about putting sugar in the coffee, then I remembered, Lo! The kitchen stocks packets of Equal and Splenda, so there is no need to put the real stuff in my coffee. Happily, I took two yellow packets, and emptied them into my cup and stirred.   I do not have that much of a sweet tooth, but even still, I would be ingesting way more sugar and calories if it wasn’t for Splenda, Equal and Sweet and Low. I know I am supposed to be moving away from processed to whole foods, but on this point I am not ready to give in. It is still a crutch. Diet soda tastes better and adds variety to my fluid intake of water, iced tea, and coffee.  Some day, I know this is a habit I am going to have to move away from, but right now, I am just not ready.  The benefits of the calorie free sweetener still outweigh the down sides.

      It looks like my “lazy” streak is over. By lazy, I mean, only 1 hour of personal training Thursday morning, no walk at night, 20 minutes of rowing Friday morning and no walk at night, and Saturday was a complete lump.    As is our habit, Future Hubby and I did make it to the gym on Sunday morning. Walked for an hour on the treadmill, getting in 3.5 miles, a record for me. I tried to approach it the way my PT says to look at it: instead of thinking, “Oh, I am going to suck because I haven’t been working out”, think “Ok, I am rested and fresh ‘cause I’ve had a day off, so today I am going to kick ass”. And you know what? It worked. Later that day we walked to the movies, making my total for the day 5.5 miles. Woot!  Food was tricky this weekend. First there was the Pizza pig-out Friday night. Future Hubby took me out to dinner at one of our favorite pizza places, and then to see a play. I ate 4 slices of pizza, which were loaded with toppings and extra cheese. Did I mention the beer? We split a pitcher. By my calculations, the dinner was 1400 calories, just about what I usually eat in an entire day. Saturday was good, just over 1400 calories. Sunday was disorganized, and we had a late breakfast out (bagel with egg, ham and cheese) and then a sausage dinner which I gauged at 1100 calories, bringing me to 1700 calories for the day.  I am more annoyed at this unplanned excess than I am at the pizza – at least I knew the pizza was coming ahead of time.  I am changing habits slowly, and this week I will work on planning better on the weekends. Right now (except for the Tuesday night thing I talked about yesterday) weekends are the toughest. I think if I can get weekends under control, I will find all those special occasions, parties, holidays, and family events to be more manageable. We’ll see.   Wedding Update: Mom wanted to hear about the cake. Well, it’s going to be a layer of chocolate and a layer of vanilla separated by Bavarian crème filling. We are opting for artificial flower decorations in lieu of a cake topper, but that could change if we see a topper we like. The frosting pattern is hard to describe, but rest assured it is very pretty.

      I am feeling a little bit of anxiety after seeing the movie  urlLink Super Size Me . I am thinking “What on earth am I going to eat now on Tuesday nights?”  Super Size Me is the documentary which premiered at Sundance about a guy that ate nothing but McDonald’s food for 30 days.  In the process, he gains around 20 pounds, over 10% of his body weight, his liver gets shot to hell and is compared to an alcoholic’s liver, his mood and energy levels deteriorate, and he begins to only feel good when he eats, a sign that he has become “addicted” to the food. The movie talks a lot about obesity, even showing a gastric bypass operation. He hits hardest on the effect McDonald’s advertising has on children. It is very well done and highly recommended.   Here’s the thing: every Tuesday night I work till 9pm and then swing through McDonald’s, Burger King or KFC on the way home. According to the movie, people who eat at McDonald’s once a week are “Super Users”. I am almost a Super User. This scares the fucking bejeezus out of me (pardon my language, Mom!).  Future Hubby says I should just bring a sandwich and eat that, but somehow that doesn’t feel like a reward for working late and a quarter pounder with cheese does.  And while I have known for a while that I needed to figure out a “plan b” to keep from eating all this fast food, it has been something I was going to deal with some other time. Like maybe when I hit a plateau. Or something. Now I feel panicky that this is something I must address NOW.   I gave up fast food two years ago for lent and found that I didn’t miss it, and prior to that I was eating fast food three or four meals a week. Surely I can cut out that one trip through the drive-thru on Tuesday nights. I just haven’t thought of something that is going to provide the instantaneous gratification and sense of reward. The best I can come up with is an energy bar. I will keep you posted on how I make out.

      And then sometimes, something will happen that will just kill a perfectly good mood. It was Friday, and I was at the University where I work in the afternoons, tending the reference desk.  A young man came up and asked about the phone books. And then he said something that froze me dead in my tracks: “Congratulations on your baby… how far along are you?”    Now, I know I haven’t mentioned this yet, but rest assured, I am NOT pregnant.  I was wearing a dress that, although a little tight, was one I could not fit into at all last year. Usually I wear loose things to hide my belly. I guess in this dress, it was more pronounced  than usual.   I was speechless. I turned about 50 shades of red and just started clicking away on the computer, and he went away.  I know there must be a way I could have handled this better --some clever way of sounding like I was indeed pregnant without actually committing to a lie, but right now I can’t think of a one.   Future Hubby tried to pacify me. “He was kind of giving you a compliment,” FH said. But in no way was he giving me a compliment. Trying to be nice maybe, but complimenting? No.   And this simple, well intended gesture has kind of made me feel like all my efforts have been for naught. The best I can do is remind myself of Dr. Phil’s advice, and say to myself: “If I stick to a plan of eating and exercise, the weight will eventually come off.”  Lately I have been pretty good at positive reinforcement, but now it is going to be hard to keep that “Congratulations on your baby” out of my head.   Right now I am just telling myself “Eyes on the prize, baby, eyes on the prize.”

      Well, it seems the minute I start writing about “the wave” it begins to fade. First, even though the temperature was in the 70s and it was sunny yesterday evening, I only walked to the drug store and back. I should have taken a longer walk since I had the time (Future Hubby was at a class). I just didn’t feel like it.   And then this morning, well… one of the arc trainers is broken and the other one was being used. And my two favorite treadmills (the ones with the little televisions on them) were also in use. I have gotten really fussy about what equipment I use at the gym for some reason. So anyway, the arc trainers and the treadmills being used, there was only one other type of machine I feel comfortable using – the rower. I rowed 3500M, but it only took a little over 18 minutes. Then I used one of the cybex machines to twist my obliques, and then I kind of puttered around until Future Hubby was done. I broke a sweat, but I seriously doubt my heart rate got up in the 60% of maximum rate range that is needed for a meaningful cardio workout.   I was feeling kind of bummed about this, but then I was remembering that three months ago when I started this program, I probably couldn’t have rowed 3500M period, much less in 18:20. And that my paradigm has shifted from “some movement is better than no movement” to “must have quality movement at a given heart rate”… thank my personal trainer for that shift.  No yoga tomorrow because they are running some kind of seminar at the center, so I will do one of my DVDs in place of the class.   The weekend after this one, my friends are coming from out of town, and I need to plan strategy for eating and exercising. They are trying to lose weight too so I will probably touch base with them and see what they have been doing and see what we can do together so that none of us get off track.

      A friend says I shouldn’t question why sticking to a weight loss plan is so easy right now,  I should just “ride the wave” … I’ll keep that philosophy in mind, but I’d really rather have a simple trigger to fall back on. Push these buttons in my psyche, and boom! Losing weight is a breeze. Maybe I am asking too much. I haven’t even hit a plateau yet.   Still doing good on the food, had around 1600 calories yesterday, but that is ok because the day before I was around 1400.  It’s when I get into 1700 and 1800 that I want to watch out for.  Yesterday I worked out for ½ hour in the morning (row 3000M, 10 min on arc trainer), and took a 2.5 mile walk. Here’s something new: I didn’t feel like walking, so I walked FASTER to get it over with. Three months ago, I would have walked slower so as not to exert myself. That’s something. Small victories.   Like my Future Mother In-Law says, I am working on changing habits and changing habits takes time.  I hope this “easy” period is the result of good habits starting to sink in.  In the mean time, hand me a surf board, cause this wave is, like, totally tubular!

      I am more motivated to lose weight than I have ever been in my life. Granted, I didn’t need to lose any weight until I was about 24. More on that another time.  The point is, I have been finding it relatively easy these past two weeks to stick to a regular exercise schedule and keep my food in line. This past weekend, I was glad that we were only eating away from home one time, so that I could control portions, and therefore keep my calories in line. I haven’t felt compelled to drive through Dunkin Donuts or Burger King on my way home from work. I get up in the morning and work out even when I know I’ll have time to do it in the afternoon. And the results have been positive, last week I lost 2 pounds, and I am sure I am well on the way to another loss this week.   Quite frankly, I don’t get it. I have been racking my brain to try and analyze why it is so easy for me right now, when sometimes all I want to do is eat in restaurants, buy taquitos and ice cream, and sleep in. Sometimes, I really feel like I can’t stop myself from pulling in at Burger King on the way home. Some weekends, I want to eat breakfast in a diner, lunch in a pub, and a fancy French restaurant for dinner. Some mornings, it’s all I can do just to get to the personal trainer twice a week. And when I deny those urges, I feel deprived, and I barter with myself and make compromises. But right now I do not feel deprived. Why? What’s so different now?  I know part of it is the success I felt when I learned I had lost 2 inches off my waist after 3 months of working out. Part of it is reading the blogs and message boards (“ urlLink Indie Rock Librarian ” got me started on weight loss blogs, but “ urlLink Scale Whore ”’s list is more current, the  urlLink Skinny Daily Post  has excellent advice). Part of it is that I when I tried on the mock up of the wedding dress my mom made for me it was too tight in the belly. But somehow, I feel there is something I am missing. Some elixir of weight loss if you will, that I would like to capture in order to extend my current state of ease or provide a jump start if my motivation fades.   Let me know if you have any idea...

      You may have noticed that my goal weight as stated on this blog is 185 pounds. You may be thinking to yourself, “Librarian, that is still overweight for a 5’4”, 35 year old female.” Well, I know this, but the truth is, I only have 20 weeks until my wedding and I am not even sure I can get down to 185 in that time frame.  I have decided recently that I am going to continue on trying to lose after my wedding, and get down to what is considered a healthy weight for my height, build and age. For that effort however, I have decided to take stock and set new goals after my honeymoon. Right now the focus is on the wedding, and so my weight loss goals are more modest.   I didn’t go to the gym yesterday morning and as a result was sluggish all day. Took a 3 mile walk with Future Hubby before dinner.  Stayed around 1550 calories. Yay!  Thanks to everybody who has emailed me and said you have to be a Blogger member to post comments on my site. I know other blog authors who use the same Blogger.com interface, but their comment posting is available to everyone. *update* Lo! And Behold! I figured out how to make the comment posting available to everyone, so post away!!!  In the future, I want to do other enhancements to the page, I am not all that happy with the current setup, for one thing the profile is too much like some kind of online dating service profile, and that is not what I am interested in. But that is for the future, right now I am just trying to get this thing off the ground. Thanks for your support!

      Since this blog is primarily about my fitness journey, I thought I would give you my philosophy (program? techniques?) for getting in shape and losing weight.  First: I am following the advice of a nutritionist I saw 2 years ago and a psychologist who ran a medical study in which I participated, and am trying to eat 1500 calories per day. Supposedly if you eat 1500 calories per day and you stick to it, you will lose 1 pound per week. How am I doing? Well, last week was pretty good, but often I find myself eating about 1800 calories when I have dinner at home, and 2000+ calories when I eat a meal or two in a restaurant. My action step right now is to work on shrinking my dinners and my restaurant meals to get in line with this goal. I am not worried about low-carb, low-fat, or any of the other philosophies out there. I read something where the  urlLink American Dietetic Association  stated that the only reason these things work is that they lower total calories consumed, and we really don’t know if certain types of foods make you more predisposed to gain weight or not. I recently bought a book on nutrition noted in the  urlLink Skinny Daily Post , and when I start reading it I will share with you my findings and my attempts to incorporate them into my lifestyle.  Second: I am cramming as much exercise as possible into my weeks. On Tuesday and Thursday mornings I work out for 1 hour with a personal trainer doing weights, resistance and cardio. Saturday mornings I just started a yoga class, and I also take a long walk in the morning usually at a nearby nature preserve.  Damn near every other weekday morning I do some form of cardio (walk on treadmill, row, swim, elliptical) for ½  hour. When I have time, I take a minimum 2 mile walk in the evenings in the areas around my neighborhood (3-4 times a week now that the weather’s good). Sundays I try and go to the gym for a full hour of cardio, but lately that has been sliding. Also, because I do not schedule a day of rest in there anywhere, I occasionally randomly skip the ½ hour of cardio in the morning in lieu of sleep. Lately thought I’ve been pretty good about walking in the evening when I skip the morning workout.   Wedding Update: Future Hubby and I neglected, yet again, to finalize the guest list for our October 9 wedding. Almost everything is set, but this crucial element eludes us for some reason. Once we get the guest list settled we can order invitations! Also on the horizon are engagement pictures and a notice in the paper.

      So it goes. I typed in a brief, friendly welcoming post to kick off my new blog, and it disappeared when I tried to publish it. This second time, I am typing it in Word first so that I will not have to retype it over again if it disappears a second time.   I have to give props to my friend  urlLink Dawnkeyotie  who is an online friend who first told me about her blog. I got hooked on reading her blog, then the customizable my.yahoo.com put a beta RSS feed on its site, and that’s when I came over to the dark side. I put political, library, and weight loss blogs in the RSS feed, and I have been addicted ever since. As a result, I thought it was about time that I started a blog of my own.   This blog will most likely be about my efforts to lose weight for my wedding in October but will probably also touch on other topics in my personal and professional life.  I hope you enjoy what I have to say, and I hope that you will comment frequently and provide feedback. That’s all for now, and I look forward to hearing from you!

      The third key in The Ultimate Weight Solution is controlling your external environment so that you limit the cues that trigger you to over eat. This means cleaning all the junk and binge food out of your kitchen, removing your “stash” from your purse, desk at work, or wherever else you stick away food.    Dr. Phil gives a lot of explanations on how to deal with the situation where the rest of your family eats this food; but this does not apply to me. Boo is happy to rid the house of anything I don’t want, and  the junky things he wants, maple patties, raspberry ice cream, is all icky to me and I don’t want it anyway.   He touches on dealing with the restaurant and fast food environment and basically says don’t fall prey to the “Super size” “Biggie” or other large portion promotions. We like to think that we are getting more for our money when we fall for one of these promotions, but we are doing ourselves a great disservice because the regular portion is probably already over and above what we ought to be eating.   For parties, and I tried this at the graduation party I went to last Sunday, you must drink diet sodas or club soda instead of alcohol, stand away from the food, and focus on conversations and people. This worked for me in that I did not eat as much as I ordinarily eat at a picnic, but I still ate more than I should have. Sometimes, when I was having conversations with Boo’s co-workers, I was fantasizing about the food. When this was happening, I tried to switch my thinking to formulating stimulating questions I could ask of the other people. This helped.  The last thing Dr Phil notes in this chapter is that you must get rid of your larger-sized clothes as you move to smaller sizes. That way you have no excuses when the smaller clothes start to not fit. You will be motivated to lose weight instead of buy new clothes. I don’t know if I believe this one, as when I was steadily gaining weight and had no larger clothes, I broke down and went out and bought some. But it is a nice theory.   Most of the external cues in my life are manageable. I don’t even watch the Food Network as much any more, because it can be considered a cue. Another important thing to realize is that stuff about diets and dieting is a cue. When I found this out, I realized, I need to think about other stuff as my day goes on and not obsess about what I am going to eat, how many calories, am I on track today, etc.  So I have certain limited times that I work on diet stuff, enough to keep me motivated, and then I don’t think about it the rest of the day. Now if I could just handle the restaurant/fast food/ party situations more reasonably, I would feel more in control and successful.

      Yesterday was the first day since 2 weeks ago that I was under 1500 calories. It didn’t feel like deprivation, I wanted to get back on track and was relieved when the numbers came out.   But again, today is Tuesday. I had a lower (120) calorie Lean Cuisine, because I know at 3:00 I will be having a snack to prepare me for my evening work. I would have the snack later, but in the summer the university’s Campus Center closes at 3pm. I squeak in at 2:45.   It is just very interesting, how much blogging and reading others’ blogs helps. It is much more effective for me than going to a Weight Watchers or Overeaters Anonymous meeting. And I have been to plenty of both of those, let me tell you. I think I have been actively trying to lose weight for 10 years – in and out of one program or another. And I always hated the meetings. I never felt very supported, and I never felt like I related to those people. Maybe the bloggers just talk about their weight loss struggles in a language I understand. Maybe because I can’t see them, I am not making judgments based on their appearance (as stated before I am a compulsive body-checker).  I am not sure what it is, but it is keeping me motivated.   Thanks, everybody!

      So my one doctor read an article that said one of my medicines could elevate certain things in your blood, so he ordered a triglyceride, cholesterol and glucose screening. He calls to tell me my triglycerides are elevated, he has notified my primary care person and the physician assistant should be calling me. I have a regularly scheduled appointment with this doctor a week later, and he does not change my medication, so apparently that is not the cause of the elevated levels. But the PA never calls. So finally I call that office and they say that yes, they do want me to come in.   So I go this morning. Triglycerides are 319 (319 what, I don’t know), the healthy level is 175, but they don’t start getting worried until they hit 500.  In addition, my cholesterol is 207 (again 207 what – not a clue), healthy level is 200, but they don’t start getting worried until it hits 210. Note the big difference in calibrating the two scores, there are 10 points of marginality in the cholesterol count, and hundreds of points of marginality in the triglycerides count.  So anyway, the short story, is that the PA tells me if I lower my cholesterol and my fat, the triglycerides will probably also come down. And she orders another damn blood test. The blood test is to establish a pattern, or to establish that the elevated levels were just a fluctuation.    She also gave me pamphlets on watching my fat. She didn’t really say to watch my sugar, which I read can elevate the triglycerides. But then again, she was more focused on the cholesterol, for whatever reason. So, its time to cut the sausages and fatty cheeses and focus more on choosing low fat foods. Now, the thing is, I don’t think I eat too much stuff that is super fatty; then again, I don’t pay much attention to fat grams in foods.   This whole go around gives me another big reason to lose weight. I am on track so far today-- the key to today will be scrounging a healthy dinner from what’s left in the cupboards, freezer and fridge. I’m not too worried.

      Graduation party today. My eating was bad. Counted calories and I am at 2300 for the day. Turns out if I had skipped either the hamburger OR the roast beef and turkey sandwich, I would be fine on calories today. But no, I had to try a little of everything. Not like I never had a hamburger or turkey and roast beef before.   Before I come down really hard on myself however, I do have to say I ate less than I would have eaten if I was just mindlessly shoveling in whatever I felt like eating. I skipped the chips and dip and only minimally had cheese, pepperoni, and crackers. And except for the extra sandwich, I only had one plate of food, and only one caloric beverage. And I skipped the cake because I don’t like crappy supermarket cake. And I documented what I ate and counted the calories. These are all good things. And tomorrow is another day.

      Dr. Phil’s second key is called “Healing Feelings”.  This is where you analyze your feelings about losing weight or gaining weight and try and trace back your reactions to deeper seated issues that may have affected you along the line. He wants you to identify the reactions you have to stressors and change those reactions to a more positive level.   I did the quiz and I am only a moderate emotional eater. This means I have a certain degree of emotional eating in my repertoire.  I personally know that when I am eating mindlessly, I am doing it for stimulation. Lonely and bored are my big snack attack triggers.  Dr. Phil talks a lot about stress, and a lot of it I have already worked on extensively. I had serious problems with stress and anxiety in the 1990’s that led to a serious bout with depression in 1996. Since that time, I have restructured my life (changed careers, overhauled my lifestyle) to eliminate whatever stress I could and manage the stress that I do have. Dr. Phil recommends yoga, deep relaxation and even guided imagery as tools to reduce stress. Well, you already know how I feel about the yoga.   I will let you know that I also have to do deep relaxation regularly, where you relax each part of your body, starting with the feet and working up to the head. You have to do this regularly so that you can recreate a body memory of deep relaxation to invoke when the anxiety hits. Also, just before I started the yoga, I started using a Taoist Healing Imagery tape for stress management that I had bought in 1996 after a successful experience with post-depression meditation, and that led me to buy a few other guided imagery CD’s which I use from time to time.  I try to use these when I am lonely or bored and they keep my mind focused, I feel refreshed afterwards, and best of all, I don’t start nosing around the cupboard and fridge.   The harder part is identifying the thoughts that run through your head –lightning fast reactions to stressors and triggers that make you resort to eating as a coping mechanism. I have been trying to figure out if my straying this past week has been a coping mechanism, and I think it is because I have gotten into too much of a routine and wanted some variety. But I can’t identify the lightning fast reactions that cause me to do this in the first place. This week, I am going to try and be more mindful of those things.

      I am finding myself slipping back into my old habits. Eating more junk, and just plain eating more. This week I have had 1700 – 2900 calories each day, and I was trying to keep the number around 1400.   So here are some reasons why I want to get fit and lose weight:   So I can go to Victoria’s Secret instead of   urlLink Big Girl’s Bras .  So I can buy clothes in any store, not just the 14-plus stores.   So I can walk up several flights of stairs and not feel like I’ve just run a marathon.  So I can walk down the aisle in October without feeling like a gigantic marshmallow.   So I will only have one chin.   So my old rings fit me.   So I can run a mile if I want to.   So I can fit into my fencing jacket, and maybe go back to lessons; hell, even compete.   So I can cut my risk factor for all those awful diseases that run in my family.   So I can get my new married life off to a healthy start, and keep on track for the rest of my days.

      As you may have noticed, I avoided weight loss topics yesterday. This was because I was feeling guilty for making a trip to the Burger King drive-thru Tuesday night. My plan backfired, which was to skip the big snack I have in the afternoon and have a little snack, and then just eat a regular meal when I got home. I was soooooo freaking hungry by the time I got out of work at 8:00pm, my car practically drove itself to BK. I didn’t feel like I could avoid it, there was no way I could talk myself out of going there (except, maybe driving up the road to McDonald’s). I hate this feeling, and I haven’t had it in a long time. Next week, I am sticking to the big snack / sushi plan.   So, just the other day, I was giving someone else who blogs a friendly reminder about the guilt cycle.  If you put “moral attachments” to your food (i.e., “good” food vs. “bad” food), and you have a “bad” food, you start to feel guilty. When you feel guilty, you subsequently restrict yourself until you feel deprived. When you are deprived, you set yourself up for another attack of eating “bad” food, which leads to more guilt, more deprivation, etc. You get the idea.  Well, I made a moral judgment about my Burger King attack. And yesterday I was feeling mighty guilty. So who really needs the reminder?   I need to accept as a fact that if I don’t eat 300 calories in the 3:00 – 4:00 pm hour on Tuesdays, I will be so hungry by the time I get off work, that Burger King will be teleporting me through it’s drive-thru. This is a fact, and it is neither good nor bad. I made a choice to eat a small snack in the afternoon and the consequence of that choice was that I was hungry later on. Nothing to feel guilty about, it is what it is. We must always work on our habits. I heard once that it takes 21 days to make a new behavior a habit, but I think it takes much, much longer than that.   The good news is that I weighed myself this morning and I have broken free of the 212-pound stagnation, and registered 210 on the gym scale! This was a needed boost, after I went to a certain doctor I see every three months, and during this most recent three month period I had only lost 5 pounds on his scale (the previous three months I had lost 12, which isn’t too shabby – a pound a week).  Then, in an effort to revive my motivation,  I went home and reviewed my food journal, and saw that my food had been pretty on target the past month with the exception of this week (starting with the hot dogs and potato salad last Saturday). So I was expecting a level readout. Now you know why I am feeling like a lot of this is up to chance! Whatever is working, I’ll take what I can get.

      Well, the invitations are ready and I have to pick them up. Hopefully there won’t be any errors.  We are still waiting for the sketches for our wedding bands, they should be ready any day now. I am going to my mom’s house last week of July – she’s making my dress and I will need another fitting.   Boo sent me roses on Monday to commemorate being engaged for one year. He is so thoughtful! Everyone at work thought it was my birthday.   Next week I meet with the rehearsal dinner restaurant to plan the buffet and get that organized.

      Well, I have been hovering around 212 pounds for several weeks now, despite being fairly rigorous on my food and despite continued exercise.  I thought you had to actually lose a lot of weight before getting to a plateau; I have only lost 13 pounds! Dr. Phil talks about identifying your locus of control when it comes to weight loss – do you feel you yourself have the most impact on your ability to lose weight (internal), or is your locus of control external – e.g., my mother keeps shoving seconds at me, or worst of all, do you believe it is up to chance. When I did the quizzes in the book last fall, I was strong on having an internal locus of control (believing the ability to lose weight rests within me) but I also had a high “chance” score as well. To be honest, I am starting to feel like that chance aspect is ringing true. The problem with having a “chance” inclination is that you are not likely to believe that anything you do will have a positive impact on your weight loss. If you lose weight, you are just “lucky”.  If you are heavy, that is just “fate”.    I just feel like the clock is ticking! I am trying my damndest to kind of rededicate, so that apathy doesn’t take over (and then the next time you see me I am at the Burger King drive-thru). As a result, I am not having a big snack before my late night working today. I am having a Pria bar (110 calories) and an ice coffee (with cream, no sugar, maybe 60 –80 calories).  With my left over Asian steak and noodles (Cooking Light recipe), I should be under with calories:   Breakfast: Yogurt ¾ cup 		135  All bran, ½ cup 	80 Strawberries ½ cup 	23 Coffee	 		40 Total: 			278  Lunch and snacks:  frozen dinner 	260 Pria bar	110 Ice coffee	80 Total:		450  Dinner Noodles/steak 	369  Grand total: 	1097  So, theoretically, I could even have some ice cream with Boo tonight after dinner. I’ll let you know how I make out.

      Its called “Right Thinking”, and this is where you take all the negative ideas you have about yourself and turn them into meaningful messages you can take with you and help yourself improve in terms of body image and self esteem.  You make a list of your thoughts both positive and negative, and then you try and work the negative ones into things that are going to help you, not berate you or alternatively, replace them with a healthy thought.   This is the one thing that I seriously worked on when I first read this book. I couldn’t think of positive thoughts to replace the negative ones, so I copied or modified the positive statements that Dr. Phil put in as examples. So now when I look at my naked body in the full length mirror after my shower, I try not to think about all the floppy parts, and instead think about the fact that I have a nice face, which is starting to look thinner, and pretty eyes, and decent calves, and so forth.  And then I tell myself the stuff that is floppy is improving. After all, I lost 2 inches around my belly from January to March.   One of the things this gets back to from the other book is the body-checking I told you about. That is where someone walks into a room and you immediately compare your body with theirs. This plays into the negative self-talk that is perpetually generated when you are feeling low from being overweight.   Although I am frustrated at my slow rate of weight loss (hovering around 212 right now), I still feel more positive than I did when I started, and so a little bit of success goes a long way toward establishing positive affirmations.

      This has been kind of a bad weekend for food. Well, Friday was good anyway. I reheated leftovers from a Cooking Light recipe.  But Saturday there were hotdogs and potato salad for lunch (610 calories) and then a party at night. And while I thought I ate reasonably (ham and turkey sandwich, maybe a cup of macaroni and cheese, 1 wedge of quesadilla, a mess of shrimp, strawberries, pineapple, two sesame cookies and two drinks) when I did the total estimate it came to 1900 calories just for the party, 2900 calories for the whole day. Yikes~!   And then today, well today was the one year anniversary of the day Boo proposed to me. It is hard to believe we have been engaged for a year already.  Ever the thoughtful one, Boo made me a big breakfast while I slept in (cheese omelet and hash browns, juice and coffee). If I had been awake I would have told him not to, as he told me on Friday that he had a surprise dinner reservation planned for us at 6pm today. To solve this problem, I decided not to count calories today. Actually we didn’t have lunch; we took a 2.5 mile walk (thank you pedometer) and then we went up north to see Boo’s parents for Father’s day.   Then it was off to  urlLink Paolo Lombardi’s , known for their delicious Italian food and ENORMOUS portions.  I had eaten there once before, years ago, and remembered how the portions were like for a family of four.  I had a hard time convincing Boo that the Mozzarella en Carozza (basically deep fried grilled cheese sandwiches) was enough of an appetizer for two of us, until he saw the dish come to our table. We considered eating only half the appetizer, but finished it anyway (four big slices, the size and shape of a big piece of cake). By the time we finished our salads, and waited the magic 20 minutes for our entrees, we were full. I got the All Premo which was shrimp, salmon and lobster in a lemon butter sauce over linguine. I don’t think I ate one third of my portion. Boo got the Veal Scallopine Oscar, veal with crab meat and asparagus in a brown wine sauce topped with hollandaise sauce. His was the tastier choice – “heaven on a fork,” but I was shooting for something light after the heavy appetizer. We skipped dessert and got cappuccinos.   The happy news is I have enough pasta left over for like 3 dinners, and I am not so full that all I feel like doing is going on the couch and watching television. I am even drinking water! I may even seduce Boo in a little while (sorry mom)! I really don’t want to know how many calories I had today, ‘cause dammit, I took a walk today and then I exercised self control at the restaurant and that’s success enough. Screw the scale!

      I am beginning to reread  urlLink The Ultimate Weight Solution: The Seven Keys to Weight Loss Freedom , which is the popular book by the ever-lovin’ Dr. Phil. Now, I read this most of the way through back last August and September when I was first starting to focus on losing weight for my wedding. For whatever reason, I lost my gumption on the exercise chapter. Needless to say, my weight loss efforts last fall were positive ( I had lost 10 pounds), but by the time the holidays hit, starting with my birthday in November, it was a slow downward spiral (or is that upward since it is a weight gain) to my starting weight of 225. In January (well at the end of December, really) I made a plan to do regular workouts and diary my food every day and I have stuck to it in a pretty regular fashion ever since.   So anyway, rereading the first couple of chapters of Dr. Phil, a few things strike me. First, he insists that his is the be-all end-all way to lose weight. He claims that he worked with severely overweight patients for eight years and had an eighty percent success rate in getting them down to a normal weight. All this using the “7 keys” which he describes briefly (the main part of the book is going into each key in depth). My reaction to this is a little bit like, “big whoop, Mister Self-Promotion.” At the same time, it makes me want to take the book seriously.   The second thing that was interesting, was the chapter on goal setting. Dr. Phil says you need to have specific goals, attribute specific feelings to those goals, and develop a specific plan for achieving those goals.  The interesting part of this was that I had already filled in these parts back when I read the book in August. I had a goal of losing 80 pounds for my wedding! Eighty pounds!! As you may be aware, I have lost something like 13 pounds with only four months to go till the big day. I was going to do this by walking 3 hours per week, ½ hour 6 days. Now, I exercise a lot more than this, and I do much more than walking. But at the time do you know how much walking I did? To my car and back, basically. The feelings I had were to be happy buying regular sized instead of plus sized clothes (still a goal), to be able to hike and fence (still a goal), and to be sexier (hadn’t thought of that one this time around, but I’ll take it!). I was going to eat 1500 calories per day and lose 6 pounds a month. Oh, to dream. I am losing 3-4 pounds per month, and I usually eat 1400-1600 calories.   It is just interesting to see how I didn’t stick to these original goals, in fact, I had totally forgotten about them. But somehow I formed new goals, and they are clearly in sight, which is what Dr. Phil says you need to do. Vividly imagine achieving your goals. Now if only I could knock off the pound I am up. 210 is only 3 pounds away!

      Here are a couple of links to articles I found really interesting on some of the weight loss blogs I read.    urlLink The Atkins Ornish South Beach Zone Diet   This article talks about the commonalities in all of the trendy diets and what it really means for people who want to eat healtfully.     urlLink The Obesity Epidemic Continues Unabated   This article states what we already know about obesity, it is a continually increasing problem in the U.S.     urlLink Media Shaming   Julie's post about how the media objectifies obese people and plays to the disgust of the viewer by showing clips of headless overweight people.

      You know, I couldn’t function on my program without my subscription to  urlLink Cooking Light  magazine. Now, mind you, I don’t read the articles in  Cooking Light . Back in the 1990’s the articles focused on nutrition and fitness, but lately I feel that the magazine has morphed into a generic “women’s” magazine, and I never went for that sort of thing (librarian-geek-girl reads  urlLink Harper’s  and the  urlLink Atlantic Monthly  for pleasure). But here is how I grocery shop: I pick 3 recipes out of the current issue of Cooking Light. Usually with leftovers, that is more than enough dinners to round out the week. Then I put all the ingredients on my shopping list, and then add stuff for breakfasts (yogurt, fruit and all bran) and lunches (smart ones and lean cuisines).   The recipes in  Cooking Light  are usually pretty straightforward and quick to make. They require kind of basic cooking skills. The recipes range in ethnicity from American to Asian to Cajun to you-name-it. So we never get bored. For instance last night was an Asian rice noodle dish with steak and vegetables, a couple of days ago it was pressed and grilled chipotle pulled-pork sandwiches with cole slaw. The meals satisfy my palate for exciting food, and they are all healthy and relatively low in calories. A nice feature of the recipes, besides the caloric and nutritional breakdown, is that they tell you exactly how much of something is a serving. For example 1 ½ cups of the asian noodles, or ½ cup of pork mixture  and 2 Tablespoons of sautéed onion with a slice of provolone and some pickle relish on the bun for the sandwiches. So if you do it right, you don’t mess up the portions, and you actually get six servings out of a six-serving recipe.  Granted, from time to time I will consult the internet or other cookbooks for interesting recipies, but without Cooking Light I would be lost.

      My brain is still catching up from missing two days of work, so I fear I haven’t had time to properly formulate a blog entry today. So I’ll, cop out and do a wedding update.   Boo and I went to  urlLink Mayfair Jewelers  yesterday to meet with the big honcho about getting custom rings. You see, my engagement ring is kind of unique (I am not skilled enough to post the picture, sorry)… It has what they call a knife edge running around the band, and then there is a princess cut (square) diamond weighing .5 karats in the middle, with 6 teensy weensy princess cut diamonds on each side. The setting is platinum and the band is white gold.   Anyway with the knife edge, and with my engagement ring being so wide, the normal wedding bands look funny with it. So, this appointment for custom rings went very efficiently. We explained to him that we wanted to mimic the knife edge (actually, we said “ridge” the jeweler told us it was a “knife edge”), and we wanted it to lay right with the engagement ring, and we wanted Boo’s ring to match as well. The guy said very quickly, we can do the knife edge, and we’ll put a single row of princess cut diamonds in it to mimic the engagement ring. He took a Polaroid of my engagement ring, and explained the process. Within a week, they will fax us sketches of the two rings, and we have to approve them or request changes. Then once they are approved, they will make wax ones, and we have to approve those. They will take my engagement ring for 10 days to line up the stones in both rings, and make sure they look right.  Finally we will have rings to try on and approve, and pay for.   Boo went to like, eight jewelers before he picked my engagement ring at this store, and he feels confident that they will do a good job on custom rings. I am willing to go over budget on them because, after all we are going to wear them for the rest of our lives!

      One of the things I have to learn to deal with in my quest to change my habits is to deal with changes to my regular routine. These past two days I have attended a communication seminar instead of going to work. (Well, yesterday I went to work in the evening after the seminar had ended for the day, but you get the idea). This meant no bringing a Lean Cuisine or a Smart One for lunch. Besides, work was paying for lunch, so why not eat at a local diner?   The other factor putting me off my routine, was that last night I didn’t sleep well because I was having nightmares. My solution to this in the morning was to sleep instead of going to the gym. For some reason when I got up later, I wasn’t hungry enough to eat breakfast. Big mistake. By 11:30 in the morning, I was sitting in that seminar thinking about nothing but lunch. I couldn’t wait to get to that diner. And when I got to the diner, I got a wrap (which comes with fries and soup) instead of like a salad or half a sandwich and cup of soup. The wrap was mayonnaise-laden crab meat salad to boot, not lean turkey or ham. I did a satiety check after I finished the first half of my wrap, and I was just starting to feel full. But then I rationalized that I could not put half a crab sandwich in the car for the rest of the seminar, because it would spoil, and I didn’t want to waste half a sandwich after paying $7.50 for the damn thing (forgetting it was work’s dime). And besides, I had skipped breakfast so I was  entitled  to the full sandwich. Halfway into the second half, I realized this was stupid, and I put the wrap down, and put my napkin over the top. Well, better late than never. Now if only I could have skipped out on some of the fries!   Life gets in the way of our best intentions, and no matter how you plan, something could go awry. You just have to learn discipline and how to make the right choices (would it really have been so bad to waste half a sandwich? I mean, I know people are starving in China and all, but I can’t mail them that crab meat wrap!). A big W-A-S-T-E is better than a big W-A-I-S-T, right? Its tough to fight 35 years of training to clean your plate, but I am willing to work on it.

      Well a couple of things happened to me yesterday that led me to hop off the fence in favor of having a rest day. The first thing is my dear, well intentioned, friend started nagging my by instant message to get my ass to the gym. Maybe for some people this would be motivating, but for me it put all kinds of pressure on me and when I feel pressured, my inclination is to resist at all costs.  The second thing that happened was, I fell asleep. Yes, I laid down on the couch to watch television for half an hour, and was woken up when Boo came home at 6:00pm.   Groggily, I made dinner. Then we were going to take a walk, and this was going to be my substitute for going to the gym. But something came up and we were reminded that we needed to get some groceries so that we could eat on Wednesday. So our walk turned into a trip to the supermarket.   But like  urlLink Metamorpheus  says, sometimes your best workout is after a rest day. This morning I had personal training, and the trainer made me do a mile as fast as I could. Now, bear in mind, I don’t RUN the mile, I WALK the mile, and it still gets my heart rate up. So I have a long way to go to being in shape. But the good news is I knocked a full minute off my one-mile time from the last time I walked it! A minute! That is like, huge! My trainer was pumped, and that almost was a better reward than my own self-satisfaction, because he is such a hard-ass.   The sad news was I was up a pound on the scale this morning. That is directly attributable to 2000 calorie days and then the “no counting” day of Sunday. Tuesdays are hard cause of the late night, but Wednesday I will definitely be back on track. How bad do I want it? Like my trainer always says to me: “October ninth, babe, October ninth!!!”

      This morning Boo came in and woke me up to go work out. But I had been up in the middle of the night with digestive trouble (stomach acid and emergency type poops) and so I was too tired to get to the gym. Plus my knees hurt, I guess yesterday’s hike was more taxing on them than I had thought. What happened to the old days when I used to bounce back from stuff like this and be all ready to go? I think I got old. Well, started to approach middle age, anyway. Sigh.   To get boo to stop bugging me about working out I told him I would go to the gym this evening. But now as evening draws ever nearer, I feel like… watching a movie, playing on the computer, eating dinner, and relaxing. One thing about the active weekend, I do not feel rested now that Monday’s here. Still, if I go to the gym for just a half an hour that will be enough to do some fat burning and not kill me. I don’t know, I am on the fence. I see in the other blogs and forums that even the most dedicated exercisers take a break day now and then. I just worry that one break day turns into two turns into a week, and before you know it, I am a couch potato again.   So we’ll see if I get to the gym later or I could just take a walk. Like I said, I am on the fence.

      Today was a very good day. It was in the mid 70’s and sunny. Boo and I decided to take a hike in the Adirondack Mountains. There is a hike I had been meaning to do, in fact we started it two years ago, and I had such pains in my calves that we couldn’t complete it. This hike goes into some ruins that are called the Paint Mines. They used to mine the orange-reddish dirt in the forest to make paint for barns and stuff, and there are still some old buildings and pits in the middle of the woods that you can explore.   The reason I had picked this hike two years ago, was that it was not climbing a steep mountain, but rather a walk into the woods. However, I discovered that this hike has a slowly upward slope, not unlike climbing some of the lower mountains in the Southern Adirondacks. I huffed and puffed, and stopped frequently. We saw two frogs (or were they toads?). I almost stepped on a snake. There was a beautiful view of Crane Mountain through the trees, the rocky cliff-like edifice towering above us in the sun. Then there were giant boulders, some 3 stories high – the guidebook mentioned them so we knew we were on the right track. Not far after the giant boulders was an old chimmeny – we had reached the Paint Mines.   The dirt sure was orange. I still couldn’t imagine painting a barn that color though, it still looked like dirt. There were some other areas where the building ruins still stood, and at least one pit where they mined the dirt. Boo and I sat and ate dried fruit and drank water. The hike back was much easier, although I got my foot stuck in the mud at one creek bed crossing.   Then it was on to Glens Falls to stop at Davidson Brothers. We had earned a beer. We drank to  my first completed hike since 1995 (Has it really been 9 years since I used to go up mountains?!). We had some bean dip, a few onion rings, and I had a buffalo chicken wrap while boo had the buffalo burger (his was buffalo meat, mine was the hot sauce on the chicken like the buffalo wings). We got  a sampler of the rest of the beers that were on tap, and so we were able to taste every beer they had.   I think I burned enough calories on the 4 mile hike, that I don’t need to count my food calories for the day. Now I am showered, and in comfy cool clothes, and cant’ wait to hit the sack – I am going to sleep like a baby tonight!  Wedding Update: We went to A.V. Costa yesterday, and they still had the invitations with the autumn leaf motif we had seen at a bridal show last November. The young woman was very helpful in making sure they invites were worded correctly, and everything was spelled right. That is why I wanted to go somewhere that provided service instead of one of the mail order companies.  They also had a large selection of wedding bands, and while they had some nice ones, nothing that struck Boo’s fancy. We are probably going to order custom bands from the jeweler where Boo bought the engagement ring. That appointment is Wednesday.

      Saturday, noon, and I am back from my yoga class. It was only my third yoga class but already I think EVERYBODY should be doing yoga. I am going to join the  urlLink Kripalu Center  and sign up for a class every 8 week session.   Right now I take a class called “Yoga for Round Bodies.” I must admit that at 211 pounds, I am probably the least round body in the class. I have to give these ladies credit, they are moving and stretching, and probably could not do a lot of the poses in a regular yoga class.  I find it challenging, but I think next session I am going to take a regular beginner yoga class and see how that works.   I don’t think if you just did yoga you would lose weight, your heart rate does not ever get up into that “fat burning zone” of 60 – 70% of your maximum heart rate. In fact, this yoga is much more relaxing than invigorating. I guess not all types of yoga are like this, I remember in college some women taking  urlLink Kundalini yoga  and when they would come out of a class their faces would be beet red and they would be sweatin’ up a storm. But even my Yoga for Weight Loss DVDs do not get the heart rate up.   For me, the yoga provides two important benefits: stretching out all my muscles, and stress reduction. I feel so good after yoga, it is like I just got a full body massage. I haven’t been taking it long enough to see improved flexibility, but I am hoping that will come in time. When I leave yoga, my body feels loose and relaxed, my head feels clear, and since I take it on a Saturday morning, I feel ready to tackle the weekend. During the class I actually feel a little silly sometimes, for example today we were supposed to pretend we were seaweed in the ocean – but I commit to the movements no matter how tricky or silly they seem to be, and it is all worth it when I come out of that class feeling more refreshed than after my best night of sleep ever. Like I said, everyone should do yoga!

      I did it. I finished the book last night. The final chapters dealt with body image and nutrition. As far as body image goes, they tell you to stop body-checking. This is when you walk into a room and assess everyone’s physique and compare it to yours. I happen to be a compulsive body checker. Even people I see every day, I every time I see them I am comparing my body to theirs. The authors suggest finding something about your body that you like and  remind yourself of that every time you have a negative thought about how you look. This stuff, too is in Dr. Phil’s book and it is addressed in a more doable way. I don’t know how to stop the body checking, I have been doing it ever since I started to put on weight back in the early 1990’s.   The last chapter was about nutrition. And here’s what I don’t get: after all these pages of telling you to eat what you want, whenever you want, they give x number of servings of grains, y number of servings of vegetables, etc. that you should have! I don’t get that at all; it doesn’t make any sense. Maybe they felt obligated because they are nutritionists.   The epilogue had a kind of FAQ about the Intuitive Eating program. One thing they answered to a question was in passing they mentioned you have to be willing  to give up your weight loss goals to do this program correctly. Well, kids, this program is not for me because there is no dagnammed  way I am giving up my weight loss goals before this wedding!  I also think this book would not sell well today, because we are starting to see what an  urlLink epidemic  obesity is becoming in the United States.

      Well, I finally got to the chapter on when to stop eating. “Respect your fullness” it says. Still, it acknowledges that many dieters don’t know when they are full until they are overly stuffed. Quite honestly, this is something I do not want to figure out by trial and error. I feel like by eating a certain number of calories per day I am learning to be full at a reasonable level.  urlLink Metamorpheus  has a twenty-minute rule, which helps with this. Since it takes a person twenty minutes from the time a person has eaten enough to the time he or she feels full, you time yourself after your meal is complete. If after the twenty minutes go by, you are still hungry, you can eat more. But most people find that they are not, in fact, hungry after the waiting period. This is extremely helpful if, like me, you eat too fast.   The other chapter I read was about emotional eating. This can be a bugaboo for me. For example the other day’s post wherein I identified being lonely because my fiancé was out of town, and when all my activities were done for the day, I ordered Chinese food and overate. Clearly boredom and loneliness are bugaboos for me, and I need to watch my eating extra carefully when these emotions set in. I recently read that sometimes people are more prone to over eat when they experience positive emotions such as celebrating or being around friends, or just being happy and feeling therefore “entitled” to overeat. I have to admit this has happened to me. After I get done with this book, I am going to reflect on the Dr. Phil book which goes into the issues surrounding emotional eating in more detail. (Hey I am a librarian, therefore partial to books!)   Intuitive Eating suggests keeping a mood journal along with your food diary. I am going to try this, writing down your mood and time of day when you eat a food. I may not agree with the authors’ proposal to give up dieting, but some of the other ideas have merit and should be explored.

      Not in too much of a blogging mood today. Going to get maintenance done on my car and during that time will read more of  Intuitive Eating , so maybe I will have a longer post tonight.   Non-scale victory today:  I am wearing my denim skort which I bought in 2001, and which I could not wear last year at all. There was some gut-sucking to get it on, but I am headed in the right direction!

      Last Thursday my trainer asked me if I was happy with my sessions with him, and I said: “Well, they seem kind of random.” He asked me a little bit about what I meant and I explained how I could not replicate a training session because I didn’t know what we were going to do from week to week. And how, some people have a set number of certain exercises that they are supposed to do, and it is predictable.   Well, he must have thought about this all weekend, because he came in today and started talking to me about circuit training. He says that because right now my goal is to lose the most weight I possibly can, he is doing a type of training that keeps you moving, and doing lots of different things to keep your heart rate up. He could have me power lifting, he said, but that would not burn as much fat as what he has been doing. He said I  could  replicate what we’ve been doing and he gave some examples. I said but I don’t see a logical progression. He told me rest assured, there is one.   He went on to explain the concept a little bit more, and now I have a better understanding of what I am doing and why I am doing it. I just wish he had explained this once he figured out a plan for me!

      So, I am half thinking of trying what this book says to do to remove the emotional and moral values of food. It says to make a list of your favorite foods, then circle the ones that you limit or forbid yourself. Then one by one eat as much of that food as you want over time until it is no longer some kind of special forbidden thing and you learn that you can have as much of it as you want.   I am thinking of doing this with Chinese take out because I would like to learn to eat a reasonable amount of it. But I fear that I will not learn and will instead go on a vegetable oil and sodium bloat. So I am not really committed to the idea, I don’t own it yet. I want to see how the rest of the book turns out before I start down this path. How many people do you know that read the first chapter of Atkins or South Beach and gained weight doing no-carb because they didn’t learn the whole process? Well, I know a few for sure.   Wedding Update: Tonight we go look at rings! I get my engagement ring inspected and cleaned so the warranty will still be good on it, and while we are at the jeweler’s we will pick out some wedding bands. I am so excited!!!!!

      Now, we get into some of the more interesting parts of the book. For example, the part about making peace with food, and removing the moral aspect to how you think about eating.   These two are related. Removing the moral aspect to eating is this: you are not “good” because you ate a salad or “bad” because you ate chocolate, these are merely food choices. And while we should guide our food choices by information about nutrition and what our body needs, there is no value judgement to be placed, no guilt that should be felt, when one eats a piece of cheesecake. It simply is what it is: a choice.  It is when you get overloaded with guilt that you cycle into deprivation, to the point where you can’t take it any more and you overeat, and then the guilt cycle starts again.   Making peace with food means that a peach and a chocolate bar generate the same level of emotional response. To be honest, I don’t understand how this works exactly, but I like the idea of it.   A person might not be so inclined to overeat if he or she didn’t assign value judgements to the food he or she eats. If the cheesecake and the peach factor evenly in your brain, then one slice of cheesecake might be satisfying. I am definitely not at this point, but I am willing to work on it.   Wedding Update: While I was at work today, Boo did up a spreadsheet and put his wedding guest list on it. I added mine when we got home. So the guest list is finally done. We both each have exactly 50 invitees. This week we are getting my engagement ring cleaned and “tuned up” so that the warranty will still be valid. While we do that we are going to look at wedding bands. This coming weekend, will make a trip to the wedding shop  urlLink A.V. Costa , and see if they still have the invitations I like with the leaf motif. Four months to go!!!

      Boo (a.k.a. Future Hubby) is away with his brother and father at a ham radio convention. They left yesterday afternoon and are expected back sometime tonight.  I have been spending time with friends to keep from missing him.   Last night, I was tempted to overeat, but I put in a DVD and got absorbed in that to distract myself from seeking food. This morning I had a healthy breakfast, went to yoga and had a sandwich for lunch. In the afternoon I went to an art festival with my friend.  I wore the pedometer – clocked in approximately 11,900 steps and 4.6 miles. My friend stayed for a visit for a while, but eventually she left. Then the bugaboos came and told me to order Chinese food for dinner.   Now, I love Chinese food. But I was careful about what I ordered: 2 teriyaki beef sticks, edamame (boiled Japanese soybeans) and House Chow Fun.  Chow fun, for the uninitiated, are wide flat noodles and they are prepared with meat like lo mein, except the shape of the noodles are different. I was more than half full after the beef sticks and the soybeans, but I still ate the chow fun past the point of fullness. And this gets back to yesterdays post. If I permit myself to eat whatever I want whenever I want, how am I ever going to lose weight? Isn’t that how I got fat?   When I have time to read another good chunk of the book, maybe it will all become clear….

      I am rereading a book that a dietician gave me in 2001 when I went to her to try and get on a weight loss program. It is called  urlLink Intuitive Eating . The dietician gave me lots of handouts and recommended this book, but was skimpy on the instructions for what to do and wanted to wait six weeks for the follow up appointment. I never made it to the follow up, but I did read most of the book. At the time, I thought it was interesting because it talked about patterns of unconscious and emotional eating, and gave you guidelines to eat “intuitively”. Although most of the way through the book, I had decided that all it said was: “eat when you’re hungry; stop when you’re full” and if I could do that, I wouldn’t need to lose weight in the first place.   I still have a problem with the book’s first premise: to “reject the diet mentality.” The diet mentality is where you deprive and deprive and deprive yourself either by limiting the amount of food you eat, or by prohibiting certain foods that you like because they will make you gain weight. What inevitably happens, is you “fall off the wagon”, overeat and gain all the weight back. The book says you should “honor your hunger.” The scary part about this idea is that I don’t trust myself to stop when I am full. The beginning of the book doesn’t even talk about stopping yet; it emphasizes not denying yourself and eating until you are satisfied. See, now I feel like you learn on a sensible diet to set those satiety points at a reasonable level. If you just ate completely unrestricted you would never learn to eat a healthy amount. Anyway, I am going to keep reading and post my reflections here. Maybe when I finish the book it will all make sense.   P.S. One interesting fact in the book: two cups of water weigh one pound. That is why you lose water weight so easily; it doesn’t take much of a water loss to show a loss of pounds.

      Well, today was my lucky day. The PT was late getting in this morning, so I had time to sneak on the scale without being harassed and harangued. Actually, I had planned on negotiating with him to get him to allow me to weigh myself the same day every week and stay off the scale the rest of the time, but I will save that for the next time the scale is calling my name. The verdict? The scale showed a one-pound loss, bringing me down to 212. I haven’t previous losses in the right hand column, because I had decided I was only going to update it every 5 pounds. So, 2 pounds to go for an update. The sad part is, my home scale was registering 210 on Monday, and I worry that yesterday’s egg roll binge upped my sodium intake and made me retain water. We’ll see what next Thursday’s gym weigh-in says.   Wedding Update:  Checked out Shea’s Restaurant (sorry no website) for our rehearsal dinner. The restaurant, billed as an Irish neighborhood pub, is close to the church and has banquet facilities. They have 2 simple, affordable buffet menus (more Italian and American than Irish!), and Boo and I both agreed on the slightly more expensive one with the fancier food. We had dinner there last night and the food and service were good. The banquet room is a bit plainer than I would like, but it all other criteria considered, it is just fine for our purposes. We penciled in for the 8th of October, and I will make a follow-up call with the owner tomorrow.

      I knew I could sleep in this morning because I had the afternoon off and could go to the gym then. I didn’t have any appointments and only one errand (take Boo’s shirts to the dry cleaner – he thinks because he wears undershirts that the top shirts never need laundering – ugh!).  I went to the gym for an hour, and I am going to try going for an hour every time I go starting this month. Still I can only manage about 15 minutes on the arc trainer, so I spent 45 on the treadmill. I got one of the good treadmills with the little televisions on them but I forgot my headphones so that was a bust. Nonetheless I did 2.4 miles in 45 minutes. Would like to get that number closer to three miles. I pushed myself a little bit, but was kind of a slug at the end.  Did some mindless eating today, 3 egg rolls~ cold~! 510 calories. Luckily dinner is eggplant stew – 324 calories.   It seems like lately I am all about counting: nine minutes left at 3.8 miles per hour…  three egg rolls at 510 calories...1400 calories per day to consume,  60 minutes of cardio three times a week…. 2000 Meters in 12 minutes, etc. etc. etc.   But if I didn’t have metrics I guess I wouldn’t know how I am progressing (or how much of a slug I am being!)  I just yearn for the day I get on one of those machines and don’t have to psych myself up with “500 Meters to go,” or “3 more minutes at this speed,” or “10 seconds – 9 – 8 – 7, etc.” to get through the workout.

      Well, there were good points and bad points to my food and fitness this weekend. The good points were: we walked all day Saturday and Sunday and took a one hour hike on Monday; I have learned my lesson about only eating one sausage; the yogurt-bran muffins were a hit; the portions at the Vietnamese place were very small. The bad points: cheese and crackers at 10pm; “trendy place” in MA on Saturday turned out to be an Indian buffet – no salad option; no one-egg breakfast or oatmeal available at café for Sunday brunch; I have not learned my lesson about eating half a burger; skipped yoga class.   Nonetheless, and I hesitate to say this without weighing myself on the gym scale, I seem to have lost weight even after such a tumultuous week. Now, I don’t know when I am going to get to weigh myself on the gym scale, because my silly personal trainer has it in his head that I only need to weigh myself every three to four weeks, and he yells and makes a big embarrassing stink if he sees me on the scale more frequently than that. So I have to be sneaky and weigh myself when he’s busy with another client or otherwise not looking in my direction. So, I’ll keep you posted once I can sneak on the scale at the gym.   I did get back into my good habits rather easily. On Monday night I was RELIEVED to be cooking something healthy at home instead of going out again. Previously, I would get on a “roll” of eating out and it would just make me want to eat out more. Also, I was feeling a little down about not having stuck to my plan of attack, and so I got right back to journaling my food on Monday after my friends had left. On the television Monday afternoon was a  urlLink Buff Brides  marathon – I watched several episodes and couldn’t wait to get back into the gym this morning.   All is well, and will hopefully be even better if I can sneak onto that scale this week!

      Well, I got some sad news Thursday night. Boo's mom has deteriorated to the point where she thinks she is going to choke if she swallows a pill. She is withdrawn and not very coherent. Boo felt he couldn't come to my parents for the weekend, and stayed home while I made the drive alone. I am very sad, but it was clear that his dad wanted him in town in case anything happens.  After lunch, I am going to try on my dress as my mom has made it so far. She made a sample of what the top is going to look like (opaque fabric with a lace overlay) so that I could give it to Boo's mom.  I am going to try to give it to her, but I don't know if she will be able to register what it is or what it looks like. I felt so depressed when I looked at the dress as my mom showed it to me. It looks positively ENORMOUS. Sigh.  The rest of this weekend is trying to deal with the different food in the house and different schedule. I already biffed, as I was hungry at 6:00pm and the rest stop store was closed, but the McDonalds was open. Mc Nuggets and fries down the gullet only to be followed by a proper dinner 2 hours later when I got to my parents house.  This morning I had some coffee, and was getting ready to go for a walk, and my dad offered bacon and eggs, which I turned down. But when I got back from my walk I was starving, and had a banana and two slices of sourdough bread. I have been snacking since then on leftover vegetables in the house. Grilled squash and green beans to be specific. Now my dad is making bratwurst that I gave him for his birthday for lunch. I told him I only wanted one, but I am hungry enough for 2 (trying to stick to the single sausage rule). For dinner I am meeting an oldy moldy friend and his girlfriend. I originally wanted to go to a restaraunt known for its  urlLink Beef on Weck , but without Boo here it won't be the same. The whole point was to show Boo another great thing about  my hometown.  So I don't know where we are going to dinner, I only know I have to wear my "nice" clothes that I brought. I am sure it will be good, but will I be good is the question? Something like 2 months and 1 week to go, I cant afford NOT to be good.

      This morning was training day, and every three months the trainer takes my measurements to see how I am doing. It is another form of metrics besides weight loss to see how I am progressing.   The good news is: since January, I have lost 6.75 inches off my waist, and 3 inches off my thighs. I have lost about 1 inch on calves, upper arms, and forearms, and actually GAINED an inch in the boob area.  The bad news is my percent of body fat has only gone from 43% to 41%. It would make me really happy to lower that to like 30%.   The trainer has decided that I have not lost enough weight in 6 months, so he is suspending working with weights, and decided today to do an all-cardio session. He put me in this giant rubber band thing and made pull him around the gym like I was a horse and he was the buggy. He put me on a wobbly board thing and made me do stretchy exercises on it with a medicine ball. Oh and the stairs, the stairs.  12 times up and down the stairs, every other time up: two steps at a time.  You get the idea. I guess this is what I can expect for the next month, is what he was saying.  Have I mentioned that he is an ex-Marine?   He started again with the diet advice, this time advocating South Beach or Atkins. He told me to at least buy an Atkins-approved cookbook.  Refined carbs are tough to get rid of though. They’re everywhere. He argues that 1700 calories is fine and all, but it also matters what kind of food you put into your gullet as well (1700 calories of french-fries being worse than 1700 calories of protein, for example).  I have a book on nutrition that I am going to dive into after I finish Dr. Phil.  I am dubious on the South Beach/Atkins thing because I think they are fad diets. But buying a cookbook and making a few meals a week in that style certainly wouldn’t hurt.   Tomorrow I am going to my parents’ house across the state, so my mom can work on my wedding dress, and we can visit with them and my oldy moldy friends.  I will have computer access, but with my schedule being off whack, I don’t know if/when I will be posting. I’ll probably squeeze at least one in over the weekend, and you will definitely hear from me on Monday.

      I did NOT want to go to the gym this morning. I had slept really badly and felt I needed the extra snooze time. “I am so disappointed and I want to be PROUD of you” Boo said, shaking my shoulder in an effort to rouse me from my slumber. “Fuck you I am sleeping,” I thought to myself as I ignored him, but now his words resonate in my head and I feel GUILTY.&nbsp; And there is no way I can get back the time I used to sleep this morning. Its gone. So I should just move on. Learn, but move on. (Now if Boo had reminded me that I could drink my water out of one of my new Nalgene bottles, I might have gotten up!)  In other exciting news, tonight Boo and I go to register for our wedding schwag. We weren’t going to register for much, but then a recently married couple advised us to register for crap we want otherwise we’ll get a bunch of crap we don’t want. So we are going to register for stuff like a tv for the bedroom and a digital camera, in addition to the fine china. Screw the sheets and towels. You see, Boo already owned a home and I had lived on my own before moving in with him, so we have tons of household stuff.   Oh did I mention? I weighed myself Tuesday, and was down 2 pounds to 207 – progress is progress! Tomorrow I do the measurements with my trainer so we can see how many inches I have lost, and how many more crunches I can do, etc. Last time I did this (April) it was super exciting and motivating. We’ll see how I do this round.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

          The sixth key is exercise, and I had thought I was doing pretty good on this one, and I was right.&nbsp; Reading this chapter, Dr. Phil says we need 2-3 hours of moderate activity (walking for pleasure, housework, etc.) and 2-3 hours of intense activity (more strenuous exercise) per week.&nbsp; If working with the trainer counts as the strenuous activity, that’s two hours a week.&nbsp; A half an hour of cardio minimum on&nbsp; M – W – F is 1 ½ hours plus 1 ½ hours of yoga, plus ½ hour to an hour on Sunday is at least 3 ½ hours of moderate activity.   Dr. Phil tells a story of a woman who started walking and it caused her a lot of pain. Her thighs got chafed and she was winded, and generally miserable. But she kept up with it and now it is easier.&nbsp; This is kind of what has happened to me. Last year Boo and I would take walks and I would get winded and sweaty and he was always having to slow down so that I could catch up. Now, we walk as far as we want for as long as we want, sometimes up to 5 miles!  He also points out that we need to monitor how we are doing. He recommends a heart rate monitor to assure that you are working out at the proper intensity.&nbsp; To find out your target heart rate, take your age and subtract it from 220. (For me, 220 – 35 = 185 beats per minute). That is your maximum heart rate. Your target heart rate is 75 % of the maximum (for me 185 X .75 =&nbsp; approx. 139 beats per minute). I am really glad I bought that mp3 player with the heart rate monitor on it because I have been suspecting that especially on my cardio days, my heart rate does not get into this range any more. Other things to monitor he suggests keeping a log of how many miles you walk and stuff like that. Put it into a spreadsheet and chart your progress (yeah, right, sure).   So, for me this key needs a little fine-tuning to be sure I am making the most out of my workout time.&nbsp; Only one more key to go!  P.S. I forgot to tell you about the dream I had Sunday night. I dreamt it was my wedding day, and I went to put on the dress and it was TWELVE INCHES too big in the waist. I had to wear another dress to get married in, it was a maroon and cream affair, very fancy but not a wedding dress. Boo was wearing one of the two suits he owns, and we rode off in a white carriage with white horses.&nbsp; Now, I don’t think I will be swimming in my dress, but it was a nice thought. If&nbsp; Boo wore his suit instead of the tux, I would kill him!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

          Here is my plan of attack for tonight when Boo is up at his mom’s house.&nbsp; As you may recall he is going there directly from work because he doesn’t want to wait the hour for me to get home and then the time it takes to make and eat dinner. He hopes in this way he will be home earlier because he is exhausted.&nbsp; Being home alone is risky for me, because I tend to eat away my loneliness and boredom.   First, I did not go to the gym this morning, and so I packed my bag with gym clothes so I can go directly after my afternoon job. The gym is on the way home so it made the most sense to do it this way.&nbsp; This will take a half an hour to an hour, depending on how motivated I am. I brought my walkman, so that should help.&nbsp; Am sort of wishing that I brought a swimsuit instead, because it seems the time goes faster when I swim. But I think I need to get my heart rate up faster than when I swim ( I swim breast stroke because crawl makes me get water up my nose and ears).&nbsp; I am also going to read a chapater of Dr. Phil. Dinner is a quick reheat of couscous with chicken, peppers, onions and beans.&nbsp; For the rest of the evening, I think I am going to try to work on some creative writing and make progress in the recreational book I am reading (the Illiad – am I a geek or what).   In other exciting news I bought this  urlLink mp3 player . It has a heart rate monitor and calorie counter on it.&nbsp; This makes it better for me than the ipod I have been lusting after. But I have decided it will be my 200 pound reward. I cannot use it until I get down to 200 pounds. I hope this will help me break out of my plateau, I have been 209 – 210 for a month now.&nbsp; Writing that has made me motivated to really chug it out at the gym tonight. I hope that motivation stays with me by 5:30pm!

      Well the weekend has had its ups and downs. Yesterday we did a lot of cleaning (bathroom, kitchen, living room, windows).&nbsp; Boo rested a bit – he’s exhausted from spending time with his mom. We took a 2.5 mile walk after dinner, and then settled in and watched the Triplets of Bellville.   This morning I woke up with a sinus headache, so I took some Sudafed and ibuprophin and went to sleep in the living room. We went to the gym, where I swam for 45 minutes, and Boo worked out on the elliptical. Then we went out for breakfast (goat cheese and green onion omelet, home fries, and curry almond honey bread toast) and picked up some soups for his family and a cookie for my Gramma. We then visited my Gramma for a little while (she just moved into new digs with more care), and then it was on to Boo’s parents house. We stayed there quite a while and Boo helped out while his dad took a nap. Then we went to a diner for dinner (chef’s salad and sinful ranch).&nbsp; Now we are home and damn I am pooped.   Boo wants to go to see his mom right after work tomorrow, and since I get out later than he does, I will have the evening to myself. I am trying to think of things to keep me occupied so that I don’t eat the night away. I have laundry to put away, that’s one thing, and Dr. Phil to read, that’s another. Then again it may be nice just to go bleaaaaaaaaagh and lay like a slug in front of the tv. I’ll let you know how I make out.&nbsp;

      The fifth key in the  urlLink Ultimate Weight&nbsp;Solution  is proper nutrition. He divides food into “High response cost – high yield” foods and “Low response cost – low yield” foods.&nbsp; Response cost has to do with how much effort it takes you to ingest the food.&nbsp; A high response cost food is something like, raw broccoli, which takes a lot of chewing, or sunflower seeds in the shell, which you must crack open and remove the seed before eating, or soup which just takes a long time to eat.&nbsp; The example Dr. Phil gives for a low response cost food is a bean and sour cream burrito, which you barely have to chew and it slithers down your throat. Yield is kind of like the ratio of nutrition to calories in a given food. A high yield food has a lot of nutrition for low calories, and a low yield food has a lot of calories for no nutrition.   Needless to say, the high yield high response foods are stuff like raw vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Low response low yield foods are quarter pounders, fruit roll-ups and refined carbs.&nbsp; Dr. Phil provides a map for how you are supposed to eat: divide up your plate into 4 quarters. In one quarter put the lean meat, in another quarter put your serving of whole grains, and in the other two put a fruit and a vegetable or two vegetables.&nbsp; Now this is all hunky dory, but I find my eating is just not that organized. And if I a plate full of food like that for every meal plus two snacks as he advocates, I would be having even more trouble losing weight than I already am.   He also talks about meal replacement bars and drinks. He says they are necessary to have when you want something quick, in lieu of processed crap or fast food. But only occasionally.&nbsp; He said something like less than half the carbs should be from sugar and they should be no more than 230 calories, and they should have vitamins, minerals and protein.&nbsp; I sometimes bring these for snacks, the Pria bars, and I will have to look at the label to see how they stack up. I do know they are only 110 calories.   All in all this wasn’t a great chapter for me. I took the nutritional assessments, and with the exception of too much caffeine and two little whole grains and dairy, I am doing pretty good in the balanced diet department. And I have improved since I first went through this book – I have made it a point to pay more attention to fiber and caffeine and salt, so I scored better on a lot of things.&nbsp; The next chapter is where I got stalled last time reading this and it is on exercise. Since I am doing so much better on exercise, I think this chapter will be a breeze as well.&nbsp;

          It is misting and humid out, swamp weather.&nbsp; Maybe it was the humidity that made me blow off working out this morning.&nbsp; Maybe I just needed the extra sleep. I don’t know, I just know that it seemed better to let it slide than to force myself and wind up hating working out. Then again, maybe if I went I would have gotten into a groove and enjoyed it anyway.&nbsp; Diligence and persistence have to be my mantras the next couple of months.&nbsp; I am going to try and exercise every day until my wedding.  So I bought some  urlLink Nalgene  bottles online today. Currently we reuse those clear plastic water bottles you get from Dasani or Aquafina, but I read recently that they are only meant to be used once. You can refill them one or two times, but after that the harmful chemicals from the plastic starts to leach into your drink. Yikes. I read in the newspaper the other day that Nalgene bottles are “the best”, and while I think any bottle would do, these are kinda cool.&nbsp; Started with 4, maybe buy more in a couple of months. Since I also read recently that bottled water is no better for you than tap water, and tap water usually is also fluoridated while the spring water is not, I no longer worry about taking the water from my sink and putting it in the fridge. So Nalgene bottles filled with tap water it is.   Nothing much else going on, we  urlLink register  for our wedding gifts on Wednesday night. That will either be really fun or a nightmare. This evening we are going to get a  urlLink Smithwick’s Irish Ale  after we get back from the hospital. And of course, tomorrow morning,  urlLink Yoga . With all the stuff that’s going on, yoga will be a welcome break.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

          Wedding stuff is starting to pick up again. I will have to schedule appointments in September with nearly everyone that I made arrangements with last year for our wedding to confirm everything and make sure it is handled properly.&nbsp; (Note to self: remember to ask Boo to notify the organist that sister will be in town for shower and able to practice the music at that time.)  &nbsp;  Well, I weighed myself today and I was down about a half a pound, which, although it isn’t much, is progressing in the right direction.&nbsp; I am going to have to be exceptionally diligent these next coming weeks if I want to get down to my goal weight.&nbsp; I have some good habits, like writing my food down and calculating or estimating the calories.&nbsp; (By the way,  urlLink The Complete&nbsp;Book of Food Counts  by Corrine T. Netzer is a good source for nutritional information on almost any food you can think of.)  &nbsp;  I have been good about fixing quick dinners these past couple of days so that we can spend more time in the hospital with Boo’s mom. It turns out she gets out of the hospital and then hospice care takes over at her home on Friday.&nbsp; Hospice will provide her with a hospital bed, walker, wheelchair, commode, home health aide for personal care, shower chair and other necessities that she will want as she continues to get weaker. The good news was yesterday she was eating solid food again. Well not really eating -- more like nibbling -- but its better than when she couldn’t get down a Popsicle.&nbsp; She kept dozing off in the middle of sentences from the morphine, and then every time we thought she was down for the count, she would lift her head and continue right where she left off.&nbsp; Except for the dozing, she was her usual talkative self.&nbsp; Thanks to all of you who have sent prayers and good vibes and general well wishes to me and Boo’s family.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well as you know, I haven’t been making my usual Cooking Light meals, and have been eating out because “life gets in the way”. &nbsp;But I have been writing down my estimated calories, and since Sunday, I haven’t been doing too bad, actually, about 1300 -1700 calories per day. &nbsp;And I have exercised every day except Monday when I had to go to that librarian meeting out of town.  &nbsp;   urlLink Trish  points out the fact that if you reduce or burn 3500 calories in a week you will lose a pound. I am hoping for a loss, because I have been stuck for several weeks at the same weight. And the fact that I have been on track without concentrating on being on track makes me VERY VERY happy.  &nbsp;  Back to the hospital to visit Boo’s mom tonight. She’ll be there until Friday.

          I thought things would calm down after this weekend, but I had an all day meeting out of town on Monday, and they brought in sandwiches and chips. Then I got home and only had a short time to go through email before Boo arrived and told me he wanted to go back to the hospital to visit his mom. We grabbed baked potatoes and chili at Wendy’s to speed this along.  &nbsp;  As you know Tuesday is my tricky day, and I went to the Campus Center early to see if there was a better choice of fare when more things were open. I wound up getting oil covered spaghetti with sauce and meatballs – I ordered it before I saw the pile of pasta glistening in the light from its oil coating. Of course I ate it anyway. Well, I should be full, and as I am going for another cholesterol test in the morning I can’t eat when I get home tonight anyway.  &nbsp;  Not much else exciting, haven’t had time for the Dr. Phil book but I promise I will get back to it as soon as I can. Boo’s mom is doing a little better now that she is hydrated, but she is on so much morphine that she is not very lucid. We’re all praying for her.

      Sorry I didn’t write yesterday. It was a long day. First I had yoga in the morning, then we went to that picnic. Stayed at the picnic for lunch AND dinner.&nbsp; This year they did not have dogs and burgs and potato salad. They had Italian sausage and peppers, big torpedo rolls from a bakery, baked ziti, and salad. It wouldn’t have been bad except that I had two helpings of everything since we ate at noon and at 6.&nbsp; Oh, and no diet soda, no bottled water! I was so annoyed.&nbsp; I had one glass of sugar soda and I discovered I no longer like sugar soda. So I kept running inside to the sink to get tap water. The hostess never seemed to notice.&nbsp; Then again most guests were drinking beer.  &nbsp;  At 6 we went to see Boo’s Mom and Dad. When we got there, his dad was on the phone to his mom’s doctor. He asked Boo to help him walk his mom out to the car so they could take her to the hospital. She was really out of it, really weak and hadn’t had anything to eat or drink all day. We were at the hospital till 10pm and they still hadn’t gotten a room for her out of the ER. Boo’s dad stayed till 1am he told us today.&nbsp; We got over to the hospital today around 4pm, and his mom was still fading in and out of consciousness. It is so sad to see how suddenly weakened she has become. Boo and I are planning on cooking some meals for his dad and bringing them up later this week.  &nbsp;  This morning I did swim for 45 minutes and that felt good. Tomorrow I won’t work out in the morning because I have a business trip and have to meet my colleague at 7:30 AM. Ugh. I am hoping I get home early enough to either take a walk if it is not raining, or maybe put in ½ hour at the gym. Of course this may all be out the window if Boo wants to go visit his mom again.&nbsp; &nbsp;

          &nbsp;  Well, I looked at my calendar this morning, and guess what. I have plans tonight to take my friend out for her fortieth birthday. You see, she is having a really big party to celebrate, but I will be out of town on that day. So, I wanted to do it up big.&nbsp; I am taking her to Elda’s which is a fancy Italian type restaurant in the trendy section of downtown (sorry, no web page). You know, the kind where you have to make reservations way in advance. Which is why I had forgotten about this event.  &nbsp;  Ordinarily this wouldn’t really bother me, but I am till feeling the sting of the trainer’s rant yesterday. I considered canceling, but I really, really, want to celebrate my friend’s big 4 –0 in style. She has really helped me out in dire moments in my past – for example, letting me move in with her temporarily when I lost my job. She really deserves this, and she doesn’t get to fancy restaurants very often.  &nbsp;  This is how life gets in the way of one’s best intentions. I once read an article by a former chef “exposing” the secrets of fine dining establishments and he said, there is probably an entire stick of butter in your food by the time it gets to your table. The last time I went to this place was with Boo a couple of years ago, and we got the chateaubriand. I swear it was the best red meat I have ever had in my life.  &nbsp;  In addition, Boo informs me that his  urlLink fraternal organization  is having a picnic on Saturday. Last year the fare at this picnic was hotdogs, hamburgers, and mayonnaise based salads, along with chips and dip. Life is getting in the way!  &nbsp;  I would like to tell you what my strategy will be, but the best I can come up with right now is that I am going to watch the portions as best as I can. I would like to say I will not have a drink or an appetizer or dessert at Elda’s but you know how celebrations can be. Maybe I can talk my friend into splitting the ap and dessert and get a glass of wine instead of a cosmopolitan?&nbsp; And for the picnic, it is totally about portions, and focusing on talking to all those Hibernians instead of loitering&nbsp; by the food table (although the prospect of getting into a debate with some of the&nbsp; older, devoutly Irish Catholic men about abortion is a bit frightening).&nbsp; Another thing I can do is squeeze in an hour walk on Saturday after yoga, and make sure I get to the gym for swimming or an hour of indoor cardio on Sunday.&nbsp; Yes, I will do these things, and I will be back on track on Sunday. It’s all good!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      So my trainer this morning casually asked me, “How you doing on food these days?” and stupid me, I answered him honestly. I told him that I had eaten at least one meal in a restaurant every day last week. He flipped out on me. I tried to defend myself, telling him I had to live, and telling him I had traveled for part of the time. He would hear none of it. As far as the traveling went, he was adamant that I should have cut up a bunch of fresh vegetables and packed them for the trip. Now that may be right, and maybe I didn’t make the best choices every restaurant meal, but I am NOT going to let him make me feel low and guilty because of it. It happened, now I am moving on. In fact, Tuesday and Wednesday I was right on target.   As much as I hated Weight Watchers, this is the one thing I got from my years in their program: life happens, and we can’t always eat perfectly. The key is to get back on track as soon as possible and to learn from one’s mistakes. And like the Intuitive Eating book pointed out, if you become a mass of guilt you are actually setting yourself for the deprivation – binge – guilt cycle all over again. I am not going to let this happen. I am up a pound and that is the factual result of my overeating. I was not “bad”, I just ate too much.   What I am trying to do with my trainer’s rant this morning is to take it and turn it into motivating myself to think: “what can I do now and in the future to ensure that I do not overeat?”  I am not, as he suggested, going on the “raw foods” diet. That is a big fad diet out right now and I will not succumb to fad diets. I think I told you guys when I first started this blog, best way to lose weight according to the  urlLink National Dietetic Association  is to eat “high volume, nutrient dense but not calorie dense foods” and learn to let your regular feelings of hunger and satiety guide you from there. They suggest a 500 to 1,000 calorie reduction through either eating or exercising to successfully lose weight.  The only reason the “raw foods diet” would work is because all of those criteria are met. But there are ways to meet that criteria and cook your food as well. I plan on getting more involved with nutrition in the next book I have on deck to read (will she EVER finish Dr. Phil?), so I will provide more on that later.   In the meantime, its just as simple and just as hard as getting back on track. I seem to be managing.

      I don’t really have a good theme, I haven’t had a chance to pick up Dr. Phil lately, so I guess I will just tell you about my day so far.   I woke up this morning, and decided to save the gym for the afternoon.  This after yesterday I promised myself to get the gym out of the way in the morning so that I would have the afternoon free and not be crunched for time. Somehow in the morning, that seemed less important.   I slept in, and Boo called me at 8am to wake me up to get ready for work. Work was busy because I hadn’t been there since Thursday. Lots of  interlibrary loan requests and journals to check in. Wednesday afternoons I do not work my second job, so it was off to lunch and to the car dealership.   I had a ½ hour to kill before my appointment for the car, so I went to a  urlLink diner  for lunch. I got a chicken Caesar salad, and was disappointed that they poured the dressing over the lettuce like you would do a regular salad and didn’t toss it with the lettuce. There must have been a quarter of a cup of dressing on there - UGH, and probably 6 – 8 oz chicken. I am trying to stick with my goal of leaving some food on my plate, so I left a bunch of lettuce.   Off to the dealer. My door to my gas cap was stuck, and they just did some quick thing to it and didn’t charge me. And they washed the car. God, I love  urlLink Saturn .   Got home and quick changed for the gym. I had wanted to swim, but there was rain so the outdoor pool would be closed. I walked at 3.6 for a half an hour, then 3.0 – 3.5 for another half hour, finishing the hour having walked a total of 3.3 miles. Not my best effort, but still a good showing for sticking out the hour.   Now I have to make a grocery list and I think we are going to go see  urlLink Fountains of Wayne  at an outdoor concert tonight.  First, I will hit the shower because I am disgusting and sweaty. Was that too much information?

      Well, I had my four days of lots of  urlLink music , sitting still in a concert venue, camping, and generally not exercising. I averaged 2300 calories per day, thanks in part to some bad planning on the food we had brought (400 calorie muffins, 200 calorie frappuccinos to substitute for coffee in the morning), and partially due to bad choices for dinner at the restaurants (fish fry, big hamburger with bacon and cheese). Nonetheless I weighed myself at the gym this morning and was only up a half a pound. Now I was up a half a pound last week, so I am back at 210.   But I really don’t feel so bad, because I LOOK thinner, and my close are fitting looser. So maybe I am turning some fat into muscle. Next time I will make more careful food choices for what we pack (granola bars instead of muffins and maybe mix up a couple of thermoses of my own ice coffee).   One thing I am disappointed about, I tried an exercise in will power that did not work. Specifically I ordered a half pound burger with bacon and cheese, telling myself I would only eat half. Well let me tell you that first half was gone very fast (so much for slowing down my eating).That second half just looked so lonely and forlorn on the plate, I took a couple of bites, then a couple more. Then I put the last bit on the plate and it fell apart. Boo was waiting for a beer and I kept looking at it, but told myself not to eat it and just leave it there. But I wound up using a fork and picking the meat out of the disassembled sandwich remains. I guess I am better off ordering something healthy and polishing it off at a restaurant than trying to portion out the bad stuff. Anyway my goal for the week is to leave a little bit of food at the end of every meal so I can condition myself away from the “clean plate club.”

      Well, I have been trying – sort of. This week starting with the holiday weekend, when I stopped keeping my food log, has turned into a restaurant fest. Diner for breakfast and Outback Steak House for dinner Monday, Tuesday, take-out turkey sandwich for lunch and take-out Chinese for dinner, Yesterday, crabmeat wrap at a diner for lunch, and antipasto and (worst of all) hot wings (to some of you they are maybe “Buffalo” wings, but having been raised in that fair city I learned to call them hot wings) at a little Italian place for dinner last night.   And we are going away for a long weekend tomorrow. You know what that means  - more restaurants.  We are camping, but we are also going to be attending a  urlLink music festival  all day Saturday and Sunday. I insisted that we bring food for breakfasts and lunches.  It was all I could do to hold back Boo at the grocery store last night from buying too damn many snacks like we had done for the 4th of July.   Both Boo and I have noticed that our stomachs are not appreciating all the crap we’ve been eating of late – the wings were the kicker that made me  say “No More Crap”. But you know how easy it is to slide into bad habits, this morning I was going to skip breakfast at home and swing through the drive-through on the way to work. But I stopped and thought about it, and then got out my yogurt and strawberries and had a healthy breakfast at home.   To make matters worse my trainer kind of read me the riot act about not losing more weight. He thinks I should be losing weight faster with all of the exercise I am doing. I think of that Malcolm in the Middle where the dad puts all this fattening stuff in the Mom’s food so she can’t lose weight and in fact, gains. (The dad likes her butt to be big, you see).  I don’t think Boo is sabotaging my efforts. I just have to get back to a more mindful place to eat. And for starters, even though I may not be able to count calories for dinner while I am away this weekend, I will write everything down and try to estimate portion sizes. Bringing my food journal on our trip is the step I will take to reframe my habits, and get back on track by next week.

      Sorry it’s been a couple of days since I last posted. Yes that is partially due to the Independence Day holiday, but it is also due to some sad circumstances as well.  Boo’s mom has been fighting non-Hodgkins lymphoma since I met him 2 ½ years ago. She has been undergoing treatment off and on for this condition since I have known her, but mostly she has been in decent shape and good spirits. Unfortunately, the treatment options have just about run out for her without any improvement in her condition. They are now switching from trying to cure her to trying to “keep her comfortable”. The last round of treatments really sucked away her energy and she was in the hospital this weekend with a morphine drip and to receive blood transfusions because her platelet count has gone so low. As of this week she will be “kept comfortable” at home.   I am so tempted to put aside dealing with food issues and just eat whatever I want. True to form, I did a little of that Sunday and Monday. I feel so bad for Boo, he is very close to his mom. I don’t feel there is much I can do to help him except be there with a hug. And I have decided to try and keep everything as normal as possible around the house. Which means, continuing to go to the gym every morning and watching my food intake. This whole situation is especially tough with the wedding coming up. I don’t think it will be the same without her there to share it with us. All we can do now is hope for a miracle.

      The fourth key is basically analyzing your bad eating habits and then finding ways to replace them with better habits. A bad habit could be eating too fast, giving in to food cravings, or eating while watching television.  Dr. Phil also talks about the payoffs you get from overeating. My big payoffs for overeating are pleasure ( I like to have a party in my mouth), Irrational reward, and immediate gratification.   He gives some suggestions for other activities you can do to prevent yourself from overeating: fun ones like emailing friends, relaxing ones like listening to music and general life ones like paying bills. He points out that each of the activities in his list have their own payoffs, such as being more connected with friends and family, stress reduction, and a sense of accomplishment. This actually makes a lot of sense but I think you have to consciously take the time to feel the payoff once you’ve done the activity.   He gives the usual tips on how to prevent some of the bad habits (put your fork down between bites, only eat in the kitchen or dining room, at parties place yourself away from the food table, etc.), and while I feel I know every one of them it is good to be reminded sometimes.  One thing he points out is to try to make a meal last 30 minutes. Right now my meals last about 10. I am going to try and draw out my eating so that it takes longer.   One note about last night: we went to the drive-in and Boo suggested we get snacks. We ate chips and cheese dip, a few cookies, 2 frappuccinos, and 2 candy bars. But the good news is we brought some goldfish crackers, some Crunch-N-Munch and 4 other candy bars and we didn’t eat any of it. The weird part was, we thought we were being conservative in the snack purchases when we bought them. I said to Boo, if we do this again, we know to bring two snacks (for variety) and diet soda. I felt queasy from eating the crap that I did finish.  The only problem is now there is all this crap food in my house!

      I am really glad it’s Friday and that I have Monday off. We have a relaxing weekend planned with no travel, few visitors, and lots of down time. I don’t really have much to say today; I haven’t finished the next key in the Dr. Phil book, my eating is on track, my exercise is on track, I lost weight this week, and it looks like an easy weekend food-wise. The only risk I run is lack of exercise on the 4th (gym is closed). But one day off once in a while isn’t so bad. We may walk to see the fireworks display, anyway.  I hope everyone enjoys the holiday!

      My calories have been around 1500-1700 this week, so that is an improvement over the last couple of weeks. Although it is a holiday weekend, we do not have anything scheduled other than at our own house, where I can control the food. Boo had bought a new barbecue and salads cookbook, and we found some healthy choices in there (cucumber and tomato salad, sweet and sour onion salad, spicy corn salad, grilled pesto shrimp, grilled chicken and pineapple-kabobs, and grilled stuffed squash). So it’s all good. I should be fine for the weekend.   The other good news is I am down a pound this week, to 209. Yay me. I don’t seem to be able to lose much more than a pound no matter how much I exercise or cut back, so I am happy with this. I wish the gym would purchase a highly accurate digital scale – my personal trainer showed me the other day that the scale is not “zeroed” correctly, it balances at like ¾ pound. But the readout is pretty similar to my scale at home, so I go with it.   My trainer wants me to start working out with weights on the off days that I come in the gym and do cardio. I will ask him for specifics, because right now I just kind of go along with whatever he makes me do, without paying attention to the weight or reps or anything.  Besides, it is not like we have a set routine, he really mixes it up which had seemed pretty random to me until he explained what he was trying to do. What he is trying to do is go between resistance and cardio exercises to keep my heart rate up and burn calories while gaining strength.   Wedding Update: We got the sketches back for the custom rings, and while mine looks fine, Boo doesn’t want any diamonds in his. I think his would look cool with 3 or 4, but he just wants a band.  In addition, I met with the restaurant manager where we will have the rehearsal dinner, and got that firmed up a bit. I still have to mail him a $100 deposit though. This weekend I will have to put the addresses into our guest list spreadsheet.

           Yesterday afternoon, Boo’s mom passed away. Boo was very strong through the whole thing, gently holding her hand and telling her what a good person she was, a terrific mom, respected nursing teacher, beloved wife, and that it was ok for her to go.  He’s tough.  The family is holding together well, because they believe that she is in a better place, and with her dad and other loved ones that went before her.   Boo has taken the week off to spend with his dad and brother. Calling hours will be Wednesday, and the funeral service will be Thursday. I am working today, tomorrow and Friday. There is not much for me to do to help them, they are going through her old papers and sorting through stuff.  I would just be in the way. But Wednesday and Thursday I will be with them, and needless to say, I don’t think I will be posting.  Thanks to all of you who sent positive vibes and/or prayers to Boo and his family.

      One of the things about Boo that is really great for me is that he’s domestic. I moved into a house that he already owned when we got engaged, and he has continued to take primary responsibility for keeping things on the home front running smoothly. I wait for him to say, “Ok LibrarianOnTheLoose, you clean the kitchen and bathroom and mop the floors while I mow the lawn and trim the hedges.” Ok, so he doesn’t call me LibrarianOnTheLoose, but you get the idea. The only thing I have control over  (and the only thing I want control over – I am not by nature particularly domestic) is what we are going to eat. But that’s been out the window since he’s been spending every night at his parents, and sleeping over there on the weekend. So for me it’s been take out Chinese, pizza, wings. I am just not in the mood to cook something if he is not going to be here to eat it with me. In addition, I am doing emotional eating, taking comfort in my favorite foods to make up for his absence and to calm myself from being upset over his mom’s demise.   It is really weird, in yoga they would call it the “witness state” where you are observing everything that’s going on in your brain, but doing nothing to interact or change the thinking. I KNOW I am on a chaos spiral and I know what I am supposed to be doing, but I am just sitting back watching it happen. So today I did a compromise thing. After I went to the gym (forcing myself to keep up the routines without boo other wise I’d really be up shit’s creek without a paddle) I took myself out to brunch at a luncheonette in an upscale suburb, and got a vegetable omelet with tomato basil toast. Since I didn’t eat breakfast (well I had some Andes chocolates),  this would count for two meals. But the good thing about this luncheonette is that they make terrific, rich, homeade soups, and they freeze the extra and sell it. Did I mention they are having a 2 for 1 sale? When Boo was home to shower and change yesterday, we went there for lunch and bought some soups and baked goods for his dad. Well, I decided to buy some for myself today. Manhattan clam chowder and seafood chowder and a $1 loaf of bread and scones. This stuff has to be better for me than the pizza and Chinese, and it’s just as quick and easy. Plus it is delicious and cheap. I am thinking of it as damage control. I may be going back and getting more by the end of the week if the plan works.  The other strategy I am going to employ if I get sick of soup is the huge salad strategy. I will make a huge salad with a wide variety of vegetables and maybe some turkey and ham or garbanzo beans to give it protein. Then, worried that the salad will spoil and be wasted, I will eat a big bowl of it every night until its gone. One cooking episode to make the salad, and then it’s just scoop and eat. I bought two organic dressings when I was in Buffalo, some kind of green garlic, and then roasted pepper vinaigrette.  In the mean time, I am trying to stay on top of the house, doing the dishes, making the bed. I discovered the garbage is full (of Chinese containers, no doubt), and instead of magically emptying like when Boo is here, I will have to empty it on my way out today. I am actually trying to use some of Dr. Phil’s advice: first, by implementing the soup and salad plan, I am programming my environment so that I will not continue to fail in the eating department. And by keeping on top of the house, I am working his other key about finding things to do in your life that give you a reward and keep you from overeating.  Boo’s Aunt Peg and Uncle Skip came up last night from New Jersey to visit his parents, and were shocked to find out how badly Boo’s mom has deteriorated.  She no longer speaks clearly, instead you hear what I can only describe as a“querulous drone” which is a phrase from Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton.  She has an old person’s wheeze and a wretched cough.  She does not seem to recognize anybody and mostly sleeps, unless she is in pain; then the drone. The hospice people said the last thing to go is the hearing, so Boo’s dad and Boo’s brother made CD mixes of her favorite songs and they are playing them for her.  They also plan on playing these CDs at her funeral, with a digital photo montage of pictures of her. Everybody has gone from praying for a speedy recovery to praying for a peaceful passing.

          The last key is about the people around you. There are people in your life who sabotage your weight loss efforts. They may do this by pushing food on you, giving you backhanded compliments “oh you’re getting too thin” or by trying to control you or being inflexible about the changes you are making in your life. Dr. Phil explains their motivations for acting the way they do (it’s not that they don’t have your best interests at heart, its that they have their own needs that they fear are not going to be met if you change). He then asks you to make a list of saboteurs, identify their means of sabotage, and plan how you are going to handle these events. Now, I am lucky because most of my sabotaging family is across the state from me and it is only a problem when I visit them.  I have one other saboteur who is the “green eyed monster” type (jealous) and gives me back handed compliments or questions my food choices. This is a co-worker and the easiest thing to do is avoid having lunch with her.  Then Dr. Phil talks about the people in your life who are supportive, and he identifies some types to have on your side: a coach, a team player, a cheerleader, an umpire. These people are working to help you achieve your goal, and may not fit neatly into these roles, but they generally provide support and honest feedback about your progress. The main people I have in this category are Boo (if it wasn’t for him I’d never get out of bed to go to the gym in the morning, he eats whatever low calorie meal I put in front of him, and tells me EVERY SINGLE DAY when I come back from the gym that he’s proud of me -- EVERY SINGLE DAY!) Then there’s my trainer the ex-marine, who is kind of in the umpire category (honest feedback) but also a cheerleader too. And then I have a couple of friends who have adjusted to my need to meet for healthy dinners and exercise, although with all that’s going on with Boo’s mom, I haven’t seen much of them lately.  Dr. Phil talks about having a support network or group. And I have done weight watchers and overeaters anonymous which are two models of support groups. I got more out of overeaters anonymous, but never found a sponsor, so I left that program after 2 years of trying. I was realizing that my new support network is the bloggers and other members of the online community who participate in weight loss discussions. The  urlLink Weigh-Better Forum  is one terrific place to get support if you are a woman.  I like this method much better than the meetings I used to go to, because if someone posts something I think is wacky or misguided, I skip it and move on to the good stuff.  Needless to say, if saboteurs are getting in the way of your weight loss efforts you have to change your relationship with them, and maybe work on cultivating new friendships and new relationships. Dr. Phil does not say leave your family, instead he gives things to say to them to try and enlist their support and acceptance of the lifestyle changes you are making.  The next chapter is about when you try and still don’t lose weight and other troubleshooting techniques. I don’t know when I will get to it, I am hoping Sunday.

      I am having a really hard time. My schedule is really pressed for time now that we are spending most of our evenings up at Boo’s parents’ house. Yesterday I was feeling dizzy and clammy, so I didn’t go in to the University for the afternoon job. I was supposed to work till 8pm. Instead I came home and slept on the couch and had guilt dreams about missing work. And then I got up in the early evening, and ordered Chinese. Now, I didn’t eat it like I used to, there is still more than half of it left over. But when I did the calories for the day I was around 2300, same as I have been since Friday when I left for Buffalo. (note to Meta – no I never have been to Charlie the Butcher’s … it is only a couple of miles from my parents house though. The plan was to go to Schwabl’s, which is out in West Seneca and a throwback to the 1940’s with waitresses in white and real mashed potatoes)…  I am not going to lose any weight at 2300 calories, but like Dr. Phil says, I am trying to reinforce the positive. And the positive is that I am #1 still diligently writing my food down and counting or estimating calories and #2 exercising regularly.  I wanted to talk about the exercising thing for a minute.  urlLink Juju  the other day had a post about "dont binge, burn" when you’re stressed or depressed (or as I like to think of it, "sweat it out). And today I was feeling depressed and wiped out and lumpy. I went to Dunkin’ Donuts for breakfast (600 calories), and had a vending machine taco (320 calories) for lunch, then came home and had leftover whole wheat pasta with artichoke and lemon pesto. And I had bagged working out this morning because I knew I could go in the afternoon (even though last night I promised myself I would work out in the morning and then go back and swim in the afternoon). I was talking myself out of exercising for the day and thinking of digging into the leftover Chinese when I thought about Juju’s post. Basically it said instead of medicating yourself with food, do it with exercise. So I made a plan to go to the gym for half an hour.  Well, dontcha know they have the fitness center all rearranged at the gym. Everythings all mixed up, weights, cybex, cardio and lots of the cardio equipment is no longer in sight of a television. The arc trainers were being used and my favorite treadmills as well (the other treadmills shake too much when I go fast). So, I rowed for 30 min. I must say, I kicked ass, covering 5300 Meters in half an hour. The last time I did a full half an hour of rowing, maybe a month to two months ago, I did like 3500 M. And let me tell you now, sitting here all sweaty, I am more mentally refreshed than I have been all day. Which is probably why this is turning out to be such a long post.  Plus, I feel better than when I was overeating, because I know I did something good for myself. And I am not interested in overeating for dinner.  So the moral of the story, kids, is to sweat it out. It really works.

      So today, I was off running some errands. I decided to go out to lunch, but I didn’t have much cash on me. I saw that the restaurant had a visa sign in the door so I went in. I had placed my order and was looking around the restaurant and noticed a sign: Visa and Master Card $15.00 minimum. Now what I had ordered only came to about $9.00 and I only had $8.00 with me. How did I solve this dilemma, you ask? Well I did the sensible thing and ordered dessert and coffee, bringing the total to $15.05.  Is that a stupid reason to overeat or what? Does anybody have any suggestions how I could have handled this without ordering the key lime pie – bearing in mind that I was at the restaurant by myself?
