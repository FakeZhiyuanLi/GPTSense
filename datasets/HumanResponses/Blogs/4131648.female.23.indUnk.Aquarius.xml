             Since i wasn’t able to open/administer my original blogger, I decided to put everything in here and post some recaps of what happened for the past months.       It’s been a while when I started to live on my own. At first, I was so happy, finally im free! I can do whatever I wanna do! But I was wrong, living alone and miles away with your family is not as easy as I thought. If before there’s someone who will do things for me, now I have to do things on my own, like do the things you never used to. For the past months, I remember, I really have to have two alarms (clock and cellphone), for me to wake up on time or earlier than the usual just to prepare my stuffs and get myself ready to work. Another worst thing was  if the manang, didn’t get to pick up your laundry at weekends and all laundry shops available near your place cant accept yours because they have a lot of labada already, oh my gees,I cant do anything about it but to do my own laundry and iron it, I even experienced not to eat breakfast before I go to work for months because I don’t know how to cook,  then I  really wanted to gave up and go back to where I came from but then I realized that I have to proved something to my family especially to my parents. Ha! well that’s what life is all about I guess!...it was fun to reminisce those memories of the past isn’t it? And yeah, I’ve learned from those experiences…       Now im still living of my own but not as dull as before thanks to ludy and mai..my roommates hehehehe my two fellas…si God talaga pag nagbiro of all people here on earth He gave me these two …for the last  9 months of being together I’ve learn nothing from them hahahahahah joke joke! Nah they are those people I never stop thanking heaven for…We get along with each other, though we have a different kind of interest. Si Ludy  addict yan sa pocket books but she’s so genius may sariling mundo minsan, Si Mai  well sa boyfriend lang sa addict J hehehe when were together we are like a bunch of psychotic talking machine, never ending  daldalan to the max! Especially when we are having dinner we spent so little time in eating yet we spent so much time talking after,  so that makes us  stay in the dinning table in 1 hr or so…and what’s good news is that we started to cook! Yes! Yes!We can cook now! I never for once entertained the thought that someday (which is happening now) I can cook those things! Though not as good as perfect as those pros..For us naman as long as it pleases us sabay sabay” OK NA YAN!” hahahah …hmmmnn what are those menus that we’ve already tried to cooked….ah adobo, sinigang, chicken curry, or prito( di pa perfect) heheh ..ah oist LUDY AND MAI ano na nga yung mga iba? ay x xa  im gonna tell na lng sa susunod…
