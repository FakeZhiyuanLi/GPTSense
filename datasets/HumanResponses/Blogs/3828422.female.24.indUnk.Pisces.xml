      I haven't cried in a long time. I miss the release. I used to cry at anything, but now I feel numb to any pain that I experience. Maybe this is a gift. Or maybe I'm just dying inside and I don't know it. When I think of Emily I feel empty. Maybe if I went to her grave--but I'm too scared. Scared to open up my heart again to feel the ache. It's unhealthy. It's denial. But it's safe. And so I just keep getting up in the morning...and dozing off at night.   Sometimes I wish it was me. How simple and easy a life to lead that only ventures into your 23rd year. I'm past it...and so far there has been discovery and growth...but always a void in my relationships because I am missing a part. I have no model to watch. I was robbed of my older sister. Robbed. It isn't real. Now who do I look to except myself? My track record doesn't show something to follow. Lost in a world carrying Gap bags...trying to find some kind of feeling. I'll just keep doing what I'm doing. Love my family. Love my friends. And keep on laughing.  I know I'll see her soon.

      I just remembered that time at the market  Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart  And rode down  Isle 5   You looked behind you to smile back at me  Crashed into a rack full of magazines  They asked us  If we could leave   Can't remember what went wrong last september  Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to   Our love was  Comfortable and  So broken in   I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to  My friends all approve say she's gonna be good for you  They throw me  High fives   She says the bible is all that she reads  And prefers that I not use profanity  Your mouth was  So dirty   Life of the party  And she swears that she's artsy  But you could distinguish  Miles from Coltrane   Our love was  Comfortable and  So broken in   She's perfect  So flawless  Or so they say ay ay ay  Say ay ay ay   She thinks I can't see the smile that she's fakin'  And poses for pictures that are being taken  I loved you  Grey sweat pants  No makeup  So perfect   Our love was  Comfortable and  So broken in   She's perfect  So flawless  I'm not impressed  I want you back

      And here I am, pressing forward into the unknown. My head swells with contempt, but the new taste of excitement slips over my tongue with ease. Somehow. Someday. Somewhere. And I'll meet you there. You'll be holding my coat. You'll be raw with fatigue. I'll give you my hand and we'll walk alongside each other, feet scuffing and throats burning.  Can I see your scar again? Can I see it in the light.  Run my hands...over your face...like a sheet of silk... I'll ride your bike. You take my hand. Off into the nothing...but back before dawn.

      I want to sing the feelings that shiver through my spine when I think of you.  The melody would scream out and grab your hair.  And then I'd grab the back of your neck.  Bring you close to my writhing body.  Breathe into your ear.  Squeeze your bicep.  And I'd kiss you.

      I saw you at the mall today. Your hair was shaggier than it usually is and your shirt was half untucked. You seemed unusally distracted. I saw you at the mall today. You forced laughter and chewed your gum like it was your last piece. You seemed unusually sad. I saw you at the mall today. You sat among plastic people and sipped on your fucking latte. You seemed unusally shallow. I saw you at the mall today. You looked past me and I looked past you.  You seemed uncomfortable with our unspoken agreement to pretend I was invisible. I saw you at the mall today.  How do things become this ridiculous. Seriously.

      It's the days when I smile. When I know that I have strong beautiful friends who love me. When I know that my family is amazing and my relationship with each and every one in it is special. It's when I can thank my mom for letting me be me. It's when I call Marty at work and can cry and she knows me. Days like this I know what's important...and what should be dismissed. I need to remember days like this.

      Resist. Deny. Shudder. Sigh. Breathe. Press. Shiver. Comply. Restrict. Hot. Sweat. Yearn. Want. Flash. Faint. Resist. Comply. Resist. Comply. Surrender. And I can't believe I got a fucking parking ticket.

      What does it feel like to have a mother who loves you unconditionally? What does it feel like to ask for help and not wince at her response? What does it feel like to have her priority be her family? What does it feel like to know she respects you? What is it like to not have everything thrown back into your face? What is it like to know a mother who is the same with everyone in her life? What is it like to not be afraid of what she'll say? What compells her to hug you and just tell you she loves you for you? What am I doing wrong? I don't want to move back to Dill Street. Thank God it's only for a month and a half.

      And so now we are leaving apathetic messages on one another's machines...and this is what we have become. How can a friendship switch so quickly from kindred spirits to disconnected lines? We shared 10 long years of laughter, frustrations and many vicious struggles. And now it's done. But I cannot carry the weight anymore. I cannot be the pillar to which she clung to...I have my own battles to fight. And I want to slap her in the face. And I want her to fail miserably. And I want her to be alone. And I want her to someday realise that she is slightly insane. And I feel these things. And this is why it is good that we are no longer friends.

      And so it ends...drink after drink until my gut wants to squeeze out the percentage of liquid courage I pushed inside. And yet I must keep going...How will these people turn out? One day their livers will spit them out into an alley where stray cats will nibble on their dry lips until their bodies heave their last breath. And then they will finally be at peace. It was time for me to go. Sucked into the dungeon...infusing me with an isolation which could only be soothed when surrounded by the lost souls who are only more lost than yourself. And so I leave...just before my optimism is long gone...just before i forget what it's like to wake before noon...just before i myself fear the daylight and crave the stale taste of hops. Good-Bye Einstein's. I will remember you as I look back at the year which changed my life forever.
