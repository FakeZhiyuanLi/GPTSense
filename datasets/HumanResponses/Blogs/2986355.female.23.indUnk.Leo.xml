       Obviously I'm very very bored today, as this is like my sixteenth post.  But I just love it when people use sayings they've heard a lot without thinking about what they mean and get them wrong.  Like this fine gentleman:  L, I changed my Cell #....... - m4w   I know it's been over two years, but I'm sure you realize you would like to talk again. However, I changed my cell so e-mail me and we can rap once again !  I think I finally soaked my last wild oat !

       I may be going to hell, but I'm sorry, this just makes me laugh.  Oh how I adore  urlLink Craigslist .  Can I get a Hallelujah?  the young, the hip, the devout - 27   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reply to: anon-27773333@craigslist.org Date: 2004-03-31, 3:20PM EST  Anyone who thinks that christianity isn't hip should visit their local tattoo parlor...notice any icons?, and these are the old school tats, Religion has always been hip, people. We can love the lord, shoot some stick, drink some whiskey, go to art shows, blah, blah, blah. Besides try having a conversation with some one who knows religion, it's doubtful you'll ever be more engaged. (years of debating things beyond our knowledge will do that to a person)  Can I get a Hallejuah!   it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests this is in or around this city

       Via  urlLink Productshop :  "Jackie Farry has worked with and been friends with every great band from Nirvana to The Yeah Yeah Yeahs. While she was The Datsuns tour manager, she was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a rare form of cancer, and has been to sick to work and is facing nasty financial problems. But as she says, "Fuck Cancer!" So here's the deal. There are two ways to help Jackie out. The first is to go to her  urlLink Fuck Cancer Benifit Concert  on May 11th at the Bowery Ballroom that will feature Cat Power, Har Har Superstar, Miss Pussycat, and a bunch of other bands. The second, and what I recommend you should do, is enter the  urlLink Fuck Cancer Raffle . This is one of the coolest fucking raffles I've ever seen. For just $12 you can have a chance at winning Nick Zinner of The Yeah Yeah Yeah's guitar / Le Tigre Tote bag / Iggy Pop signed poster / tickets to Coachella / Guitar Lessons from Stephan Malkmus / Drum lessons from Russel Simins (JSBX) / Free Day of Recording for your band with Nicolas Vernhes (Fiery Furnaces, Fischerspooner, etc) / and tons of other amazing prises. Enter the contest, get karma, win cool shit, and fuck cancer............"

       As someone who's worked with just about every kind of dog and every kind of owner, I had already unscientifically determined that  urlLink people tend to get dogs that resemble themselves in both looks and personality .  One of my best friends in high school was from a family of very very thin people, and, of course, they had a  urlLink whippet .  And then there are the portly folks with the bulldogs and the yappy little Upper East Side girls with their yappy little  urlLink dogs-in-a-bag .  I love most dogs, but I really want one of  urlLink these .  Sadly, I fear getting one would require an apartment that is greater than 144 square feet and at least one of the following: free time, excess income, husband.  Yeah, not gonna happen any time soon.

       Ooooh my god, remember the game of  urlLink MASH , that you played in the back of 7th grade math class until you got yelled at so you flipped off the teacher and got taken to the principal's office but you lagged behind and ran away to the playground instead and then you almost got expelled but because Christians are forgiving you just had to miss the class trip to the waterpark and spend the day with the militant lesbian gym teacher?  I sure don't, but I hear it was a popular game.  [via  urlLink ultragrrrl  via  urlLink megadork ]

       I think it's a safe bet that if you're reading this you're on Friendster, and that you've had  urlLink this conversation  more than once [via  urlLink Morning News ].  On the one hand, I think it would be kind of refreshing to stop relying on the internet to facilitate socialization and communication.  On the other hand, I'd probably be too lazy/chicken to actually call people and would have no friends.

       According to  urlLink this article , casting is underway in Britain for 300 people to be naked extras in the new Johnny Depp "period piece packed with sexual material."  Wonder if Johnny will be naked as well.  Either way, I think it's time to move to the Isle of Man, girls.

       I always thought it was the blonde-haired, brown-eyed, round-faced, deep-voiced thing that was responsible for the 593 Julia Stiles comparisons I've gotten since she descended upon  urlLink teen celebrity land  a couple years ago.  But I think our shared ability to look sad/pissed off/aloof when not any of those things (okay, maybe aloof...) is what makes us true doppelgangers.  Hooray for no facial expression induced wrinkles!  From  urlLink midwestgrrl :  Would Someone Give Julia Stiles A Job A job that isn't acting, which she can't do anyway. Last time I checked, facial expressions were required in most acting jobs, even shitty ones, and her deadface isn't cutting it. I suppose now that movies like The Prince and Me are beginning to make it through her selection process, the inevitable downward spiral has begun in earnest. Look at it this way, Julia: You'll never need Botox!

       From  urlLink Page Six :  March 26, 2004 -- ANOTHER night, another carnal conquest for Mick Jagger (above). The 60-year-old Rolling Stone took a 20-year-old Columbia University co-ed named Meredith back to his suite at the Mandarin Oriental after partying with her at Lotus and Bungalow 8 the other night. Jagger met the brunette beauty at Lotus, but left with some pals and ended up at the more exclusive Bungalow 8, where he text-messaged her to join him. When Meredith and another giddy Columbia co-ed arrived, they couldn't get past its notoriously tough velvet ropes, so Jagger sent a friend to usher them inside. And the rest is history.   Haven't decided yet if I'm grossed out or jealous.  And do people really still go to Lotus and Bungalow 8?

       Best  urlLink website  I've found today, courtesy of the always excellent  urlLink Newyorkish :  "A site that allows you to send e-mail to yourself--to be delivered up to 25 years in the future.  What better way to remind yourself in a few years that you've failed to give up drinking, smoking, fatty foods, and promiscuous sex?"  Couldn't have said it better myself.

       After sorting through my new boss's commission reports, I'm a little unsettled by the fact that the amount of money he makes in a month while sitting on his 300+ pound ass reading online fly fishing catalogs (nothing against him, he's a nice guy) is more than my dad, who works his skinny effin' ass off, makes in an entire year.

       Blogger Quote of the Day (or Week, as it seems):    urlLink Drone  (on Robo):  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a man who generally has the perception of Helen Keller at infancy.  I just returned from the bathroom and discovered that this time the button on my pants was undone while the fly was zipped.  Clearly, I never should have graduated from the elastic waistband.    Also, I sent in a little  urlLink story  to Zulkey and she actually put it on her website!

       Yoanna House?  No, I already have an apartment, thanks.  Har har har.  Really though, I can't make too much fun of a show that has brought me such intense, dare I say orgasmic, joy over the past several months.  Perfectly situated on Tuesday evenings,  urlLink America's Next Top Model  gave me a will to live on the otherwise depressing Mondays and Tuesdays at work, and after Tuesday it's Wednesday and the weekend is in sight.  My life will now have a deep and painful void.  I fear this void can only be filled by the new season of  urlLink Six Feet Under , which, sadly, doesn't start until June.  Sigh.  Aside from the brilliance of ANTM itself, I will also miss the written summaries of each episode on UPN.com.  Just check out this drama!   Yoanna proceeds to find clippers and runs off to the bathroom to trim her hair herself. She ends up taking a huge chunk out of the back of her hairline and quickly learns why she should have other people cut her hair. Jay thinks that it might be just the competition, but is afraid "she might be breaking down inside."    Mercedes, still watching from the wings, is feeling that everyone loves Yoanna, but wants to tell her, "Bitch, you ain't going nowhere!"    Really, folks, it doesn't get any better than this.  'Till next season, America's Next Top Model.  I'll miss you.

       -Two of my three bosses are currently and independently perusing online fly-fishing catalogs.  -I cannot seem to remember to zip my pants when I leave the bathroom.  I think it's because I always do the button first.  This would not be such a huge deal if I didn't have to walk past approximately 150 men every time I get up from my desk.  Will have to get "zip pants" tattooed to the back of my hand or something.

         In my not so humble opinion, you, of course, belong in the Picture of Dorian Gray, and do not try to deny it. You belong in the fashionable circles of Victorian London where exotic tastes, a double life, decadence, wit and a hypocritical belief in moral betterment make you a home. You belong where the witty apothegms of Lords, the silly moralities of matrons, the blinding high of opium, and the beauty of visual arts mingle to form one convoluted world.     urlLink   Which Classic Novel do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        urlLink This game  isn't quite as exciting as that helicopter game I used to play against my boss for hours at a time, but it's probably even more frustrating.  The folks at Blacktable claim to have gotten a score of 35.042 seconds, but I think they're lying.  Until I beat them, of course.

       I woke up this fine, arctic-y morning cold, tired, and insanely jealous of my dear friends in Mexico, Panama, and ghetto Central Florida.  I was all set to spend the day looking sullen and feeling sorry for myself.  Then I read this week's installment of Savage Love.  Nothing like  urlLink a good granny jerking off a parakeet story  to give a person a new lease on life.

       Today I was diagnosed with rosacea.  No one has ever told me this before, and the doctor who did spent all of three minutes with me.  I got home and perused the  Times , and, lo and behold, there's an  urlLink article  about the overdiagnosis of rosacea in fair-skinned women of Celtic ancestry.  God, I feel like such a trend-whore!  I should just move to the  urlLink Lower Lower East Side  now and make my over-ness official.

       So last night, while Perplexa was listening to the Magnetic Fields and reading about the cultural history of late 19th century Paris, yours truly was watching the new MTV show   urlLink I Want a Famous Face  .  Yeeeeeeikes.  It was basically a half hour of schadenfreude, sans the freude.    The first episode featured a pair of acne-scarred twins aspiring to be the next Brad Pitts and followed them to an acting audition that made the Olsen twins look Oscar-worthy, the most awkward date in the history of mankind, and the nauseating facial reconstruction surgeries and painful recoveries.  In the end, they look nothing like Brad Pitt, as emphasized by an almost mocking side-by-side comparison, and misinterpret the attention and stares of others: "Every time my twin brother and I walk down the mall or at our shopping center, girls seem to do the double look and begin to chat with their friends."  Hmmm, wonder if the fact that they're tall male twins with Joan Rivers faces (and hair, for that matter) has anything to do with that...  These kids would probably have more acting success marketing themselves as fugly, a la the  urlLink Sherminator .  Now they're not just unhot, they're unhot and scary.  This, perhaps, is MTV's whole point?

       I slept like crap last night, as is typical for Sunday.  Probably has something to do with trying to go from a normal work week schedule to staying up all night and sleeping all day on weekends...   I used to freak out when I couldn't sleep but have come to almost appreciate it.  The resultant zombie-like state makes 9.5 hours of staring at a computer screen go by so much more quickly, and dreams are always more vivid when I'm only half-asleep.  Last night, for example, I awoke genuinely believing for a minute or two that I had been in a cycling class with Joan and Melissa Rivers.  I think it's from watching too much E! and planning to go to the gym today, but let's see what a surely credible and scientific online  urlLink dream dictionary  has to say about this:    Plastic   To see plastic objects in your dream, suggests that you are being fake and artificial. You are not being genuine and true to yourself.   Let's just ignore the glaring grammatical error in that first sentence.  'Tis true, Online Dream Dictionary.  You've figured me out.  But I'm only corporate whoring so that I can live in my beloved city whilst figuring out what to do with my life.  Forgive me.    Bicycle   To dream that you are riding a bicycle, signifies your desires to attain a balance in your life. You need to balance work and pleasure in order to succeed in your current undertakings. If you have difficulties riding the bicycle, then it suggests that you are experiencing anxieties about making it on your own. To see a  bicycle in your dream, indicates that you need to devote time to leisurely pursuits and recreation.   Okay, somebody at the ODD has some issues with infinitives and comma usage.  Nevertheless, I will try to devote more time to leisurely pursuits since drinking six out of seven days last week (jeebus, did I really do that?) apparently was not enough.

       For one reason or another, I've always had a minor obsession with names.  Part of it probably comes from my fascination with psychology in general and, therefore, the implications one's name can have on personality development.  (But is it the name itself that affects a person, or the kind of parents who selected it?  Hmm...)  Mostly, however, I think it's just because names can be so darn humorous.  As a kid, I would check the public records in the paper every day and make fun of the poor, innocent babies with cracked out parents.  Perhaps I was just bitter that my own name lends itself to teasing through the use of a simple mispronunciation, which, by the way, always resurfaces when I acquire a new group of friends.   urlLink The   urlLink college   urlLink ones  were perhaps even more delighted and self-congratulatory than the second-graders who made the initial discovery.  Anyway, when perusing my hometown paper the other day, I came upon a shocking realization.  There has, apparently, been a recent mass migration of Irish and Welsh refugees to the predominantly Polish and German Central Wisconsin!   In the past three days, 15 bundles of joy arrived at the local hospital.  Ten of them have quasi-Gaelic sounding names ending in -en, -an, or -on.  Some of my personal favorites:  MaCayden  (I think they mean "Mc," not that it would be any better)  Zembruski Ashton  (do we really need another?)  Rindfleisch THREE Aiden's  (curse you, Sex and the City),  one of which is part of a set of triplets called... Aiden, Logan, and Mason  (say that five times fast)  The requisite couple of Madisons, and, the winner, which needs no commentary Hilton Jaden, a girl  There is an  urlLink excellent website  devoted to the topic of baby names gone awry.  It's so long and excellent, in fact, that I blame it for the .6 point drop in my GPA junior year.  An excerpt:  "We aren't having kids for another year or two, but we like Kellyna Nychole, Taryn Mykah and Mykenzie Kathryn for girls.   This woman was indicted under the Flagrant Over-Use of the Letters K and Y Act of 1983 ."   Speaking of babies and such things, here is my official QUOTE OF THE DAY, courtesy of two girls i know way too much about considering I've never met them.  urlLink Lindsayism :  Describe a personal theory you have about guys and girls or relationships.  urlLink Ultragrrrl :  Men are pussies.  Women are retarded.  We're better off alone until it's time to get married and have babies.  Amen, sister.

       Oh my...Courtney Love, who I inadvertently was last Halloween (oh to have had a digital camera back then,) is playing at Bowery Ballroom next Thursday.  Her  urlLink new album  is supposed to be "depressingly repulsive," but I'm sure the inevitable trainwreck would be amusing.  I wonder if she will top Cat Power's escapade at the Knitting Factory in which Chan Marshall ended up in the middle of the audience, in the fetal position, on my feet, still singing, before running out the back door.  I would totally go see Courtney just for kicks if it weren't $25.  It would probably be more worth the money to just be like her by getting wasted on  urlLink vodka and gatorade  and taking some of my leftover vicodin.

       Hello, everyone.  After spending countless hours over the past year working (i.e., reading blogs and related stimulating web pages,) the time has come to spread the Good Word to those not fortunate enough to have such copious one-on-one computer time.  And so, I bring you my first post.  I have no idea where it came from (before my sister got her hands on it) so I'll just post it in its glorious entirety.  The two of us grew up in a rather conservative Christian town and still torture ourselves by reading the logic-challenged pro-Jesus rants in the local  urlLink paper , so this hit a particular nerve:  On her radio show, Dr Laura Schlesinger recently stated that, as an observant Orthodox Jew, homosexuality is for her, an abomination and cannot be condoned under any circumstance. She called upon the Holy Scriptures, specifically, Leviticus 18:22 to support her position.    ************    For the Love of Leviticus    Dear Dr. Laura:  Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God's Law. I have learned a great deal from your show, and try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind them that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate. I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some other elements of God's Law and how to follow them.  1. When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord - Lev.1:9. The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. Should I smite them?  2. I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as sanctioned in  Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?  3. I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual uncleanliness - Lev.15: 19-24. The problem is how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.  4. Lev. 25:44 states that I may indeed possess slaves, both male and female, provided they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans, but not Canadians. Can you clarify? Why can't I own Canadians?  5. I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2. The passage clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?  6. A friend of mine feels that even though  urlLink eating shellfish is an abomination  - Lev. 11:10, it is a lesser abomination than homosexuality.  I don't agree. Can you settle this? Are there 'degrees' of abomination?  7. Lev. 21:20 states that I may not approach the altar of God if I have a defect in my sight. I have to admit that I wear reading glasses. Does my vision have to be 20/20, or is there some wiggle room here?  8. Most of my male friends get their hair trimmed, including the hair around their temples, even though this is expressly forbidden by Lev.19:27. How should they die?   9. I know from Lev. 11:6-8 that touching the skin of a dead pig makes me unclean, but may I still play football if I wear gloves?  10. My uncle has a farm. He violates Lev. 19:19 by planting two different crops in the same field, as does his wife by wearing garments made of two different kinds of thread (cotton/polyester blend). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. Is it really necessary that we go to all the trouble of getting the whole town together to stone them? - Lev.24:10-16. Couldn't we just burn them to death at a private family affair like we do with people who sleep with their in-laws? (Lev. 20:14)   I know you have studied these things extensively and thus enjoy considerable expertise in such matters, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God's word is eternal and unchanging.  Your adoring fan,    James M. Kauffman, Ed.D.  Professor Emeritus  Dept. of Curriculum, Instruction, and Special Education, University of Virginia

          I was all set to write an ode to the cheese curd in honor of my upcoming trip to Montreal, where, I was a little too excited to learn, cheese curds are a key component of the  urlLink signature food .  But then yesterday some lowlife piece of donkey shit had to go and burglarize my apartment, and now it's all I can think about.  Some money was stolen from me when I was at a waterpark in eighth grade, but since then it's been pretty much smooth sailing.  I've never even lost my wallet.  Last night, however, I returned home from work to find an empty space where my mp3-filled computer used to be, my brand new digital camera missing, and a wide open window.  Post-shower this morning I threw some clothes at my laundry bag, but they hit the floor because that's gone too.  I do hope the motherfucker enjoys my dirty underwear.  I was going to buy a new computer soon anyway, my parents generously offered to replace the camera, and shopping for cute undies is fun.  But now I know that someone has been in my apartment, and based on a rudimentary understanding of criminals, it's pretty much a guarantee that he or she (who am I kidding--he) will be back.  My neighbor, who once shared my false sense of security, has been robbed twice and now keeps his door to the roof locked.  Thanks for warning me, dude.  So now all I can do I guess is keep the roof door locked, lock my windows, close the shades, and pray to god I'm not home sick the day a face appears in the window causing me to have a heart attack and die.  Oh, and apparently there's this nifty thing called  urlLink renter's insurance .  My mom's been telling me to get it since I moved in, and she erroneously assumed I was responsible enough to follow through.  Silly, silly parents.  All in all, I guess there are some things you just have to learn the hard way.  Like how it took me about ten blistering burns to accept the fact that whities like me do need to wear sunscreen.  Hopefully I'll only have to learn this the hard way once.

       It is with great sadness that I inform you of the impending departure of the  urlLink Fat Asian Baby .  On Monday she will leave the place she has called home for the last 24 years for an indeterminate but definitely too long time.  As the FAB is pretty much homeless, I hosted a farewell gathering for her on my roof terrace thingy that featured the only items befitting of this occasion:  meat and beer.   Last night I met up with the FAB after work, and we went to Gristedes to buy supplies.  I'm normally a Fairway kinda girl, but Gristedes is half a block closer to my place, there's never anyone there, and there are these creepy cartoon chicken and cow statues that talk to you when you take the escalator downstairs and that I am becoming strangely obsessed with.  Anyway, we rounded up several cases of beer, a couple of meat products, and various grilling necessities.  Upon checkout, we realized that it would be rather difficult for the two of us to carry 60 beers and four bags of groceries, even just two blocks.  As we were trying in vain to distribute the bags, a kind stranger came to the rescue.  "Here, take my shopping cart," he said.  I hesitate to use the pronoun "he," because said stranger had quite sizable breasts and was dressed in a silky feminine shirt and tight white pants.  He reminded me of an older, more weathered  urlLink RuPaul .  Apparently, he was turning in aluminum cans for the deposit money, and had found a shopping cart on the street somewhere that he no longer needed.  After a pause to process the fact that a homeless drag queen had just offered us a free shopping cart, the FAB and I accepted the gift graciously.  So thanks again, Homeless Gristedes Drag Queen.  I will think fondly of you whenever anyone says New Yorkers are unfriendly and selfish, and, of course, whenever I use my new shopping cart to procure mass quantities of cheap beer.    (I have spent all morning figuring out how to do this fancy picture posting technique)

       Something very fishy is going on over here in my humongous midtown box o' fun.  I've been solidly occupied with work (not my usual "work," but, like, real actual work) for nearly four hours and I'm still busy!  This is largely due to the absences of both Fatboss and Stereotypicalboss.  The former is in Brooklyn scouring the home of his deceased, senile, packrat aunt and uncle for an emerald ring that may or may not be hidden there somewhere.  I keep picturing him as an over-sized Gollum calling out for his precious while pawing through stacks of Reader's Digest from the 1980s.  The latter is with his wife at the doctor trying to make mini STbosses and/or Lawn Guysland JAP's.  I don't think I've ever answered the telephone more times in one day in my entire life.  I also had no idea where this post was going, but the inaccuracy of that last sentence brought on the realization that my current job, taking orders for bonds and things, is not at all unlike my first.    And so I bring you the website of my  urlLink first place of employment , where I spent the weekends of the 1998 holiday season taking telephone orders for ceramic barns filled with cheese, Precious Moments figurines, and  urlLink other   urlLink extremely   urlLink tasteful   urlLink items .  There is certainly a perfect gift for each of your loved ones, as several of the  urlLink Fat Asian Baby's  dearest learned the hard way this past Christmas.

       I could get used to going to a rock show every Monday night.  Such a better way to start the week than watching  urlLink the most annoying people in the world  argue about nothing on  The Inferno .  Only problem is now I'm too tired to write in complete sentences.  Which is not really a problem since I'm not required to do such a thing at my job.  Here are my fractured thoughts on the evening:  *there were more boys than girls at the show (which, I should probably add now that I'm awake, was Sleater-Kinney)  *the brunette guitarist rocks, and if I were a boy I'd have a crush on her  *the rockin' brunette guitarist was wearing  urlLink Citizens of Humanity  jeans, because even political activist indie-rockstars want their asses to look good  *the crowd's energy picked up towards the end, but Perplexa wins the award for most consistent enthusiastic dancing (although that sweaty older guy in the muscle-T takes a close second)  *when you cover the flash on your digital camera and you're someplace dark, not only does everything come out red, but people's eyes look rather freaky  *I should maybe consider, like, reading the instruction manual for my camera, because  urlLink these pictures  probably could have come out better  *the  urlLink Around the Clock Diner  should really change its name, because you cannot call yourself a diner in NYC and not serve milkshakes

       I changed my mind--I love Fatboss.  Annoying or not, he provides comic relief.  True, Crazyboss served the same function, but he was scary.  Anyway, the latest funny Fatboss story:  This super jappy girl who represents one of the computer programs we use comes over to hawk the program, basically.  So she sits down and flirts shamelessly with Fatboss and Stereotypicalboss.  She is about my age, so there's no way she's really genuinely enjoying their company, as her constant giggles would indicate.  After she leaves, Fatboss says, "I'm so in love with her."  I say to him, albeit shyly, "Because she was kissing your ass.  Do you really think she actually cares about you?"  Fatboss says no and turns to his computer to play the  urlLink Itchy and Scratchy  theme song 15 times in a row.

       Today I would like to introduce you to the writings of my darling little sis.  While she specializes in short works of fiction and history research papers, I most enjoy her analyses of articles from the Local Paper.  She is probably the only other person in the world who shares--nay, surpasses--my degree of love for this fine news source.  Last night I received three delightful emails from her:  *Just wanted to make sure you're aware that on the front page of today's  News Herald  there's a picture of a child named Cinnamon Harwood.  [Ed:  For some reason, Cinnamon, and it's improper spelling bastardizations, is quite popular in Wisconsin's Best Small City.  Though sadly not nearly as common as MacKhaeylah, Madicyn, and the like...]  *This is absolutely unbelievable.  I'm still shaking.  I think it's finally happened! The single worst ( = best)  News Herald  column in history!!! It has everything: complete inanity, horrendous syntax, lots of details that no one in their right mind would ever, ever, EVER care to hear, and a stupid, irrelevant, self-praising moral.   Please tell me you saw this:   urlLink 'No horsing around tolerated at the Boy Scout camp'   *Aaaahhhh!!!!  It's just too much!!  Sorry I'm sure you saw most if not all of these already, but I just can't resist.  The News Herald  is *brilliant* today...  "Criminal damage to property: A 39-year-old Marshfield woman reported her 42-year-old ex-boyfriend cut holes in her hooded sweatshirt, two bras, four pairs of underwear and a half T-shirt without her consent between March 6 and March 24 in the 300 block of East Fourth Street. Total damage was estimated at $100."  What a bastard. I mean I don't mind people cutting holes in my underwear if they *ask* first, but to do it without her consent is just crossing the line...  [Ed:  Also, I must point out that it was not just a T-shirt, but a HALF T-shirt.  I imagine this is some kind of hideous neon colored cutoff type thing, no doubt worn with acid-washed, tight-rolled jeans.]  And:  "A son, Ryan John Geiger, was born April 13, 2004, at Saint Joseph's Hospital to Katie Bader and Trampus J. Geiger of Colby. He joins sibling Shawn Tinsley, 3 1/2. Grandparents are Sheila A. Bader, Unity and Bob and Jane Geiger, Abbotsford."  Trampus?

       So all morning I've been on the verge of tears.  My once occasional waves of  urlLink fecklessness  have been coming with an increasing frequency and magnitude.   (Don't feel sorry though--apparently this makes me  urlLink trendy !)  About to have to tell the bosses that someone died, I was saved by the ever-reliable lunch bell in my head.  Down in the cafeteria at 11:30 on the f-ing dot, the usual choices just weren't doing it for me.  Turkey sandwich--blah, sushi--had it yesterday and don't want to die of mercury poisoning or whatever, soup--too healthy.  But there, glistening in all it's gelatinous glory, was the trough of egg salad.  Two scoops, two pieces of wheat bread, and two nearly pointless slivers of lettuce and tomato later, I had my pacifier.  Never in my life have I had an egg salad sandwich.  This is too bad because with the first bite of mayonnaisey eggs it was like there was a cold dark rain cloud in my head that turned into a cozy ray from a commercial high pressure tanning bed (not that I would, err, know anything about that.)  Hedonism to the temporary rescue once again.

       Oh my god, so a client just called and asked for a daily price quote for a certain bond.  I was like, "Uh, hold on a sec," and got the quote from this kid on the other side of the desk who does my job but for different bosses.  I think I should probably be able to discern this information myself by now, considering I'm liscensed to conduct securities business and all.  Then the client asks, "Oh wow, ok, so how do you feel about what Greenspan just said?"  I gave him an even longer "uhhhhh" and handed the phone to the other kid.  I thought I was on top of things just knowing that the mighty Greenspan had spoken.  Perhaps this is a sign that I should spend less time blogging and actually, like, pay attention or something.  Eesh.

       is actually FINISHING them.  Err, rather, it is reading snarky recaps on my new  urlLink favorite website .  Like my addictions to Marlboro Lights, Weissbier, burritos the size of my head, the Barney's Co-op, and boys in vintage t-shirts (hey, at least no drugs or gambling!), I should feel bad about my reality television addiction, but gosh darnit it makes me happy, so I don't.  The TWoP articles are quite long, so you'll need "one of those jobs" to enjoy them.  If you don't trust me or don't have the time, here are a couple of snippets from the latest  Real World  and  American Idol  snarkfests, respectively:  "Cameran interviews that Jackie seems like a nice girl (which is Cameran-ese for 'I'm about to say something really mean, so I have to preface it with something insincere') but that she is 'a little on the loose side.' Because she talks to boys in bars? And allegedly drinks beer? Wow, what a whore."  &  “Jamie interviews that Cameran is hating on Jackie, and that she should hate the player, not the game. No, she really said that. Is it 1999 and no one told me?”   “Diana will sing 'My Heart Will Go On.' Why? Whyyyyyy? This song choice just shows how sheltered and detached she is. Anybody with any interaction with human beings anywhere on earth would know that people couldn't possibly be sicker of this song.”  & "Next up is John Stevens. John's favorite movie is Disney's  Aladdin . Y'all realize you're not on ABC, right? You're not going to win any points with that one. And… Aladdin ? Come on. That's not even one of the top five Disney animated features. He loves it because it's fun and has great music. He likes the big parade scene in the movie. Is he on medication? Please tell me he's on some sort of medication. That somebody at the tender age of sixteen could be so dreadfully, painfully dull fills me with utter despair."  I doubt you will be shocked to learn that tonight I intend to watch both shows while smoking, drinking, eating a burrito, and wearing something overpriced with a  urlLink cute boy in a vintage t-shirt , provided he's not feeling antisocial and lazy.  Ahem.

       Like many recent college grads who neglected to go straight to school and have no imminent plans to do so, I've been thinking a little too much lately about what in god's name I should do with myself.  I took my current job partially because  urlLink the alternative  was unspeakable, and partially because I thought doing the last thing in the world I ever thought I'd do would be kind of amusing.   I do, indeed, laugh to myself when I walk into the sea of blue shirts and ties at 7:30am.  However, while I've actually learned quite a lot here--important skills like talking on two phones at once (still need to work on that one) and driving someone else's Benz through Midtown without hitting anything--and people seem to think I'd look good in (gooh!) a suit, I am not, and never will be, the corporate type.  This is sad because, on the one hand, this job has some serious future earning potential, and having money is neat because I like to buy stuff and go to far away places, but, on the other hand, I don't give a rat's ass about finance, and I'm really bad at being fake-nice to coworkers and clients that I have no other reason to care about.  (Also, I can write really long sentences of questionable grammatical accuracy.)  Could there be a way to reconcile this problem?  A way I could do this job well while enjoying it?  The answer, surprisingly, is yes.    This weekend I may have stumbled upon the solution to my existential dilemma.  On Saturday night I attended my  urlLink alma mater's  annual alumni crew banquet, located oh so inappropriately at the  urlLink Princeton (*gagging on my plastic spoon*) Club .  Note to Columbia:  You're the second largest land-owner in NYC--get your own freakin' club!  Anyway, there was of course an open bar, and due to the upsettingly low turnout, it was not at all difficult to maintain a nonstop influx of alcohol into my body, which was thirsty and dehydrated from the gallon or so of beer I drank the night before.  I learned from this that, when drunk, I can schmooze like it's my job.  Wait a second.....Eureka!  Essentially, schmoozing IS my job.  And hence, the answer:  I need to be drunk at work.  At the banquet, for some reason I alone was appointed to sell raffle tickets to the attendees.  Normally, this would scare the crap out of me, given my struggle with a moderate case of avoidant personality disorder (see  urlLink below .)  After a couple gin and tonics, however, I was able to chat up all these dudes that are probably quite rich and important.  I especially won the favor of one of the richest and most important--his last name is all over the boathouse--when I mentioned I liked his pants, an excellent red and blue plaid, in case you were wondering.  If I could get drunk at work, I would no longer be the quiet girl in the corner who looks sad, reads blogs instead of talking to people, and wears weird things like Converse shoes and faded denim jackets with the requisite Theory pants.  I would discuss the weather and baseball with the clients that call when my bosses are busy instead of putting them on hold.  I would ask people about their jobs while looking genuinely interested in pursuing a similar path for myself thus displaying my deep interest in the company.  I would bat my eyelashes at the traders to get a better price, and then my bosses would shower me with bonus money and make me a VP.  And then soon I would get my own clients, get rich, quit, and open up a coffee shop/rock 'n roll bar/dog shelter that I would staff with cute boys so that I'd be free to travel the world and run around in the park whenever I wanted.  Grad school schmad school.  Getting drunk at work is the best plan ever.

       There are only three paths I take to work in the morning:  subway, subway, walk five blocks; subway, subway, underground tunnel into my building (needless to say, I did not see the sun much this winter); and good old fashioned walking through The Park.  Oh, and when I'm really ridiculously hungover and sleep through the alarm I'll take a cab.  Today, however, was different.  The unfamiliar presence of sunlight this morning tricked me into thinking it would be warm enough to wear a skirt and flipflops.  Unfortunately, the 40 degree air kept me underground all the way to Grand Central, where I would normally proceed to the tunnel.  But it was just so purty outside that I decided to shake things up a bit and go through the Metlife building, which is two blocks from the office--short enough distance to retain the feeling in my legs, long enough to remind myself that there exists light of a non-flourescent variety.    I emerged from the building facing a tall, lanky boy with a Jewfro handing out free copies of the Financial Times.  One look at his feet--grey New Balance running shoes--and I recognized him instantly.  I "dated" the boy (let's call him Jacob, because that's his name) on and off for about a year in college.  He was always off on some bike trip across the country or a trip to Mexico or god knows what else, so it was never a full-blown relationship.  At least that's what he said until he got a real girlfriend at the end of said year.    Anywho, of all the quasi-relationships I've had (and I've had enough to swear off boys forever about eight times), this has been the one that stuck--the one that proved itself to be more than an initial physical connection that fizzled when it became clear there was nothing behind it.  Nevertheless, given Jacob's free-spirited nature, I hadn't heard from him in months.  So I went up to him and burst out laughing, partially because it was just so surprising and, and at the same time, not at all surprising to see him there, and partially because he was wearing a dorky Financial Times fleece baseball cap and trying unsuccessfully to get the dudes with suits and zhuzhed hair to take the paper.    As a pretty logical, scientific thinker, I don't buy into religion or spirituality or fate or any of that, and I know how to recognize a good old coincidence, but isn't it just so goddamn weird that the one day I veer from my usual path, I run into an elusive friend on a two-hour, one time temp job?  And it's all just so typically Jacob.  Anyway, turns out he's been accepted to grad school in NYC (yay!) and is continuing to drive a rickshaw (clearly, I'm not exactly a gold-digger) in Midtown until the fall.  So if you see a skinny, pretty-eyed, fluffy-haired boy hauling some tourists around behind a bicycle, throw him a buck or two so he can buy dinner instead of stealing olives from the cart at Fairway.

       Thanks, Sis, for sending me this excellent page of  urlLink Bushisms .  The sheer length of it alone should deter anyone from voting for Bush.  With this in mind, I forwarded the page to Fatboss, who is militantly right-wing.  He read about two sentences, closed the page, and said nothing (he sits an arm's length away from me.)  Despite my initial excitement at having a new boss--more things to do, bigger bonus, greater chance of getting a day off here and there, maybe--I am starting to wish it were just me, Mainboss, and Stereotypicalboss. Fatboss criticizes my sushi lunches for being too full of eeeevil carbohydrates while stuffing his face with meat and cheese slathered in mayonnaise, he whines incessantly about paying for his kid's impending Ivy education despite making over a million dollars a year, and, worst of all, his favorite phrase when upset (which is often) is "fuck me!"  This does not conjure up a pleasant image in my head.  If I were ever to think about sex at work, I would want it to be on my terms.  This means either whoever I have a crush on at the moment or rockstars.  Like  urlLink Jim , or  urlLink Michael , or  urlLink Jeff , or  urlLink Kurt , or even ones who haven't died tragically, like  urlLink Brandon , or  urlLink Pelle , or  urlLink Fab ...  Perplexa and I played this game via email yesterday and have only scratched the surface.  Who would you do?  (And how did I get from Dubya to sex with rockstars?)

Designed for lowrider enthusiasts, panty-line haters, and, well, anyone yearning for a little more freedom (who isn't?), it's a disposable patch of cotton flannel that you stick to the inside of your jeans when you're going commando, thereby protecting both the crotch of your pants and the crotch of your, um, self."  While this is an interesting idea, to say the least, would the kind of girl who goes commando in the first place be anal enough to purchase and affix a camouflage disc to the inside of her pants every day?  Weird.

       Going to LA for the weekend was certainly not the most rational thing I've ever done.  My thought process in purchasing the expensive last-minute ticket was pretty much as follows: "NY weather sucks.  NY boys suck.  LA is warm.  My sister lives there, and she does not suck."  Fortunately, the trip was worth every goddamn penny, down to the $34.16 tank of gas.  When I rolled into Dollar Rent-a-Car on Thursday evening, I was informed that I had a choice between a Dodge Neon and, for five dollars per day more, a Jeep Liberty.  I inquired as to why the rates were so much higher than what I'd seen earlier on the internet.  Turns out you need to "book in advance" to get the cheapness.  Interesting concept, indeed.  Since I was spending a lot regardless, and since the apparently clairvoyant  urlLink Drone  suggested it specifically the day before, I went all out with the  urlLink cooler car .  Despite having to navigate three freeways, I arrived at my sister's suburban utopia called Pomona College in a speedy 45 minutes.  There, I proceeded to sleep soundly for the next 11 hours, which, as those who know me know, is no small event.  In remembrance of Jesus Christ Our Lord's death for our sins, my sis and I spent Good Friday shopping on Melrose.  The first stop was a women's only sneaker store I'd read about in  urlLink Nylon  on the plane ride, where I finally found a suitable  urlLink replacement  for my poor old beloved Pumas.  Next, we actually walked (apparently this is not done in LA) to the cavernous thrift store Jet Rag.  We were greeted by  urlLink my first LA star-sighting , who I of course stared at like an idiot, walking down the stairs.  After taking the requisite photos of ourselves in silly outfits, which I'll post if I figure out how (anyone??), I bought some very Gina items (i.e., most suitable for a 10-year-old boy in 1973), and my sister found a vintage dress deemed "awesome" by the trendy checkout girl.  How proud I was!  Then it was down the road--in the Jeep this time, natch--to  urlLink where the beautiful people are .  Good little liberal arts student that she is, my sister's first reaction upon entering Fred Segal was to note, "This place is so post-modern."  Before she could explain this statement for me--I have become certifiably retarded post-college--a force of heretofore unknown strength pulled me into the corner.  There, gleaming like an angel sent from Above, was my holy (or hole-y, as it were) grail.  The.  perfect.  jeans.  Ever since Perplexa's thrift store Levi's became too scandalous to wear, I've been on a mission to find some faded, paint-splattered, tight ass, buttcrack-covering jeans of my own.  I am now the proud owner of a replica of the 1970  urlLink Levi's  684 Big Bells, with strategically placed holes and stains and a pricetag about 40 times that of Perplexa's.  Sis proclaimed these post-modern as well.  And I fucking love them.  We declared the day a success and returned to campus.  The boyfriend-in-law joined us for a trip to Pitzer, the neighboring crunchy hippie school, where we stumbled upon a Pretty Girls Make Graves concert.  If only Columbia's concert planners could be so indie...  Then I took the kiddies to dinner in The Village (not anything like my The Village, as it's basically a retirement community.)  After dinner, our cute-ish waiter overheard our conversation about shots, and offered us a free round of some damn good whiskey.  My sister took it like a champ, and, once again, made me beam with pride.  After another 10 or 11 hours of sleep and a consultation with the internet weather gods, we determined Saturday was park day.  Sis and I drove the Jeep out to the ocean and up the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu.  As it was too cold for the beach, we headed straight to the Palisades for a picnic of avocado and white cheddar on a baguette and tangerines and strawberries.   We worked off the yummy fat bomb with a relatively easy hike that my measly schedule of two spinning classes a week failed to prepare me for.  The ride home took us through Brentwood (OJ!) and the v. v. gated Belaire.  During the many hours spent driving over the course of the trip, I learned I have a minor obsession with  urlLink really old light blue cars .  I want one, preferably parked in the driveway of my house in the Hollywood Hills.  (Someone remind me not to quit my job.)  Back at school, my sister had to go to a play for her theatre class.  Pomona really hearts queers and really really hates hate, so it was not surprising that they were showing  urlLink Bent , a play about the treatment of gays during the Holocaust.  The actors weren't amazing, but they certainly surpassed the William Hungish kid who had to read the orgasm scene in my college creative writing class.  Then I packed, said goodbye to my sis and her friends I've come to know, and drove off into the night feeling all profound listening to Modest Mouse's  Moon and Antarctica , as it was just made for driving on a dark highway by yourself.  After one miserable flight and one pleasant one, on Sunday morning I was welcomed home by a panoramic view of the city from the plane, a delicious three hour nap, and an even more delicious dinner of homemade bacon-wrapped lamb and blueberry cheesecake, courtesy of two old (not old old, Z) friends.  While the weather still sucks, and boys still suck, my existence here is suddenly both fresh and comforting again.

       So much blog goodness today!  Here are some links for now, and I'll write about my excellent trip (and consider doing some work...oh and my taxes...shit) after lunch.  *Play with the  urlLink Subservient Chicken .  He'll do whatever you tell him to, except anything naughty or involving bending too much at the waist.  *After winning an Ebay auction for rocks from the hometown of Avril Lavigne,  urlLink Stereogum  created a  urlLink shrine to the punk heroine in his office .  I'd love to do something similar here, but for some reason I don't think the irony would be fully appreciated.  * urlLink This story  about a child prodigy is kind of disturbing.  Is taking chemistry and abstract algebra at UPenn as a 12-year-old really such a good thing?  And doesn't the last sentence ("a collection of four chicken pieces.  In the classical style.") sound more like a KFC entree description?   *By some cruel twist of fate, the one weekend I leave NYC, America's Next Top Model herself invades my neighborhood.   urlLink Yoanna House was a mere half a block from MY house!!!   [many many thanks,  urlLink Midwestgrrl ]  Woah, I just noticed that three of these four links in some way involve chicken.  And I plan on having  urlLink chicken tacos  for dinner tonight.  Coincidence?  Evidence of an impending chicken apocalypse??

       In approximately thirty minutes I and my corporate expense account car voucher will be on the way to the airport.  Because I clearly have an aversion to exhibiting any semblance of financial reponsbility, I decided on a whim to go to LA this weekend.  What a fabulous excuse to  urlLink buy   urlLink some   urlLink new  (and not so new)  urlLink CD's , increase my chances of skin cancer, and reminisce about the Vaterland with my sister.  In my absence, I recommend amusing yourself with the following:  *From  urlLink NITBC :  "You know its bad when an infant is more A-List than you can ever hope to be. Check out  urlLink Who is that with Jeremy  for the newest trend in child exploitation. Babies aren't just for sewing clothing in third world countries anymore!"  *One of my old favorites that you've probably seen, but there are new  urlLink prinsoners to write to  nearly every day!   urlLink This one  would actually be kinda hot if he cut his hair...   *Figure out what to do with your life.  According to  urlLink this test , I, being Introverted, Realistic, Intellectual, and Easygoing, am supposed to be a surveyor, fire fighter, private investigator, pilot, police officer, purchasing agent, chiropractor, medical technician, securities analyst, computer repair person, race car driver, computer programmer, electrical engineer, legal secretary, coach/trainer, commercial artist, carpenter, paralegal, dental assistant, radiological technician, marine biologist, software developer.  I'll take race car driver.  The rest sounds like a  urlLink Sally Struthers  correspondence school commercial...

       According to the  urlLink ABC Bizarre-chives  [thanks,  urlLink Fark ], "the mourning dove -- the brownish and gray bird designated during the Vietnam era as Wisconsin's symbol of peace -- can be hunted like any other wild game, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday."  As you can see  urlLink here , the mourning dove bears not a small resemblance to the official bird of NYC, the beloved pigeon.  "Gross!  Who would want to eat a pigeon?" you may be saying to yourself.  Well, after dining at  urlLink Blue Ribbon , which I very highly recommend, I can attest that pigeons are absolutely delicious.  And, symbol of peace or not, I have not had much sympathy for the flying vermin since one dive-bombed me in the back of the head one morning on the way home from crew practice a couple years back.

       This season of the  urlLink Real World , I gotta say, has been a little lackluster.  Other than acquiring disorderly conduct arrests here and there, this cast does nothing but get trashed and bitch about having to be at work by noon.  Cry me a river.  However, last night's dramafest was simply hilarious.  With maybe an  urlLink exception  and a  urlLink half , these people are so vacuous that you can almost see the proverbial wheels turning while they try to comprehend a serious issue like self-mutilation, and they ain't turning very fast.  In case you may have missed it (God forbid!) this episode revealed that Frankie, along with suffering from cystic fibrosis, cheating on her boyfriend, and having a crippling fear of large sea-faring vessels, is.....a cutter!  I don't think the producers could have found a more animated character (and I don't just say this because she frequently resembles a  urlLink Thundercat .)  While I particularly enjoyed the forced display of tenderness from Randy the Meathead and the fact that Jaime sounds and looks uncannily like the  urlLink Asian Fashion Club girl  from Daria, the highlight for me was a quote to Frankie from Robin, whose fake boobs seem to grow larger with every passing episode:  "You don't, like, wanna die do you?"

       *This is just plain wrong:   urlLink J. Lo's Mother Wins $2.4M at N.J. Casino    *Today I'm wearing a skirt, so, for once, there are no open zipper or button issues.  I did, however, just discover that my undies are on inside out.  It's time to join Beltless Andrew in starting a nudist colony for those who are incapable of dressing themselves.  *This  urlLink Times article  is kind of annoying.  Is it really shocking anyone that some college kids work too much at the expense of their mental health?  How do you think they got into college in the first place?  Most students learn how to deal with the requisite stress and needn't be coddled.  Those who do lose it would probably not have been saved by attending more massage study breaks.  Though I must say, I wouldn't have minded if my school, a la Bowdoin, had provided me with a puppy to cheer me up during reading week.  *Lastly, is my  urlLink apartment 's terrace more  urlLink Evening Serenade  or  urlLink Summer Island ?

       Until frighteningly recently, all I ever knew about Judaism I learned from  urlLink my favorite Judy Blume book .  There were no Jews in my  urlLink Catholic grade school , of course, and I recall being shocked to learn that the two Goldbergs in my public high school were Jewish.  Before being enlightened by my darling college roommate (ummm, Perplexa, what's a seder?), "jew," for me, was equivalent to "hannukah."  Therefore, I am delighted to see that the Local Paper is making an effort to educate the ignorant readership about Passover.  I'm sure you will find  urlLink this article  to be as comprehensive and informative as I have.  They even found one real live Jew to interview!   And, I must say, that last sentence really just captures the spirit of the holiday.

       Now that I've had enough blog posts to garner some Google hits, I thought I'd share them with you.  Thanks,  urlLink BlogPatrol !  There are many many hits for both  urlLink Yoanna House  and  urlLink Ultragrrrl , the latter of which I had the pleasure of meeting at about 3 am this Saturday night, shortly after Mike Joyce of the Smiths grabbed her ass.  Then there are a couple of folks just trying to realize their life goals:  "johnny depp needs 300 naked extras auditions" and "i want a famous face audition."  The rest I could've seen coming from a mile away:  "female viagina," "overstimulating viagina," and, my personal favorite, "what is safe to put in your viagina."  Really I'm just amazed that some people have such poor spelling.  (Don't worry, RJ, I love you regardless)

       I'm feeling far too uninspired today to write much of anything, as work has been unusually busy (i.e., I've actually had to do more than five minutes of actual work) and I'm in one of my delightful ~24-hour depressive states.  After tonight's lineup of spinning class, Burritoville chicken tacos with extra guac and no pico, and a cat fight-filled episode of   urlLink The Inferno  , I should be back to normal by tomorrow.  In accordance with my mood, here is the only thing I've read today that's inspired any emotional reaction whatsoever.  I'm not veg anymore, and I can handle that we omnivorous humans kill animals for  urlLink yummy food  and the  urlLink best boots ever , but I can't help but wonder who the hell could  urlLink club a baby seal to death ?

       Your 300+ pound boss proclaims "Oh my God, you ate all those fries?"    I will consume anything that ketchup can be put on until the ketchup is gone.  And since  urlLink Burger Heaven  sent about 30 packets along with the office's Friday meat extravaganza, I was a lost cause even though I was already full post turkey burger.  Apologies in advance to anyone I whine to about feeling fat this weekend.  Speaking of turkeys, I thought this blurb in the  urlLink local paper  was rather amusing:  * Animal problem A 49-year-old Marshfield woman reported a wild turkey was causing damage inside her house at 3:02 p.m. Tuesday in the 800 block of West Omaha Street. The turkey apparently broke a living room window to enter the house and broke another window on the opposite side. The bird was taken to the McMillan Marsh and released.  Speaking of wild turkey, my main boss just returned from a nap downstairs in the nurse's office.  Apparently he had a little too much to drink last evening at oh-so-trendy  urlLink Spice Market , spent the night at the Palace Hotel because he was too trashed to make it home to  urlLink Westport , and required a wakeup call from yours truly to get to work this morning.  I would not be so annoyed at all of this if 1. I was fucking invited and 2. I got to take a nap in the nurse's office every other day when I'm hungover at work.

       Breaking news this weekend from the  urlLink New York Times : teens have sexual relations outside the confines of committed relationships!  Also, the earth revolves around the sun.  Speaking of crazy kids these days, I have acquired a new addiction, perhaps more detrimental than smoking, drinking, and burritos the size of my head. Yes, folks, I am a  urlLink Degrassi  fan.  For the uninitiated, it's a Canadian kids' series, kind of like Saved By the Bell but more risque and without all the neon colors.  I started watching the N Channel because it's been showing wonderful My So-Called Life episodes, and, well, one thing led to another and before you know it I'm glued to the Degrassi Every Episode Ever Marathon, and now I feel compelled to stay home this Friday to catch the premier episode of the new season.  If the previews are any indication, there is going to be some DRAMA.

       Kind of like that winter break during which I went to Europe and had to pretend Christmas did not exist, I keep telling myself that Monday is just another day and everyone will not be off frolicking on a beach somewhere.  Only this time, rather than accidentally eating pats of butter in a Parisian cafe and drunkenly hiccupping through the streets of London with  urlLink Drone , I will be cramming 1,000 multiple choice questions relating to "Uniform Securities Agent State Law" (whatever the hell that is) into my severly atrophied brain.  Unlike school exams which are passable with minimal to no studying and a reasonable amount of intelligence, finance licensing exams actually require work to pass, because no one in their right mind would have any knowledge of this information, because no one in their right mind, including those who work in the industry, ever needs to know it.  Who wants to get wasted with me next Thursday so I can erase everything I've learned to free up my limited mental space?

       This  urlLink make your own movie site  is among the most exciting links I have ever come across.  [via  urlLink Number One Hit Song ]  What better way to kill the hours between lunch and the time your stomach is able to accomodate a snack?     urlLink Here , in my first attempt at cinematic glory, last night's raucous antics are painstakingly chronicled.    And  urlLink here  is what might have transpired if I'd done otherwise, based on the last several years of my life.  Note:  If I were a creative person, I'd certainly make these about something far more interesting than myself.  But, alas, this is not the case.

       Though I'm typically too engrossed in my extensive blog research and analysis to pay attention to real people around here, I should mention that I am not the only youngish lady in this big testosterone cesspool of an office.  In fact, there are four of us brave enough to dodge the flying footballs, resist the lunchtime steak and pizza pigouts, and not find sexist jokes and stripper talk offensive enough to sue anyone.  Who are these fabulous gals?  Well, I'll tell you.  *Me first!:  Aversion to bullshit is almost as severe as my aversion to cilantro.  Unlike the latter, this aversion cannot be tempered by gradually increasing my intake of Burritoville salsa until I can almost tolerate it.  This means I will never be a good go-getting team-player.  Also, even though I spend most of my income on overpriced clothing, I cannot bring myself to buy anything business casual and, therefore, wear the same five outfits every week.  Can also not bring myself to shower in the morning and always wear my hair curly (gasp!) and in a ponytail.  *Really cool girl who I would be friends with if I were less shy and/or not too lazy to walk to the other side of the office:  Has been here for three years, totally knows her shit, and is nice and friendly in an un-bullshitty way.  Wears fairly funky, colorful outfits and once told me she really just wants to work with kids.  *Princeton girl:  Is a size -2 yet somehow manages to have large, perfectly shaped boobs.  Has perfect, frizz-free blonde hair and a perfect, exclusively Theory wardrobe.  Flirts with trader dudes like it's her job (errr...) and eats coffee for breakfast and Diet Dr. Pepper for lunch.  *New girl:  Graduated my year from Schmarvard, starred in a Broadway show when my biggest life accomplishment was getting a silver medal at the regional spelling bee, and is absurdly nice to everyone.  Wears boring business suits every day even though it is completely unnecessary, reads a giant book that says "Bonds" on it when she should be reading blogs, and never lets the gumball machine run out of Peanut M&M's.  Maybe it's just Fatboss' low-carb lunch, but I think I smell an overachiever.  Guess which one gets to go on all the fancypants limousined client dinner extravaganzas.  Hint: it sure ain't the new girl.    Disclaimer: I know how lucky I am to have this job (oh so extremely lucky, seriously), and it's not really terrible.  If it were an estrogen-filled cesspool instead of a testosterone-filled cesspool, I think I would have been committed to Bellevue after about a week.  Nevertheless, I will still make fun of it at every opportunity and pray to the Holy Father that no one here ever reads this.

       Here's another gem from the  urlLink Local Paper .  Usually the weekly "Hi, My Name Is" column supplies me with a nice healthy dose of schadenfreude and humorous inanity, but this one just makes me sad.  If the Metro Channel ever does a " urlLink To Live and Date  in Dairyland" series, they should call this girl.      Hi, my name is   Promise Bakken Age: 18 Home: Pittsville Occupation: student at Pittsville High School  What was your most memorable dream?  My most memorable dream would have been when I thought I lived in Ohio, and I lived in this huge house and I had three children, and we were happy. It was a really happy dream.  What's your favorite word?  I have a favorite phrase. 'Life sucks and then you die.'  If you had one superpower, what would it be?  To make any man in the world I wanted love me.  What are you most passionate about?  I'm not really a passionate person. But if I had to pick something: Divorce. I personally believe people never should marry in their entire lives, even if they live together, because of divorce.  Who is your hero?  My hero would be my brother, Randy, because he taught me so many things about life.   Randy, what have you done??

       So the Company Computer Nazis are back in full force.  Certain pages of Craigslist have been blocked since day one (no Casual Encounters for me, sadly), but now the whole site is contraband.  I will love forever the person who emails me the Best Ofs when it's updated, because, hilarious as it is, reading that shit on my precious free time would be just sad.  Not that what I do with my precious free time is any less sad.  Anyway.  I'm not taking the Craigs blockage too harshly because this morning I came across a new (to me) excellent website.   urlLink Erin's Livejournal  [via  urlLink Stereogum ] is hilarious--so hilarious that she's in some kind of blog contest on  urlLink Nerve . Of course, I wouldn't know anything about that because the CCN blocked that one a looong time ago.  Prudish bastards.  Anyway, this is my favorite post of hers so far, as it so eloquently addresses one of my biggest pet peeves:    "Thursday, April 1st, 2004 11:33 am  all my paper bag ladies  when i was in 7th grade you couldn't bring your gym clothes or diorama on the history of the soybean to school in any old bag. it had to be a COOL bag.   acceptable bags: the limited, limited express, benetton, DEB, the gap, rave, banana republic unacceptable bags: jc penney, kmart, giant eagle grocery, big lots  i remember mornings where i almost missed the bus because i was rooting through the pantry for the appropriate bag while telling my mom that a walgreens bag just wasn't going to cut it and to shut the fuck up because she doesn't know anything.  by high school i had scrapped keeping up with the joneses and carried my shit in a backpack decorated with band names written in marker because i wanted to let the world know i am a rebel and my music is important to me (not that you'd ever understand my music).  graduating from school and going into the work force i forgot about bags. when you live in a city dominated by cars people just use purses and briefcases and that's about it. bags are a makeshift solution to a temporary transportation problem. purses and briefcases are different. they're for things you bring with you every day - house keys, wallet, butt plug, etc.  in new york everyone commutes and no one has cars to put stuff in so there's a big proportion of people who bring their stuff to work in bags. most of them are still stuck in the 7th grade mode. the bag has to be from a COOL PLACE. no matter how old & tattered it is. no matter how inappropriate.   so you'll see married businessmen with lunches in little pink striped victoria's secret bags who don't seem to realize that looks weird at 8 in the morning and other people are thinking they're a pervert and really they just bought the wifey something nice for their anniversary. you'll see ghetto bird boys and girls who look like they can barely afford a Metrocard but somehow have a huge prada bag with them that's carrying anything but actual clothes.   when i see them i feel bad and weird. it instantly takes me back to the time when i used to be so caught up in that competitive bullshit. i want to shake them and scream 'WE DON'T CARE! WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT YOUR ATTRACTIVENESS OR SOCIAL STANDING BECAUSE OF YOUR BAG. THROW OUT THE GUCCI BAG AND USE THE DUANE READE ONE BECAUSE IT HOLDS MORE STUFF AND ISN'T FALLING APART BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT IT THREE YEARS AGO AND IT'S BEEN HOLDING YOUR TUNA FISH ON RYE EVER SINCE'."    Amen, sister.

       * urlLink Week in Craig :  Craigslist is like the American Idol of the internet--so painfully bad and guilt-inducing but I just. can't. stop.  And yes, yes, making fun of it...candy from a baby...but Amy Blair is just so darn good at making fun of it.    * urlLink Dooce :  It took me a while to get into this apparently very popular blog, as my fear of babies and small, screaming children rivals my fear of moths and other large, winged insects.  But the  urlLink How To Annoy Me  archive carried me through till ham 'n muenster panini time, and the rest is damn good, too.  * urlLink Wasabi peas :  Why are dried lentils coated in dried horseradish paste so addictive?  My stomach hates me right now.  But the tingling sensation in the back of my head and the water dripping from my nose are far more effective stimulants than caffeine.  *Crowding around Fatboss' computer to watch a live, high-speed L.A. car chase.

Over a week ago I wrote my  urlLink no time to blog  post, which said:  "I've noticed an alarming trend in the blogosphere recently. Everyone, it seems, suddenly has better things to do...One can only hope this is just a passing sun-induced mania or something."    Today, they  urlLink write :    "I've noticed a similar drop off in content at several other blogs of note, and it just has to be the return of the sun."    Is my finger on the f-in pulse or what?  If only my bond sales skills came as naturally as my blog analysis talent...

Now where will that crazy Kiefer turn up next?  Speaking of celebs with weirdo names, I feel it is my duty as resident onomastics expert (thanks, Andrew and dictionary.com) to regurgitate the  urlLink New Yorkish list  of the most onomastically unfortunate celebrity offspring.  All I have to say is who the hell is Paula Yates, and why did she get to have sex with Michael Hutchence?  Victoria Adams/David Beckham: Brooklyn Woody Allen/Soon-Yi Previn: Bechet Dumaine, Manzie Tio Forest Whitaker: Ocean, Sonnet, True Gillian Anderson/Clyde Klotz: Piper Maru Erykah Badu/Andre 3000: 7 (Seven) Robby Benson/Karla DeVito: Zephyr, Lyric Marisa Berenson: Starlite Bruce Willis/Demi Moore: Rumer Glenn, Scout LaRue, Tallulah Belle  Bjork: Sindri Donald Sutherland: Roeg, Rossif David Byrne: Malu David Carradine/Barbara Hershey: Free (he changed it to Tom) Mia Farrow: Lark Song, Summer Song Jerry Garcia/Manasha Matheson: Keelin Bob Geldof/Paula Yates: Fifi Trixiebelle, Peaches Honeyblossom, Little Pixie Michael Hutchence/Paula Yates: Heavenly Hiraani Tigerlily Geena Davis: Kian, Kaiis Snoop Doggy Dogg: Chordé Nikki Sixx: Gunner, Decker, Storm  Connie Sellecca: Gib, Prima Sellechia Shari Shattuck: Creason Carbo, Calee Maudine Damon Wayans: Fuddy, Trixie Frank Zappa: Moon Unit, Ahmet Emuukha Rodan, Dweezil, Diva  Robert Downey, Jr.: Indio John Mellencamp: Hud, Speck Wildhorse  UPDATE:  I just made fun of an  urlLink apparent suicide victim .  Now waiting patiently for my handbasket.

       Aaaah, life.  So funny sometimes.  You work so hard to get to the top of something until you finally become one of the biggest, baddest kids around, and then you graduate and get thrown back down to the bottom of a pile that is exponentially larger than the last. Yesterday in  urlLink spinning class  (say what you will, but it's the only way i can get my lazy ass to the gym), the chick next to me was complaining about the heat, and the mid-to-late-thirty-something instructor says, "But sweat is good for you.  Look at her [referring to me and my copious perspiration, probably a result of my copious Marlboro Lights consumption] and how young she looks.  Then again, she's probably, like, 12."    For me, the transition from big, bad high school senior to lowly college freshman was an easy one, as it was aided by much tea from Long Island and a new  urlLink intense (i.e., masochistic) passion .  The trasition from big, bad college senior to one whose skin elasticity inspires jealousy in mid-to-late-thirty-something spinning instructors has not been so easy.  Somehow I'd gotten the crazy assumption that by 22 I'd have figured out some things.   urlLink Some   urlLink things  have indeed been learned, but I feel like I knew myself better when I was a teenager.  I was a granola lovin' vegan, studied foreign languages for fun, planned to go to college in my favorite city, and was going to be Very Rich and Important.  Now, I eat my bagels with cream cheese and smoked fish, can barely even remember English grammar, much less Russian, have "plans" for the future that last about a week and a half, and am probably going to give up a career that provides an easy path to become Very Rich, if not also Important.  In the past I'd always been working toward something and belonged somewhere, and now it's like I'm floating aimlessly in a little bubble (a fun bubble, at least) and have no fucking clue when it'll pop and where I'll land.    Okay, that's enough trite cheesiness for one day.  If, by any chance, it didn't sufficiently nauseate you, I'll end with this:  Yesterday I saw Fatboss, who sits an arm's length away from me, Q-TIPPING HIS EAR.  The inside of his ear canal.  Next to me.  At his desk.  During the work day.  Am I just being old-fashioned, or is that not really kosher?

       *The  urlLink new Loretta Lynn CD  is as awesome as  urlLink they say , especially when combined with a dear friend, a loud spring thunderstorm, and some cans of Bud and a pack of cigarettes.  If I can be 1/100th as cool as this woman is when I'm her age, I shall consider my life a success.  *The Bermuda Triangle is not a myth, and it is located at the intersection of West 72nd Street and West End Avenue.  On Sunday afternoon I watched with decreasing patience as approximately eight busses headed toward said intersection, where they are supposed to turn around and pick up east-bound passengers on Broadway, never to return.  At least not until the second after I'd given up and hailed a cab.  *I'm so in love with this goddamn city it's ridiculous.  The feeling I get wandering around outside on a mild, sunny day in NYC is nothing less than orgasmic.  However, like many lovers (not that I've had many,) it never ceases to piss me off almost as much as it makes me happy (see above.)  I wouldn't trade my lime green 144 square foot box o' fun for the world.  At least not for another two years, according to the lease I just signed.  *Check out my badass girls at the starting line of their final race, about to win the darn thing.  I do miss rowing very much, but I absolutely do not miss making the anticipating-the-most-intense-mental-and-physical-pain-you've-ever-felt-in-your-entire-life face right before the start.  Just thinking about it makes me almost need to go to the ladies' room.

       Just saw my bosses' boss perusing Craigslist personals ads.  (This man is referred to as a "hound" by my bosses, which is indeed an accomplishment, as one of them mentioned today that he makes up for his height deficiency below the waist while nearly hitting me in the head with a rubber football.)  Also, BB just asked me to come out for drinks with work people, which I am not inclined to do, since, like  urlLink Midwestgrrl , I am extremely piggy about my Fridays.  I was going to suck it up, but then when I wanted to leave without getting an account number which could just as easily be gotten on Monday, Mainboss reamed me out for my poor work ethic.  How I don't show enthusiasm for the business, always want to leave at 5 (god forbid!), yadda yadda yadda.  He's a smart one, Mainboss.  If only I could wake up tomorrow morning, loins burning with a passion for government bonds, I would be flying my helicopter to the Hamptons in no time.  But I just don't think it's gonna happen.  Now where did I store those dog leashes and doody bags?

       Some of  urlLink these  are funny, some are  urlLink just plain sad , and some are both, like the singer/songwriter girl Perplexa and I saw at C-Note last night.   urlLink This girl  was like a watered-down, acoustic Jewel, who was such a cliche she was almost a satire of herself, but, unfortunately, she was so serious we couldn't help but mock nearly every word out of her mouth ("Umm, this next song is about my ex-boyfriend.")  Perplexa's friend Chaya even made up her own ditty, singing "I have a vaginaaaaaa, I have a vaginaaaaaa" in a high-pitched voice while making a guitar-strumming motion.  This is probably one of those "you had to be there" stories, but it was so hilarious I nearly wet my Diesels.  Do it yourself and just try not to laugh.  Anyway, after far too many minutes of this, we started feeling like bad people (after all, she seemed like a nice girl) and just had to relocate.  Speaking of annoying people with vaginas, yesterday after work I found myself on a crowded Times Square subway platform, as usual.  A mousy, Marie Claire subscriber type woman shuffled along slowly in front of me, and I accidentally kicked her wedge rubber flip flop such that it flew off her foot and slid about five feet in front of her.  I apologized immediately, but she turned around and snapped loudly enough that I could hear over my headphones, "Thanks a LOT! I really appRECiated that!"  Dude!  You're walking on a Times Square subway platform on a rainy day during rush hour wearing wedge rubber flip flops.  Worse things have happened.  Just glare at the offender like a normal, jaded New Yorker and get on with your life.  Crap like this is what causes me to walk the two miles home at every opportunity and, subsequently, consider that a workout and never go to the gym.  My cellulitey thighs are all your fault, mousy Marie Claire lady!

       I've noticed an alarming trend in the blogosphere recently.  Everyone, it seems, suddenly has better things to do than distract me from thinking about the gaping hole in my life that Meaning and Purpose used to fill.  One can only hope this is just a passing sun-induced mania or something.  I present the following samples as evidence.  * urlLink Eurotrash :  "Well, I've been a little busy, which has been a huge culture shock. I actually had to go out and buy an alarm clock on the weekend, after seeing a doctor to have my pyjamas surgically removed. On Sunday night I had to set my new alarm clock. And then I had to wake up to it's piercing yell early on Monday morning. And then I had to get dressed in grown-up clothes and commute into the city. I am still quivering from the ordeal."  * urlLink Maccers :  "Now I am lucky enough to be blissfully happy in my work environment. Until I fuck up and it’s my fault and I am exposed as having an advanced case of Alzheimer’s for someone of such tender skin around the eye area. Then I exhibit symptoms of low self-esteem around the office until the boss rips 10 tons of shit out of me about my new Cruella De Ville hairdo and I can go back to websurfing all day. Yay."  * urlLink Lindsay :  "Obviously, when it comes to this blog I've been phoning it in lately (in the traditional sense, not in some 'now you can update your blog through your phone' sort of way). So I've decided to get a guest blogger."  * urlLink Choire :  "Oh, shit!  I have a website!  I totally forgot.  My bad.  But when the freelance comes, you say, 'Yes, please, may I have another?  Ooh, yeah, you know I like it like that!  Whoo!  Spank it!  Twerk it!'"  * urlLink Smitten :  "Sometimes I fear that by posting daily, I am exchanging quantity for quality. I often say that I am going to post less, edit more, and spend more time ruminating on the bit parts, but it never works out that way because I always find some juicy gossip I am itching to share with you. However, if you were to see less of me in the coming weeks, understand that I am not trying to disentangle myself from you, Sweet Internet, I simply adore you enough that I want to give you the best."    I'm very happy for all you happy folks, but please please please don't stop!  Kind of relatedly, in searching for the link to Smitten's site, I stumbled upon the most pray-to-jesus-it's-a-joke invention ever.  Ladies and Gentlemen, behold......the  urlLink Smitten Mitten !

          This picture is a shout out to  urlLink Drone , who always says he wants to pick up fat chihuahuas and sqeeze them until they squeak.  In a loving way, of course.  I wouldn't mind having this trio of so-ugly-they're-cute things guarding my apartment against future invasions.  Anyway, I had quite a lovely weekend--so lovely, in fact, that I'm going to blather on about it for a while and probably bore you.    On Saturday day Perplexa and I wandered around Nolita, where I failed to find a single thing I wanted to purchase--a rare phenomenon, indeed.  I got to live vicariously through Perplexa by being the devil on her shoulder as she decided to buy an overpriced but insanely cute jacket/hoodie thing at the  urlLink Vice  store.  After the requisite stop for corn and plantains at  urlLink Habana , we headed to the Upper East to visit her amazing 94-year-old Austrian grandmother.  She gave us cookies, a little German lesson, and stories of her drunken escapades as an 18-year-old in Paris.  (I can only hope that in 70 years I'll be regaling my grandkids with the tale of Grandma making out with a hot French chef in a cab on the Westside Highway and then puking out the window.)    Anywho, after a nap and a gross but effective vodka concoction, Perplexa and I met up with our  urlLink cool job -having friend Jeff for the interesting and awesome  urlLink Tracy and the Plastics  show at the Knitting Factory.  You can read a pretentious review  urlLink here .  As the weather was for once not crappy, we walked up to the West Village to the  urlLink Misshapes  party.  We danced like maniacs to our favorite music for about four hours, which is probably longer than all the times I've danced in my entire life combined.  And we only fell to the floor in a tangled mess once!  Just about every blogger in the world was there it seemed, and I managed to hold my drunk ass back and only accost  urlLink the   urlLink british   urlLink brigade .  The  urlLink one I actually know  showed up a little later and obliged my request to get drunk enough to dance with me.  He took this pic of me and my future bride in civil union.       I made it home for a brief nap until I was awakened with a phone call from last year's team captain.  Just like the old days, only this time my still drunk ass was hauled to Penn Station and not the bus to the river (might as well just say that the sport is rowing since almost everyone reading this already knows that.)  The weather in the Jerz was beautiful, I saw lots of old friends, and didn't even catch a glimpse of PEG.  This probably had something to do with the fact that she completetly avoided our school's tent.  I also spoke with one of the Offended Older Alums, who was very nice and even suggested an alumni gathering in the city sometime.  Awesome, but I will certainly not be sending out that invite.  At least not to PEG.  But most importantly, Columbia, totally not true to form, KICKED SOME ASS!!!  During the race I was screaming "oh my god oh my god" so loudly that the girls heard me, and I was so happy for them I almost cried.  Then I returned home to nurse my atrocious but very worth it headache.

       I'm not awake enough yet (even though I went to bed at the geriatric time of 9:15 last night) to gush about my delightful, drunken, un-depressifying weekend, so here is another installment from my lil' sis.  I think it is pretty self-explanatory.   Mr. Rogers + Bloody Grocer = Marshfield, Wisconsin   Normally I resist the urge to mass-email [Ed: be careful with those  urlLink mass-emails , little one] articles from my hometown newspaper. But this one is special (special enough to give me a nervous twitch), and I really felt it needed to go to everyone I know.   I now know why I've suffered from shyness and maladjustment these twenty years. You can't grow up in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and be entirely stable.  For those of you lucky enough to read previous articles, know that this (almost) trumps Carol Nutter Engelhart's  urlLink Encounter With Boy Scouts At Lake Okoboji .   Behold " urlLink Neighborhoods are source of neighborliness ," brought to you by the editors of the Marshfield News-Herald.  PS. To my fellow Marshfieldians: Ask for me this summer, and you shall find me hiding in my basement with a candle and a shotgun.

           There is really not enough space on this thing devoted to boys.  And I certainly don't want to give anyone the wrong idea--that boys are not, in fact, what I think about 85% of the time.  (The other 15% is split 14 to 1 between eating and miscellany, respectively, in case you were wondering.)  So anyway, the last three years have been filled with an almost endless string of extended flings (except for that 6-month dry spell junior year, but let's just forget about that.)  Generally, I'll make out with a cute guy the instant I decide I like him, and then continue to do so periodically for anywhere from one to four months until one of us (usually the guy) realizes there's really not too much there beyond the making out part.  Then, to get over that one, I line up a new one, realize that I was deluded in thinking the last one ever would have gone anywhere, and the cycle continues.  All of this hasn't turned me into a total pessimist, per se, but I'm definitely a little emotionally hardened.  Nevertheless, what happened yesterday turned me into a big, warm 'n fuzzy bowl of mush.  The main reason Perplexa and I decided on Montreal as a weekend getaway locale was because she has a friend, who is a boy, there from her study abroad summer in Spain.  They've kept in touch for the last two years, and now, after graduating from some big college in Canada, he lives in Montreal with his cousins.  Basically, he is tall and cute and has the nicest sounding voice.  If there's one characteristic that's an instant "turn on" (sorry, don't mean to get all  urlLink Cosmo  up in here) for me, it's a nice, soothing voice.  And he speaks French.  And some other things that I find appealing, like a love of television and the ability to spell "definitely" correctly.  So obviously I really wanted to make out with him.  Logistics (i.e., sleeping on the floor of his cousins' apartment, although, as  urlLink FAB  can attest, such inconveniences have not stopped me in the past) didn't allow for that this weekend, however, but I confessed my desire to Perplexa upon our return.  Then yesterday she received the following in an email from him:   i like your friend, do you think it's reciprocal.....things were simple in 6th grade when you passed a note to your "love interest" and asked her to profess her interest by checking the "yes" box.   Genius.  I like a boy, he likes me, and there's no way I can fuck anything up, because he lives in another country.  Why did it take so long to figure this out?

       Feeling too discombobulated to post anything substantial (as opposed to....), but here's what's on my mind today:  *Now that I'm in the market for a new computer, I'm thinking about joining the Cult of Mac.   urlLink These  are just so cute, and if I got an Ipod I could have such an extensive and organized music collection, which is really what I'd mainly use the computer for in the first place.  If you have any strong opinions one way or the other, please let me know.  *I used to wear almost exclusively J.Crew, but then they started doing things like  urlLink this .  Well, that, and I discovered the wonders of the Barney's Co-op and independent (and almost affordable) downtown designers.  Anyway, what are they smoking?    *Last night at  urlLink my daily dinner supplier , a middle-aged, well-dressed white woman asked, "What's the difference between a burrito and a tortilla?"  She looked perplexed when the cashier replied, "A burrito is IN a tortilla," and just ordered a burrito.  *Because I am not one to back down from a challenge, I have emailed a response to PEG.  Hopefully her reaction will not be blog-worthy.

           The Company Computer Nazis have really crossed the line this time.  I'm okay with not being able to use AIM.  Surely if I had access to this fine program I would have been fired long ago, and rightly so.  And I can kind of understand being blocked from web-based email.  Actually, no, that one really doesn't make sense, and I'll be damned if I'm going to alter my emailing habits in the off-chance my work account will be screened.  In any case, I can live without my hotmail during the day.  But what just happened to me is so unsettling I can barely type the words.  I have been blocked....from....a...............bl...blo........BLOG!    Seeking my daily dose of Olsen twin buzz, I just typed  urlLink www.whatevs.org  into my browser.  A white screen appeared that said the following:   The site you have requested (http://www.whatevs.org/) is unavailable as a non-business related site. Forbidden, this page (http://www.whatevs.org/) is categorized as: Chat.    I fear for the future.  The day the word "chat" is replaced with "blog" is the day I say sayonara to my dreams of a lifetime of corporate servitude.  Hmmm, come to think of it, perhaps this blog blockage is not such a bad omen after all.

       What I'm about to post probably crosses some kind of ethical boundary, but I'll change the names, and gosh darnit it's my bloggy and I'll post if I want to.  (Yes I just said that.)  So there's a big ol' college sporting event coming up, and seeing as how I was on said sport's college team for four years and want to support my former teammates, I thought it would be nice to round up the alumni troops to cheer on the kiddies.  I found an old mass email sent out by an alum three years my senior, who shall from here onward be referred to as Psychotic Evil Girl.  This was a sport-related blurb about upcoming events PEG had planned, none of which ever transpired, but that's beside the point.  What follows is a series of emails, beginning with mine--The Rudest, Most Offensive Email in the History of the Internet:     Hey there, alumni (alumnas?)-  I'm just sending out this little email to remind everyone that [event] is next weekend, specifically Sunday the 9th.  I know it would mean a lot to the [athletes] to have as many of us there as possible, and of course it would be awesome to see old friends and meet fellow survivors of the wrath/bad jokes of [our coach   -Gina ([College] '03) [oops, you already know where I went to college...so much for anonymity]   This was followed not five minutes later with two emails from PEG.  The first used the same list of addresses to plug the team she currently coaches:   Hi all,  You can also come and see my freshman [compete] at [event]. We have won all but one [event] this season, along with being the BIG EAST Champions.  Go [lesser school]!  Coach PEG   Then an email specially written for yours truly:   Gina,  I would appreciate it if you did not mass email my friends/alumni who dont know you. They are not happy about it. Below are the email addresses that you should take off your list. If you do have some important Alumni information, I can pass it along to them for you. Please respond to this email so I know that you received it.  Thanks,  PEG   I was quite surprised by this harsh, perplexing reaction, and I replied in an equally curt tone:   Ok.  [Coach] wanted me to encourage people to come, so I just replied to the old group email.  Sorry that an email from a fellow alum is so offensive to people.  Gina   This viscious attack turned PEG into a fire-breathing dragon, and she sent me the following and CC-ed some of her friends, a couple of whom are also my friends:   Well there is a long history of [College sport] prior to your experience that is very negative. Before the [Coach] "era". These alumni keep in touch with me because they are my friends, not because they have fond memories of their team. I have worked too hard to get them involved for you to piss them off.   You should respect that. If your email has even one bit of attitude. You know that I will not hesitate to tell you what I think, so I sure hope that you apologize to me.  Grow up.  [PEG's full name, which I have never heard anyone refer to her as]   At this point, I was stunned, stressed from both this and being robbed the day before (i.e., near tears,) and unsure how to proceed.  I forwarded the exchange to one of my best team friends who was very active on the team and knows both of us well.  Then, without being asked by me, Best Team Friend sent PEG an email defending my intentions, to which PEG responded pretty much as one could expect:   Hi BTF,   Thank you for the email. I wanted to let you know that I appreciate your thoughts. I trust what you have to say and will leave it at that.   About Gina's email...  Most people, including myself, respond well to emails that start with a "hi___," and end with a signature. If Gina really does regret offending alumni, I don't believe her email would be as short as it was. I do want to let you know that I did not CC you on my email, so I know that means Gina forwarded it to you. I am fine with that. I openly CC who I want and let people know it.   I only responded harshly to Gina's email because I felt it was rude. If she wants to help with Alumni relations, she has to start with expressing herself better over email. And she has to realize that no matter who her friends/teammates may be, she has to respect other alumni especially those who are older. There are 2 reasons why we dont support the team as much as we should. 1) bitter experiences that you guys will never understand and 2) for rude people like Gina, why should we help her out? we need to feel like we are giving back, not being treated like assholes.   Please do relay this message to her and let her know that again, it is childish not to deal with me and to have to cc you to talk to me. But, I prefer to deal with you anyway. I think the both of us can have a working relationship.   About alumni, I know that there are a lot of people interested in [competing] at the [non-college event]. let me know what your ideas may be.   Thanks again,   PEG   I am seriously at a loss.  This girl is crazy.  I've never been the chirpiest, friendliest person on the planet as I am on the shy side, but I am certainly not planning a team relations sabotage.  She's construed some kind of sinister motivation on my part, when my motivation was as simple as "alumni at event = good."  All I think I'm guilty of is being ignorant to all this manufactured drama.  Getting to PEG's finer points, I've re-read my initial email, and while it may be casual, I included a greeting and conclusion as PEG seems to have forgotten, and I don't see where the extreme rudeness comes in.  Also, PEG is hell-bent on calling me childish, yet she uses such tactics as CC-ing her friends and signing her full name.  I have not responded to her (how childish of me!) because a.) her attacks against me don't make sense, and b.) because at this point anything I say will most certainly be wildly misinterpreted and used against me.  And now that I know my apartment is so break-into-able, I really don't need any enemies.  Boy oh boy, I can't wait to see PEG this weekend!

       My cute Canadian e-mail buddy just sent me a link that is quite relevant to what all us post-college kiddies have been belly-aching about since, well, college.  According to the  urlLink Vice Guide to "Finding Yourself"  all I have left to do is backpack through Europe, do all sorts of drugs, dye my hair, and go to therapy and then my soul will be at ease.  A  urlLink FAB -style stay across the pond is in the works, but the drugs might have to wait as I already have more than my fair share of addictions.  And I do dye my hair and get therapy, though the former is in the form of golden blonde highlights from a schmancy salon, and the latter is free (you know who you are.)

       *Best part of a  urlLink VH1.com interview with Ambulance LTD  [via  urlLink Stereogum ] (whose album is lovely, by the way, though I must warn that my mom liked it too, but the lead singer is gorgeous...anyway):   VH1:  Is Avril setting a good example for girls?  Matt:  Yes. Why? I'll tell you. Because in that song she's kind of mad because her boyfriend thought she was gonna have sex with him. I think that's nice. Chastity is a good quality. I think it's good. Especially when you're Avril Lavigne and you're ... how old is she? Like 12 or something?  VH1:  She's 19.  Marcus:  She should give it up by now.   *While watching some  urlLink quality television programming  last night, I saw a commercial for Coors' new low-carb abomination  urlLink Aspen Edge .  I spent the entire commercial stewing over where for the love of God I'd heard the song before, then realized it's on my favorite lying in the hammock while smoking a cigarette and talking on the phone album,  urlLink My Morning Jacket 's  It Still Moves .  I've been intrigued by this good indie music as background phenomenon for years, of course on car commercials but especially on MTV.  The music for all the non-music shows is almost always whatever really good indie or electronic or underground hip hop is going on at the moment.  So somebody out there knows what the good stuff is, but for whatever reason the kids these days just aren't ready to hear  urlLink Spoon  without Nick and Jessica running around on the screen.  *Perplexa and I finally came up with a name for our band.  I can't share it with you because it's so hot someone would surely steal it, but I will say that it neither starts with "the" nor has ever been done before, guaranteed.  Now we just have to, like, learn how to play instruments other than the clarinet and the flute and we're in business.

       If I attempt to say anything remotely serious today I'm afraid I'll be shipped off to a padded room somewhere, so until my neurons calm the fuck down, you can read this gripping article about the  urlLink McDonald's Olympics  [via  urlLink where else ?]:    "Behold the perfection of an order of French fries served up by Luis Casanova.  The crispness, the hotness, the just-the-right-amount-of-salt-ness. And don't forget that smile when he serves up that tasty bag of McDonald's potatoes.  Casanova, 39, has worked hard to perfect his technique."  "Participants are paired up with a judge and scored on things like hand-washing and how long it takes to assemble an order."  I'm convinced that the Local Paper is secretly an Onionesque parody and somebody somewhere in Central Wis is laughing his or her ass off.  And, now that I've finally got a shiny little Mac that holds eighty bajillion songs, I can play the ITunes shuffle game, which turned out to be far less embarassing than it could have been (plus, the juxtaposition of the last two is just brilliant):  Television - Elevation			 The Cure - Boys Dont Cry						 Delays - Zero Zero One	 Kiss - Back In the New York Groove						 The Lemonheads - It's A Shame About Ray	 Black Sheep - This or That							 Monaco - What Do You Want From Me 						 The Smiths - Shoplifters of the World		 The Velvet Underground - Who Loves the Sun Bjork - Big Time Sensuality  Elvis Presley - Suspicious Minds Dido - Thank You REM - The Great Beyond			 Madonna - Ray Of Light		 Jagged Edge ft. Nelly - Where the Party At					 Cat Stevens - Father and Son

       Yesterday I walked home from work, as I tend to do when the weather is at least semi-nice and I want an excuse not to go to the gym.  I'm always in love with the city no matter what it does to me, but sometimes there are just these moments when things seem so perfect they could only happen here.  And it's usually when the everyday experiences become special, like my commute home last night.  *Just two blocks from my building I spied my old buddy  urlLink Jacob the Cute Rickshaw Driver .  Since he was on the job and couldn't stop for long, he offered me a ride to Central Park, as he was headed there anyway to pick up some tourists at the Plaza.  He pedaled, I sat, and we chatted about jobs, friends, plans, etc.  Except for the fact that you feel like you're going to fall forward into a sea of concrete and cars, this is not a bad way to travel.    *While walking up the Center Drive with my headphones on full blast I heard a car honk and a "Hey" and turned to see a large, nice-looking black man leaning toward the passenger-side window.   Man:  Where'd you get your  urlLink sneakers ?  I can't find them anywhere! Me:  Oh I'm sorry!  I got them in LA.  ["I got it in LA" is a phrase that would normally cause me pain, but, well,  urlLink I did get the limited edition Starsky and Hutch Adidas in LA ]  He smiled and drove off, and I put my headphones back on.  Then came another honk.  My new friend had a huge grin on his face and held up a black hightop Adidas sneaker.  I gave him a thumbs up and a "Niiiiice."  Big black man and little white girl bond over their sneakers--a little music in the background and this would've made a great commercial.  *Still laughing from that interaction, I approached the sand volleyball court where, apparently, the Gorgeous Shirtless Man Coalition was playing a match.  And we're not talking two or three cute guys here.  There were about twenty...all shirtless, all hot.  Note to self: take this route more frequently, and carry your camera at all times.  *Finally, at long long long last, it's Friday!!!!  Rock on.  Sleep.  Tell your psycho-conservative boss you're seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 this weekend and watch him explode.

       Since I'm such a fuckin' rockstar and went out two whole nights in a row and stayed up till *gasp* midnight on both of them, I'm too tired/uninspired to write anything of my own.  Please allow me to direct you elsewhere:  *I am in love, and his name is  urlLink Buddy .  The non-canine pics on this new site are great too, but seriously, what in the world is better than a little smiling mutt with crooked ears?  * urlLink Newyorkish  is back in business and has lots of fun time-killing links, but the  urlLink Skanky Bizarro Olsen Twins  take the cake.  *" urlLink While seated on the bench, an Oklahoma judge used a male enhancement pump, shaved and oiled his nether region, and pleasured himself, state officials charged yesterday in a petition to remove the jurist ."  [thanks, Ellen]  *I don't think I'll ever get over being amused by the dietary habits of my people.  My favorite quote from a  urlLink Local Paper front page news article  on the 30th Annual Polka Fest:  "On the menu are brats, chicken, roast beef, cheese curds and french fries. 'Plus we'll have plenty of beer and pop,' Perko said."   * urlLink Gag me with a spoon .

       As many of you may be aware, I like eating.  A singing fat lady will fly out of my ass before I ever utter the phrase, "Oh, I forgot to eat."  I just cannot relate to people who say such nonsense, as food is at the forefront of my consciousness pretty much all the time.  It gets me to work in the morning, keeps me company in my little multi-monitor pod, and when I'm running or biking or ellipticalling at the gym I'm also visualizing the burrito I'll be having immediately afterwards.  So, naturally, when something gets in the way of my carefully thought out eating plans I get a little *ahem* cranky.    Today I waited patiently all morning for the clock to strike 11:30, which I consider to be the earliest acceptable time to eat lunch.  I rarely hold out that long though, so my stomach was extra talkative.  Before I even returned to my pod with the precious food--I don't get one of those fancy hour-long break things I've heard talk about--Stereotypical Boss said, "You need to fill out a Patriot Act form for blah blah billion dollar account right away [and I don't have any information on the account whatsoever so you'll have to go downstairs to get the file which is thicker than Fatboss' thigh and page through all of it to find the necessary information and then collect some signatures and go back downstairs with the form filled out.]"  First, screw Dubya and that silly act.  Second, I think it is a testament to my maturity that I completed this task as my pesto pasta with tomato and giant mozzarella chunks called my name without crying or seriously injuring someone.  I'm going to have to conclude this one, as Fatboss is currently dancing to Big Important But Actually Very Tiny Chicago Boss's "In Da Club" ringtone and Mr. Fartypants at the end of the desk is working up a storm, so to speak. There has never been a better cue to leave for a little coffee/chocolate break.

       *Sorry, guys, but  urlLink Britney just ain't lookin' so hot .  I have to agree with Ellen though--ugly Britney is way more fun.  Now that she's got skin problems, noticeable body fat, and a penchant for booze and cigarettes, I can actually relate to the girl.  Go Britney.  *The  urlLink Television Without Pity Real World recaps  are always delightful if you follow the show.  This week's had me laughing out loud by repeatedly referring to Jacquese's parents as Macquese and Pacquese (just say it out loud.)  I also especially enjoyed the following paragraph, as I had the same feelings while watching the show:  "The roommates arrive at work. Robin interviews that they got there at 10:45, and that Troy wasn't very happy. Troy tells them that they were close to being on time, but that they were still late. Cameran asks sadly if they lost their bonus for the day. Troy says that it's 'like a normal job,' and that 'bonuses are for excelling, not just meeting.' So being late is meeting expectations? And being on time would be exceeding expectations? What the fuck? Where do I get one of these jobs?"

       I used to kill many an hour at work with  urlLink Craigslist , until, as you may recall, the Company Computer Nazis took it away from me.  This is probably for the best, as it's purely mindless entertainment--the internet equivalent of reality television.  I hadn't read the Missed Connections much at all lately, since it's just not as exciting when you have better things to do (i.e., just about anything.)  Last night, however, I found myself starting to watch the two most upsetting and unnecessary reality shows yet--The Ashlee Simpson Show and Who Wants to Marry My Dad Season 2--and Craigslist seemed like a bastion of intellectual stimulation.  And, lo and behold, what should I find?   Mercury Lounge on Saturday - Tall Blonde - m4w Date: 2004-06-21, 12:38PM EDT  We were there most of the night. Dirty on Purpose. Benzos. The Bravery.  You're tall, short blonde hair, had on a white t-shirt.  I'm 6'2", had on a short-sleeve blue shirt and jeans, reall short dark hair.  The girl I was with wasn't my girlfriend. But I don't usually pick up on women at clubs.  Wished I went up and talked to you.   I can't say I'm overly impressed with the fact that he didn't bother to talk to me in a BAR while I was very obviously drinking lots of BEER, but details schmetails--I got a Missed Connection!

       I don't know if it's the weather or what, but lately I haven't been feeling like going out much.  (Or else that's just what I'm telling myself to cover up the fact that I'm a lame-o.)  In any case, my weekend was relaxing and lovely.  *Friday. It was hectic for all in Manhattan Corporate Whoreland, probably because the bosses were off watching golf in the Hamptons.  You couldn't have paid me to go out to a bar or a party or a show, so Perplexa and I went to Ellen's for an evening which, aside from the three bottles of red wine we had no problem consuming, became a return to junior high sans acne and crippling insecurity.  Pizza, Ben & Jerry's, DeGrassi, My So-Called Life, Basketball Diaries, Ace of Base sing-a-long....yeah, as  urlLink VH1 knows , the 90's nostalgia is back.  Somebody please give me a good beating when I start wearing oversized flannel again.  *Saturday.  After a day of bonding with my futon, I decided to rejoin the living and went to Mercury Lounge with Perplexa.  Every single time we go out together--when it's just the two of us--we have strange interactions with strange men that end when one of us rescues the other from some ridiculous conversation.  Fortunately, Saturday's strange man required no conversation in exchange for drinks as he bought them anonymously through the bartender.  I didn't think that actually ever happened--he must watch a lot of movies.  Anyway, this freed us up to talk to the boys in the bands.  Speaking of which, if you like music that's pretty yet rockin' and a little shoegazey, I'd highly recommend  urlLink Dirty on Purpose .  If you like cute boys, I'd recommend  urlLink Benzos .  *Sunday.

       I know none of you need another bikini wax story.   urlLink It's been done .  But let me just add this:    Ladies, do not assume that your waxing technician speaks English just because she smiles and nods and says "okay" when you give her instructions.  If you're going Brazilian, I'd even suggest you bring along a Sharpie marker to outline restricted areas.  That is all.  Thank you.

       The goods have arrived.  Waiting outside my door when I got home yesterday was a big box, courtesy of Ebay and a nice old lady named Verna, who lives in Alberta.  (I feel a limerick coming on. Anyway.)  As my parents are too quick to point out, I am not at a loss for stuff, so lately I've been trying, with marginal success, to limit my purchases to things that are either essential (new computer,) so mindblowingly awesome I want to marry them (Levi's 1970 684 Big Bells replica,) or utterly ridiculous (Verna's goodies.)  The  urlLink gas pump shaped liquor dispenser  certainly falls into the last category, and I think this item is somewhere between the second and the third:        After removing the vintage "shirt" from it's protective Ziploc baggie, I admired it's shiny smoothness for a good ten minutes.  Then I went to the gym.

There's just something creepy about older women all tightened and tarted up and the way they end up looking almost exactly the same.  I think it's the super-slanty eyes and permanent Joker grins.

       Awwww sheeit, this is too funny.  And since it's all going down mere steps from my abode I feel obliged to do some crashing.  Via  urlLink Gawker :    "BREAKING! The Vogue vs. Teen Vogue soccer match has been postponed  'Due to impending inclement weather and pre-release tomorrow, the soccer match scheduled for tomorrow will instead be played: MONDAY, JUNE 21. Riverside Park and 70th St. 7 PM. VOGUE vs. TEEN VOGUE. Riverside.'  Oglers, latent pedophiles, and lovers of hilarity, please mark your calendars."  Incidentally, I'll be rooting for  urlLink Teen Vogue , the publication of which I get just a little too excited about each month.  Grownup Vogue went downhill ages ago, in my not so humble opinion, and after ignoring about 800 "very special deal if you renew NOW" cards, I have been freed from its grasp.

       *Aaaaaaah white trash drama.  This little  urlLink police blurb  courtesy of the esteemed  urlLink Local Paper  is special on oh so many levels (I've counted five):  Battery  A 30-year-old Marshfield woman reported an unknown woman in a bride's dress picked her up by her hair at 1:30 p.m. Sunday while she was dancing at Elixir Lounge and Nite Club, 434 S. Central Ave. After getting away from the bride, the 30-year-old woman said a man she identified as the groom pushed her down a flight of stairs inside the establishment.  *Also from the Local Paper is the  urlLink announcement  of the birth of little Kalob Mykal Yeager.  Something tells me this poor kid won't be winning spelling bees anytime soon...  *Like the Local Paper but for the opposite reason,  urlLink Pitchfork  is a news source that is frequently just too easy to make fun of.  However, despite the incomprehensibly haughty writing, it points me in the direction of good, new music, and sometimes it's so spot on I cry tears of joy.  If you've seen the latest Lenny Kravitz video, which "finds everyone's favorite half-Jew waking up with approximately 12 naked models, partying on a private jet, passing out backstage, waking up to shake around more frills than a Roger Daltrey montage, scratching his bidness on a piano, then running backstage again to stare introspectively and drunkly into a mirror," you'll know  urlLink what this guy's talking about  (scroll to bottom.)  *Last but not least, some news commentary via my friend E's boss' friend in Hong Kong:  "Factory workers mangled by machinery. Exploding gas wells poisoning villages. School-fireworks factories blowing up. The glorious motherland consolidates its global leadership in imaginative industrial safety mayhem, courtesy of the Great Garlic Disaster of 2004:  '30 in China Buried in Garlic Pile; 11 Die  BEIJING (AP) - Storage shelves stacked high with garlic collapsed in central China, burying 30 workers and killing 11 of them, state media reported Thursday.'   The accident Wednesday morning in Henan province prompted a large rescue operation to dig out workers weighed down by the massive pile of garlic shoots and broken shelving, the Beijing Times and other newspapers reported.  What a way to go.  The death toll from the Great Garlic Disaster of 2004 has risen  to 15. Clearly, we must treat this substance with more respect in future.  Many are the times I have crushed cloves of garlic totally oblivious to the possibility that they can do the same to me."

       Such a good weekend.  Oftentimes, days and days will go by in which nothing notable happens, and then people ask what I've been up to and all I have to talk about are burritos and reality television.  Well this weekend was the opposite of that--nothing mind-blowing or anything, just good times with good people.  Rather than blather on endlessly, I think I'll break this up into little episodes (who needs those pesky transition sentences anyway?) and throw in some purdy pictures.  * urlLink The Heights .  Ahhh The Heights.  This is one of the two college bars in which I spent way more time than class.  For happy hour on Friday, I met up with L, who is getting up at 4:30 a.m. six days per week this summer to row, and another  urlLink L , who just returned from far off lands.  The man who mixed me countless Long Island Iced Teas freshman year is still bartending so I felt at home, and thanks to a couple of his margaritas I was wasted by 8 p.m.  After a regrettable drunken email or two and a bag of tortilla chips with salsa and cream cheese (it seemed like a good idea at the time) I had to call it a night.  this girl has the best laugh in the world    * urlLink Laicale .  It took me five years to do so, but I've finally found my hair place.   urlLink Bumble  schmumble, Laicale is so much more sane and favorably located.  I also have a weird fascination with my stylist, Brian.  I'd never had a guy cut my hair before, but the first time I went there he was wearing the coolest boots ever and I had to have him next.  We've hardly spoken because I'm all shy and awkward sometimes and he's all sweet and quiet (also, it just seems weird to chat it up with someone who's got a sharp object near your head,) but I know we could be buddies if we, like, talked or something.  thanks, laicale brian    *Afternoon with  urlLink Drone .  Great minds do, indeed, think alike.  With no prior consultation, Drone and I booked appointments at Laicale for the same day, around the same time.  We walked around Soho in between appointments and the East Village afterwards.  The weather Saturday was simply perfect, and illegal to go margaritas combined with the  urlLink informal dog show  in the park made the day even more perfect.  Except for one minor detail...  isn't she lovely?    *El accidente.  After the dog show, I was hungry as usual, so Drone and I went to  urlLink Esperanto  for a cuban sandwich and more margaritas.  While getting up to use the facilities, I sprained my ankle  urlLink Susie -style (i.e., tripping over nothing while attempting to walk under the influence of not that much alcohol.)  It's not as severe as her sprain was, but I have a sexy limp thing going on.  I'm usually quite resposible when it comes to my health, but sometimes I'm like the Black Knight from  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail , who, in case you don't recall, shrieked "it's only a flesh wound!" as his limbs were being lopped off.  As such, I treated the injured ankle by dancing on it for five hours straight...  dancin' fools    * urlLink Misshapes .  Like the last time I went to this party, 5 a.m. came upon me with no warning.  The night was full of  urlLink friends making out , friends doing things even I am too prude for, friends running into long-lost friends, and a sleazy Spaniard whose hands kept finding their way up my skirt until said friends thankfully intervened (see if you can find him in the photo below.)  Also, I could not hold onto anything.  I remember sending four vodka tonics flying, which means there were probably more than that, and I dropped my 5 a.m. hot dog on myself and woke up Sunday morning smelling like a vodka, mustard, and sauerkraut cocktail.  Yum.  where's waldo?    *Hungover afternoon with Drone.  Miraculously and after much prodding, I managed to drag myself outside on Sunday for a stroll through the West Village.  I'm so glad I did, because not only did we witness a hilarious interaction between a group of homeless men and unfortunately-dressed tourists, but I had one of my best celebrity sitings to date.  Walking near the Marc Jacobs store with a nondescript B-list actor boy in tow was none other than  urlLink Nicky Hilton .  I gawked for a little too long as she walked past me (had to get a good look) and she glared.  She had stringy, jet black hair that was all matted in the back and absurdly tan skin, and, of course, she was way shorter than she looks on TV.  not nicky hilton

       It has been almost exactly a year since I began my employment at JP Morgan Stanley Goldman Stearns Lynch Brothers.  Weird.  The sizable bi-monthly checks and complete lack of any responsibilities save for sitting relatively still in front of a computer for 9.25 hours a day have made it one of the easiest.  The complete lack of goals or purpose or meaning or convictions (is this steak vegetarian?) or anything at all for my poor young soul to cling to have made it one of the hardest.  It may seem as though I haven't really done much of anything, but, as a matter of fact, I've learned quite a few important things.  Now maybe THIS year I'll be ready to, like, get a legitimate hobby. Maybe even one that doesn't involve drinking, blogging, and making out.  Anyway, behold my newfound wisdom:  *No matter how many baby strollers patrol the sidewalks near your apartment, do not fail to lock the door to your terrace, especially when the window leading from your apartment to the terrace has been left wide open.  My replacement computer and undies are super cute, but the old ones did just fine, thanks.  *If for four years you worked out twice a day, five or six days a week, and then you become almost completely sedentary, you cannot maintain the same caloric intake and be utterly shocked when you go up a pants size or two and finally start filling out your bras.    *Tanning beds feel good and they make you look better.  If you are fair-skinned and have not been going to nude beaches since childhood, do not use them without wearing undergarments.  There are some things that have never seen the sun, and when subjected to direct ultra-violet rays they will get angry and make you think you have all kinds of crazy diseases.  [these last two bear no mention of underwear of any sort--sorry]  *Los Angeles is not the hell hole New Yorkers make it out to be, and I’ll freely admit that I do not hate it.  In fact, I kinda like it.  A lot.  But not as much as New York. Please.  *I’m still a retard when it comes to the boys.  Relashawhat?      For some reason, this picture really resonated with me today.

       Once upon a time, I filled out an online survey in the hopes of earning myself a free Guinness towel.  Yesterday all my dreams came true, and I am now the prowd owner of an approximately 8 by 12 inch piece of cloth.  You too can  urlLink fill out the survey , which requires you to estimate the number of drinks you have per month (quite a sobering task,) and get yourself a free Guinness magnet.

       Yesterday at about 4:55 i had a little come-to-Jesus talk with my boss.  (I don't know if "come-to-Jesus" is an established phrase or if my friend Raegan just made it up, but she uses it all the time and now I do too because I like it, along with most transgressions of the Second Commandment.  Anyway.)  I had a minor heart attack when he summoned me over to his three square feet of desk space and said "well you've been here a year now..." but chilled when it was apparent I still had a job and that he really wants to help me do well.  Essentially, he recognizes that I'm not always gung-ho about work, and now that it's been a year and I know how to take care of all the mundane secretarial type crap, it's time to "learn the business."  And how do I do this?  Brown-nose more.  That's it, really, and in his words.  Like the other youngun on my desk, I should stand up and ask Ol' Sport inane questions until there's bullshit coming out my ears.  This fake, schmoozy behavior pretty much represents the polar opposite of my personality, so I've got quite the challenge.  Honestly, I'm doubtful that I can hack it, (and if I can't Boss will help me find something else to do, which is fuckin awesome and generous of him,) but what can you do in such a situation besides give it the college try.  My transformation commenced with the one thing I do know how to do:  buy clothes.  I even braved the royal bitches at the  urlLink Theory store  on Columbus Ave.  Now that's dedication.

       Where else can you find--and decide that you NEED to own--something like this?      For the record, it's a liquor dispenser in the form of a 1920's gas pump.  You make drinks (or drink directly) from the gas nozzle.  It also lights up.

       *I just accidentally found the Friendster profile of the serious girlfriend of one of my all-time favorite Boysivesleptwith.  She looks nice and cool.  Good for them.  After a cig to recover from the little punch in the tummy, I returned to find this email from E: "well, you're hotter but she's jewish.  what can you do."  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what friends are for.  *Fatboss is currently purchasing a "Peace Through Superior Firepower" T-Shirt from  urlLink this website , purveyor of "pro-gun and pro-liberty products for fellow gun-owners and conservatives!" He offered to buy me one, but I had to decline.  *Speaking of shirts, I am about to break into virgin fashion territory.  The most risque I get is a cute tube top with a pair of jeans and big ol' boots.  But something is compelling me to buy  urlLink this shirt  (if you can even call it that) which I've found elsewhere in a demure silver color for only $20.  I will, however, only wear it out late at night with a pair of jeans and big ol' boots.

       I didn't do much this weekend of note other than eat lots of yummy things ( urlLink Max  and Haagen Dazs and Bacos...oh my) and watch some good movies (Kill Bill, What About Bob, Saved.)  However, I've recovered from last week's mystery disease and plan to spend less time bonding with my futon this week.  Until I have something vaguely interesting to say, behold:  * urlLink The Hallelujah Diet .  Like rock music and brightly colored  urlLink woven lanyards  (??), the Christians once again demonstrate their hipness to the country's trends.   *I doubt Jesus ate much cheese, but oh my gosh the Marshfieldians do.  This past weekend was  urlLink Dairyfest , which is by far the biggest event of the year. The whole town becomes consumed with dairy fever.  My sis, who is living at home for a bit--bless her heart--went to the roller rink where there were people designated to skate around and hand out free cheese.  Wisconsin is the second fattest state in the country and darn proud of it!  *Speaking of fat,  urlLink here  is an amazing scientific discovery courtesy of the news pioneers at msn.com.  I made this discovery all by myself last summer, and now, with the problem semi-rectified, all my expensive work pants are too big.  [via My Friend Ellen]  * urlLink Vintage Cool Things .  This post has inadvertently become all about food (as they all should be, really), but I have to mention this website I just found, which I could call yummy if I wanted to be annoying.  The site offers high quality vintage goods (including stuff for boys!) at very affordable prices, most notably, some gorgeous shoes that my clodhoppers don't have a prayer of fitting in.  I did, however, slamdunk that whole  urlLink multistrand necklace  trend for a mere $30.  *Last but not least, thanks to Ronald (not MacDonald,) I may have half of Thursday and all of Friday off work (almost like last week!)  At least that's the word on the street.  Hahaha, get it, STREET?

       *The Spelling Bee yesterday was excellent.  Perplexa called during the last round, and I couldn't stop talking about the "extreme spelling" (they actually said that) and cheered when my favorite kid won.  I think she thought I was insane, but she already knew I'm a big nerd--high school math team, anyone?  Anyway, nerd or not, you'll probably enjoy this  urlLink video of the 1997 Bee Champion , who is supposedly the basis for Molly Shannon's Mary Katherine Gallagher character on SNL.  * urlLink THANK GOD . [via  urlLink Stereogum ]  *I'm so lightheaded right now that I think I'm going to pass out like one of the kids in the Spelling Bee yesterday and I'm kind of crying so I think it's time to go home (in an expensed Towncar...mmm.)  Have a lovely weekend.

       First, a big fat congratulations to my main man Drone for rocking his big important interview.  He certainly deserves a good break after putting up with Robo for so long.    So I had my licensing exam this morning.  Apparently, my test-preparation method of not reading the study materials, a couple days of excessive drinking, a couple nights of not sleeping, and going to a rock show last night was adequate to pass the exam.  It has, however, left me with a nasty cold/flu type illness.  When I called the bosses to report the news, Stereotypicalboss answered and was delighted because, as banker types do, he and Fatboss made a bet on the exam outcome and now Fatboss owes him lunch.  Nice to have their full support.  But STBoss let me have the day off, so now I'm chugging diet ginger ale and watching the 2004 National Spelling Bee LIVE! on ESPN.  Aside from the whole wanting to dissociate from my body thing, I really couldn't be happier.

       Lately, Tuesdays have been my favorite TV-watching days as they're loaded with gems like Next Top Model, Showbiz Moms and Dads, American Idol, Queer Eye, and the Real World.  Since most of the aforementioned shows have recently left us, I was worried that spending yesterday evening hungover on the couch would be sadly unfulfilling. But oh was I ever wrong. I'm not usually the laugh out loud at the TV type, but one very special program had me in constant tears of joy.  urlLink Miss Universe Pageant , I salute you.  The highlights:  *The glitch in the opening scene that caused the introductions for Miss Geor-gee-yaaaaah and Miss Germany to repeat no less than eight times.    *Hoping that cohost  urlLink Billy Bush  was related to George W, thinking that it was too good to be true but that they do look eerily similar in that chimpanzee kinda way, and finding out via Google that he is indeed Dubya's nephew.  *The litany of esteemed judges, including the two Apprentice finalists, "supermodels" who are not in fact supermodels, and the World Speedwalking Champion.  Of course.  *The lone circus performer doing tricks on a rope BEHIND the audience during the evening gown montage.  Wha??  *Gloria Estefan's first performance, in which her microphone was not working properly and all you could hear were the band and the pre-recorded vocals.  *Gloria Estefan's second performance, in which one of her large, gold earrings fell out and she tried unsuccessfully to turn her head to the side so that no one would notice, and then gave up and pretended that she did not look absolutely ridiculous.  (Note: it appeared that ol' Gloria may have been on a large dose of narcotic painkillers, so it's quite possible that she really did not notice.)  *Being told by Miss Universe 2003 that MY dream in life is to be Miss Universe.  If you too are a girl, don't hesitate to  urlLink enter next year's competition , as this is apparently your dream as well.

       It's Friday and my brain is fried and totally in the gutter.  Via  urlLink JC Report , a weekly email newsletter on "global fashion trends," comes articles on Chinese luxury goods, the designer hotel boom, Azzedine Alaia shoes, and  urlLink The Bulge (TM).  This latter item is a "very realistic looking, flexible insert [that] sits snugly atop your natural assets and provides significant increase to your manhood."  Ummm.  Errrr...I mean...uhhh.  Ahem.  Ok, that rotating picture is strangely captivating.  But anyway, like excessively padded bras, this device poses a dilemma.  If the purpose of it is to attract members of the sex to which you are attracted, once you've succeeded wouldn't the poor sucker be a little disappointed?  In other news, I just rediscovered this  urlLink British online shoe store .  With a selection more impressive in size than even The Bulge(TM), reasonable prices, and cool stuff for dudes too (Ten-year-old Boy is my preferred style of dress,) I'm tempted to stop resisting and just get a shoe fetish already.

       The one thing I regret not doing in college is a study abroad program.  I was too busy injuring muscles I didn't know existed.  My little sis, however, is taking the opportunity to immerse herself in the words and ways of a foreign culture by spending six months in Santiago, Chile.  Just days into her trip, she is having new and exciting experiences.  Behold the email I received from her just this very morning:   Hey, just wanted to let you know that last night I experienced what I may have to label the most awkward moment of my life--and there have been many candidates for this honor. I don´t know if I mentioned that my host sister, Monica (aka Kiki) got a boob job yesterday. This seemed weird in itself because I would love to be so small and pretty and cute and I don´t think her looks need to be improved in the slightest, but I guess she always dreamed of being more chesty so whatever.  Anyway, she came home around nine last night and I was told to go up and visit. So I did, and she was very tired and in a lot of pain but apparently quite happy. So I asked her if it hurt a lot and such and then couldn´t think of anything more to say, so I stood around until my host mother, Monica the Elder, exiled me and Pablo the bf from the room so she could change her newly enhanced daughter´s clothes. I hung out in the hall trying to decide if I should go downstairs until finally M the E came out and invited us to re-enter the invalid´s room. Kiki was lying in bed with her eyes shut, smiling beatifically, and Pablo got onto the bed with her and my host mother cleaned off a chair and told me to sit down. So I sat there, staring at Kiki and trying to decide if I should say something. I could almost feel Pablo wondering why the hell I didn´t leave, and I was certainly wondering the same thing myself but I couldn´t figure out how to gracefully make my exit. Finally Kiki´s older brother Cristian walked in, and when he left I hopped up and followed him.  Honestly, I never thought I´d find myself hanging out in a room with somebody recovering from a boob job and said somebody´s scary boyfriend. Incidentally, Kiki doesn´t look all that different. Maybe it takes a couple days to reach full effectiveness. Or maybe you have to add water or something.   Thanks, kiddo.  You just keep on learnin'...

       I want one of  urlLink these .  I do not want one of  urlLink these .  I feel like a two-year-old.  A two-year-old who can drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and consume five-pound burritos.     Actually, I think I had more drive as a two-year-old (no pun intended.)  According to my parents, this picture was not staged as I was determined to drive the car.  In grade school, I took summer school classes for fun.  In high school, I took more Advanced Placement tests than anyone else in the entire fucking state.  In college, I woke up at 6:00 am, six days a week, nine months a year to haul a 200 pound boat around the Harlem River.  All because I just felt like it.  Now, I continuously dent my futon watching television shows with titles such as  urlLink Trading Spouses: Meet Your New Mommy.     Alas, I am no longer a two-year-old.  It's time to stop the whinin' and do something (really, anything will suffice) with my ooooh so tragic life before I annoy the crap out of myself.  I simply need to find a healthy balance between the masochism of my past and the hedonism of my present.  Now that I've fully experienced both, how hard can it be?

       Ahhh New York...so much to do!  But this was one of those weekends in which I didn't want to do any of it, and it was fantastic.  On Friday I was planning on having a roof party, but the weather gods weren't havin' it.  Plus, as you may have noticed, I wasn't really in the mood.  So I went out with a few good friends and drank lots of Brooklyn Lager.  In the timeless words of the Cars, it was just what I needed.       On Saturday I stayed in bed until sometime in the late afternoon and had a chat with Cute Canadian Internet Boyfriend Whom I Met In Real Life First Thank You Very Much.  After discussing the nerd factor of our fling (seriously, what’s the point of a fling if you can’t make out with the person?  yet I’m so drawn to that little MSN bubble man,) I left CCIBWIMIRLFTYVM for a dinner of Ethiopian delights with Perplexa.  Why mushy vegetables eaten with bread that’s spongier than that lo-carb crap is so transcendently good is beyond me.  It’s definitely worth that special feeling you get in your stomach afterwards, which we nursed by reading Us magazine (Justin is soo not cheating on Cameron, I’m serious guys) and watching a National Geographic special entitled “Girl Power” which featured promiscuous female macaques, bisexual bonobos, and spontaneously sex-changing fish.  Then I continued to rot my brain whilst Perplexa went off to some  urlLink torturous sounding seven hour production  at Lincoln Center armed with a little treat from my medicine cabinet.  Sunday was all about napping and laundry and television so I won't bore you with the details, but I must just say that I want to marry  urlLink Sacha Cohen .

       [Memo to the City of New York:  It's neato that Midtown is all shiny and clean and ready to host hoardes of fannypack-wearing/overly-but-strangely dressed tourists.  All those smooth, marbled sidewalks look purty and all, but they are so damn slippery when wet--especially for those wearing flipflops or similarly-soled footwear.  I am now suffering back pain from tensing up during the fifteen or so times I nearly fell while walking five blocks to the subway.  I'll take the old school gritty concrete, thank you very much.]  Today is dark and rainy and all around disgusting.  Oh yeah, and it's my birthday.  Happy birthday to me.  But not only is it my birthday, it is my GOLDEN birthday.  For those who did not consider this a momentous occasion as a child like I did, this means I am turning TWENTY-THREE on the TWENTY THIRD.  I've been in one of my mini-depressions since last night but am slowly snapping out of it, thanks to some kind words from friends and...the package of cookies from my mom that the UPS man just brought to my door during that ellipsis.  In what I just know was a tribute to me, today good ol' Pitchfork  urlLink posted some lyrics  from a lovely My Morning Jacket song that is coincidentally entitled "Golden."  Like my mood, it is melancholy and kind of sad but not hopeless.  If I were more skilled I'd post the mp3, but I am not so I will be a chopped nut covered cheeseball and post the lyrics.   Watchin' a stretch of road,  Miles of light explode  Driftin' off a thing  I'd never done before  Watchin' a crowd roll in  Out go the lights it begins  A feelin' in my bones  I never felt before...   Mmm...people always told me  That bars are dark and lonely  And talk is often cheap  And filled with air  Sure, sometimes they thrill me  But nothin' could ever chill me  Like the way they make  The time just disappear   Feelin' you are here again  Hot on my skin again  Feelin' good's a thing  I'd never known before  What does it mean to feel  Millions of dreams come real  A feelin' in my soul  I'd never felt before  And you always told me  No matter how long it holds me  If it falls apart  Or makes us millonaires  You'll be right here forever  We'll go thru this thing together  And on heaven's golden shore  We'll lay our heads

       Project Don't Get Deported to Wisco began officially today with a trip to an NYC staffing agency.  I was a little concerned about going in for an interview and computer testing given that I slept all of five minutes last night.  (Note to self and others:  Do not spray half the contents of a can of Raid inside a 144 square foot space.  Carcinogenic fumes are not, in fact, preferable to one measly cockroach.)  However, the woman I met with (who assisted Drone in his "industry change" as well) was very friendly, gave me resume-spiffing suggestions, and said I "presented well," dark undereye circles and all.  Next was the testing.  Three 30-minute exams on Word, Excel, and Powerpoint followed by a typing exam.  These basically confirmed what I've known all along--I should be a professional test-taker, if only such a thing existed.  Eighty-one words per minute, baby, with zero errors.  Boo.  Yah.    So then I get on the elevator all pumped from my proven (but feigned) computer expertise.  A man, presumably from the agency, noticed that I was carrying a score report.  "Don't worry," he said, "people who do really well on tests suck at actual jobs."    Fucker.

       I don't really feel like writing cover letters at the moment, so I'll tell you about the crazy ass dream I had this morning in between smacking the alarm clock and finally waking up five minutes after I usually get on the subway.  Also, thanks to Drone for his little update, as I know he is a very busy bee over at Better Than That Other Guy Who Has a Similar Business Headquarters.  Pure Protein goodness is forthcoming.    As Joni Mitchell (or was it Carly Simon? are they really different people?) so astutely pointed out, you don't know what you've got till it's gone.  I've learned that this is especially true of regular sex (well, to be honest, I've been learning this one the hard way for the last three years,) the ability to use hands painlessly for things such as grasping a pen and washing one's hair (despite its snooty reputation, rowing is quite a savage, bloody sport,) and sleep, including all the good things that come with it, like white eyeballs and coherent thoughts (I am no stranger to sleep deprivation, the degree of which, apparently, is highly correlated with my parenthesis and comma usage.) An insomniac extraordinaire, I rarely enter into the REM stage, much less remember the dreams I have when I happen to get there.  This morning, however, I had quite an excitingly strange dream that I only remembered once E mentioned her dream about copulating with Lance Armstrong in a grocery store parking lot.    Basically, the dream got good and memorable when I received an assignment from an unidentified old man to go to outer space.  With the assistance of an unidentified older woman and my little sister, I was to fly to Venus in a little red two-door sedan (not a Corvette, sadly) and secretly plant a computer chip inside of a yellow sportscar that was parked there.   If my unconscious experiences are any indication, flying into space in a small gas-powered vehicle is at first terrifying and then fun once you realize you aren't going to die.  So we arrived on Venus after bypassing the sun (naturally,) and I put the very important computer chip in the car.  It started emitting a pulsing light and we were detained by some celebrity who I think was Star Jones.  Turns out, Venus is home to hoards of B-list celebrities who are fed up with earthly craziness.  Jared Leto was there too.   According to a handy online dream dictionary, "Celebrity dreams show the strong urge to find a place within a group that is emotionally secure and creatively satisfying."  Furthermore, "Seeing Venus in your dream, [sic] symbolizes love, desire, fertility, beauty, and femininity."  Yes, Online Dream Dictionary, I do desire emotional security, creative satisfaction, and, um, desire.  As does everyone else in the freakin' universe.  I blame my haywire brain on the single most disturbing 30 minutes of television I have ever experienced--last night's episode of Six Feet Under.

       For some reason I have not been able to go to bed at a reasonable hour since getting back to New York.  I don't know if it's excitement about new boys (who, refreshingly, are my age, unaware of the blogosphere, and willing to admit an unironic love of cheesy music) a plethora of upcoming social events (most of which I'll probably be too lazy to attend but, hey, it's nice to have options,) or finding a new job (yeah, um, i'll get on that right after lunch...)  Or maybe it's just because I'm smoking too much, not exercising, and dozing off after work.  In any case, I think my point is that I'm tired and you should amuse yourself with things other than my blathering:  * urlLink BLT candles .

But now that I will no longer be overpaid for being underworked, I think I might just start buying stuff from them again.  It's like Urban Outfitters, only priced more appropriately for the quality (or lack thereof) of the goods.  *See if you can tell the difference between  urlLink these two photos .

       During my senior year of high school, there was a big time controversy going on in lil' old Marshfield.  There had always been a big statue of Jesus in this public park on the highway on one end of town, but one day a man reported this breach of the Constitution to the Freedom from Religion Foundation and all hell broke loose, so to speak.  The man's name was Clarence Reindeers.  Clarence Reindeers' argument--that seeing the religious imagery made him physically ill--didn't hold much water, sadly, as he lived across the street from Saint Joseph Hospital and cemetery.  So the city did what any law abiding entity would do and sold the patch of land on which Jesus stands to a private party, put state and national flags next to it, and painted it bright colors.     Meanwhile, on the other end of town, another Jesus watches over something very special.     Here are some other pics from my impromptu vacay that having nothing to do with Jesus:  At least Daisy the Dog thinks Mom's hemp clothing is hot     In Madison we sat by the lake and watched kids race canoes.  All three canoes sunk and it was really funny.     My baby, Babe     Daisy, who was six months old when we got her because nobody wanted to take the puppy with the underbite.

       Sorry if I've scared anyone with the moroseness in some of the latest posts.  While I may only be able to chew with one side of my mouth until at least Wednesday, I am, in fact, quite relieved and happy now.  The prospect of just going to a different place every day, and perhaps (oh please, God) having a job that commences later than 7:45 a.m. is quite exciting.  (And a cute boy is taking me to dinner tonight.  I didn't think people did that anymore.  Hope the food is soft...)

       I have safely returned from the land of unironic trucker hats.  For the first time in the eleven years that I've been coming to New York, seeing the skyline from the plane made me neither warm nor fuzzy.  I took one look at it, snarled, and turned my attention to the Queens side.  There are lots of houses with those round backyard swimming pools there.    As anticipated, getting to work this morning was a task completed only with constant pacifying, in the form of a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to get out the door and to Starbucks, and iced grande soy latte (grande soy iced latte?) on the train, and a cigarette from the train station to the building.  I thought I'd be sitting around all morning terrified, but around 10:00 I heard the magic words:  "Gina, follow me to the back."  Except for the nasty HR lady who said that if I were her daughter she would have smacked me silly for running off like I did (I'm no parenting expert, but I doubt that technique would work very well on lost/confused 22-year-olds...bitch) the conversation went very well.  Mainboss is simply a wonderful human being, and he was very understanding and sympathetic to my unhappy state and the fact that I am not the kind of person who does well here.  I decided against continuing to work on a scary warning/probationary status, and now I have two weeks to find someone who wants to pay me. And to go to the dentist, finally, before I lose my health insurance.    I'm daunted by this task given my pathetic lack of job-hunting and interviewing experience, but right now I feel so much lighter, and not just because I've lost about five pounds on the Mom's Wholesome Cooking/Scared Shitless About How To Make Money and What To Do With My Life Diet.  Hmmm, perhaps I could devote my life to eradicating that Atkins nonsense...

       I was going to post some self-indulgent drivel about how utterly hopeless I think my life may be, but I kind of got it out of my system while out mowing the lawn and getting mauled by mosquitos on every non-DEET-slathered patch of skin.  Plus, no one needs another  urlLink Gloomy Gus .    *The first sentence says it all.  " urlLink The beer gods were looking after Patrick Troyer on Wednesday when three kegs of Wisconsin Amber lager crossed Troyer's path on his way to work ."   *Reason #2938470239 why I love my sister.  While out walking the dogs today, she told me a story:  "Earlier when I was walking to my haircut, I passed by a big old guy with three girls, and they were all carrying stacks of paper.  They handed me a piece and said they were opening a new Baptist church and that I should come check it out.  I didn't know what to do with the flyer, and there were no garbage cans around.  I was passing by the Presbyterian church, and I hung it on their door."  [I am now in possession of said flyer, as it was hanging on the Via Family door as well.  Just to warn you heathens out there, if you do not know for sure that you are going to Heaven, then there is a good chance that your eternal home will not be Heaven.]  *Oh goody,  urlLink an inane patriotic poem .  This must get an entire page in the newspaper!:  "Jim Schecklman woke early one morning with words flowing through his mind.  Within about 20 minutes, Schecklman composed,  I, American , a poem to honor the troops deployed around the world."  [I wonder if he was inspired by the upcoming Will Smith blockbuster,  I, Robot ...]  *You know those heinous scrunchies with fake hair on them?       People wear those here.  Alrightie, time to go shower.  My DEET grease-perfume is making me a little woozy.  Guess I'll post again on Monday.  If my parents manage to drag me kicking and screaming onto the plane, that is.

       Today I took a little roadtrip to Madison with Katie, the best friend from high school.  We sat outside by the lake and ate (well I did at least) an absurd amount of  urlLink ice cream  with our friend Dustin, whom I hadn't seen since the 90's.  He is about to head off to Berkeley to get a Ph.D. in chemical engineering.  Hot damn.  Dustin's that winning combo of extremely smart, extremely hard-working, and extremely down to earth, and I'm so happy for him.  It feels good to know that some people have their shit together, even as I'm still contemplating picking up shit for a living.  This brings me to what I've been thinking about in the car all day, which is how to make enough money to stay in New York.  Wisconsin's Best Small City! will always be here, so I might as well give it the college try.  Here's the list of ideas so far.  Further suggestions are more than welcome, but keep in mind that my goal at this point is simply to have an occupation which does not make my brain drip out of my ears.  *Temping.  I'm not a big fan of office jobs, but at least the office would be constantly changing.  Plus, it pays well enough, and I can type and do mindless, repetitive tasks better than the average monkey.  *Dog-walking/Rickshaw-driving.  These go in the same category because they're both the same kind of subservient.  Bonus points for the inherent exercise, as I'm sure as hell not going to be able to afford my gym membership.  *Selling my body.  No, not like that.  There's a lot of research going on in ol' New York, and subjects are always needed.  I once got 60 bucks to lie in an MRI thingy for 20 minutes.  Also, I saw cold hard proof that I have no major brain deformitites!  Only problem with this is that the big bucks go to the druggies, and I've yet to acquire a coke habit.  Darn.  *An obvious choice to make some decent interim money is the food service industry.  Fancy restaurants are out.  Been there, done that.  I am not hostess/waitress material.  I worked in a little coffee shop once and liked it, but the pay is not so good.  Then there's bartending, which I think I could do, but I have no experience and stupidly neglected to take the  urlLink Columbia University Bartending Course  when it was so convenient.    *Tutoring.  Small children scare me, so babysitting is not an option, but I have a small, exaggeratable amount of tutoring experience.  I was good at school, and my love for multiple choice tests is a little beyond normal, the evidence of which I will shamelessly waive in the face of anyone considering hiring me.  Problem with this is finding work independent of an agency.  There is no room to share the wealth right now.  Okay, that's about all I've considered much as far as temporary work goes.  Oh, I also like to paint--walls, not canvases.  Hmm.  Anyway, it would be neato to have a real job, or go to graduate school, but if I'm going to spend any more large blocks of time somewhere I'd want it to be leading to something.  And I HAVE NO STINKIN' CLUE what that something could be.

       I could go on and on about how my life's been turned upside down (cue early 90's rap beat--nooow this is a story aaall about how...nevermind,) but I don't have any energy left for pessimism.  Here are the things about yesterday that were awesome:  *Lunch with my best friend from high school at Applebee's.  We both ordered wraps off the "Weight Watchers" section of the menu.  Then we devoured a gigantic hunk of apple pie smothered in ice cream and caramel sauce.  *Finding a cute, bar-worthy shirt at Target for $2.24.  Good to know that I can still shop when I'm sans income.   urlLink Elisabeth Hasselbeck  ain't got nuthin' on me.  *Taking Mickey the Horse out for a spin after picking up my sister from her riding lesson.  Like any sport, watching people who know what they're doing makes it look so easy.  However, riding requires just as much precision as, say, rowing or perhaps even more since your vehicle is an independently mobile animal.  (Though for those who've rowed on the Harlem River, I think it's an even comparison.)  *Mom's foccaccia pizza.  It's so simple--pizza crust, sliced potatoes, crispy onions--but for some reason it's one of my favorite meals ever.  Carbalicious!  *A fireside chat with Dad about life 'n stuff.  Though I should mention that while it was indeed near the fireplace, there was no fire, and we realized that the same two birch logs have been in that thing since we moved in 16 years ago.  *Falling asleep with my Babe curled up behind my knees.

       So bossman is not happy.  In fact, he is quite pissed.  As he should be, because I seriously fucked up.  It's not that I think that I should know what I want to do with my life at this early stage, but it doesn't make having no goals and purpose whatsoever any easier.  I'll be back in NYC next week, and let's just say there's a good chance I'll be back in good ol' Marshfield not long after that.

       Whew, that was a close one.  I knew I was a goner after I got in the family minivan, had trouble adjusting the steering wheel, and required tremendous restraint not to chew off parental heads because of their retardeduselesspieceofcrapsteeringwheel!!!  That drama was soon under control, and while rocking out to Matchbox Twenty and assorted Top 40 Hits on the way to the Wal-Mart Supercenter, the only thought in my head was of how nice that first drag would feel.  Then I almost hit another minivan, and the admonishing honk snapped me out of my daydream. But just for a moment.  I was forced to explore the Wal-Mart while waiting for a prescription to be filled.  (Just 15 minutes!  Take that, Duane Reade!)  Man that place is enormous.  There were more mullets and cameltoes than I'd care to mention to distract me from my nicotine fantasies, but I was still sure I'd be buying a $3.20 pack of Marlboro Lights in a few minutes.  On the way back to the pharmacy, I noticed a lack of cigarettes at the checkout counters.  Guess I'd have to drive up the road to Weiler's Convenience Store.  Then I paid for the prescription (just some zit creme, no worries,) which cost the exact amount of cash I had in my wallet.  Now came the big decision.  Pay with credit card to save the cash for the Marlboros, or pay with cash and feel special for having the best willpower in the world?  Since I've been reading Lolita all day, I asked myself, What would Humbert Humbert do?  I don't think it's the best idea to adopt the thought processes of an insane murderous pedophile, but, nevertheless, I took the routine coincidence as a sign of something greater and emptied my wallet.  Then I drove home about 20 mph over the speed limit and made a beeline for one of Dad's local microbrewery beers.  It is delicious and refreshing, but it would be even nicer with a cig.

       All of a sudden I'm out in Dairyland at a rehab center in the form of my parents' 1960's three-bedroom ranch-style house.  I woke up in NYC Saturday morning feeling like utter crap after yet another night of having a little too much fun for my own good.  I started to think about all the people who were away for the holiday weekend with their families and friends.   Rather than planning some elaborate vacation as I'd previously intended, I decided it would be nice to spend some time at home this summer relaxing.  Then I remembered that my sister will soon be departing for the other end of the world, and there is no way I would spend a week in Wisconsin's Best Small City without a partner in sarcasm.  Three hours after a little visit to  urlLink Orbitz , I was on a plane.  My return flight isn't until this Sunday, so I'm taking this rare time of zero responsibility to do a little physical, mental, and emotional detox.  Step One is to kick the nicotine addiction.  I'm approaching Hour 50 right now, and, well, it sucks.  Despite the profound fatigue, dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, and extreme bloatedness, I've managed to get into a  urlLink good book  (haven't read one of those things in over a year, and, surprise to no one who knows me, my first venture back into the world of literacy is by a dead Russian guy) watch a very dated but entertaining  urlLink Clint Eastwood movie  (hot damn, they just don't make men like that anymore) and take my girl Babe out for a walk (she is a certified doggy senior citizen but was dragging me through the woods like a hyperactive puppy.)  So, given my rather catatonic and uncomfortable state (yes, Mom, I'm just tired from traveling,) my goals for today, Day Two, are to ride the stationary bike, make more progress in the book, compose a compelling e-mail to my boss such that I don't get fired for my sudden departure, and not be too unbearably cranky.  That is all.  Perhaps in a day or two I will be able to put on non-pajama pants and leave the house for a little bowling or shopping extravaganza at Target.  Alrightie, I'm off to the basement gym.  Since I hardly packed anything, I'll be exercising in my mom's t-shirt and shorts.  They are both made of hemp.

       The weekend is so close I can almost taste the beer and various grilled meats.  I'll be spending it on the island of Manhattan, which, save for a couple trips to Brooklyn, I haven't left in months.  This makes me sad, but at least for a whopping 3.5 days I will be free from balding middle-aged white dudes who call each other "brother" with a straight face.  Also, I just found this link and thought I'd take yesterday's nostalgia kick back a few more notches.  As a kid I was a bit of a tomboy--never wore dresses (except the plaid jumpers I was forced to wear to school every day,) played lots of sports, and most definitely was not a Barbie girl, nor in a Barbie world.  But I fucking LOVED  urlLink these things .  My favorite was made out of orange glittery plastic, and my mom bought it for me at ShopKo after I got my blood drawn for the first time and only kicked ONE of the four nurses brought in to hold me down.

       Once upon a time, the Summer of 2001, to be exact, my home was below 14th street.  Ellen, Chef Steph, and I lived in a prison-like NYU dorm called Third North, while  urlLink FAB  lived above the Subway (the sandwich shop and the train) on 14th and 1st.  Dr. Dre's  Chronic 2001  was our soundtrack as we lived, we learned, and we drank.  A lot.    *The Alannas.  As I said, three of us lived in the dorm.  The dorm's suites, however, were for four people.  I pitied the fourth girl before I even met her, as I sure as hell would not want to share a small living space with three girls who are already tight.  But I didn't have to pity her for long.  Alanna Number One had dyed platinum blonde hair, was in a sorority at one of those big southern schools, and wore hot pink thongs that "accidentally" peeked above her jeans.  She was in New York to study acting, and study she did, by watching movies on the common room couch all day while eating her diet of raw mushrooms with ketchup.  She moved out at the end of the first summer session and was replaced by, I kid you not, another Alanna.  Alanna Number Two made me long for Number One.  Number Two epitomized the Upper East Side JAP stereotype: she had her name monogrammed on her towels, wore Marc Jacobs, not Marc by Marc, and criticized the clothing choices of the attendees at her father's  urlLink best friend's  funeral (click that link--I am so not kidding.)  Her finest moment came when, after being away for the weekend, she found a brand new box of Cinnamon Life cereal on her desk (Steph had consumed what she'd had and replaced it with more than she'd had to begin with) and a rumpled comforter on her bed (I'd slept in her bed drunk and naked, but as far as she ever knew I just sat on it.)  I believe her response to this was, with classic bitch inflections, "Don't TOUCH...my STUFF."  Sadly, Alanna Number Two moved out before Steph and I could carry out our plan of mashing up Life cereal in the pockets of her Marc Jacobs pants.   *Finance 101.  The world was my proverbial oyster, as I had just gotten my first cell phone and my first credit card.  Surely my lucrative job at the  urlLink Doggy Daycare  and the parent-paid rent would allow me to use both with abandon.  Gina, meet Insurmountable Debt.  Insurmountable Debt, Gina.  (Three hundred minutes divided by twenty weekdays equals only fifteen minutes per day, and college sophomores who need to pay for their own books and food have no business going to Bergdorf and Barneys every weekend.  Nineteen-year-old Gina, you are a moron.)  But I'd deal with the crippling anxiety attacks later.  Nothing a little Wisconsin R&R and psychiatric medication can't take care of!  *Team Rockstar.  Now for the drinking.  There's just too much to talk about in one paragraph, but most of the drinking can be put into two categories: The W Hotel Union Square, and Danny Kane.  Aaaah the W.  I could write a novel about the drama that transpired at this place for all four of us, both together and individually.  But I am not exaggerating when I say that careers were made, hearts were broken, and free cosmopolitans (apple martinis when cosmos quickly became passe) flowed like water.  Then one fateful evening...somewhere, Steph and I were pulled into a basement kitchen by a man named  urlLink Danny Kane .  From then on, we were on Danny Kane's List, velvet ropes meant nothing, and we thought we were the shit, er, shizzle.   urlLink Michael Musto summed up that scene well .    Yesterday I received an email from Danny:   Subject:  your birthday  Please let me know if you want to have a birthday party.I know it's comin up this month.It won't cost you anything and I will give you drinks,and a free guest list.Please let me know by email or call me at 212-229-XXXX if your interested.  Thanks, Danny Kane   Thanks, Danny, but no thanks.  It was fun, but I think we've all moved onto *ahem* the next episode.

       Today is my very last day at JPMorganStanleyGoldmanStearnsLynchBrothers.  I'm so excited/scared shitless about leaving that I can't begin to think straight and will probably be on one constant smoke break all day.  Leaving pretty much every other thing I've been involved with for any length of time (e.g., summer camp, rowing, my little coffee shop job, hell...even high school) resulted in a healthy dose of sentimentality and nostalgia, but now I'm just feeling ambivalent.  I guess I'll miss the pickles that come with the sandwiches in the company cafeteria.  Those are the best damn pickles in the world.  Anyway, as I'm sure my final departure at 5:00 will result in no fanfare whatsoever, I feel I should bid farewell to those whom I have been seeing on a daily basis for the last year and 1.5 months and will likely never see again.  *Mainboss.  You are a wonderful boss.  Your sense of logic and down-to-earth nature (you have a wife.  and kids.  that you actually like and spend time with!) make me question what you are doing here.  Thanks for giving lil' ol' me a chance and a big-ass bonus with which I paid off all of my credit card debt, even though I've since replaced said debt.  I'm sure I learned something somewhere along the line.  *Stereotypicalboss.  Keep doing your thing at Spice Market, or whatever the new "it" place is.  *Fatboss.  While I will not miss your incessant playing of Hamsterdance and similar annoying-as-hell computer ditties, your rightwing diatribes and occasional temper tantrums were quite entertaining.  Stay away from those carbs!  *Twirlyman.  Thanks for introducing me to a psychological disorder I'd only heard about on Sally Jesse Raphael.  There are other ways to deal with your stress and anxiety, and if you seek treatment I'm sure the hair will grow back.    *Mr. Fartypants.  You really should see a doctor about that.  Or at least stop eating eggs and beans and excessive amounts of vegetables, for the love of all that is holy.  *Person who reads this site and also works at JPMorganStanleyGoldmanStearnsLynchBrothers.  You caused me to have a minor nervous breakdown when I was in Wisconsin and discovered that someone had viewed my website from the company domain.  I was SURE that it was my bosses and that, upon my return, I would be escorted out of the building by armed guards like Pre-Fatboss Crazyboss was six months ago.  I forgive you; you didn't know.  Best of luck, and may your bonuses be large.  *Princeton Girl.  Please eat a sandwich once in a while.  They have these really good ones across the street on multi-grain bread with avocado, cheddar, tomato, cucumber, sprouts, and a little mayo.  Deeelish.  Now, who wants to place bets on whether I get my shit together enough to continue paying my rent, or whether I curl up like a roly-poly bug, relinquish my cute and cozy apartment, and hide out in Wisco for the rest of my life?

       I've  urlLink said   urlLink it  before and I'll say it again.  OB/Gyn's need to stop giving crack to parents-to-be.  There is no other logical explanation for the travesties bestowed upon so many innocent babies.  I've always been pro-choice, but not when it comes to names.  There need to be government-sanctioned rules.    This weekend, my dear  urlLink FAB  became an aunt to a little boy with a name that will undoubtedly ensure his intimate familiarity with flushing toilets in the near future.  And then I read  urlLink this .  And then I went to the  urlLink Local Paper  to see what the bundles of joy in my hometown are being called.  In just one day at the Local Hospital, we have:  *A son, Braeden, joining a sister, Kamryn.    *Twins Roman Kenwood and Olivia Mae.  They're joining sisters Adeline and Evelyn and their last name is Paffel.  Maybe they'll grow up and make some bizarro Victorian/Wild West/Typical-Wisconsinites-of-Polish-and-German-descent reality show?  *Jaidyn Alexandria joining half-sister Desirae.  Vowels are fun to play with!  *Kelvin.  I will never understand this name.  Why not just go all the way and name the kid Celcius or Fahrenheit?  It would be more UNIQUE.  *And finally, the worst of the worst, Kia Lynn, joining sister Kiana Lynn.  Why must the kids be named almost the exact same thing?  And why must one be named after a crappy car?    Mark my words, should little humans ever come out of my body they may be genetically predisposed to various anxiety and depressive disorders, but they will not have stupid names!

       It was just brought to my eavesdropping attention that the blue-shirted, bekhakied dudes on my trading desk are meeting somewhere on Rivington Street this evening.  Goodbye, LES, it was nice knowin' ya.  Predictions for the next hipster neighborhood?  My vote goes to the Upper West Side.  Hey, it sure would be ironic.  Just imagine if all the kids grew out their mullets, wore their college sweatshirts with pride, and started using strollers instead of hobo bags?    Wessiiiiiide!

       Yes, folks, the time has come.  Today I was informed that this Wednesday I will be saying goodbye to the World o' Finance so that the eager beaver on the other side of the desk can take my place.  You'd think that in the past three and a half weeks I would have found new employment.  Well, you'd be wrong.  Part of my lack of aggression in the job hunt has to do with the simple fact that I do not really desire another job.  But another big part has to do with all the corporate bullshit that just makes me ill.  Sadly, jobs devoid of said bullshit, like, say, playing with rich people's dogs, would require living off of PB&J and denying myself the right to designer denim, simply in order to remain in my beloved 144-square-foot studio in the sky.    Coincidentally, today I received a newsletter from the temp agency I signed up with (and have been blowing off for weeks.)  Based on my allergy to words like "team-player," "self-starter," "multi-tasker," and "110%," I don't think I'm what they're looking for:   *Must love project work, be a great team player, have excellent Word, Excel & PowerPoint and be ready to give 110%. This is a great opportunity for someone who really wants to get involved with a talented and driven team.  *Person must be sharp, have very strong PC skills, including PowerPoint, be a successful multi-tasker and know when 110% just isn't enough.  [is 115% enough then?]  *Top global marketing technology firm is looking for a dynamic, take charge Executive Assistant to support the VP of Sales and Regional Director. This position is fast-paced, involves heavy scheduling and requires a take-charge assistant. A self-starter with strong written and verbal communication skills, the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously and a forward thinking mentality is required. [something tells me they want someone to take charge]  *A sense of urgency, terrific organizational skills and a positive energetic attitude a must. Will also have project work, such as helping with new hire orientations. Super-duper perks, fabulous environment and free Starbucks coffee! $28K [hmm, maybe if it includes free soy lattes]   I can almost feel my hives flaring up.  Wait, I don't have hives.  But I do have a couple of promising leads.  I'm "in the running" for a position at  urlLink Drone 's fancypants employer, and Stereotypicalboss, bless his heart, has connections leaking through his stereotypical dress shirt.  Nevertheless, I'll be stocking up on peanut butter and bread, rice and beans, and those microwavable cups of salt this weekend.

       Lately, sitting in front of the television eating dinner from Burritoville, Subway, or the freezer has replaced going to the gym as my post-work activity of choice.  Since there isn't much on TV at 6:00, I've been watching a lot of  urlLink Conan  reruns on Comedy Central.  With Dave getting old and tired and Jay's chin more annoying than ever, I've long considered Conan to be the late nite champ. Until I realized, that is, that literally every other joke involves derision of either his appearance or the show.    As you may have noticed, I have a rather self-deprecating sense of humor (see first sentence,) but there is a fine and definite line between funny and fucking annoying.  Yes, Conan, we know that you are unusually tall and have (gasp!) red hair and pale skin.  And yes, you were once the third wheel on the late nite circuit.  But you are not hideous, and, in fact, you are no doubt filthy stinking rich.  As for your show, you know it's been extremely successful, and "every aspect of [it] has been praised in the media."  Enough with the whining already.  (I must also add, since I know he'll do it if I don't, that  urlLink Dockgoose 's mother was Conan's high school Spanish teacher.)

       I think it may be time to pay a visit to an  urlLink old friend .

       It has long been said that Marshfield, Wisconsin is the New York City of the Midwest.  Both cities have people, and stores, and some grass here and there.  But while these cities are indeed strikingly similar, if you think long and hard some differences can be found.  For example, here is what locals are most concerned with in their respective cities.  *NYC.  On Friday when I left my big banker-type building in Midtown, I was greeted by several machine gun wielding police officers.  While I am generally one of the "try everything once" types of people, I can say with certainty that being within touching distance of a machine gun was one experience that was not missing from my life.  Also, hearing my superiors discuss who gets sent to our New Jersey offices in late August "in case something happens" just warms my heart.  As does returning to the office to see "Terror Threat:  Companies Prepare" on CNN along with a picture of the outside of my building.  *Marshfield.  An angered citizen writes to the  urlLink Local Paper :   Fri, Jul 30, 2004  Winner slighted in contest story  Editor: I am wondering why, when Smith Brothers of Colby won the pork cooking contest held during Hub City Days, their name and picture were not in the headline, instead of at the end of the story. I think that was very unfair.  ISABELLE BRENNER Curtiss   Oh Isabelle, if only I too could be so concerned about the proper recognition of the winners of pork cooking contests...

          Given that my ol' team's slogan was "Boozin' & Whorin'," a phrase coined by the coach, I expected that our reunion weekend in Washington, DC would be full of good times.  Indeed, upon my arrival at Maj's apartment at 1:00 Saturday afternoon, I was greeted with a glass of gin and juice and was told that everyone had "had a couple shots already."    The drinking continued at the train station where we waited for our Duck Tour of the city to begin.     It was windy in the back of that Duck.     Very very windy.     We did our part to annoy the real tourists with incessant use of our complimentary duck calls.  They seemed amused.  Maybe.     Maj and I always enjoy showing off our abs of steel, and this time they were enhanced by greek food and beer.     I just like this one.     And this one I think speaks for itself.     Next year, we rock the coast of Croatia.  At least that's the plan.
