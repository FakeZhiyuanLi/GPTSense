There are many people who walk in and went out of my life ... Some become part of my life while some left some beautiful memories to mi ... Thanks you, all my friends ...   Remember ... Let all those unhappy things stay away from our life ... No need to ask for reasons, cause if they want you to know they will just tell you ... Wad u asking is just maybe some forms of lies ... which wad for u wanna know ...  Who dun lie ??? ... even i do ... Haha ... But do u ever think of that ... Once you lie u will need another to cover up the front one ... That make u lying all the way ... That also make you a person who people will never ever trust ... Wad u say they will simply doubt ...

      CuRrEnTlY LiStEnInG To : BlAqUe - As If TiMe : SGT - 0148 HrS  Just came back from movie together with my parents. We watched The Best Bet "Tu Ran Fa Cai". Kinda funny and let mi realised alot of things about friends and money. The show is quite a good one. It had been long that the whole family go and watched movie together. That was a treat from my brother. Haha.   After movie, we went to had something. Reached home at about 1.38am. Then started blogging.   Father is nagging again, saying i had been sitting infront of the comp everyday. I hate wad he say. I always can't used the comp till midnight but why he nv ever say a word to my brother when he is also using the comp in the late night. Bias. Just because he came back for only a week then he can do anything he want not mi. Hate his form of saying mi. Using comp is my life, other than play comp, i will only watch TV, sleep or go out. He say sleep will make mi fat, go out waste of time, play comp also cannot, wad kind of father is this, only side my brother. Yah i know my brother studies result nv been so bad as mine but i had already put in my effort and everything i can do. Studying till midnight during exams, they say i study last minute. Sleep abit longer, they will say who ask u dun sleep early. Kaoz ... Really angry with wad they are treating mi. Always say that they nv expect much from mi, but wad they want is wad i cannot get to their expextation. Scold is wad they are good at.   My father still got the cheek to say mi, if he is really so good, why dun i see him at home everyday after my school. They dun even care about mi. I think wad i see the most is my comp more than them. Yah they came home at about 5 to 7 plus, but after having dinner they went out again. Say mi. So wad they are my parents, wad they did is just wad i learn. Going home late is an example. Talking back to them is also. Talk back them they will say "Heng li hai ding zui horx" but it is just simply they can't out talk mi, cause i was simply not in the wrong. Hope that they can think of themselves before scolding mi ......  [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-0208 Hrs

      CuRrEnTlY LiStEnInG To : DeLtA GoOdReM - InNoCeNt EyEs TiMe : SGT - 1055 HrS   Camp camp camp ... Well, my camp had just ended yesterday ... Although got some unhappy incident that let make me down but in at least I know wad is happening ..   First day of camp I reached school at 8.44am, at first meet Peiyu and Wanpin at the bus stop outside the school but they went in first.. So mi and KaiXin Went in to the library .. Saw Peiyu, WanPin, Shiqi and Meijun in the Computer Room .. Then we joined in ...Not long after we were being called to assemble and we were being divided into groups of 3. My group had around 15 ppl and our leader is Shiqi while asst. leader is KaiXin. We had to create a group name and group cheer. Our group name is Fruit Salad. After that, we went to the Reading Corner to pack the books... At 11.30am, mi, WanPin, Shiqi and Meijun went off for Physics remedial ... After remedial, we went to had our lunch. OMG, they bought Nasi Lemak but got a lot of chilli sia .. I dun eat chilli. Wanpin know that I dun eat chilli and she changed her white rice with mi and she eat those with chilli one.  (Thanks A lot WanPin ...)   After that we went to help KaiXin and Peiyu in packing up the water bomb. Very fun too. I also dunno why. LolX ! We went back to library to change and then went back to canteen and waiting for the games to start.  (Oh yah also Thanks to Amy for her slippers... Cause I forgot to bring mine...Blehx)  Then games started then kinda long story but not interesting so I am not gonna say about the details ..We went to bathe after games.. As for dinner, we eat Chicken rice ... Then we had treasure hunt. Our team won ...Ahems.. Then bring them to night walk and try to hide and scare them .. After that went to watch movie, The Haunted Mansion. Watch before liaoz but that was really a nice show. Then went back to library and going to lights off for the campers. Then we were in the room and wait or play comp cause there will be a patrolling later. I was in a group with KaiXin, Jeanette, Samual. At 1.30am, we went out to petrol.. But together with wanpin, peiyu, Jiahui and another guy name Kelvin. When we wanted to start at the running track, took a look at the gate and around. Wanpin said this was boring but as we had to report to Annie where we were, then JiaHui or Kelvin report back, "A car just pass by" then wee all laugh ... lolx..Not long after we walk away from the gate, a guy came and stood outside the school gate .. kinda weird and went to ask him wad is he doing there.. He look like a Ah-Beng to mi and then he say "This is my area" then I think, Ah-beng got in charge of school one mehz ...??? lolX .. Then he continued, he is Inspector ... ! LolX, a police ... Cause neighborhoods ppl called the police cause so late still got ppl in school.. Lolx .. Then we follow walking and patrolling .. Nothing found .. And went back to changed another group patrolling. It was Shiqi's group up next and so they went to petrol and TKB was with them while WanPin stayed in the library. Not long after, they reported back that there was a light in Computer Lab 6. OMG, mi, KaiXin, Annie and WanPin ran down.. We asked them to come back to the foyer... Then they ran back and TKB reaction was so funny ... Cause he nv wear specs so he cannot see properly.. Then he just saw some light and then he said " I saw light, white colour one, I also scared mahz, so they run lohz..." I heard and saw his actions... I keep laughing.. Really funny...We went back to library and then play comp .. Everyone was like damm energetic no one sleep. Until 3 plus, Shiqi and got ppl started to fell asleep. I wanted to sleep too, but the floor was too hard.. And I stayed awake and Meijun too... Until 5am everyone started to sleep and then we switched off the light and went out of tt room. I went out and feeling very cold ...   Second Day of camp At around 6.10am, mi and Meijun went to wake the campers up... At around 9 to 10 plus, I play comp and then fell asleep at the table ... At around 11 or 12 plus I wake up, but still feeling tired and TKB went in and and asked them out to do the noticeboard. Wanpin wanted to wake mi up but TKB stopped her but at that time I was already awake but still lying on the table.. Lolx .. All because of him lahz ...At first I can sleep at 8 but then gonna take care of the library then I sacrificed my sleeping lolX ... Nothing was done much on the second day and not interesting ...  That is how my camp was, although quite boring but still enjoy the time together with my friends....  [.J.u.S.t.P.a.S.s.I.n.'.B.y.]Signed off at SGT-1234 Hrs

      CuRrEnTlY LiStEnInG To : S.H.E -> ZHaO Bu DaO... TiMe : SGT - 2315 HrS   Erm .. let mi think .. today i went off my house at around 2.30pm to meet peiyu in the bus 198 ... But I dint make it cause I went to bought   batteries   for my precious mp3 .. lolx! Then we waited for another 198 to reach the bus stop behind the Jurong Regional Library so that we can take 176 to reach West Coast Park for the outing, BBQ that was held by S.H.E Faith ...  Not long after we reached but mi and peiyu was too shy to go over there as we dun really know them well ... So we sat on a bench not far from the BBQ pit and waiting for liwei, Christopher and kaixin ... We sat there for almost 1/2 an hour ... But the wind was so nice ... For several times ... The club members ask us over to join them ... But we dint...lolx ...  [*really paiseh lehz, to the ppl who came and ask us over ...]   Liwei they all came and we went to the BBQ pit there, they ask us to eat but at that time we was not hungry and went to stroll around in the park and then we also went to the MacDonald ... Very nicely built ... We went in and liwei ordered things to eat and I had French fries and apple pie too ... Went back at around 5.14pm and they had already started preparing and BBQ the food ... A group of gals came to us and introduced themselves to us ...  [*their name should be WeiLi, Joan, Emily, Christina, Evonne, WanSia]   They all are really nice and friendly ... And there is a guy too...   [*Name Eugene ba ..]   The ppl there are really nice but we dint really join in their conversation.. I wanted to help to BBQ food but there wasn't a chance for mi to do so .. I got helped but just fanning the food but there was so much smoke infront of mi and so I dint go fan the food but instead I fan the smoke away ... And yah ... kenna a guy say  " wha ask u go fan the food, but then u go fan the smoke .."  Pengz sia -__-"| ... No lah .. lolx !  We went off after eating ... Not went home but just gone to play at those playgrounds .. Kx and py went to climb the pyramid which I dint cause  I was scared  ... lolx .. and went to play so much thing ... it was so nice at there .. my mother called mi at around 9 plus and ask mi whether i wanna go home le, so she will pick mi up as she is on the way home .. so i agreed ... and also bring kx and py home .. while christopher and liwei took bus home .. We went back to the BBQ pit and guys are all packing up le .. we took our bag that we left it there earlier and drank orange juice ... and we went off and mi shouted "goodbye" to them .. quite embrassing .. i also dunno why ...  Went to mac and buy drinks ... walked to the bus stop and saw Evonne, WeiLi, Eugene and another guy which i dunno who .. they was taking bus home and so chris and liwei and them took the bus and go off first ... mi, kx and py waited for my parents at the bus stop ..  Soon after they came, first drop off kx first at the overhead bridge there and then follow by py ...Reached home at around 10 plus ... took a bath and came blogging ... wad a   long, tiring but fun day    ... That is how i had my day on 2nd June 2004 ....    (*Really thanks for letting us joining in the fun ... It is really great, thanks!!!)

Not long after the pre-parade started ..... Kinda sianz in the first place .... Crapping around and then the militery band started off .... so nice .... their formation was nice ....     Many performances went on but wad we were anxious and hoping is the fireworks .... as we were sitting at the back .... we were given an umbrella ... a nice transparent one ..... but after using we need to return back ... lolx ... when the fireworks started off at around 7.50pm .... we all were so high ... lolx ... we sang the national day songs and scream ..... lolx .... so happily and we really enjoy ourselves .... after that we took pictures....  (Thanks Kin Seng for lending me his camera)     At 8.10pm the parade was about to end .... Singing our national anthem and taking the national pledge, it seem so different when taking it in school ... We sang and say our pledge proudly ... then we waited awhile before heading out of the stadium.... outside was full of ppl ... damn crowded .. but lucky we managed to find our way out ..    Dunno where to walk ... but at last walked to a bus stop and we just boarded the bus without knowing where the bus would be going ... but that was a big mistake .... cause inside the bus wad damn smelly ... Oh Gosh! Really cannot take it sia ... and alight at somewhere near suntec city .... then took cab down to 'Lau Pa Sar' to have our dinner ...
