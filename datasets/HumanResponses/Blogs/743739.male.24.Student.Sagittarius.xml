       urlLink Offbeat Dollars for Scholars : "The annual duck celebration in Stuttgart, Ark., was winding down ? the Queen Mallard beauty pageant was over and the world's best duck dog had been determined. Then Daniel Duke stepped onto the Main Street stage.   Duke, a teenage veteran of more than a dozen duck-calling contests, wowed the judges with his renditions of the four required blasts: hail, feed, comeback and mating. Duke, from the nearby town of Brinkley, triumphed ? and bagged one of the nation's more unusual college scholarships.   'I knew I had a shot at it,' the 19-year-old said of the $1,500 award, which he hopes to use to attend the University of Arkansas. 'And I think it's pretty great you can get a scholarship for calling ducks.'"  --------------------------------------  I couldn't resist sharing this. My father is an Arkansas grad, I may have to call him up and ask if he received any duck hunting scholarships back in the day. Of course he will probably respond that he wasn't able to attend the contest because it was too far to walk in the snow, especially being uphill both ways. After I ask a follow up question, I will be informed that back "in the day" it used to snow in Arkansas even during the winter.

However, check out the boyfriends name. Magic Mackeigan. I bet his parents purchase items sold in spam email messages.

       urlLink Spam's dirty little secret - some buy its products : "According to a Yahoo! Mail global survey of about 37,000 Internet users in 11 countries, 20 percent of U.S. residents admit buying products from spam purveyors. About 78 percent said they delete spam."   -----------------------------------  Ok, this is why some people need to be shot. Normally I am not a big advocate of violence, but come one. This means that every company that can get my email address will send me junk, knowing that there is A ONE IN FIVE CHANCE that I’ll buy from them. ONE IN FIVE! That is absurd. Of course if anyone of my loyal readers happens to fall in the category and is offend by my comments..... too bad, I still think you should be shot. Besides we all know that no one reads this, I don’t even read this. (But then who is "we all?")

An ESPN film crew is coming to this Panhandle town next month to interview the family of 2-year-old ESPN Malachi McCall for a feature on several children around the country named after the network.   ESPN (pronounced Espen) McCall is one of at least three children in the United States known to be named for the sports network. A couple in Corpus Christi named their son Espn Curiel in 2000, the same year Espen Blondeel was born in Michigan."   ----------------------------------------------------------------  Wow, and I thought the name Asa was weird.... just kidding bud. However this article has provided me with inspiration. My first kid will be name Pepsi Coke Luttrell. Think about it, it works perfectly. Then all I will have to do is convince him (or her, doesn't really matter) to get a PhD and then the name will be Dr. Pepsi Coke Luttrell.

      QUICK, click  urlLink HERE     Ok, with that out of the way, let me tell you about last week. Last week I had the privilege of attending Falls Creek with Glenstone Baptist Church. This was I believe my 9th year at Falls Creek, being a sponsor for six of those. Although I am cheating on one of the years, I only spent a day and a half at FC last year and I was probably technically a guest, but in my eyes I am always in charge so who cares.   Hey, back to what is important. We had 3 salvations last week, which was awesome, and if any of those three are reading this, I want you to know I am proud of you and praying that you continue to grow in your relationship with Jesus. We also had a student commit her life to ministry. To this student all I can say is I know what lies ahead for you, and I am sorry.  For those of you who can't tell, I'm kidding. When called to it, there is nothing better than full time ministry.    In addition, I grew personally in my walk with God. Last week was a time of teaching for me, I taught the morning in cabin studies, and a time of prayer. While it was great to be teaching again, most of my growth came in the area of prayer. For many of us prayer is something that we do because we are supposed to, and then we sit back and hope God answers it. However I got to experience prayer as an exciting thing, and I got to see very quick results from it. Nothing is as exciting as knowing that you prayed for something one night, and then seeing it happen the next day.   Well it's time to pack for camp this week, we leave early tomorrow. For those of you who went to camp with me last week, feel free to post a comment below, I promise Asa dosn't bite.....often. You can just say hi, or even share your experiences from camp if you wish. Also, in addition to commenting, be in prayer for me and my church during the next week. Specifically pray that we see God's power in the area of salvations, just like we did last week.   Until I get back next week remember, same bat time, same bat channel.   Yeah, I had to do that

I spent a number of years in a North Vietnamese prison camp in the dark and (was) fed scraps, and I don't know why I would want to do that all over again,' McCain said at a rally in San Diego. "  On Sunday, McCain joked about being wooed by both Republicans and Democrats -- "next will come the Libertarian and vegetarian sides," McCain said.

      Well, this will be last post for a couple of days (at least).&nbsp; Tomorrow I leave for Oakland California, we thought about going to Chicago, but decided to see a real team play instead.&nbsp; The after a few days there, it’s onto Phoenix Arizona.&nbsp; For those of you who haven't heard me mention this with every other sentence I use, I did an internship there a couple of years ago and look forward to seeing everyone again.&nbsp; I’m just not sure if they look forward to seeing me&nbsp; =)  &nbsp;  Anyway, we leave at 6:30 in the morning, so I will not be here in the morning.&nbsp; If i see a reply before bed tonight, I might say something.&nbsp; If not, Asa, I leave this in your capable hands.&nbsp; If Martin gets out of hand, I expect you to head up to Missouri and pretend that he buys things from spam emails.

      It has come to my attention that there are people who read this and don't contribute their comments and responses (which means I have more than two readers....yay!).  This saddens me.  The thought that you would come here and partake of my intellectual offerings (ok this is not the time to look over previous posts) and not feel the need to contribute back makes me question your character.   Now I know that it seems like my intellectual (ok, I really hope I'm spelling that right) abilities are enough, or even more than enough, but I like to keep "the lesser ones" involved (right Martin?) so please post something that allows me to make fun of you.

      So let me see how much of my trip I remember; at the same time recording it for future generations.   Thursday (July 22)  All day spent traveling.  We ended up in Flagstaff AZ, the most expensive hotel city in American.  Ok, probably not, but when did the truth matter here?  Friday  Hey look, another driving day, but this time with flair.  After buying cheap gas in Kingman AZ, we headed north to see Hoover Dam.  This was also our first time to drive through a security checkpoint.  Apparently we didn't look like we intended to blow up the dam, and was allowed to drive across.  This was also the day to see Death Valley.  All I can say is appropriate name. Hey, did you know there are no roads going across central California?  Not even minor ones like we guessed there had to be.  So, we got to go north all the way past Yosemite and take a road that looks nice and straight on the map.  On the map.  Stupid map.  So its 11 pm and we are winding through curves going up and down mountains amazed that we haven't passed a town with a gas station in a long time.  a long time.  And yes, for those of you who can guess where this is leading, I can now say that I have been stranded for 2+ hours in a national forest in California.  Special thanks to Daniel Lions for helping us out there.  Saturday Ok, so really that last think carried over into Saturday and we got to Oakland at 9 in the morning.  The baseball game was an afternoon game so we took a short nap and then proceeded to Network Associates Coliseum.  Yes, the stadium is as awful as you have heard.  However it was nice to see other A's fans.  Also it was a 6-2 Oakland win, with Kotsey hitting 2 home runs and Dotel pitching the ninth (three straight strike outs).  More importantly, I am now a 1989 World Series Champion and I have the ring to prove it.  Take that, San Fran Giants.  Oh, also I burnt my head during this game.  Not Fun.  Sunday Church at Harvest something in Fremont CA.  Good praise and worship.  The pastor delivered a good message, but is younger and still needs some polish.  All and All a great experience. After church we headed over to Fishermen’s wharf.  Pier 39 I believe.  Let me tell you, I have never seen so many shops crammed into such a small space and the crab was amazing.  Yes those of you that I talk to often will hear about the crab, then hear about the crab, and possibly hear about the crab some more.  OH, I almost forgot.  We took the Bay Bridge to get to San Fran (where the wharf is).  Awesome experience, out of the three bay bridges we took, this was my favorite.  Of course I am bias by memories of the quake hitting this bridge during the 1989 World Series (which I won). After fishermen's wharf, we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge.  This was nice, but the fog was heavy.  This kinda made it cool, but also made it impossible to see the top of the cables supporting the bridge. Heading north, we crossed back over the third northern bridge that I can't remember the name of.  Awesome.  This bridge was huge.  Yeah, that’s all I'm going to say.  Monday If I was as cool as Willie Nelson, I would sing about being on the road again.  Instead I will just relate that we drove through Sequoia National Park, giant trees and nice mountains, on the way to Phoenix.  Another late night as we arrived at the hotel at 3am, I believe.  Tuesday Tuesday I slept.  Oh yeah and ate TCBY yogurt, losing that was the worst thing that ever happened to Stillwater.  Wednesday Umm yeah, more sleeping and TCBY that night.   Thursday Ill let you use your imagination, and yes, more TCBY.  Friday Mexico Day.  Yes, a quick jaunt into Mexico.  Also we saw the cacti at Saguaro National Park.  And driving, ended the day in Las Cruces New Mexico.  Saturday So driving through NM is boring.  The day ended in Amarillo Tx.  Some good bar b q and TCBY led us into bed time.  Oh yes, also I got to listen to the A's beating the rangers on rangers radio, that was fun.  Sunday Trinity Fellowship Church in Amarillo.  Rodger Hodges church, and if you don't know who Rodger Hodges, shame on you.  BTW Martin, he is the worship leader there.  So of course great praise and worship, Good message, then a 5 hour drive home.   So all in all it was a great trip.  Phoenix was a disappointment, my only plans were to see Bill Heaton, a local youth minister I once worked for, but our schedules never worked out for that to happen.  I must say it is great to be back home.  Even though the month started with two youth camps, only one was with "MY" group =), so I'm starting to feel separated from them (not necessarily saying that is bad).  Well, goodnight and remember, same bat time, same bat channel. (the really sad thing is that I continue that joke even though I doubt the target reads this.)

      Ok, quick trip recap.  11 days 4 states 2 countries  And upon comming home  4 messages on the ansering machine over 4000 emails  Yes, 4000 emails.  Thats not a complete number, becuase I have had to send and recieve more than 2 times already to get them all (outlook crashes, believe it or not).  So if anyone needs me, Ill be checking email for the next three years.
