       as you may have guessed, i am bored. Benji was supposed to get online at 4:30pm but i guess he forgot or something. or else someone else is using the phone. but anyways, just wanted to mention some songs that i really like.       Meiko Kaji  - Flower of Carnage    Zamfir  - The Lonely Shepherd    Al Hirt  - Green Hornet    Electric Light Orchestra  - Mr. Blue Sky    Hootie and the Blowfish  - Only Wanna Be With You      that's all for now. i'll write back later.

       ...and i'm still tired. i had a really weird dream last night that i was at a football game in cleveland and was sitting in the stands with drew carey. we were cuddling and kissing and stuff, even though his girlfriend was sitting right next to him..... weird, eh? and then i felt really bad because he cheated on his girlfriend AND kate, since he was cheating on his girlfriend with her too...       but i digress. today should be fairly boring, since my mom will be at work until 3:30pm and it's currently 11:34am. i'm kinda glad summer is almost over, it's getting pretty drawn-out and boring. i'm hungry again....i think i'll go heat up a frozen pizza. mmmm, pizza. anyways i'm gonna go now, not really a whole lot to say since, like i said, i just woke up.

       okay, i just started this thing...not really sure how all this stuff works, so i'm learning as i go along... and yes, this is the product of sheer boredom. and i guess it's a good way to vent whatever it is i'm feeling. and right now...i'm hungry. and a little bit sleepy. school starts August 9...only five days away. i'm kinda excited, since it's my last year of highschool, but then again i kinda dread it, since my boyfriend of nearly 10 months graduated last year and i won't be able to see him as much... i only get to see him on friday nights (actually it's more like three times a week, but mom doesn't know that) since my mom is extremely overprotective, and would rather me not date until *after* college.....which is kinda sad since i may *not* be going to college, despite what i tell her. i mean i might, i've been thinking about it...'cause i kinda wanna be a teacher. like a highschool teacher or something. i dunno, i've been toying with the thought, but nothing definite yet. anyways, i'm gonna go and fix me some hot pockets (yes i'm lazy) and go to bed soon. i'll write back sometime tomorrow i guess.
