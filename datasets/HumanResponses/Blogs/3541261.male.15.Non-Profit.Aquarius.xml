      Okay, I am in  major  nocturnal mode.  It's never a good sign when you go to bed when you normally wake up during the school year.  While sunrises are pretty neat when you stay up all night to see one, it's rather unfortunate when you sleep through both breakfast AND lunch.  On another topic different from my off the wall sleep patterns, I watched  Big Fish  for the first time.  While I had a lot of fun trying to analyze all the symbolism, I ended up totally befuddled by the end of the movie.  I mean, seriously, WTF?  Though, now that I've watched that, I have a sudden craving to watch  Alice in Wonderland .  Not the cheesy animated Disney Alice, but the awesome one with the White Knight and Turtle Soup; I remember watching it as a kid and being utterly amazed, but I can't find the video cassette we recorded it on.  I managed to find a copy of the summer reading assignment for World History in sophomore year at Hebron.  Holy crap.  If you think  The Once and Future King  by T.H. White is boring, Huston Smith's  The Illustrated World's Religions: A Guide to Our Wisdom Traditions  is downright brutal.  I can endure the Wart and Merlyn's Bunsen burners, but with my religious beliefs teetering between atheism and agnosticism I'd rather not spend my summer reading about how Grunthar formed the tiki-tiki tribe out of straw and mud in the South Pacific.

      As many of you know, there was a torrential downpour that occurred today around 1:30 in the afternoon. Instead of waking up to the normal sound of buzzsaws (no workers today!), I woke up to the sound of water violently pounding on my bedroom window. I sort of turned over on my side, looking at the wall of water outside, thinking that it would surely be awful if someone was caught outside in that kind of rain.   Then I realized that the only thing keeping the water out of the media room and several other points of the house was a piece of plywood precariously duck-taped to the rim of the window frame. And I was the only one home.   Now normally I'd start panicking at this type of situation, but fortunately Gladys was present to do that for me while I investigated the damage. Fortunately the presumably very expensive hardwood floor was unscathed, but by the time I got there a closet was already taking on water. Overall report; no  major  damage, but we apparently have some basset hairs a couple fancy-like oriental rugs because  somebody  decided to adopt some new liberties while I was racing around for fresh towels to mop up the puddles.   ...  I also had a long-winded post about yet another Star Wars Galaxies experience.  But somehow along the way, half of it got deleted; I'll just let you all die of anticipation while I finish it up another time.

       More workers came to the house today.  Now instead of waking up to buzz saws and Mexicans yelling for more supplies, I woke up to the smell of   noxious fumes  .  Apparently they started staining the crown molding in the media room.  Twelve hours later I'm   still   nauseous.  Today I realized that it's perfectly good to be as short as I am.  It's good to be short.  I don't have to put up with all the pressures that you feel when you're tall, like worrying if people will be attracted to you or if you'll ever play professional basketball.  Besides, being short is cool; you know, all that cool air sinks down to the ground. And stuff.  Every day for the past few months I've taken a capsule of this anti-acne medication.  It's designed to destroy the slightest chance of a minor blemish on my absolutely perfect skin.  Well, I took a look at the side label on the bottle of pills.        You should avoid prolonged or excessive exposure to direct and/or artificial sunlight while taking this medicine.    ...  Score!

      Yet again, I haven't been keeping up with my projected "daily" posts.  You can thank reconstruction for the duration of last week's posts, and partially for the weekend's.  You see, I was forced to evacuate my original work station and move my computer to my brother's old room.  I can't concentrate to make a post amidst the buzz saws and incomprehensible cries for  un poco mas   of what I'm pretty sure was wood (apparently I won't be going a long way in this world with only Second year Spanish).    As a minor note, learn from the mistakes of the Hispanic trim-carpenters that worked on the crown molding in the media room; before you start singing old Beach Boys tunes Karaoke-style in the midst of your work, make sure that the owners of the house had officially exited the building, and that there isn't a rather confused fifteen-year-old student barricaded in the library downstairs, trying to read Once and Future King.  And if you  do  feel the sudden urge to do so,  please  sing in a key that doesn't make the resident basset hound start baying outside.  The nights had been preoccupied with my rediscovery of a new favorite game,  Tropico , which basically simulates the stereotypes of a Caribbean island dictatorship.  After a week of experimentation, I've found that it's nearly impossible for me to complete a game without the Communists and Militarists loving me and the Religious Zealots and Environmentalists hating me.  Fortunately, popularity doesn't matter anything to me as long as the citizens don't figure out that El Presidente's private Swiss bank account somehow quadruples amount of the dwindling National Treasury...  I was seriously considering posting at the beginning of this weekend (honestly!).  But unfortunately, some poor planning severely backfired on me.  My computer, currently the center of my existence in this world and my   only   link to the outside, had been placed in my brother's old room, and    my brother was staying for the weekend.     Imagine setting your base camp in a rather cozy cave out in the wilderness.  You camp there for numerous days until you come upon the realization that the cave had been the residence of a rather unsociable bear, and that the bear had just returned to its home for winter shelter.  You flee for safety and narrowly escape with your life.  Later you realize that you had left the keys to your Jeep Cherokee in the bear-infested cave, and that it was more than 500 miles to the nearest outpost.  Add the fact that the bear also has l337 ninja grizzly skillz, and you're getting pretty close to the situation I was in.

      NortonAntiGrease: If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.  Garof 512: If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, be real quiet and make yourself as big as possible, because if you're going down you can always take some pedestrians down with you.   ...  I went to the dump transit-station today. Apparently we had to dump off some debris   leftover from the renovation.  As much as throwing pieces of wood with all these nails that look like they could inflict some seriously gnarly wounds into a huge concrete pit is fun, I noticed something;                                                                                                                                                                           people throw away a lot of good stuff!    Seriously, people.  If you've got a perfectly good water cooler, or teddy bear, or a  WORKING STEREO , do someone else a favor and PLEASE donate it to the Goodwill!  If you don't like helping other people less fortunate, at least realize we don't want your crap decomposing in our soil for the next millennium.  Still, some things are meant to rot instead of being transferred to some other schmuck, like the pair of boxer shorts I saw neatly laid out at the bottom of the great concrete pit...

      Yeah, I haven't really been keeping up with my posts.  A combination of the whole reconstruction of the upstairs of my house, and a particular Russian just not caring, brought that.  Still, my life keeps on going.   urlLink    What we've been doing for the past week...&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Window&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    There was a screen here, remember?&nbsp; urlLink     For one thing, the media room is coming up nicely.  For guys that can't speak English, the people that are working for us really kick ass when it comes to interior design.  Despite their amazing talent, the resident basset hound is not taking kindly to their presence.  Gladys usually sleeps for most of the length of the weekday; however, the constant sounds of nail guns and buzz saws has kept her awake for the duration of the week.  She started from distressed wailing and baying on Monday to   growling and snapping at the carpenters   on Friday.  She gets cranky without her extra beauty sleep.  Fortunately, we're just going to drug her come Monday so we won't have to deal with her obnoxious attitude for the duration of the construction; we love her dearly, but she's a pain in the neck, so we'll probably give her half of a children-strength chewable Grape-flavored cold pill to knock her out for about 8 hours a day.  Plus, I bet she'd be tired if I ever woke her up at 2:30 in the morning, "just to say hi."  **cough**.   urlLink    Sleeping Beauty AWAKENS!&nbsp; urlLink     Things haven't really been fast-paced in my personal life lately.   Wake up to hammering and buzz saws; take shower; get dressed in the same clothes you've worn all week since you're too lazy to do laundry; grunt at electrician dudes; eat something; play Star Wars Galaxies; eat something again; watch TV and/or play games; go to bed at 3:30 in the morning.   Every other day we'll add a   take the dog for a walk because she's being a pain  , but that's about it.  I'm still considering the whole "Get a Life" thing, but I'm pretty much stranded here until the renovation is done (Apparently we can't just leave while the guys are working on the house...).  Though on the bright side, I  DID  solve world hunger.  My first impression was Cannibalism, but that turned to be a rather touchy subject (Which one's dinner?).  However, I finally found a decent solution the starvation of humanity.  Gather up all the fast food chains in the United States; McDonald's, Burger King, even minor ones like Whataburger (who even eats there?).  Announce that they have one full year to select a representative of their corporation, and train them to be  WARRIORS OF DEATH!   At the end of the twelve months, host a battle royale in which only one combatant is left standing.  After the bloodbath is completed and the victor declared, have him draw a slip of paper out of a hat; the name on that slip of paper is the corporation that will feed the world's poverty-stricken at no charge whatsoever,  FOREVER !  ...  Okay, so I started out thinking that a Last Man Standing battle would be an awesome way to solve world hunger.  But then I realized that "The Last Man Standing Gets To Feed The World" isn't such a good incentive to fight for, so I was forced to add the hat part in to put things straight.  Still, we could make it a really cool hat to make up for it, like the Mad Hatter's hat, or one of those badass hats with the twirly propellers on top.  Oh yeah.   urlLink    Badass.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Dude.&nbsp; urlLink     Someone asked a while back what my Dad does for a living.  Well, here's a nice summary of it; he works at Granite Construction Company as an engineer on really big heavy construction jobs.  Here's a shot of a dam being constructed in Arkansas (though I don't really know why those rednecks need water in the first place).

      Lately I've been forced to help out around the house in preparations for the upcoming army of construction guys.  Just yesterday I actually had to work   outside   in the hot sun, trimming the hedges around the fence.  As I stood out there with my hedge clippers, several things crossed my mind.  For one, why should I be trimming these things in the first place?  In my opinion, it would be better to just let them grow wild, thus blocking out the view of the spawnling five-year-olds next door.  The fact that they idolize me as some sort of Russian Demi-God only reinforces my motives to stand back.  As a way to cope with having to do manual labor, I created a sort of barbaric alter-ego.  Thus, Kründ, Destroyer of Worlds, was born.  Kründ, Destroyer of Worlds, soon realized that he had abeen demoted to Kründ, Trimmer of Hedges, however; the situation didn't get any better.  Today I woke up to the sound if buzz saws and hammers.  Cut short of my daily 12 hour beauty rest, I turned my attention to my basset hound, Gladys, who was extremely distraught.  Imagine being a dog, and one day half a dozen men who smell like cheap aftershave burst in and start tearing out the carpet.  She's been pissed off all day (And when Gladys is pissed off she makes sure everyone else is, too).  And speaking of pissed off puppies, I recently met a new player on Star Wars Galaxies.  After a minor investment or two, I signed the greaseball up to the Rebellion and I now have my very own loyal attack dog.  I even stitched him up a new set of clothes; instead of wearing a cheap set of used Bone armor, he now wears a cheap suit of fashionably-made clothes.  But he still looks like a pissed off puppy.    urlLink    The New Player&nbsp; urlLink     Yeah.  That's Jason Gough's character, too; thanks for letting me use your tailor Jason! Even if you didn't know about it!    urlLink    The Media Room, Before...&nbsp; urlLink     There's a snapshot of the media room before the work started.  It's taken in the middle of the room.

      As you can see in my profile portrait, I'm already taking pictures using my digital camera.  Sadly, I'm still trying to figure out how to post the damn things on the blog as I've seen other people do.  Hang tight, folks!

      Today I invested in an X-Box so I could play the new army simulation, Full Spectrum Warrior.  I've only gotten through the tutorial and wargames, but I can already tell you that I'm completely satisified after hearing the phrase "You don't have to tell me to blow sh** up twice,  sir !"  Later I plan on playing the game with my compatriot to the south, Stpehen, over X-Box Live (once I figure out how the thing works, that is).  Even though the whole "Starting a new game while trying to cut down on computer-hours" thing is kind of hypocritical, my day wasn't   totally   centered on blowing things into tiny bits.  I woke up today to the sound of some random construction guys barging into my hibernation.  You see, we're having this huge reconstruction of half of the second story in my house - billiards room, hallways, and apparently parts of certain bedrooms.  While this sounds absolutely great for my personal interests, its going to cause a lot of mayhem in my personal living conditions.  I.e., waking up to the sound of buzz saws and being evicted from my room for days at a time until certain noxious fumes have subsided.  I'll get some Before and After pictures posted here whenever I can find the digital camera, along with a profile portrait and a few other snapshots as well.

      I decided to be a pawn in what you people call society and created my very own blog.  And thus, I had my very own little slice of bandwidth to call my own!  Now I can write whatever I damn well want, and I might even have a few traffickers to acknowledge it!  Hey, give me some credit - at least I'll be getting a lot more attention than I   was   used to get.  Summer hasn't even sunk in for two weeks now, and I've already come down with a severe case of cabin fever.  A year ago I would have been perfectly fine with sitting in a small room all day, living it up with the Voices and a set of computer and Playstation games.  After a full year at Hebron, I've apparently become more dependent on human contact.  I'm actually looking for people I knew at school to talk to.  Yeah, I know, Malutich actually caring about other forms of life out there - scary, huh?  I was kind of hoping that my one-person universe would hold up for a lifetime.  I'm looking into meeting people over the summer break, and I've been trying to cut down on my daily gaming hours. Star Wars Galaxies and my plethora of other entertainment programs are great and all, but I really do need to start seeking outside interests.  I'm going to start polishing off Hebron's summer reading list, including   Once and Future King   (To CAMELOT!) and find some potential extracurricular activities for sophomore year.  While I want to find some combat-oriented class to keep me in shape (Like I need it, you all know I've got a waiting list that far extends Los Angeles traffic records for Friday night dates), I don't want to become some white Ninja geneticist like my brother.  There's nothing more pathetic than facial carpet burns after a day's lessons.  Anyway, enough for now.  I've only got so much to say, and I don't want to overdo my avid fans in just one post...

       Not a lot has been happening at the Malutich residence.&nbsp; I'll sleep in (if Stephen and Stef aren't around - curse you two!), bathe, and screw around on X-Box or the computer all day.&nbsp; I evacuated from Stephen's room and moved the computer into the room adjacent to mine today ("Jack and Jill" configuration, meaning they're connected by a bathroom).&nbsp; Not only have I strengthened my defenses by colonizing the frontier, but also I'm that much closer to a bathroom...   It has been decreed that I shall purchase a fez.&nbsp; No, not that guy from  That 70's Show , the HAT.    urlLink   &nbsp;    Not the same kind of Fez&nbsp; urlLink         It all started a few nights ago when I was working my ass off after dinner with Stephen, Stef, and the family.&nbsp; I was frantically cleaning up the dishes, and I somehow made the comment about me being a Monkey Butler.&nbsp; Everyone thought it was funny - I think my subconscious wants to show them up by actually getting a Fez.&nbsp; I already had a preference for Fezes beforehand; my Friar in Dark Age of Camelot wore one into combat with pride.&nbsp;     However, I am not one to go and buy a Fez without investigation.&nbsp; I simulated how I would look wearing such exotic headwear using my computer and a handy digital camera.&nbsp;      &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;     urlLink     Fez-Tech Corporation Virtual Fez Simulation System, v.3&nbsp; urlLink       Badass, I know.&nbsp;     Still, there'll be a lot of snickering about the Monkey Butler business.&nbsp; But ask yourself this; is being a monkey butler  really  that derogatory?     &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;     urlLink    The Monkey Mafia&nbsp; urlLink

       My parents have always told me that crime doesn't pay.&nbsp; Well, I know for a fact that it doesn't pay when you run off with your tail between your legs because of the security alarm before you can grab some phat lewtz, that's for sure.     &nbsp;   Today&nbsp;at around&nbsp;4:30&nbsp;A.M.&nbsp;we had an attempted break-in at the Malutich residence.&nbsp; I had just gone to bed after a long night of "beta testing" the unfurnished media room's entertainment system (X-Box + bigass projector screen = happy greaseball).&nbsp; Less than fifteen minutes after I get into bed, the Brinks home security system starts screaming.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   I wasn't exactly happy; if you have Brinks, you know that it is effin'  LOUD  when it goes off, and I had a NyQuil in my system so I wasn't exactly ready to jump into action.&nbsp; My parents thought there was an electrical fire going on upstairs, and my dad rushed up to my room to make sure I was okay.&nbsp; As flattered as I am by this, my dad prefers to sleep in his underwear, so you can imagine a half-dazed Alex's reaction to all this.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Meanwhile, all hell is breaking loose downstairs.&nbsp; We shut off the whooping alarm and made sure that the area was secure.&nbsp; Soon we discovered that&nbsp;someone was trying to force entry at both the laundry room door that leads directly to the side of the house, and through one of the Master Bedroom windows where the foliage is not as dense.     &nbsp;   I've been trying to fit the entire incident together piece by piece since 5:00 this morning.&nbsp; From what I can tell, the perpetrator(s)   had waited for a deal of time after I had shut off the blaring X-Box&nbsp;that can evidently be heard from outside (or just by coincidence came upon us after I had gone to bed).&nbsp;They either tried entering through both the back window and the side door at the same time, or&nbsp;more likely&nbsp;tried the window first but felt that the side door would be a better entryway since there's a lot of furniture blocking the windows.&nbsp; They used a professional lockpick to pick open the deadbolt lock on the door, and broke part of the tool inside the lock.&nbsp; When they opened the door even slightly, the alarm went off, and they ran.      The choice of entry points still boggles my mind.&nbsp; Why the would-be burlgars chose the side door instead of one of the two back doors is a mystery.&nbsp; However, it's rather obvious why they chose the laundry room door instead of the door directly next to it that leads to the garage; there's a&nbsp;foot and a half high doggy door that's designed for a large dog like a German shepherd or the previous owner's French poodle embedded in the dark gray doorway.&nbsp; They obviously thought that a beast was sleeping beyond the semi-transparent door plastered with puppy-grease, and thus went through the laundry room door, which holds a large pane of glass covered by wooden blinds.&nbsp; This would have proved to be a horrible assumption if the home security system hadn't gone off.   What the burglars didn't realize is that Gladys, the resident basset hound,  doesn't  sleep outside.&nbsp; Due to an incident in her puppyhood where a group of racoons invaded the garage while she&nbsp;resided there (we found her quivering underneath the water heater the next morning) and the fickle weather of Texas, she sleeps in the laundry room.&nbsp; With her bed next to that same door.&nbsp; Preventing the door from being opened more than half a foot ajar.     Now, Gladys' appearance isn't very intimidating .&nbsp;  Especially when she's posing in her Angel Wings at Christmas...     urlLink     Malutich Studios presents "Sad Girl With Wings"&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;   However,&nbsp;the&nbsp;genetic makeup of a basset apparently&nbsp;shares the legs and obnoxious-ness of a beagle combined with the body, ears, and  lungs  of&nbsp;a bloodhound.&nbsp; This dog mimicked the sounds of sea lions when she was a puppy on the coastal town of Monterey, and sounds an awful lot like something that would enjoy eating some rather important outlying appendages for breakfast.&nbsp; If the burglars had opened the door as far as they could, they would have hit the side of Gladys' foam bed and presumably either her head or her rump, depending on the way she was sleeping.&nbsp; They wouldn't have been able to open the door at all (it's literally impossible to do so without moving the bed), and they would have had a very  loud, pissed off hound  baying at them at the other end of the door.&nbsp; While I'm glad they didn't even get past the walls of our home, it would have been much more satisfying for Gladys to prove that she isn't the ninny she usually portrays herself as.

      Today I started up a free 7 Day trial on Horizons: Empire of Istaria.  I had originally recieved this game last Christmas when it released.  I basically felt that it sucked; however, I've been pressed for entertainment lately, so I gave it a try.    I found the game quite amusing, at first.  I was amazed at the crafting system improvements, and happily chopped away at the flora and fauna in order to create a new set of stat-enhancing clothes for character.    As I was adventuring, I happened upon a gnome known as "Sammy Specialpants."  Sammy Specialpants offered the secret to making Specialpants if I made five Special Spools of Special Thread.  Wanting a pair of these l337 trousers, I quickly accepted the offer and finished the task.  The Schematic called for forty separate Special Spools...  Twenty minutes of Special Thread crafting later, I finally was at a loom and stitching together the mysterious Special Pants.  The item's description stated that it was "rated #1 in pants quality!" so I was obviously making a wise investment.  Finally, I crafted the pants and tried them on, anxiously awaiting my uber greaves of peril.      urlLink    "Special Pants"&nbsp; urlLink     I spent over half an hour making a damn pair of boxer shorts with hearts on it.  God, I hate gnomes.  (I'm in the process of canceling the account, since I felt that I could be doing something better than bashing giant animated maggots all day.  However, Artifact Entertainment currently has me baffled; I've got to call in Customer Service in order to cancel the account...)

       urlLink    "For Suckers"&nbsp; urlLink     ...  I actually went to bed at 12:30 last night, which is absolutely amazing by my standards.  I was expecting to leave early to take my dog to the Vet to get her toenails clipped (because it takes a medical professional to sedate her enough in order to let that happen), so I took a NyQuil and decided to bite the bullet. Ironically enough, I still woke up at 2:30 in the afternoon because my mom forgot to wake me up, when it was her idea to use me as a minion in the scheme of taking Gladys to the Vet in the first place.  Sigh.

      The other day someone called me an Imperialistic Nazi.   Now all of you know I don't actually  do  the whole "outside" thing, so I'm obviously talking about Star Wars Galaxies here. It'd be a good idea to read this part of the post even though it's mostly dribble about some idiot Star Wars game that I play while I wait for the remodeling to be finished, since there's actually some useful content in here.   You see, I was walking around town after being revived from a rather nasty incident involving a pair of Rebel characters (I still can't figure out how I can miss using a katana on an overweight Wookiee, but a human can throw a small pack of the Star Wars equivalent of  ANTHRAX  80 meters at me and hit with extreme precision). Since I'm a  Lieutenant, I was marching around and abusing the Imperial garrison for stress relief, which can't retaliate since I'm a L337 comissioned officer.   Then, out of nowhere, a random Trandoshan dude emanates out of nowhere. For those of you who follow infidelic behaviors and don't play Star Wars Galaxies (and thus have given me many lonely nights), a Trandoshan is a really big humanoid lizard.    urlLink    Leeezard!&nbsp; urlLink      Apparently the guy's using a free 14-day account given to subscribers of Fileplanet.com, a marketing ploy of Sony Online Entertainment. I deeply despise nearly everyone who uses these free accounts, because most of the people who do tend to harass law-abiding players. (A few days ago on my Rebel, I witnessed another Imperial walk into a cantina and threaten to "rape" some Rebel dancer girl if she didn't start doing everything he commanded. What he didn't realize was that she was also grouped with a large number of Rebel patrons in the same cantina, including me. The guy was dead before he hit the ground.)     Since he was also Imperial I let him off easy and decide to leave the poor sucker alone. But, of course, he has to make things worse for himself.    Lil-Jimmy Leeeezarddude says: Wud u giv me stuf fro free? Evree1 helps n00bs!    Ladies and gentlemen and Stephen Malutich,  I AM FANATICAL ABOUT GOOD TYPING SKILLS.  I literally taught myself an enhanced vocabulary through reading books and learned to type by playing online games. I understand that not everyone has excellent computing techniques, and that not everyone spells well. But when you use "ne1" in replacement for the word "anyone", my eyes start to glaze over and a small but strong voice in the back of my head starts singing Dixie.   Not only do I hate people who purposely mispell words, but I also hate begging. The simple fact is,  beggars in online games are lazy . I would be sympathetic that you needed money because there's been a draught for ten years, the family goat Benito died, and little Esmerelda was sick with typhoid and needed medicine. But when you're playing an online game where there's an infinite job market, you can go kill small woodland creatures for cash rewards!   Now normally I'd actually help out a new character, especially an ally. In fact, I picked up tailoring skills so I could stitch up the poor saps some new threads. But considering this guy represented a lot of things I hate, and that my hair and ego was still matted with the blood of the encounter with the walking carpet and Mr. Golden Arm, I pondered about what to do.    urlLink    Hmm...&nbsp; urlLink      As Lieutenant Garof Veparode, I asked Lil-Jimmy Leeezarddude what his name and rank was; Lance Corporal Leeeezarddude replied. I asked him if I looked like a Steward or other low-ranking petty officer; apparently he didn't know what the @$!* a Steward or a petty officer was, but he thought that because I dressed in an expensive trenchcoat and wore my hair back like "a big city banker" I would have a lot of cash on hand.    urlLink    Slick Cuban Banker&nbsp; urlLink      Sadly, I do look rather suave.  In rebuttal to this, I gave the schmuck an offer he couldn't refuse; if he could defeat me in a duel to the death, I'd give him some change.  What he didn't realize was that this was a win-win situation for me; if I didn't manage to kick his ass and get a few laughs from it all, I would be revived in a cloning center halfway across the planet.  The scene that followed resembled a luke-warm pancake being launched into a brick wall.  As many may have already predicted, I have no life; however, these little incidents make great "fillers" when I don't have anything else better to talk about.  ...  Some time between the last time I went to sleep and the last time I woke up, a big-ass French bar buffet was moved into the media room/pub.  This thing is HUGE.  I would have posted a nice picture up here, but I somehow misplaced my digital camera.  I'll try to have it up ASAP.

      "The destiny of Man is to unite, not to divide.  If you keep on dividing you end up as a collection of monkeys throwing nuts at each other out of separate trees."      -- King Arthur Pendragon,  as portrayed by T.H. White   ...  I had the first dream last night that I've had in months, which probably resulted from the reading of  The Once and Future King  right before I fell asleep.  It basically simulated medival combat in a way where nobody actually died, so a person could be skewered by swords and spears and only walk away with minor bruises. The strongest fragment I can remember was when I lead a squad of pikemen (all students I knew from Hebron) against a rather rowdy bunch of JROTC cadets.  While it may be noteworthy that there existed both pikemen and pikewomen, a person pointed out to me earlier today that "the likelihood of a suit of plate mail being suited for the figure of the fairer sex would be rather unlikely" (Thanks for ruining it for me).  Still, the rare chance at a dream was welcomed, and I rather enjoyed yelling out commands like "  FORM UP YOU MAGGOTS!  ."  I just hope that I wasn't talking in my sleep again; the Hispanic ladies that were painting the crown molding in the hallway outside my room gave me a  really  funny look when I went downstairs for lunch this afternoon after I woke up...  Speaking of waking up, Stephen and his special friend Stef have taken a liking to waking me up in the morning (or more often than not, in the afternoon).  I believe it's come to the point where Stephen looks forward to coming home from Texas A&M just to wake me up instead of actually staying with me.  Stephen gets more obnoxious when he has someone to egg him on, and Stef has  really  cold hands.   I've come up with two solutions to my problem; either go to bed earlier, or get more fashionable sleepwear so that I can be prepared for their arrival.  Considering I'm typing this at 2:40 in the morning, I'm going to go for the latter of the two.  Stephen accidentally left a few important pieces of luggage behind when he returned South to College Station yesterday.  How he managed to leave his waterproof Oakley backpack, two pairs of cargo pants, and his all-knowing TI-89 graphing calculator that he  needs  for class astounds me.  How he managed to pack his copy of  Prince of Persia: Sands of Time  but  leave both of his X-Box controllers behind  COMPLETELY BOGGLES MY MIND.

      Garof 512: apparently my mom was telling me how I had this affinity with the goats at the kindergarten petting zoo Garof 512: the goats all gathered around me, I was like the prince of goats jjoeeyy: haha wow jjoeeyy: maybe you should like have a goat farm Garof 512: Nigel: Goat Whisperer jjoeeyy: wow jjoeeyy: you can like genteically engineer them or somethign Garof 512: gasp, goats with laser vision jjoeeyy: aweosme jjoeeyy: or like jjoeeyy: make them larger than usual jjoeeyy: so you can ride the Garof 512: hyper-space goats of doom Garof 512: yeah, I wanna go freeway speed on a goat the size of an elephant jjoeeyy: that would be great Garof 512: plus I'd like to see the police trooper that had the guts to pull over a guy on a goat Garof 512: I mean you don't even need a license to ride one! jjoeeyy: uh huh! Garof 512: I think stephen once made an essay on how goats are valuable to the golf industry, apparently they can eat poison oak without getting sick jjoeeyy: uh hhh Garof 512: that way you can just hire goats to mow the lawns and hack away the poison oak jjoeeyy: nice!  ...  I haven't been online lately due to the upstairs renovation.  The hardwood floor upstairs was scraped to provide an old-world touch, and stained so that it didn't look so ugly.  I believe they won't be coming back for any more staining, so I can stay up here for good; I was really getting sick of sleeping on an air mattress in the library, even if I did get some of  Once and Future King  out of the way.  Well, while I was absent from the web, I played a lot of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  The game is so awesome that there's not a lot to say about it.  However, I've noticed that I'm having a  very  difficult time staying on the light side of the Force.  Unlike my brother, who's too gimpy to tap into the true power of the Force, I seem to be somewhat accustomed to the Dark Side.  I believe this may be a direct result of my association with all my "questionable" friends at school.  As I recall, this basically includes everyone except most females like Jennifer(mentioned above) and the occasional Bible-nut.  Thanks, guys - I'll remember the little people that helped me along the way to my first war crime.  I ate at Scotty P's tonight, which was extremely welcomed by me since I've been  stuck at home  for so long.  This was at eight o'clock; the floor stainers arrived at five.  I don't know what pisses me off more - the fact that they were supposed to arrive at noon, or the fact I spent the entire day offline since we were expecting them to arrive any minute.    When I was eating, I noticed that Saddam was being charged for his crimes on the news - w00t.  I also noticed a group of rather obnoxious children who kept screaming next to me.  As much as the "Spiderman Cookie Monster" was probably interesting, I would have probably done anything for the ability to Force Choke, even if it were for a few moments.  I usually hold a particular dislike for children.  I really don't know why, either; I had a pretty miserable childhood when it came to the other kids, so I suppose the treatment I received back then is reflected in the faces of today's youth.  Maybe I really just hate how pathetic I was back then, and I see myself in others.  Perhaps its the fact that I can never TALK to them, because with my vocabulary and level of intellect I might as well be speaking Japanese or Russian.  Bleh.

      I just got back from my little sabbatical at College Station. Apparently, the TV was not going to be delivered last Thursday; in fact it wasn't going to be delivered this WEEK. Instead, I spent most of the time hauling Stephen's crap up a flight of stairs in 100 degree weather and reading my World Religion textbook. I also spent a great deal of time using Windex on anything with a glass, leather, or metal finish (i.e. 3/4 of the entire apartment). I dropped my title as Krund: Destroyer of Worlds and metamorphicized into a more believable Krund: Polisher of Shiny and Expensive Things.  ...  On the way to College Station I got a first-hand look at how most Rednecks live their lives. Among the many items I saw whiz by at 60 miles per hour, I noticed an extremely worthwhile purchase. Spraypainted in white on the windshield of the tattered school bus were the mystifying symbols: FOR SALE, 95.00.  I had a vision. A vision of an ultra-bus, customized to epic proportions. With a camouflage finish and hydraulic wheels, this mega transport would be the envy of the Hebron sports teams who are stuck in the uncomfortable school buses given to them for long trips. With surround sound, mini bar, and shag carpeting, this Uber Bus would be the biggest and most impressive investment in my lifetime. Of course, the thing probably had a family of raccoons nesting in its defunct engine compartment, and it would probably be cheaper to just buy a brand new Benz instead of spending every waking hour of the day on this potential Pimpmobile. No matter what kind of future this treasure trove of a find would have been, my Mom just kept on speeding by, and I awaited my unknown Windex-involved doom at College Station. I guess I'll keep looking for a different hundred-dollar school bus elsewhere; I'm hoping to find another one of those Fundamentalist Baptist Church buses like we saw on the ride back, because the Holy Water tank in the back of the bus would be a great potential hottub in the renovation...

      Apparently I had to wake up at 10 in the morning today. The guys delivering the door for the media room are schedualed to arrive "sometime this day" and we needed someone to let them in. We've yet to teach Gladys to open the door, let alone to wear the little French maid's outfit, so the job was cast upon while my parents hid behind the excuses of hair salon appointments and "work." Had I known this would have been a battle of excuses, I would have thought of a good one at 3 earlier in the morning...  As I recall, Colter visited the house last Friday. We ate pizza, and played Halo and Battlefield Vietnam. Yeah, that's pretty much the entire summary of the entire day.  School starts the tweflth, and I still haven't finished Huston smith's  The Illustrated World's Religions  yet. If the long-drawn introduction that repeats the phrase "This book is/is not about..." disheartens your spirits, wait until you try stomaching both Hinduism and Buddhism one after the other. To be honest, I'm looking forward to the good old-fashioned ass kicking that's often associated with Islam and Christianity, instead of this senseless "peace of mind" drivel the other religions push on you.  Tomorrow I have to journey all the way down to College Station to help with Stephen's move to a new apartment. My usefulness is, yet again, limited to "accepting deliveries"; apparently, I've got to stay put at a single address, read the Text of Smith, and wait for some guys to ring the doorbell.   Sigh.
