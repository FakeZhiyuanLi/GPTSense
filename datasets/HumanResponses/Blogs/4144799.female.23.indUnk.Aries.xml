      Spring in Aedessa is nurturing. Everything and everyone finding a reason to live. I'm trying to find exactly that. This spring that our leader had been assassinated. We do not claim to be an idyllic world. For a hundred years war had ravaged our region. But we promised never again. No more blood. No more darkness.    "Nerissa."   "We can't leave." I can't, I thought. I don't know the answers yet.   "You can't, but we must. The elders, they know how to deal with war, but we who are not born into this don't."   "If all of us shall leave, who will take care of the village?"   "You can't fight."   Yes, I can't, but is it reason enough to escape? To leave my home, Ritthea, the fields, the creeks of which I can trace in the palm of my hand?   Lev was gazing at the stars, and perhaps could already see the worlds he would travel to get far enough.   "To leave is to live. Alive, we can go back. Fight after we learn how to."   I didn't reply. Already I felt that indeed I will go but I couldn't see myself returning.   His warm hand caught mine. "I know no place but Ritthea. The only reason I won't return is if I die."   Yes, he was right. Slowly we turned to descend one last time the sacred mountain of Aedessa where only a few months back Lev had lit my candle for the feast of Ellion Te. Light. Fire. May it burn still long after we leave.

      I saw her only once, when she walked barefooted across the park, rain pouring down. I tried to see her face but it was dark and the park was dimly lit, and with the rain everything she seemed to blend with everything else---the trees, the bridge, the wind, the grass. She was one with the night, standing there, arms raised, mouth drinking the raindrops. My skin tingled, how simple and beautiful to be free, to let go. Holding my camera, I wish to capture her and the moment. But the rain made it impossible, and our distance. I watched her in silence. I watched her...and longed to touch her. I stood there 'till after the rain turned to drizzle. She was gone. But, god, I never did again enjoyed the waste of those hours.

      Reikker stepped outside, his destination unsure. What was right? A cleansing of the impure or the survival of the vile? Must others die so he could live? Must anyone at all die? And he, what right had he to live? The hun blood? His swastika badge?  Suddenly he stopped. The cobbled street was covered white. Snow? In spring? On impulse he held out his palm and let some of the stuff settled. Not snow. Dust. He stopped before a car parked on the street and passed his hand across the hood. Yes, dust.  He walked again, but slower. The other people on the street noticed it too and were murmuring to each other. Then, like a thunder bolt, it struck him and a chill enveloped his heart.   Ash.  Ash rain.

      In my past lives I have been a gypsy, an aviator, a soldier, seeress, sower, teacher, jew, conspirator...They say the object of reincarnation is the chance to evolve into a better self, to achieve enlightenment--the nirvana. But the lives I've lived are clothes I wore, and wear them I did until I see myself fit into them and them into me...
