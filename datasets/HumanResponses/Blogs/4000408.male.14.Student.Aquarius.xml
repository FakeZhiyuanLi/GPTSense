        Haiz...today my flu still the same, worse as ever. Cough got better but the throat still feels sore and dry. This morning woke up went down to see the docter, it so happened to rain heavily and the weather was soooooooooooooooo cold. Anway the weird doctor didnt give me mc to skip physical trainings and said i should be ok...after tat she gave me a whole crap load of medcine including the one i love best! lozenges!   During the after noon i went to chat with sum friends on msn, then ask the !#$%^& hartanto give me my enigma, that shiet ass scammer! keep changing the deal and me wait a whole 20 mins for nothing! Bah anyway i didnt expect him to give it to me, that hartanto's words are never trustworthy. Haiz, i wish i could just watch the skies with friends everyday without worrying about a single thing on my mind...
