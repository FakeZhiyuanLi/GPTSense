      Ahh, how great yesterday was! Yesterday was my first day home after my whole entire lovely week of field hockey camp. Camp was great! I got schooled by all of the girls there sooo badly, cause they had all been playing for probably like a thousand years, but it was all good. I met some new people. I roomed with these two girls, Rachael and Katie. They were both awesome, and so sweet. I miss them now. I can't sleep now, becuase it feels weird to be sleeping in my own bed. How strange. At camp, the sessions were long and tiring, but they were really worth it. Everyday we would wake up at 7 am. and eat breakfast, than at 8:45, we would be out on the field and be ready to play. In the mornings, we would always go to different stations which we on the fields, which all had different kinds of techniques there. It was cool. We did a hell of a lot of sprinting there. It wasn't too bad though. Then at 11:30, the session would be over and everyone would flock to the lunch buffet. Then at 1:45, again we would have to be out on the field, but at these times we would play with our "teams". Well of course I didn't have a team, so I was with just a bunch of other random girls. It was all good though. We would then come off of the fields at 4:30, and then again go eat. At 6:45 we would all go on the field again and play games against each other until it got dark out, so that would be usually about 8:30 pm. It was a helluva busy day! Every night me and my girls were beat! It was a lot of fun though and it was worth it. Wednesday night was a ton of fun, becuase we had the talent show. We did American Idol and I got up in fron of a bunch of people and like sang "I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts." Everyone was laughing. Then on Tuesday night, we didn't go out at night again, becuase it was pouring so badly. So we all watched Finding Nemo. Everyday it did rain though, we did play in it, so on Tuesday in the afternoon and on Wednesday at night, we played in the pouring rain. I was completely soaked and uncomfortable. Our room reeked of wet clothing and mildew and mold and nasty crap like that! It was terrible. Next time I go to camp, I know now to bring a lot more stuff, like Gatorade and like snacks and stuff to do. All we did in our room was sat around and played cards, becuase that's all we had! It was still fun though. I bought this awesome sweatshirt from the store. I got it all muddy though on Thursday, the day I finally came home, because we had to play on the Rugby field, which was a total swamp, because of all of the rain! It was pretty funny though, everyone was sliding and falling. It's weird, it's my first night home and in my own bed, and I can't sleep at all. I thought the minute my head touched the pillow, I would be out like a lightbulb, but that was completely opposite. I can't get comfortable. Well, peace out!

      Man, I'm getting lucky with Matt. We went out three nights in a row! I would think he would be extremely sick of me by now. I mean I know I would be sick of myself. (i was going to say I would be sick of him...but that would be such a bad lie!) Well on SUnday night, Matt and I went to the diner, but the worst thing happened: Dave came a long! Dave was flirting with Matt all night long. It was just so wrong. I remember all those times Dave would tell me how evil Matt is and that I shouldn't go places with him. ANd now when he sees him again, Dave tells me how hott Matt looked and how Dave thought "Matt was flirting with me" quote by dave. MATT ISN'T GAY! He never will be either. I swear Dave gets these crazy thoughts in his head! We made this awesome drink. There were so many bad ingredients mixed together. For example, we mixed: jello, whip cream, sugar, tapioca pudding, cigarette ashes, salt, pepper, ice cubes, coffee, and water. It was really crazy. It tasted really good though. Me and Matt tried it. It was actually not too bad tasting. I thought I was probably gonna die because of the cigarette ashes and stuff. It was funny. Matt looked so cute tonight. He was wearing this "Dragonfly" shirt, which was sexy tighter and black. He looked good in it. We all watched Aqua Teen Hunger Force then when we went back to my house. It was pretty fun. I couldn't stop laughing. I noticed that Matt would look at me a lot and see if I was laughing or not. It almost seemed like he cared about me. Hehe. I had another great night with him. Peace out

      Today, i woke up this morning, and didn't do too much. I woke up this morning and just worked out. I did my wonderful leg workout. After working out all I did was go to Barnes and Nobles. I got my summer reading there. There were a lot of other things that I wanted to buy but I didn't get anything. I am too cheap to buy things. I wish I weren't always so cheap. I really want to find this one book that Matt and I were talking about before. It seemed really good, but I can't remember the name of it. This was a long time ago though. Tonight Dave may be coming over to watch some movies and stuff. I really wish that Matt and I would go out again tonight, but I highly highly doubt he will call me again tonight. I'm sure he is majorly sick of me. I had so much fun last night with Elissa and him. I'm so happy that Elissa was there, because I don't think I wouldn't have been able to kiss him. I would have probably been too embaressed. Or else it would have been really nice if it would have turned into like a make out session, or else if he just like stayed longer or something. I really enjoyed leaning against him, and having my leg on his. I wonder what he thought of it. I just can't believe i did kiss him. I'm happy I did it though. Well I'm going to be leaving now. Peace out, dogs.

      Man oh Man! Today was the craziest day I have ever lived. Well last night, I went out to a diner with Matt. I had the best time ever. It was so much fun. We were both like ranting and raving about the greatness of Family Guy and Adult Swim. We always talk about a lot of weird things. But that's what makes it great. Him and I get along so perfectly. I really am in love with that boy. We are like perfect for each other, or so it seems. We both love anime, toons, music, video games, and a helluva lot more! Last night we did pretty much flirting, I guess. He told me he remembered when Crystal and I were handcuffed together. He told me that was really hott, all I did was giggle. I didn't know what to say. I should have said I wish that I were hand cuffed to you..but instead I had to comment and say that i wished they were fuzzy and pink instead of fuzzy and black. Oh well, either way it was still hillarious. Then after the diner, we came back to my house and chilled in my basement. It was funny, because we were watching cartoons off of newgrounds. They were so funny. There was one he showed me called "there she is!" and it so reminded me of myself, becuase the main character was a bunny, who was in love with this cat, and she like stalked him and flirted with him so much, and finally one day they came together and got married. I swear, Matt was trying to show me a sign or something. He was saying how cool it was, and when I saw it, it just reminded me of me, and it was a weird coincident that the main character was a bunny. It was so adorable though. I really should have made a move that night, but I was too chicken. He knows I like him, because I told him, but i dunno if he likes me back or not. I guess I'll just have to wait and see. This morning I woke up like usual and worked out on our lovely gym. Boy, that felt sooo nice! I haven't worked out yet since I got home from field hockey camp, and now I finally got to, so it was awesome. Then at 12:30, I went to the amazing Harry Potter birthday party, which was at Emily's Aunts house. Mike, Elissa's boyfriend, Elissa, Eli, Beam, Kimmy, and myself were there, along with some of Beam's family. We had the best time. We were all eating these Harry Potter jelly beans, which were so addicting, but so horrible tasting! Some of the worst flavors were vomit, earwax, dirt, grass, boogers, sardines, and grape jam. They were all so bad, but they were hillarious tasting them all. It was so cool seeing how everyone reacted to the different beans. Hahah. I couldn't even swollow sardines or vomit. I had to spit them out. Next after that, we played an awesome game of Quidditch. It was really fun. We just had balls and stuff and ran around throwing them to each other and trying to get them through hanging hullahops. Then after that we painted our wands and stuff. Mine was so funny looking. It had dots on it and stripes, kind of like a candy cane and a lady bug mixed. I painted mine red and silver. Elissa's was so awesome looking. She said it was the pimp wand. Her and I talked about Matt so much, it wasn't even funny. Actually, it was though, because she kept commenting about his "rhinestones" and how he likes to sit in diners and smoke up and eat toast. Haha. I love that girl. We had some really good moments today. We were talking about so many different things. We were laughing histarically about the time Elissa was in Las Vegas, and the old woman fell while running to the elevator, and her arm got caught in the door and stuff. That was the most funny story i have heard in a long long time! Then after painting, we played Escape from Azkaban, which was a game where we talked each other to prevent the person from getting to a tree, which was the winning point. It was a lot of fun. Itwas hard though becuase I had to play in a skirt. That was allright though. I didn't mind too much. After that we opened and exchanged out Harry Potter gifts and stuff. It was awesome. I got this really neat game. I liked it. After the party, which ended at like 6, Elissa and I went back to her house and went online. For a long time she was talking to Matt. Then after that, we went to her Uncle Vince's house to eat something, and we had this long talk about what I should do with Matt. Like I told her how much I really liked him and stuff. She kept hinting things about me when she talked to him online. I think he was getting annoyed, but he didn't know I was really there and was reading the conversations. Bwahaha! That's good that he didn't know I was there though. It's funny how differently he talks to her and then how he talks to me. She's just so crazy with him. She'll just like say/ask the craziest things, and I always like have to plan out everything that I am going to say. I love her. Shes my best friend for sure. Then, i went home at about 8:30, and I went online and talked with both Ellie and Matt. Then I told Matt that I was in the mood to makeout and he said that he was too. And that's when he was like "Hey, let's go to a diner." Elissa came with too. We had the bestest time ever. I got to sit in the front with Matt and then also I sat next to him in the booth. My leg never left his. I couldn't stop shaking my legs. Apparently, we both have that problem. Hehe. Before I remember he told me that if we both were shaking our legs, it meant that we both wanted to have sex. I could agree to that one! Heheh. I'm so bad sometimes. Well, anyways, while we were all at the Mount Penn diner, we talked about so many random things. After that we went back to my place and hung out in my basement and watched some cartoons on the laptop. ((I think Matt liked my skirt. I never wore a skirt when i was with him before, and this one was short and school girl-ish.)) I went to the bathroom, and Ellie did the craziest thing! She told him that she thought that him and I made a really good couple, like we looked good together. Then while watching the toons, I was leaning against him the whole time. It was nice. He probably hates me...OH WELL! If he does, then too bad! I can always find a better guy some other time. I just had to make some moves because I wanted to see how he would react. He didn't seem to mind, but i guess I'll never really know until next time I go out with him. Maybe he'll believe Elissa and ask me out, since we make such a good couple and we like hanging out together so much. Elissa is such a great friend, she compliments me so much. She told me how pretty I was and how sweet I am and stuff like that. She makes me feel like I really can get any guy I would want. She always tells me about all these guys that look at me and check me out and stuff. It's really nice and it really helps me to raise my confidence. Well, anyways. Then he was leaving and was going to take Elissa home, and I MADE A MOVE! FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER! hahah. It was so scary. Like he gave me the usual hug, but this time I wrapped my arms around his neck and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. It was really nice actually. I was so embarrased though...I like ran back inside cause my face turned BRIGHT red. Then I was standing inside the door as Elissa and him were leaving, and he like tripped over our gate. I believe he was probably so stunned that I actually kissed him. It was weird...i sort of judged my height wrong. I thought I was a lot shorted than him...so I like ended up kissing his ear/sideburn...I was so embaressed. I should just go die. Well, maybe he liked it. Well Elissa told me that on the car ride to her house he asked her "do you really think that we make a good couple?" and Elissa obviously was like "YEAH!" and stuff like that. So maybe he's just considering going out with me. He told Elissa earlier that day when she was online that he and I were just friends, but maybe that was a cover, or else maybe he changed his mind. I really liked going out with him two nights in a row. It was a lot of fun. It really seems like I never run out of things to talk about with him. It's great. I'm so scared to talk to him again though. I'm terrified about what he's going to say. Oh well. I'm just happy I actually made the moves. I have never done anything like that before in my life, so I'm happy I finally tried something new. And amazingly it felt really like it was the right thing to do. I hope he liked it. That would be great. I guess I'll have to wait and see. Well I'm going to go to bed now and dream about my crush. Atleast I hope I do. Well Buh-bye!
