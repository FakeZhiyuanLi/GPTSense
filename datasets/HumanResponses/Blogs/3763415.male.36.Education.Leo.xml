      For my first blog, I thought I'd do a quick thought I have about fatherhood.  It's my theory on how to be a good dad and it's based on being a high school teacher and seeing how 17 year olds differ because of their dads.  It's a simple philosophy: kids are like piggy banks.  While they are young and don't know any better (and actually like being with mom and dad) dad's need to deposit as much as they can time wise and emotionally.  My rule: every time they laugh, it's $1 in the bank.  Because every day, your child will withdraw funds from the piggy banks and as teens, the take a lot out.  The idea is to make sure there is always something in the bank.  It may seem simple, but I honestly believe that if you put in a ton of time up front, it will get you through those teenage years.

      I just posted a website where Planned Parenthood is selling a T-Shirt that says, "I had an abortion."&nbsp; Wow, there's something to be proud of.&nbsp; I think I'll sell the standard, "My mom got an abortion and all I got was my brain vacuumed down a sink."&nbsp;   Has Planned Parenthood gone off the deep end?&nbsp; On there website, teenwire.com, guess who that's for, they offer advice about sex.&nbsp; Here's how they end one article about sexual experience,  &nbsp;Whether you've been around the block a few times or you're just starting out down that road, there's no such thing as the "perfect" level of experience. Good   urlLink  sex    is about good communication â€” not about meaningless labels like "prude" and "slut." As Matthew says, "Do what you feel is right for you and your partner, regardless of what your peers might say."     &nbsp; Okay, where is the abstinence talk?&nbsp; Isn't that the perfect level of experience.&nbsp; Afterall, abstaining has a perfect record: 0% STDs, 0% pregnancies, 0% abortions.&nbsp;   Why are they allowed to turn our teenagers into sexual commodities?

      Over and over again, the Democrats keep insisting that our global leadership has faltered because of Bush and Iraq.&nbsp; They also insist, that they will work more closely with them (read, Germany and France since they're about the only non-Communist states against us . . . and the Islamofacist states).  So let's see what the globe's leadership has been: Rwanda Genocide (disaster), Kosovo (disaster when you consider it took almost a decade to act), Sudan (disaster), Middle East (disaster).&nbsp; At least its consistent.  So why would we want to work with an international community that has been wrong or slow so many times?&nbsp; Should the US side with partnership when the partner is wrong?&nbsp; Is it the fault of the US (read, George Bush) that he understands a very simple concept: to do nothing between a fight between good and evil is to serve evil?&nbsp; If he's so dumb, why is he the only one that gets it?

      The one issue that has troubled me the most lately is the idea of gay marriage.&nbsp; One part of me is fundamentally&nbsp;oppossed to it while the other part of me figurese, "who really cares?"&nbsp; In fact, the last time I wrote seriously about this is sided for gay marriage.&nbsp; I'm changing my mind.&nbsp;  &nbsp; There are two arguments I haven't heard in the debate that has done this.&nbsp; First, opponents of the Gay Marriage Amendment say it should be up to the states, not the federal government.&nbsp; Well, they're forgetting an important part of the Amendment process which is that after the Amendment passes Congress, it must be passed by 3/4ths of the  state  legislatures.&nbsp; Imagine that, honest debate within every state of the Union.&nbsp; In fact, the original intent of our Founding Fathers like James Madison was the have the Constitution as the document that represents  all  Americans, thus the phrase in the Constitution that caused a lot of controversy at the time, "We the People," not, "We the States." &nbsp; Second, maybe the long term affects of SSM would be detrimental.&nbsp; Let's look at two studies.&nbsp; The  urlLink first  shows how illegitamacy rates increase in places SSM are allowed.&nbsp; The  urlLink second  study shows how economic and social factors decline in homes without a father.&nbsp; Now, I know the first is a blog and the second is from a Catholic site which some may think are unscientific or unreliable places to site studies, but I'm willing to bet places like Harvard would find the same thing.&nbsp; Either way, if this is true, though there will always be excepts, by and large we would have to assume that if we allow SSM the illegitamacy rate in the US would increase which would increase poverty, crime, and illiteracy. &nbsp; Unless shown otherwise, I don't think I can support gay marriage anymore.

      No one wants war.  I wish with all my heart that Iraq never happened.  However, sometimes life falls to two choices: bad and worse.  In this case, it's always better to choose the bad decision.  The objective observer understands that threat that Saddam Hussein posed in the Middle East.  His  urlLink WMD  program did exist, he was a  urlLink terrorist , and he is  urlLink linked  to al-queada. I honestly don't see how with all this information, Bush could not have gone to war.  Especially after getting UN approval in the first place, and then their backing off.  But let's look at perspective: today, everyone agrees that World War II was justified, though it killed 10s of millions of people.  But was Hitler a threat to the US?  Did he attack us yet?  Granted, he did declare war on us, but didn't the terrorists also declare war on us?  Just as people say WWII was justified, I'm sure they would also say going in and knocking off Hitler when he was half the power in 1937 lets say, would have been a lot easier.  As I see it, getting Hussein now is about the same as knocking off Hitler in 1937, just as if we had waited, getting him 2008 let's say would be more difficult like WW2 was.  But in 2008, people would have a much clearer conscience.
