      Why is humanity so willing to allow our egos to drive us to be so unkind and vicious to one another?  How man can look in the mirror and feel entitled and justified to be brutal, I will never, ever understand.  We have collectively lost our sense of community and forsaken it for our need to be right, our need for more, our need to feel superior and strong...for what, I ask you each? So that children can see their fathers bleed on cable access television, so that our fuel prices will go down and lusts for revenge will be satisfied, so that stomachs and hearts will be pitted and gutted by pain?  To feel good while your hand strikes down another in bloody murder is something beyond my senses.  For god's sake, we are all each other's to keep safe!  I confess, I feel sickened by our world today.  My heart goes out to the families of the slain.  This is not OK.

      MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian intelligence services warned Washington several times that Saddam Hussein's regime planned terrorist attacks against the United States, President Vladimir Putin has said.  *NOTE TO SELF:  How long will it take GWB to say "uhhh, yeah, Putin...we got the intelligence from Putin...we told you so!" DESPITE the fact that there has not been ONE SINGLE MENTION of this to date, not to the public, not in hearings, zip.

      So, I'm over at Gary & LPs house last night and, not unusually, the subject of politics, policies and Republicans came up.  For those of you who aren't yet in the know, I truly, to the marrow of my bones, hate George W. Bush, his administration and his joke of a presidency.  I also think most Republicans have their heads straight up their ass.  If this offends you, cope, I said most.  Both Gary and LP made excellent points.  Gary's point:  Welfare mothers are damned if they do and damned if they don't.  Think about it, the anti-abortion circuit criminalizes single, pregnant women who choose to terminate a pregnancy, rather than give birth to the baby.  It's murder, right?  Well then these farktards turn around and criminalize single mothers for needing public assistance because the moms so dared to have the child.  What's worse, they do everything in their power to un-empower her by trying to crush the modicum of benefits she may still have left.  Unreal.   Now before you pile on the crap, I'm not talking about these crazy women who bilk the system by pumping out kids at breakneck paces to support crack habits, I'm talking about regular women (I know a few), who got pregnant and need legitimate help to stay above water.  And the first person to suggest she gives up the baby for adoption gets beat on the head with a pig bladder.  Of course, a woman has a right to give up her child for adoption, not in dispute in the slightest, but to suggest a woman HAS TO, in lieu of going on public assistance, is hideous.  Overall, I admit, Gary has a pretty damn good point.  These jackasses win their argument no matter what the woman opts to do.  Oh and hey, let's take away her abortion rights altogether and then fuck her over when she HAS to have the kid.  Good times.  Onward to LPs point.  Welfare Mothers vs. 'Welfare Fathers' (I'm working on hard data to back this up, bear with me).  So we have all the Republican'ts complaining about these single, welfare mothers eating up goobermint tax dollars and resources and how dare they and shame, shame, shame.  Sinners deserve what they get, blah, blah, blah.  OK, then by that SAME argument, let's explore the rich, white men/CEO principle, shall we?    Huge corporations, run by CEOs making $40 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, move their 'headquarters' to Bermuda (read: shack with a phone) and create their lovely little tax shelter.  They hunt down and exploit tax loopholes, like the one about their private jet.  I'll use LP's example.  Let's say it costs a private jet $9,000 to fly from LAX to LaGuardia.  Thanks to the tax code, the company can write off almost 100% of the cost, making it CHEAPER to take a luxury private jet to LaGuardia than fly coach.  Sound fair?    So the theory is, and this is what we want the hard data for, for all the bitching the Republican'ts do about welfare mothers, they, in fact, are way bigger marauders and pillagers of the American tax stockpile, to the tune of BILLIONS.  For all their bullshit finger pointing, if they would just stop being unethical weasels, we wouldn't have to worry about shit like, can single mom have a piece of chicken for her kid?  Think about it, are they not ALSO using public assistance?  YOU AND I PAY TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR NON-CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY POT!  Alas folks, the next time you hear some asshole bitching about abortion, ask them if they are willing to foot the bill to help the woman raise the kid, and if they're not willing to, suggest that they ask their CEO to pitch in, he's out picking the sand from his asscrack.  What a world, people...what a world.

Out of respect for your rights not to have your e-mail inboxes deluged with my rapid-fire political rants, useless attachments or fun photo-shopped images of whomever, I have opted to start this here blog.  Lettuce start by saying I have no fucking idea how this thing is going to work.

      You guys, please, please, please go to this link and follow the HR Campaign's instructions to send a letter to your Reps.  Capital Hill is voting in three weeks on the Gay Marriage issue and we have got to take a stand against this 'legal' and rationalized legislation that does nothing but discriminate against our GLBT friends.  A bunch of pricks are using this lame-ass amendment to further the GOP agenda, which is nothing more than a tactical maneover to get GWB another term in office.  I swear, if that happens, I'm moving to Canada.  I beg and urge you to write.  This is critical.  If these fuckers want to make a big deal about it, then let's get ready to rumble.  This is bullshit!   urlLink Take Action: Tell your Senators to Oppose the Discriminatory Federal Marriage Amendment

      Last year, an old pal and neighbor of mine, John, lost his battle with AIDS.  It was very sad because he never divulged his secret to me, despite regular e-mails, and I had to find out how sick he was through my NYC superintendent. I never got a chance to help him or talk with him about his fears and hopes.  I hate knowing that someone I cared about had to die in such an awful, awful manner.  He was surrounded by friends and family in the end but still, I wish I could have done somehting more.  I will have a place for him inside this husk of a human being for always.  Here's the dilemma:  I still have his name and e-mail address in my computer's e-mail address book.  I kinda don't want to delete it, not for any raison-morbid, just because it's a daily reminder of him and, in a way, if I delete his name and contact info, I feel like I'm going to somehow delete him from the universe of ever having been.  Every time I see his name, I feel really sad, but maybe, that's good.  We should remember our lost and remind ourselves to fight for those who aren't able to fight for themselves anymore.    John Aaron DiLuzio is his name.  Rest ye merry gentleman.

      A new blogger buddy of mine and I were just having a conversation about the death penalty...my position on which I haven't considered with any depth in a long time.  I think it's a topic worth readdressing with yourself on occasion.  Here's what I said (Blogger Buddy is anti-death penalty, by the way):  I TOTALLY hear and respect what you're saying and I've struggled with this for a long, long time.  The system is flawed and so are people and most of the time, I can separate logic and reason from what's in the guts; however, I have a really hard time letting live someone who rapes and murders kids, child abusers and torturers...and now that DNA evidence is gaining respect for the accuracy of the technology, we know for as close to 100%, without having been there ourselves, as we're likely ever going to get.  With strong DNA evidence, I'd be the one flipping the switch on a child killer, I have to tell you.  These people corrupt the spirit of our society, their cruelty divides culture and there is strong, strong evidence to suggest that their minds are irreparably damaged and no manner of money will afford correcting their broken nature.  So then are we to be charged with keeping this filth, this tainter of spirits alive for the duration, affording him medical care that we won't even provide to our weakened grandmothers?  There's something wrong there.  The system is wrong, yes, but the system will always be wrong, lest we live in a complete police state where every move of every citizen is monitored.  Life is indeed the most precious thing we've been afforded and a terrible crime has been committed anytime an innocent is taken unjustly yet, we send people to their death everyday...good, honor-bound people...policemen, firemen, soldiers...we sacrifice them for the greater good and it is never a beautiful story to tell when one falls, but somehow I wonder if I could tolerate a lamb mistakenly stepping in for the wolf if we catch more wolves and tend to the entire flock making the whole safer.

      Has anyone else noticed how 'cooperative'Crowned Prince Abdullah from Saudi Arabia has been lately?  He's offering amnesty to all terrorists who turn themselves in, they just got a 'tip' about a 'main' Al Quaeda ideologue who supposedly spearheaded the Al Quaeda idiology around the middle east and subsequently died in a shootout yesterday, another guy turned himself in.    I'm voting something fishy is going on.  Now, I'm marginally prone to conspiracy theories, but looking around, I'm thinking that Bush is making some private calls to Prince A. and saying 'dude, I'm getting my ass kicked over here, you gotta cough up a couple of big tickets cuz if I lose this election, both our asses are screwed.'

      These dirty, dirty fuckers.  Let's recap the time-table on this one.  Elections, 2000, Florida:  --Florida does not let felons vote. --Florida produced a list of felons that had THOUSANDS of names entered incorrectly, thus barring legitimate voters from voting.  Many, if not most, of these voters were black, traditionally Democratic leaning. ---Bush won the state of Florida with 537 votes.  Yeah, that's right...FIVE HUNDRED AND THRITY SEVEN VOTES. --Goobernor Jeb does nothing. --Florida board of elections does nothing. --Court system does nothing. --House reps from all over the state petition the senate for an investigation. --House reps, every, single, one gets FUCKED because NOT ONE SENATOR signs their petition (despite thousands of signatures from citizens). --Bush steals the election. --Huge controversy that goes NOWHERE ensues.   Florida, 2001  --A statute gets passed by the REPUBLICAN-riddled Florida State Legislature that these 'Felon Lists' can only be viewed, not copied, thus limiting the public's ability to review the list. *huh, why the hell do you think they wanted to do that?*  Florida, 2004  --The court system has found this statute unconstitutional: "Whether the public chooses to inspect or copy [the list] is not the choice of the governmental agency which has custody of the record. It is the choice of the person who has requested access." --State has 48 hours to appeal, if they want. --List contains over 47,763 names.  You know..."You fool me once.....shame...shame on you, You fool me twice....well, you can't get fooled again."  GWB  I hate these motherfucking PIGS!!!!!!!

      You know, I can't speak for everyone else on the topic.  On the one hand, I think it's pretty funny that Dick *heart-attack* Cheney is so at the end of his rope that he's willing to tell Pat Leahy (D-VT) to go 'fuck himself.'  Leahy, yeah, that guy, the nice one, the peacemaker.  Seems Leahy touched another nerve when questioning Cheney about Haliburton and his ties to the hugely scandalous company.  The fact that an 'effenheimer' was tossed on the senate floor is hugely entertaining...and yet, disturbing.  First of all, had the Senate actually been officially in session, Cheney would be in deep, deep shit.  You're just not allowed to behave like a clown when you're "representin.'"  Second comes the fact that the asshole actually admitted to 'feeling better' saying Leahy 'had it coming' and that 'many of my colleagues would agree he had it coming.'  Yeeeeeahhhhhh, because if anyone told you to go fuck yourself, I'm SURE you'd let them get away with it.  Not only are you an elected official, you're SECOND IN COMMAND in the big office and the guy in charge of the Senate. It may behoove you to maintain SOME standards of conduct while in the chamber, n'est pas?  I say fuck all the time, but I'm also an asshole marketing manager for a bullshit company that thinks riding a tandem bike with Jesus is how to get your jollies...but I digress.  This bully, this fuck-face, this caller of names and slinger of expletives is our Vice President people...man, if you can't handle your shit, you best roll-over and let someone in there who can.  You don't have to like and respect everyone you work with, fuck if I do, but it is NOT cool to tell people to go fuck themselves in their place of business, especially when that business is running our country.

      Hey Kreeps,  I know everyone is asking you for money, tis the season...from NPR to Greenpeace, our pockets are drying up.  Having said that (and having recently donated $160 smacks to MPR myself), I'd like to emplore you to consider donating to the Kerry campaign.  This is the last month he can accept donations, putting him at a full-month disadvantage from GWB, who's able to raise money through August (it's due to convention dates and shiite).  While I don't think we'll ever be able to catch up to Dubbs, we can minimize the shortfall if we pony-up now and do our best to get as much dough to him as possible.  These last four months are crucial and hopefully, GWB will keep farking himself in the ass, but in the event there's a plateau or he finds Bin Ladin (not that he's looking anymore, let's be honest), we need a cushin-for-the-pushin' and that's got to come from the you's and me's of the world.  Anyway, enough prattle, here's a link for a quick donate page.  Help us Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're our only hope....   urlLink :: John Kerry for President - Contribute ::

      If you believe that Bush was sold a bill of goods by the CIA and worked with that intelligence, oblivious, and waged war on Iraq, I want you to ask yourself one question:  What did George Tenet have to gain by spearheading the initiative to pick and choose certain information, skew other information and directly ignore still more information from smaller intelligence agencies (like the state department)?  Why would he do that?  Was there something personally at stake?  Was he just clumsy?  His actions seem pretty deliberate.  What was it that compelled him to seemingly seek out any and information he could find related to Iraq and WMDs?  Ask yourself that...and then let's compare notes cuz I have a pretty damn good idea why.  What if someone was up his ass to provide backup for war?  I'll give you three guesses.

The original sloganator accepted everything, then started censoring profanity and words like "hitler," "dictator," and "evil." Nevertheless, some clever liberals exploited the sloganator to their (our) own ends -- before its demise only a couple of weeks after its birth.  its mourners assembled some of the best for the slide show.   behold . . . the sloganator!

      Boy, do I have a few, big things to say about this...I'll try and keep it short and sweet.  Essentially this says the CIA royally fucked up and gave GWB and his insane clown posse really, really bad info, which is ENTIRELY true.  But watch how everyone is going to react to this..I'm envisioning a whole lot of 'see, see, it wasn't our fault.'  Personally, I think that's the equivalent of the Titanic's captain trying to blame the tragedy on the iceberg...not gonna cut it.  When you hear these cries of innocence, especially from voters, keep a solid few things in mind.  1)  GWB is the big boss of the CIA, the one ultimately responsible for its conclusions, decisions and information.  Did George Tenent fuck up? You bet your ass he did!  Did GWB a) do anything about it?  b) even review all of the information being presented or did he, by-and-large, just listen as people told him what to do? c) take ANY responsibility for any of this or is he just going to continue to 'stay the course' even though the 'course' has just been proven wrong?  2)  The other thing to keep in mind that these findings are based on JUST the work of the CIA, NOT what the Whitehouse did with the info or to what degree they are responsible.  In short, it does not take GWB off the hook for anything, it's only 1/2 the story.  The rest is to come later, after the election.  Which I'm about to respond to.  So, we get half the story today and half will come after the elections, thanks to BOTH Democrats and Republicans.....Excuse me, WHAT?  And I'll take Big Bill's argument on this one (thanks Bill)....We are supposed to vote on who we think could do a better job, right?  GWB has based his ENTIRE campaign on this 'War on Terror' yet we will not know how bad a job he did until AFTER the elections?  ARE YOU FUCKING OUT OF YOUR GODDAMNED MINDS?  This could ice the cake on how fucking bad a POTUS he is and voters won't hear the truth until it is all said and done?  What an AMAZING amount of bullshit people....I think we need to write our reps again, which you can do if you go here:  http://mygov.governmentguide.com/mygov/officials/congress/?azip=55412  Seriously you guys, EVERY DAY they are pulling some slick-ass shit to obfuscate (see my word of the day post ;-) the truth...and that truth is simply that this is the worst leadership our country has ever seen and it's happening on our watch.  If he wins this election, we are in an unsurmountable pile of deep, deep shit.  Write your reps guys, we don't have to take this shit.  I mean, look at the bottom line:  President Bush is NOT doing a very good job at his basic function as POTUS, and that basic function is to protect us.

      Here we go again, the following excerpts speak for themselves:  --Ridge cited "recent interdictions" for the new warning. He said  U.S. officials have no precise knowledge of the time, place or method of attack , but said they are "actively working to gain that knowledge."  --Senate Majority Leader  Bill Frist , R-Tennessee, speaking before the briefing,  said the intelligence was "very non-specific" and there was "no reason for panic, no reason for paralysis ."  Ummmm, yeah...Let's scare the American people into submission....again.  WTF?  'You're gonna get your ass kicked, but we have no idea when or how or where you'll be.'  Great.  Oh 'But we're doing everything we can to justify your having just shit your pants'  I hate these guys, I really, really hate them.  PS, my new blogger pal, Steve, made an interesting notation:  Coincidence that this new terror threat alert comes on the heals of Kerry announcing Edwards, which spiked the polls in their favor?  Me thinks no.  urlLink CNN.com - Ridge says al Qaeda planning attack - Jul 8, 2004

      The vote is right around the corner....no time to waste people, call and write your reps!  Contact information and a way to write everyone at the same time is here:  urlLink Government Guide   The following letter went to Dayton, Coleman, Sabo and GWB:  It's my civil duty to inform you that I will NOT support any legislator, representative, or federal or community leader of any kind who is even ENTERTAINING the idea that this is not an absolute, concrete affront to the civil rights of ALL citizens.  First gay men and women and then what? Blacks? Jews?   Take the bible out of our politics and look what you get...peculiar right? Apples and Apples.    GLBTs deserve the same civil liberties afforded to their straight friends and we straight friends have a moral obligation to stand up for those voices that are clearly not being heard loud enough.  No rational man, no man of honor and dignity would vote for this ban.  It's sick and I won't tolerate my leaders supporting it.  I will withdraw votes, financial support and I will speak to everyone I know about your decision.  I'd love to apologize for appearing gruff, but that is what this proposed legislation and the foolish makers of law have led me to.    Thank you for your time.

      I'll address this quickly, since it's 100 o'clock.  I am a flaming liberal, there's no question about that; however, I do have a few beefs about this bi-partisan system and some 'Democrat' shit.  I ask you, why does it cost so much to rig...errrr, I mean, run an election?  I mean seriously, check out the numbers.  --Kerry raised $148,500,000+ --GWB raised $214,780,000+  You guys, that's a total of $363,280,000+ (I mentioned the +PLUS, right?) alone!  Yeah, not even including what the other guys paid to run.    I'm tired, so all I'm really go to say on this whole thing is WE ARE BEING BOUGHT...and the difference between Repubs and Dems is NOT as big as you might think...sure, there are hot-bed issues like Gay Marriage Ban and crap like that, but when you look at all these guys, they're all buying deals and buying votes and no really great candidate without $$ will ever stand a chance because you cannot win these elections without paying a cubic arseload of cash for ads, planes, hotel costs, security, entourages and very, very expensive suits...  Man, all that money and the best we're going to get is Kerry and Edwards....don't get me wrong, I'm hopeful for that too, given our options, but shit guys, our options suck pretty hard and low.  As we rah-rah our boys to win, keep in mind that this system is not without huge, huge flaws.  $363,280000+  The things we could do.....   urlLink CNN.com - Presidential race shapes up as millionaires vs. millionaires - Jul 7, 2004

      ..first of all, is a great show, but that's not what this entry is about.  On occasion, my life becomes something of a traveling side-show, I mean,  Lobster-Boy , side-show.  Nick and I are goobs. Really, we know this, we don't need your pity.  Usually on Tuesdays, sometimes Sundays and an occasional Friday or two, we go to a certain pub in a certain part of town to play  National Trivia Network .  For those not in the 'know,' NTN is *shock,gasp,wheeze* a national network for trivia junkies and amateurs who compete individually in their own pub against other pubbers, and nationally, both as individuals and by establishment.  I think our pub made the top ten once.  Anyway, there are a LOT of smart fuckers who play, especially on Tuesdays, when all the brains show up and you have to struggle your ass not to be last (unless you're Nick, who is very deservedly in the top 3, often in first place on Tuesdays).  However, on Fridays, it's more brain-friendly and casual and you get your rudimentary types...normally.    There is one regular player who usually comes in Friday's but does an occasional off-night stint and sometimes we're all in the same place at the same time.  Her name is Jenny.  Jenny is a trivia whiz and has the highest ranking score(s) in the pub, by a long, long shot.  Jenny has thick, long, sort of strawberry, washed-out blonde hair with chunky blonde highlights throughout her bangs. She wears thick, thick makeup, has long, long nails, fake ones...she's also got fake boobs and a five-o'clock shadow.  Jenny is our transgendered friend.  Jenny is sweet.  Very, very sweet.  If you're like Nick and I, you don't care that the stubble is growing back on her arms or that her paper-route is a drag (pun not intended).  We don't care that she reads trashy romance novels at the bar, or that she repeats herself constantly about the woes of parking costs and delivering papers and drunk Jim always wanting a ride home.  Nope, we happily accept Jenny...even after I drunkenly gave 'her' my cell number, which she has been using with great aptitude.  Jenny generally calls when she's at the bar playing, usually asking if we are coming down.  I typically get the voicemail and sometimes call her back, sometimes not and sometimes, I even call her to let her know we're there when she's not, to return the courtesy.  I say that mostly because I don't want to appear like an asshole.  Something happened to me today at work that I'm unsettled about.  Not in a 'They're coming to get you Barbara' kind of way, but in the kind of way you used to feel when you found out someone had a crush on you and you didn't like them back...the "Oh fuck, now what am I supposed to do?" feeling.  Yeah, Jenny called me on my cell, during working hours, to just "chat."  I didn't answer, but when I got the message I had a pang in my stomach, the kind of pang that tells you you are going to have to be fuck to someone you find harmless and you are going to feel like hell for it for a good, long time.  Jenny thinks we're 'friends.'  At what point during the initial stages of a relationship do you cross over that 'friendly acquaintance' mode and delve into the abyss of friendship?  Aren't you giving off cues to this possible partner in crime that you are a willing participant and aren't you, yourself interpreting these moves to make sure no boundaries are being crossed...either too soon or at all?  Now granted, I'm a pretty fucking friendly fucker and I don't give a rat's about most stuff, the insignificant.  I'll talk to you, even if you don't have many teeth, that's just how I am.  My mother yells at me, telling me I'm 'too nice,' which is a stitch considering where I garnered the behavior from.  I can lovingly say, there's not a grocery store or bank line safe from her friendly chatter.  And while she'll bemoan the weak and downtrodden and stranded, I have personally been in the car with her when she picked up a little old lady who missed her bus and had no idea how to get home.  Through gritted teeth and a warm smile, mom drove around tirelessly till we got the little old lady who lived in a shoe, safely back to her apartment....because it was Christmas.  Anyway, where was I? OK, friendly.  Yes, I am and I do think there's a line between being accepting and friendly and being too much so as to give people the wrong idea.  For example, based on our current relationship, I wouldn't have considered moving Jenny's couch or inviting her over for dinner, or to a pajama party, and I wouldn't call her up just to 'chat.'  So how did this get all on its ear?  I think lonely people have a different meter than those of us who have tons of cool people in our lives with tons of cool things to do and a soft place to snuggle in to at night...we're just not (dare I say?)...desperate.  And so, somehow the desperate reach and cling and try to crawl in your lap and you're left holding the bag of assholes because really, what do you feel like?  A BIG BAG OF ASSHOLES.    Is it mean to feel trapped by these folks?  Are we justified?  Is our sense of right and wrong falsely triggered by the notion that this is somehow our fault?  Or is it their fault, their fault for not getting the right message?  Who am I supposed to irritated with?  Myself, Jenny, this weird world?  And, more importantly, what do I, you and the rest of us do about it?  Any which way you slice it, I'm screwed.  I either have to be an asshole or suck-it-up and play hurt.  Man, dese are dah breaks.  Discuss...

      Some how "I told you so" doesn't feel as good as I would have thought.  Sons and daughters are still dying in this unjustified war and the Commision is calling 'bullshit' on Cheney & Company.  The question now becomes, WHY AREN'T THESE FUCKERS BEING TRIED FOR TREASON?  They lied and hundreds of our own are dead...some mutilated, burned and hanging from bridges, some sodomized and decapitated...and remember, this was all going on while precious Jenna was out getting drunk and falling over on the sidewalk.

      I think it's interesting that many right-leaners are whining about Edwards lack of public service (read: experience).  OK, maybe he hasn't been inside politics for ever but I have two things to say:  1)  The Republicans had NO problem supporting and trying to elect GWB, despite the fact that he ran every business, including the state of Texas, into the ground before become president;   and  2)  Personally, I think not having been through the Washington Wringer is a GOOD THING.  Jesus, Kerry has been through enough to be a mentor and we'll get an entirely fresh balance from someone who worked his ass off his whole life to get where he is.  Yah, that sucks.  And if Kerry blows up day 2 and Edwards steps up as POTUS, I will be happy, because at least the fucker has morals and a desire to help people, unlike some jackass leaders I know.  Honestly, would you rather have Cheney or Edwards on your team?  Please....

      I just posted this as a response to a friend's blog that included a pro/con list used as a means to make a sizeable decision.  Poor guy wasn't asking for my two-cents, but I gave it to him anyway.  __________________________________________________________ I will make mention of a life lesson I learned regarding pro/con lists. Read on if you are interested.  Pro/Con lists don't work, ever. Why? Beacuse you are comparing subjective apples to subjective oranges. The way I combat this problem when making a big decision is by using my now famous "worst-case scenario" method.  For example, I had to decide if I was going to stay in NYC or move to Minneapolis. I had a kickass apartment that I bought not that long before (couple years), a well-paying job, amazing friends in town, my mom was nearby and NYC was a mine-field of opportunity and experience...but I was miserable, I felt trapped in a job I hated, I felt trapped on the island, going to grocery store 2 blocks away took an hour to deal with, too many people, I lived a block between a police station and a hospital, sirens all the time...UGH.   In Minneapolis I had my best friend, my kickass brother and his fiance', quiet, two cities to find cool stuff to do, I could have a car, the sky was HUGE, every season but winter was beautiful...but, it was MN. Winters are brutal, I had no job security, unfamiliar town where I knew two people, had no idea where to live or how to deal with living in a non-island city...how would I ever find my way around...everything was terribly unknown.  There's no way to make that decision. Apples and oranges, right? Enter the 'Worst-case Scenario' method.  What's the worst that could happen?  I stay in NYC and I continue to be a miserable fuck, be totally depressed, feel trapped and over-exposed to everything, feel overworked and underappreciated and generally just hate life...  OR  I could go to Minneapolis, check it out and if I hate it...I can LEAVE.  I picked the lesser of evils.  Whatever worst-case scenario is more painful, do the other thing.  You'll keep perspective and your options will seem SO much more clear.  Done. Deal. I rented out my apartment, refinanced with a 3/1 arm to give me enough time in Minneapolis to figure out what I was doing...wound up getting a shitload of rent for it, which funded the mortgage of my brand-new, 1,400sq. foot townhouse, built to my specs, on the wetlands where I had jackrabbits and pheasants in my backyard, sky as far as the eye could see and the most beautiful blue in the world. I lived halfway between my brother and best friend, my old boss kept me on, despite my remote location, I worked from home, bought a BMW from a friend and I've been here ever since...Now I own a house in Minneapolis and am soon-to-be married in October.  Worst-Case Scenario :)

      From my friend Skip, a personal request:  Bush would claim that the Presidential Election is in danger.   He would have Americans stay home instead of risking life and limb by commuting to the poling booths.   I agree.&nbsp; As soon as possible I would urge every American to submit their Absentee Ballot through the mail.&nbsp; Nobody need risk their life to vote if everybody votes absentee.

      ...but really, why look to the bright side when you can wallow in personal misery.&nbsp; I give you a list of things wrong in my life today...maybe I'll be in a better mood later. &nbsp;   Just found out Mom's cat Elvis died this week.&nbsp; He was a big, cool, old meatloaf that came to us many, many years ago.&nbsp; There was not an evil bone in his body.&nbsp; Anyway, he wasn't doing well, but no vet could figure out what was wrong.&nbsp; He got so limp, he couldn't even hold his head up.&nbsp; Mom consoled him for the duration, until he wanted off&nbsp;her lap.&nbsp;Hey lay down on the floor and&nbsp;she let him sleep for awhile. When she returned, he was nowhere to be found...just gone.&nbsp; After much arduous searching, she found him&nbsp;under a table and chairs where the poor kitty died alone...in the damp cool of the basement.&nbsp; I really liked Elvis.&nbsp; This sucks.  My insurance company has made mention that they are considering dropping me because I've filed two claims in the last 3 years.&nbsp; Uh sorry...the house is 72 years old, fuck off.  Ahhhhh, landscaping.&nbsp; Just got the final bid and the fence I want...really, really, really, really, REALLY want would cost me $5,000 and that doesn't include previous fence removal/disposal or staining.&nbsp; Come again?&nbsp; I'm not spending $5,000 on a fence.&nbsp; Now I need a plan B and I'm freaking out...cuz it's not like we don't need a fence, and it's not like we don't need a new car for Nick, or a stove, or a fridge, or the water damage in our house fixed in two places.&nbsp; FUCK!  I almost killed Nick and I last night by accidentally leaving my gas cap off when I pulled out of the station.&nbsp; Nick had lit a cig and some asshole driver in a goddamned Pontiac GrandAM, whom I had JUST chidded for driving like a retard, pulls up and says "hey, your gas cap is off, I thought I'd better tell you before you go Kaboom."&nbsp; I was grateful, but it's not about some pissant in a GrandAm pointing out the fact that I am my own biggest idiot.&nbsp; Then, to pour lemon-juice on the paper-cut, a car full of 19 year old gangster white boys pulled up and alerted me to the same thing..."Yeah, yeah kids, we know."&nbsp; Fortunately, the gas cap was still on the little hook or I would have had to shell out $45 for a new one, thanks to BMW being so inexpensive on parts.  I've been here since 6:50AM and am just flat-tired....and cranky...and hungry...which means I'm really cranky (just ask Nick).   I can't deal.&nbsp; I just wish I had some extra vacation time, but I'm hosed on that.&nbsp; I could use a break from this life right about now.&nbsp; Too much shit to do and not enough time or energy to do it.&nbsp; Man....  &nbsp;

      I am SEETHING.  Notonly is this an abomination (we are in a time of war AND THE RICHEST 1% of AMERICANS ARE GETTING TAX CUTS!), it is a huge slap in the fact to all Americans.  Read this article.  Highlights:  "But Republicans argue that the lowered deficit projection shows Bush has  made progress  toward his goal of halving the deficit in five years.  (ARE THEY FUCKING HIGH?  Are they saying this because the deficit is less than what their offices predicted for the year?  Ummmm, is it al ALL possible that they overprojected so they could look cool when this horrible number came out?"  OMG, OMG, OMG!)  They also say the recession in 2001, the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have unavoidably increased spending.  (RIGHT!  SO WHY ARE WE GIVING TAX CUTS TO THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND ALLOWING CORPORATIONS THEIR TAX SHELTERS IN THE CAYMANS!!!!!!!! FUCK!)  A stronger economy has lifted tax revenues in recent months and contributed to the downward revision in the budget gap. However, costs for the Iraq war have been higher than expected.  (YES!)  Lawmakers this month approved an extra $25 billion request for the 2005 fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 but the Pentagon has said it may need to dip into that money before the end of the current year. Bush is expected to ask for a larger sum when the election is over.   (He doesn't fucking quit...but he's still proposing TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH AND LOOPHOLES FOR CORP AMERICA...these people are SHIRKING THEIR SHARE!)  The White House missed its July 15 deadline for releasing the report. The budget update comes as the Bush campaign works to refine a second-term economic agenda for the president to roll out in coming weeks. "  (...and they can't get their work done ontime).  I hate them....I hate them so much.    urlLink White House forecasts record budget deficit - Jul. 30, 2004

Second, we cannot maintain our historic self-confidence as a people if we generate public panic.

        My car....my car has been making horrible noises for months, it was due for an oil change and the window was acting funny...and yeah, I probably should have had my snows taken off in June, but it's Minnesota, it could happen.&nbsp; So, Nick gets up at the crack of ass to drive to the car shop with me and take me to work, sweetheart that he is, at 6:45AM.&nbsp; PS, it's 5:10PM and I JUST got the info on what's going on.&nbsp; In addition to not even touching the car yet today the charges will be as follows:    Power stearing lines&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $195.60  Ball Joint repair&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $126.35  Broken window fix&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $298.16  Oil Change + swap tires&nbsp; $77.00    The total for this?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$697.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The kicker?????&nbsp; This does not include fixing the bend in my alloy rim, which will add another $225 to this monsterous charge, bringing the final total to $922.11  Did I mention that Nick's car's breaks are going and he has to take HIS car to the shop tomorrow.  Did I mention we have a wedding, a honeymoon and an ENTIRE backyard fix to pay for, not to mention finishing renovating the NYC apartment kitchen, or fixing the $3500 in water damage to the FIRST plaster incident (who's counting the second and third, at this point).  OH, and I got the hairy eye ball for turning in a preported piece of shit today, despite having worked on it for DAYS...Came in an hour and half early today just to make it pretty...nope, no good.  Let's see, oh yah, need to bum rides to and fro for two days cuz the car won't be fixed until Wednesday.  I have to get wedding invites out...  What else?&nbsp; Maybe I'll just do a part two tomorrow, my ride is coming to get me, bless her heart!  FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!KK!

        Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.    &nbsp;   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   &nbsp;   A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.    &nbsp;   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinton.     The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in&nbsp;speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.     If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.     A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies,&nbsp;then demand their cooperation and money.     &nbsp;Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health&nbsp;care to all Americans is socialism.     &nbsp;HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at&nbsp;heart.     &nbsp;Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but&nbsp;&nbsp;creationism should be taught in schools.     &nbsp;A president lying about an extramarital affair is a impeachable offense.     &nbsp;A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die&nbsp;is solid defense policy.     Government should limit itself to the powers named in the&nbsp;Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the&nbsp;Internet..     &nbsp;The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but&nbsp;George Bush's driving record is none of our business.     Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a&nbsp;conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for&nbsp;your recovery.     You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can&nbsp;tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.     What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but&nbsp;what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.     Feel free to pass this on. If you don't send it to at least 10 other&nbsp;people, we're likely to be stuck with Bush for 4 more years.   &nbsp;    Friends don't let friends vote Republican.

      I'm going to take this opportunity to thank the readers of this blog for their kind attention and the universe for serving as the garage for the Buick that is my brain sometimes. In honor of my 100th blog entry, I would like to leave you with this. I stole it from Rob, who got it from his mom, who found it....anyway, here it is. Read it, chew it, savor it and let it sit in your belly and mind for always:  any small, calm thing  Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good. What is needed for dramatic change is an accumulation of acts, adding, adding to, adding more, continuing. We know that it does not take "everyone on Earth" to bring justice and peace, but only a small, determined group who will not give up during the first, second, or hundredth gale.  One of the most calming and powerful actions you can do to intervene in a stormy world is to stand up and show your soul. Soul on deck shines like gold in dark times. The light of the soul throws sparks, can send up flares, builds signal fires, causes proper matters to catch fire. To display the lantern of soul in shadowy times like these - to be fierce and to show mercy toward others, both, are acts of immense bravery and greatest necessity. Struggling souls catch light from other souls who are fully lit and willing to show it. If you would help to calm the tumult, this is one of the strongest things you can do.  âFrom âDo Not Lose Heartâ by Clarissa Pinkola-Estes

      OK, I'm about as pissed as I get about this homeland security alert bullshit.  My excellent friend, Crinny, lives in NYC and is on pins and needles becasue she is a consultant for Citicorp, the 'targeted' building is right across the street.  Their whole office is wary and nervous.  Fucking asshole Tom Ridge then cops to the fact that all this code orange shit was escalated based on evidence FOUR YEARS OLD!  WHAT THE FUCK?  Which lends itself to a rather suspicious conclusion.  The Adminstration, yes, GWB, is directing these alerts to distract from Kerry's campaign and make himself seem more necessary and important.  I think it's DISGUSTING!  And incidentally, this is getting shamefully poor media coverage, illustrating that, once again, Rupert M. is a big bullshiter...Fair and Balanced news my asshole.  God.  Here's a quote from USATODAY online, which I never read, but they are the only ones so far covering this:  "Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, who disclosed the surveillance operations Sunday, said Tuesday there was "no evidence" of recent reconnaissance. On Sunday, Ridge also indicated that the government lacked specific information about possible attacks on the sites.    (AND THIS IS THE BEST PART)   But Ridge defended the administration's decision to raise the alert level."  Is that just the biggest load of shit....defending the "ADMINSTRATION'S" decision.  Yeah, this is so great, they already have a funny flash cartoon about it.  Check it out here.   urlLink Remain Calm 7/14/04   We gotta get these fuckers out of here, I can't take it!

      I've heard multiple mention that these 'stories,' including the Scott & Laci Peterson case, are mere sensationalistic distractions from otherwise-important news.  Here's my issue with that arguement.  I'm not going to deny that these stories can get a lot of airtime with sensationalistic journalism and hype; HOWEVER....Crimes against women have flown under society's radar for FAR, FAR too long..."This stuff doesn't happen where I live, or to any of my friends, so therefore, I don't really care to pay attention."  What these two particular stories show is that attractive young couples living on blocks like yours and mine are JUST as succeptable to this horrible violence as the women who live in poverty, in the next town over, etc.  The fact remains, violence against women does not discriminate against class, age, culture....It IS right next door, it IS happening to someone you know and the sooner we can face that, the sooner it can stop.  These stories are important because they make America NOTICE.  I'm not saying that it should intercept airtime from the DNC Convention (another travesty all-together), but it should be out there in the media.  We shouldn't have to live in a society that tolerates any of this and we so often do...the voices are small, the hand-waving and jumping up and down-negligable.  I say, keep airing until the message is heard.  I agree with Aho, this fucker should burn...   urlLink CNN.com - Police arrest husband of missing Utah woman - Aug 2, 2004

      Speaking of bullshit, this is an atrocity.  Both Clinton and John McCain are speaking out about these asshole swiftboat liars.  The following is from factcheck.org, a non-partisan, non-profit, truth seeking journalistic outfit that uses scholarship, not opinion, to draw true conclusions about all the destorted facts flying around out there.  Check them out..  08.10.2004  In an Aug. 10 opinion piece in the conservative Wall Street Journal , Jim Rassmann -- the man Kerry rescued to win the Bronze Star -- says the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ad was "launched by people without decency" who are "lying" and "should hang their heads in shame." We have updated our article to include Rassmann's vivid account of his rescue. It flatly contradicts the Kerry accusers and says Kerry was under fire, and wounded by the blast that threw Rassmann into the water:  Rassmann said that after the first explosion that disabled PCF-3:  Rassmann: Machine-gun fire erupted from both banks of the river and a second explosion followed moments later. The second blast blew me off John's swift boat, PCF-94, throwing me into the river. Fearing that the other boats would run me over, I swam to the bottom of the river and stayed there as long as I could hold my breath.  When I surfaced, all the swift boats had left, and I was alone taking fire from both banks. To avoid the incoming fire I repeatedly swam under water as long as I could hold my breath, attempting to make it to the north bank of the river. I thought I would die right there. The odds were against me avoiding the incoming fire and, even if I made it out of the river, I thought I thought I'd be captured and executed. Kerry must have seen me in the water and directed his driver, Del Sandusky, to turn the boat around. Kerry's boat ran up to me in the water, bow on, and I was able to climb up a cargo net to the lip of the deck. But, because I was nearly upside down, I couldn't make it over the edge of the deck. This left me hanging out in the open, a perfect target. John, already wounded by the explosion that threw me off his boat, came out onto the bow, exposing himself to the fire directed at us from the jungle, and pulled me aboard.  Rassmann said he recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for that action, and learned only later that the Bronze Star had been awarded instead. "To this day I still believe he deserved the Silver Star for his courage," he wrote. Rassmann described himself as a retired lieutenant with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. "I am a Republican, and for more than 30 years I have largely voted for Republicans," Rassmann said. But he said Kerry "will be a great commander in chief."  "This smear campaign has been launched by people without decency," Rassmann said. "Their new charges are false; their stories are fabricated, made up by people who did not serve with Kerry in Vietnam."

      This is going to offend so many people...I'm sorta sorry :-) From the Onion, forwarded by my brother:  The Onion: What is funny?  Louis C.K.: Sometimes I ask myself questions. Other times I ask myself boxes of Kleenex. I'm sorry. Was that too stupid? Maybe it wasn't stupid enough.  All right, enough of the formalities. Let's get to the question at hand. What is funny? Well, you asked the right douchebag. I know exactly what funny is. Funny is when a fat lady walks around while someone plays the tuba. Once you've seen that, you'll never laugh at anything else. Except maybe a skeleton dancing around while someone plays the xylophone, which is almost exactly the opposite of a fat lady walking around while someone plays the tuba. Well, a skeleton is the opposite of a fat lady. But is a xylophone the opposite of a tuba? History will decide.  My father used to say "Nothing is funny unless I say it is." Then he would hit me really hard with his car, and he would laugh at me as I lay there dying. So I guess that was funny, because it made him laugh.  I guess the real question is what is funny to me. Well, that's easy. Jesus is funny to me. Why? Because He died for my sins and He didn't even know me. Man, what a retard.
