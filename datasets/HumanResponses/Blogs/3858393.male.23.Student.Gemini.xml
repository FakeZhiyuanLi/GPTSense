      Well, I wrote this last night and I think that I shouldn't even post this cuz I found out that I don't write very much! lol. I suk at writing long stuff. I even put an extra paragraph inside what I had planned for "The Sims: Bustin' Out". So, well... Here is the review for Linkin Park, I warn u, it's short!   Linkin Park - Meteora (9 out of 10) I have heard a lot of complaints about this album and how it doesn't stack up to Linkin Park's other album "Hybrid Theory". I think that Meteora is twice as good as Hybrid Theory. I like the tracks like "Figure.09" and "Breaking the Habit". I would sooooo buy this album if you haven't year.  Upcoming CD Reviews:  Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand  My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge  Alexisonfire - Watch Out  New Found Glory - Catylist  Various Artists - Vans Warped Tour Compilation Album

      Yes, people I am doing video game reviews as well. In "The Sims: Bustin' Out" you play... Well, you play whoever you wanna! You can create your character and lead them through life. You even can build their house! You can order them to do whatever you want them to do... "hehehe". A big disappointment is the fact that there is only a few changes from "Bustin' Out" and "The Sims" for PS2. In "Bustin' Out" you can leave your house, move out, and you can play a story mode... I think that if you wanna buy this game your making a bad decision because the difference is very suttle... Even if you think leaving your house would be fun, you can only do it in story mode! WTF is that?! You can't buy a car in Free Mode! That's what we've been wating for you retards! Doesn't Maxis go out into the forums that have issues with "The Sims" game... Did someone post "I want to go and drive around town. In story mode only though... Yeah, why would I want it in free mode?!" They didn't do enough research. That's why I gave them a (5/10)Rental... It's still a good game, yet so is the original game.

      Wasup... Back again! I hope u had a good day... I am reviewing my first CD as I mentioned... Ahem! Modest Mouse's CD "The Moon and Antartica" struck a chord the first time I listened to it... I instantly fell in love with the songs like 3rd Planet, A Wild Pack of Family Dogs(LOL), and Paper Thin Walls. I love the style of music, I can't seem to find out what I should call it, and the great catchy lyrics and guitar riffs. I would give this CD a 9/10. I love this CD!  Check it out: (http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0001I2CDY/qid=1089180523/sr=8-2/ref=pd_ka_2/103-5678596-9962228?v=glance&s=music&n=507846)  Soon upcoming: Artist - Album  Modest Mouse - Good News for People Who Love Bad News  Franz Ferdinand - Franz Ferdinand  My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge  Alexisonfire - Watch Out  New Found Glory - Catylist

      Bored. Bored. Bored. My mom went to work and she took my game with her... Hopefully one of the people she works with is gonna help me fix my game... (Rollercoaster Tycoon 2) I know it's just cuz my computer SUX! It just plain sucks. I hope that I get a new computer SOON.. I would do anything for that... I see the people on television that are at those QUAKECON thingies and I wonder how they get enough money! They have all those NEON lights inside of the computer and they have their name inscribed on the metal on the outside of the box. I wish I had one of those! It would soooo ROCK! But, I don't I'm sitting here with this gay-ass Gateway Astro... I can't believe that Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 doesn't work on my computer... It has the worst graphics ever! O well, I guess I just have to put up with this for now... BUT WHY!?!?!?! My mom just called, she said that the person she works with thinks that it's a broken shortcut. It's not I've tried clicking on the main icon, it still doesn't work... Noone is reading this... I know it, only two of my friends read this. They probably don't remember the link... I'm talking to myself... How wonderful... Well, I guess it's time for a random word in the dictionary!  grace (gras) n. 1. Beauty of movement or form. 2. Mercy; clemency. 3. Temporary immunity. 4. Divine love and protection.  Ooooo. Interesting! I'm bored... I like reading other people's blogs... I don't know why. I guess that's why I like "The Sims" and I read message boards a lot... They blow me away with how many posts they've written... I have like 8 and I still have about 2,000 words... I write alot of words. I would make a good boyfriend... I listen to boring shit a lot... Modest Mouse for instance. I know that they're really boring. But I still like them. I think that it's really cool that they're like #18 on the billboard charts with "Good News for People Who Love Bad News". I think that's sooo cool. I feel good for them because I don't think that they got the recognition that they deserved until now... They have great music and they didn't get discovered until "Float On"... I think that is soooo awesome... You guys kno my dad is in the Military, he's doing the Crucible now. I guess it sucks, hes not gonna be here for another 5 days. But he was in Afganistan before, thats worse. My mom is hoping to talk to him when he gets back about visiting my grandparents in Pittsburgh. I really think that we can wait until Christmas to visit and get a new computer now... That would be awesome! We can get an Alienware computer!!! HOW SWEET! I wonder if they have CD burners!? AWESOME! I think that every computer has a CD burner now. I don't! I know this great website that I can use injunction with a CD burner.... www.allofmp3.com It's cool... Check it out.... I have been writing a lot.. I don't wanna stop but I don't have anything else to write about! OK CYA!

      Hey Everyone. In case that you haven't noticed, doubtful, I changed my blog's URL and template... I need money... LALALALALA Money, cash, moolah, I just need 38 dollars... I'm bored... In Jadakiss's song Why... WHY(hehe why I used the name of the song) does he say "Why did Bush knock down the towers" He didn't knock down the towers... Dumbass... It's a good song, but that line was retarded... Noone listens to me on this blog... I'm writing to myself... O.k. I'm gonna go eat! CyA... Signed, Jimmy
