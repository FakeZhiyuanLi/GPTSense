						   Aethor and Region traveled the Ice Road north from Thaen before turning west past the Ice Peaks. For two months they road hard along their course, dodging the scattered bands of goblins that patrolled Checle's northern border. When at last they had little choice but to continue on foot, they filled their packs with what was essential, and hid their saddlebags, and set the horses free to make their way home as they might.  They drew within sight of Ter-Cartin after a month on foot, and they knew they were in great danger at all times. Still, their strength was in surprise, for never had Lord Caroc considered an attack from the North, and lesser had he judged odds of spies, for that path was more perilous than any other in the west.  It was a moonless night on which they choose to approach Ter-Cartin. Region employed all of the arts she had studied at Dothnell, cloaking them in shadow and creating a gap in the tall stone fence just wide enough for them to ease through. Yet at the very moment when they might have succeeded, they were betrayed.   They were awaited by soldiers in the courtyard, and though not one their opponents was equal in skill to Aethor, and though two score of them fell beneath his singing blade, and another handful fell to Region, they were overwhelmed at last, and taken in chains into Ter-Cartin where Lord Caroc awaited them.  Little is known of what took place there, for never did Aethor or Region tell of those days, but among the slaves and prisoners there are some who survived and remembered the brave Lord of the Mirien and his lady.  It is said that they were taken to Lord Caroc and thrown to the ground beneath his throne, and Region rose at once to her feet in defiance of the Dark One, but Aethor had been sorely wounded and reached his feet only through great effort. Aethor and Region stood huddled together, in the shadow of the Dark One's throne, and Kuld, who was the Dark One's lieutenant, slithered towards them from the shadows. Aethor would not stand aside despite Kuld's commands, and so several goblins came forward and restrained him as Kuld took Region by the arm and released her from her bonds. Before she had recovered from her surprise, Kuld drew her near to the great black throne, and pushed her before his master.  Lord Caroc offered her an alliance then, between Rel Aren and Checle, if she would kneel to him, and swear her alliegiance, and choose to remain in Ter-Cartin as his queen; in return he would permit Rel Aren to remain free so long as its Princes did not wage war on him, and in time he would make her chatelaine of his domain, and train her in the arts denied her at Dothnell. Those who witnessed it say Region did not even pause to draw breath before refusing the offer, and Lord Caroc commanded Kuld to take both prisoners to the dungeons, and there they remained for two years.  It was late in the fall of 4048 when Region begged an audience from Lord Caroc. She was fearful and her spirit was broken and there was a horror in her eyes, but her flesh was unmarred and she was still beautiful to look upon; Lord Caroc now held dominion over all lands north of the Geant, save for Rel Aren whose might was still too much for his force, and he was called the Dark King. She fell to her knees before King Caroc's throne, and begged for mercy for Captain Aethor.  Lord Caroc then came down from his throne, and he lay his hand upon her, and she screamed as though the touch pained her, and Lord Caroc said, "I have named my price for mercy. Swear your alliance to me."  The lady trembled, and it seemed as though each sound that passed her lips diminished her, and in a halting voice, she swore out alliegiance to Lord Caroc, who accepted her oath with a mocking smile.  Cruel he was, and he had not forgotten her defiance nor those of her kin, and so be bid Aethor be brought before him, and Aethor was broken and bloody. His gaunt form hung limply between the guards that dragged him forth. The signs of torture could be clearly read on his flesh, and it is reported that even some of the goblins that hovered about Lord Caroc turned away in disgust.  Even as the guards dropped Aethor to the ground, Region started towards him, but Kuld appeared and grabbed her arm. Lord Caroc asended again to his throne and addressed Region. "One other thing I demand of you. You shall remain here, and choose freely to be queen of my domain," and he extended a hand towards Region. Her tears fell freely as she gazed upon Aethor, and the captain forced himself up from the ground, and met her eyes, and shook his head; but Region closed her eyes and turned away, and ascended the stairs to the throne. And when Lord Caroc's hand closed around hers, the breaking of bones could be heard, but though Region bit through her lip, she made no sound.  "Mercy you asked for, and mercy I will give him." With that Lord Caroc gestured to Kuld, who slipped forward and tangled one hand in Aethor's hair before wrenching him to his knees. A short dagger glistened in the darkness before Kuld plunged it deep into Aethor's gut. Region was still screaming as Aethor's limp body was dragged from the chamber.

						   Yet outside the bordes of Checle, much was in upheaval. The Caroc wrought destruction over the shattered remains of the free peoples; and those of the Mirien who had survived the War of Red Tears were hunted across all the lands of the West. Destruction was wrought upon the Pelore, who fled to the sea, until at last only Rel Aren held firm against the onslaught.  Prince Thalion then rallied to him all those who yet remained loyal to the High Kings and to the god and goddess; he raised a great host of White Knights and Mirien swordsment and Spearmen from the Isle and archers from Dothnell and cavalry from Thaen; and they marched from Luinest on Midsummer Day in 4059, and the marched on Checle in a final attempt to end the onslaught, for good or for ill.  As these forces rallied themselves, there was great unrest in the domain of Lord Caroc, for he knew well that difficult it was to command his Queen; and he heard tidings of her sudden care for his prisoners. Thus upon his return from the southern front, he went at once to her chambers.  Defiance was rekindled in her eyes and she denied nothing of her care and healing for those Caroc sought to torment. Fury rose in the Black King, and he struck her down, for he sensed little strength remained now in her spirit. Looking down at her crumpled form, he commanded, "Defy me not witch, for I am mightier than thou, and will destroy you." And he struck her again, and after each blow, she rose to face him, falling again with each brutal strike until she stayed on the ground.  Lord Caroc turned to leave her, but her words followed him. "Tivantalin I have been, yet I perceive less evil done by my hands than you would have me believe. Long it has been since my mind was my own, and though I have oft done your bidding, I have yet defied you. Region I was named, and the blood of kings flows in my veins. Tivantalin (black queen) I am no longer, and if you slay me, it is as Tirne that I shall die."  Seizing her by her throat, Caroc pinned her against the chamber wall, "Evil enough you have done, for did you not bend knee to me? Did you not choose to come willingly to my chambers rather than watch your lord die? Were you not chatelaine of my domain? Have you not tormented my foes? No, you have done evil enough, and never will your soul be free of its stain."  The inhabitants of Ter-Cartin were accustomed to the pervasive fear that swelled the tower, and screams were no strange sound in its halls; that night, the sound of the Dark Queen's screams drove many to their knees in soul-clenching terror, for any torment that could affect her so was beyond imagining.

						   The door opened and Aros beheld their newest tormentor; and he knew they were damned, made murderers through their good intentions; and he felt his breath catch in his throat, and for the first time since he had beheld Aethor's broken body, Aros wished for death.  Her hair was black as starless night; her raiment was the color death, of blood congealed to a reddish black, and her eyes shone still with the fire of the Mirien, the light of the flame imperishable that had long been extinguished from the Temple of Dothnell. Yet no friend or gentle priestess was she.   This was the fallen Queen of the Mirien, wife of Aethor Gilvenien. In her eyes, Aros beheld a shadow of her suffering and the chill of her soul, burned away by a fire greater than her own, and he despaired. Many years had passed since her kin had mourned her as one lost to death, and her time at the side of Lord Caroc had transformed her into some dark shadow of what she once had been. This, Aros realized with grim understanding, was the Shadow Queen, whom even Caroc's dark creatures fled from.  Maethen looked upon her from where he hung in bonds, and knew her from the gardens of Erten, where he had once watched her walk in joy with Aethor, and he called her daughter of Breante, Princess of Rel Aren, and the Blue Lady of the Mirien, but no recognition shown on her face, and she drew a thin blade from her sleeve and carved intricut patterns into Maethen's chest and she laughed at his screams.  Eight days passed before she came again among them, and this time she stopped before Aros, and she caressed his cheek, and he jerked away from the deathly chill of her skin. Grinning cruely, she trapped his face between her hands, and forced him to meet her eyes. They were as twin pools of despair, and he could see his own doom there, and he saw the world as it would be... All the people of the West on their knees before Lord Caroc, cities burning, his people vanquished at last; and he felt his body shake in wordless agony. He felt her slither into his thoughts and ravish his memories, seeking to leave him nothing to cling to, and he forced his memories of Region, dancing his Aethor's arms, to the fore of his mind, and the serpent destroying his mind shriveled into an empty husk with a final whisper of, "Ete nirthell edaw juiw, e emil day gersiren tyn hina yersor (Your death is nigh, and I can never be that girl again.)"   She turned then, and left him bereft and drained and adrift in a black sea.  That night she again entered Lord Caroc's dungeons, yet she made further attempt to torment them. Instead, she stood long in the doorway, framed by the heavy stone columns, wearing a mantle of red and black. She appeared then as a spirit unhoused, insubstantial and fleeting, and bent to a greater will than her own. As Erien's vessel fell lower in the sky and total darkness swept through the chamber, she moved at last from her post.  A fire of ice was kindled in her outstretched hands, and the chamber was illuminated in blue flame. She stood before the prisoners, all of whom had suffered much at the hand of Caroc in memory of the hurt done to him by Miron and his people; and she lay her hands upon them one by one, and the blue flame kindled in their souls, and they were healed of their hurts and found ease from pain. "Thus I redeam an oath once made, that the people of my husband I take as my own," she spoke as she soothed them, "and memory of Aethor's death has driven me to mercy."  And before she left the dungeons, she touched each of the five upon their brow, and eased from them their hunger and thirst and the horrors still near to their hearts. Long she lingered over the Aros himself, striving to undo much that she had done in the conquest of his mind. Only when his thoughts were knitted together again did she remove her hand, and with the rising of the light in the east, she did them a curtsy and departed.  The days that passed them seemed both short and long, for though they were no longer taken for new torment, and both food and drink were brought to them each sunset, it seemed as a new torture, for they knew not what might befall them next.  Then at last the Dark Queen returned, and she wore her grief about her like a cloak. Long she lingered without speech before she cried, "But to stand again before the forge and craft something other than death with my hands."   Levi raised his voice then, and said, "Help us then and I shall take you back to Rel Aren, and you can stand before the forge fire."   The Queen laughed then, and it was a dark and bitter sound. "Ah, so you would appease me Swan Knight? And what shall you offer me if I confess I miss seeing the forge fire reflected in my lover's eyes?"  She went then to stand before Eperial, and Eperial felt herself moved to compassion by the sudden pain she beheld in the Dark Queen's eyes. "Tirne, Lady of Aethor, beloved you still are."  Tears came to her eyes then, and the Queen remarked, "Long years it has been since any have called me by that name."  "I was raised in the House of Gilven, and many tales I have heard of the fair lady of Aethor, who was as a mother to his young brothers and a wall against woe to all whom she loved. Though I thought of Gilven as a father, and feared Aethor for his cruelties, it was the memory of Tirne I called mother, not the memory of Aleage."  Bitter then were her tears as she kissed Eperial upon each cheek. "Yet proud would Aleage be to see her daughter grown to wisdom, for little enough do I see of Gilven in you, and so I can claim you not as one grown in the House of Fire." And she went then from their cell and did not hasten to return.

						   I'm currently neck deep in family trees, maps, papers, and sketches for my newest work. Already this story is vastly different from anything else I've written (which isn't hard, since most of my stories are fanfiction). I'm hoping to put up the preliminary chapter drafts here, as well as some other things - vignettes, and journal entries as well as some writing exercises.  The rest of my stuff is archived at http://www.lynnjepsen.com
