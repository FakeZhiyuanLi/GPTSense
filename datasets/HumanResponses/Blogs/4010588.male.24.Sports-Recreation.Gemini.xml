      No Olympics on local TV NBN 4 debt forces IOC to cancel broadcast   Can you believe it? Out of the  220  "TWO HUNDRED TWENTY" countries participating in the upcoming Athens 2004 Olympics, our country, The Philippines is the  ONLY  one who will not be televising the games!!!  Let that sink in for a moment. We are the  ONLY  country who's not gonna televise the Olympics on local TV. Just us,  every other country on the planet will watch the olympics, just not us . 99% of all the people on earth will see it. We are the 1% who will not.  We will be the  only nation denied  of watching the biggest sporting event on television.  To simplify, the Philippines still owe the International Olympic Committee (IOC) money from the Sydney Games. From Y2K!! So the IOC gave us a thumbs down, giving us the preverbal pimp phrase "B*tch, where's my money??"  NBN 4 still owes the IOC, get this Austin Powers fans, more than  ONE MILLION DOLLARS . To cover these games, they'd have to shell out roughly the same amount... so that’s a total of two million  DOLLARS!  For easy reference to the local-yokels, that’s p112,000,000! Anyone have p112 million lying around in cash?  Now what irks me is this: I am blessed to be in a higher income bracket. I have the luxury of checking out the latest updates online, on cable, and newspapers too. So to me it isn't such a big deal for me personally that I don’t get to watch on local TV.  What about the others? What will happen when perhaps one of our athletes wins a bronze, silver, or possibly a gold medal? Anyone gonna know about it? Television is our country's top media outlet.  If it ain't on TV, it didn't happen . So apparently, the Olympics won’t happen here.  To top sports/television management people up there, what the hell?? The Olympics is in TWO WEEKS! (Well I guess I have SOMETHING to blog about)  By the way,  this isn't the first time  this fiasco occurred. Back in the Seoul Games in 1988, we didn't settle our accounts on time either, which jeopardized the 1992 games in Barcelona. Which, if you don't already know, were the games where the original "Dream Team" played and when basketball became a global sport. Thank goodness for ABS-CBN, they paid NBN 4's balance and we got the games.  The difference this year is this: I don’t recall ABS-CBN covering for NBN 4's ass this close to the games. And if by some miracle we do get the games, are we ready to televise it properly?   The Olympics is just two weeks away.

      according to ticke.com my IQ is... 126. Huh?   Your Intellectual Type is Word Warrior. This means you have exceptional verbal skills. You can easily make sense of complex issues and take an unusually creative approach to solving problems. Your strengths also make you a visionary. Even without trying you're able to come up with lots of new and creative ideas.   Scary.   BUT WAIT!  Theres More!   Apparently i also have a  Super IQ of 105??   The way you think about things makes you an Analytic Detective. This means you are an unusually talented problem-solver. You are able to think through a process step-by-step, and know how to zero in on anything that is even remotely illogical. Compared to others you are very adept at discerning numerical patterns and solving difficult equations.   ... eh? they said it not me.. I'm just copyin' n' pastin'  All I know is that I'm smart enough not to spend money on anything that tells me how stupid I am, sheesh!  =O  I will likely have lots to say about the intelligence factor in life. As you can note from my URL, dumbgenius.blogspot.com, i have issues on intelligence. hehe..  I am a moron.

      Old old old poem i wrote during  MY  depression era..  controversial perhaps..   DISORIENTED FAITH  I beg for answers, but I get questions Can’t help but doubt God's words, God's creations The worst of Christians, the best of sinners All the pain in the world, crying oceans, crying rivers Who chooses today, what’s right or what’s wrong? How do you segregate the weak from the strong? Bible burning baboons multiplying each day Everyone has their own opinion, so is it ok? Greed, envy, gluttony, lust? With all this in the world, who can you trust? Don’t forget, wrath, sloth and the big one, pride Because of all this, Jesus died- On the cross in return for each and everyone's sin We believe this; we live by this, but something within- Our hearts, our loneliness, our deepest dark side- Questions the bible; the book, the guide- To the way the good Lord wants us to live, To God, our lives, that’s what we must give. I trust in God, leave me he won’t, I trust in God, it’s his followers I don’t.  ChEdKo Edison Ching

      On the subway today, a man came up to me to start a conversation. He made small talk, a lonely man talking about the weather and other things. I tried to be pleasant and accommodating, but my head hurt from his banality. I almost didn't notice it had happened, but I suddenly threw up all over him. He was not pleased, and I couldn't stop laughing..

      He's at it again! haha!! On my way to our Church league basketball game, my car started to overheat! As I let out a whimsical *sigh* I searched for a place to park my mobile oven for a few minutes. Luckily I found a spot, no problem.  So I prayed a little quickie prayer: "Lord, not now! I've got a game to catch!! Any other time but now, puh-leeze!!"  Low and behold, I started my engine and vroooooooomed my way to the gymnasium in one piece. Yipee! Now, I’m worried about when I’m supposed to hold up my end of the bargain... yikes!  God bless everyone!!! hahaha!!!

      On my way out the house on a rainy Thursday night, man was the rain pouring!! For the past two hours raining cats and doggs kind of rain! Running to my car with a crap umbrella holding on to too many things!  A backpack of my squeaky clean shoes, my heavyweight champion of a badminton racket, A box full of trophies that i'm supposed to give away and of course, a plastic bag of shuttlecock tubes that people demand from me every five minutes.  No time to complain, I was already late!! I rushed, drenched from head to toe to my car, tossing each invaluable material thing one at a time to the passenger side.  Now plopped in my car, I shaked my head like my mutts to rid the water off my hair. Key in the ignition, I took a quick exhale as I prepare to go for another ride in the Manila Urban Jungle.  And as if God himself turned off the rain like a kitchen faucet, Ziiiiiiiiiiip! No more rain! Right when I turned my car on!! Hahaha! His sense of humor, quacky indeed.  hahaha!!

       I read of a man who stood to speak At the funeral of a friend. He referred to the dates on her tombstone From the beginning... to the end.  He noted that fist came her date of birth And spoke the following date with tears, But he said what meant the most of all Was the dash between those years (1934-1998)  For that dash represents all the time That she spent alive on earth… And now only those who loved her Know what that little line is worth  For it matters not, how much we own; The cars… the house… the cash What matters is how we live and love And how we spend our dash  So think about this long and hard… Are there things you’d like to change? For you never know how much time is left, That can still be rearranged.  If we could just slow down enough To consider what’s true and real, And always try to understand The way other people feel  And be less quick to anger And show appreciation more And love the people in our lives Like we’ve never loved before  If we treat each other with respect, And more often wear a smile… Remembering that this special dash Might only last a little while  So, when your eulogy’s being read With your life’s actions to rehash… Would you be proud of the things they say About how you spent your dash?
