       Well its 10:48 pm on Saturday and im posting my 3rd blog of the month. Well the night was pretty fun going roller blading around the community to get ready for tommorw and I was saying good bye to my sister since she's leaving tommorw to Toronto for about 1 month. One whole month with out a sister bugging me. Well the night went on and it got even better. I got a phone call that Im going to go to Vernon Bc for sure for a soccer tournie. I Get to miss a week of school! YES. This isnt till the start of grade 9 which might be bad but i have to miss it to go down there. So I guess I can call it a "extened summer holiday"   (Yow! One, Two) Out on the town, looking for a woman Gonna give me good love Anybody want to hang out with me? And maybe burn me up?  She was standing alone over by the jukebox Like she's something to sell I said, "Baby what's the going price?" She told me to go to hell  CHORUS: Shot down in flames Shot down in flames Ain't it a shame To be shot down in flames  Singles bar, got my eye on a honey Hanging out everywhere She might be straight She minds on her money [she might [want my | got no | run for] money](?) I really don't care, no Said, "Baby, you're driving me crazy" Layed it out on the line." When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said "Toss off buddy she's mine" Oh!  CHORUS  Hey you Angus, shoot me, shoot That's nice, wow! Uh! Oh! Oh! Wooooh!  CHORUS  Oh Shot  CHORUS  I don't want to be in pain Don't want to be shot down in flames Ohhh

       Ahh what a way to start school day by going to woods!  We had a sub which was ok since we didnt have to do too much work but then it went to Social Studies. Its not bad when we get to watch videos but when we do work its just plain boring. Must be the worst subject in school. Then it was lunch where I went to this corner store with some buds and I bought some food! Then i walked back to school and had a pine cone fight with some buds. Then it was Science where we did Bingo! I won a ticket to go to the Imax but I gave it to my friend. Then L.A must have been the best subject today! Thats a first but all we did was talked about Final Exams and stuff. Then we wrote a "reflection on grade 8 projects we did in LA" Then we got out of school and when I was on our bus it what quite a boring ride since most people were Sick or sleeping. Then we had 2 weird subs on Wensday and Thursday. Science and L.A they both were weird in differnt ways. One said her name was Ms.Torn and she said she'll tear off our heads and the other told us a war story where they would shoot at them to get off the balcony. I just was listening to Iron Maiden for both classes. And i watched part of the Flames game where they lost 3-0 but we lost too by 3-0 ? Well this is the start of a weekend of Boring and Nothing to do but oh well. My sister is going to Toronto for about a month on Sunday where my game is at so im gonna be playing while she is flying to Toronto.   Well This is the end of a Fulla Wangfist on Friday  Wait for more on Fulla Wangfist on Saturday!!
