      ...and Im off to my friend's wedding in Sabah. I must say I owe a lot to him as I survived in Singapore.  He has been there to guide me through the rough and tough hassles and bussles of that daily habit called work. He will be moving to Malaysia after the wedding to assist his tycoon dad.  Sure gonna miss the guy.    Life moved well for Nash. He has found "the one" when he came to singapore and its amazing how his wife elsie has grown together with him.  I'm happy for the both of them. :) At the same time, I thought about my "the one".  What do I really look for as my future wife? What character will match mine? What height should she be? How often should she take a bath? These are only a trickle of the thousands of BGR's (Boy-Girl Relationship) unanswered questions.   Ok ok... without thinking of setting criterias for Rj's the "one", let me elaborate how I hope she will be.  Well, here goes:       -She will be pretty. Yep, a face that I'll never get tired of morning til night.      -She will posses a good heart to all and treats everyone around her equally...but a little extra special for me.      -She will know how to cook as I only get to taste home cooked meals 2 weeks in a year.      -She will be romantic and truly appreciates my efforts to creates moments of romance.      -She will give me attention when I need it.  I don't ask a lot of this but when I do, she will give it to me.      -She will be patient to my childish acts. When the phrase: "There's a child in each of us" was created. The guy wasn't joking.        -She will have ambitions in life and goes for them.  Not neglecting her obligations as a wife of course.      -She will be healthy and keeps herself fit.      -She will be the best mom for my kids and a loving wife to me.  I'm not really asking a lot am I? This is not even a mandatory list. Rather, its a wishlist of how I think she will be or maybe how I hope she will be. On a realistic approach however and experience, when the heart beats, there's no stopping it and all lists are lost.  As I go through single life, I learned a lot about myself.  True enough, I am slowly identfying my nature and character and how I should match my life with others.  The world I live in does not revolve on a single sun.  Rather it lives in great galaxies and glittering stars.  And although, night has fallen down on me before, it was meant to show me that the heaven is filled with those stars.  Good night and sweet dreams.

      I just found out that the project I'm heavily involved in might be launched only in  July .  This means that I'm gonna have to replan my vacation leave all over again. Oh well, what else is new?  My sister's graduation, my brother's oathtaking, my dragonboat race, my friends wedding, my vacation and my birthday against my Project which I'm heavily involved in.  All in June. Prioritization is meant to lead us to completion.  I agree.  But when you can only spare 15 days and a limited amount of cash, you dont have much of a choice but to pick a slice from the pie and hope you get  the best portion .

      I had a long conversation with a close friend today and a realization dawned into me.  I  deprived  myself of life's priveleges for the benefit of others.  Enough is enough I say.  I'm not a Godsend saint or martyr of some sort but when it comes to human relationships, I have most of the time gave in.  I have sacrificed personal time and effort to fulfill the needs and satisfaction of others.  Remember that phrase that I'll give anything to see her 2 second smile?  It was not about me being happy to see it, but blindly, It was more of knowing she is happy for what I've done.  I therefore ask myself, how can I give when I havent received? Selfish as it may sound... but one can't love until they learn how to love themselves.  So be it.

      Ahhh...  Pride .  The first deadly sin.  There was a purpose why it was set as the 1st.  I believe that would be the one that would hurt most.  Without it, life would have been simpler and free from pains.  Ever wonder why some countries invade other countries?  Ever wonder why people excel at the expense of others? Ever wonder why couples fight? Ever wonder why people who are supposed to be happy are really not. Plainly and simply one word. Pride. Each one of us are blessed(?) with one.  The only difference with me I guess is the I let it rule over my mind. Funnie how I have strongly advised people not to do that.  But here I am at the helm of feeling it.  Remember that saying that that goes something like...Pride lost can never be found? Maybe its not supposed to be... maybe its supposed to be burried after all.

      ....and I quote... Management  is doing things right;  Leadership  is doing the  right  things.  I've always looked at myself as one of the men in the team.  Though the youngest, I've been around long enough to gain their respect. The hardest part of it all though is putting yourself in a position where age should not matter but instead the maturity of your actions and decisions does.  On a lighter note, I finally approached my ex gf with no feelings of regret and disappointment.  Strange as it maybe, she just appeared to me as plain as a friend. No fireworks, no butterflies, no hopes... just a good friend who I will be there for whenever they need me. hmmm...  is this evolution ?

      Today was the birth of a commitment. Cisco Certification. I've always wanted to conquer the exam. Now is the time.  Now!   Responsibility is what separates the brave from the weak. The ability to take a task without hesitation is a sign of confidence and pride...and guess who just did. Here I go again...

      US Visa, 250. Choc Nut, 3.50. Sleeping in a meeting with with your eyes open... Priceless.   A friend of mine told me he just broke up with a partner.  He was pretty happy about it and the opportunities coming his way from now on. I strangely congratulated him but the first question that came into my mind was "Why?" Why would two people even get married and break up anyway? Why did they even start the relationship in the first place?  Why?  Is this the price we get from taking that leap of faith? Is it even worth it? Does "the one" even exists?

      Am I ok? Am I over? Am I done? Has my world moved on?   Hell Yeah!    Its amazing what time can do.  9 months to bring a child to the world. 4 years to finish college. 3 months to get over a breakup.  Hearts were broken. Pride was hurt. Pieces were mend. New friends are known. Inner strengths are realized. Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome back myself to the wonderful world of Singlehood. The aftermath.  This is good... oh no it isn't....  This is great!

      Ahhh the time has come to prove my worth in the Singapore Dragonboat Festival as I participated in the race.  Finally, the trainings and hardwork was put to the test.  Ok... we didnt win but I enjoyed hanging out with the team... as a matter of fact I enjoy being part of a team.    Before the race started I told myself I'm going to give my 110%.  But when it finished, I realized I'm just an element of the team. Even if I have the will to give 200%, I probably wont be able to lift the entire crew.  Coordination, commitment, understanding, cooperation, teamwork and patience are the core values needed to build a successful team.  Hmmm... these values sounds very applicable to a relationship doesn't it?

      Had dinner at Yoshinoya minding my own business until one of the attendants spilled a bowl of soup. Nooooooo! not on my favourite shirt!  Football... more famous than the Olympics Chocolatechip cookies flavor Ice Cream... make me drool all the time. Green Mango with bagoong... I cant wait to taste 'em when I get home. Rhumba Frappucino of Starbucks and The Ultimate of Coffee bean... Im a sucker for chocolates and mocha.  On a totally different note.  I watched the average joe a few minutes ago and I was surprised that the lady picked the guy with the looks rather than the one who I felt he really made her happy.  He was man enough to accept his fate however what struck me was his love for life.  Being in love with someone, spending time with the person who you can feel at ease with, laughing, cuddling, sharing your dreams and thoughts on a romantic ambience, gift giving and receiving... these are a few of my favorite things.

      England 1, France 2. Zinedine Zidane scoring twice in the last 3 minutes. Thought the English had the game in the bag. Guess again... and again, they choked right at the end.  I remember having this conversation with a friend back in KL a couple of weeks ago.  I was talking to him how I am getting over my ex girlfriend when suddenly he told me that I am not over her yet.  He asked why do I try hard to show that I am when I am not.  He continued to insist to try other means to get over her. I was awfully pissed off and told him off.  I mean, here I was telling him how I feel so much better now and he comes up to me and tells me I am not. What kind of bull**** is that? Heck! what kind of friend is that?  What is his purpose of trying to pull me down when I'm already up. To think that I trusted him and asked him for consolement before. Some friend he is. Keep your guard up for such fake beings. Oh yeah,  they do exist .

      A friend and co-rower celebrates his 10 years of rowing this year.  He has won a number of medals and trophies from the numerous races he has participated.  Asked him how does he feel having achieved such feat... he said its not about the race nor the medals, its the journey and preparation that matter most.  Its the blood, sweat and tears that was poured in those months of training.  For winning is not only achieved by finishing first, it is attained simply by finishing the journey.

      Sometimes you thought you are alone in feeling what you're feeling until someone comes along and you know you're not. Each person is different but we all feel the same feelings and do the same things over and over until we stop and say "Im doing something about it."   I barely knew this lady and was only introduced a couple of hours ago. Next thing I knew we were talking about our relationship experiences and were having a great conversation about them.  I felt so comfortable talking to her and opening up, and the amazing part was she was too.  Ironically, she was seating with her soon to be ex-bf as I was seating next to mine.  It was great to find ourselves in a common ground and build our friendship from there.  We did and it was good.

      Dan Jansen, an Olympic skater never gave up to reach his Olympic dream. He failed twice in the Olympics as he slipped and suffered emotional loss when his sister died just before the race started.  He came back after 10 years and broke the world record.   Vini Vedi Vici.   We all have our days of glory... sometimes I wonder... when is mine?

      As I saw the lightning screached through the rainclouds from my Economy class seat on my way back to singapore last week, I saw my life flash.  The turbulence was bad enough to  increase my heart rate to above normal level.  I never really had the fear of flying until recently when I thought of the fact that I am actually dependng my life on someone else's skill.  I guess its the inability to take control of the situation.  The want to be in the driver's seat through the circumstance of not being able to. Strangely, I'm even worst whenever I drive a car.  Never feared myself and I'm not about to wait for the time that I tell myself I should've.  I've got only one life to live and I'd like to live it intact.   Yes I am The one who controls my fate and destiny.  But that experience also humbled me to think that its just not about knowing what to do all the time but its about its also about knowing what to do when the time calls for it. And that is conquering fear.

      Witnessing the unification of love is the next best thing to experiencing it.  It was such a blessing to be present at the moment of two hearts being one.  Makes me wonder if ever I will get to that point too. Then again, I believe I will be.    What a Ride! My trip to Sabah was an experience never to be forgotten.  It had feelings of different flavors far more than Baskin Robbins'.  It was a whirlwind ride that I had to endure, enjoy and enhance myself with.  I kept thinking of the two choices I'm always presented given a situation and learned that being decisive is the key to contentment.  But who am I kidding? Human beings are naturally unsatisfied with the choices they make.  That natural unsatisfaction is what drives people to strive for more than what they have.   I roamed two countries of 3 islands in 4 days, 4 nights, known new friends from hongkong, malaysia, singapore, japan, smoked (which I dont normally do), drank ( which I do on ocassions), smuggled (which I can do), sang (which I wouldnt wanna do when sobber), danced (which I hope I can do) and scared off a friend with a roach.  All these I can sum as a wholesome holiday indeed.
