						   Since the release of "The DaVinci Code" by Dan Brown, much controversy has ensued over the veracity of its claims. The book is notable in that it has exposed ideas which, although hardly new, have not been considered by the public as a whole. With the book still topping the best seller chart after after 71 weeks, and the film version already in production, it seems as if this juggernaut is far from slowing down. Add to this the success of Mel Gibson's more traditional (but equally ficticious) "The Passion of the Christ", and it's upcoming release on DVD, and I can't help but wonder...  Never in any time in history have so many heretical streams of thought been available to such a wide audience. Audiences seem eager to explore the possibility that there may be more to the story than they have been exposed to. Conversely, we see a return to fundamentalist Christian views in many areas of the western world. The stage is being set, it seems, for a a clash of ideas. Both are from a long line of tradition, although one current of thought has had to keep a relatively low profile until recently. I had a chance to encounter some of this tension recently when I attended a speaking engagement by the renowned author, Bishop John Shelby Spong; author of the book "Why Christianity Must Change or Die".  (Kudos to him on the title. That's moxie!)  Although I found him to be a very erudite man, and an eloquent speaker, what I think I will remember most about that day will be less about what I heard inside, and more about what I encountered outside. I was accosted by protesters who assured me that I would roast in the fires of hell for following this false prophet. My original urge was one of hostility. When I experience these moments, I've developed the habit of stopping to ask myself what it is that I am reacting to. I found myself looking in the mirror at this young protester about my own age; willing to argue my case to the last. I decided on a different approach. Although I am not so far along that I could offer unbounded love, I do feel that I was at least receptive to listening to what he had to say. I daresay that even though our views are diametrically opposed, I was able to bring enough tolerance and respect to the encounter to defuse any outbursts.  A small thing, maybe. In my younger days the outcome would have been very different.  I'm not saying I need a pat on the head, I'm just saying that there is a chance that I could have been just as guilty of wearing spiritual blinders and lashing out. I don't know if there is a name for the path I'm on. I just want the freedom to pursue it. Christianity may not appeal to me in most of it's guises, but I cannot say that it is devoid of merit. For some, it's a very beneficial part of their lives, providing comfort and solace in uncertain times. If I'd felt like it, I could have left this poor guy doubting his faith, identity, and the perception of the reality he lives in. I personally feel called and compelled to search for the Infinite in the manner I do. I'm certain this young man felt the same about his chosen path.  Conclusions? I'm not sure. But with all this Brouhaha being so prevalent right now, I figure I'll have more opportunities to see if I can be that tolerant on a consistent basis. I was guilty of enjoying the smirk that spread across my face when I saw the sign of one of the protesters.  "The Bible was written in plain English."  I figure that sums up their position better than I ever could.

						   I've become increasingly frustrated with the current state of affairs in spiritual matters. It seems getting in touch with God is once again in vogue. Britney,Madonna, Demi have all hemmed in on my territory giving all of us Qabalists a bad name. In doing a little research into  The Kabbalah Centre  (the proponents of this new pop version), I've noticed a rather marked emphasis on merchandise and expensive seminars. It seems as if P.T. Barnum was right after all. There's one born every minute. Enlightenment at a reasonable fee. It appeals to masses brought up in a fast-food environment. I am anxious for everyone to forget this fad. Then, perhaps, I'll be able to delete the caveat I find it necessary to add when asked of my interest in the subject.  "Yes, but not the Madonna version".     My thoughts today centered on our seemingly endless insistence on giving  God  human characteristics. The word  God  is a generic title which simply means deity. The unutterable four lettered name of God given to us from the Old Testament has been misinterpreted over the years. This only compounds the confusion. It is often referred to as the  Tetragrammaton.  Greek for "four lettered name". Comprised of four Hebrew characters; Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh, this gives us an approximation in our own alphabet of YHVH. Orthodox Jews won't pronounce the word; usually substituting  Adonai (lord) in it's place. The early priesthood understood that it was not a name in a traditional sense, but rather a formula. Each letter represented a part of the creation. This act was not finished in seven days, as most of us interpret the biblical account. This act is continuing at this present moment, and will continue to do so for all time.  Traditionally, Christians rarely look past the surface of such things. That is why we have clowns telling us that God's name is Yaweh, or Jehovah. This leads us back to the trap of putting a face on God. A name is just another symbol. If we think of YHVH as a name like "Charlie" or "Steve", then we miss the point entirely. I hate to say this, But maybe Yoda was closer to the truth than our current crop of holy men when he described  the Force.   Someone once told me that anything you put after the words " God is..."  ends up being yor own projections. I agree with that, but I also think it's a useful exercise. This is today's version.  "God is..."  a convenient (but inaccurate) personification of the Ultimate Reality which is impossible for our minds to truly comprehend. Thinking of God in human terms may be useful for a child, but it's gotten us adults into a Holy mess. Our army kills Iraqui insurgents in the name of God. Insurgents who fight back in the name of God. Israel puts up a wall to defend itself from the "Godless Palestinians". Do I need to remind anyone of the I.R.A? History shows us this is nothing new. Atrocities performed in the name of God are commonplace. Now if God is the creator of all, Is everywhere at all times, giving , compassionate, etc..., Do you think these fools would ever realize that my God must be your God. Logic dictates it. The name is irrelevant, and since it traps us in the mindset of thinking of God as a power who chooses good guys and bad guys, it's downright dangerous.
