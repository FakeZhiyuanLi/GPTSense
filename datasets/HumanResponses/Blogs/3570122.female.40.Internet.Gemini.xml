      Today we went to our youngest sons Summer School Fair.  Thankfully the weather was great and a good time was had by all.  M really enjoyed the bouncy castle, the assault course, playing with the firemens equipment, riding in the trailer attached to the quad, and my personal favourite, pelting the poor lad with very wet sponges.  M was really excited and a bit hyper when we came home but we hoped that is all that would result from this break from his normal routine, sadly we hoped in vain.  To date I have had to return him to his bed 3 times as anything out of the ordinary always gives him the night terrors, sadly a side effect of Aspergers.  We also were very brave and took our darling dog Lola with us and I am pleased to report that she behaved a wee bit better than we dreaded.  Lola is very much a people dog, especially kids, which is ok if they like dogs but we are having difficuly in explaining to her that not everyone does, and infact that some kids are terrified of large dogs who come bounding up to them in the hope that they will play with her.  In our wisdom we took her a good run round the park first to work off a bit of energy, so her attemps to pull my arm out of the socket were not as frequent or violent as normal.  She almost succeeded in knocking down just one person today, thankfully she didnt succeed and since he was M's headmaster I am very grateful that he likes dogs and didnt mind at all.  All I can say now is that I am very grateful that is over for another year and I now have 364 days to get worked up to the next one.......lol.

      Hi there, welcome to my blog.    As I am sure you can guess by the name I live in Northern Ireland.    Happily married to my darling hubby Aka, who I purchased on the internet 3 years ago.........lol.  We have 4 kids ( 2 sons, a dog and a cat), still trying to figure out which one is the biggest kid, might even be Aka.....lol.  My hubby  is a webdesigner and I am a virtual PA and we have just set up our own business.  We are also International Exchange Co-ordinators for EF Foundation for Foreign Study, and for those of you not in the know, we find host families for students who want to come and live in NI for a year and study here.  It is very interesting and we are always looking for more host families here in NI, so, if you are interested and live in NI, e-mail us and we will get back to you.  Monday 14th June 2004  Just realised this weekend you could keep adding to your blog, never having had one before I am still learning.  I thought I might add a bit more about our nutty family.  For instance........my husband was recently invited to enter one of his origional songs in the UK Songwriting Championships, which he quickly did and we hope that he gets somewhere with that as music is his reason for living.  Computers are what helps him make it through the day.  Since he is disabled and sometimes it is very dificult for him to go out much, working on his webpages gives him something to do.  At present we have 2 websites up and running which are family fun sites, but my husband also designs webpages for a living.  I on the other hand, know very little about them but I am learning through his teaching.  We have 2 sons living at home, R is 18 and M is 7.  R is still trying to decide what he wants to do with life, although making holes in other people (body piercing) seems to be what he is inclined to.  M on the other hand has decided he wants to be a world champion wrestler, this week at least.  M is a very special boy, 2 years ago we found out he has Asperger Syndrome, which is a member of the Autistic spectrum.  They also call it high functioning autism.  He is extremely clever, numbers are his thing, and I am so thankful that he functions at such a high level.  He is a loving child, but very devious and lies very well to achieve his target, which is usually food of some kind or another.  When he was diagnosed the doctor told us that people like M tend to be NASA space scientists, or nutty professors, so it looks like he will be very successful at what he does in life on the work side of things, what worrys me is the personal side of it........we shall have to keep our fingers crossed and see what happens there.  As for me well I am the chief cook, and bottle washer, or as I always call it the unpaid domestic technician.  I just hope we get round to having enough money to pay me at some stage.......hehehehe.

      Well hello there, welcome back to the land of leprechauns.  I thought about what to put on here this time and I decided to tell you all about my recent trip to the emergency department of our local hospital.  Wednesday night at about 7.30pm I decided I had suffered enough pain and it was time to go back into hospital, since it was almost 2 years from my last visit I thought that was not too bad.  The last time was for a strangulated hernia, and surprise surprise so was this time.  The last time I had been there it took 2 days to convince them that the problem was indeed a hernia this time it took about 20 mins, they know my track record by now.  So I spent wed night lying on a trolly in the a & e department and got moved up to a nice quiet single room that morning, with my own telly and everything, great I thought, at least this time when I have the operation I will get peace and my own choice on telly.  No such luck, aparently when you have the op that I was going to have you need to be well looked after and a good eye kept on you.  So when I came back from theatre in I went to the big ward with five other ladies.  The far wall was the older generation section and I was along the wall with 2 other girls, boy did I feel good since I turned 40 a few short weeks ago.  Anyway the last time I was in for the same op they kept me for almost a week, aparently that one had been really bad and I needed a lot of looking after, this time they let me out the next day, great you might think, only problem is living in a house with 3 members of the male population and still not able to brush your own hair.  Oh well, I am muddling through even though I had to borrow a spare duvet from my mum to put on my bed for extra padding cos I am having to lie on my back and as I have arthritis my back doesn't like that.  I also have to prop myself up at night as I snore if I lie down on my back and then no one gets any sleep.  It doesn't really matter that the rest of them all snore too in all their rooms, I suppose I am so used to that I dont hear it anymore.  The dog, being a girl, and more in tune with how painful it is for me has now started sleeping on my husbands side of the bed, she usually sleeps on mine.  He is finding that hard to deal with, well she is a labrador and does tend to take up a lot of room.  Thing is we went this week and ordered a new kingsize bed, which we will get in 2 weeks time, so why couldnt I have waited till then and we would all have had some room.  Funny the way life throws these curve balls at you aint it.
