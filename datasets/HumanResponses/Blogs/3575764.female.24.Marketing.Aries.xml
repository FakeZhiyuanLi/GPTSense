      I am leaving for Atlanta tomorrow.  My flight leaves at 7:00am which is the worst part of the whole thing.  That, and missing a Saturday.  I am trying not to think of that part though.  So this is going to sound shallow, considering I normally really care about current events, but I could not muster up any interest in Reagan's funeral yesterday.  It is weird, because he was the president when I was born and I am sure he was the first name I uttered when asked "who is the president?"  I guess b/c I don't know anything about his policies or him really as an adult I don't find it relevant.  Maybe when I am older and his presidency becomes "history" I will care more.  I find it frustrating when people older than me discuss current events from when I was a child and didn't know anything about current events and then expect me to know all about them.  I mean, it isn't something you learn about in books unless it is "history."  Thank god for VH1's "I love the 70's, 80's, etc."  I wold be lost.

      I was going to write this post about how I had avoided the urge to shop, but I just remembered that I didn't resist.  I totally bought shoes before lunch but they were only 5 dollars so that doesn't count right?    Now I am thinking about my job.  The point of my job is to travel.  I do like it, it is nice to be away from this cubicle.  What I don't like, however, is missing my weekends.  This is what I have to do this weekend.  I have to miss my Friday night and my Saturday and then come right back to work on Monday.  This seems unfair, but I guess that is what I get paid for, right?  I am just jealous of some of my friends b/c they have more freedom on the weekends and will be having a good time while I am schmoozing and staying in a stupid hotel.

      I have a complete and total addiction for buying clothes.  I have just come off of a very expensive weekend, with the hair, nails and makeup business for the wedding so i feel like I shouldn't spend a ton of money but that is all I want to do.  Not to mention the stolen purse/broken phone debacle and cost me over $200.  So...what to do?  I will use all of my willpower and resist the urge...for now.  I am sure I will cave eventually but I have to keep in mind my upcoming trip to San Francisco and the shopping possiblities there.

      So as I mentioned before I was in a wedding this weekend.  I forwarded some pictures to a male friend of mine who replied in an e-mail that the bride looked great, some of my other friends were attractive and I was...tan.  I responded by saying that I was tan and there was nothing else?  No other comments?  I was indeed fishing for the obligatory you looked pretty, etc. What do I get in return?  He would pay compliments like that when they meant something.  Wow.  That hurt.

      So now I will make a much more intelligent attempt at a post.  I have successfully created a totally average profile which I am completely embarassed about.  I consider myself to be a fairly interesting person, hence the title of my blog, but yet everytime I try to fill out a profile I become totally boring and forget all of my interests.  Why is that?    Another question...is this acceptable use of my work time?  I guess we will find out.    Now what?  I guess I could start off by talking about what I have been doing with my life.  Uhh...I had my best friend's wedding this past weekend.  I think that was my one shot at maid of honor and I was decent.  I tried to pander to the bride's every wish, but that is not exactly my strong suit.  But, the wedding did go off without a hitch and it was a great reception.  Lots of crazy dancing including a "you got served" danceoff between a couple of my friends.  Pretty hysterical.  Since then I have been trying to recover and stay alert at work.  Yesterday I had an awesome project that had to deal with numbers.  Not something I am very good at, but I got'er done.  Wow, when I read what I have to say about work I realize why people's eyes glaze over when I talk about the exciting world of insurance.

      This is a test to see if this works.  I have no idea what I am doing.
