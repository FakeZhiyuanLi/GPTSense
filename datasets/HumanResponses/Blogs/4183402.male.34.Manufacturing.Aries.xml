      Drug cloud hangs over Athens Olympics    Hopes of another record-breaking Olympics games are starting to fade. Traditionally, each Olympics sees many records tumble as athletes are able to take advantage of the latest performance-enhancing drugs. This time around, however, despite some frantic last-minute experimentation it seems scientists will not be able to come up with the goods in time for the start of the games. They did have some encouraging results involving mixing athletes genes with genes from appropriate animals but it's still early days. For example introducing salmon genes into swimmers' DNA gave impressive initial speed across the pool, but they unfortunately mated immediately upon completion of the race and then dropped dead in the shallow end.

      The news that traces of Prozac have been found in the UK's water supply have met with an enthusiastic response from the Environment Agency. "Terrific. Don't worry about it. Life's too short. Come on, smile, worse things happen at sea,"

      Are computer games encouraging violence?    When 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah was brutally murdered in a park in the UK in February, his grieving mother blamed the crime on Rockstar Games' violent stealth action game Manhunt (5 August) .......    FOUR men forced their way into a house and used aluminum baseball bats to beat to death the six people inside, all because of a dispute over some clothes and an Xbox video game, a court in Florida was told yesterday (9 August)    Hmm ... for me the psychology of a killer goes deeper than a video game, or a movie, or indeed a book. As Orwell said, power is the ability to make other people suffer, and it is the roots of this need for power and the violence which follows which needs to be understood and addressed. Surely this would be more beneficial rather than drumming up spurious reason for murderous behaviour when the worst has probably already happened in that persons life?

      A robot's capacity for insubordination, and a hidden malignity in artificial intelligence towards its human masters, is a trope that has animated sci-fi classics young and old, and arguably found its most succinct expression in the great Hal-computer spoof in John Carpenter's 1974 classic Dark Star. So when I read that   UK surgeons plan to use a robot to carry out key-hole kidney transplants for the first time I began to wonder if it was supplied by sinister corporation US Robotics. What if it turns out to be the poorman's C-3P0 and a patient dies whilst under going surgery? Will it be allowed to operate again whilst still nursing murder in its gleaming titanium heart?
