      im bored...once again...this is my second post..and i have no idea what ima write in this one...i guess ima just write whatever comes to mind...today was the last day i stayed after school..and i got a chance to spend time with christian..it was ok.today i did all my work in all my classes except rotc bc i was in the supply room most of the time..i really didnt want to be in the first yrs room.i was just bored..im so tired of school.and now i have this long ass vacation ahead of me..im kind of happy but at the same time im not.i wont be able to go to school the last day bc its my sisters graduation,and well its kind of going to suck bc i wont be able to see alot of my friends till who knows when..GOSH! im so freaking bored..i have nothing to do.i guess ill just go to sleep once im done writing whatever more it is im going to write for today.i paid my 7 dollars for this weekends picnic.but whatever.nothing interesting.today i saw that ricardo was running his mouth to some guy and his sister just passed by like whatever...and once again NOTHING BUT TALK..whatever...i really dont care i was in my own world.welll i guess allt he crap between my friends and christian is somewhat over..i really hope so.today i felt like crap..i mean goddamn it was obvious!but for some reason everyone said i looked cute..i spoke to ralph today..i was actually amazed.krissey me and ana passed by him and krissey said hi to him and he didnt say anything back..i went to go throw something away and when i looked back he was smiling and came towards me and said that why was i acting like i didnt know him and i was like nooooooo....thats how you are acting..and whatever i was with my friends and he sat next to me..and whatever he seemed to be kind of down..lately i felt like talking to him.we havent spoken since like awards night.but ima keep my distance from him.i dont want no problems with his girl and i really dont want christian to think i still feel something for ralph.im not going to lie..i did have feelings for him and i mean i actually ended things with ricardo cause he got me thinking we were going to hook up./but whatever..so much for nothing..but i guess it was for my own good.im not going to sweat it...he always makes these faces when im  around him like if he was to be unhappy...hey its not my fault...qwell i guess ill get on laters and write more later...for now buh byes....
