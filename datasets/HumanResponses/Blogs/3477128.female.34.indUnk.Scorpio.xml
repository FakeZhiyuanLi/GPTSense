      took some time but "they" finally changed my template. i think this one suits me better? opinions? please? don't make me beg cos i hate to beg? makes me look stupid. anyway.....so tomy and the kids are still watching lord of the rings (what ever the last one is called) and i am bored and surfing. just ordered morgan some really cute shorts, tees and a skirt from children's place. and even better i got her a pair of shorts, a skirt and two tee shirts for 20 bucks! what a deal! i have been searching and searching for decent looking stuff for her and finally found it at a price we can afford.   hmmmmm......let's see.........tomorrow if the weather permits we will be grilling some yummy salmon. made sure to NOT get the NASTY farm raised with colour added shit freddy's likes to sell. ewww who buys that shit? i hope no one so they will stop cos that shit is poison. hmm let me go for a smoke break now! speaking of poison! but ya know everyone has to have at least one or two vices. mine used to be chocolate. dark chocolate. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......... but now my vices are beer, smokes and caffeine. must have coffee all day long.   i'll get tomy to take pics of us girls and one boy with our new hair cuts tomorrow after i dye mine. and must remember to put make up on cos right now i look like death. bags and bags under my eyes. ooooh but good news i did lose another half a pound. so far have lost 28 fucking pounds! amazing i think! two more to go and i will be at my goal weight of 125. i may try to get to 120 if i am still feeling frumpy at 125. hate having a big ass but the only thing that will help that is lipo and i refuse to let some one stick a vacuum sucky thing in my fat and suck it out. ewww! yucky!   okay will stop boring you now..........  off to get another corona w/ lime and a smoke.....

(hint hint to you know who you are!)   well i have nothing else for now so i am going to go and do what i always do, peruse craigslist's rants n raves.   later taters

      anyway........this is fun. i think.   i also wanted to say a big thank you to my husband tomy. he is my rock. and my roll. i love him so much. should have thanked him in the first post but i didn't. oops! sorry! so now thank you to the best hubbby in the world! i love you! and thank you for dealing with such a dork as a wife. not sure how you deal with me but am so glad you do.

      so this is my first post. let me tell you about my boring day. dealing with a demanding 4 1/2 yr old is hard work. do this, do that, i need to pee and you need to watch me so i do it right. annoying but it is my parental duty. when my other two kids get home from school it is " so and so looked at me weird","morgan hit me", " i was stretching and accidentally hit him/her", etc.......goes on and on until bedtime. right now it is 9:29 pm and the kids are supposed to be asleep but morgan was hungry so i made her a cheese pizza. she became a vegetarian about 6 months ago at the age of 7. i am very proud of her because she is surrounded by meat eaters. and she loves the smell of bacon. which i make quite often. sadly. anyway.........i am off to eat dinner with my hubby and watch some crappy tv show. this is fun. want to thank dave for letting me view his blog and finding out any dumbass (that would be me) can do it.

      well. all the kids had fun and morgan got some fun gifts. the kids were amazed by the cupcakes i made. i baked them in ice cream cones and let the kids frost and sprinkle them. the lazy mom's way to do a birthday! lol! some random mom at the park even asked me how to make them and said they were so cool. wow maybe i am a cool mom!    anyway also getting ready for our trip to south carolina. will post our itinerary in a second.   tomorrow i am taking the kids to gilman park to the wading pool. gives me a slight break and them a good play.    okay here's our itinerary    Sorry for the wide distribution, but here is our itinerary for our upcoming road trip. Don't miss out on this great American road tour. Rumor has it that the kids will be going solo at some point in the future, so buy your tickets now! (Crap, I used an exclamation mark, I hate people that use exclamation marks). If you happen to be listed as a stop, please reply with address and phone info, as we don't want to pass you by. We won't be selling t-shirts on this tour, but if you'd like, buy some white t-shirts and my kids will create a one-off work of art, providing it comes with ice cream or candy.  Please note that I am a Software Engineer for Amazon, and the dates noted are completely accurate, plus or minus one day, but it is okay because I padded the dates I gave to my manager.  Friday July 9th: Livinginston, MT: We don't actually know anyone here, but it is a nice quaint town we've stayed in before. Gateway to the old entrance to Yellowstone.  Saturday July 10th: Bismarck, ND: This might not be true. I have just read the chronology of the "Crazy Horse" monument (http://www.crazyhorse.org/story/chrono.shtml) and a detour seems in order.  Sunday July 11th:  I'd love to see Ken and Lynn and kids in St Cloud, MN and then drive some more. Ken (now professor Ken) made Michelin bearable. "I write the CADS that makes the users dig... Ken's greatest hits..."  Monday July 12th: Windsor, OT, to Nico's aunt Cinamon.  Tuesday July 13th: Niagra falls and late into Carlisle, PA to stay with Nico's Aunt Nancy.  Thursday July 14th: Maybe see Dan, Anne, and the Rollo Clan. Maybe on into DC. (Hey Dan, when are those twins coming?)  Friday: Pad date, open (or makeup as needed). Every endeavor needs screw-off time.  Hey Joe Sachs, any chance of a meetup in Cary? (Joe made working for MARC bearable).  Saturday: Asheville, NC to see Anne (and eat some cannoli).  Sunday: The big G'ville, big party at my mother's farm.  Monday through Wednesday or Thursday: See as many of the people we love in Greenville as possible. Drink as much beer as possible.  Then across the south on 40, maybe stop at "Toad Lick Park" in Arkansas. Definitely eat at the Red Barn in Amarillo (even the sinks in the bathroom are shaped like Texas, best country fried steak in the world).  Try to make Rob's pagan wedding in Albuquerque or the 23rd or 24th (which is it Rob?).     From there it is just a "Hey let's take this road". All we have to do is be back by July 31st. I'd like to drag the wife and kids to Joshua Tree and Death Valley, but sometimes you just drive and find the adventure on the way.  Tomy  phew think we will survive this trip with 3 kids plus dog. i may need some zanax by the end of it. or in the middle.    anyway so that's it for now. i have a funny link to post. which i will do as soon as i find it again.    later

      so on saturday we are having morgan's birthday party. so far 8 girls plus my 3 and stacey and anthony and their two kids are coming. ack. i am getting stressed. may need a stiff drink before it starts. not a good kid birthday party person. and still have not bought the stuff, food etc....for her party. well we did get the plates and cups, etc......but no presents, food, etc......any ideas on what to get an almost 8 yr old? she is too old for toys but too young for tween crap. ack. don't know what to do.   anyway today we stayed home and cleaned and cleaned the house. or i did. they helped some.   yesterday we walked to amirah's house and picked her up and walked to mcdonald's. they had happy meals of course and i had a salad (which was amazingly pretty good), then they played for awhile then i bought them dippin dots. ick. nasty little frozen dots of ice cream. but you know kids they of course they liked them. i thought they were nasty and weird. why try to improve on ice cream?    anyway not much more to say but i am sure i will have more soon enough...........   later

      so it is sunday. so i am addicted to the news but since ronnie's death i am avoiding all news on the tv and online. i have had enough of it all. okay he's dead. his family is better off cos with alzheimers life is horrible for everyone involved. i hate alzheimers. my step-grandpa had it and near the end he didn't even know his own kids. sad. it's an awful disease. but i am sick of hearing about ronnie, his movies, his jelly bellys, his ketchup as a vegetable, etc.......so he's dead okay enough already.   my grandpa was a much better man than reagan and i didn't see or read days and days of stuff about him. though it would have been much more interesting.   as for the other BIG news! j-lo got married! wtf is she thinking? wtf is marc anthony thinking? sick sick sick. and SAD! she is the type of woman who always needs a man to feel whole. ick.   okay so when i got to a certainpage (25 or 26) i decided i wanted to get married but it's not like i married the first person who preposed. i actually had 2 "men" propose and i turned them both down cos they were not what i wanted.   finally i found tomy and realized he was it. we celebrated our 7th anniversary in march. this is my first and final marriage. i am a true believer until "death do us part". this is tomy's 3rd but as the saying goes "the third time is a charm", though i do not believe so in j lo's case. in tomy's case yes it worked.

      ronnie died. what do i think of that? i know i never liked him but i hate to see people die. even if they are evil and stupid people. i always think of the relatives they left behind. guess i am a sucker for that kind of thing. so he's dead at the age of 93 and i guess it is for the best, i mean he had alzheimers for 10 years. such a sad way to go. my step grandpa had alzheimers and he didn't even recognize his own kids near the end of his life. sad. if i ever get alzheimers i want to kill myself before i get totally out of it. i am only 34 but i have thought about my death a lot. i will not be buried in the ground. what a waste if space. cremate me and scatter me in gearhart, oregon and san francisco bay. hubby knows that and will follow my wishes. he also wants to be cremated. and he has a song he wants played at his memorial. october man by bill nelson. i want (come on up and) make me smile by duran duran at my memorial. my absolute favourite song. anyway enough of my stupid rambling.   and cort if you read this.......i love you and get better soon.

      there. well here i sit so tired i can barely keep my eyes open. hopefully this weekend i can catch up on my sleep. had to go to the kids school today for an awards assembly. max got the virtues award for courtesy. that was this morning. then this afternoon we had to go back to the school for another assembly called the little red hen. max was to be the fox but he was nowhere to be seen so tomy went to look for him and he was in the nurse's office with a fever of 101. again. this happened two weeks ago. just a virus or something. not sure if he is going to school tomorrow or not. if he still has the fever in the am he will not be going and will miss out on his field trip to the beach. such is life.   anyway will be going now. be back later. maybe.

(more on that in a second). so i call my mom one night and tell her i found bob for her. then i tell her who i got it from and she KNOWS her and said "omg she is such a bitch!" LOL! small small world! i mean my mom lives in south carolina now and hasn't lived on the west coast for like 15 years or so and the person who supplies with the info is some one my mom knows! how funny is that?   anyway just had to share that funny little story!

      but it still felt like monday all day cos the kids had yesterday off. seems like every day one of their teachers is sending home a permission slip for something for other. thank goodness these ones are all free! god i have such a boring life. at least nothing has gone wrong on the home front or else where. just wish i wouldn't go so stir crazy and get bored all the time. at least when the kids get out of school in 12 days we can go do stuff and i won't be going crazy cos it's just willow. she has been such a needy kid lately. need to find her some friends. and soon.   anyway cooking some faux chick nuggets for morgan then off to gather up all the clothes and stuff for school tomorrow. i have a few letters i need to write but i am not in the mood to take pen to paper.    so off i go to do my mom type things.    be back later.

      finally! that was one seriously long trip. it is so nice to be back in seattle. back in the real world so to speak. we had a good trip but we were all very ready to come home. the two best places we went were madrid, new mexico and the sand dunes in colorado. madrid is a cool little artsy fartsy town, like cannon beach, oregon used to be way back in the early 80s. loved madrid and plan on going back. the sand dunes are so fucking cool! you are in the middle of mountains and all of a sudden there is a huge sand dune! awesome. another place we plan to return to. the camping there is great too. no loud early morning rvs pulling out. a thing that really sucked on our trip was i did not get to drink enough coffee. normally i drink it all day long but on the trip i barely had any. sniff! we did 23 states in 19 days.   today we are off to ikea to get max a bunk bed. tomy was going to build one but the wood would cost a hundred bucks or more and the bunk bed at ikea is 150 so a good deal. especially since tomy's time is very limited.   as soon as tomy uploads the pics to our website i will post the link. we didn't actually take very many pics but did get some funny ones of the kids.    oh and i had a ball seeing my dad!! i miss him so much! he's such a hoot!  anyway off to ikea.

      welcome to sharona! i highly enjoyed meeting you today and talking to you. your little boy is adorable. today was a good day. after sharona left we went out and first of all went to the house of science cos tomy needed some wire for some amp he is building, they didn't have it. bummer. then we took morgan back to the e.r. at children's hospital to get her eye checked again. seems to be doing better so hopefully she will not have to be hospitalized with an iv of antibiotics. then we went to safeway in ballard which we never go to cos i hate safeway but it was easy and max wanted to get some aliens out of the quarter machine. safeway in ballard is weird. not crowded which is nice but a weird lay out so we had a hard time finding the stuff we needed. but for a sunday trip for a few things it sure beats going to freddy's. sharona you need to check out radioio80s.com cos they play some kick ass 80s tunes. right now they are playing jane's addiction which i have not heard in a million (it seems like) years. anyway max and willow are chatting up a storm so i must listen. sigh. sometimes i  really hate to listen to all the chatter but i usually do not mind. so off i go.....enjoy my boring ass blog.

      have promised myself i need to post at least once a day if not more. today was a successful day. the kids and i went through their toys and put a LOT aside for a yard sale tomorrow. i have lots of clothes i have become too skinny for and we have lots of other crap we need to get rid of. way too much actually. so i am glad it rained today and we could be inside to get shit done. i don't mind the rain as long as i take my "happy pills", but if i stop the pills then all hell breaks lose and you can commit to the mental ward. i'm serious. when i have had to go off my pills i have threatened suicide so many times. sad but true. i am not sure if i would ever do it but the with drawals from my "happy pills" are so bad that i feel like just ending it cos life feels so bad. i know that i will be taking these pills for the rest of my life and i am okay with that but i just hope that our situation always works so i can get the pills. kwim? okay enough of the downer shit! football season is starting soon and i am psyched! joey harrington is the best! he's a duck from oregon and he now plays for the detroit lions (which normally i could care less about but with joey at QB i care a lot!) and tomy is a big college football fan and is watching/obsessing over the carolina gamecocks cos he went to college there. me as for colleges i like university of oregon ducks and udub huskies. so anyway..........what do you think of the goddamn hydroplanes? i think they are just like nascar but the northwest version! ick in other words. would like to see the blue angels but other than that why do i want to hang out with a bunch of washington rednecks (who in my opinion are some of the fucking worst!)? i really need something to do tomorrow. anyone have ideas? free would be the best cos we are broke.   nico

      AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- Toe-licking could become a criminal offense in the Netherlands after a man who licked the toes of several women was released by police without charges.   The toe-licker, whose name was not released, was arrested in Rotterdam earlier this week after a woman who had been sunbathing said he unexpectedly licked her bare foot.   Other women had also complained, and the 35-year-old man has reportedly been pursuing his fetish for years, but prosecutors in Rotterdam said they are powerless to stop him.   "A lick over the foot doesn't qualify as a crime: there has to be some kind of objective sex act committed," said prosecution spokesman Cees van Spierenburg in the Rotterdam Daily newspaper. "That's the way the law is."   Lawmakers Peter van Heemst and Aleid Wolfsen, members of the leading opposition Labor Party, asked Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner in a formal complaint to change the law.   "How can you explain that we can prosecute someone for throwing a cigarette butt or soda can on the ground, but not for this kind of misbehavior?" the men wrote.    he's ruining it for the rest of the innocent toe suckers dammit!!
