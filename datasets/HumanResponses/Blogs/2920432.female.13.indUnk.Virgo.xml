      evryone's gone out except me (and lauren) and i'm really lonely cus she's eating her din dins, btw the time is messed up on this its like half 7. Boredom is really kicking in now, i'm even thinking about resorting to calling the guys, which i haven't done for a long time cus my mum gets 'suspicious' over nothing. whenever a guy is mentioned she gives me the lecture about how boys can have bad things on their mind, der, thats what makes them male, anyway, she doesn't like the idea of me having a boyfriend too early, whoops- too late.   Vh1 is depressing me - help  must.......pick up.........phone.......and.........call.......some one. damn it i will not call the guys, the conversations now r really awkward for some reason, either they'r still holding the grudge that their not 'cool enough' for us (sam made that all up btw) or they fancy jools and clare and if they talk to me then some how i'll know and it'll be the end of the world :S  wow, this is suprisingly theraputic! who knew it. rite u can now tell when i've been majorly bored - therell be a blog entry=D

      L M F A O!!!, the funniest day eva, i'll start from the top.  rite i got woken up by mum who sed 'oh btw, we're going into school 2day, not 2morrow, so if u want a friend to come, u better call them'. i eventually got up nd went downstairs, did mundane things then rang jools, c if she still wanted to come, she was still sleepin (bless, the poor thing) lool, i kinda accidentally woke her up.   we were on the way to pick her up (about 10 sommet by now) nd we were goin round the bend in the road, nd these girls ran past so we had to swerve to avvoid killin em, later i turned round to find out it clare, charlo, lu, loz nd mel. my mum nearly killed them! we picked up jools, and were on our way bak, we saw the guys still standin there, they were waitin for a bus.  we got to school, nd we just messed around in the playground, they'd done it all up since i had last been. They had these really cool speaker type things, like u know the can on a string thing, like that only with a red green and blu tube instead. i wanna b a 5 yr old again!! i got in touch with my inner child, lmao.  then my mum asked us to sort this cupbaord out, but i kept gettin distracted by all of the things in the nursary( including the bubbles)i dunno how jools managed to do it, she actually did work, i hav the attention span of a 2 yr old, lol  my mum really likes her now, cus she did lots of 'hard work', she even got called a 'good girl' lmao, now thats praise for ya!;)  we then went to pik up my dad, so that we cud all go to get the new car. we finally got there, (we were gonna meet jj but he broke his leg, awwwww, get well soon babes!) i swear it was cursed from the start.  1. it wudn't start 2. it wudn't move 3. the boot didn't open 4. we were driving illegally cus there was no road tax on it 5. we had a crash!  ok, going into the crash in more detail. we were at the roundabout near the nuneaton cinema nd franki nd bennies, and we stopped to wait to go. all of a sudden me jools nd my dad go flyin forwards, the stoopid idiot crashed into the bak of us, we cudn't report it cus there was no road tax on it so they might think we had been driving it illegally for ages nd we'd get into trouble wid da police. we turned round nd guess who the stoopid idiot was - my mum!! she had been going 20 mph for the whole way, then she suddenly dicides to rev it up, nd crash into our new car, then we got home nd found out she had not only cracked the license plate in 2places, but scrathced it nd loosened the bolts on the front of the audi!!  SILLY FOOL!     we got home, had a laugh, ate some maccy d's nd watched findin nemo all culed up my duvet, lol, cud life get n e betta!:P  bye

He had slipped me his number and his name, but i really don't wanna call him, cus i'm kinda scared that he's gonna be like loads older than me.   lool, a big hi to the fat doods that were racin each other on the mikes, i think tony won!! LMAO at the the guy who was auctioneering via opera! u rule!!  ok, all did for today, well, hopefully. i haven't been out wid my dad properly for ages. nd if things go my way, it'll hapen alot more!;)  lool, jools is the probs the only one who reads this so,  bye jools, talk to ya later         *~xxx~*

LMAO sonu's words " just for that, ur gonna dance" (ok, mebbe not the EXACT words, but near enough) then this other little boy came out of nowhere and sed that he felt left out and that he wanted to dance on stage too! so there was a mini competion to see who could dance best.  the theme tune went - GO SMALL BOY, GO CHOOTOU  a sehr funny evenin'!!!! bye!!!
