      Hey alls.  This is Christine, and I'm here with the first post!  Right now, I don't have much to say, except that in the next post, I'm going to put up what we decided at the meeting last week, and I will also put up some updated information about the trip. More to come...

       And so I have been flung back into the US. Literally. I envy Stinie for staying an extra two weeks. But there's no use in me whining about it. I have come back to the states, back to reality. So I guess now that means I have to use my experience in the Philippines and spread the word out in America. I miss the Philippines already, and it's only been a day since I left. The feeling is different there. America's streets are empty except for the busy malls and shopping places, but in the Philippines everywhere has people, life. I guess that's what I miss about the PI, the people. The people are different there, more hospitable. You can say hi or good afternoon and they won't give you an odd look.  But I have to say that my experiences were a violent wake up call for me, well actually epiphany is a more appropriate word for it. Yes, it's cliche to say "I am lucky here," or "I am very grateful for my blessings," but that is truly how I feel. I have always known that I am lucky, but it's one thing to know through TV and movies, and it's another thing to actually see the difference firsthand. It makes me wonder why I was given a comfy life, while other, more deserving people are given a slum life. It still baffles me. But God has her/his ways...  But that's thinking in materialistic terms. There's more to poverty than a shanty house and no food. Before one can become financially poor, one has to be emotionally poor first. How can a confident person, who works hard end up poor? That's nearly impossible because that person is always driven to work for her/himself. There are always fruits to any labor. That's what I love most about GK - they not only think about the material, but also about the emotions. They know the true origin of poverty is in a person's mentality, and they suceed in changing that mentality.  So this is my full reflection of the trip, not just for Stinie's benefit (project evaluation), not just for my benefit (oooh free ranting!), but for you, the reader...   July 22, 2004 - Manila  Just arrived in the Philippines, and tired but excited at the same time. We had orientation at the GK office in Manila. Lots of tentative scheduling - change this, fix that. I got so confused on which sites we were visiting. I'm dreading the mosquitoes, the flies, the heat, and most of all the language barrier (I look Filipino but I can't speak it. It's so utterly embarrassing...). There is dread but the excitement I'm feeling weighs it out. I'm excited to see HOME, to meet new people and welcome new experiences. I'm excited that I get to help, make a difference in other people's lives. Things like that can overcome any language barrier because we're all human, and all humans feel the same things. Those feelings are what connects us.  Even before entering the Manila airport I caught a glimpse of the poverty. Right next to the airport as our plane landed, I saw some shanty houses. And then on the way to the GK office, more shanty homes. There were even people on the street begging for money from the passing cars. Despite the poverty and pollution I saw, it's still HOME. And I didn't feel disgusted or ashamed in any way. Why? Because the people still have hope in them. Their poverty doesn't drag them down. They still smile, treasure their children, welcome people into their homes and offer good food. They don't let material wealth possess their lives.   July 23/24, 2004 - Dagupan City and Lingayen  I went to visit my family for a day and sleepover at my Nanay's house in Dagupan City. It was strange at first to meet my cousins who I have never met before but only saw in photos. They were all shy, and I was shy too, which made the shyness turn into complete silence on the four hour car ride to Dagupan. Eventually all of us came around, thanks to my older cousin Rutchelle who started a girl chat that night before we went to bed. The chat was the usual girl stuff: boys, what life is like over there and here, boys, school, boys, yup. It was really great to get to know them a little better, go beyond photographs. We're all the same, despite our cultural differences - just a group of giggly teenage girls. Yes I giggle...sometimes. Tee-hee ^.^  When I arrived at my Nanay's house, I just ran and hugged her. She cried which made me cry. I'm such an emotional crybaby (damn Virgo self), but that's alright. It's who I am, so there's no use in whining about it. I actually like that emotional sentimental part of myself. So many people forget sentimentality, they forget that other people have emotions. And to add to my emotional rollercoaster, when my relatives from my Papa's side - Tita Menchie, Tita Joy, and Ate Anjonette came - I cried once again. They teased me about it, which was alright since I'm used to that kind of teasing. It was a little embarassing though, since my cousins were there.  Nanay's house was old, almost run-down. Only one bathroom which smelled. But I surprisingly didn't care. That house is special. So many memories are held in that house. The antiquity of the house just adds to that charm. Then I went to Lingayen and saw the house where my Papa grew up . More emotion came. The place used to be a hut, but then they demolished it and built a stucco home, and are still building it. My Nanay Beatriz lived alone in that house before she died, and now it's just empty. It makes me cry. A house with history, memories, so empty and incomplete. I promised myself to go back and finish that house, as well as fix Nanay's house.  It was amazing to see the humble roots of my family - makes me appreciate my family even more. My familiy doesn't take things for granted, and even though we're not up-there wealthy, we still know how to celebrate life with each other. I felt guilty that they had to spend so much money on food for me. There was chicken, homemade chicharon, bangus, rice rice and more rice. So much food for my Welcome Home party. My relatives from Lingayen even bought a cake for me that said - Welcome Home, Allison. Tears fell again.   July 24, 2004 - Brookside  You hear about transformation - I've read my share of Pymalion and seen enough butterflies, but hot damn! When the titas and titos from GK say that Brookside is the ideal GK site, they mean it. It's even more beautiful than some places in the US. The streets are paved, the homes are bright and beautiful, they have a chapel with handmade pews of wood from Batangas, and even the kids get to play in their own basketball court in the center of the community. When you first enter Brookside, it's like an evolutionary timeline. At the entrance are the slums, the dump that Brookside originally was, then a few more steps you enter the real GK Brookside. There is still a lot of work left, slums still surround Brookside, but seeing how it is now in such a short amount of time (barely a year), I know for sure that work will be done.  Spirits are high in Brookside. The kids were happily playing basketball, and we even got invited into a beneficiary's home for some videoke. Yes, they have videoke. Isn't that awesome? JR and Calvin went crazy with their singing and everyone was all smiles. God, the kids were so cute. And we went to the activities building and heard girls from SIGA, the teen organization of GK, practice singing for mass. Their singing started out a little iffy, but they got better and better. The happiness and solidarity of the people in Brookside really show what GK is all about. Yes, the physical change is amazing, even awe-inspiring, but the happiness of the people there made me smile. Brookside began as a dump, where people had to take drugs in order to stay up at night and collect trash for money; but now the community is held up and the people are happier and more proud of themselves.   July 25, 2004 - Batangas  Batangas was a short, one-hour stay but it was beautiful there. Their garden was so full and lush, filled with all the Filipino veggies: chayote, papaya, banana, mango. The community makes its livelihood out of that garden. It exemplified an important aspect of GK - helping the poor help themselves. It reminds me of what my US history teacher Mr. Floyd said, "You can give a man a fish, and he can eat for a day, or you can teach a man how to fish and he can eat for a lifetime."  It wouldn't be a GK visit if there wasn't kids. There was more playing with kids. I got a lot of pictures of their cute, smiling faces. It shows that even poverty can't take away a child's smile. As we gave candy, I realized that these kids never get candy, it's a rare thing. I can easily buy candy whenever I want it, but these kids can't. They didn't take the candy we gave them for granted, they cherished every little bite. I should appreciate my blessings more often...  After that visit, I greatly appreciated all the food served during Tita Paz's birthday party at this very nice restaurant called Blue Bay near the Manila Baywalk.   July 26/27, 2004 - Cavite  We stayed in Cavite overnight. It was good that we visited Cavite since it's a GK site still being built. We visited three sites there - Aguayo, At Last, and Taiwan.  Structure-wise, Aguayo is the most difficult GK site to build because it's like a hill. Not all the roads are paved because of it. The GK builders have to make a lot of paved steps down the hill. The houses are pretty much built, and the people have a schoolhouse and a community center, but the biggest feat is the street-paving. They're making a lot of progress though. They're making a lot of progress though. And yet again more kids, still smiling, appreciating candy. They even shyly said "Salamat po" when we gave them their handful of candy. Like all GK sites, there's community solidarity. At the community center, the women of the site's gospel choir was practicing.  At Last is a beginning site. Nothing built yet, but the community is coming together. Before GK can come in and build homes, they have to get approval from the community first. Once the decision is made, GK organizes a neighborhood committee through Kapitbahayan (sp?). The committee is made completely of people who live in the GK site, and it is them who make the decisions. I got to meet the people from the neighborhood committee. It's great the GK always thinks of the people first. After all, you can't just force your help on others, they must accept it first. And if you make the decisions for that person, how can you trust them to make decisions on their own. The Kapitbahayan is very similar to the man and fish saying. We went swimming in the GK resort in Trece Martires City of Cavite. A really nice resort, and a good way to make money for GK. It is also a good way for the poor people to make their livlihood. Near the resort was some GK homes where the workers live. Once again, man and fishing.  The meaning behind Taiwan's name got me wide-eyed. Tai is related to human waste, and wan has to do with the action of flying or flinging, which makes you wonder what outsiders think of the Taiwan community. The people in Taiwan do not own the land, therefore GK cannot rebuild the people's homes (well not legally), only fix them. But they are making progress in getting all the paperwork done. We went with Tito Ogs and Tito Jay-R to the mayor's office where they discussed the situation. Luckily, in places where the people did own the land, they build a community center and one or two new homes. When we arrived at Taiwan the kids were having classes, and we gave them candy. I was happy to see them learning. Education will get them out of the slums and give them confidence in their abilities. Taiwan's location really gets to you. When I looked out the window, a factory was barely a mile away. The people probably work in that factory, but for barely enough money to sustain them. And while those factory owners make millions of pesos, people live in poverty nearby. Even the water which covered the rice fields of the community are filled with trash. Fortunately, GK is there to help them, and I hope they get their land soon.  What's interesting about Cavite is that it's primarily a tourist spot. We visted the Aguinaldo shrine and the place where the Filipino flag was first raised, and we even visited a resort where foreigners would stay. There's even a large SM mall. Those are the places people mostly see, what the tourists see, but the real Philippines is present in Taiwan, At Last, and Aguayo.   July 28, 2004 - Bagong Silang  The first GK site, but you wouldn't know it if you saw it. Bagong Silang was the experimental site, where all GK sites after it would base its planning on. Not a lot of GK houses are built there since Bagong Silang mostly focuses on community building and solidarity. That ties into what our guide, Tito Efren said, "Working with the poor is dynamic." Bagong Silang has the most gang activity and poverty compared to the other GK sites, which makes the mentality of the people there harder to change. They accepted their poverty and didn't believe GK would change their lives, but eventually they allowed GK to enter their lives and now their communities are brought up. Even though Brookside has the look of a GK site, Bagong Silang has the feeling. You cannot judge a book by its cover. Despite the structural poverty of Bagong Silang, the people there are happier and communities are actually communities in which everyone is bound together. Before the youth were into gangs and drugs, but now thanks to SIGA their lives have changed. And with education the children do not accept poverty in their lives but instead want to become doctors or writers, and even go abroad to make money for their families. Education is so important in Bagong Silang. I caught a glimpse of it when we visited a school there and taught (or at least tried) the kids a song from Gospel Choir. They tried their best despite the small language barrier. It may not have seemed like much, like the kids weren't making much progress, but in actuality they did. For not knowing a lot of english, they sang the song very well. Those kids have so much potential. And even if the mentality of the adults are hard to change, it's never too late to change the children and instill faith into their minds.   So that's the trip in a nutshell....a very large nutshell. I still have more things to type, which I'll put in later since my hands are tired from typing so much. I still have to put up a list of people I need to thank (and that's a lot of people). And I still have to put my reflections on the people I hung out with there. Don't worry, it's nothing bad. But this trip was definitely worth it, even worth more than the 910 bucks it costed. Oy... =.=;; But I am going to come back again. You can count on it.  Ooy, this post is long. Sorry, na.

      wow... a whole week has gone by here in the philippines, and i have to say, what a rush.&nbsp; we've been visiting GK sites all over Luzon, going as far as Cavite and Batangas, which is nowhere near Manila.  first off, let me just reflect on the past week.&nbsp; here was our schedule: Thursday (the day we arrived): orientation Friday: CAA, Kaingin Saturday: Brookside summit Sunday: Batangas (San Jose site) Monday-Tuesday: Cavite (4 sites here) Wednesday: Bagong Silang (2 sites here)  and that's just this week.&nbsp; tomorrow, i have a build in Baseco in Tondo, and then on Monday i have another build in Brookside, which is great because it's so beautiful.&nbsp; i just have to remember that i need sunblock etc. etc.  being here has made me realize how incredibly lucky i am.&nbsp;   but wait, before i go on, i should talk about what i'm doing.  i'm visiting GK sites in the philippines to tour them, maybe possibly help out there, perhaps distribute candy, etc. etc.&nbsp; GK stands for Gawad Kalinga, which is a project or an organization that helps take care of the poor.&nbsp; they actually come into the slum areas of the philippines (which are extremely dirty, laden with crime, and very disgusting), and help build lives, thus helping build the filipino nation one community at a time.&nbsp; they help build homes, start up livelihoods, take kids off the streets into the schools, and strengthen the faith of whoever will come to listen.&nbsp; the most visible part of GK is the home-building, also called TATAG, which is why it gets compared to Habitat for Humanity a lot.&nbsp; however, it's really different because there are so many things GK does extra&nbsp;- teaching, community empowerment... the list goes on.&nbsp;   GK can't be explained as simply as this.&nbsp; you should just see the site for yourself or some close.&nbsp; check out their website at  urlLink http://www.gawadkalinga.org   but anyway, the whole experience of seeing people - children, seniors, any adult - changed by GK is overwhelming.&nbsp; they are not only given the things they need to survive and thrive, they are also given their dignity back.&nbsp; they have self-respect, hope for the future rather than just trying to live out for the day.&nbsp; they are given responsibilities, and it teaches them lifeskills.&nbsp; GK also helps with instilling catholic morals and values into the people (GK is CFC - Couples for Christ, a Catholic program that started in the philippines).&nbsp; they are made known that they are not just waste products of some ugly society.&nbsp; they are gifts from GOD, and deserve to be treated as such.  what i see isn't just individual empowerment - it's also community empowerment.&nbsp; people are encouraged to go through PADUGO - to bleed for the cause.&nbsp; they work with each other to make their home beautiful and efficient.&nbsp; they also run their village - no one comes in to take it over.&nbsp; they are taught skills necessary, and they govern themselves, a process called KAPITBAHAYAN.  but enough of the facts.  there's so much more to see.  because the result of&nbsp; GK isn't something that can be measured with figures and facts.&nbsp; it can't be measured with numbers, scales, or rulers.&nbsp; because how can you measure happiness?  being here made me realize how lucky i am in the states.&nbsp; extremely lucky to have running water all the time, to have a bathroom available at all and any hour of the day, and to be able to get an education at a catholic high school.&nbsp; being here and making me see all the poverty around me made me realize that all of my complaints of old are so damn small and petty.&nbsp; they are such small discomforts, while there are others out there who worry about life or death situations on a daily basis.&nbsp; will i eat today?&nbsp; i have to, because i didn't eat yesterday, or the day before.&nbsp; am i going to get shot today?&nbsp; the rival gang is out to get me becsue they think i did something wrong.&nbsp; will i be able to feed my family?&nbsp; they haven't eaten in so long, and the little one is sick again.  and there's so much more to think about...

      Hmm...Christine hasn't posted in awhile so I guess I should post. We're finally going to the Philippines!!!! I'm so excited!!! All I need is a shot or two and I'm gung-ho and ready. Our flight's at 1:00 am next Wednesday. Really early, ne? Yeah, but that's how most flights to the PI are. And then there's a four hour stop-over in Seoul. Stinie and me are gonna go shopping for Korean CDs!! Hehe.   But of course that's not the point of the trip - it's about experiencing a side of the PI that most people don't know about, or just plain ignore. It's all about immersion - forming an understanding. I really like what Tito Joe said about how it's not a mission to "help the poor," it's a mission to help your country. We shouldn't treat them like "poor" people, we should treat them like our fellow human being. When someone is labled as "poor," we would usually see them as helpless, always dependent on others; but that's not how we should view them because if we do, they will continue to be poor. It's the whole idea of if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he'll eat for a lifetime. That's what I really like about GK - help the poor help themselves. That's how you end poverty.   Sure, there's poverty of materials and possessions; but I think the worst poverty of all is poverty of the spirit because without a spirit, without dignity, you lack the confidence and self-trust to provide for yourself.
