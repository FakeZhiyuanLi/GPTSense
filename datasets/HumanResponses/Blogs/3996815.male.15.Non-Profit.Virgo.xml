      Sorry I haven't been posting this week.&nbsp; But I do have an excuse.&nbsp; I was at Ragged Mountain Running Camp!&nbsp; Niice!&nbsp; It was totally frickin' awesome!&nbsp; But, I am&nbsp;glad to be home again.&nbsp; I was in group 5 of 6, which sounds worse than it is.&nbsp; Every day I was forced to push myself to my limit.&nbsp; Suddenly, I started feeling  good  after running.&nbsp; This could be the breakthrough I needed.&nbsp; We had a choice on Monday(?) to run between 3-7 miles on a fairly uphill course.&nbsp; Of course, I chickened out and only did 5.&nbsp; I really felt I should have run the full 7.&nbsp; After finishing, I wanted to do it again.&nbsp; I think I'm starting to truly enjoy running.&nbsp; I got to bond with my teammates, tear down my limits, and had a really good time doing it.   Wednesday was the last full day of camp, and I have so much to write about it's not funny.&nbsp; So we woke up at 6:45 as usual, but this time I lost 2-3 hours of sleep by thinking way too much.&nbsp; I was tired, distressed, feeling out of it, and in a bad mood.&nbsp; We ran easy in the morning, so it wasn't real bad.&nbsp; During breakfast, I was still feeling bad.&nbsp; I found myself not saying anything and just staring at the wall (Which is better than yelling at one).&nbsp; I sat there about 20 mins. after I finished eating, still not saying anything.&nbsp; We attended a talk about college level running shortly after.&nbsp; The guy just would not shut up.&nbsp; After that, I took a walk.&nbsp; While walking, I thought some things over, and I immediately starting feeling like normal again.&nbsp; Before lunch, we organized the teams for the big race that afternoon.&nbsp; I met with my team, and they were pretty cool, it's just we only had one real good runner.&nbsp; The theme for team names was underwear for the guys.&nbsp; We became the G-Strings.&nbsp; But we wrote G-String Spot on our jerseys (If you don't get it, cover up "string"), and our slogan was "just hit it".&nbsp; So we got everything going, and then it was time for lunch.&nbsp; We ate, the food was  great.&nbsp;  Since I was feeling better, I was talking and everything, so everyone was a lot less concerned.&nbsp; Then free-time.&nbsp; I spent the few hours we had practicing for that evening's talent show.&nbsp; At about 3:00, we met with our teams and went down to the course in the meadow.&nbsp; The first half was straight uphill, and the second straight downhill.&nbsp; The girls' raced at 4:00.&nbsp; Emily and Amanda were our only girls and both ran the leadoff 1200 for their teams.&nbsp; So, I really didn't watch the rest.&nbsp; 4:30 was the guys' starting time.&nbsp; Our leadoff ran 1200, and came to the exchange in dead last.&nbsp; Our 800 runner made up some time, but handed off to me still in last.&nbsp; I ran the 1000, and caught one person, and then handed off to our only "good" runner.&nbsp; He ran the mile, and we finished in last place.&nbsp; What's worse is that i specifically remember saying "I don't care as long as we don't finish last."&nbsp; Guess I care then.&nbsp; Some people jumped in the lake afterward.&nbsp; I walked with Tim back to our dorm, and we hit the showers.&nbsp; It was about 5:30 now.&nbsp; So we had 2 hours, 30 minutes until the talent show.&nbsp; I spent the whole time practicing my routine, which I got down pretty well.&nbsp; Not much else until 8:00.&nbsp; So the talent show featured the girls getting hit by water balloons, a magic act, a girl's dance routine, a guy's dance/singing routine, two guys on guitars,&nbsp;and a group of 5/6 guys stripping (disgusting).&nbsp; So Tim got the pole beside him humped by a guy.&nbsp; You should have seen the look on his face!!!&nbsp; Amanda had a guy sing part of their song to her.&nbsp; And I was in the show.&nbsp; Everything went well.&nbsp; I had Brandon toss my third bean bag from the crowd to start my act.&nbsp; I did four tricks, off the thigh, under the leg, off the head, and behind the back.&nbsp; I dropped the behind the back, but we saved face by Tim calling&nbsp;a fault and me arguing with him ("You can't be serious!!!!").&nbsp; I had a shitload of variation juggling including, high, low, reverse, shower, one-handed, and tennis.&nbsp; Plus my big finale, which consisted of me throwing all three up high, and walking away with my lovely assistants.&nbsp; Tim came up, grabbed the bags, took a bow, and walked off.&nbsp; It was totally awesome.&nbsp; By then it was 9:00 and they started the party/dance/campfire.&nbsp; We hooked up my stereo as the official party "jam box" as Brad liked to call it.&nbsp; I spent the first hour really doing nothing.&nbsp; Then I met up with Amanda and Emily.&nbsp; None of us wanted to dance or hang out at the party, so we spent the last hour walking around in the dark.&nbsp; It was really fun, we were laughing and talking about absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Then we had a serious, "interesting" conversation that I can't discuss.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; It was about time to sleep (11:00) so we went our seperate ways.&nbsp; When I got back to the dorm, Lich was  convinced &nbsp;that I had "woofwoofEHhehhehnudgenudgerowrrowrhowlpantpantpanthonkhonk".&nbsp; "What?" "intercourse" "oh.."&nbsp; Yes, Lich thought i had stayed out having sex.&nbsp; He said it was the way I came in and acted.&nbsp; I was really happy I guess.&nbsp; While I would have liked to agree with him, that would have been a lie.&nbsp; FOR THE RECORD I HAD NO SEX OF ANY KIND.&nbsp; Anyway, after that we stayed up having fun for a while including Lich writing "Hump This!" on Jon Read's pillow in Cheez-Wiz.&nbsp; We went to sleep, and for the first time that week, I slept really well.   That was absolutely, no doubt, overall, the best day I've had in recent memory.

      Here I am again, after a 8:00 practice.&nbsp; We ran the Cross Country course today, so just over 3 miles.&nbsp; I'd forgotten how hard it is to race, I didn't quite have the rhythm I used to.&nbsp; I caught my biggest competitor, Ben, in the last .1 mile.&nbsp; Think I finished just over 21:00.&nbsp; That's a good sign, because I'm almost to where I finished last year now.&nbsp; Calf didn't bother me until after I ran today, but my foot went kind of numb at the very end.&nbsp; It was weird.&nbsp; My calf is still hurting nearly an hour after running, which is the worst its been lately.&nbsp; Running camp starts on Sunday!!!&nbsp; I'm really looking forward to that, I just hope my leg doesn't fall off.  On a side note, Michael Harvey is driving now.&nbsp; Look out.

      This is NOT a blatant rip-off of Brad.&nbsp; OK, so it is.&nbsp;   Now.&nbsp; "How do you do, don't think we've met.&nbsp; My name is Ian, and I'm in Minor Threat."&nbsp; Actually, my name is Cullen O'Neil, and I'm a long distance runner, atheist, and self-proclaimed punk rocker.&nbsp; I run for Stuarts Draft High School, and after this summer, I'll be a junior.&nbsp; This is my running log!!!&nbsp; I have one goal for running, and that is to one day reach the level of my brother, Brad.&nbsp; He's really an annoying ass sometimes, but I really look up to him as a runner.   Junior goals:  XC (5K)-17:59  1600-5:00  3200-10:40?   I don't really know about the 3200, I've never run it before.&nbsp; I'll update it later.   Time for a little history.&nbsp; I never planned to run at all, and I didn't my freshman year.&nbsp; Everyone, especially Brad, was telling me "you should try it, it's fun!"&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Fun wasn't my choice adjective after a few days of XC conditioning the next year.&nbsp; I stuck with it, and ended up as the 5th runner.&nbsp; My PR was 20:00.43 (believe it or not).&nbsp; I was so dissapointed after not hitting 19.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I think this is the force fueling my serious running this year.&nbsp; I sucked at Indoor Track, I ran the mile, and ocassionally the 1000 and 4x800.&nbsp; There's a story behind the district mile, which i will reveal tommorow(?).&nbsp; I chose my favorite sport, Tennis, over Spring Track.&nbsp; I showed extreme improvement in tennis.&nbsp; The team was good, but the coach was a COMPLETE ASSHOLE.&nbsp; I HATE HIM.&nbsp; I WANT HIM DEAD.&nbsp; Not thinking of his younger players Jordan (the asshole), only put me, and my partner Tim, in one blowout match.&nbsp; And that was because there were 2 players missing or something.&nbsp; With graduations and such, the tennis team is left with only 4 good people.&nbsp; Thats two away from a team.&nbsp; I'm gonna tell off Jordan this spring, and&nbsp;It's going to be great, because then I can close the conversation by telling him "I'm not coming back this year.&nbsp; Let's see how you do with 3 guys, Motherfucker."&nbsp; Yeah, that's right.&nbsp; Barring some monumental collapse of my running ability, I'm probably quitting tennis for track.&nbsp; If I go to Footlocker South (big awesome race), then it will be a sure thing.   Wow.&nbsp; I've been writing for a while.&nbsp; Well, I'm tired and have early practice tommorow.&nbsp;I'll try to update as much as possible, but I might forget about it or lose interest, like my website, Kratopia.&nbsp; (explained later)   Goodnight.

      Is he a jerk?  No! Just confused, Jeff don't wear regular shoes.  Holy shit, what a day.  Wake up at 11:00, Olympics, pictures, run, home, recruiting, and then home again.  Like I said, I woke up at 11:00, which gave me 10 hours of sleep.  Then I ate stuff and watched the Olympics pretty much the whole day.  At least until 3:00.  Then I got ready for practice.  It was fall sports picture day.  Of course, barely anyone showed up.  Brandon had the brilliant idea yesterday to have the guys wear their warmups for pictures.  Sounded good at first, because the uniforms are girly and suck.  But, nobody seemed to take into account the whole "hot as the frickin' sun" factor.  Let me tell you, they don't call them warmups for nothing.  We were sweating like people that are really hot.  I practically was ripping mine off when pics were over.  Then practiced resumed as normally planned.  Warm-up (not wearing warmups), stretch, run.  So the run had a "tempo" in front of it.  Run the course normally for 2 mins. and sprint for 1.  Ouch.  I ended up finishing at 21:40.  I can't wait 'till the speed work hits and that times falls like a soldier.  Then we decided to do a 20 min. easy cool-down type run.  Coach ended up cancelling that.  I was kinda dissapointed.  I may have looked tired, but I was ready for 20 more mins.  Then I went home.  At this point, it was about 5:00.  The High School Freshmen Orientation was at 6:00.  The XC team uses Orientation as a recruiting ground for naive, eager, wide-eyed freshmen.  Of course, the upcoming freshmen get lazier every year.  The bastards.  So, I took the next 40-50 mins. to shower, get dressed, eat, and prepare for the whole thing.  Then I went back to the school.  We set up the table outside the library.  We sat there for 2 hours yelling at freshmen to sign up.  We tried everything, man.  Polietly asking, yelling, bribing, stretching the truth, and ended up just plain lying (Join the Sky-Diving Club!

      ...And Monday brings us all back to practice.   Some  of us.  All 5 girls showed up!  But...only 5 guys showed up.  OK, 5 is an exaggeration, but its close.  I think there were 7 of us men (we are men, men, men...), but I could be wrong.  That includes some guy I've never seen before in my life.  I guess I should have asked him his name.  I'll do it tommorow.  We decided to start practice att 3:30, and I guess its a good idea, if you're an  IDIOT !!!  It was SO FRICKIN' HOT it wasn't even funny.  Not even "ha ha" funny (believe it or not).  "It's so hot I can't even think, I need some air, I need a drink!".  So during the warm-up, we found the two most important reasons to not run at 3:30 unless we absolutely have to.  1) Way too hot, obviously.  2) The bugs.  They weren't giant stinging bees or nuclear locusts, they were just those little tiny flies you can barely even see, but damn were they annoying.  They were flying at our face, like 20 at a time.  I felt like I was on a motorcycle!  That was just the first 10 minutes (holy shit Ken, there's more!?), it just gets worse from there.  We were then instructed to do an "easy" 50 minute run.  Of course, I don't know about the others, but I got dehydrated about 15 minutes in.  Really dehydrated.  I should have stopped, but I felt like I couldn't.  The whole time I felt like some idiot running for the very first time.  Honestly, I felt like shit.  This is all your fault Lyndhurst Road!  So, for me at least, it wasn't a very good run at all.  But wait!  There's even more!  (Usually you have to pay double for that, Cotton).  They fucked up our uniforms.  They were off by quite a bit.  They wrote Cougars in cursive, with an awful looking, weak, girly paw for a "C".  Plus, they didn't put -CC-> on it anywhere.  They're, they're...generic!  Nooooooooooooooo!  The dumbass football team could wear them and it would work.  I told Coach we need to return them, but I think we're stuck with them.  Now, I don't get to wear the only XC uniform (aside from Brad's) that wasn't burned in the field house.  The uniforms are horrible!  Words cannot describe how awful they are.  We're going to look like frickin' pansies out there.  We should set fire to them, so we can get good ones next year.  What a  great  (sarcasm intended) way to start the season.  Yesterday, I talked Clayton into coming to practice before the first day of school.  He should get some bonus points, even if its just 2-3 days before school.  I also found out that he only lives 3.6 miles away from me.  So, I have decided to go to his house and throw monkey shit on his living quarters for no real reason.  If you want to throw things at Clayton's house, you're invited.  Hahaha, sucker.  That's all for today.  G'wan git!  BRAD'S COLLEGE COUNTDOWN: 6 Days

      "OK here we go!  I hope we don't see any villains!  ...Oh no!  A villain!" "Ahhhhh!  I am a villain!  ...Oh no, I am vanquished!"  Ah, classic.  Well, today was Sunday, and you know what that means...  No church for atheists!  You gotta love it.  I woke up at 10:00 today, which was really early for me.  I had 2 bowls of cereal and a stale pop-tart (disgusting).  Then I watched some of the Games of the 28th Olympiad.  To save myself some time I'm just going to say it was one of those long, lazy, boring Sundays that everyone loves...or hates...(I can't remember which).  Until 4:00.  Thats when I went for my daily run.  All I can say:   "Ouch" .  I left my house and ran onto Lyndhurst Road.  I ran all the way to the end and all the way back.  The way up was slightly uphill the whole way, so it wasn't entirely easy.  I reached the end (the one close to the railroad crossing), and turned around.  Elapsed time: 22 minutes.  But, the second I turned around, I was suddenly hit by a sudden heat wave.  Now bear in mind it was only 74 degrees.  Still, I felt immediately hot and tired.  This would be normal had I of felt it on the way up.  But I didn't.  To make things worse, the only shade on the 3 mile (I think) road was at the very ends of the road.  Therefore, I had upwards of 20 minutes of running to look forward to in the hot sun.  I made it to the bottom of Lyndhurst Road, facing  a last 2 minute uphill to my house.  I eventually made it, almost dead, to my driveway.  Elapsed time: 50 minutes.  Yeah, I know I lost 6 minutes on the way back.  I was just lucky to be alive.  Last time I ever run down that way again.  You're right, I'll probably be back there next weekend.  And that's where I stand (not dead in a heap of rotting flesh) right now.  Though I feel somewhat stronger having completed that task.  Well, tommorow starts practice again.  I'm trying to get Clayton to get out here before the first day of school.   Trying .  I will leave you with these words of wisdom:  "Never run down Lyndhurst Road.  Ever."  BRAD'S COLLEGE COUNTDOWN:  7 Days

      No running today, because I was doing too much other stuff today.  I guess this is my off day.  I hope I can run on Sunday.  I did do a cross-country-team-related-event, a.k.a. cleaning up at the Hershey Picnic.  Last year, Coach said 8 or so runners showed up for this amazing event.  So, with so many more runners who are willing to work, we should have had a lot more people right?  We had 4 (I saw that one coming).  Shit (damn).  It was OK, though.  Coulton, Mike Harv, Chris, and I, (that's gramatically correct), showed up for the picnic.  It was really fun.  For the next 1 1/2 hours, we would embark on a voyage from Milan to Minsk (or maybe just around the picnic).  First we kind of walked around for a while.  Then Coulton and I went down the big slide.  Now, bear in mind that we were the only ones over 5' to go down the slide today.  OK, mabye it was 4'.  Aside from us, only 5 year olds were doing it.  I guess it was their loss, because that was really, really fun!  I swear we had more fun than the kids did on that thing.  Before the end of the day, the two of us would go down it 4 times.  Then we hung around for a while.  Then we went to get some food.  They had stuff like burgers, chicken, hot dogs, chips, beans, and cookies.  So the food was really good.  Then we all decided to get sno-cones.  We ended up drinking the syrup from the bottom of the cone with hilarious consequences.  Next on our day of hijinx, we went to get cotton candy.  It was good cotton candy (as opposed to bad cotton candy, which I have never had).  Once we finished, all four of us (thats right) all went down the big slide.  Chris and Harvey did it once, while Coulton and I went three times, completing our total of 4 times.  Then...(this is the good part)...we got cotton candy!...again.  So we ate that, then went to clean up.  We got all the dishes and took them to the high school and washed them.  Wheeee!  Then we went home, and I don't know about the rest but I fell asleep at 4:00.  And woke up about an hour ago.  I've been catching up on sleep lately.  Or maybe I'm storing it for when school starts.  Oh yea, I almost forgot.  Yesterday Brad and I went over to Tim's to watch the Olympic Opening Ceremonies.  It was cool, even though it was 4 hours of crap.  This is one of those things that's funny only when other people are around.  The commentators sucked ass.  Anyway, we didn't let that ruin the first appearance of Metopia in the Olympic Games.  In fact, Metopia had a good amount of athletes for it's size.  We were there from 8 to 12.  Long hours but good fun.  I say good day!  BRAD'S COLLEGE LEAVING COUNTDOWN:  8 Days

      Rummage through your mailboxes...  A full week of practice down.  It seemed to fly by.  I'll probably run tommorow or Sunday.  Now down to business.  Practice started out fairly easy today, with 25 minutes of free running.  That's after the warm-up/stretch of course.  25 minutes of running.  I thought "hmmm, this is sure an easy practice", but I was too stupid to realize that we were saving for the really hard part (Damn).  Coach decided to have us work on our sprinting.  He had us run the last part of the course (downhill, turn, finish) in full tilt.  Oh that's not even the best part (Oh no).  After we finished, we got to do it 3 more times! (Carl: Oh, good).  I averaged like 5th or 6th on the team, but you must remember, sprinting is not my forte.  In fact, its the part I suck at.  I don't know the distance, so I don't know how good my times were, but they were better than many people's.  My Times: 1:54, 1:50, 1:54, 1:56. (I hope it was a mile.)  I think I fucked up my right leg running that thing.  It doesn't hurt really, but it had the weirdest fuckin' feeling ever.  I don't know, but its gone now.  I saw Tim stumble and slow down on the fourth time.  I hope he didn't hurt himself.  I heard Kansas fell down once.  I find that extremely funny.  "It's only funny when it happens to Kansas".  Then stretch and go home.  Whoooo...  I looked at the times from the EMU Invitational, and the 15th place time from last year was like 18:15.  If you don't know, I really want to place top 15 in EMU.  Its our first meet of the year, so I hope I can run well enough.  That would be the most awesome thing if I could actually win something at a race that's not a Baja Bean shirt.  But I admit, it is a cool shirt.  In fact, I'm wearing it right now.  Yesterday, I spent an hour and a half finishing my AP History summer work that was due on August 2nd and August 9th.  Oh well, I don't care.  Futhermore, I think summer work due over the summer is the gayest idea I've ever heard.  Just last year, the same teacher had it due on the first day of school, like all the non-psychotic assholes.  I think I'm going to hate this guy.  I still have a book to read (Sparknotes) and write a report on.  And a bunch of index cards.  I only have 10 days to do all that.  Shit.  Brad leaves in 9 days, and school starts in 10.  Is that good or bad, or do they cancel each other out.  "Why they're both good, because when school starts, you'll get to see all your friends again! (Holy shit, that's the stupidest thing I ever heard!!!  Anyone who says that [and means it] should have their eyes ripped out and stabbed with a flaming dagger.)  Well, I've done enough ranting for one day, so I'll see ya.  Or not, I don't give a shit.  ...And take your mail back to town!

      Haulass Hyena!   Today's practice was really very nice and good.  Scott and Coble came finally.  Basically, we ran for 50 minutes today, so it does NOT make a smashing film.  I started running with Coulton, but he ended up dropping out at 25(?) minutes, so I was left to finish the run by myself.  Anyway, sometime during the first 20 minutes the girls were having a slacking party that took 5 of us to bust up.  Stupid slackers.  I found out how much I like to yell at them.  Only a whole lot!!!  I even got Amanda to yell at Scott (take that Scott).  Yeah, it was just a normal 50 minutes of running, nothing really special.  Its not a good story is it?  Just a bunch of wasted words.  And there is nothing else to talk about, because I'm writing this in the morning when I haven't done anything yet.  I really need to wait untill night to do this.  Oh well, I guess its your loss.  Hahaha, losers.   Zero tolerance?  Let the bastard leave!  No big thing, cuz he's just bad seed.

      Killer in the neighborhood never got caught...  I finally saw some focus from the team today.  Still no Shawn, Clayton, Scott, or the Cobles, but who needs 'em?  Practice was fairly hard today, but it was a good workout.  After warm-up/stretching etc. we headed down to the course.  Coach split us into groups (fast and slow/girls) and we had a 20 minute indian run.  Michael said "I'm not from Fort, I don't do 'Indian' runs" (hahaha very funny).  My group had Lich, Brandon, me, Coulton, Tim, and Stephen.  It was a fast pace, and the others were willing to work for once.  Towards the end, Tim and Stephen ended up dropping out.  Coulton stuck with the rest of us, which is great, especially for a freshmen.  He's got talent and he's willing to work.  He will be so good a few years down the line (Hell, he's pretty good now).  Our top 5 is starting to be defined already, and I'm looking at 3rd, which is all I could really ask for with Lich and Brandon up there.  Then we rested for a few minutes and went to the field behind the elementary school.  Coach had set up some poles to run around out there, but there was a catch.  We started at the bottom of the hill there, and ran up it, went around the pole, and then went down.  Just to make it interesting, there were 11 poles.  Therefore, we had to run up the hill 11 times, then we (this is the fun part) turned around and ran the same thing again.  So we ran up a hill 22 times nonstop.  Pain! Pain in the glavin!  Everyone was working hard, and it was great to see such uh... (he can't think of the word)...hard work (brilliant, asshole).  I was suprised though.  In fact, I was shocked.  We finally had some devotion from one of our girls (holy shit, that never happens!).  On the hill "exercise" Amanda beat all but 4 of our guys (no, she did not beat me).  If only we had a team for her...  So then, walk back yadda yadda strech yadda yadda yadda, and I'm pretty tired today.  Nothing doing aside from that, so I'll probably sleep about 6 hours today.   Stay tuned to witness the end of this thrilling (good one) story.

      Well, even less of a turnout today. Lich and Akash weren't there, among others, but Stephen showed up.  Only Leah and Amanda showed up for the girls (this is getting pathetic).  I asked Leah if she knew where the others were.  She said Alison is working, Emily is in Richmond, and Kansas "probably decided to sleep in".  I almost feel sorry for the girls who do show up.  Almost.  Anyway, I got there late, and the team had already taken off on warm-up.  So, I went to find them.  Of course, I had no luck until I caught a glimpse of them heading back to the cross country tree.  So, I came running in while they were beginning to strech.  Damn.  Then we went 20 minutes on a rope run.  Not the one I was talking about yesterday, it was easier.  Coach had the fast group, Brandon, me, Tim, Coulton, and Stephen (Lich wasn't there) and made us stick together on a run by having us hold onto a short rope being pulled by Brandon.  It was supposed to be a fast pace, but it wasn't.  Pretty easy.  Then an even easier 30 minute run.  Nothing special.  But, after we strecthed was when it got interesting.  I presented the shirt designs Tim and I came up with (Tim had to leave) to everybody.  I brought in our shirt in grey, white, maroon, and black.  Everyone voted on which one they liked best.  3 for grey, 6 for white, 2 for maroon, and 1 for black.  So we're going to order the white shirts, and Brandon's "Clifton's Crew" will be our maroon long- sleever.  A couple people went home after that, but the rest, including me, stayed to paint the course.  We sprayed a bunch of crazy stuff on there.  I wanted to sprayed "SD interCourse" somewhere but I knew we would get in some deep shit for that one.  That took a while, and then we finally went home.  And did nothing.                                                                                  THE END

      I just got home from practice.  Yes, practice, not conditioning anymore.  It was great to see everyone again, but there weren't many people there at all.  In fact, I think everyone got a haircut while I was gone.  The girls only had 3 people there, and were really only expecting 2 more.  It looks bad for them already.  So we ran about 1 to 1.5 miles on a warm-up, then 2.5 or so on a follow-the-leader run.  Then another 3 running on the course.  So, 7 miles+ today, nothing too bad.  The warm-up was like a normal warm-up.  10 mins. of easy jogging.  It seemed Kansas was having trouble keeping up.  Wow.  In the follow-the-leader, we ran about 20+ mins, with everyone taking 2 minute shares as the leader.  The leader was supposed to do whatever (usually waving their arms about) and everyone followed.  I love that work out, but nobody was really doing it.  It made me mad, because it's an easy, somewhat fun activity, and nobody tried.  Stupid assholes.  Then the course run.  The goal for the cross country course was for the guys to finish in 25 mins, and the girls in 30.  So, only Tim, Coulton, and myself finished under 25.  Lich and Brandon were trying to pace the pack.  I don't know about the girls, but I don't think they made it.  Oh well, sucks for them.  Shawn, Coble, Coble Jr., Chris, Clayton, and Scott didn't show up, but Jeremy Grant finally decided to run.  On the girl's side, Alison and Emily weren't there.  Well, 3/5 isn't bad (Hahahaha).  No, I'm serious (Holy shit that's bad).   We're getting ready to order shirts, and the only design, which is Brandon's, sucks.  I'm going to come up with one of my own, but I have to do it today.  Tim made a picture of the Fort Defiance Indian with a bloody hatchet through it's head.  It's funny as hell.   Anyway, Coach says we're going to do our "rope workout" sometime next week.  This is why I've been training so hard.  I'm going to pull the damn rope!  For those who don't know, this workout consists of tying a rope around the waist of the top 3, and giving the end to the corrosponding 4-6 runners.  1-4, 2-5, and 3-6 are "partners".  Then the top 3 sprints off on a fast 800 pace while the bottom guys have to keep up without letting go of the rope.  If they have to drop the rope, I'm sure there's probably some kind of punishment involved.  Last year, I got stuck running with Lich's rope.  Laugh?  I thought I'd die.  This year, though, I'll be pulling someone.  I volunteered Coulton to be my partner, to which he said "I don't like the sound of this".  This is the part where I'd tell you what I did today non-running related, but since its 10:30 AM, I have done nothing, and will probably do the same throughout the day.  Get lost.

       Finally Freaking Home!!     No running Saturday or Sunday, because I really didn't get the chance.  Frankly, I didn't feel like it anyway.  I'm just tired of sleeping in the basement, showering in the world's worst shower, and having no TV.  Shit.  For the first time after vacation, I am 100% glad to be home.  Vacation sucked, it wasn't planned at all.  My summer peaked in July at running camp, and now I will use from now until school (August 23?) to finish summer work etc.  I am enthusiastic about going to practice tommorow just to see some of my teammates again.  The others can just drop dead (you know who you are) for all I care.  So I tried the new official Olympic Powerade.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  I really have nothing to say, because nothing happened.  Oh well.    Nomar Garciaparra is now a Cub!!!    Fuckin' sweet!!!

      Still in New Hampshire, yet again with Jacob here.  So yesterday I ran for 46 mins.  I took a long, slow day.  I figured I better rest a little since practice "officially" starts on Monday.  I felt good, no calf pain yesterday.  I used the run to work on my running form.  I must say, I'm starting to figure it out.  I actually enjoyed running for a long time, despite I had to run up the second-largest hill in the state next to Mt. Washington.  OK, that's a  small   exaggeration.  Someone spray painted "phew!" and a smiley-face on the top of the hill on the road.  That's about how I was feeling then.  I probably only would have lost a few seconds walking up the hill but...  Anyway, there were two hot girls on the way, so that really helped.  I'm getting the hang of it, I know it.  Then earlier today, I ran for 42 mins.  It was another long, slow day.  Pretty much the same as yesterday, no pain, feel good, working on my form...  I ran into another giant hill today, which was actually larger (not as steep) as the first one.  I turned around when I reached the top.  Good view.  Not much else to say.  Tommorow,  I'll probably run a shorter distance, then rest on Sunday.  That's when I make my triumphant return to Virginia.  First I'd like to reply to Brad's insult (he said my log is like jizz).  So Brad="you is a froot loop".  Vacation has picked up as the week goes on, but I still have the strange desire to return to Virginia, (I'm as suprised as you are!), and I don't know why.  I am not looking forward to riding 11-14 hours in the car back to Virginia.  It will suck, like Brad's running log.  You may insult it here:  urlLink http://bradoneilisfasterthanmost.blogspot.com  Go now and make fun of it!  Jacob sez: "In the first six letters of Virginia, it spells 'virgin',".  Almost home, I know you can't wait.  Haha, yea right.  Smell ya later, asswipe.

      Due to the limited access to computers I have in New Hampshire, I am once again combining many days of running into one.  First of all, I understand Brad has made fun of my log in his log.  So I am going to make fun of him and his log in my log for making fun of my log.  Brad's log is like shit, it stinks real bad when left in the toliet for several days, and turns the water brown.  And if it was in an ugly and stupid contest, it would win.  ...or lose, whichever's funnier.  Now to the running part.  On Monday and Tuesday, I ran for 30 mins.  I didn't feel like running.  And since I didn't feel like running, I ran very poorly.  On Tuesday, I ran on a tree-lined dirt road, similar to Shenandoah Acres, named Upper Road.  I turned around after 15 mins. and ran back to the house for the other 15.  Today I ran the same path, except this time I ran to the end of the road, ran up a steep hill, down a long driveway, then turned around and went back.  This time, I had enough ambition to run well.  I figured out that I beat Tuesday's pace by 1:31.  So basically, I ran faster even though I ran about 10 mins. longer.  I'm starting to get back into it, which is good, because my first full day back is the first day of real practice.  While vacation is getting alot better, I'm still looking forward to returning to the team (Even though I hate most of them).  So the last few days have been cool.  I went out on Squam Lake, the origin of my mom's license plates, everyday.  I went boating/swimming/fishing with my Uncle Kevin.  Kevin looks like George Carlin, except younger.  It's so awesome.  We also went to a planetarium in Manchester.  It was cool in it's own way.  I've found a great area in the basement of the cottage to hit a tennis ball against a wall.  It's been getting better.  I've found time to run and do vacationy stuff, yet think and relax at the same time.  In fact, I've made an important desicion.  But that's enough for today.  Tune in next time when you'll hear the crusty old librarian say, "Quiet!  People are trying to read!", the crusty old soda jerk say, "Root Beer or Cola?", and the crusty old running log writer say, "Hey big man, let me hold you a dollar!".

      So here we are, in New Hampshire.  I have done no running at all thus far, which has only been two days.  Vacation sucks so far, as we have only done one vacation-like thing since arriving Saturday.  Brad and I went swimming for like 20 mins.  The rest of the time has been crappy.  I'm writing on my grandmother's computer,(who is in the hospital), with my cousin, Jacob.  And he's like "yea" and "awesome" and "yay".  Brad ran 10 miles earlier today, which makes my 0 miles look bad.  (He's always making me look bad).  Good thing he's going to college.  If you are reading this, you are probably having more fun than I am.  Therefore, you suck.
