      Today is not a special day... but then i don't seem to be having very many special days, so ..... i guess that today was no different from others... Just got news from my boss that we will be working on a new project soon. Can't really tell too much about it here, but i guess the next few months are going to be pretty hard.  This year I am preparing for CAT again, so i do have a feeling that i am not going to have much leisure in the months to come. Last time CAT was good, but I missed on the last few steps.. here's hoping that this year will be smooth all the way. just talked to my friend Pritam .... i hope you know him.... Pritam Parija... my friend and partner... well he got his marching orders from TCS... will be joining training from early next month. One less friend around the city.... but then it's probably not such a bad thing after all. Forgive me if I'm blabbing. Here's wishing Pritam loads of luck for his new job... and for his special friend who seems to good to be true.... Watched Kalyan Singh taking oath of office and secrecy as the Cm of UP. I wondered as I saw him, what the world was coming to. Wonder how much he paid the BJP MLA's to defect. But judging by the looks of it, wasn't much probably... They were literally falling over themselves in return for a Ministerial berth. Maybe if I don't get a better thing to do, I'll probably join politics... I seem to have all the requisites... not that there are too many... Okay .. so until my next post... which will be pretty soon.... good bye and God Bless !!  And oh !! before i forget we will be shifting to our new home sometime next month. Will let you folks know about it...

      Hi folks, The past week was witness to a really fantastic event. All of you should have known about it, but I wonder why none of the several news channels even bothered to mention it. Last week we had a meteor strike in Orissa.  Well it was huge, really huge. Imagine this, it is evening (around 6:30 pm) and suddenly the sky goes white. What would be you reaction? A fire cracker or maybe the ubiquitous electric transformer bursting perhaps. But what would you think, if your friend in another city, about 40kms away also saw the same thing at the same moment…. Actually that is exactly what happened. I was talking to my friend in another city when all of a sudden we see the sky turning white. We immediately knew that it was surely some kind of meteor strike. I remember waiting for the sound of the impact, but there was none. Later we learned that what we had seen had been the meteor entering the Earth’s atmosphere. It traveled about 200 kms within moments and landed at a place called Mayurbhanj, gutting a few houses. Apparently, no one was killed, but some folks were knocked out by the sound blasted. So that was some excitement in an otherwise mundane week. And by the way, India beat Pakistan in the Asian Cup hockey finals. Now THAT’S always a reason to celebrate.

      Hi people, Sometimes I wonder if anybody ever reads all the stuff that I post on this site. Maybe I am wasting my time. But then someone like you comes along and makes it all worth it. Somebody who actually reads the stuff that I post. Okay, so what has been happeneing since I last posted ? Well a few things did crop up.  Firstly work is really getting hectic and my boss is resembling a former Nazi leader with a tooth brush moustache. But it really is exciting, this new project that we are working upon. we have called our project, PROJECT DISHA. Disha stands for direction. What we basically intend to do is to provide a direction to the restless enrgies of the youth today. Other than that I have almost fully recovered from the blast from the past. Had a good discusson with a certain person, last night about it, and am feeling much better now. I have decided that I'm not going to let her hurt me the way she hurt me the last time. My carrer is to important to me to mess around with it. Besides what really put me at ease was what this person told me. He told me that the worst case scenario was that I should come face to face with her. NOw that I think about it, it really is no big deal. Besides she was the one who ditched me, and if anybody should be afraid of this meeting it should be her than me.  But that person also told me something else. Something which I really believed in but had overlooked pehaps. WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON..... Wonder what that means.... Okay gotta run folks. Hope you will come back and read more of me. Besides I am planning to upgrade my site soon. so watch out for an all new MALOYVILLA.

      Life's good. I mean that for the last few days, things have going pretty smooth. My work is going okay. We work hard and play harder. In fact I am having such a great time that very few things bother me nowadays.  So much so that when the person that I had tried so hard to forget is making a comeback in my life and it is not bothering me. Maybe its because that this person was one day my biggest strength, and today she is my biggest weakness. A person whom I couldn't stay without seeing for a day, today I can't stand to meet her. Maybe its because I have changed a lot.  Maybe its as much my fault as her that it didn't work out. A relationship which lasts 7 years and then never ends .... is as much my fault as hers. Maybe if I had tried a bit more.... maybe... But I will have to spend my life saying " Maybe......  Apart from that, and the fact that I was able to take this unexpected bolt... Things are swell. Just had this mail from a cousin... who recieved it from a paramour... hope you people  like it.... I am sure all of you will feel that you can identify with it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end, Yet the days go by and weeks rush on, And before I know it, a year is gone. And I never see my old friends face, For life is a swift and terrible race, He knows I like him just as well, As in the days when I rang his bell. And he rang mine but we were younger then, And now we are busy, tired men. Tired of playing a foolish game, Tired of trying to make a name. "Tomorrow" I say! "I will call on Jim Just to show that I'm thinking of him." But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes, And distance between us grows and grows. Around the corner, yet miles away, "Here's a telegram sir," "Jim died today." And that's what we get and deserve in the end. Around the corner, a vanished friend. Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell them. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what They mean to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time it might be too late. Seize the day. Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Hi people, Do you all believe in love. well, I believe in love too.... but sometimes, it so happens that my faith becomes wobbly. In time like this I go to Anne and Jisnu. Who are Anne and Jisnu ? Well they were my batch mates in engineering college. They were one of the numerous "COUPLES" which wre formed within the first few months. But the important thing is that ... while many of these broke apart within the next few months, these twoo people are going to get married early next year. Now that's what makes them special as far as i am concerned. I meet them in order to convince myself that Love does exist.. ... it really is upto us to find it. Sometimes it happens that we meet sombody whom we assume to be our true love, but later it doesn't turn out that way. In such times we tend to believe that there is no such thing as true love. But it is not so. It does exist. Just bcause we met the wrong person who did not deserve to be our partner, it doesn't mean that love doesn't exist. It just means that we have to look harder to find it. I hope that all of you find your true love wherever you are. And I pray to the Lord that I may too do so.  Fall all those who believe in love, I have started a new Yahoo group caled Have Faith in Love. Please join the group and spread the message. The link is  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/havefaithinlove/

      Hi There,  Things are pretty easy here… in spite of all the work that has been going on. The day is 12 of September and life feels good.  I have been feeling pretty low after Pritam left for TCS, but since he is obviously getting along okay. Just for the record, it’s purely platonic feelings for him, I mean. Well why do I have to clarify ?? Well, seems that nobody can be trusted nowadays… just heard from a friend that her closest friend( another girl ), had suddenly developed some SPECIAL feelings for her which weren’t purely friendly. You can’t be too safe anywhere, can you…? Other then that, Debi called up. Debi who? Well he is one of my closest friends from college. We were pretty close together. Our group was mainly Debi, DD, AD and me. We shared some pretty good time together. We had lost touch with Debi some time back, but it was great to hear from him.  Besides, workload is heavy at the office and it’s getting pretty hard to balance things, but I am managing. Not much else really to say… Good bye and God Bless

      Hi junta,  It’s 9/11/2003 and it has been two years since four airliners were hijacked and used as weapons of destruction against people of the best nation of the world. Okay so many of you might think that the attack was as much the result of  American foreign policy as it was the megalomania of a deranged terrorist, but really there can be no justification for the hideous crime against humanity. Besides have you ever pondered a moment about why it was America that was chosen for this attack? Why not, say, India or China... which are arguably large enough economies and military powers, an attack on whom would have had more disastrous effects.  I think the reason for the choice was that the USA has stood up against these terrorists. It is the only country which has refused to negotiate with them or for that matter even tolerate them. I think it’s a much better policy than to accept terrorism as a part of our lives and learn to live with it….. as the people of India have been forced to do by a lack luster government. The resilience demonstrated by Mumbaikars on getting back on their feet after the recent terror attack is commendable. Almost as commendable as the lack of any coherent response by the government was deplorable. Just punishing the pawns in this deadly game is not enough. What we did is just reassure our people that the next time the terrorists strike, we will pick up the pieces much faster and probably sentence a few people before waiting for the next one. That I am afraid is not what the people elected these leaders for.

      Hi people, Some things never change.... things like ministers in UP, our fate at WTO and the fact that I like posting on my site. So here's my latest post. Some things have actually changed since I last posted. Well, for starters, i have once less firend in this city, because my friend Pritam left for Trivandrum and TCS training last week. He has called a few times and his stories seem to oscillate between multicoloured LUNGIS and topless women. So I really don't know what to say to that. I am sure he is enjoying himself. Best of luck !! Buddy... Nearer to home, two very significant things have happened, firstly, remember the project that I referred to in my last post, well it has been approved. What that means is that being the Project Manager, I will have very little time to spare for the next few weeks... maybe months. Which brings me to my next point, which is that the Sims have started at IMs, so even Sundays are no longer fun days. It's going to be really difficult to juggle between these two things, both important, both critical. Other than that... not much has been happening, except that it's probably finalized that we will be shifting to our new house by the end of this month. And here's a speciall message to all those people who can't chat with the people they would like to because, Yahoo Messengers are not allowed in offices, please feel free to use the chatroom, that i have added to my site. This is my small tribute to pining hearts all around me... I wish I had somebody who pined for me... someday...

      Hello and welcome back to my updates.  Okay I wanna ask all you people a simple question. This is something that has come to my mind when i was talking to this person. The question is simple   What is a better approach to life ? 1. Have a negative outlook, and always expect the worst. That way you will never be dissappointed. 2. Have a positive outlook, and expect the best. But you also risk being disappointed when things don't go your way.   This is not as simple as it looks at first sight. Think about this people,  and please mail me at maloy_mail@rediffmail.com and let me know.   And yes, CAT is only a week away. wish me luck all of you and PRAY FOR ME...

      Hi folks, Thanks for reading my updates... The reason that I wirte these updates is that people like you actually read them. Well I would like to apologize for the last few updates which have been very sketchy, to say the least. You are probably thinking that I must have suddenly lost my marbles to put stuff like this on the net. But you people have to realise that the last few weeks have been very exciting and have caused a churn in my life. It's really something that has changed the way I look at life and the way I approach it. Life doesn't give everybody a second chance. A second attempt to do what I had not done the last time around. A second chance to correct all the mistakes of the past. I am thankful to the Lord Of The Rings  for giving me this chance. I know that the last time I was not wrong. I was a nice guy then and if anything, I am a better person now. I just dont think I am. I know I am. So I am sure that this time I will fare better than last time.  The last time, I had everything within my grasp. I still don't know why I lost it. I don't really want to know. Maybe it was because God wanted me to do it better this time. I am sure that there has been some serious value addition to my profile since last time. I know that this time I am a much better option than I was last time, and that one who rejected me last time, won't have any reason to do so this time. But yes, I also know that nothing is confirmed. Nothing is taken for granted. I don't know what the future holds for me and so I am surely not a bit complacent. But there is a sort of quite calm. The anxiety and the unsecurity that was within me last time, and which I believe was a major reason for my failure last time, is surely not around this time. Instead there is this quiet calm. A sort of silent confidence that this time there is some power behind me which will ensure my success.  Whenever I talk of God, people start rolling their eybrows and start thinking "Okay... here he goes again...." But really, I am so sure that the Lord is with me this time. I talk to him all the time. When I say that to people, they think that I am just saying it for the effect. BUt if fact, I am not talking through my hat. It's just the interpretation of the word God. What I call God, some call conscience, others call it the inner voice. It exists in all of us in some form or other. Some people like me entrust thir entire lives to it, while other just choose to ignore it. So it is this voice, this God, which inspires in me confidence that I am going to crack CAT this year. I am not going to spoil this second shot at success.

       THE POWER OF "O"  A single O could have changed the world ... but it was not to be.. Strange isn't it ? Well it wasn't really all that bad since I probably was getting too excited about nothing... but then a bit of harmless fun never hurts any body .. sorry for the inconvinience to anybody...

      Hi folks, The last few days have been very very exciting. I don't really wanna talk much about it, because people feel that if I spend too much time thinking about it then I might screw up the other more important things in my life. Not that I believe in that...  I beleive that this is my biggest strength rather than a weakness... But yes, I am willing to listen to other this time, simply because I don't want them complaining that I didn't listen.  I am not in a position to commit, nor do I know what the future holds for us... I just know that I want you to be happy...  Wonder what they mean...  Some day I will know... Salvation in 22 days... some may agree, some may disagree, none can ignore..... Someday looking back at this post, I will wonder why I ever put this online. today I'm just glad that I am doing this. If you are reading this and it doesn't make sense to you... don't worry, it's not meant to be.  This is me all alone....

      Hello people, It's great to be able to post again on my site. I mean that the last week has been so much fun, that it's hard to believe that it's been only a week since CAT was cancelled. I don't remember whether I have posted my views on the entire episode, but here's what I think of the matter.  I think that the fact that CAT has been busted and that the culprits are behind bars, does ensure that those folks who would have got admission into an IIM solely on the basis of a killer score( courtesy LEAKED QUESTIONS) will be weeded out. I think that will pave the way for some fair competition at the GD/PI round.  Okay, so I hear you wonder how much of a difference that it's going to make. Apparently, quite a bit. Ask any one who has been associated with any IIM and he will tell you that there ARE donkeys along with horses in the IIMs. So now we know where the donkeys come from. Okay apart from that, life has been just swell. I never have had life so good. For the first time in many years I have been really happy. It's almost as if this was the only part missing. A single person has come into my life and made my whole life more meaningful.  Had a great last weekend. Pritam was back in town for the weekend, from his gruelling training session at TCS. So we got together and had a great time... Shiva, Pritam and me. Had a bit of a misunderstanding with this really nice person, but no real harm done since things were sorted out easily. Also had a great lunch. So until next time....  TAKE CARE FOLKS....

       THE NEW YEAR BLOG  Good Morning people and a very Happy New Year to all of you... So I have taken a long time to post this message. But you guys have to understand that I have been busy. I spend 4 hours a day on an average on the telephone. Besides I work and study. So I am busy. But this is not new. I have probably had a similar schedule for the last 2 years. What is new is that I am actually enjoying it. And the reason that I am doing so is that the only girl that I have ever loved is back in my life after many years.  I will let you know the details in my next post. My boss just walked in and I have to run. HAPPY NEW YEAR again...

      Hi people, It's really hot in here... The city is scorching.. don't be too carried away, all i am talking about is the weather... We are going through some really hot times. it's soaring mercury levels at around 40C.... And the fact that I don't really have much to do is not much of a comforting thought since I seem to have more tim to kill.  After the excitement of the last few months, both on the career and emeotional front, things seem to have settled down.... Pritam is back to his job and seems to have his hands full.... As for me, I am now bracing up for a tough two years.... by the way, I have a new cell number... 94370-95802. It's too hot to be doing something for such a long time.... even if it's just posting messages... so see you guys... BTW, before I sign off, Yesterday was the birthday of a very special person, and although it had a lot of glitches, I think it was one of the most memorable days of my life.... SAYONARA FOLKS....

      Hi folks, Had my first quiz today. We will surely have lots more of these quizzes, but the shock of the first one shall be difficult to match; Impossible to better. It was declared when we least expected, last evening. The expressions on the faces of the students, when they heard the news for the first time was worth a thousand words.... not all of them pleasant. But then, such is the charisma of the man, that there were no questions asked. Everybody knew and expected a bad day, and he did not disappoint. Okay, maybe I am being a bit harsh on him, the test was not THAT bad. The questions were pretty easy, the answers were a whole different ball game.  But this first quiz, did give us an idea about what to expect in the next two years. I am waiting for the 12:00 am class lecture, he conducts one of them every year. The results are going to be out sometime soon and then, maybe even before that, we would have had many more tests and presentations.  But then, as one prof rightly put it, we are here to work and they are going to ensure that we are not disappointed. MALOY

      There are several stages in a person's life..... Some of which are really quite new learning experiences.... Last week, at this time, I was at home trying to decide which movie I would watch before going to bed, and to day I am only 5 kms away.  5 kms.... seems a lot more than that. In the last few days, i have made lots of friends, some of their names, i don't even know yet...  some others, I know...  Last night we had our first experience of Intro with our seniors... Can't really say what happened... It's out of the rules... Will get back asap... See you Maloy

      hi people, Its been a long time since I have posted on this site. Well the big change in my status is that I will be joining the PG progrmme for XIMB 2004-06. So after almost two years I will be back on campus as a student again. I will be joining campus by the middle of this month. I have heard a lot about the MBA programme and the associated life and this is really going to be an exciting time. I am looking forward to get some real work done in the next few years. Other then that, not much is happening around here. For all those people from Bhubaneswar, who have been outside for sometime, you guys will be glad to know that thhings are changing really fast. We have our first mall, disco, PlanetM, Cafe Coffee Day outlet and a lot more places to hang out here already. aAnd things are changing really fast. There is talk about Airtel launching it's service here and both Barrista, Inox and Pizza Hut will be opening outlets soon. So finally after all these years of lagging behind in obscurity, the city is finally coming of age. Sometimes I wonder why I bother to post anything on this site. I wonder does anybody ever read this, why the hell am I wasting my time. But just as I am going to give this up, somebody like you comes around and makes all this worth it. So please take a moment and leave me a message to let me know that you were here and your thoughts on me and my site. N.B. I HAVE CHANGED OPERATORS AND MY NEW CELL NUMBER IS 94370 95802. Until later then..... MALOY
