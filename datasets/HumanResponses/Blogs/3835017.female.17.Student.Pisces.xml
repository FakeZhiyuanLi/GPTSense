      Name: Garakuta Dango Age: 16 Gender: Female Birthday: [will be updated] Sign: [will be updated]  Appearance: Dango has a deep terracotta-colored which is pulled back into two low pig-tails and wrapped like Yuna's from X-2 with bangs and hair framing her face, which brings out her pale, sparkly blue eyes. She's about 5'5" tall and is rather lean. She wears a brown leather tubetop and a low-cut leather skirt with gold circles embedded throughout the hem, gheta sandals, and her hands, forearms, feet, and lower legs are wrapped in bandages. Accessory-wise, she sports a brown leather choker-thing, two arm-things that are tied by a leather wrapping on the left arm and her hitai-ate around her right arm, a pair of earrings that are like two spiked mace-balls, and a triangle tattoo-design underneath her left eye. She is always surrounded by a mischevious and upbeat air, which adds to the sparkle of her natural youth. Also, she also lives very animatedly, so she sports a rather tomboy-ish impish look to her.  For a better picture, check out http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/8790233/ .  Personality: Dango is a very animated and lively individual. When she was little, she was very attentive, quiet, and obeyed her grandmother, the matriarch of the clan, very well. However, after recent tension, Dango decides to live her own life and sprints down the other path. Now, she is a very open individual who lives for herself and for those who she respects. She judges people by their actions done in their presence, not by rumors. She's loud and honest, like Naruto, but won't bluntly challenge everyone in a room like he did during the first test in the chuunin exam...^-^; She's a partier and loves to have fun, often setting aside her studies to get a kick out of life. However, she is a very feisty person and gets extremely nasty really fast once you piss her off.She goes psychotic at this point, though not to the point of Tsuyu, and doesn't calm down until her goal is either complete or until she's knocked out.  History: When she was a baby, a man named Anzai found her in a muddy ditch and took her home with him to be raised by the Kobarashi clan. During her childhood years, her grandmother Ibana, who was the clan matriarch. insisted that she train Dango herself and, when the tactician master Anzai insisted on teaching tactics, refused and explained that Dango must grow up to be a woman and study the geisha arts instead of grow up to be a brutish tomboy. She was kept inside until she just turned 8, and then was just allowed to go to the academy. Because of this seclusion, the only thing that she knows about the Kyubi incident was that a demon was "looking for a princess" and she had to stay inside; she has no idea of the fourth Hokage's existence.  Right before her ninth birthday, she became a gennin and only got a month in before her grandmother became ill and needed her help at home. For five years, as Dango tended to her grandmother, Anzai taught her how to blend her geisha skills her with his tactician training while keeping her in shape through strength training and yoga. When she was 14, her adoptive father left for a peace mission and never came back, leaving Dango with Ibana. It was then that Ibana really got mean, blaming her son's disappearance and his change in personality all on her. Here was when Ibana let Dango know in a rather cross way that Dango wasn't a part of the family and that she was just some whelp found in a ditch. Hearing this, Dango freaked out, rampaged through the house, grabbed her things, and stormed out of the house, changing her clan name from Kobarashi to Garakuta, which means 'odds and ends'.   At 14, Dango moved into a small apartment blessed through child welfare, and joined up with Master Satu's cell, starting her new life as Garakuta Dango.   * I am so sorry if this is unclear and sloppy! I was pressed for time! *

      Name: Kumori Tsuyu Age: 20  Gender: Male  Birthday: september 29 Sign: Libra  Appearance: Tsuyu's most noticable quality would have to be the navy eyes he has that leave all guessing at what his true nature is. He looks innocent enough with the light blue hair that is longer on the right side with the bangs and a loose ponytail in the back. His headband is placed across the forehead like intended with the bangs covering the very sides of the metal and some of the blue. He has a light complexion with a little bit of color, a cloud tattoed on his right shoulder and the anbu sign on the other. He wears the usual anbu outfit with a fishnet trenchcoat covering it, his mask is tied to his thigh and it resembles a wolf. On days he is off duty he is still wearing the trenchcoat and goes between tight tanktops of all colors and just normal cargo pants.  Personality: A basically laid back type of person, he likes to flirt around a bit but ignores getting a real relationship or anything because he has a thing against commitment. It's pretty hard to catch him being nostalgic or even a bit serious about anything no matter how hard you try. Kinda of like a a shield protecting him from any damage he's able to usually keep a smile or at least a slightly pleased look on his face even when he isn't in a good mood. Getting to see him without the shield only proves that he trusts you or you've pissed him off. It's hard to even get a reaction out of him for trivial things unless it pertains to him one way or another. He's a slightly a disagreeable person but when someone does try and fight with his opinion a very harsh "whatever" will most likely escape his lips. Whatever it takes to avoid conflict with someone else and he'll do it, unless it leads down to saying sorry. If he has to he'll avoid the person for the rest of their lifes. Getting him extremely mad isn't something you'd want to do...  History: The Kumori clan has an advanced bloodline that has to deal with a 'second form' type being. It's what would be called a berserker to most, their appearance doesn't change as much as most but it also varies on how angry they get and how pure the blood of the clan is in them. Do to this bloodline and how strong it is in Tsuyu, as a child he grew up with no mother because she died giving birth to him and a father who abused him in almost anyway thinkable. At an early age he was allowed into the academy. This gave him many reasons to stay out of home. the one he took a liking to was training. He'd already learned the basics and soon had to start borrowing scrolls off of his teacher. This brought him to the top of his class and graduation soon followed too. He was extremely young graduating thought, about the age of 9 precisely. Being a ninja was the only way to get away from his father and also became his life. One night, about a month before his first chuunin exam he came home a bit too late. His dad was furious but to what Tsuyu remembers, he was just sent to his room without dinner. The next day he woke up in his own room, soaked completely in what he thought was his own blood. Everytime he moved it hurt. Furthering his inspection because he was curious, he found his father brutally murdered. Nobody was able to figure out how it happened either. So, Tsuyu was sent to live with that of the very own Gekkou Hayate's family. He would have missed the chuunin exam due to grief if a certain sickly boy hadn't persuaded him otherwise. During the exam's individual fights he lost one of his genin team members. Ironically though, he had to fight the same person and went berserk. Even though he made the mistake of losing it he had passed but bore one word of advice, 'control it'. Because of this he feared he'd turn out like his father. From then he forced himself to change into what he is today, a very strong anbu member with complete control over what his clan had lost many years back. Somehow he feels that's the only job he'll be happy with and has been one since he was around 16 (He became a jounin at 15). Everyone was still scared of him though, all except Hayate who turned to be his only friend. Then the tragic day occured when Hayate died. From then on he promised himself to never cry or show he was hurt ever again, all because it didn't seem worth it anymore.  (I just got liz's draft because i finished most..might edit it some)

      Name: Satu Myagi Age: 22 Gender: Male Birthday: January 23rd Sign: Aquarius  Appearance: Satu has long jet black hair and porcelain white skin. His hair dark, butt-length hair is streaked with gold highlights and pulled back into a ponytail of sorts with the use of a claw clip. In the front he has two shorter pieces of hair that fall just under his chin and partially cover his head protector. His torso is bound in several yards of tough, white fabric that acts as a support brace and is moderately resilient against blunt attacks. He also has much smaller strips wrapped around a segment of his upper right arm and lower left arm. Also, on his upper left arm he has the Anbu tattoo from his years among their ranks. On his bottom half he wears dark blue hakama and matching sandals.   Personality: Satu is a hard-working nin. His disposition is normally chipper and friendly, though when in one of his rare bad moods all shall feel his wrath (/bitchiness). Nearly always rational and levelheaded, he often finds himself in the negotiator role should a problem arise along with being the stopper of fights and brawls. Not that he hasn't been known to begin a few himself when he's feeling particularly foul. He's a perfectionist and has a slight obsessive compulsive disorder problem when it comes to cleanliness and organization. For Satu, they are both an absolute must. He would also much rather have one large obstactle to tackle than several smaller ones. Multiple problems springing up tend to grate on his nerves. He's loving and devoted to his friends, and he counts almost everyone in Konohagakure as one until proven otherwise. This spawns mostly from his childhood when his family moved so much that he never had time to make and keep relationships.  History: Satu's parents were both involved in the brutal civil wars of the Hidden Mist Country that were constant until a little over a decade ago. His father, Koji, was unwillingly called to battle due to the fact that he possessed the Myagi bloodline. Chihira, his mother, on the other hand was a nurse at a hospital that was commandeered to be used strictly to heal wounded soldiers. Koji was wounded in a fight at one point and underwent a rather lengthy hospital stay - It was there that he met Chihira. Shortly after the wars finally reached a conclusion the couple married and bore Satu. As a child he and his family spent a good deal of time traveling from one village to the next. Though Satu was never fond of packing up and moving as soon as he'd begun to make friends they didn't have much of a choice: if people were to find out about Koji and Satu being what they were murder would more than likely ensue. It was during Satu's 10th year that they moved by Koji's sister. Not only was she a relative but she even had a son, Haku. Though he was several years younger than Satu they spent nearly every waking hour together. Within a few months they had developed a tight, brotherly relationship. Unfortunately after a little under a year Satu's parents decided to make one final move: they would head for Hidden Leaf Country where he could enroll in the their ninja academy and make a name for himself. Both Haku and Satu were heartbroken despite both of their parents promises that they would meet up again in the future. Afterall both had lived much of their lives alone beforehand, and though Satu was moving to a village Haku was stuck in his families secluded cottage, alone again. Satu's time in Konoha, however, was relatively happy and in time he grew to forget Haku. He had a knack for ninja skills and rapidly devoured all of the information presented to him. He was able to graduate after only two years, and passed the chuunin exams that summer. By the time he was 15 he'd become a jounin and only one year later was he given the opportunity to become an Anbu. He stayed with the Anbu for a little over two years before the stress of it all began to wear away at him and he turned in his resignation. From then on he a jounin sensei for the young genins. It was only recently that he heard news of Haku's death, however. And he took the news rather harshly. He'd rarely thought of his cousin in ages, he'd just assumed he was living happily. Then, after doing a bit of research and learning the circumstances of his death and all that had happened previously he began to blame himself. He felt that if he had kept his word and visited him, had reminded him that he cared, Haku wouldn't have been driven to such a sad life and consequently death.
