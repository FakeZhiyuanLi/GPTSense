      I guess I should be used to never going home on time.  7 to 5 doesn't exist anymore.. 7 to 6 or 7 to 7 is more like it now..  Today wasn't that bad a day.  Still can't stop thinking bout that one who has my heart.  I assisted in the installation of 4 $20,000 projectors to seamlessly put together one data wall in our Multi-Operational Facility.  That was a great project.. Actually it is a great project, far from done, but I'm having fun with it.  I'm probably going to end up working through the weekend.  Money doesn't make me happy, material things only compliment one's life.  I am not going to re-enlist for over $10,000.  It becomes clearer to me what I have waiting for me when my time in service is done.

      Sore throat getting worse.   My boss asks me if I'm gay.  We get off work over an hour late.  The weather just got hella worse.  But I got a Sarah McLachlan CD!  And a stuffed Penguin and more!  WHAT A DAY!!!

      I've had this sore throat since my plane ride on Asiana Airlines.  Maybe it's the stress.  Hmm.......  But I always have a throat problem here in Korea...  But it was gone when I went back in the states.   I know there's some black crap flowing through our ventilation systems here in the dormitory.  I hope that's not what's causing it all.  I really need to get out of here.

      Yesterday was my Valentines Day, and I got two flowers from a friend.  That made me feel better.  I couldn't get my mind off my main squeeze back in the states though.  Happy Valentines Day Sweetheart

       urlLink    Can you see that little bit of cloud poking down from above?  That was a water spout.  Too bad I couldn't get a better picture.  It was fully developed when I saw it in my rear view mirror.  Sirens went off when it started to fade.......

       urlLink    Same day, but at night.  This guy was chilling 5 feet from my door.  He's a harmless one.  They call him a ground snake.  I live on the third floor, so I called him lost.
