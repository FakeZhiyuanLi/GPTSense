      There's one thing that the church is in desperate need of today - fresh thinkers!  I've heard it said that our methods should always change, but our message should not. I wonder. It seems that if you discuss spirituality with people who are not followers of Jesus, a profound insight surfaces. Most non-followers of Jesus do not see anything fresh, relevant, or compelling about our message of "faith".  For the most part, "Christianity" is perceived as a worn out religious world view, with not much worthy of exploration by a generation thirsting for the spiritual.  I believe that's why we need fresh prophets, poets and theologians who are approaching the story of God from a different perspective - and one of the people who I think is on the leading edge of a church culture change is  urlLink Brian McLaren . When I first read  urlLink A New Kind of Christian , I was thinking "YES! This is what I've been thinking and feeling for a long, long time." I was hooked. I just finished reading  urlLink The Story We Find Ourselves In , which was flat out amazing [both are a must read]! Both books have been foundational for so many people who are seeking to architect a new church culture.  It was cool to find out that Brian was here in town teaching, so a group of us headed out and heard him this morning at Capo Beach Calvary. Great time. Challenging thoughts. He spoke on the feeding of the five thousand as a reminder that we are called to turn our attention outside the circle of disciples, and gain a God perspective - on needs, on our involvement, and the fact that Jesus is the bread for a hungry world. Very sweet. If you ever get a chance to read any of Brian's stuff - you'll not regret it!  After the service, we did what every person should... hit  El Molino de Oro  for some authentic breakfast burritos. For those of you who live in South Orange County - you know what I'm talking about!

       urlLink    earlier this month, jamie and i had the opportunity to travel to prague, czech republic.  it was an amazing week!  we spent three days exploring the city, and another three teaching at the international baptist theological seminary just outside prague.  together we explored evangelism, followership, and teaching with the emerging culture.  we made great friends, enjoyed some great conversations, and took in the sights of this amazing city.  thanks to all who welcomed us with open arms - even the crazy canadians!&nbsp; urlLink

      if there's one thing that's for sure, it's that life is a more of a journey, than a destination.  for far too many of us, we are living our lives for a destination - as if we're waiting and hoping for something to happen in the future.  we see our faith as a ticket to get on the bus to some spiritual destination.  so we see this life as a bus stop, and we're waiting for the bus to come. life is more than that. it's about the story that's being written and how our story fits into the greater story of God.  sometimes we look at the current chapter we are in and wonder - God is this how life will be?  it seems like life is like for that our family right now.  we're faced with a possible ending of one chapter and an opening of a new one.  one thing's for sure, life is a series of chapters being written - some good, some tough.  the key for us is to keep our focus on the larger story, and the reality that someday God will re-tell our story in all it's completeness and then we'll see it, the fullness of our lives, every chapter in place.  the final re-telling will be the re-membering of our fragmented lives into a beautiful mosaic of grace and love.  God has taken our family on an amazing journey - from twelve years at yorba linda friends church, to youthbuilders, to planting south county united - our church in mission viejo.  what will be next, no clue...  but we know the author of the story - the one who re-tells our stories.  he is good.

      More stuff from Thomas Merton's book  urlLink Opening the Bible ...    "We have to recognize that those for whom the Bible has become a habit may well defraud themselves of deeper understanding by deciding in advance what they want of the Bible and what it wants of them. They go to the Bible knowing in just what ways it suits them. They dig in to satisfy their own needs - and of course they are not wrong. But the Bible is not merely to satisfy our needs or to&nbsp;give us what suits us...&nbsp;   It may be supremely disconcerting, ambiguous, even frightening. It may shock our reason into unbelief, and we may have to struggle with it as a scandal."  [p. 36]    "There is, in a&nbsp;word, nothing comfortable about the Bible - until we manage to get so used to it that we make it comfortable for ourselves. But then we are perhaps too used to it and too at home in it. Let us not be too sure we know the Bible just because we have learned not to be astonished at it, just because we have learned not to have problems with it. Have we perhaps learned at the same time not to really pay attention to it? Have we ceased to question the book and be questioned by it? Have we ceased to fight it? Then perhaps our reading is no longer serious. For most people the understanding of the Bible is, and should be a struggle: not merely to find meanings that can be looked up in books of reference, but to come to terms personally with the stark scandal and contradiction in the Bible itself."  [p. 37]   Brilliant.

      I know this may come as a shock to some of you, but I'm really a closet book geek. Yeah, I know that's hard for some of you to believe, but alas it is true. My latest find, via used book store browsing [I introduced Ashdown and others to the way of the used book store] is Thomas Merton's classic  urlLink Opening the Bible . [You know that the brotha is deep and has something worth listening to when the book cover is just a picture of him.] The book was originally a forward to a book that was being edited by Abraham Heschel on the nature of the Scriptures. I just picked it up today to start it and all I can say is - amazing! Not only have I found Merton to be incredible profound and refreshing, the book put into words things I've been thinking for quite a while.  I had a friend of mine told me once that "we as evangelicals suffer from too high a view of Scripture." Namely, that we somehow envision that the Bible just fell out of the sky somewhere and belongs to "another world" far away from our own. Merton picks up on this theme and notes that in order to read the Bible honestly,  "we have to avoid entrenching ourselves behind official positions, whether religious or cultural, whether for or against the Bible itself."  I've been sensing for a while and wondering if  how we read the Bible is more conditioned by our pre-conceived theological position, or our cultural upbringing, than by what God has intended to communicate through the text. It's as if we have not allowed the text a chance to breathe and be free to whisper the mysteries of God to the deepest part of our being.  I've also come to understand lately that we as a "Christian" sub-culture are more addicted to answers than to questions. We're afraid to ask tough questions, and would rather settle for simple answers, thinking that as we amass more and more answers, we are somehow becoming more knowledgeable, and therefore more "spiritual." As Merton comments,  "In the progress toward religious understanding, one does not go from answer to answer but from question to question. One's questions are answered, not by clear, definitive answers, but by more pertinent and more crucial questions."  In the end we find that it is not the text that we are trying to master, but we are being questioned and mastered by the text itself.  I think that in the past few years, as I've explored the faith more deeply and more freely - I have fallen more and more in love with the text, not less. I want to be in the text and have the text be in me. I want to immerse myself in the text and have my life absolutely drenched in it. I don't want easy answers, I want the freedom to ask "more pertinent and more crucial questions." I want the text to breathe... and breathe into me.  More to come.

      I've spent the past two Tuesday nights and Wednesday mornings speaking at Forest Home's Family Camps. Great people and great time to dive into thoughts on passing along spiritual legacy to the next generation.&nbsp; The highlight, though was getting to hang out with Angie and the high school staff at high school camp. I absolutely love what they're doing this summer there. For those of you who think that there are no camps that are exploring new ways of embracing life in Jesus -&nbsp;FH is bringing it!&nbsp;I think Angie is one of more amazing people I know. She's got a great vision for helping students dialogue over the faith, wrestling with what they believe, and not pushing some stale, regurgitated "decision" to "make Jesus your personal Savior and Lord." The camp experience is designed to help students process and talk about their questions, doubts and feelings about God. Flat out one of the best camp experiences I've seen - well worth a look!

      We had a great conversation tonight at our community group about gay marriage. The question was posed of how would Jesus feel and react to the current issue of gay marriage. For most of us, we agreed on the fact that the Church has done a lousy job of acting anything close to what Jesus would be all about in engaging the gay community. It seems that those who call themselves Christ followers, for the most part, look nothing like him. Our rhetoric is filled with condemnation rather that grace - with our dogmatism being displayed on banners and shouted from street corners. There must be something more honoring to the creation of God.   I love what Tony Campolo said in the book  urlLink Adventures in Missing the Point .  "I believe that if Jesus were in our shoes, he would reach out in love to his homosexual brothers and sisters and demand that they be treated justly, that we end the discrimination that has too often made homosexuals into second-class citizens and denied them their constitutional rights. If Jesus were in our shoes, he would work to create an atmosphere in society wherein homosexuals could be open about who they are without fear of oppression and persecution. If Jesus were in our shoes, those with a homosexual orientation would be treated with dignity and respect."    Makes me wonder... what if our rhetoric was replaced with acts of care and concern? Doesn't being a part of the kingdom of heaven mean joining with God in extending love,&nbsp;dignity and respect for the image of God planted in every human being?   Just a thought.

      This just in! This was actually seen on a church marque in Yorba Linda, CA...  " If life's weeds are slowing you down, get a better gardener - God. "  And we wonder why our world doesn't take life in Jesus seriously. Could it be because of utterly stupid things that are said in the name of Jesus? Just a thought!

      I was sitting with  urlLink Jessy  at the Azusa Pacific library today. It was such an energizing conversation. As we talked through her general session that she is doing later this week, we began to talk about questions... and answers. Isn't it intereting that we so often want the answers, yet we are so afraid fo asking questions. Lately, I've becoming more aware that faith, true lasting faith comes from wrestling with the Scriptures, wrestling with life, and asking the questions that are yearning to be asked.  As we sat there, this thought entered our discussion. Answers that are not earned, are rarely ever owned.  If we don't wretle with the questions, I mean truly wrestle with the deeper questions of God and life - our answers ring hollow. I want a faith that is real. I want a faith that meets me in the here and now and is unafraid of questions, and the truth - wherever we may find it!  May we be people who don't settle for easy answers, but wrestle with the text of the Scriptures, with the meaning of life and how we live as followers of Jesus in this world.

      What an amazing night! For the week, I've been at Azusa Pacific University teaching at the Youth Leadership Institute's conference. It's been such a rich time of exploring new territories of the journey of faith and life with these students. I have been so blown away by their maturity and desire to embrace life in Jesus in a real and authentic way.  Tonight for our general session, we explored what it means to embrace our faith not as a ticket to some future event or destination, but rather entering into a new reality of kingdom life in the here and now. What I'm begining to undertand is that our faith is given to us in such futuristic terms. Our faith is about hoping and waiting... for someday, but what about now? I'm com ing to a deep realization that I need a faith for now, not for someday. I need a faith that helps me make sense of life now, makes sense off the journey of my life in the here and now, not "waiting" or "hoping" that someday it will all make sense. The Scriptures are filled with people who's lives did not go the way they would have wanted. We, like they did, need to embrace our brokenness, embrace our lives - every chapter being written. It's as if God is saying, "It's okay... your story is not done yet, there are more chapters to come. Embrace them. And in the end... I'll re-tell the whole story and then you'll see it as I do."  The response time tonight was amazing! It was incredible to see students taking communion together - even serving one another communion. I saw two guys at the commuion station tonight, offering communion to one another, praying for each other, weeping and embracing their current chapter of their story of faith. To the left of the communion station was a painting canvas, where students were given red paint to express themselves. As I stood there watching the canvas fill with thoughts and prayers, one student wrote, "I give you my past." Another wrote "Freedom", placing a red hand print next to it.  I stepped forward, picking up the red paint. With my finger I wrote "I'm alive!"  I been sensing lately that God is inviting me to embrace the journey of what he is doing in my life. I sense that God is beginning to write a new chapter in my life. He is the master artist, taking my life's canvas and creating something good and beautiful and right. Something only he can make of my life as I choose to follow his way of living. I want my life in the here abnd now to matter. As the Jewish sages embraced, "The good deeds of our lives are the very seeds with which God plants the trees of heaven." May our lives be lived as a beautiful mosaic of kingdom life.

      I came across this quote from Abraham Joshua Heschel and have been thinking deeply about it lately. Heschel was perhaps the greatest Jewish thinker and theologian of our time, who carried with him a depth of intimacy with God that was truly profound. Enjoy.   "What is man? A being in trevail with God's dreams, with God's dream of a world redeemed, of reconciliation of heaven and earth. God's dream is not to be alone, to have mankind as a partner in the drama of continuous creation. By whatever we do... we either advance or obstruct the drama of redemption; we either reduce or enhance the power of evil."  [from   urlLink I Asked for Wonder: A Spiritual Anthology ]

      The following are three articles well worth your time investigating. The first is  urlLink an interview with Rob Bell  about teaching as a subversive artform. Rob is perhaps one of the most innovative communicators around and, as you'll see in the article, one of the most refreshing biblical thinkers. The second is  urlLink a new column by Brian McLaren  in Leadership Journal. As always, he is to the point and devastatingly accurate in his critique of current church culture. The last is  urlLink  an engaging article by David Bivin , which explores the first century context of a difficult teaching of Jesus. Ever wonder what Jesus meant when he said that he did not come to "destroy" the law, but to "fulfill" it? Check it out. You'll be blown away!

      The fourth was spent in grand style at the DeVries casa. Tonight, we ventured out for an evening of fireworks [along with just about every other living being in South Orange County] at Dana Point Harbor along with Rich and Johanna, a couple from our Community Group at SCU. We decided to perch ourselves at the top of the cliffs in the gazebo at the Blue Lantern Inn. From our bird's eye view, we looked down on the fireworks in the harbor AND got an incredible view of the fireworks in San Clemente. Two for the price of one! Great times. Great friends. That's what the fourth is all about! [As well as earlier in the day putting back a couple of dogs and a Corona while watching the baseball game - ahh, the joys of the fourth! You gotta love it!]

      It's been a couple of days since we got back, but our family spent the week up in the local mountains at Ponderosa Pines, where we were a part of their high school summer camp. I'm speaking three weeks for them, with this last week being week two of three.  It was an incredible week, capped off by getting to work again with my dog, Ashdown. Jasen and I connect deeply, and it seems that God is doing something in us together on this journey of life and spirituality.  It's really rare when you find someone whom you connect with so deeply that you sense that your life's journeys are somehow intertwined. That's the way it is with J and I. We've got a kindred mind, heart, and spirit. We see life and God the same.  The week's teaching explored the camp theme, "Captured" [a "Pirates of the Carribean" piratey sort of thing]. All week we challenged students to embrace life in Jesus, life the way we were created to live, rather than live the way we want to live. While we were there, late one night we got to talking in the Chalet. It seems so often that we tell people to embrace life in Jesus because life without him is somehow lacking. Although I think I understand that perspective, we seem to "sell" the kingdom from a negative, "the world is horrible, so give your life to Jesus now" perspective, rather than the way it seems Jesus spoke about the kingdom. Why is it that we seem to hold up Christianity as the last alternative of two mediocre at best options? Why don't we express being a follower of Jesus in the terms Jesus talked about - a way of living life that brings freedom and a profound sense of wholeness - the best way to live and the best option? We posed this question, "If there were no heaven and no hell, would following Jesus' teachings and life still be the best way to live in this world?"  Jesus offers life, real life - the way God intended us to live. As Eugene Peterson translates it in The Message, Jesus comes to offer "real and eternal life, more and better than they ever dreamed of." Rather than focusing on how bad the world is, Jesus says, "Hey, that life that you're living... Is it working for you? Does it really bring you life? Does to heal the broken places of your life?" To which he replies, "Try living this way. Try following my teachings and you'll find freedom and life. You'll be the person you were created to be... a person of love and compassion, of mercy and forgiveness, of wholeness."  Isn't that what we truly want? We want our lives to be lived the way we were created to live. Jesus stated it best when he said,  "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know [experience] the truth, and the truth will set you free."  [John 8.31-32]  I don't know about you, but I want to live free and whole. Doesn't everyone?

      Okay... it's official.  For those of you who have been praying for and encouraging our family - the decision is done. We are going back to Yorba Linda Friends Church! For those of you who have not been in the loop - here's the story.  Late last year, I was in a class in grad school with Matt Cork, the lead pastor of YLFC. He and I began a conversation about the emerging culture and the subsequent church culture change that is happening. I shared my vision for what we were doing at South County United and our heartbeat for engaging this culture spiritually aand redemptively. He asked me at that time if I'd be interested in coming back to YLFC. My reply, "Thanks, but no thanks." Matt continued after me. I decided that I would pray about it and see if God was in it. I met with the Team Leaders there at YLFC and shared my heart with them for a new expression of spirituality and church culture. I figured, what do I have to lose, huh! It went well. I met with the elders and decided that I would completely be myself, letting them know my thoughts on life, spirituality, God and church. There were a few wide eyes, but all in all they unanimously agreed to extend an offer to me to come back to YLFC. After a few weeks of agonizing and wondering about "going back". We felt that God was moving in a unique way. I spent 11 years of my life there and left - to find out what I believed and how I wanted to embrace God and life. The invitation to "go back" and help change the church culture there is an amazing opportunity. As Angie Horn-Andreu put it. "Anyone can go off and start their own thing, but how many people are invited to go back to change something that already is." Words of wisdom right there! [She also made the following comment, "Are they sure they know what they're getting themselves into? Do they really know you?" Hhhmmm.]  In short, I'm going back as the teaching pastor of The Journey, a new expression of Yorba Linda Friends Church. Our dream is to see a community of people embrace God and spirituality in a new way. It will not be just "a service" but an emerging community of followers celebrating and doing life together - embracing the journey of spirituality in today's culture. Our hope is to see a community of people experiencing a deep sense of love and transformation where they live - with those who follow Jesus and those who don't. The "goal" from the Yorba Linda side is to dive into this new mindset of how we connect with God, exploring it as the DNA of the Yorba Linda Friends Church of the future.  Lately, I've been awakening to the reality that it's not all about "opportunities" that come our way, but also about the people we get to travel the road with. What makes this jorney all the sweeter is that I get to travel it with a true "brother", Jasen Ashdown. Ash was our worship leader at the inception of South County United, and lived with us for about 6 months. During that time, God fused our hearts and souls together. When this YLFC thing was fermenting in us, I contacted Jasen about coming with us and being a part of the team for The Journey. I am so blessed to be in partnership again with such a great friend and amazing worship leader. The two of us working together is a dream come true. I'm so excited to see all that God does as we travel the road together. Stop by the blog frequently, as I will be using this canvas as a place to "think out loud" about the journey we are on and the conversations that help formulate our experience. My hope is to be honest about our church journey, as well as my own journey of awakening to God in this world.  So there ya have it! We're following and desperately wanting to be exactly where God wants us to be - wherever that may be. This is not how we would have written the story, but we have a profound sense that something is being born - in us and in the community of his followers. Our community of followers that gather together at South County United are excited as well. They are sending us out as "missionaries" of a new expression in this culture, and we sense their love and support. They are an amazing body with an amazing vision for God and our communities. I am deeply and spiritually changed by my time there.  And so the journey begins...

       As I've been reading Merton's thoughts on the nature of the Scriptures, I keep thinking about a quote I once heard. I have no idea where I heard it, but here goes...   There's a little bit of heresy in all theology.   [Mike's translation -  There's a little heresy in all of us!  We may think we know how God works, but as soon as we "systematize" God we somehow end up worshipping an idol, something less than the true and living God. The Scriptures are not something to master, but something to be mastered by. The text is not something to give us all the answers about life, but drive us to ask the ultimate questions of life and being. None of us have a corner on the market on truth.]
