      portugal deserved it. the drive. the hunger. i dare say eriksson blew it. insane. hargreaves for gerrard. get that david bleaghkham outta there. overrated fuckwit.   france? what can i say. they've burned out. kudos to greece. superb effort.   im rooting for le oranje. especially with robben doing so well. hope van der vaart gets a start.   it's all in the flair. in the hunger. in the drive.   vsair rocks. simply gave me the best years of my life. made a better person. infused me with the best values. gave me the best of friends. june camp was good. oh hell yeah it was good.   VS NCC(Air) 47th NCOs     two days to go. i am not prepared. all hail the failure.

      i feel revived. relieved. i believe i have changed from the me of old. i think i'm rather cheerful now. more serious of the important things in life. more appreciative of those around me. more relaxed.   bang. irony. so relaxed im not prepared for the mid years. damn.    but yeah i guess im not as morbid as before. good for me. but still feel alone though. not as in im yearning for someone. like im living in my own world. crazy stuff.    its all in the flair. the samba boys of europe had all the flair. go home and cry english. oh alright i'm biased. you have to admire a side with deco and cris ronaldo in it. too bad figo's just a shadow of the greatness he was.      au revoir~

      financial trouble. my sis down in perth is spending money like a damn lazyfuck on dole. and here in sg we're suffering to pay her tuition fees. damn insensitive asshole.   think about it. all the cash's been used up to put tht fuckwit into curtin uni. how am i supposed to go overseas. oh yeah. top-notch scholarships. but a top-notch student i am not. and seriously speaking with all the fuck thats happening in the world today would the army give a scholarship to a damn brown-skinned muslim. doesnt matter how much i believe in defending this ingrate of a country though.   thats the end of the good life i guess. and the problems keep piling like dead souls.

      the emptiness still lives inside.   just a few interesting insights i guess. chia keat's a lot like me in many ways. from ncc, spends a lot more time with secondary school friends, drummer, likes punk. too bad im not his height. i wish. heh.  rashimah's real nice. though its quite sad she doesnt really know who am i. quite surprised a tkg girl would go to njc. and quite sad she's year two. ok stop giving me those stares.    its still a long way to the end. dont slip and fall.

      happiness is dead.   cant stop missing the seminar. life was good. people were good. talking to eleana was good.  sigh.   whats the point of leaving. coming home to bitch of a mom. having to mug.  im not happy. duh.    why do i always feel so empty. is this desire for someone special even necessary. fuckwit.   and its always the same old game im playing. and its always the same old devil laughing at me. down on the floor. i lost again. winning doesnt exist.

      sometimes i look back at what ive done in my life and the answer is nothing. then i try to find an answer for why im so dark inside and the answer is everything. i know that most of the time i dont get what im trying to say, what im trying to spit out. but it feels better shouting anyway.    dont tell me what to fucking do. i do what i damn well want. you dont leave me alone out in the cold for all my life and now when you finally realise your mistakes you want to take control again. its too late. its over. ive lived my life on my own. this shell, this living space is just a hostel. home is fantasy. home has always been my own soul where i found solace in myself and the beautiful things in life around me. you dont and wont ever tell me what to do. cos when i was helpless and needed you most you were never there.     alone in a crowd. i wish i wasnt a shadow. dont walk right through me.

      you think you know me. you'd be surprised.  facades run wild. you'd better fear who i am inside.   i never show my true self though. so i guess its alright.   but never forget. im a very.   very.   dark person inside.         and if i show my true self. thats when i draw first blood.           so it begins.

       I wish it didn't hurt,    hurt like this   To say these things to you.   I'll sacrifice   one moment    for one truth.   If we get through    tomorrow    then we'll be fine.   We'll wait for    forever    and see how close we get.   It's just another day,   &nbsp;one more chance   to get this right.   I'll sacrifice    forever    please just for tonight.   If we get through    tomorrow    then we'll be fine.   We'll wait for   &nbsp;forever    and see how close we get.   The worst is over for now.   Take a breath    now let it out.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  stupid. is me.   75 days.

      distractions distractions. love is a stupid mechanism meant to give humans a sense of happiness and fabricate dreams out of meaningless happenings in reality. tsk tsk. cynical me. aint my fault. typical.   so i screwed my mid years. and i'm a fuckin 7 pointer. so what's new. failure after failure...that's just me. i'll bounce back of course...but once you're in too deep how far can you actually rise up to the occasion again? it's that sickening feeling of having to look back on how much has come and gone and you're failing everything you live for. especially since its me. the one. i live for myself. this residence is a hostel. this people who brought me up dont look like parents in my eyes. this life i have is mine to make or break it.   better stuff. nyjc gig rocked. frenetic. simply frenetic energy everytime i pick up those sticks and let loose on the drums. i think we did great even though we got screwed due to audio technicalities...screw the juxtaposition of 'advancements' and 'technology'. im gonna make it big somehow. someday.      ripoff. live the dream.

      everything that has happened recently has been utterly confusing.   can't say that i've strayed from the norm. nope, nothing interesting happening here.    so why am i posting? cos i can. and that's a powerful realisation. yeah like whatever. sounds stupid. but.    [dead poetic]
