       School was  good  today. I was able to concentrate, I was in a good mood, and we finished the class a half an hour  earlier ! Usually we finish a couple minute past 12. But I had to do some extra stuff just so we could finish the class for the full amount of 3 hours and a half.   Math was quick and easy. Grammar was actually  fun  this time, even though they gave me 30 problems. And Science was only 2 pages. But I had to do some extra poetry to finish the class. It was fun, anyway.  Remember when I was typing hysterically yesterday about the Mall incident? Well, I admit... I was being a bit hysterical. Everything seems to be O.K. right now. No nasty vibes as of yet, hehe.  My teacher is going to have a little time off on Thursday and Friday to go to this one popular beach with her friends, because she said that this will be the last moment of vacation till August. That's when she goes back to University. But I don't mind! (I didn't say that to her.) That means I probably won't have school on those days.  The packers will be here on Monday. But my mom said that I can pack when ever I want until Monday. "You should pack anything that you don't want them to pack," is what my mom told me. I probably will do that later, though.   I have been doing some research about dragons. (But I have only found one website which I have really looked through thoroughly. Which you can find here: http://www.draconian.com/home/frameset.htm) For dragons will be a important part of my story. I don't know for what, as of now. But I'll get an idea soon. Hopefully inspiration will take hold of me.  I just finished playing Harvest Moon AWL. I love that game! It can be so much fun. It's a farming game, for people who don't know. I'm on Chapter 2, in the second year. I got a wife and little kid. He's only 3 years old or something, so I get to carry him and snuggle him. And I can do so many other things with him.  It's so cute! I can buy little toys for him too. And sometimes you can find him playing with them. My cow finally gave birth to a calf, and he's so adorable! I named him Jesse. Funny, it was the first name I thought of when those little guys said to give him a cool name because he was a boy. I thought of Jesse McCartney. So I picked Jesse, lol. Anyway, if anybody wants to know more about the game, go to this great website: http://hmotaku.net. Click on "Games" in the navigation and then click on "AWL". That's the game you want to learn about.  I'm listening to that song again... the one called "The Second Star to the Right". I still love that song. I love the rhythm, and the lyrics are nice. I'll type some for you guys... just for your amusement. Or boredom, in my case.     Ready. The Second Star... Here we go.  Dream your way to the stars in the sky. You and me, me and you on the way to the top. Spread your wings. We can fly to the stars in the sky. In the sky to the left, to the moon, there's a star on the right. And I can meet you. I can meet you. I can meet you.   The Second Star to the right, shines in the night for you. To tell you that the dreams you plan really can come true. ( Come true. ) The second star to the right shines with a light that's red. And if it's Never Land you need, it's light will lead you there.  Twinkle, twinkle, little star. ( Little star. ) So I'll know ( I will know )  where you are. ( Where you are.  )  Gleaming in the skies above. (Ooh.) Lead me to the land I dreamed of. And when are journey is through. Each time we say good night, (Say good night) we'll thank the little star that shines, the second from the right. (Second from the right. )   The Second Star... (Yeah... ooh.) The Second Star... (Yeah... waooh.)

       It's almost 9:00 o'clock and I should be getting ready for bed. But I'm not going to just yet. I don't have much to say... Just like I haven't had much to say about the other times I contemplated to post. I haven't been here in a while, huh? Well, I guess I just never had the time to gather anything together to talk about, or I just felt plain lazy. Whatever...  I'm moving in exactly a week. Can you believe it? Because I sure am having a hard time to. The idea has crossed my mind a couple times, but I didn't think it would be happening so soon! But it's actually pretty exciting. New room, new ideas, new place. Lot's of "new". Well, actually I am just moving to a new house out of the city, so it doesn't make that much of a change. But it's out of the city, and things are different there... so it does make a change for me. An interesting change... I am just rambling here.  Jesse McCarteny. I love his voice... I keep on listening to the song he sang that's called : "The Second Star to the Right", which supposedly comes from Peter Pan. Though it makes sense. The lyrics match... it's just that I don't remember hearing it in the movie before. (I think it's from the movie...) Anyway, the lyrics are really easy to sing a long to, and I just love it. I know, that sounds so pointless, but it is. I'm just rambling here... because I'm bored. Smart people out there, ignore this post for I will hopefully have a better one to type later!

       Oh my gosh, David Lanz has such beautiful music! He writes New Age music. But he writes it so beautifully. And almost all his music he writes seem to have this middle age or fantasy touch to it. I love it!  My favorites right now are:  • "The Dragon's Daughter"  - Definitely one of my top favorites! Very fantasy-like.  • "Oaks"  - Takes you right into the middle ages.  • "Cello's Song"  - It's a little sad but happy at the same time. It's very pretty. It reminds me of LoZ: The Wind Waker game!  • "Madre de la Tierra"  - So sweet! I love it. I think this one is one of my top favorites, too.   • "Long Way from Home"  - It definitely shows you the feeling of wanting to go home. It sort of expresses the happy memories of home. It's sad, yet happy. Beautiful, I love how he uses the violin and piano in this one.  • "Madrona"  - Another sweet one. I love the piano. I want to learn now... maybe. It has a very calm/romantic feeling to it. The guitar is mixed nicely.  All those songs above come from his album called "Convergence".  Ok, now I want to talk about the "Pirates of the Caribbean". I really loved that movie, it has to be my favorite movie right now. And even if there was some little spooky parts, they made it really funny, so you could actually laugh at some of them. Like when the pirate that had the glass eye, it came out by accident and then he started crawling on the floor to look for it! He was in his skeleton form, because that was in the part of the movie when they were fighting on the ship at night. That was a very funny part.  I also loved the actors Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp. I really liked how Johnny Depp played the part of Captain Jack Sparrow. He was a real smooth talker, and I liked that! It made me giggle at everything he said. He was really funny. All the other actors like Orlando Bloom and the actor who played Elizabeth Swan, they both played really well. And all the other actors, too. I liked them all! Anyway, I loved that movie.  Hmm... I went swimming today, and even though the Sun was out, the water was pretty cold. But it was refreshing and I had fun.  School was so annoying today. It was still review, but just Math. And I hate Math. It's my least favorite subject and my worst. And it's the most annoying. But in the end it was worth going through the frustrating struggle because I finished review. The only bad thing about that is it means the test will start tomorrow! Anyway, what made school the most annoying was because I was late. Now, that may be weird because I am home-schooled. So my teacher/tutor comes here to do school, I don't have to go anywhere. I woke up around 7:00 o'clock in the morning... nothing really unusual. And so I decided to sneak to my computer to check my email and stuff before I would have to get ready. I was lazy and I basically waited till the last minute to get ready, which was like 15 minute before 8:30! (That's when school starts...) So I was in a real rush to get ready. And when I got out of the shower and got dressed, I went to the through the door that's in the hallway, which leads to the temple room and kitchen. I was going there to wake up the Deities and do my mantra, but just out of the kitchen I hear my teacher talking! For whatever reason I didn't want her to see me yet so I ran to the little office that's around the temple room to hide. Then a couple seconds after that I did my mantra and the things I had to do. But... I forget why I brought up this topic. What was the point again? I can't remember! Well anyway, I was really late and that was annoying. I guess that was the point I wanted to make. I'm not really sure, though. Oh well! It was fun rambling about it.

       I decided to check this place after all. At first I thought I would JUST join so I could comment on Chai's blog. Eh...I know, weird. But then they were showing me all these nice things you could choose for your blog. So maybe I'll just move my fort here. ;P

       School was good today, and everything went smoothly. The only thing that really annoyed me was when we did Science. I am not a big fan of Science, and making a chart of the planets and the information about them is not my good point. It seemed like it took forever...  I actually made my own homework today. Meaning I insisted that I get homework. That's because I was supposed to finish writing the book review of Anne of Green Gables, but even though it was still early, I thought it would be too much pressure to finish it in school with my teacher waiting on my every move. So I assigned it as homework myself, so I can now do it on the weekend. Oh, joy.  Did you know? It's Friday the 13th! My teacher reminded me of that this morning. I wonder... nothing unlucky has happened today so far. Not that I believe in such superstitions, but it's fun to think it's something of a holiday or an unusual, different day.  I'm downloading episode 147 and 148 of Inuyasha. I haven't watched Inuyasha in such a long time! So I am determined to get back on track with the episodes again. It will probably another day until it's finished downloading.  As usual, after sometime on the computer, I played some video games. For a change, I played a little bit of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. I like listening to the opening song when you start the game, it's very pretty. But it can get annoying after listening to it more then twice. The graphics are very good, and I like the game a lot in general, it's just very hard. And me and my dad are stuck on this one boss in the Mushroom Forest.  After FF: CC, I played Harvest Moon AWL. Yes it's true, you can't take me away from my farm for very long. I'm in Chapter 3 now, and my son has grown. And he even has his own room now. Recently he has been asking me questions about how farming is. Like: "Dad, is farming fun?" and then you have 3 options. The 1st one is "Not at all", the second one is "It's fun" and the third is "Why ask?". I pick option #2, because it is fun! And then he gets all happy, saying he knew it was true and that he wants to be a farmer when he grows up. He also has increased his liking of animals. He thinks they're really cute. I'm glad he think so, because I want him to become a farmer.  Later my dad called me down stairs. We got a pool table today! First my mom and  dad played together. My mom lost. Then my dad told me how to play. Then my dad and me played against each other. It's not that bad of a game, actually. But it's not easy and it's not that exciting either. I didn't get any balls in, even though I might have gotten a close shot. So, as you might have guessed, my dad won.  This morning I read the part one of the 1st chapter of Chai's story. I loved it, I really did. It was interesting and had lots of suspense. You gotta love suspense! I really wanna know what will happen next! Hope you're writing is doing good, Chai!  ... I think that is all. Hmm, pretty normal day. Um, bye-bye journal/diary!
