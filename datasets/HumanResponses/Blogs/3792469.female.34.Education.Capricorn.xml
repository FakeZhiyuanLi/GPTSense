       our national soccer team lost the semi finals in the european championship. although this has nothing to do with my study. this is some crazy thing with the country i live in. nobody believed they could get this far. because this wasn't the best team we ever had and the practice games really went very bad and the captain, well the captain...  and the fact is when a national team has lost 'they lost'. should they have won 'we won'.

       ..although it feels like i'm the only one enjoying..  this will be the place where i can let the world know how i'm doing with my new and refound love. see.. i've taken up the study i wanted to do since i was fifteen. but somewhere my life took a different turn.  it feels like i'm getting a second chance and i'm only nineteen years older.  someday i will be an architect!

       this friday i saw the thermals in tivoli. they gave a great performance, although the public was a bit shy (in dutch i would say 'lauw'). they hardly&nbsp;applauded and almost didn't move. well, nowadays i'm not a dancer at concerts myself, i show my enthusiasm by clapping and whistling. but&nbsp;if i were&nbsp;younger i would pogo at this concert.     &nbsp;   saturday our parents had their 35th wedding anniversary. my sister thought it would be nice to surprise them with the&nbsp;play 'caesar and cleopatra' in the 'amsterdamse bos'. she lured them to her house and at the end of the afternoon my friend and i came in -&nbsp;which was already a surprise - and then we went to the open air theatre, had a picnic&nbsp;till the play began at 21.30.    it was a good and entertaining play, the weather was nice, but the mosquito's were a pain! i have 4 itchy bumps now.     sunday a friend of mine came over and we went to see the Dom. the cathedral exists 750 years, but in 1674 the mid ship was blown away by a great storm. they never rebuilt it because of shortage of money. this year they&nbsp;construed it with 'steigerpijpen'. (it's the construction pipes used when&nbsp;constructing or renovating buildings)    standing next to it you could imagine what huge this cathedral would have been. but probably seeing it from a distance&nbsp;and from above&nbsp;would give yet a better idea. unfortunately that is not easy in a city like utrecht.    we stayed in a spiritual mood and visited the catharijne convent - a museum in a&nbsp;medieval monastery and about religion. there we saw some nice icons from russia.     &nbsp;   in the evening we saw fahrenheit 9/11 in the new cultural centre 'louis hartlooper complex'.    the building (1928)&nbsp;is an example of the amsterdamse school and is designed by J.I. Planjer. it was originally used as a police office, but in 1987 the police thought it&nbsp;did no longer fit, it was too small. several ideas for future use followed and it took till&nbsp;2004 to become a cultural centre for film, arts and debate. the official opening will be this fall.     &nbsp;   and the documentary... well&nbsp;it was a nice and clever&nbsp;work of cutting and pasting. it&nbsp;makes you think about it&nbsp;nonetheless. but doesn't the&nbsp;other&nbsp;point of view&nbsp;does that also? by showing only&nbsp;fragments you get curious, whether they support bush's point of view of moore's. you just want to find out what's the whole story. and the harder you seek the more questions you come up with. isn't there an american saying?   the plain and simple truth is neither plain nor simple .

       urlLink      detail_houtverbinding&nbsp;  urlLink   &nbsp;    the first thing we did for our study architecture was&nbsp;paying a visit to the 'openluchtmuseum' in arnhem. it's a nice place where they have gathered some architectural highlights from the netherlands. there are&nbsp;farms, all kind of&nbsp;mills, a&nbsp;complete north holland town&nbsp;and much more. this is an construction which they often used for farms, so you could take it apart&nbsp;and put it together again easy. i like its simplicity.

       yesterday i met my old roommates. we lived together in a student home for a couple of years. it was a cozy place. there were no secrets, you had to get along very well. luckily we did. except for one person and sure we didn't miss her this evening.  so we saw each other again. margot after 5 years, eileen after a year or 3 and helen & giulietta i still meet twice or thrice a year.  Nobody really changed, nor in looks nor in behavior. we ate at a dinner cafe and we had a lot to talk about. eileen and margot turned out to be mothers. ( some things you really don't want to hear when you're not a mother yourself though... )  we had a great time. we'll meet again.
