      I can't help but thinking...China is growing so quickly.  We are outsourcing to them because they will do things so cheaply.  Did you know that China is going to be exceeding the coal requirements of the US sooner, rather than later?  The entire worldwide economic boom is benefiting China.  It makes sense...they have a fifth of the population.  I am not an ecnomist by any stretch of the imagination.  I cannot even manage to balance my own checkbook (that's what online banking is for, right?).  One day, will there be a Kathy Lee Hin?  And a Regis Hung?  Will there be a big controversy in China about "children working in American sweatshops?"  If we are sending all of our money (granted, they produce more, for less) won't they eventually have all of the money?  When they have all of the money, won't our people be willing to work for pennies an hour just to feed their family?  All of the sparked in my head when I was told to save 10% of my gross income for retirement.  Even though I'll retire with a few million dollars (based on the 10% figure) won't it be the same as $100 today?  I know, I know...compound interest, inflation, etc. etc.  But look what a few million got your forty years ago vs. today.  And look how much faster the economy is growing (I think?).  What about the terrorists.  If they ruin my country or take my life before retirement, that is 10% more I could have enjoyed throughout life.  I don't know...I am going to save, because I like to think I am optimistic (hard to believe by my blog, eh?)...and I will be around the enjoy the fruit of my labor.  But, still...what if I'm not.  It's going to be hard to set aside 10% every week.

       urlLink    I've been in touch with the producer of an upcoming movie about meth abuse.  One scary thing I found on methfilm.com is:  "According to the CDC, rates of new HIV infections among gay men have risen 17 percent between 1999 and 2002."  Extremely scary -- yet completely believable.  I cannot preach the importance of safe sex enough.  This is just proof that my driving the point home to anybody that will listen is 100% worthwhile.

       urlLink George Bush Jr. Resume   This is the resume of our president, George W. Bush Jr.  I wish I could state the source as TheOnion.com, but it's all real.  Read it...and think about it on election day.  About election day.  He will win re-election.  Why do you think they are pushing for electronic voting booths?  They are so easy to rig.  Why do you think they are defending not having a paper audit trail?  So that they are easy to rig.  The CEO of Diebold, the largest manufacturer of electronic voting machines is a staunch republican.  He has said on the record that he will help the republicans win the election.  What exactly does that mean?  In an earlier Georgia election, electronic voting machines were used for the first time.  The results?  The complete opposite of the primaries.  There was/is absolutely no explanation as to why.  There are a lot more details about it that would raise your red flag ... read it in an issue of GQ a few months back.

       Last night I was told that I am too energetic!   Moi?  Ironically, I am on percocet.  How can someone taking percocet be too energetic?  What am I like when I am not on them?  Speaking of...I have been so incredibly focused lately.  While most people get loopy and delerious, I get a lot done.  Thinking back, I was hooked on them for quite some time three years ago.  I've been hooked on a lot of things.  But, I seem to give each thing up (except smoking) as easily as I pick it up.  I have an appointment with the psychiatrist on the 25th.  I've stopped taking my med for ADD and I am beginning to see the positive influence it had on my life.  When medicated, I was organized and focused.  I have lost any sort of organization I used to posess and the ability to focus is beginning to follow.  What I didn't like about the dextroamphetamine was that I had problems falling asleep at night.  Once I was asleep, everything was fine -- getting there was always difficult.  I need to find a balance.  Perhaps 40MG was too much and I need something like 20?  I keep trying to remember to take a small dose of the ones I have leftover to see if I am more focused...but typical of ADD, I forget the dose.  One thing that worries me about going back on the meds is that I became extremely reclusive.  I was happy, but I didn't venture outside of the house much.  I always viewed it as being content...I was always misreable when I was running around, as I couldn't standing being alone.  I viewed being reclusive as finally being at peace with myself.  So, I don't know what to do.  I cannot determine if the positives outweight the negatives.  I wish I had the answer!

      This afternoon somebody opened up to me and told me what they've been thinking and feeling for a long time.  Somebody I thought was growing further away from me, actually desired to grow closer.  Through all of the ups and downs and curveballs that life throws at us, I never lost a shred of respect for this person.  Others would likely view their actions as self-destructive, but I always saw the pained, loving man that wanted one thing...to be loved back.  I watched go through countless relationships seeking the thing he experienced but a few times in his life: unconditional love.  I thought he found it...once again...but one of those curveballs came.  The love required too much work and it wasn't fair for either of them to have to try so hard, seeking the one thing they desired and wanted to express to one another.  Although they felt all of the magic, there were too many circumstances and outside pressures to let it evolve into something everlasting.  I've listened to him one week say that all he wanted was what he had with his wife.  I've heard him say another week that the people he chose to enter his life were to live up to his expectations or see their way to the door.  This is what I like to call confliction.  I get it all of the time.  I think one thing, but feel the total opposite.  While I normally bottle my feelings, I always wore them on my sleeve for him.  I became extremely jealous when he would make comments about Joey, his longtime love interest.  Depending on his mood, he'd talk about how wonderful his life would be with Joey, and I would think to myself "why is he dreaming of how awesome life *can* be when he can live that dream with me?"  "I love you's" have always been exchanged in every conversations.  Virtual kisses (MWAH!) are also exchanged.  Other than that, he would bottle whatever he was feeling, and oftentimes, I would bottle what I was feeling.  He never outright rejected me, but he did sit on the see-saw about how he envisioned our future.  One time, I'd be a great friend forever, another time we'd live in the woods on the Potomac River or Chesapeake Bay in a little 2 bedroom bungalow.  We were going to move to London.  We were going to rid ourselves of all worldly possessions and backpack the pacific coast.  We were going to go snorkeling.  We were going to do everything together...but then we'd be friends again.  In all honesty, I had given up.  For a year, my feelings were intense.  The second year, they started becoming a memory.  Many miles and tons of traffic seperated us and neither of us are motivated to drive the distance.  Boy 1 became Boy 2 who became Boy 3.  I thought he had made a decision to be self-sufficient in the love department and seek sexual gratification through anonymous sex.  You can't change somebody, and you can't make them feel the way you do, so I just gave up.  Two days ago, I got a long stream of text messages on my cell phone.  They said exactly what I had been hoping to hear.  This time they seemed more real.  Maybe it's because I know in the past two years, he's had a chance to see what's out there -- and it's not pretty (at least on the inside).  For whatever reason, I really believed it.  The text messages included a call to action...a phone call that evening.  Of course, that never happened, because life (as always) got in the way.  The call happened this evening.  And the voice on the other end of the phone sounded defeated.  Defeated in a good way.  Almost surrender.  He finally told me he felt the same way he did.  And then he talked about the ups and downs he will have.  Then I reminded him that I am a Gemini (as he is, too) and that I promise to have just as many.  So now we're going to see where it goes (again).  This time, I've gotten the reassurance that it's not talk, but truly felt emotions.  Only time will tell...

      After a meeting today, my Webmaster said to me "we have to get those monkeys off our back.  They aren't just monkeys, but retarded monkeys.  Somebody needs to give them a banana.  It's like one of the monkeys is on your back and screwing you in the ear at the same time.  Then his buddy comes up and he wants to stick it in, too."  Now, all I can picture is two "Mini-me" type characters dressed as the friends clown humping my Webmasters head.  Eh, this may be one of those "you had to have been there" stories.  Oh well.

       urlLink Life at TJ's Place :   "This afternoon, Walt, our bouncer, found a leather pouch of some sort that had been run-over in the parking lot. He picked it up and looked at it. I think he thought it was drug paraphernalia, because he sniffed it, then sniffed his fingers.  I found Walt in the bathroom a few minutes later with his head in the sink, running cold water over his eyes. The leather pouch he touched and sniffed was a pepper-spray canister holder, with the little canister still in it. It had been crushed by the tires of a car. When Walt picked it up, he smelled it, which irritated his eyes, then he rubbed his eyes with his hands that had the chemical all over it. Walt is the toughest person I have ever met. He was a mess. It makes me wonder how those assholes on the cop shows can get sprayed with enough Mace to kill a buffalo and still keep coming after the cops. "  That is just too funny... Jesse

       urlLink Yahoo! Photos - 5/24/04   As you can see in the link ... I went to Baltimore again ... and Amy and I ran around the neighborhood taking pictures of ourselves.  Then I had some fun in Photoshop and made her look like an elf ... but I am not allowed to post those photos ... only the ones of myself.

       urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Huge Meth Lab Found in Middle of Pacific : "Police raided a huge methamphetamine factory in Fiji's capital, arresting seven people and seizing enough chemicals to make $540 million worth of the drug."  All I can say is that I am glad they discovered this!  Maybe...just maybe (although highly unlikely) it will make some people's lives a little more inconvenient!

      One of the best books out there is called "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy."  It's written by the Michael Moore of Great Brittan and includes claims such as what was published in the Washington Post today.  It turns out that Enron was behind the California power crisis, costing Californians billions of dollars...  Full article below.   Why isn't Ken Lay in federal prison?    urlLink Records Show Enron Manipulation, Washington State Utility Says (washingtonpost.com) : "Confidential Enron Corp. accounting records show that its traders were manipulating electricity prices on nearly every day of the year-long West Coast electricity crisis in 2000-2001, Washington state utility officials said yesterday.

       urlLink JohnKerryIsADoucheBagButImVotingForHimAnyway.com : "John Kerry is a douchebag, but I'm voting for him anyway. Well, not really. That is to say, he's not actually a douchebag, or not nearly as much of one as what the media, George W., and even perhaps John Kerry himself have made him out to be. It seemed that every time I saw, heard, or read something about Kerry, his doucheness factor increased. It wasn't until I did just a little research on my own that it became clear that most of these occurrences could be explained as lies, deception, media excess, or simply poor campaigning strategy. It is beyond vital that we all overlook these minor blemishes and unpleasantries, and unite in electing John Kerry to be the next president of the United States of America."
