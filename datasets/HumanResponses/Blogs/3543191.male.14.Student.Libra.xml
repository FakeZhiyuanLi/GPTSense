       Ouch! Had 3 accidents recently. First one was during PE lesson. When we were runnin, a friend unintentionally kicked my foot from behind, causing me to trip over another friend's foot and fall on my  left  side.Had a few scratches on the area just  left  of my knee. other than that i was alright and carried on running. Second one was when we were in the IT Room having CD. Me and two of mah peeps couldn't find anymore chairs, so we decided to use broken ones instead. The only problem about these chairs was that their back cushion could not stand up. I stupidly tried to fix it and ended getting my  left  thumb scratched by some metal part below the chair. Man, it was a quite a bad cut. Skin peeled off and a few minor scratches surrounded the more serious ones. Lost quite some blood too. Washed the wound before going down to the genral office to get it bandaged. Accompanying was Weiliang or Mr. Welfare. He helped the office staff in applying anticeptic and the bandaging process. Very thankful of him for that. The last injury happened just today. We were in the hall preparing for the Racial Harmony skit. Me and some others were kicking a soccer ball all over the house when i accidentally slided on the ball (opps!) and fell on my  left  side! My  left  arm was knocked real hard and the pain lingered long after the impact. It was so painful that i thought i broke my arm. The real point is that what's with my left side???? Why are all the injuries on the left??? What's next? My left side of my hair getting shaved off?? this is so lame....and painful...

       Today was fun....not becoz of the national day event but cos of SOCCER. Man i haven't touched soccer for a long long time and today we played it fer hours!I'll jus cut the long story short...bascially right after sch we made for the street soccer court and kicked a few goals and after that we went to Golden Village to have lunch...people that came were Leroy, Cheepong, Thomas, Isaac, Yanming, Aloysius, Guangwei, Zhaoyi, I and another guy who i don't know his name...while everyone was eating Burger King, Leroy and I patronised Old Chang Kee (or Old Chunky)...after eating, we went to neighbourhood 700+ to play soccer again....we started by passing the ball to each other...occasionally the ball will roll down to the road...luckily it didn't get squashed...furthermore it is a new ball...after abit of passing we had an unexpected challenge from Ahmad Ibrahim Sec Sch....I didn't play so i spectated and joked around with those not playing also...unfortunately guangwei got injured...sigh....later we went to the void deck and chatted for a few hours...only Leroy, Cheepong, Isaac, Thomas and I were there..we also played soccer there...I managed to learn a few tricks also...we talked about lots of stuff and I learnt alot about my frens and people i know...finally...it was a long day...I only reached home at about 7pm
