      Last night I went to Lids house at 8:30 pm and we watched Tom Sawyer and Fiddler on the Roof! It was soo cute.. lids was so adorable in fiddler!! haha.. neways.. then we had ice cream and ended both the movies at like 11:30 pm. then we were on the computer until 1am talking to ppl who have no lives cuz their on msn so damb late.. lol.. funi.. then me and lids went on www.bored.com.. that was funny! Then a like 1:30am we went into bed and talked until like 3:30 am then we feel asleep!!   Then we woke up at like 11am and we had breakfast!! Then we went down to the lake and it was soo hot that we were so tired to walk back so Lids mom picked us up. Then when we got home we were hungry so we had coke and CORN FLAKES BLOBS!! hahaha.. see. how it started was that we wanted to eat marshmellows so at first we toasted them on the oven. Then we decided to make rice krispy squares. We didnt have rice krispies so we used corn flakes. We melted the marshmellows in the oven and then mashed the corn flakes with them. I think it was a VERY bad idea to put the marshmellows in the own because the marshmellows were sooooo sticky that we had a very, very, very hard time mixing it!! IT was soo funi... It was soo nasty that we stuck the spoon into the CORN FLAKE BLOB which was in the bowl and we turned the bowl upside down balancing it on the spoon.. haha. it was soooo funi!!!.. Then we went upstairs and got ready to go. Then Mrs.Di Santo drove me home!! So sad the day was over!! :(.. i had a BLAST!! MUAZ LIDS!!  Now I am going to talk to you about what Lids said to me about acting and things;  I asked her about her perspective on acting since she is such a great actress and then she said to me that its not about the character you play but its about making the character its own unique character. For example.. since i was the sheriff i could have put on an accent and stuff and made the sheriff a very cool unique person. Then she was talking about how 3 years ago when they did Grease at Charactors, in Danielle Miller's show she was John in Grease and in aliey's show she was John in Grease. ( the same character) . And she told me that at one point that charcter sings a song to the audience. Lids compared the 2 shows for me and told me that in Ailey's show it was just like she was singing the song.. and thats all.. and she complained about her small role all year. However, Danielle being the greatest actress that she is, she did'nt care about her small role, she just tried to make it AS BIG AS POSSIBLE! Which is what YOU ARE SUPPOST TO DO!! So Danielle made a funky dance to the songstill staying in her character!! Lids said it was the funniest thing she ever saw!! NOTE: TO TAKE ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT SHE GAVE ME AND USE IT!!!!!!    Now moving on, this morning at like 11:30am my mom had to go to the hospital for Andrew because he was at a skateboarding park and he feel on a cement corner and he cut open his who knee just missing his vains.. IT WAS 2 CENTIMETERZ DEEP!! OUCH!!... he had to get 11 stiches AND ride in an ambulance!! LUCKY BUG!!! And when I was 8 i got stiches too.. but the DID'NT NUMB It!!! and th3 did for andy.. i wish i got attention like that!!! BUGGER!!! o welllllll.. im home now and everyone is ok..   O yeaaahh.. TODAY i read Lids journal.. ( she showed it to me im not that nosy)... and she was writing about how she thinks shes fat and everything and how she thinks she is ugly and untalented. She is exactly like me but I am fat. lol... maybe i wont admit to ugly but.. lol.. jokes. But honestly.. she is the tinyest thing ever!!! errr.. then she was writing about.. o god i hope this is a teenager thing.. im like... oh god lids this definatly is a teenager thing!!! i do it all the time!!! She was tellling me that sometimes she thinks she has everything but sometimes she jus feels like she does'nt. Sometimes I get jealous of Lids because she is so beautiful and she has a great body and she is AN AMAZING ACTOR!!!!!! I love her!!! She is so kind and perfect and sometimes I feel jealous and sometimes I don't. I don't even know why I would'nt ever be jealous of her.. shes perfect. I guess I would have to be in her shoes to understand  everything about her life. She is an only child and I wonder if that adds to it.!? O well, I jus hafta remember that no matter how jealous I get of her.. that is not going to make me a better person. I just need to learn how to accept myself for who I am.. yes I wanna be a beautiful actress with a perfect body and perfect smile.. yes I want to lose more weight.. yes I want to be rich and famous.. and YES MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!.. I want to be known.. i want people to care about me.. sometimes because this is the way I am this is how my personality forms. I wish I had a great personality so that I could help people to learn how not to judge a book by its cover. Most of those things were just HardCore dreams!! I know that most of them may not come true... but u can never tell until u try your hardest to make it happen.. the goal is to try so hard to try and prove yourself that you can do it!!!  Here is a quote that is in LIds Profile.. (sorry i stole it lids.. i jus (L) it )  I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night, "There must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I'm not going to worry about them. I'm dreaming the hardest. - Marilyn Manroe   Gotta love it!! Anyways, I g2g for now! (K)  xo caroline xo

      I know I already wrote something in here today, but I and bored and I want to write something else in here;  blahhh. What a hot nasty day, I watched how to become a superstar on MTV today and they said that u hafta look great on film.. im kinda depressed today cuz I know I don't look great, or as great as I would like to look, but in all of the success stories.. They said, make sure you always stick to the following: - never give up - trust yourself - trust your instincts - keep dreaming and your dreams will come true  Now, to look at all that and start to do it is hard. I hafta be my own unique person to do this. Have something that noone else has. This weekend my goal is to think of how I am unique and learn to stick to what a believe and to what I believe only. And when people put you down to understand that you need to let that by or you will never be successful.. outz  xocarolxo

      Today is Canada Day.. Happy Birthday!! Proud to be Canadian!!!  Neways today I woke up at 9 cuz last night we watched My Cousin Vinny. OMG best movie ever. Note: Get it on script with directors footnotes.  Anywho, I am reading Pygmalion now.. It rocks.. It was a play used in The COnfessions OF the TeeNage DraMa QUEEn!  Today Jon, Andy, Ian and Dad went golfing. Actually.. They just left. My mom is at Ruth Anne's house helping her paint and I am home babysitting Mikey and Vanessa. How fun!  I just realized that I and doing a musical and a play this summer. Then next year Sweet Charity , Honk at the City Playhouse ( if get in) and then the school production which lasts for like a week . Im booked wit plays.. neva done so many like this before. Never at the same time. Besides working with the murder mystery but then it sucked that I had to quit because of Tom Sawyer! O well, hopefully Sweet Charity won't be double casted next year. OOOO and this summer I'm going to Stratford with CharActors and were goin to c "Anything Goes"... I can't wait..I think in every blog I am going to talk about how excited I am and you will hear about my anticipation to get out there and act!! YESSHH!!  My mom is also trying to get me into this business in making powerpoints and stuff.. She thinks its going to be my future. I want to be an actress.. But not as bad as wanting to be a director... sooo many things I could do with being a director!! I like that Idea.. But as you know or maybe as u don't.. ( you'll find out in a sec.), every person going into the performing arts business in anyway SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP PLAN. I have a back up plan, TO BE A WEDDING CONSULTANT. I will never forget the day when my Grade 7 art teacher (asshole) laughed at me when we had to make an art picture of what we wanted to be when we grow up, and that I wanted to become an actor. I hated him so much. So I then thought of what else I should be, not that my dreams about being an actor were crushed or anything, but I wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing. I thought about being a wedding consultant. Since then I have been working my ass of reading about acting, trying to find an agent, watching play, analyzing them, watching movies more often, becoming more outgoing, and ofcourse actually acting in plays. I've learnt that CharActors is a great place which as helped me with my self confidence and taught me many things!! Im proud to be a student of CharActors!! That is basically my whole theory of Charactors and how those things then have helped become the person I am today.   I've had the dream of becoming an actress since I was 6 and a half to be exact. I was just like my little brother is now. I think he will make a good actor some day. He keeps telling me that he doesn't want to be an actor, he wants to be a director. But I know he will get into acting quickly. He is adorable!!   Now onto my love life. I love my family, friends, and all that ofcourse!! But I know there is someone special out there just right for me who is into what I am into. Who is caring, sweet, sensitive, funny, outgoing, and NOT SELF ABSORBENT. I thought I found my true love almost 6 months went by when I was drowned in love. The last month I found out so much about him that A) I didn't need to know in the first place and b) that hes a sick bastard. Then all my friends started to go out with him EVEN THOUGHT THEY TOLD ME BEFORE THEY HATED HIM. You know, sometimes I hafta just sit there and WONDER. Do people go out with people just to be called their lover or their BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND?? huh?? well.. I was soon to figure out that for myself. Because of these many incidents with all my friends dating this one peverted freak, I learnt the meaning of the word love. Now when I look at 2 ppl I can tell if its real, or fake. Like when my good friend and this perverted freak were talking to eachother, just the tone in her voice said enough. This makes me sick!!! And the gross thing is that they don't even admit to loving him at anytime. Its to sad. Then once they first start going out she says, " Well, actually when I first met him, I loved him right away".. BS!! SHE always told me before how much she hated him and how she would promise not go out with him. HE ALSO IS THIS ASIAN PORN FREAK. Sometimes I try to think y I even liked him.
