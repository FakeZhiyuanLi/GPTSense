       Okay, yeah, I know...random title...but there is a meaning...      Today, Mom and I were sitting together in the den watching Pulp Fiction. You know, a typical mother-son moment. Anyway, Mom, in a random act so typical of her personality, decided she wanted a Dairy Queen Blizzard. So, both of us in our pajamas, we loaded into the Trailblazer and drove off, listening to a CD of 70's "Women Who Rock" because Mom had been inspired to listen to retro-style music after watchign the Dance Contest scene in Pulp Fiction. So we drove off to the DQ on South 14th. When we got there, we found a huge drive-thru line, and since, as I previously mentioned, we were both in our PJs, we could not go inside, so we sat, Blondie blasting out of the speakers, waiting as the line of worthless fellow DQ visitors slowly dwindled. It was then that I noticed a couple sections of an old newspaper laying on the floorboard of the car. I picked up the Life Section, and turned to the comics because, yes, I am that pathetic. I read and read, becoming more and more disappointed at just how LAZY the writers have become. I mean, WAY too many cheesy metaphors and overused jokes. Many strips I read leave me not laughing, but rather very angry at how horribly ridiculous it was that I just wasted 15 seconds of my life reading that worthless piece of shit. I think, "they got PAID to publish this!?" Eventually, to make sense of the title of this column, I came to the popular comic strip "Dennis the Menace." This strip is "okay" at best usually, but this one caught my attention in particular. In it, Dennis is walking up to his father, holding out a thick book. He proclaims "Look, Dad! I colored all of Grandpa's black and white photos!"       ...      What the FUCK is wrong with that kid? Then again, who the FUCK thought this comic strip would be REMOTELY amusing?? Okay, okay, I'll admit, they were aiming to make Dennis appear to seem innocently curious and cute. However, stop for a moment and just think about what is actually happening in this situation: Dennis has obviously just finished DESTROYING all of his Grandfather's priceless photographic memories. Now, as far as I know, the Grandfather is still alive int he strip, but what happens when he dies? Almost a century of hard work and effort went into making himself a success, and, in turn, ensuring the stability of life for his son and grandson. This poor old man probably lived through a World War or maybe two, a dozen or more Presidents, and countless other experiences most pussies in modern America can only dream of having to endure. And this worthless little ungrateful shit of a grandson,  Dennis , effectively destroyed all of his old-time memories with a few strokes of a marker, crayon, or whatever the fuck kids use to draw these days. The photos are probably too badly damaged to be restored of saved, and probably would do better being thrown out. So, in essence, a 6 year old little asshole brat destroyed his Grandfather's memories and his legacy. Now, when the grandfather is long dead and buried, no one will be able to look back at his photos and say "this man lived once, and he lived a great life." He will be forgotten by all eventually, no one ever knowing or caring he existed all because that little fucker was being "cute." Now, I ask you again, who on earth thinks that is funny? Why in the HELL is that considered a "comic?" the word comic generally makes me think of something funny. The destruction of the history of a member of the Greatest Generation is not what I consider to be main-stream or even side-stream humor. That little fucker Dennis needs to be caned. Have you ever watched that episode of Jackass where they all get smacked in the ass with a bamboo stick? That's what they need to do to Dennis, only in his case, smack the bastard in the face. Better yet, sharpen the cane and plunge it into his eyes, then set him loose, screaming, blind and bloody, into the back yard. Preferably, there should be a large, deep swimming pool with no gate around it in the yard. Go out and catch him a day or two later, that is, if he's still alive, and bring him inside, where, by now, you should have created a bamboo garden in a room of the house. While the bamboo is still very young and short, tie Dennis, stomach down, over the plants, his arms and legs spread apart, being pulled by ropes tied to poles at the four corners of the room. If you aren't aware, many types of bamboo are capable of growing at a rate of up to 1 foot every day. Therefore, assuming the average room in a house is 10 feet high, if you tie Dennis roughly 3 feet fromt he ceiling, and the bamboo is 1 foot high when you tie him up, it should take 6 to 7 days for the bamboo to grow up and through his frail, soft body. If he looks drained of blood from his burst eye sockets, you might want to shove some cotton balls or a sponge in there to ensure the bamboo does the killing and not the trivial little wounds on his face. And also, if he looks like he is ready to starve to death, it would be acceptable to feed him enough to sustain life for the 6 to 7 days necessary for the bamboo to reach him. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Take this opportunity to take photos of Dennis being punctured and slowly killed. Once he is dead and forgotten, and you have had new, better, more well-disciplined children, it would be customary to post the photos of Dennis dying all around the house, especially on the refrigerator. Make sure the new kids know what happens when they fuck with Grandpa's legacy.       In conclusion, I hate kids who destroy stuff, especially irreplacable herlooms and keepsakes, and people try to pass it off as precoscious. It's not cute, it's not funny, and it's not acceptable. Fuck Dennis.      Later...

       Well, well, well...This is me      Keith Robert Taillon      Yeah, yeah, this is boring as hell, but you know you're just bored enough to read it...you pathetic sack of crap...      Anyway, to start off, like I said, I am Keith Robert Taillon. I was born August 13th, 1987 in Plattsburgh, New York to Judy and Rob Taillon. I have one sister, Sarah, who is 2 years older than I.       Well, my mom was born in New York City, my dad in Bristol, Connecticut, and they met each other in Plattsburgh, New York. Mom was studying to be a speech pathologist at Plattsburgh State University and Dad was stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base. Anyway, blah blah blah, skip ahead to 1984, they get married; in 1985, Sarah Eileen was born, and 2 years later, a magnificent occurance...occured...      I WAS BORN...*heavenly music plays*      Yeah yeah...well, we lived in 2 Plattsburgh AFB houses before moving off-base into a little 3-bedroom house in town. In 1990, Dad was shipped off to serve in Operation Desert Storm, during which time Mom, Sarah, and I went and lived with Mom's parents in NYC. Once Dad got back home in 1991, we were informed that we had to be transferred to another base within the year and we had to move either to Charleston, South Carolina or Abilene, Texas. Obviously, we chose Abilene. Shortly after moving, Plattsburgh AFB was permanently shut down.      We got to Abilene in the middle of the summer of 1991. Now, keep in mind that Plattsburgh was literally 30 minutes from the Canadian border at the very far north end of New York. So, in a word, it was cold all the time. A hot day was when it was 75. So, we, a bunch of cold-blooded yankees, stepped out of our car into the 110-degree Texas summer heat and instantly knew we were in Hell. Anyway, I attended 4-year-old Preschool on Dyess AFB for a year. It was during this year that I remember getting my first time-out for going to the bathroom without permission. Me, being a little pansy, cried inconsolably. We moved into a little house on Corsicana Avenue, just down the street from what would later be Clack Middle School (it wasn't built until after we moved in). After Preschool, I entered Kindergarten at Bassetti Elementary in its inaugeral year. I stayed there for 2 years until, in 1993, we moved onto Dyess AFB. So, for 2nd grade, I went to Dyess Elementary. Somewhere along the line in 1993, my dad's dad died of a heart attack, but I was too young to really have memories of it.       It was toward the end of my 2nd grade year that my dad decided to retire from the Air Force. After he did so, we once again moved, this time to New York City to live with my grandparents. Mom took a job teaching in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a notoriously seedy area near Newark. Dad acquired a job with a company that did exterior work on skyscrapers, such as hanging flags and erecting flagpoles as well as gold leafing rooves and the like. He did work at the Trump Building, Yankee Stadium, and even the World Trade Center. While in NYC, Sarah and I attended Our Lady of Good Council Catholic School; she in 5th grade, I in 3rd. It was a traditional Catholic school, one in which we had to wear uniforms, pray before school and meals, etc. Mom had gone there all the way from Kindergarten through 8th grade, at which time all kids have to leave and enter either private or public High School. However, we didn't have it as easy as we would have liked in New York, so we made the decision to move AGAIN to Abilene to pick up Texas life where we left off. Sarah and I finished out our school years, and we moved back to West Texas. That summer, in 1996, my dad's mom died of cancer. I was still young, but I was old enough to cry and to know she wasn't coming back. It was the first and only funeral I have ever been to.      For 4th grade, I was enrolled at Allie Ward Elementary, and Sarah was at Madison Middle School in the 6th grade. We lived in the Warwick Apartments for a short time while house hunting. We eventually found our present address on Woodlake Drive, and we've been here ever since.      I am now a Senior at Cooper High School. Sarah is going to begin classes at Hardin-Simmons University here in town in the Fall. Mom is still working for the AISD, and Dad has a job at the US Postal Service's Mail Processing Center on the north end of town. As of now, I have been to 27 US States, 2 Canadian Provinces, and 5 Countries. I have excelled somewhat in both music and art, as well as academics. My goals for life as of right now remain a large question mark. I plan to apply to the 3 in-town Universities along with several private Universities across Texas and the US. I guess I'll have to wait and see where the wind blows me next Fall.       Anyway, I guess if you have any more sordid questions for me, you'll have to ask personally because I don't think I can come up with anything else that's not too boring, too hard to explain, or too personal to post online. So I suppose just hit me up on AIM...      Til then...Later...

         First of all, let me be the first to proclaim from the hilltops the gayness that is a "blog," which is why I am also going to tell you that what this is to me, is simply a place where I can write as much as I want, whenever I want, and not be restricted by the limits of a subprofile. I don't know how long this thing'll last with me, being how bad I am with commitment to keeping up with stuff, but I'll give it a shot as long as I stay interested in it.          Alright, now that that's out of the way, let me tell you a story. Yesterday, August 4th, 2004, was Senior Registration day at Cooper High School. Mr. Sisco assured all of the seniors in Band that when we went to registration, for efficiency purposes, all Band students were to be whisked to the front of the line, processed, and sent home as quickly as possible. So after Band at 1:15 or so, a couple dozen of us Band seniors wandered to the Cafeteria. The line was, literally, one of the longest I had ever seen in my life. As in, it honestly would have taken multiple hours to make it all the way through. So we, needless to say, were very relieved, safe with the knowledge that we'd be allowed to the front of this atrociously long line. Right? Wrong. We walked in to find a table set up with three, fat, underpayed, balding men with an ego bigger than their beer guts seemingly watching the doors and passing out papers and pencils. Obviously they work for their money. Fat assholes. Immediately our hopes for being moved to the front of the line were dashed, as the fat fuckers continuously yelled, telling us to take the paperwork, fill it out, and get to the back of the line. I, along with several other people, complained for a while before goign to the Band Hall in an attempt to get Mr. Sisco to help us straighten things out. Ha ha. I know. We're stupid. So, when we finally get ahold of Sisco in his office, he looks outraged and a little nervous at the news we brought him, and hurriedly whipped out a white form stating that all summer activities students were to be allowed to register early, as in, on August 3rd. Sadly, Sisco either did not realize it was the 4th or didn't quite grasp the concept of having all the summer students registering on one separate day, and we seemed to be shit out of luck. So I meandered back to the Cafeteria, took the 3 forms and a pencil, and sat down to fill them out. As I began to write, I got madder and madder because I was  supposed  to go to the Abilene Regional Airport and help greet Anne, our new foreign exchange student from Germany. However, it wasn't until I stopped and actually looked around to see why we were waiting for so long that I  really  got mad. It appeared as if we were waiting in a 250-person line for the sole purpose of getting all of our pictures taken for school IDs. Now, I know what you're thinking, "why the hell is that such a problem?" Well, I'll give you an answer to your query: There were 2 cameras. Yes, my friends. TWO FUCKING CAMERAS FOR ALMOST 300 IRRITABLE, CRANKY SENIORS AND THEIR PARENTS. Let me give you even more of a taste of my frustration: While those 2 assholes sat at their 2 cameras and took 2 pictures every 5 minutes...there were 3 cheerleaders, COUNT THEM, THREE cheerleaders collecting ID money, roughly 5 choir people running a vending station where shirts and other CHS shit was being peddled, and, as you hopefully recall, THREE fat old fuckers guarding the doors. Not to mention the 5 or 6 cheerleaders who had been put in charge of collecting the forms those fatass balding fuckers had so fervently been guarding. So, obviously, this registration experience had been MARVELOUSLY planned out by the staff at Cooper High School. So, if you took time to count it all up, there were roughly 15 or more people in the Cafeteria doing work that required MAYBE 4: 1 fatass old man to hand out forms, 1 cheerleader to collect money, 1 cheerleader to collect forms, and 1 choir person to sell shit. This leaves more than 10 people who, as I have just proven, were, in essence, dispensable from their assigned positions in the Cafeteria. Why not splurge and acquire 10 more cameras, get these 10 disposable assholes to learn to take pictures, and move this fucking MASSIVE line along faster than a snail's pace. Maybe then things would move along much more smoothly. But, alas, 98% of the staff at CHS is 50 times stupider than I am, and thus unable to function as useful additions to society in general. I hate them.     Anyway, once I got through this line, I had to go get my schedule. I found, to my great dismay, that I had not been placed in AP Art History, and, in a stroke of genius on behalf of the counselling staff, had instead been placed in Business Management and Business Ownership. You KNOW there'll be some real winners in those classes. So I had to go see the senile Mrs. Dick (I've grown immune to laughing at her name...some things are just too blatantly funny to laugh at for very long...) and have my schedule reworked to rid myself of those fabulous business classes and get into something more worthwhile. In the end, I settled on moving my Health class to 7th period and picking up Sociology to mirror it 2nd Semester, thus leaving 1st period empty. I decided to, instead of taking a 2nd off period, pick up German I, and try out a 3rd language. I figured why the hell not. If it's too hard, I'll just drop out. I mean, I've already got 2 years of Spanish under my belt, so German is supposed to be just for fun. Eh, whatever. Anyway, my schedule for 2004-05 is as follows:    A1 - German 1      A2 - AP US Govt (AP Economics 2nd Semester)    A3 - Band    A4 - AP European History    B1 - AP English 4    B2 - Health (Sociology 2nd Semester)    B3 - Band    B4 - OFF PERIOD    Let me know if we've got any classes together...         Well, I'm tired of writing for now, so I suppose...Later...
