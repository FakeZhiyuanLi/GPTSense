      Hi folks  This represents my latest attempt to keep up with the times.  I thought we might use the site to post details of assignments, links, tips and shared help.  Let me know what you think.  I suppose if we find it helpful we can extend it to the HL English.  Of course, we can still use e-mail but this is a way of whole group sharing ideas and I'm afraid I don't want to use Messenger for this kind of thing.  Hope to see your comments soon.

      Hallo y'all  It's the first time I've ever written a blog.  Hmm... I suppose I'm venturing into the realm of the unknown. :P   I'm still in England... Can't wait to get back home, I arrive on Monday :D.    Anyway, touring Nuts sounds good, I agree it would be good to develop it, as I think we didn't explore it fully.  I saw 'Guantanamo' last night in London, which was amazing.  Any of you who are coming to England see it!   Hope everyone is having fun...   Bjs, Viki

      Hello Scullyman, and the rest of you,  I like the idea of using a blog to keep in touch... it's great. Like we're still at school. yay.  Good luck with getting the schools interested, I dont see why they shouldn't be.  I've been thinking about the production, and maybe there are a couple things we could do to beef it up. You said you've been thinking about the Peanuts thing, what did you have in mind? What might be interesting would be to put james in a Charlie Brown-esque t-shirt (orange with diamonds) or maybe even to make the prison guards uniforms more remeniscent... I dont know. Just throwing out ideas.  I'm still in NYC, staying with my brother, with relatively good internet access, so I should be able to get on often, but I'll be home on tuesday, when I can be online ALL THE TIME (because I'm cool)  Anyway, I thought I'd just drop a line, say hi, kudos for the wikkid site and hope it becomes a real source for up to date TArts info. If you want help spicing it up (newer design, more features etc)  let me know, I've been using blogger for some time now. fika bem, Geert

      Had a bit of a good look at the various schools in Madrid.  I've written speculative mails to four of them and am ging up to Porto next week to see Mark Shaw and see if he can swing something for us.  The idea is to get about 3/4 performances.  Also read quite a bit on Fausto today though in Italian so could only get about 60% of it.  Lots of thoughts about Peanuts...  Margarida said she's tried to post but had problems.  Have a go.  If you're struggling try going to www.blogger.com and see what you can do.  Enjoy.
