      I have realized that I spend every single day being tired. And I am willing to bet that 9 out of 10 people reading this are tired as well. Maybe there aren't 10 people that read this though! Why is it that we spend most of our lives being tired? I get 8 hours of sleep a night, I exercise on a regular basis, so why am I chronically tired? Please tell me if you have any good tips on how to beat the fatigue!  By the way, for those of you who aren't bloggers, you can post comments anonymously, just make sure you add your name to the bottom of your comment so I'll know who it is.  Today's goals: 1. Study 2 hours for GMAT 2. Hmmm. I think my first goal is going to be enough of a challenge!  I am getting excited to go to MN at the end of September. I know it's a long way off, but I need to have something to look forward to. I am especially looking forward to going to the Mall of America with my step-dad. He's loves the mall. Just kidding Al! He has had the misfortune of picking me up from the airport the last few times and I have lured him into the MOA with promises of gourmet coffee.  I have been operating on a fairly strict budget here. Well, strict for me. I still manage to set aside $100 a month for going out to eat, mochas, etc. I am going to try to stick to it for the next year to pay off my debt and start saving for b-school. Except for when I go to MN. I plan on spending some money at the MOA, a girl has got to keep up with fashion! See Laura's post on UNC-Chapel Hill fashion from August 19th.  urlLink http://stevenlaura.blogspot.com   Ok. I have to go get more coffee now so I don't yawn my way through meetings today. I might have a meeting at 9 pm tonight! Don't the Nortel people in Asia know that I go to bed at 9 pm? Probably not!

      Since my 2 NC friends have blogs (Steve and Laura), I thought I would jump on the wagon too. Remember how Garfield hates Monday's? Well, I have decided that he is the world's smartest cat. (Except for my childhood pet Tabby of course. ) I started out this Monday by losing my badge to get in to my work building. Luckily I was still able to get in.  I feel like I was a little bit of a slacker this weekend. I only studied for my GMAT for an hour! I did get a lot of household chores done though. You can always tell if I have had studying to do because my apt. will be cleaner. Something about picking the lesser of two evils! For anyone reading this who doesn't know, I am scheduled to take the GMAT (again) on Sept. 25th. I took it last April but wasn't completely happy with the results. Well, I was happy with them until I started researching Kenan-Flagler Business School more and realized I should have a much higher score than I do. So now I have two study guides and 5 weeks to get through them. I will definately be disappointed if I do worse this time!  This weekend was pretty fun. Especially because I didn't have to cook at all! Friday night I went out. Saturday night was Mexican Fiesta with Laura and Steve, and last night Christie (my cousin who just moved to NC) cooked for me. There's an interesting side note. Do you think NC is getting nervous with all of us MidWesterners moving out here? 4 of us have moved here since July.  Please post comments if you read this because I like to know that people are interested in my life!
