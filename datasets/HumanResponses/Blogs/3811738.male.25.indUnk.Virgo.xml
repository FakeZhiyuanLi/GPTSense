         Sometimes I wonder if anybody ever has understood what project management is all about! As long as we do forward scheduling with a deadline in mind and execute tasks sequentially we should logically be getting there on time but that seldom happens! Is there any reason for us to believe that project scheduling ever works. Yes it does, but only in cases where the resources are only machines, humans are either too complicated or too stupid to stick to a schedule and when they do try to do that, they act like dumb machines! So we probably need to start considering backward scheduling with human behavior in mind rather than forward scheduling treating humans as machines.

      It is pretty amazing when you come to think of the very nature of humans when it comes to relationships. Human Relationships, in my humble opinion is very different than any other animal relationships on our planet earth. The tendency of the human to get into a relationship seems to have evolved from the time humans were nomads. The habit of recognizing and forming bonds with other humans/animals has come a long way in the human civilization. Although our relationships are complex they can still be divided into two basic forms: The ones that we choose to have and the other that we do not. The ones that we choose to have are the ones that we enjoy being in, they are primarily based on love and dependencies rather than just dependency. I would cite marital relation as one relation that most of the humans actually view as a wanted or chosen relationship. The relationship between the parent and the child is debatable though. As per my modern world observations, Parent/Child relationships are chosen from the parent side and dependency driven from the child's side. No matter how you might want to argue, relationships are generally viewed differently (in some cases more than the others) by both the parties involved. A workplace relationship also falls under the category of not by choice relationships. What is intriguing though is that only humans have shown this tendency to form explicit long term relationships. All other animals even if they form societies do not (seem to) form long term relationships that are as interwoven as ours. So what bearing does a relationship have over human existence? Does it serve any other purpose apart from making our lives complicated?  This is something that requires more pragmatic analysis than one might imagine. As many I have observed might argue that relationships are the very basic element that drives the human collaboration and hence the progress made by the race, history, reveals a very different concept. There have been no wars observed until now among any other living creature on earth apart from humans. If humans lacked the ability to form relationships they would never have any attachments/emotions in their lives thus averting the very need to enforce their superiority or just make their point! Yes, there are good sides to relationships too, the joy of one can be best expressed by a couple in love or by two people who collaborated at work to achieve greatness in their field yet it cannot debase the argument about the value a relationship adds versus the misery it can cause, either for you or for me or worse still for all of us.

      I have often wondered why AI could never cross the barriers of sci-fi and become a reality when it sounds so logical. Why could we never realize anything that AI promised when the scientists first proposed the concept? The crux of the problem lies in the very definition of the concept itself. If intelligence were to be definable and a process could be established for achieving the same then why would we ever have a mediocre person in the world. Isn't it very obvious that there is no practical all encompassing definition of intelligence yet??!! Why do we even try to analyze intelligence as an entity as compared to it being an attribute. Is intelligence related to the development of the brain? Is it related to pure exposure and the whims and fancies of hebbian learning?! If it was, then how and why do we distinguish between two regular students of the same class? It is plain simple that intelligence cannot be algorithimized. It is at best describable in terms of patterns of thoughts through the brain whereby a better quality of intelligence optimizes the result better. How could a thought pattern be defined then? Why can't two thought patterns be similar? They could be similar only when the guiding principle of genetics of the organism is similar. Now coming back to the primordial question - why have we not been able to realize AI? Because we never tried to understand how the brain works in conjunction with the genetic code of the organism. We always tried to generalize the behavior of the brain and tried to mathematicalize based on assumptions of what a complex system like it could function like. Another approach tried was of trying to understand how the brain learns logic and trying to package it in a generic form as a form of intelligence. The answer to true AI does not lie in generalization but in the realization of the fact that genetic variance and control applied to the evolution of the each unique system such as an artificial brain is one of the most logical approaches to closing the gap between the artificial and the real masterpiece of nature - the brain!
