         overnight trains are the best. i was amazed at how well i slept, given that there were 6 people crammed into the very small room, lined with bunks. but i was out for pretty much all 6 hours from zurich to paris, and the same on the return. in the interim, we managed to tour many of the places one should go as a first-time tourist in paris.  saturday was filled with  urlLink notre dame , with its  urlLink crucifixes  and  urlLink stained glass ; followed by the louvre, where i found this great renaissance statue of  urlLink john butler  (from the  urlLink john butler trio ); and then finally by a trek up to montmartre and the  urlLink sacre-couer cathedral .   after battling with the other tourists in the latin quarter on saturday night, sunday was just as full-on. we powered through the champs elysee (past $10 cappuccinos), to the  urlLink arc de triumph , and down to the  urlLink tour eiffel .  urlLink climbing up  was fun, and the  urlLink views  were  urlLink interesting . and  urlLink pretty cool  in  urlLink other directions  as well.   nice weekend. busy, but full of all those great tourist oppurtunities. now i can feel free to find the more interesting spots on my next visit.         urlLink

      pouring rain, clear blue. it alternated all day long in zurich today. luckily i was inside for all the wet bits, except for on my way home, which just made the riding even more fun! found some more awesome single track in zurichberg, although it gets a bit tricky when the nobbly tree-roots are slick from the rain. since it was a bit cooler i could try out my snazzy new cycling top for the first time as well, and it made me feel so much faster! and it's got much more cred now that it's a bit mud-splattered.

      in the last week of june,  urlLink hiren ,  urlLink fredrik  and i went to see, hear and admire  urlLink laura imbruglia  at the fabulous  urlLink vanguard  in newtown. being a very small venue, the only seats we could get were in the very front row centre. how awesome was that - a bit of neck craning is a small price to be so close to an acoustic performance! laura was cute and full of folk punk as usual (and hiren was rather smitten).   we'd never heard of the main act, clare bowditch, but it was obvious from her very first song that she was something special. songs so longing, honest and simply beautiful we could only sit, stare, and try to keep from both crying and smiling in wonder. fredrik got himself a singed cd after the show, and was assured by clare that she had appreciated the friendly faces in the front row! so we were both head over heels in love, that was that.  only now clare's published an  urlLink open letter  on her site, and we're not sure which way to take it (if we should take it any way at all).   i think we both still love her though :)

      i was planning on getting up super-early and heading south to climb my first 3000m swiss mountain. but sleep seemed like much the better option at 6:30am. it was a scorcher of a day too, so lazing around at home was a sensible choice i think. got a fair bit closer to having the few manuscripts i'm writing from my work at  urlLink proteome systems  finished as well. will be great when they're actually finished! a very nice run through honggerberg and kaferberg forests saved me from a completely lazy day as well. i'm most impressed that someone's already left a comment about my blog too. go  urlLink hiren !

      the swiss sure now how to have a low-key national day. even the australia day-style bbqs were missing, although it's a perfect season for it (midsummer, and long, warm evenings). the concessions to celebration were some performances of the swiss national anthem and plenty of fireworks (the week leading up to august 1 is the only time it's legal to buy and sell fireworks in switzerland, so everyone makes the most of it!). impressive fireworks late in the evening made for a fun ending to the day, but i think the swiss dogs were as unimpressed as any by all the loud noises.

      i had a bit of an adventure with swiss alpine cheese friday night. i've been making it my small mission to get through as many different kinds of swiss chocolate and cheese as i can, and so was trying out the swiss speciality - super tasty cheese made fresh from unpasteurised milk up in the alpine pastures where the cows spend their very pleasent summers. only i think it was the 'unpasteurised' which was the problem. the cheese itself was very tasty indeed, but i think there was too much of it topping my tomato, tofu, and vegie sauce, and whatever nasties that were along for the ride, were too much for my stomach to cope with. so friday night was not so fun. i suppose i only have myself to blame though, since the cheese was 'reduced for quick-sale' at the supermarket...
