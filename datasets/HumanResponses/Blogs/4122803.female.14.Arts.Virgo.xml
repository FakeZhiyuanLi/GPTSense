      ...hell of an elevator. yes. well, last night, Katie, Soaps, Holly and I slept at Hannah's house. we went in their pool in the dark  : o~ twas so fun... i have such funneeh photos but THIS DAMN "HELLO!!!!!" PICTURE UPLOADER WILL NOT LET ME DO IT!! ArrrrRrrrggGGggghHHHhh!! Hannah rules. haha.  Me, Katie and Soph were hungry so we went down to Hannah's kitchen and they opened the cupboard and there was a picture of the cast of Shrek2 and Fionas stupid face was making me laugh sooo much they had to put their hands over my mouth. in the morn, we caught the 'booked bus' to aston fields and NEIL HAHAHHAHAHAH was on there with DREW WYLDE/WILD however you spell it HAHAHHA . then, we got off and i was all excited b/c of the rain. well, holly kt n hana went into brum on the train.. hold on this bit may sound dodgy: ***then, we got off***...i meant OFF THE BUS believe me, that would not excite me. but hey yeah, so me n soph didnt wanna go into brum (again) so we started walking home b/c the rain had eased off a tiny bit. but then it started raining soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much we just got wet. very very wet. i went I WOULD RUN HOME BUT I AM WEARING FLIPFLOPS so i took them off and ran barefoot, which was very painful. i am not that light, especially when i am running with heavy luggage and a sleeping bag. i had to dodge rain-pounded poos, since the rain was makin them fly up in spatters. tastyyyy. NOT me n soph had to change when we got home. soph was scared tom was gona burst in. he didnt. well he did but that was later in the day, and we were upstairs by then. me n soph watched most of  Alice In Wonderland. haha, we got to see our parts from our Primary School play! soph was the card that paints the roses red and i was the mad hatter's sleepy doormouse. (sp?) aaaaaaaah, the simple pleasures. anyways i have rambled on enough. xxxxxxxxxxx ps- i asked soph if she would like some Ribena...she said yes so i poured it then tried to put it back in the cupboard, and the knob fell off in my hand, so i got angry and rammed the ribena back in and it flew out and exploded everywhere so we had to mop up purple stains (very ironic)

      oooosh. today we all went into Birmingham which was cool cos i got to see everyone after their hols, and they were mostly browned. BUT MAN, DOES SHOPPIN PISS ME ORF. like, not alot fits me cos i have a weird upper body shape, like my backs all curvy and bent... but HEY teehee. i got too annoyed by all the stuff. but this man offered a free haircut at Tony&Guy, and this bloke tried to sell us a minivan. indeed. afterwards, me Lex and Hol walked our lil doggas over the fields, and on the way back we picked Damsens from the tree for Lexs person person (yes, repeated word, intentional). i like walking out with them, they are two very laid-back people. soph rang me to ask if i wanted to go swimming with her, so i rang mom to ask. then i rang soph back and this REALLY SCARY MAN went "Heggo?" And i went, "Um....Hi?" and he went "HEGGO?!" so i whimpered and hung up. then bout 7 mins later he rang up n tom answered n he went "WHO IS THIS?" n tom went "TOM ROOME" duhhhhhh then he asked mom why she rang him n mom was like "i didnt ring u!!!!" n i was tryin to signal to her.... oh,  my god, how embarrassing. strange thing was.... sophs number was programmed in. hmmmm so, me n soaps went swimming and this man came out the sauna and was headed for the steam room, when he slipped on the wet tiles and skidded into the side of the jacuzzi, where he tripped and splooOoshed head first into the Jacuzzi with people in it... it was sooooo funny, he didnt get hurt, so thats good. how are you people? xxxx

Ben Kweller's quite cool actually me and mum walked the dog up a deserted canal. was nice and it was dusk and the sky was light blue, white and pink. it looked exactly like the colouring of the Evian bottles. and now im back on here : s and i have to get up early (ha!!) to catch the train tomorrow to Birmingham (yet again) with Katie, Sophie, Holly and Hannah. Can't wait till we go to Searles! so thats... i went in on thursday, saturday, sunday and monday (tomorrow) i will, of course keep you (hahaha yes you, and that only applies if you  are reading this...which you are, otherwise you wouldnt know this was here) posted. xxxx

      Went into Birmingham with Holly yesterday : ) : ) we had fun even if i bought nothing, n Hol did. But i saw Tom and Jess walking down the one of the streets outside Baguettes Du Monde and i kind of pointed for ages like a loon (sorry) but then when Holly and I were making our way down the high street, Tom caught us up and gave me T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, which is a book of poems from the thirties i think, and it inspired the musical 'Cats'. He had bought it for me (i think!) i was sooo pleased! i stayed up for a while in the tent reading them to Holly until i figured she was annoyed and stopped. Hol went to sleep, then for a while i just stayed up listening to the rain spatting and pattering the canvas violently for a while. I was listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers, but i got lonely so i texted Tom since i knew he would be awake...but he didn't reply surprisingly since he was drunk. oops, a huge moths flying around my lamp, so i just turned it off. well, this morning when i woke up i moved my head, and my cat attacked it from the other side of the canvas.  Thanks, Amber. Holly slept in, so i went and got my other cat, Smudge, and he sniffed her face n she woke up n her face was all funny hahahaha. we then went n ate hot buttered toast in our pjs and watched as told by ginger. only true friends can do that! i tidied my room for the rest of the day, until after tea me n tom went to David Lloyds which was fun. me and Ollie had a go at song-writing today...i suck! i can manage poetry, but there's something very different about the two. stay healthy happy and starry for me, please. xxxx   ps- today in that huge storm we had, i just stood outside in the rain until i got a chill i think. My pants became very wet. (ew that sounds bad to someone who is weird)

      went to a funeral today, then went to my mum's auntie and uncle's house. they r soo cool! they rock. plus they r called Margerie and Clifford which rocks. Tom had to wear his suit, but my laughiness subsided when the sun came out and i was dressed all in black. i think i am going to go on a break from the Chilis (as recommended by Tom) otherwise i won't like them any longer. i need someone new to become obsessed with!    PLEASE HELP, I NEED SOMEONE?           i really would like to know...      WHO DO YOU THINK IS SEXIER?   Usher or Anthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers) Britney or Charlotte Hatherley (ASH) stupid question, but i would like to know why people think that pop-people are sexy just cos they like to 'pimp people out' or dance round half naked..? anyone know?fill me in!   DO YOU PREFER..?   late nights and late rises late nights and early rises early nights and late rises early nights and early rises   WHAT TIME DO YOU GO TO BED?          sorry for the weird questions!       Uhm... yeah. I wish i had more to say. And some interesting things for you. But i don't, really. Unless i write down random thoughts i had today;      *I don't want to get up and go out yet.     * Have i put too much eyeliner on?     * FOR GOD'S SAKE!! why don't i have any decent black skirts?!     * When i get back home, i want to start writing a song. But i can never come up with a good tune. How do people do it? I can handle the words and poetry, making them lyrics, but it's just the tune. And the music... oh dear.     *My knees don't look as knobbly as they normally do.     *Did Tom just compliment me?     *I think i'll go and paint something. Hold on...where have i put my canvas paper? where are my paints? Oh yes.. i hid them when the painter came so he wouldn't see my paintings..          .... and i still don't have a clue where i have hidden them.     Don't you hate it when you find something that you know you will find useful in the future, so you put it away, where you will 'remember' where it is? then you completely forget that place?   I do. until next time, ciao! xxx and purlease help me on my quest to find the answers to the questions i asked you. ;)

      eeep, i feel bad cos i havent talked to mon dearest Holly in a while, but i'm no good at phone conversations, and she has no credit and i'm too lazy and stupid to go out. i need to talk to her tho cos of her ratrat : ( holly, if you read this just go on msn, it's where i talk the most Oh yes, imagine how cool it would be to have a rockstar boyfriend, (unless you are male, THEN imagine having a rockstar girlfriend) okay there would be the tours and their busy lifestyles and stuff, but it would still be cool. i bet now i will probably marry an accountant. but that would be too boring! i'm gonna keep living the dream in the hope that some boy who i find goodlooking, even though no-one else does, wanders into my room rockin' hahahaha. you never know... ;) felt too poorly to go to drums yesterday, so Leo didnt get paid, bless him that kitten lovin' drum trippin' tattoo wearin' bundle of scaredness ( i think i worry him) i stayed at home feeling sorry for myself in the sun, until i overheated and zoomed upstairs. me n tom jus went to dls (swimmin) in the morn. Brandy's such a cool song, but her name sounds like a prostitute. a red-headed prostitute. today i am just sitting around. me n tom watched That 70s Show for a bit. i would give you some meaningful views, but i dont have many at the moment. i don't have strong views towards many things, as i prefer to let things wash over me. which is very cowardly, but i just do. but, i suggest that on clear nights, you take an hour or so, even 5 minutes if you don't have time, to just star-gaze. the clear night sky is so beautiful. you can just sit there on the floor in the cool night air with the puddles of the passed rain soaking up through your clothes and on to your skin. it seems so quiet and still, you even start to block out the noise of passing cars, motorbikes, mopeds, or pigs, depending on where you live. It makes you think about alot of things. About whether you are; Lonely and wishing you would find something that people call 'soul mate'. Happy and thankful for what you have got and having the time and privilege to be able to just sit there and watch the sky. Planning what you want to happen in the next episode of your life. Wishing you hadn't locked yourself outside. But i recommend it. It clears your head out slightly, but also makes you ask philosophical questions which can be confusing. Okay, on to something a little lighter, i have been dying to know;    WHO DO YOU THINK IS SEXIER?       Usher or Anthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers)       Britney or  Charlotte Hatherley (ASH)       stupid question, bu i would like to know why people think that pop-people are sexy just cos they like to 'pimp people out' or dance round half naked..? anyone know?       fill me in! and until next time's stupidly long and longly stupid post, keep healthy and happy, and starry :)       xxxxx

      Tom and Mom went to London today-invitation only...so me and Dad went into Birmingham, and it was so fun! Even though it was so hot and stuffy and busy on the train we chatted and stuff, and all through our day we just laughed at the random people in Birmingham and stuff, and you know those people who shove leaflets at your face cos they reckon you are old enough to go to a club/bar or sad enough to care? well this woman giggled and sed *here's one  BITCH!* and i just sed "thanks" cos i thought she'd said *heres BONDAGE!* and i jus walked orf. yes, well anyway. me and dad played drums/guitar c'etait trop cool. :) afterwards, because me n dad had bought Red Hot Chili Peppers LIVE IN HYDE PARK and Mother's Milk, we spent the next hour listening to it, before he dropped me off at Lauren Saville's house for her party thing. Even though i was always going to go, i wasn't sure about going because i don't know that lot that well, but it was fun. There was the booze, movies etc and then i went outside, looked up at the sky, which, for once was starry as there havent been many recently, and i just looked up at this patch of sky, and this gorgeous shooting star silently drifted by, leaving a spankly dusting of yellow sparks behind it, which faded in a golden streak. It must have been so violent up there, as it pushed its way into the atmosphere, battling as it caught fire and burnt up...and from way down on earth, in a dark garden, from where i was watching it...it just looked so graceful and peaceful. it made me feel sad thinking about how lonely it is up there... but i was happy to see it, because i have never experienced one before that time, and i was the only one to see it...makes it stupidly special in my head! (this was written a day after cos of the 'party' and i wasn't at a computer as you may tell!)

       "I see you in the park, you're always wearing dodger blue, back-doggin' me and anyone from any other crew..."     .....is this some sort of paedo song? who cares! it's cool, one u can do the knees to. it's a wiggly song.   anyways, c'est   mon anniversaire   , 15 septembre, qui est mort cool? les personnes qui est aller a la boum!   yes. for those who don't speak Camilla-French, that says IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, 15TH SEPTEMBER, WHO IS DEAD COOL? THE PEoPLE WHO Go TO THE PARTY!   yes, i am sad. and maybe there will BE no party. but i am working on it.      if their is one then everyone who goes will have to have curly hair!! YES thats a good one. or    Hannah would have to dye hers blue. i don't know. maybe we could all just have a painting party where we all paint tea-cosies. sounds good! Katie will provide the grapes    recently i have i have been exposed to a number of human-duck bonding sessions, and i have to   say... i will approve of these. i mean, no-one normally takes the time to get to know them. but come on, the name Ducky? that's carp! it's what old women call random people who they think are their friends *no offense to Holly who has also been witnessed calling people Ducky* even i    could come up with a better name rather than Ducky. needs work, mon amigos.    anyway, today i woke up from stooOoopid dream with the cat sat on top of me. he wouldnt move so i had to twist my legs in a twatty way to go back to sleep. then, i got up at 12 to have lunch.   then i went back to bed. then i had a FOUR MINUTE SHOWER which was quick. then i got dressed in the garden (only partly) and gave the cat a towel to lie on, which she liked and mewed at me so loudly that my ears hurt so i took it away HAHAHAHA then she went and sat in a bush    and smiled at me with her crazy-loon smile.    nooooooooon Lex est en vacance! et aussi Sophie. Laura lives too far away for me to annoy and whenever i arrange to meet up with Holly i get dragged down by a mental disease which is TRES    ANNOYING. and Katies bogged off somewhere. i think Hannah est a la belle France. MY BUTT!   to the belle part anyway.     msn's numbed my deepness slightly. normally i'd spend my time looking out the window in my  bedroom or the landing, but now i just sit here when i dont have anything to do.   so, yeah. i'll probably post again tonight after me and Lou have been to Pizza hut. i bet LOTS OF FUN STUFF will happen there, like last time the lesbians were sat next to us, and that sixth form boy came out n tried to be FUNNY   anyway, til next time x x x x    i wanna write more but no-one really reads this apart from Loren who is a cool stalker

      HAHA that song makes me laugh. **awwwww baby just for youuuuu, i'd steal anything that u want me tooooooooooo (suck my kiss)** hahahahaha how would you do that?! no graphic details please.    OMG I JUST SAW LIGHTNING even tho the storm ended about 2 n 1/2 hours ago. oh well i can't hear any thunder, i think i am just hyper from eating a nearly expired yoghurt (well, it expires tomorrow actually)    that brings me on to a new subject, why don't people write tomorrow? its just as easy and looks less stupid than 2moz, 2moro, the only acceptable substitute is tomo. use that. and i don't care what fisher boy (tom) says, CARP is the best swearing subsitute as it can be used in class or around perverted little kids who try to feel u up and snog you. and, as i pointed out to Loren, theres a magazine in WHSmiths called TOTAL CARP. very hilarious.    anyway, today i sat at home until Jackman called for Tom which is where i got up and answered the door and spoke about 4 words, then i went and sat down again, then i went upstairs until i heard a Gaz in the household so i went downstairs to tell them it was about to explode (it = the weather) in rain. 5 minutes later it did, and there was another big storm. so then i was standing on the back doorstep watching the storm when i heard a Tom and a Gaz behind me so we all watched it for a bit, then Tom buggered off so i went and splooOooshed around in the puddles for a bit with Gaz watching, then basically for the rest of the evening ive been singing, drawing, and trying to get the cat to play drums on film but she got annoyed and fell off the stool.    so now im on here, n Toms ignoring me on msn to talk to PEOPLE hello IM A PERSON but ive got the one and only Ollie. who's pining for 'Soapz'. i may do something weird out of boredom...like shave my toe even though its not hairy, and you all know its not hairy cos you must have seen me with my shoes off! CAMOU'S SONG FOR THE DAY: Give it Away by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, listen to it! and the boingy boing noises in the background make me laugh....as Leo knows only too well, i had to calmed down...hahahahah *salutes* x x xx

      So, the first installment in my everyday life.    Well, all day i had just been too lazy and slobby and wet from the shower to meet up with my friend, Holly. So i stayed listening to music* and oil painting all day.    Well,  I was disturbed from listening to my Red Hot Chili Peppers* CD by distant thunder, which, in the space of 5 minutes turned to rolls of loud booming thunder ripping across the sky like gunshots. I was making my way downstairs when one screamed out so loud my ears shifted, you know that manky feeling?! So i went outside because i love weather, and tried to record the sound of the thunder, but our annoying dog wouldnt shut up so i got annoyed and went inside, then we lost power. I was standing outside when the downpour came and i was just standing in it. It was lovely! Anyway, after I had watched Futurama with my lovely bro (the power came back on)( urlLink http://www.roomey.blogspot.com/ ) mom asked me to go to Safeway with her. So i did. And when i was their, i saw one of my best friends' boyfriend, John Hall. DUN DUN DUNNN. And then, i mean really, Safeway is just the place to go to get noticed, cos its full of 17-20 year old boys testing out their newly aquired driving skills/cars by going to Safeway. And they were all just STARING at me. according to mom, but what does she know? I personally think that i had something dodgy stuck to my arse like a squished bug or chewing gum.    And since then i have been eating chocolate icecream. Over and out, *salutes* x x x x

      Really, they are.. i mean when you look up into the clear sky at night, studded with stars you don't exactly feel like eating a turnip, do you? Some may do, but i feel nice when i look at them, it's why i am addicted to them, and their crap looking cousins, the abnormally shaped image of what people think stars look like. Other types of stars are those who are famous, but i think they kind of suck, no more or less than the rest of us. They really want to make me eat a turnip. Apart from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, they rule the turnip roost. You may be thinking i like turnips, when actually, i do not. But anyway, i am Camilla or the Rou Rou variety and i am a girl. I will keep you informed of EVERYTHING that happens from now on. x x x x
