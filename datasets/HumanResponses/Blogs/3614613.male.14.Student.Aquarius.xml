						   I spent like, quite a long while to wait for this site to load before anything popped up. Maybe it's only my computer, or maybe ( ugh, I wish ) lots of people are all coming to my site at the same time because it's so popular and there's why even blogspot's server can't support it.  Ah music. I like music. Anyway, I wanted to put up music iwebmusic but I tried going to my own site and this security warning appeared. Remember kids, when ever you see that, always click no. Just in case anyone didn't know and tried to press yes, I removed iwebmusic altogether. Yeah, I do care about my reader's computer health you know?  Almost every paragraph ends in a -_- if you're someone particularly sensitive to bullshit. Anyway, you know the line about "ah-choo, I'm allergic to bullshit"? Well I'm quite tired of hearing that already. It's getting too repetitive, if you get to give me that -_- face in real life where I can see it, think of something else witty to say.  So... It seems that in today's newspaper there's an article on somebody getting an Asia's best blogger award. I forgot what the site is, and I don't think you people care much about that either, so I suppose that doesen't matter. Anyway in it, it's reportedly notorious for dissing about a lot of things.

						           Ah-Hem... I now begin my apology to Tan Li Lin  (her blog) in order to please her royal highness:  Dear Finest Woman On Earth (a.k.a Tan Li Lin)  I humbly ask for your forgiveness, for disregarding your feelings at that particular moment of time, whereby I have created a picture, depicting your face upon a picture of a body builder. I was not thinking clearly and was extremely bored at that point of time, therefore creating that picture. So I'm wracked with guilt, hoping you don't tell your mom about this. Please, just forget about it.  It doesen't mean I'm a bad person.  From Nana.

						   I mean like okay, this is a weekend after all... and I'm so bored. This morning, I went to change the colour of my braces again. This time it's blue. Not any blue though, it's er... baby blue. I look ridiculous, nobody will take me seriously this way! And I didn't choose it, it's my dentist just randomly select for me.  okay chatting with jean now. She sent me a pic of Li lin at junction at, they probably went out there after going to CJC oogling at guys. (jeanie reports that everyone were nerds there, so I guess the li lin's hopes were dashed eh?) In any case, I opened the pic, and I began a staring competition with li lin. She won.  Oh  and the hateful tagboard is gone. Get out. Get out of my site right now.

						   Er right, somehow when I get a chance to post, all that I want to say is gone. Tsk. I should really stop this ridiculous habit, lol. Okay, I'll go through the day's event in school, since school is really what this blog is based on. Civics and Moral education was really really boring today, I'd say it's about as useful to learn it as learning yak acupuncture. And isn't what we learnt today about the Total Defense a form of propaganda? The purpose being to unite the people together. It certainly isn't working on me. I rather watch my toenails grow... and play shooting with Li Lin. Oh and today I used one of Jeanie's Babies as a gun, I pointed the "tail" and held the legs to shoot. It even has sound effects, nations shall tremble when I point that gun and it squeaks. -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-; -_-;  Here's a thought for you 2hians out there. What if beginning of last year, people were not the same people as before? Like for example. Felicia was like Jeanie and vice versa, and Edward was like Joel and vice versa. In that world, Weijin had straight teeth, Li Lin was very lean and tanned, and Ying ying was like what Li Lin is now; white. Then, people like Hwee Kim and Kim N. would be exactly like Havi and Kim A.  If by now you have a clear understand and a vivid imagination, don't you find it weird? I have often played with this idea during extremely boring lessons.

						   Well okay look at the difference between this entry's time and post number 6. time. That's the amound of time I have slept the whole day. Anyway the scout thing is solved already, I have called joel john up and asked him for money. He's the type that would keep a huge store of money, so that it may be spent the next time people like him go out to have fun.  Er let's see, what else? I mean like what can I say there is nothing to say. I have been asleep after all. Oh okay, let's talk about this very site then. I got a new tagboard today, and I can't seeme to find a way so that it fits on the side bar. Looks like everything I want to add from now on will have to fit on top. Nevermind, so long as it works.  Hopefully I'll get my water bottle from jeanie tomorow... And eee, eeerr.... What else? Oh okay, this isn't some kind of court where I have to confirm the testimony of other people but yeah, I did play "shoot shoot" matrix game with li lin. It was like a gulp of sanity in a desolate and barren desert. I read that description somewhere. And er yeah, it WAS fun in a way. I did try doing the neo thing, and pretending to freeze all the bullets she shot and then flick them off the air.  Oh and, if you people haven't noticed this already, Mr. David is losing his confidence... Such a small sentance yet...

						   Oh geez, I really am I really am lazy at scouts... Anyway, I lost 2 scout donation draw booklets. Terrible terrible.. The only consolation is that Mr. Ong called to say that a police report is not necessary. The only difficulty now is, where do I get 40 bucks... 2 booklets is worth $20 each...  I'm trying to borrow from my sister, but if she don't wish to lend me... We'll I'm quite resourceful.  Anyway, today I did CIP again after school... Honestly all that thing about grooming youngsters into becoming responsible and all those caring people are just poppycock. Yep, the word CIP sounds as ridiculous as the word "poppycock", check the dictionary. I learnt that word in an old "Archie" comic. Anyway, today's task was to pick up litter, which I did not. Haviender found a few thrash bags full of litter already, gathered from the bins around the school by one of the janitors already. How convenient. Then after that, I waited for WeiJin to finish his detention, meanwhile talking to the councillers there, persuading them to let weijin go early.  Anyway, the councillor there makes me feel like I'm a very lazy person, which I admit openly and freely. In terms of scouts and studies. But whatever, I still survive don't I?  By the way, this message has been brought to you by blogspot.com and the online writer, websurfie. It has been typed with the aim of either 1.) Making you go tut tut tut, like a priest to a sinful person or 2.) Make you deny that you are not a goody-two-shoes nor are you lazy in studies like me.

						   Today, there was a new teacher to take over Mr. (?? ?? Buck) of science. Name was Mr. Jude David. He's okay, except I notice he has a lot of policies and all those "my standards for this class is..." Are we going to go through that everytime we change teacher?  It's not ususally one of those things you notice AND remember but it's kind of funny to see li lin poking the air just in front of his ah-hem with her ruler. All it needs to top it off is for someone like calvin lim to fan his behinds when he is not looking.  After lots of whining from my family, I removed the pictures of my sister. My father was going through reasons like what if people copy my sis face and paste on naked bodies or something. Yes people, go ahead, give him the -_- or the "...". They are the same anyway, arn't they? What are the chances? But I suppose he can't help it, he's very insecure and we must all be very patient.  I promise this will be the last time I involve my family, EVER. Supposing my mother will bring me to suntec in future, it shall henceforth be simply phrased "I went to suntec", unless you people probe, but I doubt it very much.  Let's see, er I did CIP today... uh, at the D&amp;T workshop, cleaning up. It was one hour only, but then again, I have a huge boon of CIP hours, just ask any scout. And er, after that, walk home with Weijin. I was trying to convince him that he is not clever, and thank goodness I didn't suceed, which makes him a worthy friend, for I don't like the weak minded. Or at least I think I didn't suceed. Haha, well Lin, any snide remarks about how I failed miserably?  And you arh, Jean, please get my bottle tomorow afternoon okay? That ought to be it for today, and er, I decided to update old pictures that are found on my blog, unless they are really really good pictures or they are necessary for the text to make sense.

						   Well I don't live happily ever after after buying that camera you know? Daddy was complaining, (I'd say whining but on second thought I'd better not) over and over again to mommy for letting me get the camera. The point I see in this whole matter is that if even I don't complain, then he has even less right to do so, after all, it's my money. For now, I'll just play with the new toy of mine. I've posted pictures, all of my sister, because she's the only one who is decent enough to be taken and she loves having her cutesy face taken.

						   Well, I got a digital camera today. At suntec. It's really lovely. I like it so much. But I have to stress that it belongs to me and me alone. I paid it with what I saved, so there! Please note that I'm not particularly saying this to anyone, except my family members who may occasionaly borrow it without my permisson.  Oh and of course, this is rather predictable, my sister says she will get one that is the same except that it is smaller, slimmer and can record sound. I shall leave my readers to judge what kind of message I am trying to put across.  Tomorow school is going to reopen, finally a day when I can really write something that is related to school. I wonder how it will be like? Most likely chinese will be involved. I haven't passed up both my files (pure forgetfulness, not never do okay?) and I haven't done my story book review yet that was given in the june holidays actually. I shall do a quick ppt. slides on the book review today, hopefully I can snitch some marks for that.  To all those people reading this, work hard to get what you want, and you will get it. But first you must identify what you want, how to get it, and think about how much you want it, so as to motivate you to get what you want. I got my digital camera out of my savings, and though this may sound corny, go out there and fufill YOUR dreams (er, non-dirty dreams).  Pardon me for being nasty for a few seconds but according to Ervina's site, Weili = Hamtaro???? Oh dear... Better not say anything, or else get whacked by Ervina.

						   Today was rather boring. Really, try thinking about how boring a day can get. Go on, think.  Anyway, today my parents when to JB for shopping, what ever for? True, things are cheaper there but I don't really think it's worth it. Then again this rarely happens and it's their time, not mine. Speaking of which, perhaps I should have went, time today was really wasted. I should have done something.  Searched the internet for digital cameras today, I'm hoping to get something which is quite slim, yet gives good pictures and preferably holds more than 1 picture? lol, make that 30. Most importantly I'm hoping that is has a fast phototaking time, once during a school concert, while I was taking photos for ST club, I pressed the shutter button but when the camera finally "clicked" the people on stage were gone. Sheesh.. Jeanie does your camera have that problem?  Oh wait... Parents are back, I'll be back after greeting them and so on and so forth. *back* In any case, my sister is not to pleased about something my mother bought for her, because she wants to choose it herself. After boo-hooing and screaming and shouting, I found out from my mother that she bought... Bras. Well! No one is going to see them anyway, so why so fashion concscious unless they are uncomfortable? Then again, this is a girl's issue and I will desist from commenting futher for fear of insulting female readers  Momma also bought a shirt for me. I find it horrendous. Look at if yourself.  urlLink    WC (the brand) other than meaning "wild channel" can also mean "water closet" or, old-fashioned toilet bowls.  urlLink     Look and stand in horror! It's yellow! Anyway, I do not like bright colours. I only like black clothes, nothing else. Unless it's dark, then I think I will like it as well. But yellow? And I don't think I like that bullseye target thing, cupid aiming for my heart? Sorry, but it's made of stone so even if you hit accurately cupid, I can't promise you that even your steel arrows can penetrate. And what's that man with horns on the head...  Anyway according to my mother, my father chose this shirt because my surname means yellow in chinese. What kind of reasoning is that? In anycase, I'll wear that shirt, because I hate wasting money, but my mother never learns that she must never buy clothing for me... then I'm forced to wear clothing like water closets or something.  Joke of today: What does LiLin do when she had a boring day? Answer: She Doesen't Blog! Hahaha! huh? oh, right, yep people all over the world are giving me that -_-" face again.

						   (read previous entry, no. 2) Well it wasn't so bad after all, but it wasn't good. I hated the way I had to act short all the time, but at least I looked okay in the shots.  Is there a problem Li Lin? And please don't smirk, perhaps it has got something to do with today's family phototaking but beautiful people smile, the rest of them can smirk.  Hmm, it's getting into my brains now, I should get rid of it. One last quote on looks. People look their best when they don't even try. That ought to fill up philosophers appetite for today, it's food for thought.   urlLink    I took this on our way to the photograph studio. The houses look kinda nice to shoot, but I'm afraid it's not very good photograpy.  urlLink

						   This is after all only my second post, and I'm feeling the itch to blog again. For no particular reason. Strange, maybe this will wear out sooner or later and I'll probably abondon this site, like a site I made in primary school  urlLink http://www.maxpages.com./websurfie . It's completely empty so don't bother finding anything there, unless you want to take a test on how fast you can type over there...  Today there's going to be a family photo taking thing, so my family went to the early morning worship so as to come back early enough to prepare for the photo taking. I assure you this is not going to be those let-granny-take-the-picture one, it's one of those "professional studio" thing. The occasion? My father got his master degree in business, and he wants to remember this occasion. I hate having my picture taken. I hate it even more if I must smile against my will, but oh well, if it pleases my parents, whatever.  I read this comic strip "baby blues" (not today's newspaper). Anyway in it, the mother, Wanda was telling her children "From now on, you are only allowed to say, yes mom, okay mom, sure mom, of course mom, no problem mom, right away mom and that sort of thing when I ask you to set up the table." The comic strip ends with hammie telling zoe, "I still think whatever sounds better." To which zoe would reply "shh... don't let her hear that."  I learnt today that I must be generous to others, all because my mother bought tissues from a woman and her blind mother selling them at the market today.

						   Well, it is this day that this blog is made, who knows? What will be said? Perhaps it shall stay near-annonymous like cassandra? In anycase, I think shall be asking Jeanie (probably the most visited site belonging to the queen (okay okay jeanie, queen does sound old!) princess of 2H, to advertise my blog. Then we'll see what happens. Question for thinkers and dreamers: What kind of people visit blogs anyway?  Oh so sad cassandra, don't worry I'll always be there to argue with you. That way you won't fall asleep in class hehe! And yeah, in case you haven't noticed, I HAVE been talking to you you know? Albeit it may be in the form of arguing. By the way, you were saying something about an expressions voucher?...  It's my first time (blog virginity?) making a blog so maybe there will be lots of things to say. And really I have no idea how to handle this stuff. The last time I made a site was primary school and believe me when I say I was good.. At that time. Now I forgot everything there is to know, but as long as this words get published, Honestly! Who needs music and pretty icons?  I'll have to be careful with what I say... Jeanie seems to handle okay though, maybe it's because it's all "Ooooh! I got this Newee Pinky baggy! Oooh! and look, I also got this newee pinky skirt! And Look and Meeee and Hubbee!! Love him to bits!! Oooh!"  Haha, I didn't say anything about her directly, so don't put words into my mouth. Besides, Jeanie is part of my microscopic list of true friends to, so I don't think she'll mind.  Speaking of which, I know the answer but is it possible to inflict this anti-social behaviour on Cassandra so she'll literally be happy that people ARE leaving her alone? Okay I promise this will be the last time I'm talking about her; scared  kena  get whacked by her on wednesday.  To those people who are out to bring me down in the politcal race in the class of 2H, it's alright if you choose to find ways and means to search for things that I said wrongly and exploit it. I survived many of these sort of things. Oh and feel free to mock me if you find any bad English, I didn't realize that what I say have to be  scrutinized (cheem  enough?) all the time.  Right, so things end here. Meanwhile I'll be learning more about this blog machine thang and I'll just be living life. Conte Partero.
