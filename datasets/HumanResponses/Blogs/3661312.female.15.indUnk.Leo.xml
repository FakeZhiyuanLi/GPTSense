          Okay, so I didnt really have a very eventful day today. I was bored out of my mind until I decided to call Jenna. Thank God her dad didnt see her report card or she wouldnt of been able to chill. We first thought we should entertain ourselves by watching my brothers baseball game. Yes....the finals! They lost but hey it was still fun to watch. We also saw moner but she was working and decided to almost burn the concession stand down by burning pop corn, but I still love ya simmy. We also came to the conclusion that every person you date should have a small place in their heart for the "american spirt." Like hot dogs (hey, at least I think hot dogs are the american spirt). Well in my opinion hot dogs ARE and WILL continue to be the american spirt, but I seem to be the only one who agrees with that. On another note, my worst come back in my entire life happend last night. It all started with a decent looking guy who just happend to be number 6.. yes, I have a preverted mind. Never look at him and repeat these words...hey..uh...can I be number 9??       So Rosevelt Park is known for their many "parks".. well me and Jenna went on a hunt to find out just exactly how many parks Rosevelt Park really has. Your most likely wondering how many..there is about 8! We also had a shoe flinging contest, where you sit on the swings and see who can kick their flip flop furthest. Yes I won. We also met up with Sarah and Lindz and just rode our bikes around. ahhhh summer nights, how entertaining.  Good times Good times.

          Well as some of you may know, I tryed this blog thing once before. It didnt work out to well. I never wrote in it, and when I did I talked way to much about things that werent worth writing about. I also am just experimenting because I really have no clue what I'm doing. So give me a few entrys to figure it out.      On the other hand, not much has been going on. Basketball  has started up again so most of my time has been on that. I havent really chilled with any of my fiends in a long time! But we have all summer to make up for it. On a brighter note I was asked today to go to Chicago with the varsisty basketball team sometime in July!! Yeah, I'm sure most of you wouldnt think much of it but its a BIG DEAL for me here. lol.       Also... Me and Jenna were discussing this the other day. The topic of "Sex" or in other words the birds and the bees! Who came up with the pharse, the birds and the bees, like seriously think about it. Birds and bees dont fuck and if they did, that would be just wrong! So next time you hear someone use the term the birds and the bees ask them why they are referring to sex as that, because its not sex because birds and bees dont have sex!!! So does this mean that I can say the bunnys and bugs when I'm talkin about sex? Any comments?      Tom says hi...
