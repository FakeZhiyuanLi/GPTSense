						   Hi.  Yesterday one of my dogs got into the trash.  All I know for sure is that he ate a Kit-Kat and some chicken bones.  I found a wrapper and I know I'd had chicken for dinner the night before and the chicken bones were missing from the trash. I have 2 dogs and the one that got into the trash is the fatter of the 2.  He doesn't share and usually I hate this except for yesterday.  Not sharing the trash was a good thing.  His diarrhea started sometime in the late evening.  He went on the floor, I cleaned it up then we all went outside to the dog run. (By the way, this little bathroom dance went on for most of the night.)  Quick note: The dog run is a cool place in many ways.  Not only do I get to safely walk my dogs in the City at 2am on a weeknight but I get to chat with my neighbors who are all different and unique and sometimes piss me off and mosttimes don't.    Anyway, the neighbors and I chatted, when we weren't asking our dogs to please stop barking at cyclists and the weird man making kissing noises at them and at dogs on the other side of the fence.  People over 30 who don't have kids talk baby talk to their dogs.  We ask our dogs to please stop barking and say that they feel threatened and that's why they are barking and also talk with each other about how smart our dogs are.  Its a beautiful thing.    To top it all off not only did I not get enough sleep because of the diarrhea but the fire alarm went off 30 minutes before my alarm clock did.  30 minutes!!  Wasted!!  The guy that sits at the Front Desk said that its a new and improved system that's very sensitive and all the apartments are connected to it so when one alarm goes off...They all do.  Yay, me!  I am super protected against my neighbor's burning toast.    These things caused me to be very grumpy this morning.  Now the thing with me is that I have always wanted to be liked so even if I'm super grumpy I will somehow pretend to be happy. (That's very hard to do...I wouldn't recommend trying it at home.) This is changing as I get older.  I predict when I am 60 no one will like me and I will not care. Back to this morning: After dragging my ass out of the shower, dressing, and trudging down to the dog run with my dogs, I caught up with one of my neighbors.  There she stood in her work clothes, clean and wrinkled like one of those  urlLink Broom Skirts  but she was wearing Khakis and a cotton top.  So what do I care?  I, who walk around wearing dog hair like an accessory...once at work, a woman said, "Oh, you've got a gray hair." and instead of a stray gray she pulled out a white dog hair.  Once I looked in the mirror and thought I was going prematurely gray but it was dog hair (my hairdresser says my gray hair is towards the back of my head so since I don't see it I tell people I don't have gray hair.) The answer is, I don't care!  But lack of sleep did something bizarre to my brain and I said,"Wow, those pants are so wrinkled."  She should have told me to mind my own business, she didn't and everything is fine but still....how rude of me!  Now listen, I normally do rude things...but they are out of ignorance, this morning I knew it was wrong to stare and point and my neighbor's wrinkles but I still did it.  I don't know me anymore.  I'm sleepy now.  I know I've written allot of blah, blah, blah.  I will edit tomorrw.  Wait and see.  All this will be gone, swept away like a family secret.    Take care, get plenty of rest and its okay to eat Kit-Kat's in moderation.    Love, December Blue.

						   Hello!   I have sinned against the Blog.  I edited the last post.    I thought I'd tell you today about my favorite shoes this summer.  At the start of every Season I shop around for shoes and I always find the perfect pair and I wear them over and over until they fall apart around my feet.  The tragedy is not that they fall apart, its that I never realize until the end that I've been wearing the perfect shoe and I spend the entire time shopping around, feeling dissatisfied, spending money on shoes that seemed to fit ok at the store...but....  This Summer I'm stopping that midway.  Here is my favorite pair of  urlLink shoes !  They're cute, fit well and won't break the bank.  I love them and they love me.  They curve themselves around my foot, fawning over me, kissing my soles, caressing my toes.  Mmmmm...don't stop. They get along well with my clothes. They like to go on long walks with me.  They're a little piece of eye candy and people compliment me on them.  Also, they're cool. I think  urlLink Trolley Girl  would wear them.  Except I found them first.    They are called Julia and I love them.    That's all for now, December Blue

						   By the way, what do you think of this  urlLink article?   Anyone...anyone.  Buhler?  What do I think?    But it sound like its a "Passion of the Christ" movie.  You know, the Bible according to Michael Moore.  What I wonder about is why is it all over the place like a Harrison Ford movie?

						   Hello!  How are you?  Hope all is well and that you're having a good, fulfilling weekend.  How am I?  I'm doing fine.  I'm alive, I'm healthy, I have enough money in the bank to go to Burger King whenever I want.  That was one of my wishes when I was growing up.  Another wish was that I could shrink myself into a little tiny person and sneak into  urlLink Woolworth's  and play with the toys, even bring the toys home.  My Catholic Girl side would also wish for tiny money that I could leave by the cash register and that would then grow into real money once I was gone so that no one would miss the toys.  Back then the  urlLink Woolworth's  in our neighborhood had a  urlLink lunch counter .  I remember it as I write this post.  Later on I worked at Woolworth's as a teenager. The  urlLink counter  was gone by that time.  I think we sold hotdogs and pretzels from a corner of the store.  I worked in the pet department.  Once three finches escaped their cages and the manager and security guard used little fish nets to catch them.  The fish supplier used to overfill our tanks sometimes and the little fish (I don't remember what kind) were so close to the edge that they'd jump out of their tanks and you'd find them flopping around on the tile floor or sometimes, tragically, spread across it like cream cheese on a bagel, victims of someone's shoe...most times - mine.  Then there was the hamster story.  Do you have time?  I used to have Monday's off from the pet department and one weekend I didn't come in on a Saturday either...maybe the store was closed.  In any case no one thought to feed the hamsters...not the manager, the stock guy, not even the lady that worked housewares right next to the pet dept.  So, when I came in on Tuesday, where there once were 5 hamsters, now there was 1.  One big, fat hamster.  And I thought, oh, they sold all the hamsters!  And then when I went in to fill his water and food dish I saw his horrible, little secret.  Big hamster had eaten the 4 others and all that remained were bones and some fur.  Yuck!  I was afraid to sell Big Hamster...you know, now that he was a canibal. Anyway, this story goes on for a little while longer but I'll end it by telling you that a little boy bought the hamster and later on came back to the store for hamster food and I asked him how his hamsters were getting along and he said everything was fine.  I don't know...once a canibal, always a canibal...that's how I feel. But, who knows...maybe with a little love and allot of food the hamster learned to live with other hamsters and not eat them during hard times.    Before I go...I wanted to tell you that I made curtains for my stepfather's bedroom window.  My mom put them up and she says they look great and really cheer up the place.  With my sewing machine I've made some horrible things that I sometimes secretly wear in the privacy of my own home because they are the Frankenstein Monsters of the fashion world.  But, I must say, I'm getting really good at the whole curtain making thing.  Yay, me!!    The morale of the story is: If you sew allot of crap eventually you will get good at making curtains.    Yeah, Baby!!  Have a lovely, relaxing Sunday!  Don't forget to plan out your wardrobe for tomorrow so you don't have to run around at the last minute looking for clean underwear.  Yours truly, December Blue

						   I have the day off today.  So far I've sat in front of my computer for most of the day reading other people's blogs, looking up post-positive realism, reading about Access Hollywood gossip, and eating strawberries.    I ordered a shedding blade for my dogs.  There's hair everywhere.  Its not just a light covering over the floor its clumps in the corners and inches thick behind the doors where I never look and I get rid of some but there's still more.    This entry is not so smart. (And has been edited after the posting...its better this way, honest.)  I'm going to go shower now and go to Wal-Mart and go visit Mom and come home and work on making a skirt or some other sewing project and I'll tell you about it tomorrow.    Take care and Love always, December Blue

						   I considered editing my last post but then I decided no one's reading this except for me and anyway I can always edit it tomorrow.  There's still time.  Mmmmm...I've had sex on the brain all day today.  No one is safe!  Not even "J" at work who seems like he's a little gay but has an ex-wife.  Okay...so what do I mean seems a little gay.  He's more graceful than I am.  (Maybe I'm secretly jealous.)  He talks with his hands allot, waving them around like airy little handkerchiefs.     Good News  Eventually, you will really have a good relationship with your mom as long as you just accept her, you're over 30 (because it takes time), and she never put out her cigarettes on your back or dated your boyfriends.    This Saturday I bought my mom a nice handbag for Father's Day and one for myself just because.  Then my mom asked me about that pair of pants she'd given me to stitch up on my fancy shmantzy sewing machine.    So, on Sunday night I started working on them thinking that I'd do it right before bed but, my God, there were holes and tears all along the seams and each time I thought I was done I noticed another rip.  And finally around 1am I called Mom up and told her that there was no hope.  I didn't know if these were her favorite pair of pants or what...but they're not gonna make it mom!  I tried and I tried but there are too many holes!!  The fabric is weak!  And I was stressing about about the pants and shoulder pain and running out of bobbin thread and she says, "throw them out".  What?!!   I keep forgetting to always watch what I say at work and to not say everything that I think and to be calm and its hard to say the right thing all the time.  I'm having a "why did I say that?" moment.  Was it the crack talking?    Good night.    December Blue

						   More about "M".  I don't want you to get the wrong impression about "M" and her "Plumpies". She's a born again Christian and maybe that has something to do with her calling a woman's chest area..."plumpies".  Repressed, suppressed, compressed, depressed..breasts.  Enough! "M" is good!  On an new and improved note...my boss is trying to be friendly with me and it feels so awkward but I try and I laugh politely at her jokes but in my head I'm just hoping she'll stop talking to me and let me get back to work and all of this because I don't trust her and her secretary "D" is leaving but she's called me up to tell me not to trust the boss. I'll miss "D", she was always very negative and manipulative but in an obvious way.  So you knew you where you stood and how to react but with the boss there's many layers of gunk to get through so you don't see the sore until you get passed the scab and the oozing puss caused by the infection.  Ewwwww...   Wouldn't it be nice if you could just go to work to work and once you were done you didn't have to stay around and pretend to work until 5pm?  Wouldn't it be nice to not have to wear pantyhose to work on 90 degree days with high humidity?  When all the other women are waiting for the trolley in their cute summer dresses with bare legs and open toed sandals there I stand in my pantyhose with my closed up shoes and sweat between my legs so that when I get off at my stop there's a wet stain on my seat. Uggghhhh....  Update on the Trolley Girl Didn't like what she was wearing today.  Won't copy that.  Just a plain skirt and black shirt.    Its too hot to think.  My neighbor invited me to a barbecue tomorrow, lets call the neighbor "M&M" to differentiate her from "M".  By the way, I should write here, so you'll know, "M&M" is more than a neighbor and slightly less than a lover.  Ahhhh, the plot twists!  It hurts my brain to think about writing about that little story so I'll hold off...maybe tomorrow it will be cooler.    Until then, take care, stay cool, and drink plenty of liquids.

						   My life has been an interesting collection of snapshots over the past few days.    The librarian talking to my shoulder telling me I owe a $6 late fee (what kind of communication technique is that anyway?  Do people really think you won't notice them talking to your shoulder or earlobe while you're looking into their eyes??)   The homeless guy sitting outside my office building asking for money who I gave a quarter to and then later on that same day, another homeless guy wearing a pretty baby blue golf shirt who came by, while I was sitting in the oasis eating lunch, to tell me he was a diabetic (he said this pointing to his inner arm) and needed money for food and I refused and he said God Bless You, and I didn't feel bad about saying, "no" and I felt even less bad after the God Bless You part.   The woman that rides the trolley with me most mornings (by the way, she doesn't really know me and I always sit 2 rows behind her or wherever there's a seat...but we've ridden the trolley together for over 1 year so she's joined the circle of people that I kind of know and expect to be around...I guess I'm sorta like those people who watch soap operas and feel they "know" the characters..except I feel like I know the players in my trolley scene in a very non stalker like way (I swear) and sometimes I'll see them outside of the normal scene and I'll start up a conversation and they'll be like "who the hell are you?" and I'll be like, "Hey, what are you doing here?!  You're a long way from the trolley!!") Anyway, I love the way this girl dresses!  And on Tuesday she was wearing this cute purple skirt with a black knit top and flats and I copied her style!!  Yes!! I did that (in a non-stalker like way).  I thought about not doing it but then I thought that I really like that skirt and I think I would feel really comfortable wearing the same color combo as she was so I got a skirt like hers and I wore the outfit to work and guess what?!  I felt really comfortable.  Hmmm...I wonder what she'll wear tomorrow.  urlLink SWF .  The birthday cake at work with the blue icing and me coming in after everyone had gone back to their desks and running my finger along the corner of the cardboard cake plate thing for more blue icing.  A close up of my slightly wet blue finger after licking off the icing.  (When was the last time I ate cake and didn't feel guilty about it?  6 or 7?    Just now, trying on a see through lace top I got on sale at Daffy's and really liking the way my breasts looked in it.  The extra weight makes them full but not too big.  Isn't breasts a funny word?  Its not cool.  I could say tits but I don't like that word. (Catholic School Girl) How about the neutral chest?  My friend M calls hers "Pumpies". That's a lot bizarre but so am I so what do I care?  If I stare at your earlobe long enough, I can hypnotize it into doing whatever I want!    Until tomorrow, December

						   Hello, and thank you for stopping by.  I haven't had a chance to clean up the place yet, I apologize.  Please have a seat, just push those papers aside and watch out for the dogs...they shed soooo much!    I'm starting an online journal because I hope writing down the stuff in my head will help sort it out.   Is this entry awful for you to read? Sorry. If you leave, please don't slam the door on your way out.     The Good  1.  I spent time with mom today.  She looks great.  She got a haircut that really, really looks good on her and she was wearing a cute outfit.    2.  I started this journal! Leaving so soon?  Don't go...I baked cookies!     The Bad  1.  I had horrible, horrible  urlLink cramps  today. I wanted to throw myself on the ground at Wal-Mart holding my belly and crying so that they would call an ambulance or something (airlift me outta there, maybe?) and I could just come home and lay down and watch the whole thing on the 11 o'clock news.    I'll write again tomorrow. Maybe I'll tell you a funny story....     Take care, December Blue

						   Hi. So yesterday was a bad evening because of my brother. Today a woman who I've worked with for the past year left the Firm I work for. It was too sad.  I don't connect with allot of people and as evil and bitchy and manipulative as she tended to be she still had something about her that was great and she liked me and I liked her. I loved her vicious ways and I'll miss her blow by blow accounts of our bosses failures and co-workers shortcomings. Its just that I know that deep down inside she's a sensitive woman and she truly didn't mean any of the trash talking (okay, she probably meant a lot of it, but still I believe most of the anger was an exaggeration), she did it to hide her soft marshmallow center.  So, I was sad all of today. Also, she and I are obsessed over romance novels. That was our main link to each other. We bonded over Christine Feehan and Pamela Morsi. We'd critique romance novels like we worked for the New York Times and were discussing Angela's Ashes or works of Shakespeare.  She usually wears way too much eyeshadow in shades of violet and green and black and her red dress and red high heeled stripper pumps clash with her big red hair. Can you believe I don't remember what she wore today. I think something blue.  Maybe in her honor on Monday, I will wear dark grey eyeshadow from my eyelid to my eyebrow. I'll let you know if I do something like that. But I will do something in her honor...yes indeed...maybe I will wear stripper shoes and walk around the office real slow like she did...swaying my hips and every so often I'll stop and give someone a nice, sensual, "fuck you" look.  Rock on, baby! No one can touch you. You leave a room and everyone remembers where you stood and what you said and they hate you for it and you don't care because you're shoes lift you up above it all. You come back and you walk all over them with your mouth. Yeah!!  You are the greatest and you taught me allot and yes, I will honor you on Monday.  Well, take care dear web surfer dude. Are you really out there? Don't answer that. I don't know what I would say if people started commenting on my entries. It would be a shock and I swear I would topple down from the stripper shoes I plan on wearing to work on Monday.  Remember:Black eyeshadow can be intimidating so enjoy wearing it and yes, I think its okay to revel in your power as long as you don't do it everyday.  All things in moderation.   December Blue.

						   Tonight I cried from deep down inside of me because I thought something bad was going to happen to my brother.&nbsp; If anything bad ever happened to him my heart would break.&nbsp; And I know I could put it back together, but it would always be cracked and you'd be able to see globs of hard glue on the sides.  At first I wasn't going to cry over the phone but then I did.&nbsp; My mom was on the other end and she had finished telling me the bad news and all that and then before we hung up, right before, I had my mini-breakdown.&nbsp;   Well, I'm better now.&nbsp; I don't care too much for reading people's journals who talk about their life's tragedies and I'm sure you will find that to be too much.&nbsp; I'd rather tell you about all the cool parties I was going to...but that's not me on most nights and especially not tonight.&nbsp; But, I'll keep the tragedies down to a very small minority, I promise.&nbsp;   Take care, December Blue

						   Last night was interesting.&nbsp; I went out with other dog owners who live in the building....it was allot of talking and people smoking and I can't say I had a good time.&nbsp; It was just a night out.&nbsp; I like to listen to music and get up and dance and I spent the evening feeling slightly stressed.&nbsp;   The two guys on either side of me talked politics.&nbsp; Did you know that Capitalism leads to Communism?&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp; But that's what they said.&nbsp; Just from looking at recent history I would say Communism leads back to Capitalism.&nbsp; Hmmmm....whatever.&nbsp; I was afraid to say that because I always think they (meaning guys like the ones who were talking at the party....guys who quote Marx and Lenin and say they were part of socialist parties and would go around beating up neo-nazis...an eye for an eye) will come back with a bunch of names and dates and, secretly I think they are full of shit, but unfortunately I have no names and dates of world leaders traipsing around in my head and so I will sound like an idiot and then they will know I did not finish college (although I  sometimes  fully intend to go back) and then they will laugh at me and point and stare and not invite me to anymore outings because they will say I am not smart.&nbsp;   There was also talk about the Electoral College.  This morning I read up on some things I'm sure I learned about in highschool and gradeschool (honest, I did) but I just didn't remember so here are some links that I found interesting.&nbsp; If you'd like to suggest some more links to expand my learning, please feel free.&nbsp; I promise I will look at the site.&nbsp; I'm working on the whole Capitalism leads to Communism issue....I'll get back to you on that.&nbsp;   Here are some links if you're interested:   urlLink  How the Electoral College Works  &nbsp; - just the facts.    urlLink  The Way We Elect Our Presidents  &nbsp; - watch out for this one.&nbsp; Read it with a grain of salt.&nbsp; Some good insight and allot of anti-Gore.    urlLink  The Popular Vote Doesn't Count   - more insight.&nbsp; The Election is like a football game.&nbsp; Read the link.    &nbsp;   urlLink  A Popular Vote    - Love this History House article.    My Conclusion: So far I am for keeping The Electoral College for the following reasons:   1) It has worked for us over all these years.&nbsp; Our country is strong and whole.&nbsp; Sure Gore didn't make it to President even though he got the Popular Vote but that's happened in the past too.&nbsp; Its the way this particular system works.&nbsp; Anyway, its not like Gore won the popular vote by an overwhelming margin.&nbsp; It was something like 300 votes in Florida....(somebody check my numbers).&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; A huge amount of people voted for Bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we stand behind the office until we get somebody else in there.&nbsp;   2)The Electoral wins aren't usually as close as the popular vote wins.&nbsp; So more people buy into one party.&nbsp; More united support&nbsp;behind the new president/vice president/leadership.   That's all for now.&nbsp;  Take care,  December Blue

						   Fear of popularity.&nbsp; I have some very cool neighbors who've asked me to join them at a local bar that serves up giant margaritas for a friend's birthday.&nbsp; Its very nice to be included.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting so much better with age.&nbsp; No one invited me to anything when I was a teenager.&nbsp;   Did I tell you that I'm having an "I am cute, and no one can touch this" week.&nbsp; Yeah baby!&nbsp; I'm hottt and men can't&nbsp;take their&nbsp;eyes off of me.&nbsp; Sometimes they look at me and pass out with lust.&nbsp; Poor men.&nbsp; Put your heads between your&nbsp;knees...it'll&nbsp;help.&nbsp; &nbsp;   I feel very sexy.&nbsp; Yesterday I walked around in my low cut top purring at the pretty gentleman walking by in their suits and clean cuts.&nbsp; I think I'm too sexy for this entry.&nbsp; Too bad.  See ya later. December Blue

						   Hi!  I have to get to bed in 0 to 10 minutes because I got almost no sleep last night and now I'm all worried that tomorrow I'm not going to be able to think straight because of lack of sleep and I'll make life threatening mistakes like accidentally stepping in front of a moving trolley or losing my coordination while running around my desk at work with a pair of really sharp scissors.&nbsp; Also, I'll look really tired and old and wrinkled because of lack of sleep.&nbsp; Damn you Dateline for adding this anxiety to my list...by the way next on the list is fear that I'm not getting enough Calcium and that I will soon develop Osteoporosis...fear of drinking from aluminum cans leading to Alzheimers, fear of the fungus that lived with us in the back bedroom of the house I grew up in and that that fungus has somehow fatally damaged me only I won't see the effects until 5 or so years from now, fear that I am too fat and fear of excess facial hair.&nbsp; There are others of course but that's enough for now.&nbsp; I don't want to scare you away too soon.&nbsp;   I went to a bizarre communications training today.&nbsp; I'll tell you about it tomorrow or later when I've got all my thoughts together about it and when I have more time and don't have to be asleep right away.&nbsp;   I wanted to tell you that last night I did something that totally shows my amazing growth as a powerful woman.&nbsp; Uhmmm...no not that...whatever you are thinking it can't be that. I just know.&nbsp;Its actually very big for me though.&nbsp; My neighbor was playing his music really, really loud again and my couch was actually vibrating along with his Stevie Wonder CD.&nbsp; Rock On little couch.&nbsp; But I was not in the mood. It was 9:30pm and I need to relax so, where in the past I would have gone down to the front desk to complain or even suffered through the noise...The new and improved me (in the colorful new resealable package) walked over to dear neighbor's Soul Train revival and pounded on the door several times.&nbsp; Yay, me!&nbsp; Of course, he never heard me but still I know I made the attempt.&nbsp; I ended up calling the front desk and asking her to call my neighbor and let him know the noise level was about to make my ears bleed.&nbsp; I asked her to let him know that it was me making the complaint.&nbsp; ME!&nbsp;   See ME be proud of being foolishly brave.&nbsp; See ME attack new neighbor with MOTOWN CD collection in frustrated anger over earsplitting decibels.&nbsp; Run ME, Run!&nbsp;   Dear neighbor turned down his music.&nbsp; I could still feel the beat outside my apartment but behind closed doors the sound was faint.&nbsp;   Well, there you have a little wonderful story about me.&nbsp; Read it in good health.&nbsp;   Take care always,  December Blue.

						   On Friday night two folks I know from the dog run came pounding on my door....asking me to join their party.&nbsp; Very cool.&nbsp; So I went .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It was a little bit of a bitching session at one point which I didn't participate in.&nbsp; I don't like trashing the people that work the front desk of our building.&nbsp; I mean I like to vent just like the next person...it feels oh so good to gripe about how Ed didn't buzz me in when I know he saw me juggling 5 grocery bags..but then I remember how Ed came up to my apartment when I was scared because I found the door open and he looked all around with me and we decided I hadn't shut the door all the way like I thought.&nbsp; I don't think it was wise to trash Ed at the party.&nbsp; There were a couple of folks there who I know are gossips and are friends with folks manning the front desk and I hope that the one guy, Ed, they were talking about at the party won't get fired.&nbsp; They accused him of stealing money from one of the girl's wallets.&nbsp; Apparently she dropped it, one of the other girls at the party found it and turned it in to Ed and Ed gave it back to its original owner.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when she got her wallet back, according to her, it was minus $40.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  She doesn't have proof that Ed took it.&nbsp; It could have been anybody, even the other dogowner.&nbsp; And, anyway, once you've dropped your wallet in the lobby....you're lucky just to get it back...we live in the heart of the City.&nbsp; A few months ago somebody shot out the windows at the corner BlockBuster.&nbsp; This isn't Idaho or Nebraska or wherever there's a place that crime does not exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Just like the guy on the 12th floor who left his helmet and bike&nbsp;airpump and some sort of bike computer thingy out in the hallway and is all pissed off because somebody stole them so he put up a really nasty&nbsp;note in the elevator saying, "If you're the thief that stole my stuff&nbsp;take it to the front desk."&nbsp; I read that and thought he was an idiot...why would you leave&nbsp;stuff you don't want stolen out in the hallway??&nbsp; Its not 1950....we lock our apartment doors and&nbsp;we don't walk out by ourselves late at night&nbsp;for a reason.&nbsp; Yes, it would be nice to&nbsp;be able to get up in the middle of the night and go for a walk if you wanted to without worrying about being mugged or raped...(I don't think I'd ever want to but if that's what people want to do then, whatever floats your boat.) &nbsp;But we live in the City.&nbsp; Its not a horrible place...it just has a strong flavor.&nbsp; It doesn't go down smooth and easy.&nbsp; Its dry and wet and crunchy and sucks up the moisture in your mouth and you need to wash it down with a tall, cold bottle of Lysol.&nbsp; But I like it.&nbsp; I like the mix of people and economic backgrounds and artists mixed in with drug dealers and housewives with car alarms that go off in the middle of the night and fire engines and police helicopters and freedom of many religions and Mormons who come to the City to save the poor and homeless guys who ask you for $3 and the bus that's never, ever on time and I could do without the crime and the scary feeling when I walk home late at night but its part of the package.&nbsp; It wouldn't be the City without it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, please don't expect to live in the City and not have your $40 stolen.&nbsp; Its too bad but it happens.&nbsp; Its not right and you should be pissed off but don't blame someone who you're not sure did it. Just suck it up and next time be aware of where you put your stuff!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On to Saturday, please.&nbsp; By the way, before I started writing I forgot to say, "hello".&nbsp; Sorry about that.&nbsp; The whole Ed thing has me a little upset.&nbsp; Saturday here was okay.&nbsp; I didn't do too much again.&nbsp; I'm still on a hunt for&nbsp;a cheap bike.&nbsp; I took the bus all the way to Wal-Mart and was going to get fabric but they didn't have enough yards of the kind I wanted and the bikes seemed too expensive for how cheap they were and so I ended up just getting $10 worth of dog treats and a Lime Diet Coke.&nbsp; Mmmm..yummy.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I caught up with my neighbor who I have a crush on and we went to the local deli together because she wanted all kinds of Cider and then we decided to have a barbecue together so we went to the ghettomart (soon I'll tell you why we call the supermarket the ghettomart..but I think whatever you are imagining is the reason right now is probably on target)&nbsp; and we bought hamburger meat and all the things that go with it to have our impromptu barbecue.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It took almost 2 hours to finally eat because the charcoal wouldn't light and the man at the next picnic table came over to help but kept insisting on his way of doing everything which put me in a very ungrateful mood for a good 15 minutes until the little barbecue grill he was putting together for us started to look like a grill.&nbsp; Then I managed to say thank you very much and mean it.&nbsp; My neighbor and I talked til about 12am.&nbsp; It was nice to be out there and talking with someone.&nbsp; I'm glad we did it.  &nbsp;  Should have done laundry today but didn't do it.&nbsp; Also my&nbsp; little dog has a little "hot spot" on his side.&nbsp; If it gets any worse I'll take him to the vet.&nbsp; I felt very guilty when I thought it was my fault...that I'd gone overboard with the shedding blade.&nbsp; But my neighbor said it was probably a "hot spot".&nbsp; I'll keep you posted on how he's doing.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, now I'll go down and walk them and grab some water for myself before going down.&nbsp; I'm feeling sleepy early today.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Take care,  December Blue.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   Hmmm...the Blog Fairy God Parent added all sorts of fun editing tools to my posting page so now I  can do this  .&nbsp;   Mmmmmmmm....mmmmm...mmmmmm .&nbsp; Was it good  for  you?  &nbsp;  This week it rained allot here in the city.&nbsp; My favorite canvas shoes got all messed up!!!&nbsp; I was jumping in and out of puddles and the water was up to my ankles when I got off the trolley because the drains weren't draining.&nbsp; Yuck!&nbsp; Dirty tunnel water.&nbsp; (Here in Philly the trolley goes underground for a while just like the subway only its much, much slower and you have to remember to step down to the first step to get out or the trolley door won't open and no matter how much you shout, "Back Door...Back Door!!!!!", the trolley driver won't stop again until the next station.)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On Wednesday it rained hard again and the rivers of water heading towards the clogged drains were two wide to jump so after I got off the bus (Trolley to work and Bus to home) I walked in the street for a little while, until the guy driving the car&nbsp;behind me&nbsp;got pissed off and started beeping his horn..."fuck you", I said quietly because here in Philly they carry handguns...and I took off my shoes and went barefoot the rest of the way home.&nbsp; The water actually felt good and it was like being a kid again in the summer when it got too hot to sleep and the block captain would open up the fire hydrant to cool us down and sometimes she'd open it up all the way and the water would come gushing down past our house and I'd grab a plastic container and throw water down my shirt and on the front of my house and the bricks would hiss a thank you at me for cooling them down.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I hate answering the phone at work.&nbsp; They make us fill in for the receptionist when she's out and I get all flustered putting people into voicemail and transferring calls.&nbsp; I just don't want to make a mistake but then I do and I'm all like, "Oh, did we get disconnected?&nbsp; My apologies...our phone system is behaving oddly today."&nbsp; Hmmmm....not my fault buddy.&nbsp; I come up to answer these phones once in a blue moon...I need constant repetition to remember how to transfer you into voice mail.&nbsp; I have to write everything down so I'll remember even the littlest things.&nbsp; And you want me to put you into voicemail right away...well kiss my ass and wait for me til I'm good and ready and then kiss it again just because I want you to beg ass hole!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  If I said that to anybody I would get fired.&nbsp; Right away...with a quickness.  &nbsp;  Want to know a secret I have only told 2 people??&nbsp; Its not a bad secret but its a secret that I'm holding close to me just in case it can't happen.&nbsp; I'm trying to buy a house.&nbsp; Me!&nbsp; No one in my immediate family has ever been a homeowner....my mom and my brother and I were sort of squatters when we were growing up and I was always scared the owner would show up and kick us out.&nbsp; If I got a house I can't tell you how incredible that would be.&nbsp; A place where I could feel safe and not be afraid someone would kick me out because there's too much dog hair or because the dog peed on the floor on the same spot over and over again and I accidentally rubbed off the color of the wood with Comet.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This week was a wash...not because of the rain but because all I did when I got home was read.&nbsp; I liked reading but all the time I was reading I kept thinking I should be doing some of the stuff on my list.  &nbsp;  I hate the list.&nbsp; The list is the monkey on my back.&nbsp; Get off my back, man!!&nbsp; Fuck off.  &nbsp;  Hooters.  &nbsp;  Instead of breasts.&nbsp; "Oh yeah baby.....mmmmm, baby that it hold 'em like that put them in your mouth....lick my hooters."&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I think I will take the comments away from this page or maybe comment myself.&nbsp; That comments section is lonely.&nbsp; I will call myself anonymous or maybe Jane or Jim.&nbsp; Yes, Jim!&nbsp; I will call myself after that dick at work who puts his wife on speaker phone when she's all upset so that everyone hears her and thinks she's a whiner.&nbsp; Yes, I will be Jim and I will make condescending comments like, "December Blue, what a unique name...I enjoyed reading your entry today...but, you used the word condescending incorrectly."&nbsp;&nbsp; Dick.&nbsp; Too bad.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm getting sleepy.&nbsp; Must walk the dogs before getting in bed.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I looked cute today.&nbsp; I wore my company golf shirt to show team spirit and my checkered&nbsp;"A" line skirt that showed the top of my thighs when the&nbsp;wind blew it up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Goodnight.&nbsp; Do you sleep with the light on?&nbsp; I've got a little night light and I set the tv on&nbsp;to go off in&nbsp;30 minutes so I can pretend there's someone in the living room&nbsp;right as I&nbsp;fall asleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Sleep tight,  December Blue.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   Hi...its after midnight and I need to get to bed but I wanted to tell you about my bug story...I knew you'd want to hear about it right away...ahem...anyway..  I found one of those huge flying roaches in my sink climbing my dirty dishes like a champ.  Historically, bugs have made me freeze in a deer in the headlights kind of way. Not this time, baby!!  I grabbed the RAID and attacked!!  While I sprayed it to death I repeated in a joyful tone, "Yeah, fuck you bug...yeah!  Take that!!"  It was very satisfying and afterwards I felt like wringing my hands and laughing over the sink in a very mad scientist kind of way.  Weird, huh?  But still, I defeated the roach!! I am Queen!    Do I intimidate you roaches?  Are you scared of me and my full aersole can of raid?  Let that be a lesson to you and all other pests....crawl around in my kitchen at your own risk.    Mwaha, mwahaha...mwahahahahahahha..hahahah.ahahhahhahahahahhaah!!!  Good Night, Sleep Tight, don't let the bed bugs touch your dishes...that's just nasty!!  Love, December Blue

						   My mom came over yesterday with my 5 year old niece.  My niece is getting very cool.  For a while there I was worried she'd turn into one of those annoying snobby little kids but she's turned that ugly corner and now she's down to earth and caring and will share her candybar with you if you ask her nicely.  Also, I love it that she stands up for herself but I hate it that she's too serious. She sensors herself.  We went by this thrift shop with toys outside and she got excited over one of those little rocking horse type things and she got on it and I could see she was having fun but she quit after just a few seconds of rocking.  I've seen people have to drag their kids kicking and screaming from toys like that but not my niece.    This worries me.  I was a serious kid like that.  Never having any fun and its hard to break out of that when you're an adult.  Maybe its because my niece is the oldest...maybe its because my sister in-law depends on her to take care of her sister, maybe its just her nature.      Hey, today I saw someone I normally see on the trolley.   urlLink That  happens to me allot.  I refrained from waving and saying hello and asking her if she often shopped at Anne Taylor because we've never had a conversation and betcha she might find my behavior just a little bizarre.    I went to brunch and shopping with my neighbor.  The makeup lady at Douglas said to wear  urlLink lipgloss  in the summer.  She said that with my tan something light looks better than the plum lipstick my neighbor was recommending.  This lipgloss is okay...but don't believe the hype...it doesn't last.  Still its not sticky, just shiny so I'm satisfied.   Don't worry dear reader, I have plans on going back to school soon and getting more activities under my belt so I will have more to tell you about than lipgloss.   I've been thinking about jogging in the mornings.    I love chocolate graham crackers.  My oldest dog loves chocolate graham cracker crumbs.  He's down there right now licking them up off the floor, his doggy hair tickles my ankles.    I've been thinking more and more about getting a bike and going bike riding again.  About running and eventually doing a mini-marathon (for starters).  What do you think about that?    My mom freaked me out yesterday after she got home (from visiting with me). Something she said.  After I got off the phone with her I thought I was okay but I couldn't breathe so well.  Anxiety attack.  Sometimes that happens after talks with mom.  I wasn't tuned in to it before and now I notice when its happening.  Not a good feeling.  I went on the internet to calm down.  Read other people's journals.    I wonder if my diary/journal/blog will ever do that for anybody?   urlLink Here  is a link to one of my favorites.  Something about her journal makes me keep going back for more...and calms me down after bizarre interactions with family members.    Well...its Sunday again and I should do any of the following things: 1.  Change the lightbulb in the kitchen...its dark in there and the bugs are happy. 2.  Do the laundry 3.  Work on the top that I want to embroider because right now it looks like a pajama top 4.  Read my book - The Custom of the Country by Edith Wharton.  I have a new neighbor who moved in with his two dogs one of whom is named Undine.  He lent me Custom of the Country and also lent it to another neighbor so we're both reading it.  Its his favorite book.  Undine is the main character. 5.  Take the dogs out to pee before it starts to rain. 6.  Call mom and find out how her day went and if she got my niece home okay. 7.  Send a note to my cousin telling her I forgive her for what happened about 4 months ago that led us to not speak to each other during that whole time and she sent me a very nice card that took allot of guts to write.   8.  Wrap a gift I bought for one of my co-workers whose daughter just had her first baby.  Wow, that's a long list of stuff!  Too bad there's nothing good on TV or I could avoid doing everything.    Take care and have a great week!  I'll try to write tomorrow and let you know how many things on my list I was able to get to.  Goodbye for now.  Love, December Blue.    P.S.  My little dog is stalking me.  He watches my every move.  When I get up he gets up, when I take a shower he sits by the toilet and looks at me and after he's found a really comfortable spot on the sofa and is in a deep sleep, if I get up for water or something, I've seen him open one eye and follow me around with just his eyeball.  My little dog is also lazy.

						   Mmmm...mmmm...mmmm...I love me some good birthday cake.  Yummy icing pink or blue and moist yellow cake.  When I was little my mom would get birthday cakes with a nice pineapple layer to keep everything moist.  It was a happy suprise.    Its nobody's birthday anytime soon and restaurants don't sell birthday cakes by the slice, do they?  I wish they did.  I'd buy the slice with some of the flower edging and part of the letter "B".    This weekend I went to a friend's wedding reception.  The couple eloped and had a party to celebrate their marriage.  It was a cool party.  Open bar...very light refreshments.  For dinner I had a little of the macaroni (not allot because it tasted like Miracle Whip....ewwww)and a diet coke, a cosmopolitan, a margarita, an apple martini, a chocolate martini, a fuzzy navel...that was enough.  I got on the dance floor and started doing my Solid Gold Dancer routine.  Then I danced with this guy who kept saying things like, "Go baby, yeah baby...don't stop".  It was like being in a bad porn movie.  Meanwhile, I went with a neighbor and her brother and her brother kept touching me and touching my left breast (did I tell you I really don't think the word breast is cool.  I did in an earlier post.  Its not sexy.  Oh, yeah touch me, touch me there, right there...oh yeah, mmmmmm...now suck it..suck it...suck my  breast  baby.  See?  Not sexy.)    Afterwards we went to a local diner, had breakfast and then took a taxi home.  The next morning I woke up and oh, well...it could have been worse.  That's what I kept telling myself.    Are you reading this and thinking you've done allot worse?  Hmmmmm?  See, I hate losing control. I don't do it easily.  Since it doesn't happen allot, when it does I'm all like, "why the fuck did I do that?"  And in other news...I am under the weight of the I need to go back to school, I hate my apartment, I wish I could come home and feel like it was home and then I don't change it because I only know how to survive, I don't know how to live feeling.  Do you know what I mean?  Growing up life was so miserable...we were very poor and how the house looked and being comfortable was not important.  We worried about food and shoes and having heat in the winter.  And we all shared a bed and it was just surviving and not living.  I rarely felt safe there and that's the feeling I know...the not feeling safe feeling the slightly tense waiting for whatever is going to happen feeling.    I'm working on that.  Its hard.    I said allot today.  Tomorrow I will probably delete it but today its here.    Well, I'd better go get the laundry.    Take care,  December Blue  I'd like to buy the world some cake and keep it company.

						   I recently  urlLink posted  an article re:Farenheit 911.    The author made references to people/topics I'd never heard of...and so because I didn't know it I looked it up and here it is...just in case you're like me and didn't know it either:  Who was:  urlLink Sergei Eisenstein    urlLink Leni Riefenshahl     urlLink MoveOn.org   - this is a link to their site.   Definition of  Demagogue  -  1.  A leader who obtains power by means of impassioned appeals to the emotions and prejudices of the populace.  2.  A leader of the common people in ancient times.   An Article on  urlLink David Kay  by Fred Kaplan.  Who was  urlLink Leon Klinghoffer   The definition of  Totalitarian  -  Of, relating to, being, or imposing a form of government in which the political authority exercises absolute and centralized control over all aspects of life, the individual is subordinated to the state, and opposing political and cultural expression is suppressed: “A totalitarian regime crushes all autonomous institutions in its drive to seize the human soul” (Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.).   The definition of a  Republic  -   1 : a government having a chief of state who is not a monarch and who in modern times is usually a president; also : a political unit (as a nation) having such a form of government 2 : a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law; also : a political unit (as a nation) having such a form of government   That helped me...you?   Happy 4th of July!!!   December Blue

						   Hi! I'm all mixed up today. Feelings of I want to and I don't want to but I really want to are using WMD against each other inside of me. There's no spider hole for me.  On a better note...my niece is in town!! But you know that. (Must have a child of my own. Have geysers of loving feelings shooting out of my pores. No one is safe.) I can't stop looking at my niece, writing down things she says while we wait for my bus, she tells me I can use her markers to draw a picture of my dogs but that sorry the red marker is broken because she bit the end off. She wants a cup of coffee at 7pm and my mom put a tiny bit of watered down coffee in a huge cup full of milk with extra sugar. She drinks all of it down and asks me what's at the bottom of the cup and I look and say I think its sugar and she says, "I love sugar." and sticks her fingers in to get the last drops.  I wish I could protect her from magazine ads and Mary Kate and Ashley and their skinny bodies and bullies and pain.  Well, I'm running off now. Take a shower, walk the dogs, run to Rite Aid and buy a toy or something, take the train to mom's house and spend time with a world wonder and my lovely mom and then back here to rent movies with my neighbor and watch them at her place and (more confusion, WMD feelings) then walk the dogs, chat with dog owners, come back here and maybe write to you again or read my favorite online journals (just 2 because I'm a creature of habit).  Have a good day today! As my neighbor says when her big dog that allot of people are afraid of has another dog pinned down to the ground and is baring its teeth in a most scary way..."Don't do too much!"  Don't do too much!!  Take care, December Blue

						   Hi. Once again its late and I'm really sleepy but I wanted to write before bed...so here I am. There will be spelling and grammatical errors. But, wait don't leave. I promise to run the spell check this time so it won't be so bad..really...st aaayy .  My mood yesterday was sad with tones of depression and tawny highlights. Why? Because I applied over the phone for a loan and finally realized that you have to be almost perfect to get an FHA loan. I may still fax in my paperwork but the loan guy said I could be a day or so late in paying my phone bill etc. and the Loan Company wouldn't have a problem with that but 30 days is a whole other story. Being 30 days late is the story of my life, buddy. This little scene with the loan guy led me down the whole, why don't I pay my bills right on time, there are other people younger than me actually succeeding at this whole life thing so what the hell is my problem road.  Today was a better day. My mom is babysitting my niece over the weekend. Yay! She is so beautiful and fun and loving. Today she told me she was wearing her "baby suit" ...that's 3 yr old for "bathing suit". She can print alphabet letters, the only thing is she hasn't got the concept about there being an order to writing. She was writing out her dad's name and she'd put the letters all over the page and then show me and say, "Look I spelled daddy's name". Except instead of Mark she'd written RMkA. In the future she will create puzzles that people of all ages will enjoy and she will be rich and beautiful and famous and she will invite me to parties attended by celebrities and I will carry around a red autograph book and get people's autograph's while she smiles at me in a totally loving way and says to anyone staring, "That's my aunt!"  This  urlLink site  freeked me out! Any kind of growth unnatural to the environment scares me. It may be a natural mushroom but the fact its growing from behind somebody's wall gives me the ewww...please don't let it spread to my skin and grow out of my pores feeling.  I hope her mushroom goes away without her having to touch it or look at it too much.  I'm really sleepy tonight. Will talk more tomorrow.  December Blue ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz

						   Hi. I had an interesting and stressful weekend.  My neighbor "M" had a barbecue for her labmates on Saturday and asked me to please help.  So Friday we rented a car and went to the supermarket to shop for really expensive food.  She bought $45 dollar/ lb Salmon.  $45!!!   Then we woke up early on Saturday and my job was the grill. Hugely stressful keeping 3 grills going.  I worried that they wouldn't light and then I worried they'd turn off and then I worried they were too hot!    1 grill was for the vegetarians, and 2 for the meat eaters.  She made kebabobs...I helped with assembly and I made the hamburgers.  We had way too much food.   There's so much to tell about that day but its too complicated to go into detail.  All thoughts about jumbled up feelings and group dynamics are spinning around in my head and bumping into each other.  Too much to put down on "paper" and I don't want to relive it all.  Let it go...set it free.   Sunday was slightly less stressful and more fun.  There was a second barbecue organized by dogowners....(some day the dog owners in this building will band together and start a cult....we are that tight).  It was way more relaxing.  I did not have to entertain or cook (although I did supervise the cooking of my chicken because the grill guy was drunk and was trying to cook the chicken on coals that were almost out so I transferred the chicken to the grill that was still going...very cool of me to take the initiative.)   The conversation was more relaxed.  We didn't talk about grad school or parasites or passing parasites or splitting cells or cloning cells...favorite topics at Saturdays Lab Barbecue.  It was just a laid back good time.  There was one dog fight.  A few people brought their dogs down to the fenced in dog run while the rest of us sat around on the grass outside the run.  Just as we were relaxing and chatting we hear barking and growling and one of my fellow dog owners is in there all by herself with about 8 excited dogs and two of them, Boxers, are going at it.   I never knew my neighbors were so athletic.  A few of them climbed that fence with sandals on and its at least 8 feet high.  I left my dogs in the apartment or I'm sure I would've run in there too...but through the front gate not up the side.  I don't think I climb.  Maybe if I was being chased by a rabid animal I would climb the fence but even then I can't be sure.   My friend C told me she was in the subway in NY once when a guy started firing his gun.  Subway stations all look different in NY and she was at the one station where the stairs are endless.  Everyone uses the escalators to go back up...anyway she was wearing high heels when everyone started screaming and running back up the stairs.  She said she got up to about the 2nd level and stopped.  She decided to take her chances with the crazy gunman rather than climb up more stairs in high heels.   That would me my choice too.  I'm not going up the stairs and I'm not climbing the fence.  But its interesting to watch when other people do it.  Like watching COPS.  Letterman is better than Leno.  I've got Leno on in the background while I write this and the jokes are just soooo forced.  Give it up Leno.  Leave it alone.  Let it go...set it free.   Stockings with elastic bands that go around your thighs are a good invention for people who are forced to where pantyhose in the summer by their sadistic employers.  Be careful though, if you get the size that's too small...they won't stay up and they'll fall down around your knees just while you're walking by one of your boss's offices.   It can be very embarrassing if it hasn't already happened to you out in the street around lunch time when everyone is outside and can see you.  Yup.  Once its already happened its easier to deal with the embarrassment.  But still, its all worth not having to tug on pantyhose in humid 90 degree weather in your house that has no airconditioning.   Well, good night.  I must sleep now so that tomorrow I can stay awake when 3pm rolls around.  What is it about 3pm that makes me so sleepy?  Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite. December Blue.  P.S.  The Village was disappointing....I'll tell you why tomorrow.

						   Hi. Tomorrow I will see the D. My amazing secretary friend who moved on to greener pastures. I did allot of double work today. But actually, I secretly enjoy working allot. As long as I do it well, I like it allot. I like the feeling of accomplishment and the praise and that nice feeling at the end of the day...the hmmmm...I deserve this break, feeling.  What I don't like is being so stressed out that I fuck up or when some manager.....ahhh..let me stop myself there. I just thought about everything I wanted to say and you know what I just didn't feel like hashing it all out again by writing it and rewriting it. You are spared.  Tom Cruise is on TV. He was on Letterman last night. I had the volume turned down but I saw him laughing and spit came out of his mouth.  Nothing to interesting for me to write today except that I wanted to write just in case there is someone out there (besides me) reading these entries. Personally, I hate it when someone starts up a journal and then goes weeks and weeks without making an entry. I mean, what the fuck? If you weren't going to commit yourself to the whole process then why start it in the first place?  Lately I've been feeling like I look so old. Of course I do look older than I did 10 years ago, but in my head I look 67 when I really just look my age. (In the back of my head somewhere I've convinced myself I sort of resemble Mrs. Kerry.) I went through this same phase when I was 25. I went out and bought all kinds of anti-wrinkle creams and I remember my good friend C looking at me helplessly trying to figure out what to say when I asked her to recommend a good moisturizer for aging skin....she was only 23 at the time.  I remember when C sent me a prayer that her friend had sent her via email. It was a prayer for a husband. She was serious and I couldn't believe it. I feel bad now that at the time I judged her really harshly over that. I think I made fun of the poem and in my head she went down a couple of levels on my friendship meter. These days we don't talk for allot of reasons. The husband prayer is could be one of those reasons but there are others. She wasn't a great friend to me but at the time I didn't realize it. These days I think I know better how to say my feelings out loud but when I was in my 20's I was still learning.  The key to happiness might be opening your mouth.  Here is a reason why I am so wrinkle/aged obsessed. My mother has never really told me how old she is. She doesn't want anyone knowing. I sort of know how old she is but I can only ever confirm it by looking at her birth certificate because she will never tell. I've learned that this is very important to her and I will respect that. So even when she's not around and someone from work who's never met her asks me how old my mother is...I find it very difficult to say. Its the brainwashing. I sound like an idiot telling people that my mom doesn't want anyone to know how old she is and also I don't want anyone to think my mom is cuckoo. So I have decided (just now) that I will lie about my mom's age to strangers. Who's gonna know?? I will tell people my mom is 50. Yes! And I will tell people that I am 30. In this version my mom will have been a very young mom.  Well, once again I am getting sleepy at the keyboard. Have a good Friday.  December Blue

						   My neighbor told me it rained really hard yesterday morning.  She said the thunder was so loud it woke her up.  Later on I watched the news and they said allot of Philadelphia was flooded out because of the rain.   I slept through the entire storm...and I like storms.   In movies its always the people that sleep through the tragedies (or are in comas) that survive only to end up being the last people alive and walking around in their hospital gowns catching up on the news from abandoned newspapers and maybe from freedom fighters they meet up with in the street who are screaming at them to run away from the zombies or the flesh eating monster plants or whatever.   I think that would really suck.  I hope my neighbor or someone comes over to wake me up and tell me the killer plants are attacking so I can go downstairs and try to fight them off or something.   Still it would probably be kind of cool for a day or two after I got over the depression from finding out I was the only one left on the planet.  I'd probably check out people's houses.  On second thought, I'd have to find the freedom fighters.  Hopefully they would accept me....I think I'd be all like, "Hold me, I'm scared of the zombies.  No...I can't throw that molotove cocktail....I'm paralyzed by fear.  I'm sorry.  I'm a big scaredy cat.  Somebody should have woken me up!!!"  And they'd be all like, "She's holding us back man....feed her to the zombies.  She's cute and all and we want to reproduce with her but she's scared all the time and she keeps breaking into people's houses!"  Did you see that movie that came out recently? I think it was Dawn of the Dead or the Day After or something....it was the one where they were trapped in the Mall and decided to make a break for it by tricking out some armored trucks they found in the basement garage.  My question to you is...if by the end of the movie they'd figured out that zombiism was spread by zombie bites...why oh why didn't they wear protective suits.  They were in a mall...are you trying to tell me they couldn't find a long sleeve shirt, for goodness sake.  A sweater.  Wrap a thick floor mat around your arms...anything.  And what about when they landed on the island....wait a second before getting off the boat!!  Zombies aren't very smart.  They'll come out of hiding soon enough.  There was no need to get eaten by the zombies!!   Zombie movies are cool.     And in other news.  I need to start working on looking for a date.  Match.com here I come.  Maybe.   Well, I have to go to sleep now.  Must be fresh for my sucky job.  My job is starting to suck like a zombie sucks brains out of stupid mall people who wear tank tops and shorts when they escape.  They're making me do all sorts of secretay type stuff.  I'm a secretary but the stuff they are asking me to do are things that women did back before we had computers and email.  I mean come on folks.  People dictated because typing letters themselves was not time effecient (that's why I'd dictate a letter).  Its different in 2004.  These days by the time you dictate, proof read, edit, etc. etc. you could have done it yourself.  As a secretary I work on creating the intranet at my job and writing booklets for advertising their classes.  Its interesting and challenging.  Typing dictation isn't interesting at all.  Other things I hated doing at my previous job that I'm afraid they will ask me to do at this job which will make me quit are things like getting muffins and coffee.  "They didn't put the special sauce on my sandwich.  I can't eat this.  Would you get me another sandwich?"  Hey lady, its a meeting.  You didn't come here to enjoy the food...you came to meet and the food is a nice little benefit.  Get the sauce on your own time.  Please pray for me.  Pray that my job won't turn into one of those 1950's get me my coffee black with extra sugar jobs or that I'll have the courage to tell them they could put me to work in a more efficient, productive manner.  That I won't tell them to fuck off.   Thank you.  I'll write again soon. December Blue.
