      Hi Mom!  She is most likely the only person who will ever read this, but I figured this is a good way for you to keep up with what I'm up to.  I'll try to update it every day.  It might be tough, you know, since I'm sooooo busy every day.  I'm watching the Olympics right now, it's just past 10pm here on Saturday night.  Actually, I'm watching the local news, the Olympics just finished for the evening.  I watched some football for the first time today, and even though it was preseason and it wasn't the Packers, it was good to see football again.  I need something to watch and follow since the Brewers suck again.  I knew that would happen sooner or later.  I play EQ with Tony just about every day.  There are days where we go out on the town, so I don't talk to him every day.  I miss him a lot, although I don't think he thinks so.  I miss all of you (my family) too.  Matt isn't sure when his boat is going out now, but I will be home in October, anyway.  I really miss my cats and I'm looking forward to picking them up.  Matt and I are doing very well, I find myself in love with him more and more every day.  He is the sweetest person I've ever known.  He makes me realize every day that I am the most important person in his life.  He's still working nights.  We went to a concert last night, Blink 182.  It was pretty cool (but the crowd was very loud, 20,000+ teenage girls will do that.)  Well, I'm going to go and see if I can get this to actually post on my web site.  I'm going to try to come up with a home page design and put up some pictures.  I lost all of my previous content, which isn't a huge loss since t needed a lot of work, anyway.  Later!

      I ordered a double dresser, a 5-drawer upright dresser, and a night stand yesterday from a local online furniture store.  I got it this morning.  The store manager emailed me almost immediately, I called him this morning, and I had the furniture by noon.  Wow.  Anyway, the bedroom looks so much more clean now that clothes aren't in piles on the floor.  I have decided to spend a little bit of money on a new violin.  I am confident in my ability to recognize a good violin by sight (it's all in the back of the violin) so I placed a bid on one on Ebay.  Hopefully by tomorrow night I will be the owner of a brand new single-back violin in a beautiful leather case.  Mom, if you could, could you mail me my violin music?  :)  I also want to buy a bass guitar, because I think my violin experience would make me pretty good at it.  Besides, I tried 6-string and suck due to chords.  We ate at Chili's tonight, which was a nice change.  I haven't been feeling so great all day, though, and I am going to go to bed as soon as I'm done writing this.  I haven't watched the Olympics much today, but I did watch for a bit early this morning.  I really don't have a rant, but I do have another humorous observation.  There always seems to be at least one smart announcer and one not smart one.  Often times I am noticing the dumb one saying things like "That was good, right?"  The stupid moment of today has been the best of the Olympics so far.  It was during the Russia vs US water polo game, and the smart announcer was talking about how the Russia team has traveled all continents, as long as you don't count Antarctica and "Arctica."  I am not kidding.  LOL He quickly turned into the dumb announcer in my book.

      I'm noticing another trend as I watch the Olympics - a lot of the athletes from other countries are either US born or they attend school in the US. Now, if you were born in another country and attend college in the US, I can understand that you would want to play for your native country. However, if you are US born and raised, but you have some ancestry in another country, I'm not sure that qualifies you in my book to represent that country in the Olympics.  Example: I was watching the US vs Greek softball game the other night (the former Brewers TV announcer is commentating) and he stated that at least 75% of the Greek softball team is American born and raised. This just doesn't seem right to me. Another example: the old Jamaican woman that didn't make the Jamaican team was running for Slovenia.  So is this like pro sports now, where players are traded and have the liberty of playing for whatever country they want?  That's my rant for the day.  Mom, say 'hi' to everyone at Jeff and Linda's party for me.  You know how much I enjoyed going to those family functions, but I almost wish that I could go now.  I was excited to hear that you and Dad are going to Arizona for your anniversary.  I am looking forward to living there someday, and it would be awesome if you and Dad lived there, too.  :)

      I am learning how to cook!  Matt and I actually go grocery shopping, I plan our meals roughly a month ahead of time, I buy all the ingredients I need, and I actually stick to it.  It is not an easy task, though.  I bought a cookbook and I'm starting to learn that straying from the directions can make for some interesting concoctions.  Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.  Tonight I cooked meatloaf.  We didn't have any basil so I used oregeno.  We didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used crushed pretzels.  Etc etc.  It sure didn't turn out like Mom used to make, but it was edible.  There hasn't been anything yet that we've thrown out and ordered pizza.  Timing is my biggest challenge.  It's still hard for me to get the veggies and the potatos and the meat to finish at the same time.  I keep getting closer and closer, though.  Tonight's Olympic rant:  what is it all about?  Some say it is about world peace and hope; some training and hard work; some sportmanship and good will.  I say it is all about McDonalds and Visa.  Yep, commercials.  These commercials have been almost Super Bowl-like in quality, and I am noticing some eye-rolling trends.  Just about everything is being geared toward this Atkins low-carb BS.  I know some people lose weight this way, but some people lose weight eating nothing but junk food, too.  Even   beer  , yes, beer, is on the Atkins kick.  "Hey, get more drunk but don't get fat!"  LOL  But I do have to admit, the Budweiser low-carb games have been my personal favorite.  From the low jump to the 15-foot marathon, I chuckle every time I see them (which is 20 times a day.)

      Mom,  I am not there to give you a hug this year on your birthday, so I'll have to write the equivalent of a hug instead.  Several years ago, you gave me something that you had written.  I had never really even acknowledged it, but I still have it in a special folder.  It stated how you looked into my eyes when I was just born and told me that you loved me, and how the future hadn't really turned out like you had hoped.  Now that I have grown, I look back on my life and have great memories.  I remember things that might seem small to you, but to me they were quite big.  I remember when you literally bought a Robin Yount shirt off of a stranger's back because you knew I would like it.  I remember how scared I was when you and Dad took me to Grandma Turley's when you had Jessie.  I remember how much I wanted to give her back over the next decade or so  :P  I appreciate the fact that you and Dad let me grow up and think for myself.  I consider myself to be much stronger than a lot as a result.  I still use what we all learned during Dad's bout with cancer - hope for the best but expect the worst.  You never cease to amaze me in your support and love for me no matter what.  When I decided to blindly move to Hawaii, it made my life sooo much easier having the support of my family.  I know that if I need you, you are there unconditionally.  The same goes for me, Mom.  I am always just a phone call away.  If I were there, I would look into your eyes, tell you how beautiful I think you are, and how much I love you.  Happy birthday,  Chey

      Picture this scenario...  You are watching an exciting Olympic sport, let's say beach volleyball.  Let's imagine that the US is playing Croatia or something.  They are in the middle of a huge volley, the announcers are rambling on about a certain player and then they suddenly shut up (bad sign.)  You see the fade out and hear the sappy music start.  Then a deep male voice comes on and says "Lbulgia came from a poor family in the war-torn town of Zvgerbaih.  Her journey to the Olympics is a triumph that we all can learn from."  Then they go into the heartfelt story of Lbulgia's life.  I thought these were touching the first twenty times I saw them.  If you've watched the Olympics for more than fifteen minutes, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  They can make even the most well-off American equestrian "athletes" seem like they've had to fight for scraps of food to get to the Olympics.  And my "duh" moment from the announcers today happened just about an hour ago during women's rowing.  There were five boats - yellow, white, red, blue and green.  All five were in the camera's field of vision.  The announcer said "the red boat is in the lead."  Duh.  How about telling me what country that is?  I spent most of my day sleeping.  I took a couple sleeping pills after I posted last night and fell asleep shortly after.  I woke up at about 9:30 or 10:00 when Matt got home from work.  We played EQ for a while, then took a nap from about 12:30 to 4:00 or so.  I have been lounging around since then.  I have some laundry to do after this.  He should hopefully be home by 1:30am tonight, which is pretty cool.  His working nights kind of stinks because we can't really do anything.  I've been wanting to go to Dave & Busters, an adult arcade (meaning they serve alcohol, not a porn arcade) and play ski-ball, but he leaves for work around 6pm so we can't really do that.  He switches to first shift next week, but he's working 12 hour shifts so we still really can't do much.  Oh well, such is life in the Navy.  In other news today, I found out today that his sister is moving here next month.  I see advantages and disadvantages to this.  Well, I'm off to do some laundry.  Later!

      I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night.  Maybe a couple of hours with a little napping during today.  The Olympics have me pretty much glued to the TV, which leads me to my main rant for the evening.  Last night for over 1.5 hours the only Olympic "sport" on was the equestrian.  This is a sport?!?!  For 90 minutes of my time I had to watch rich snobs dressed like complete weenies riding horses in circles for far too long at a time.  The kicker was that the horse did all the work, and the commentators only talked about the horses.  I didn't stick around to see the end result, but I sure hope that they hung the medals on the horses' necks.  At the moment I am watching the Wisconsin Hamm twins about to seal a medal for the US men's team gymnastics.  Go cheeseheads.  The US is really not doing too well from what I've seen during these games.  A couple of nights ago Matt and I watched a special on the History Channel on the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Today I heard a low-flying plane, and even though I have visited the USS Arizona Memorial, it hadn't really dawned on me before that I am  living  only a mile or two from that actual attack spot.  I can see the north end of the harbor from my balcony.  I took a couple of minutes today to try and imagine what that must have sounded like from where I am sitting right now.  It's kind of eerie.  It's also kind of cool to know that my grandma was stationed on this same island almost sixty years ago.  I am looking forward to talking to her when I return home in October.  That reminds me, I need to get my tickets soon.  Well, after this gymnastics competition is over, I am going to try and get some sleep.  Later!

      Good morning! It's early Monday morning here, and I just finished cleaning the bathroom and took a shower. I haven't dried off since the first shower I took here. It is so warm that you are almost always sweating. I really don't notice the heat, I actually enjoy it now. It's nothing that a couple of fans can't fix. Of course, the breeze at 22 floors up helps, too. The apartment seems to be set up so there is almost a wind tunnel between the living room and the master bedroom. The hallway is fairly long, and we have fans set up at the ends of it. I have learned not to like air conditioned buildings - the temperature contrast makes you notice the heat more. When I watched the news tonight, the humidity was 78%, which is less than it is back home. Looking at the extended forcast, it is supposed to be a solid 90 degrees the next week. I love it here :)  I found a really cool web site last night while I was trying to see if I could find a cached copy of my old web site. Check this out, a site that goes out and saves copies of different versions of web sites. It doesn't save the pictures, but it does save the text and formatting.  urlLink http://www.archive.org/web/web.php  That's pretty cool.  I've been watching the Olympics tonight, and I was kind of glad to see the US basketball take a fall like it did tonight. I think it's good for them to have their egos slapped around a bit. My favorite event of the evening was probably water polo. That's a fairly entertaining sport to watch. Right now it's just a bunch of blah blah blah. That reminds me, I have this TIVO type of thing that is a part of the digital cable box, so I can just fast forward through this. There, now it's women's swimming. Haha technology rocks.  I'm off to play on pogo.com. Have a good day! Chey

      My apartment overlooks H1, Hawaii's "interstate" (think about that one for a second, they actually have it labeled that way.)  I can tell what time it is by the backup of the traffic.  From my observations, if you want to get anywhere in Honolulu (10th largest city in the US), don't drive while it's light out.  The highway starts backing up around 5:00am and clears up by 9:00am, then backs up again around lunchtime, then again at 2:30pm and clears up around 7:00pm.  It's only going to get worse now that the University of Hawaii is back in session.  I'm glad I don't have to drive anywhere  :)  I really have no rant for the day.  I spent most of my day making lasagna and cleaning.  I ended up winning that violin from Ebay, and I'm looking forward to getting it.
