      im quite steady fishing but nv before on a boat. yesterday was quite an experience. hardly gt any fish because of strong wind at the southern part of singapore. we started at 6. 4 hrs later, still no sign of fish. i was getting abit frustrated as fishing on a boat is totally different than fishing by the beach or at the jetty. the movement of the boat because of the waves at times make me want to puke. around 11, i slept. my dad and his friends continued fishing. by the time i woke up next morning, they had started packing. i checked the cooler, and shocked to see two baby sharks and a number of small fishes. nt bad heh? ok la, later yea.

       ms chua gave us three days to come up with a game based on poa. my group consists of four ppl, including myself. now, i cannot get hold two of the members. that leaves me with sarath left. pissed me off when he said tht he will nt show up if javis nv come. fuck right! abey tinggal kn aku sorang ah nk buat assignment ni?! useless to show my anger now. its important i get it done with or without the help of my grp. but i cant think of any kind of game which needs poa as its foundation. monopoly will quite a burden, i cant possibly do it on my own. dont know ah ..

      em. dont feel so good today. sch was alright, sdsp was great. the only thing was i felt my brain compressing, quite pain. in class, the normal jokers; imran, sarath javis straight shoot at mr long by saying 'was!'. our class has started this 'was!' phenomena. the term 'was!' is shortened for 'was that meant to be a joke?!' wahaha. as normal, mr long would give lame jokes. having nothing to do, sarath voiced out first. mr long was saying something about eminem lyrics 'will the real slim shady pls stand up' bcos all of us were still sitting down when he stepped in front of the class (pg lesson). then sarath went 'WAS!'. the whole class cracked. mr long didnt understand wat it meant and so, heck care. the class was already sitted after grooming themselves with the tie except me. mr long said to the whole class 'farid, how long you want to take to finish tying ur tie? two periods of pg?' he said with a grin. i laughed and said 'was!' the whole class laughed again. then sri approached me and said jokingly in malay 'eh farid, pompuan pun kalah la. lama nah kau siap?!' hm. nt looking fwd to much tmr also dah. hm, poa mock test, math test and chem test. lol, looking fwd to = i, robot = release date 29/7. em, had a chat with aidah. weird was wat her 1st impression of me. then she said when she gt to know me, she said ok ah. hm, the funny part was she wont sit still and laugh when i wanted to take her photo. hehe, tht was 'the moment of the week' so far. thts all, later yea.

      hm. she noes everything, well .. almost everything to say the least. nvm tht. everything went well during oral this afternoon only for the conversation part that messed it all up. the question asked: have u watched any festive celebration put up by any racial group? the first killer qn that had me went blank. normally im quite an easy smooth speaker even with strangers. i answered: em. er. ar. ive watched a chinese festive celebration performed by CHINESE - like durh! em. er. they set up a nice formation and finish off with one dancer executing an acrobatic move. then, i asked them to ask a diff qn. the teachers gave a laugh and asked me to elaborate the first qn. i broke down but nv shed a tear. my confidence sank. i kept silent thru for the following qns asked. a dismay day, yet again. woa, still gt poa test tmr. how long will this prolong?! at least something nice happened. like the old saying goes; theres nv a day dat passed by with just bad news. well yea, at least theres something to look fwd to tmr. hope everything goes to plan. like the saying goes; kite hanya merancang, allah menentukan segalanya. in other words; we can only plan, god will decide everything. hm. im getting worked out. later yea.

      em, took my mt listening compre this morning. kirsten dunst is sweet! yea! lol. my dad just booked a boat for the whole family for a fishing trip. to say no to him would be hard as we have nt went out as a family for quite a while. i was like 50:50 whether to go or nt as i'll be having poa and math test next week respectively. i finally gt my motivation to strive for o'level because of someone. her family status is good, so i imagined me marrying her. to think of my level of qualification now would be impossible to support her. so this 'dream' had make a great impact on me yesterday. i spent solid 4 hrs covering my physics as in writing in point form for the first four chp. to see whether i'll make it this o'level, just wait and see. later yea.

      fun day i had. sch was nt bad. yesterday was fun too. faizal, imran and me went hyper siao and started doing things i nv thought of doing. we did some stunts that from my point of view, rather risky. anyway, back to today. after fri prayers, went back home and gt dressed up b4 watching spiderman 2. wow! spiderman's identity have been revealed. very unexpected. but i was quite happy at the same time as mj gt to know who peter really was and yea, the romantic part very shiok. for sure there will be spiderman 3. likley villain this time will be harry. likely reasons will be avenging his father's death and getting back mj from peter. looking fwd! :P well, aidah accompanied me other than faizal, imran and gek teng. i have this crush on her but im thinking nt to rush into anything with o level fast approaching. dont know her much but so far so gd. our relationship is building quite steadily. thts all, later yea.
