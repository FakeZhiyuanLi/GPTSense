      I got my schedule yesterday.  Annie and I have no class together...Sad.  But my schedule is going to have to be changed.  I didn't get any English class, instead I got minority and women's studies.  I wouldn't mind taking min/wo studies ,but English is slightly more necessary.  Any who my schedule as of now is as follows:  1  Adv. US History  Newmark 2  Adv. Chemistry   Grant 3  Min/wo studies   Klien 4  Drama III        Rasnick 5  Adv. Alg II      Huddleston 6  Spanish I        Ade  Grr so the only AP class I was brave enough to sign up for and It's not on my schedule.  Hopefully it will be all figured out soon though...I was actually looking forward to AP English.  Well we'll see what happens, I just hope my whole schedule doesn't get screwed up.  Oh and also I think the first day of school is going to be so confusing.  Book sale? Orientaion sessions?  Math assessment?  College counseling?  ahhh I'm confused already, well not confused just overwhelmed!  And also for this book sale do I need to bring money, and if so how much b/c are we buying text books? Aren't they expensive? So many questions, so many answers...I hope, any comments current RCHSers?

      DISNEY DISNEY DISNEY!   Ah ha I can't wait to go on vacation!  It's so close...It's killing me...I hate waiting.  Ahhh but the sooner it comes, the sooner it ends...Sad but true!  Yesterday was Jessica's going away party.  SURPRISE going away party I might add.  And she didn't have a clue, which is great because it's hard to keep a secret from Jessie k.  It was a great party if I do say so myself.  I think Jessica Dial was more excited about the surprise than Jessie K though!  After the guest of honor arrived we ate; the spread included...Fruit salsa, cinnamon tortilla chips, fresh fruit with Hawaiian fruit dip, pasta salad, pigs in a blanket (with cheese!), pizza (which was almost a calzone!) and chez' of the cake for dessert (translation chez' of the cake = cheese cake).  After eating we played a quiz game, made up by Annie herself.  I sucked at this game I might add, and there was a prize at stake.  Jeannine won, that damn little swimmer...hehe.  Then we played Malarky...It's a game much like a watered down version of Hollywood Squares... Minus the stars, and the squares.  And umm who won...Yes that's right I did!  Then we went for a walk...In the dark...And the humidity.  It was fun, scary, but fun.  Well actually it was only scary for Jess D. and me, everyone else handled it quite well.  We walked to the lake and chatted there until it started to sprinkle.  Back at home we did the PJ thing and went to bed...Exciting I know.  This morning, after breakfast...Oh breakfast was an event, we went to go see the Notebook.  Holy moly mother....It was so good.  Now granted I am a sucker for the chick flick romantic comedy, but this one was really really good.  Seriously I don't think there was a dry eye in the house.  And you heard it here first ladies and gents...I think Ryan Gosling (i think that is how you spell it) is going to be a really big star.  He was awesome...And quite attrative.  Also you know how most books turned movies don't do the book justice? Well The Notebook really stayed true to the novel and the plot was only slightly ajusted.  So after the movie we all caravaned over to Jessie K's house for cake and our last good byes.  So that was the end...Jess is leaving July 1st.  But it was a great day, a great way to say goodbye!     I'm off now to continue packing! Later kids  BYE JESSIE K....I'll miss you and best of luck in Dallas!

      Yay, okay it's working now!  Last night it wouldn't let me post so I'm glad everything is working now!  Anyway or anyways ,which ever you prefer, it's been awhile since my last post.  I can't blame it all on a computer malfunction...I've just been busy.  I leave for Florida soon, which is so exciting.  Everyone who knows me, knows I live in a house full of Disney freaks, but we are venturing off the Disney path a bit this trip.  We decided to visit Universal Studios as well.  We'll see if I like it....hmm i just don't know.  So I've been packing like crazy for the trip.  Packing is definitely the worst part of vacationing.  It seems to never end.  And I have million lists...I have a list of what to pack, what to put in the car, what to buy....ahhh now I'm making a freaking list of all my lists.  This is getting out of hand.    Ahh ha and musical theater ended last Friday.  Our "sharing" went well.  There were more people at it then I expected.  Mostly parents though so it was really a no pressure performance. (Except Tom Martin was there, and Jeannine and Jessie K came!)  But now it's over and life is back to normal, because really there is nothing normal about a bunch of teenagers (most of whom being girls that think they are fat) singing and dancing and acting there little hearts out all day long.  Sometimes I wonder...Why do I love the theater? hmmm...O but I do love it!  Jess is moving at the end of this month.  She's leaving the state but really the entirety of my sophomore "group" is moving.  Jeannine is going to Saint Davids (go STD!),Annie is following me to Raleigh Charter ,and Jessica D is the only one staying at Athens.  I feel like we all should have some sappy, Full House moment together...There would be bad music playing the background and we'd all sit in a circle and tell about our favorite memories together...Tear...haha just kidding actually it's kind of cool that we are all parting ways.  Not cool in the "I hate being around you people" way, cool like we're watching eachother grow up.....talk about your Full House, sappy moment.  Moving on I GET MY CAR TODAY!  Dad is taking me to pick it up at 4:30 this afternoon! yay yay yay!  And on that note I must depart!  Later kids

      Musical theater is over...The open classroom went well on Friday.  There were a lot of people there, well just more than I thought I guess.  But now that it's over my summer is back to normal, because honestly there is nothing normal about a  bunch of teenagers singing their hearts out everyday.  Ahh but that's why I love the theater right?  And I don't mean to gush but everything is going pretty damn good these days.  I got my room painted already this summer.  I leave for Disney soon, I can't wait to go.  I just got a car, yes ladies and gents, I am now the proud owner of a maroon, jeep Wagoner.  And it's a beautiful day...All I need now is a knight in shining armor to ride up on his white horse, sweep me off my feet, and we'll go riding off into the sunset.  Well don't I sound like a regular Polyanna? Maybe not Polyanna, but I do sound like some equally sweet fictional character like Snow White or Kermit the Frog...Well maybe not Kermit.  But the thought of how happy I am makes even me want to gag.  Alright well I'm off to partake in the customary Father's Day dinner, it consists of cedar plank salmon, broccoli, orzo, and crusty whole wheat rolls.....My mouth is watering!  Later

      P.S.  I forgot to give a shout out to Bethany..."I thought you were the others", "Why are you telling me?", "You raise me up", o and so many more!  We're in class together to keep eachother sane!    Also any fans of last comic standing?  hmm well if not you should be...It's reality TV at it's best.    that's all, I'm off to bed...I know it's early but you know what they say...Early to bed early to rise and the early bird gets the worm....hmm who really says that???  later

      Let me begin by saying that I have a cold.  Why oh why must my immune system always fail me?  I even followed Jessica's advice and now have TWO yes two plants in my room...They aren't helping, although they are lovely to look at.  My nose is stuffed and throat if dry and all that good stuff that goes along with the incurable common cold.  Which means I'm in perfect form to be in a MUSICAL theater class all week...grrr.  Well enough of that ranting.  Truth is it hasn't been that bad of a cold...hopefully by Friday I'll be out from under the weather.  After class today Dad and I stopped by everyone's favorite coffee house, Starbucks.  I of course got a vanilla soy chai tea latte, which reminds me of certain someone who shares my joy in this fabulous drink.  Then we went to look at cars.  I fell in love with this 1990 Jeep Wagoner.  It's maroon, and adorable.  We'll see though...Okay well I'm out kids! Later

      Ah ha the Victoria's secret semi annual sale started today...And really who doesn't love cheap bras?  Mom and I, in true Hanehan bargain shopping fashion, got up early today so we could be there at 9:00...Yes in the morning.  So after rummaging through many bins of lingerie we checked out and scooted on over to musical theater.  (Also I must ask...Is it weird that I don't cringe at the thought of undie shopping with my mom? hmm we are the odd couple I suppose.)  So after stopping at Starbucks mom dropped me off at RLT.  Class seemed long today.  Perhaps it was because I sung my heart out and the fact that we started dancing right off the bat at 9:30 in the morning.   Whatever the reason, I have a bit of a sractchy throat.  Ahh that's all cross our fingers and say a prayer that I don't get sick!     Hahahah just thought I'd add too that I was watching E! Today after school and they showed one of those TrimSpa commericals with Anna Nicole Smith.  It always makes me laugh..."TrimSpa baby"...o Anne Nicole your boobies are so fake, but at least your skinny now!    later kids

      Yesterday Mom and I trekked on down to my grandmothers house.  Not much exictment there.  We were supposedly going down to celebrate my mom's birthday.  The celebration included the opening of a card and a thank you.  Woo Hoo par-tay.  But I did make fabulous grilled cheese w/tomato sandwiches for everyone, I would have to say they were the highlight of the celebration.  After a rousing day at my grannies I ushered for Somkey Joe's Cafe at RLT.  Mom and Annie tagged along.  We arrived a wee bit late, only because the parking was crazy.  But the rest of the night went smoothly.  The show was fun, the cast was great...Except fot that one white guy who couldn't dance.  Other than him it was refreshing to see some new faces on the RLT stage.  Perhaps it was because Allison Lawrence directed it, but anyways it was cute...Long but enjoyable.  Today is Mom's 51st....gee my mom's old, birthday so I'm off to the grocery store to buy food for tonight's birthday dinner. later

      O TGIF....Wow i definitely haven't said that phrase in a while.  It has a long week though.  Not to say it hasn't been a good one, don't worry mom and pop your money's been well spent, it's just been long.  Getting up early, dancing and singing all day; it just ain't easy.  (does the word ain't have an ' in it? hmm)  We finally choreographed all of our numbers and beside Telephone Hour they all look pretty good.   Next week we'll work on the acting stuff.  I think we'll be ready to share by next Friday.  Everyone should come check it out....Musical Theater open classroom/final sharing NEXT FRIDAY the 18th 5:15ish in the Gaddy Goodwin Theater @ Raleigh Little Theater.     The only thing odd about the class is the dichotomy of the group of kids.  We're only 15 strong so it's not a large enough group to have "clicks" and it's not a small enough group for everyone to get along with everyone else.  So sometimes the social end of class is.....Entertaining.  We all get along fairly well though.  Today we had a laugh fest at lunch.....You know how it is when you start laughing about something and then everything makes you laugh even if it's stupid?  Well that's how it was today.  I talked to my lil' hommie Jeannine today.  We had a nice little chat on the telephone.  (pothtoes...umm pottatoes....err potatoes 5 cents)  haha that little swimmer cracks me up, errrm (i can't believe i use the term errm now...Leave it to Mr. rinkle to get me hooked) when i say little swimmer i mean that she really is on swim team and such ,that wasn't a reference to sperm.  But I'll get to see all my Athens friends on Thursday for Jessica's birthday party.  That will be nice.  It's been weird not seeing them everyday.  I guess I'll have to get used to it...the gang is going to be torn apart after this summer, that sounded really sad. It's not that sad really, i mean we will all still be a "group" just not at the same school....or in the same state.  Annie was practicing driving to Raleigh Charter today.  I really have to get on that too.  Watch us get lost the first day...ahhh the two of us in a carpool, it's a scary thing.    Well that's all for now...Later kids

      Today was another day filled with musical theater.  We worked through most of our music today.  I am so excited that I get to sing a duet with Katie Kapp.  We were meant to sing together!  Also it's just fun to laugh with Katie, because that's what we do when we are together, laugh!  Hahaha "I can't wait until dinner.....Shhhhhooooo hungry", "What ev.........er", "Hey Mama, Say Mama"!  Good times with the Kappster!    We ate out in the amphitheater, it was quite muggy outside but a large improvement from the chilly Gaddy Goodwin.  After lunch we sang some more and worked through out first improv scene.  Fun stuff...  After class the folks and I went to dinner at Moe's...."Welcome to Moe's".  I had a full monty, it was either that or the ugly naked guy. haha I love a restaurant who names their food ugly naked guy!  And we went car shopping!  Ahh yessss the excitement of car shopping.  We found a 96' Jeep Grande Cherokee.  It's green with black leather interior.  It is a little ruff cosmeticly but other than that it looks pretty good.   Sadly it was slightly out of my price range so onward we go on our quest for the perfect midsized SUV for little ole me!  That's about it.....later

      My day started at 7:00 when my mother woke me up to do a Denise Austin Daily Workout video.  Ahh working out with my mother at 7 in the morning is definitely my idea of the perfect summer. But actually it is nice....errrm...bonding time. After a half hour with Mrs. Austin and my mother I took a shower, ate breakfast (Granola with raisins and vanilla soy milk mmmm), got dressed, and headed off to RLT for Musical Theater class.    Class was good, surprisingly tiring though.  And there aren't as many musical theater regulars in the class, i mean to say that I didn't know a huge amount of the kids.  Bethany Hill and Katie Kapp are in class and they make me happy.  The only other returning musical theaterier (that's not a word) is William Thompson, our TA.  So after meeting all the new faces we circled up and played a little woosh bong and a game called what are you doing? We did a little character stuff and Rob explained the way things are going to go and such.  Then it was lunch.  I got to see the new bathrooms downstairs, very nice very nice.  I especially love the large showers..."You could fit a lot of people in here"...And the removable shower head.  After lunch Freddie Lee arrived and we danced like crazy.  Fun stuff though, we learned the choreography to Hairspray's You Can't Stop The Beat.  After dancing we got assigned some of our parts....I play "the smart girl" ha.  AND I'm singing On my Own from Les Mis, I'm in Love from South Pacific with Katie Kapp, and Forget about the Boy from thoroughly Modern Millie.  Ahhh so exicting.    After class my ma and I went to the Bath and Body works BIG sale. It was madness.  There were large groups of middle aged women swarming the bins of dollar soaps and 75% off gift sets.  Sadly I had no luck finding anything.  My mother managed to swipe up the last of refills for this crazy electric car freshener she has though.  And how bout' them Tony awards last night?  SOOOO good, Avenue Q is the funniest thing to happen to musical theater in a long while.  And Hugh Jackmen is my new love....ahh and he was in gold pants and a leopard shirt....soooo hot!  haha alrighty kiddies that is about all for me....Later

      Summer is finally here and I decided to create this blog to keep tabs on myself and others throughout the vacation.  But I must admit, I probably won't be religiously faithful in my postings and I'm not the most technologically advanced human being so my bet is that my blog will be quite boring.  Just as long as we have all of that out on the table.  Today it was gray outside...And that's how I felt...gray.  It was just one of those days where you wake up in a sucky mood.  Also I feel like something is missing, I don't even know what really.  BUT I start musical theater at Raleigh Little Theater tomorrow morning.  Perhaps that will "complete me".  I really love being at the theater, I love everything about it.  In fact I was just there last night with Mr. Ryan Rinkel.  We had the pleasure of viewing "New Works and Old Works Reworked".  It was a production of several short plays, each quite varied in subject.  Being the light hearted audience member that I am, I enjoyed the comedic selections the best.  (Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good Ernest Hemminway every now and then; even ones about abortion)  Anna, Claire, and Simon wrote, directed, and starred in a hilarious piece entitled      The Evolution of the Death Penalty.   It doesn't sound funny...But it was.  I also really enjoyed   Papas   and   Who's on First.    It was great to the RLT crew again.  After the show we stayed to chat with the cast and then we helped pop the many balloons covering the floor of the Gaddy lobby.  Then Ryan and I bummed a ride from Amanda Bitler.  After much searching for Ms. Bitler, and a phone call to Amanda's house we finally headed over to Starbucks.  Just our luck, it had closed at nine.  After a quick change in plans we headed over to Cafe Cyclo (did I spell that right?).  It was a cute, eclectic place in Cameron village.  The chai was nothing to rave about, but the atmosphere made up for what my beverage was lacking.  After sipping on my drink and conversing with Ryan and Amanda a bit my mother came to pick me up.  It was an enjoyable night filled with little old ladies at RLT, scary men with Jackie Chan shirts, confessions of brownie preferences (nuts or no nuts?), and more balloon popping than I ever wanted to experience.

      Today I was home alone...But the whole day wasn't a total waste. I got to sleep in, which was great, and then I ate some breakfast.&nbsp; After doing a little work out with Denise I went in the pool and then laid out....curse that Disney tan.&nbsp; But it wasn't all fun and games my friend, while I laid out I read the last of the short stories for summer reading.&nbsp; That's what&nbsp;I like to&nbsp;call multi-tasking.&nbsp; I came in slightly bronzed and filled with literacy.&nbsp; I finished my second paper for English...yay two down one more to go.&nbsp; And then mom came home and we ran some errands.&nbsp; And finally I went out for ice cream with the cool kids... you  know who you are...hehe.&nbsp;   Yesterday my dad and I decided to spend a little quality time together...fun stuff.&nbsp; We watched Bringing Down the House.&nbsp; Officially the stupidest movie I've ever seen.&nbsp; And I'm a big fan&nbsp;of Steve Martin....It was a real disappointment Steve, what happened to great ,quality ,comedy films like Parenthood and Father of the Bride..Not to mention Father of the Bride Part two.&nbsp; There were a couple funny one liners and such, but overall it was just a bad movie with far too many racial slurs.&nbsp;   Alright well that's about it kids....Later

      Well it's been quite the eventful night here at the Hanehan household.&nbsp; I was just minding my own business, watching a little Newlyweds in my bed, trying to fall asleep,&nbsp;when I get a little growing pain in my leg.&nbsp; Normal story thus far.&nbsp; So I moozy on down stairs to take some Tylenol before the pain of my growth gets too bad.&nbsp; I rummaged around in the medicine cabinet, take down the bottle, get myself some pain killers, and pour a little glass of water.&nbsp; So I'm sipping down the pills ,and if you've ever been in my house you know that the kitchen and dining room are like all windows, so I was looking out the windows and I see a guy run by.&nbsp; Well and&nbsp;I handle crisis sooooooo well so what do I do...After you know&nbsp;WETTING MY PANTS...I run into the living room to hide.&nbsp; In the process of hiding&nbsp;I see two other blobs of movement outside which I assume&nbsp;are two more guys.&nbsp; Okay so now I'm officially spooked and contemplating the necessity of screaming.&nbsp; I look out the window just in time to catch the get away car speeding away, the idiots even gave a little toot toot.&nbsp; Losers...So any ways I go into my parents bedroom and wake up my dad with this great line "umm dad there were some guys outside..." A great wake up call I know.&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad gets up and grabs first a flashlight and second a baseball bat...o gosh gotta&nbsp;love that guy!&nbsp; He goes outside to investigate&nbsp;only to&nbsp;find my brothers car covered in saving cream.&nbsp; A juvenile prank I must&nbsp;say.&nbsp; o how lame....The&nbsp;drama of teenage boyhood pranks....Stupid that's what&nbsp;I call it.&nbsp; Also what loser has the time to&nbsp;drive around at midnight on Tuesday night&nbsp;to find some kids house and put shaving cream on his car?&nbsp; Shouldn't they be doing something constructive...Excuse me while&nbsp;I get up&nbsp;on my soap box...This is what's wrong with today's youth.&nbsp; If kids put all the energy&nbsp;that they put into petty, ridiculous pranks such as the above into something useful perhaps there wouldn't be so many homeless or hungry...At least there be a few more men with a decent shave...Just think of all that wasted shaving cream...It's a shame really.&nbsp; well&nbsp;now that that exictment is over I shall try to sleep...But I still have that freakin&nbsp;growing pain!   p.s.&nbsp;jk about the wetting my pants part....That didn't really happen I just thought it added to the story.  later&nbsp;

      Yesterday Ma and I went up to Triangle Town Center.&nbsp; And I successfully tackled Capital Blvd.!&nbsp; This is a big step for my mother, letting me drive in heavily congested areas.&nbsp; The drive went really well and on our way up to the mall we tried out the route to Raleigh Charter.&nbsp; It really won't be a bad drive for Annie and I, it's pretty direct and all.&nbsp; The margin for error is quite small.&nbsp; So after proving to my mom that I can drive with other vechicles present, we stopped by SUPER Target...Yes I know what you're thinking...What could possibly make Target any more super than it already is?&nbsp; Well a grocery store, an optical center, and a Starbucks that's what.&nbsp; It was Target heaven, mom and I concluded that if they had strategically placed a Motel Six next door one could live in this Target.&nbsp; We cruised the clearance of just about every department, even groceries..I for one am not all about buying groceries on clearance but hey whatever tickles your fancy.&nbsp; And we proceeded to the checkout, leaving with a small load&nbsp;that included two pairs of funky,&nbsp;highlighter-bright tights, a pair of fake Ugg boots, in tan being the sensible shoe&nbsp;buyer that I am, and some gum.&nbsp; A haul that doesn't even compare to the magnitude of&nbsp;all that is SUPER Target.&nbsp; After that excitment we headed over to the mall.&nbsp; We had lunch at the Twisted Fork, an artsy, modern restaurant that had reasonable prices and&nbsp;great lunch fare.&nbsp; Mom had a turkey Ruben and a bowl of Italian wedding soup and I had the pleasure of enjoying portebella mushroom Alfredo.&nbsp; Oh it's so gooood!&nbsp;&nbsp;After lunch we&nbsp;shopped a bit and headed home!   I starting watching the democratic National Convention today.&nbsp; Oh the Fleet Center&nbsp;was in it's glory,&nbsp;decked out in patriotic garb, 90 foot video screen and all ( I&nbsp;have to say that the 90 foot screen was a bit excessive).&nbsp; I was joined by&nbsp;my good friend Dan Rather, quite the newscasters he is!&nbsp; I didn't get to far because I had to run up to RCHS to change my schedule but what I did see so far was hmm good?&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how exactly you describe a convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;It started with a memorial for September 11th.&nbsp;&nbsp;Glenn Close completely murdered her monologue about nevering forgetting the events of September 11th.&nbsp; She was&nbsp;so clearly reading off a teleprompter that it was painful to watch.&nbsp; Geez these professional actors&nbsp;have no place at a political convention!&nbsp; Unless your Ben Affleck or some other equally good looking Democratic supporter, then I'm sure the delegates could make some room for you!&nbsp; Well some of the highlights so far include...The random shot of some girl looking at the ceiling during&nbsp;the spet. 11th speech, Al Gore being called the cheerleader of the democracies party,&nbsp;Dan Rather saying the Mr. Kerry plans on making "an army of retail politicians", and my favorite quote so far "what unites is is stronger than what divides us".&nbsp;   My schedule has been changed, I know have an English class....So here it is in all it's glory!   1&nbsp; adv alg II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rm. 107&nbsp;&nbsp; Huddleston  2&nbsp; adv chem.&nbsp; rm. 310&nbsp; Grant  3&nbsp; adv us his.&nbsp; rm. 305&nbsp; Montague  4&nbsp; Drama III&nbsp; rm. 313&nbsp; Rasnick  5&nbsp; Spanish I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm. 320 Ade  6 AP&nbsp;english&nbsp; rm.&nbsp; 208&nbsp; Chabfoux (hmm i think i spelled that wrong...?)   so there it is....yay I will soon be a RCHS student!!   later&nbsp;

      I went to go see The Phantom Tollbooth today with Kirsten.&nbsp; Quite the funny show, I must say.&nbsp; Outstanding performances by Molly and Fagean!&nbsp; Also I was so happy to see Josh Silver in a lead role, what a cutie! I remember reading the book when I was little, but I didn't recall much of the plot line.&nbsp; It's basically the story of a young boy, Milo, who goes on this crazy journey through the lands of words and numbers.&nbsp; It reminded me of Alice in Wonderland.&nbsp; After the show Kirsten and I jetted over to Baskin and Robins...It was great.&nbsp; KK got Maui chocolate (chocolate icecream, fudge swirls, and Macadamia nuts) &nbsp;in a cup and I had the pleasure of eating coconut ice cream with pineapple in a cone...I don't remember the name, but I&nbsp;made one up...Dole Whip poser.&nbsp; It was much like the beloved dole whip from magic kingdom...."This ones&nbsp;on goofy"...o good times good times.&nbsp; After downing out frozen treats we once again braved the streets of downtown Raleigh and headed home.&nbsp; Kirsten came in to see the new additions to my room and of course to&nbsp;be pestered&nbsp;by my dogs...grr.&nbsp; Then she headed back home...so that was&nbsp;my day in a nutshell.   I finished my paper on Accidental Tourist today and I started reading the short stories..o summer reading.&nbsp; It hasn't been toooooo horribly painful, at least I enjoyed Accidental Tourist, unlike some people...sorry Annie!&nbsp; "I hate this book, it's like I open it up and it's just words..."&nbsp; o that Annie, she's currently in NJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's due back aug. 2nd and then we gotta start practicing the drive&nbsp;to RCHS...haha yess we are losers. so any ways thats about it! later&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      My favorite passage from a book...ever. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Charles said, "I never told you this before, but it's my opinion sex is overrated." Macon looked at him. &nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh when&nbsp;I was in my teens I was as interested as anyone," Charles said, "I mean it occupied my thoughts for every waking moment and all that.&nbsp; But that was just the idea of sex you know? Somehow the real thing was less ...I don't mean I'm opposed to it, but it's just not all I expected.&nbsp; For one thing, it's rather messy.&nbsp; And then the weather is such a problem." &nbsp;&nbsp; "Weather?" Macon said. &nbsp;&nbsp; "When it's cold you hate to take your clothes off.&nbsp; When it's hot you're both so sticky.&nbsp; And in Baltimore, it does always seem to be either too cold or too hot." &nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe you ought to consider a change of climate," Macon said.&nbsp; He was beginning to enjoy himself.&nbsp; " Do you suppose anyone's done a survey?&nbsp; City by city? Maybe the Businessman's Press could put out some sort of pamphlet." -The Accidental Tourist &nbsp; &nbsp; My thoughts on the above include....Thank goodness I don't live in Baltimore,&nbsp; I really do wonder if someone has done a survery, and If the Businessman's Press did put out some sort of pamphlet, you know city by city,&nbsp;I would buy it. &nbsp; Needless to say, I am ,for once in the history of my school career, enjoying my summer reading.&nbsp; &nbsp;

       Last night I went to see Big Fish at the art museum's outdoor theater.&nbsp; My partners in crime ( or should I say pirates...In crime ) included Ms. Annie Gray, Jessica Dial, Jeannine Erasmus, and my mom.&nbsp; Mom drove because of that pesky law about one passenger per car and that thing about not driving after nine, stupid laws if you ask me.&nbsp; The movie was pleasant, but the company was better.&nbsp; It was really fun being with the whole gang.&nbsp; My dad once told us that when we get together all we do is talk, but we aren't saying a thing, rather harsh I know, but so far from the truth.&nbsp; Perhaps what we talk about doesn't have much substance, but does much of anything these days?&nbsp; We could talk about politics, but that just makes someone angry.&nbsp; We could talk about religion, but someone is bound to get insulted.&nbsp; So instead of speaking of the above mentioned topics, both of which are filled with substance, we choose to talk about pirates, crewmates, I Love the 90's, Anchorman, Annie and&nbsp;I wearing the same jacket, guys in pink shirts, cars filled with teenagers who don't know how to drive forward, etc. etc.&nbsp; Now I think all those things are fabulous topics for conversation, I suppose some people, mainly my dad, would disagree.&nbsp; But whether we are saying anything or not we have a lot of freakin fun together.&nbsp; I would suggest seeing a movie at the art museum to anyone, especially to those artsy couples who are looking for a cute date.&nbsp; On the back side of the art museum there is a big screen where they project the movie.&nbsp; You have to bring your own chairs, blankets and stuff of that manner to sit on, and over priced popcorn was for sale but I suggest bringing your own.&nbsp; It's much like a drive in except for the car part, as Jess put it.&nbsp; It was a very enjoyable evening.     &nbsp;   Today I had a minor melt down about the Granny situation.&nbsp; Not that it's been extremely hard having her here, it's just that I don't exactly handle stress in the best of ways.&nbsp; So like the loser I am, I had to cancel on the girls this morning.&nbsp; I called Annie mid-melt down and she made me feel better, like the awesome friend that she is.&nbsp; I felt horrible that I was canceling ,but it was for the best I suppose and I think everyone understands.&nbsp; So today mom and I finally made my Wizard of Oz blanket....At least the day turned out to be productive.&nbsp; That's about all kids...Later     &nbsp;   Shout out to Jo-Nathan....We had pulled pork for dinner tonight, I know your jealous!

       Life has been somewhat uneventful lately.&nbsp; And I for one have been going stir crazy.&nbsp; The highlight of my day yesterday was getting the Wagoner back...ole woody.&nbsp; I've been told that my car's name could be taken in quite the crude manner, but I must assure you that&nbsp;naming my car&nbsp;woody was in complete ingnorance to it's duel meaning.&nbsp; I was thinking of the cheerful Disney/Pixar flick Toy Story, not slang for an excited male part...Good thing we cleared that up.&nbsp; But I shouldn't say that getting woody was the highlight, o no, I had the pleasure of viewing one and a half hours of country music with my grandmother.&nbsp; Yes sir that was some fun...Being the  huge  country fan that I am...And not only did we watch the Country Music Festival, we played rummy (hmm perhaps&nbsp;I spelled that wrong) my grannies favorite card game.&nbsp; I mean if that's not the highlight of anyone's day than what the hell is?     &nbsp;    Today was slightly more interseting, slightly is the key word.&nbsp; I woke up late, it's begining to become a habit, and had brunch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then ma and I went out to do some errands, buy stamps, pick up my last summer reading book, return some stuff at the mall, fun stuff like that.&nbsp; I&nbsp;saw the sneakers I want,&nbsp;lilac and gray new balances...$39.99 at&nbsp;Journeys...But sadly&nbsp;I didn't purchase them.&nbsp; After the mall, my Dad asked if I would be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;go to a movie...I guess&nbsp;my stir craziness was evident&nbsp;to all members of my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to see Anchorman&nbsp;at the Raleigh Grande.&nbsp; Wow it's been awhile since I visited that place...Remember&nbsp;when it first opened and it was such a big deal that it had stadium seating?&nbsp; Yeah not so hopping any more but still an enjoyable movie viewing facility none the less.&nbsp; Anchorman was hilarious in that Will Ferrell, stupid, crude, funny way.&nbsp; Some&nbsp;of my favorite lines/scenes included...."Take me to pleasure land"...."I freaking love you....I freaking love you too"...."Your like a mini Buddha with fur"....Ben Stiller with a Spanish accent....Will Ferrell in the phone booth..."60% of the time it works all the time...That doesn't make any sense"...Random outake from another movie at the end.&nbsp; I would give it two thumbs up, if your looking to laugh.&nbsp; Perhaps don't see it with your Father though,&nbsp; somewhat uncomfortable.&nbsp; After the movie we picked up Chinese food and brought it home.&nbsp; I drove, which was good pratice and such.&nbsp; And&nbsp;I must report that my dad only yelled once...yes once...and made that air sucking in sound only twice!&nbsp; So I'd say it was a successful trip!&nbsp; Alright well that's about all from me kids!&nbsp;&nbsp; later &nbsp;

      Annie came over last night.  We made salmon for dinner...Well actually I made salmon and Annie watched, but that doesn't really matter.  After dinner we watched The Missing.  It had Raleigh's own Evan Rachel Wood, Tommy Lee Jones, and that girl from The Lord Of the Rings.  It was a good movie, not really my type though.  Thin plot line, Indians, gory violence...Really I enjoy a good romantic comedy and this movie was neither romantic nor a comedy.  And there was voo doo involved in this film, which is just creepy.  I mean who invented voo doo?  Some sick loser that's who...Alright so I didn't really like the movie.     The next morning Annie and I showered, not together granted, and we thought we'd head to the Flea Market but no luck.  We got a later start than expected, so we just headed over to pick up Jeannine aka J9 to go see Harry Potter in the Imax.  My dad had to drive us because of that stupid one passenger per car rule, which by the way is never enforced ,but because we are law abiding citizens we didn't break the rules.  I drove...Big mistake.  I though it'd be good to practice driving in the city.  Hmmm yeah it would have been good if I wasn't driving my dad's freaking truck which, as Pamela put it, is a monster that could swallow me whole.  But we made it to the Imax theater in one piece, thankfully, only to find out it was sold out...grrr.  Change of plans...We headed over to crossroads to see Sherk 2.  It was a good plan until we realized we were so hungry.  Change of plans once again.  We grabbed lunch at Ruby Tuesdays.  It was great, I had soup and salad...Annie had a Chicken sandwich wrap, which was an interesting thing to figure out how to eat, and J9 had a burger.  After lunch we walked over to Old Navy, ooh big summer sale!  So all worked out great.  Granny is moving in tomorrow.  And I seemed to have gotten saddled with waiting for the man who delivers my Grandma's oxygen.  I hope he's a nice man...he must be though...If he usually delivers things to old ladies.  I don't really mind waiting though, anything for family right? Sure...Any who I'm off to iron my new orange lien skirt...It's so hot...That I got at old navy today!  Later

      Last night sucked. I couldn't fall asleep, I was suffering from home alone syndrome.  And in reality I wasn't entirely home alone.  Sean came home around tenish ,but for some reason his presence isn't my idea of comfort.  Not that I doubt he could take down an unsuspected intruder if presented with the challenge. It's just that he came home, collapsed on his bed and slipped into a  state of sleep just sort of a comma.  If something did happen would he even hear me scream?  My parents came home around 2:00, yes 2:00.  It's sad that my parentals had a crazier night than I did.  I finally fell asleep after their arrival and didn't wake up until almost noon.  I hate sleeping in, it makes me feel like I've wasted the entire morning.  When you wake up at noon you've already missed so much; breakfast, quality daytime TV like Ellen. It's like you missed a portion of the day and all you have left is afternoon and evening.  And even still at noon my mom had to wake me, the family was going out to eat.  We went to Cracker Barrel.  I had blueberry pancakes and hot tea.  After breakfast/lunch we went inside the outlet mall next door.  It was a ghost town, and for good reason.  There wasn't even a Gap outlet, Gasp.  So, little time was spent outlet shopping.  Mom and I fully intended to run out to BJ's and the bookstore but she is currently napping on the couch...Again wasted time on sleeping.  While she slumbered I started reading The Accidental Tourist.  It's quite good.  It starts right off the bat with a divorce and a death.  And the main character Macon reminds me of myself...If I was a man who was forced to live with only his dog and cat as company that is.  Macon has a system for everything, he is obsessively clean, and constantly on a schedule.  Hopefully I'll never be forced into a situation where I find myself becoming so organized...Although I could see myself there.  Hopefully I'll enjoy the book in it's entirety.  If not I still have Short Stories by Great American Women, sounds like fun!  Later

      This morning was quite uneventful.  Mom and Dad went down to Grannies but I decided to sit the trip out.  Instead I ate a late breakfast, did a little workout, went in the pool, and did some laundry.  Fun stuff indeed.  Then after that exictment I talked to Natalia.  That crazy chick and I decided it's about time we hang out so in true eirn/nati fashion we decided to do something random....No not the usual free live music or art museum we went to paint pots at amazing glaze.  Natalia painted a Beer mug, because she drinks so much booze, and I painted an african violet pot.  We seriously thought about painting an herb garden set...to you know grow herbs....but the above mentioned pieces won out.  Nati painted her mug, that by the way will be heavily used for the consumption of beer, in a turtle, fish, frog theme....It was hmm how do i say it?  Interesting!  I funckified my pot with random purple and green shapes and such. I don't mean to toot my own horn, but "toot toot" it's a hot pot!  My parents are off getting their rock on at the Chicago/Earth Wind and Fire concert.  Jealous I know, and I'd be there too but it's an adult thing...And plus I wasn't in the mood.  I'm actually really freaking tired and hey there's this really great cure for being tired called sleeping and I'm off to do just that! Later

      My Grandma has to move in with my family....Crazy stuff.  My mom's cousin has been living with her, but now she's leaving so we're turning our dining room into a nursing home.  I know that it will be totally fine and it'll all work out but it'll be one more stress.  It's been weird watching my grandma get old.  It's sort of like in life we all go in a circle, and when you get old your back at the begging of your circle.  You have to depend on someone else for everything, you can't feed yourself or wash yourself, you can't walk....It sucks to get old and it sucks that your kids have to be your babysitter.  I guess it's kind of like a sick pay back, your parents take care of you when your a baby and then the kids take care of their parents when they are senile.   Well any way the whole living arrangement will take some getting used to seeing as the dining room is the freakin center of the house.  It'll be fine though.  Ma and I did mad crazy errands today.  And drum roll please.........I got my ears pierced!   I'm glad I did it.  After that we shopped the mall, and I spent some B-Day money. We stopped by our neighrborhood grocer, Harris Teeter and spent our 40 bucks.  We are now one week closer to a free aero bed....My mom gets sucked in every time!  After that exciting trip we picked up some of the DISNEY PICTURES!   grr I miss Disney....In particular I miss a certain fab four...Even more specifically I miss a certain member of the fab four who happens to share my name......Sometimes I wonder if I still lived in Florida how different my life would be.  I mean I might be a totally different person, with totally different friends and hobbies and I'd be more tan!  I wonder if I would still be living in Deerfield...Probably not.  But even if I lived in Florida things would be still be long distance for the fab four....Well I'd probably live near Jo-Nathan but....The rest of the gang would still be far away....Grrr I'm getting myself into a nostaglic mood...Like a freaking "what if" session.....I guess I should screw "what if" and just be happy with the present....Wow wasn't that deep!  Alright well that's just about enough for me kids....Later ERIN

      Sweet 16 today, it sure doesn't feel like the milestone it's made out to be.  Perhaps it's because I won't be getting my license until after Thanksgiving.  Or maybe it's because today has been rather uneventful, which is okay seeing as we just got back from vacation and such.  This morning, well really early afternoon, Ma and me went down to Granny's (should that be spelled with an "ies" not a "y"?)  We gave her and Joyce there souvenirs and told them about the trip and all that jazz.  Then we had lunch and did the cake and cards thing for my Birthday.  Then the real excitement started, the man who cleans my grandma's oxygen machine came.  I know all of you wish you had been there, since it was so much fun.  Well and then after all that commotion, Granny had to take a nap so we hit the road and now I'm home.  The folks and I are going out to the Duck and Dumpling tonight to celebrate this grand occasion that is 16! OH and later this week I'm getting my ears pierced, since according to Jo-Nathan I'm the only girl he knows that doesn't have them pierced.  And god knows if everyone else is doing it than I better freaking get on the bandwagon.  Alright that's pretty much all...Later kids!

      O It's back to reality, seeing as I'm back from my wonderful vacation.  Disney was, as always, marvelous.  We also visited Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure, both much better than I expected.  The weather was hot, that's why they call it the sunshine state, but for most part pleasant.  Well I could gush for pages about how awesome the trip was but I won't, just want to give some shout outs to the "fab four"...it has an awesome time!  Remember these......."Manana Manana" * "Hey Giirrrll!" * "I'll do it and I'll do it with a smile." * "Lets just take our time" * "Bee-ah" * sand in your pants * "Keep your genes in your pants" * "What do you want me to say?" * Tears on splash mountain * chickening out on the mummy * bus hopping * people talking to us in line (going dancing) * LON (large opening navel?) * SS * stickers from skip * stepping on Aaron's flip flops * Fa you! * gray squirrels make good decisions * screw you! * No screaming on the Haunted Mansion * WAKE ME UP! * Hee Hee * Jo-Nathan * marsupial * Patchwork * K * beautiful...I just want you to know * walks till 1:30 * Automagicaly * my newsies hat * The word game * make love....no no sandwiches * Aaron the supervisor * "come come do what you want to" * kimps and tounges * "Hi ya pal!" * Kiddie Kone * pal Mickey * Free Dole whips * "I feel so Free" * Pizza planet * shower with no door * A my name is Alice * Tower of Terror pictures * brum chica brum bum (porn music) * the bend and snap with peter pan......so many more...what a trip!  The fab four...then the terrific three...to the tiny two....now it's just uno sucko!    How many days till' New Years?    Later Kids!

      Day two at Raleigh Charter. I wore comfortable shoes and was well prepared with my spanking new Swiss gear backpack...It's rather rugged, but it suits my needs. Last night I experienced once again the joys of homework...I started with algebra II at 4:00 and didn't finish up with Ethan Frome until about 9:45. I did go school supply shopping for about an hour inbetween though. The workload is one of the biggest changes at RCHS. At Athens homework was rarely assigned and even less frequently taken seriously. Besides the work load, Raleigh Charter isn't lacking in the change department. There are no bells, no cafeteria, way smaller population, the annoucments sound like the bells on Grease....but change is good I suppose. At Athens I could live in my little cocoon of security. I was surrounded by familiar faces, recognizable teachers, the same blah atmosphere was in every single classroom...it was just easier. At RCHS I'm still the new girl...I don't know everyone's faces, I don't know who's a bitch, or what guys are jerks; I don't know who so and so hung out with last year, or who jake or tim or bob took to prom. It's all so unfamiliar and for the first time in my life I'm completely out of my element. Well not completely...Because I easily can invasion RCHS as my element...It will just take time I'm sure. And really, who wants to live in a cocoon?  The very first Musical Theater club meeting, founded by yours truly, is Thursday August 19th at 2:45 in Mrs. Rasnicks room. I'm so excited to finally get it off the ground. Friday is a clubs fair and I'll have a booth, and Kevin Ferguson is coming on Thursday, I've typed up an info sheet...it's just crazy that it's actually shaping up. Not like i doubted it would, I just can't believe it's already starting!  I suppose I should go start on tonight's abundance of homework, wish me luck! LATER

      My first mistake was to wear kitten heels on the first day of school. The second was carrying , as Tom Martin would say,a trendy tote bag instead of opting for the traditional book bag. Other than the above mentioned wardrobe malfunctions, my first day at RCHS went fairly smooth. It's not to say that the kitten heels and tote were a complete bust though, they did complete my ensemble nicely. I didn't get lost once, although it is pretty hard to do since the school is not too hard to navigate. I enjoy all of my teachers as of right now, don't quote me on this a few weeks down the road when I'm stressing about papers and test and such. But they all seem fairly pleasant and certainty more combatant than anyone I'd ever met over at the Drive. Annie and I have one class together, Advanced US History. And soon after that is lunch so I see her throughout the day. Today we ate lunch with Tom, Angus, and Kirsten out in the courtyard in the grass. It was quite different than the usual cafeteria atmosphere, a nice change though. And Annie's car didn't get towed, we're getting pretty good at this city parking thing! I'm off now to start homework, and to purchase some school supplies I failed to get in my pre-school prep. Later!

      I've had quite the busy week I must say.  Annie and I have visted RCHS several times in hopes of mastering the perfect morning route.  We've decided to take Lake Wheeler to capital and exit onto Peace Street.   On Wednesday night we rented Thriteen, and ran into Kirsten at Blockbuster.  The movie was good, and seeing Kirstens new haircut was an added bonus : )  It's disturbing the stupid stuff that kids do to be "cool".  My previous comment was about the movie not kirstens new doo!  Evan Rachel Wood gave an impressive performance and it's refreshing to see a young women in Hollywood making career choices that don't involve sluty clothes or the Disney Channel, although I'm sure Ms. Wood could pull off both.   Annie helped me write an outline for musical theater club Wednesday night as well.  It really helped me put together all my crazy ideas before out meeting with Maggie, which is what we woke up at 8:00 the next morning for.  The meeting went well, It's so awesome to be at a school that has a supportive drama teacher.  I think that musical theater at RCHS will take off splendidly!  I just have to "get my shit together" as a certain someone would say...!   After the meeting we went to Old Navy and spent money unessacaryly....at least I did.  Well I didn't like splurge on something obber expensive I just must now take a vow.....no more shopping.  Speaking of no more shopping....Friday morning Jeannine's mom drove the ladies up to triangle town center.  Just what I needed this summer, another trip to the mall.  I didn't spend tooooo terriably much though so all's well!  After tripping on the carpet a few times, leaving things in selected dressing rooms, and pissing off the ice cream lady we drove home.  Jeannine gave me a birthday present.....the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, a Honk! college, and a head wrap!   Thanks a bunch you African!   This morning Mom, Dad, and myself all slemped down to grannies.  Fun stuff......not really but the weather was so nice and the drive went really well so I suppose it wasn't a compelte waste of time.   hrmmph....o welll, soon she'll move back in i'm sure and then we won't have to drive an hour and  a half just to say hello.    Thats all for me kids,   i apologize for any spelling mistakes, i don't have time for spell check....the girls are coming over for pizza and a Dirty Dancing marathon......what a way to end the summer!  later

      Summer is slowly coming to an end. I feel like it's already over, and I'm just living in eternal weekend. Mom and Dad are back at work, and so is Sean so mostly I get to be lazy all day, if I can't bum a ride off of one of my fabulous friends who drive. Even though I know summer is ending it's still unreal that next week I'll be driving to school....A new school no less. I don't think it will sink in until August 9th.  Annie came home last night from Maine. yay! Today we got an early start...10:00 to be exact, and headed to Cary to do some errands. Joanne's, Kohls, etc....And we had lunch at Panera. Annie had a smoked turkey sandwich and I enjoyed broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl. I think my exact words were "it's cozy" hehe. It was great to catch up and to hear all about her vacation and family and such. Then Annie had to jet off to work, hang in there kiddio, and I was once again left at home. I finally got started on my AP English paper, but since I haven't been in a very motivated mood lately I didn't finish it. Mom should be home soon and I've been enlisted to help with dinner. That's all for know....Later
