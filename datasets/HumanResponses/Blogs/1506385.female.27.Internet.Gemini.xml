      Finally! I saw Main Hoon Na :) Pretty decent movie..I thought.  What I liked: The BACKGROUND score (I think its fantastic!), Sushmita Sen and the Action sequences.  What I disliked: The songs (they are pretty badly shot), The editing (Its so unfinished & shabby)  The Worst: Suniel Shetty's character!

      Haven't seen a bollywood flick in 2 weeks! The last I saw was Masti. I'll try and watch MHN this weekend. I have heard its quiet a SOB. Khichdi of all the recent bollywood hits & the hot toppic of Indo-Pak relationship.  I've also heard the only saving grace in the movie is Sushmita Sen. Heard she looks ravishing in MHN.  The songs of MHN are strictly OK. Anu Malik has done an average job. The last time he worked hard was Asoka..i think. Asoka had some great songs!  The last SRK flick i saw was KHNH. Ammm.. yet another addition to my favourites list. Not because of SRK but the songs & the picturization.  I think nobody has ever shot NYC like this before...

      Lakshya. Do I have one? No. Not yet. I like the scene in LAKSHYA when Hrithik, has no words to describe his lakshya... which is to drive away the enemy.  Had been to Leh-Ladakh last week. I had never seen India like this before. I mean I have seen alot of hill stations but this one is the most different one. Its a cold desert.  I went to a village called Alchi, about 100 kms away from Kargil. 1000 years old monastry, harsh sun, Chilly breeze, mountains all over, no vegetation and the very beautiful Indus river.   A normal human being takes about 24 hrs to get aclimatised. Its very difficult to breathe there. One has to get used to the weather there. Now I wondor..  I have seen LOC-KARGIL, saw LAKSHYA yesterday. I only know about Kargil whats been shown in these movies...must have been more worse. I mean..I couldn't walk 100 mtrs without being breathless, i wondor how these brave soldiers climed the hills! Its amazing!

       BHOOOOOOOOOOT!!   Today is Kersasp's Birthday and its been exactly ONE year since I saw Bhoot starring Urmila, Ajay and Fardeen Khan. I remember, I, Kersasp, Carie, Anand, Rishi, Ritesh and Bhavna had gone to watch the movie. And this is what happened to some of us. (There were some who just didn't get affected by the movie)  Me - I didn't get sleep for 2 months! Everytime I would try to sleep, I would imagine Manjeet (The ghost in 'Bhoot') watching me from the bedroom door. I avoided looking into the mirror at night for almost a month. I do it sometimes even now :(!! The feeling of someone watching you..or someone being around was with me for a very long time. I used to wake up in the middle of the night because of the nightmares I had of that same ghost.  After a year, that feeling is still there....sometimes, when I am alone. I hate being alone and that too at night!   Anand - Apparantly he stayed very close to the building where Bhoot was shot! And he lived all alone in a 2 bedroom house. He kept the lights on at night for almost a month. He dismantled his keyboard thinking someone would start playing it at night. He didn't get off his bed at night thinking there would be someone below it.  He thought he got spam mails from Manjeet (the ghost in the movie).  Rishi- He had seen the movie with his eyes closed! Don't know still how he was as scared as I was! He slept with his parents that day!
