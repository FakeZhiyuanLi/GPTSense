      It late on Saturday night and all is quiet on the home front here in Dominica. I hope you guys are all celebrating the end of the school year and the official start of summer. Only a few more days till South Carolina and some summertime memories.   Theresa- hope you and Sue are having a great time at girls weekend/baby shower.   Things are a little stressful here in Dominica. Short story- Jason ran into some obstacles regarding the construction of a community boat ramp. The snafu kind of soured his confidence on some other future construction projects.  The weather is also crummy, heavy rains and strong wind, resulting in mud, mud, mud and more mud.   However, the good news is that it looks like Jason may have found and sealed the deal on a building for "4 Dominica's" retail location. That process was a pain in the ass. In Dominica when someone wants to sell/rent/ or lease a property they don't submit an asking or list price. The burden is on the buyer/renter/or lessee to submit an offer. There are no records of property sales or real estate values to base your offer and when more than one party is interested it is like a silent auction. Weather is also expected to improve June 1st. Knowing that the rain will stop and the sun is around the corner makes the rain and its effects a little more tolerable.  Since I have arrived I have made myself "mother to all animals." One of the puppies (born last Nov) is only 1/4th the size of his brother and looks malnourished. Needless to say I was upset. The vet is coming up to check all the animals and fix two of them. The little pup had so many fleas and ticks it was ridiculous. I gave him a does of Frontline and that failed to make a dent. Today, I gave him a flea/tick bath and noticed a slight improvement, and carefully remove the rest one by one. I pulled around thirty or more and Burned them with a lighter. YUCK! YUCK! YUCK!!! I have never been so grossed out as I was today. I think the little pup feels better. I have been feeding him chicken and rice and all things nice and have noticed a size change. Oh and yes even though I was careful I had Jason check me over completely. Partly because I was so grossed out and paranoid.  Okay enough of that gross stuff. I'm never going to be able to sleep. I am babbling on and on and on... I will be surprised if anyone is even still reading this blog as a part of me has even started to wonder. Okay I'm signing off. I'll blog more exciting and shorter news next time.:")

      CL- Sunday sounds perfect. I can think of no better way to spend my Sunday morning than talking with good fiends sipping a cup of fine coffee. Suggestions on places? If we are eating I suggest McGregor Cafe or First Crotch. If it is just for Coffee we could meet at Sweet Bean, Black Hawk, or B&N. I'm open to suggestions, decisions, or fresh ideas, just count me in.

      It's  a monday! The upstairs units shower is leaking and I have three large water rings on my ceiling.   How was everyone’s weekend? Sissy, how was dinner with Scott? Theresa what did you do? Courtney, did you bake anything?  Nicole's birthday celebration was nice and peaceful. We spent the day at the Outrigger, toasted the sunset with a glass of champagne, and closed with a nice tapas dinner all on the beach.   This week I will be preparing to leave for Dominica. I leave on the next Tuesday on the 25th.  I am looking forward to being there, but not the plane ride. During the summer the flights are more turbulent in the Caribbean. Yuck!  What are ya’ll doing this weekend?

      Hey there girls!   Well Jason is now in Dominica. I took him to the Miami airport (YUCK!)on Monday morning.

I like this Blogger thing it is both convenient and fun.  Hope everyone is doing well and is blogging....  Spell check doesn't recognize Blogger.

      It's Monday night and my bags are packed. Jason and I are at the main house eating steamed shrimp and watching Hockey. What a game!  I think I will have everything I need for the trip. I hope we do some shopping. I will need to get something to wear for the evenings. Maybe some shoes.  Well until Wednesday/Thursday, Jen

      I can't think of anything in addition to fruit and water. I'll try and burn a couple of CD's. I have been reminiscing about my experience in Charleston, figs, the old Banana Rep style, basket weavers, rainbow row, hot nights, the smell of rose and tasty treats everywhere. I think we are all going to have a much enjoyed time.   I agree it would be nice to take an annual girls trip to various places. Maybe we could go to New Orleans and Theresa could show us a little Cajun cooking. I like the idea and look forward to future discussion.   CL- I will send you directions to Susan's or Grandaddy's place. What time are you and Sissy planning on leaving Fort Myers? 's   Tell Sissy I said hello and I wish she a computer.   What book did you guy's decide on? Did someone have a better idea?  I have to go, but I'll type more later today.

      This day next week we will be on the road to Charleston, South Carolina. The city that gave birth to the meaning " southern charm and hospitality ." Theresa you will be excitedly packing and making the final arrangements for your departure the following day. I predict that you will be held up through out the day/evening with a series of well intended,but annoying phone calls.   This feels like such an adventure, I can't wait. I'm so excited, YA-YA

      Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim: Essays David Sedaris    From the Publisher    David Sedaris returns to his deliriously twisted domain: hilarious childhood dramas infused with melancholy; the gulf of misunderstanding that exists between people of different nations or members of the same family; and the poignant divide between one's best hopes and most common deeds. The family characters his readers love are all here, as well as the unique terrain they inhabit, strewn with comic landmines.  "The Rooster" is back, and getting married in the funniest wedding ever described.   David attends a slumber party and gets the upper hand in a unique version of strip poker.   "Rubber or plastic?" The strangest questions can tear people apart.   A skinny guy from Spain, wearing a bishop's hat and accompanied by six to eight men, invades your house and pretends to kick you. Is this any way to spend Christmas?   With this new book, Sedaris's prose reaches breathtaking new heights and marks off a territory that is unmistakably his own. Read it and weep tears of humane laughter.    The Stepford Wives  Ira Levin, Peter Straub  From the Publisher    "For Joanna, her husband, Walter, and their children, the move to beautiful Stepford seems almost too good to be true. For behind the town's idyllic facade lies a terrible secret - a secret so shattering that no one who encounters it will ever be the same." At once a masterpiece of psychological suspense and a commentary on a media-driven society that values the pursuit of youth and beauty at all costs, The Stepford Wives is a novel so frightening in its final implications that the title itself has earned a place in the American lexicon.

      Glad to hear you gals had such a great time. I know getting together with good friends can be a spiritual energy renewal. I know I am certainly looking forward to our time in Charleston.   There are two puppies and Jason I named them Puce (Flea in French) and Boots. Puce is all white and had all the problems. Boots is his brother and has black ears and a few blk spots. Farm life for animals is so different than domesticated animals. I am still adapting and learning the balance.   This weekend was filled with work, work, work! Monday was a religious holiday in the Caribbean. Jason and I installed a new more powerful water pump, finished the construction of the closet, and organized the storage/tool shed. Next week we are installing the wood panel ceiling for the outside open bays (soon to be our porch/living areas). But, tomorrow Jason is taking me to Scottshead for a little fun in the sun and snorkeling. He feels bad because we have been working everyday and haven't done anything fun.   It is always an adjustment when I come here. I guess it's kinda like going to the river.   CL-I received your phone message about the air mattress. We'll do an exchange when I get back.   I'll post again tomorrow. Jen

       Hey it's me. I have a new computer and am so excited about it! I feel like I can do so many things now that I'm able to access the internet from home. Anyway. Just trying this out and I swear do any of you use this blog anymore? It doesn't look like it. I am not good at this yet but will be.    Is anyone finished with the book yet? I haven't started it yet and Theresa I know you said you were almost finished with it. Do me a favor and write back with your email addresses only because I have them all stored at school or better yet. Court, could you send me that file with all of them on there or did I make that? Anyway, write back peeps!
