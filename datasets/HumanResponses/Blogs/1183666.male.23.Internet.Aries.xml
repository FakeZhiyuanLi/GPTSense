Keep in mind that this dude has a wife and kid.  He said she was a good kisser though.   #04 - waking up at 10:30 the next day because he was too hung over. #05 - getting to Flin Flon, only to find that we didn't have the proper keys to get into the store we had to pack up.  So we went for lunch, then bowling, which was "on me" for some strange reason.   #06 - Supper that night, me ordering an appetizer platter, $9.00.  He ordered a $18.00 steak dinner with two beers.   #07 - Same night, he went to play slots and i slept.  He came back and "accidently" ordered not ONE, but TWO PORNOS while i'm trying to get some sleep.  He was making some weird noises.  I was pretending to sleep because i was affraid he'd jump in bed with me.  At least he had the courtousy to go to the bathroom to take care of his business, twice.  Finally getting to sleep at 2:00 a.m.   #08 - Staying in some dump in Swan River.  He went to the "rippers", i stayed and phoned civillized people.  He came back a little later with 18 Buds, expecting me to drink with him.  I had the beer he cracked open for me, before he told me that he met some chick in the bathroom at the bar, he started making out with her, gropped her "tit" and then put his hand down her pants.  He left to meet this chick again, I ran to the bathroom dumped the beer down the drain and washed my face from possible contamination from his encounter with some drunk "chunky" chick.   #09 - After that, he said that she was going to come back to the room with him and they'd do it.  He said i could watch, OR join in.  I was actually hoping that would happen so i could get my own room.  #10 - He then told me not to tell my dad about some stuff while he "playfully" said that if i did, he'd kill me.  All in all, a trip i'll never forget.

						    Top 8 Reasons Working on Princess Ave. is da bomb   1.   The Fountain   - need I say more? Home of the White Trash Swim Team, and the most staggering urine to water ratio on the face of the Earth. 2.   Father Guido   and the 2-litre beer drinkers - what was once a common spectacle, but since we phoned the cops complaining, our entertainment has been on a steady decline. :( 3.   The dude   with bitch tits - now a regular character who walks down Princess with the most massive breasts I have ever witnessed on a human being. 4.   John Garcia/David Crosby   look alike - this dude is a dead ringer for the long lost Garcia/Crosby love child. Makes me think, "if only Melissa Etheridge knew about this dead sexy man, she could have some supreme old timer rockstar sperm to impregnate her". 5.   Hibernation Man   - the dude JohnnyO-666, KennyO-666 and I witnessed after band practice. It was like he just woke up from a glorious slumber to find that the world had changed.  Was last seen heading straight for the fountain.  DUN DUN DUNNNNNNN. 6.   One Armed Push-ups   by a dude in a wheelchair - this dude was workin' it!!! When I'm confined to a wheelchair, all I'm doing is one armed push ups. I've seen the light. 7.   Various crazies   who pick up Ken's cigarette butts - usually the same gang of Princess crazies. 8.   The dude with a ferret -   some dude had a ferret, and it needed water. So he came to ATC to give it a drink. He took the ferret back to the park to frolic. Then it tried to make a getaway, so the dude walked over to it and kicked it 3 feet in the air. Then after this display of machismo, he somehow attracted chicks like no other man on the face of the earth.
