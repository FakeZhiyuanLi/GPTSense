      It's a few minutes before 5 p.m. and I'm taking a break from cleaning. Jeff and I spent all day Sunday cleaning the wasteland that was once our apartment. I still can't believe I can acquire so much paper. I bowed my head for a moment of silence to honor the trees who died so that I can be inundated with credit card offers.  Jeff's working until 8 tonight, so I have some free time to let my mind wander ... I didn't  really  want to clean, but Jeff started on this cleaning rampage and I got sucked into it. It needed to be done. I started by sifting through the piles of junk mail and other paperwork I neglected throughout the year, opening each envelope and tearing up the myriad offers for insurance, credit cards, prescription pills... . Occasionally  I would run across an alumni letter from BU or bill with an old address of mine (yes I know I should clean more often). Then my mind travels back to that time; it's strange how inanimate objects do that. Anyway, my mind gets flooded with memories of walking along the Charles River, riding the T, hopping from party to party or bar to bar with Karin and the gang, smelling the crisp burning scent of winter while racing from class to class. Or I'll think about joyriding with the gang in Florida, hanging out at the Mudhouse sipping on a Jamaican shake or goofing off at the beach at night. Then I'd glance over at Jeff and think about our camping trips in some secluded desert outside Phoenix, the toy store or hanging out on Mill Avenue with Sue and Jaime (spelling?). You all get the picture, I've lived in too many places and my memory is too good because I never damaged it with drugs. It's times like these I can't stand, not because I get all nostalgic, but because I wonder, what am I doing now? I feel like for the past three years my job has consumed me. I've had no time to enjoy Virginia or my limited free time. I feel isolated, just like I did just about everywhere else I've lived. That's what gets me down; I remember the isolation and exhaustion. And cleaning just exacerbates those memories. Plus, where will I be when Jeff moves back to Arizona in August? What's in store for me? Will I be stuck here or will I find a better life for myself? Memories and uncertainty don't mix. I guess that's why I snapped at Jeff last night when he attempted to put my sweaters away in an old moldy box. I feel bad, but when I think about it, what on Earth was he thinking with that box? Oh well, we patched things up after he came home from a walk and a stop at the restaurant where he works. But I'm left with an eerie feeling every time I walk into a freshly cleaned room. The more packed boxes and swept floors I see, the more I think about what happens after Aug. 27 (when Jeff leaves). How will I be when I say goodbye to him at the airport in Raleigh? What will the drive home be like? And what's in store for me when I return to the daily grind that following Monday? I guess I'll just have to shut that part of my mind off and enjoy each day, and when the time comes to say goodbye, I'll do just that and take each subsequent day by day. That's all any of us can do. Back to the cleaning: some of you will be very impressed to know that I actually did three loads of laundry today  and  put my clean clothes away. Look out Martha Stewart, a new domestic diva is coming your way. OK, maybe not, but you can't blame a girl for trying.

      My friend, Jane wrote this. Contrary to what her self-loathing high school English teacher told her, the girl can write. I've read her stuff and often wondered why she never pursued a writing career. Oh that's right, architecture pays more.   Now, I present to you, "Intern Almighty" by Jane L. Decker.  Genesis  Imagine a child who for the first time may be realizing that a world lives and breathes around her. Imagine the infant mind wandering and pondering. Her pubescent intellect exists in an untouched world with no boundaries or limitations. Theologically, she is closer to the Light.     She’s got the whole world… in her hands…   she’s got the whole wide world… in her hands…      Sing along now.      Where along life's path does she become consciously and tectonically aware of what her purpose is here on this planet?     Minutes, days, years. The vision, while not muddy necessarily to begin with, becomes clear at twenty-six.      I, an intern architect, am going to build the world!      Profundity is not my main objective but you have just now put index finger to chin and offered a “Hmm,” to your psyche’s astute audience. Your first instinct might be, “Oh no, I’m going to let a 26-year-old newbie build the world?! A girl, no less!”      Your second thought flashed an image of the second-year resident, likely J.D. from “Scrubs”, at West Regional about to perform his very first appendectomy. Both selections offer trained individuals with roughly the same type and quality of education. Do you build the house? Remove the appendix?     I am neither going to build the next Taj Mahal or going to perform any type of serious surgery. I am, however, about to embark on one extraordinarily wild ride; a voyage where I will discover theories in children’s environments and playspaces, in senior citizens and their special needs, and perhaps even explanations of astrotechnological ecosystems and their specific considerations. And that all might be in one day from one issue of Architectural Record.     I didn't set out for this inflated egotistical approach to my profession; you asked the question and I have been thrust into some megalomaniacal haze of superiority.      I am going to build the world. The sentence shifts from declarative to interrogative simultaneously.     I am not going to literally start from scratch mixing equal parts of magma, soil and such, blend well and bake at 450,000 degrees for a few million years, but I am going to participate in an activity that quintessentially defines the human spirit.      We all experience “architecture” everyday. But have you ever realized how all of that happens and exists round you? I am not going to give a tour of the Building Department at the City of Miami. There is not a pair of scissors large-enough to cut through that much red tape in this very short essay. Conversely, a brief jaunt through Process City is necessary.     The architecture world and all of those acronyms you spend your first year learning, have deemed it necessary to not only entertain an extra year of training at the collegiate level to obtain the overly ostentatious 5-year First-Professional Bachelor Degree of Architecture but students must also follow a rigorous developmental path disguised as interning before even beginning to sit for nine, seemingly innocuous licensing exams.      It does’t stop there. With B.Arch in hand, the graduate could traverse the universe garnering experience in every notable field from philosophy to education to engineering and development, but it is interning which leads to the Grand Fork- a place where Opportunity stands with tour book in one hand and binoculars clenched tightly in the other looking ahead.      I should try to assuage you and tell you that at that juncture we all idolize the same great myth and we all seek “good” design. However, the profession remains subjective and the source for our inspiration varies. I may see Richardson, Meier, and Pi in an entirely different light than you or the common man. The common thread lay in our hopes and our dreams and eventually in the exploitation of our services as a whole all in great interest that one fateful day, the public will look up at an edifice and proclaim, “Damn! That’s good architecture.”       Acceptance is a modest commodity in the architecture world. Humble people that we are, we all look forward, perhaps secretly, to being recognized and having our work qualitatively acknowledged. Reaching that point though takes a certain finesse- almost an education in how to train you client. Victoria Beach brought up a point in her piece that compliments this though- “…shouldn’t licensed architects be ethically compelled to use their client’s project to serve architecture, while clients under their care assume similar obligations?” 2     This poignant remark does two things. First, it is correct to metaphorically compare our service to architecture in such a way that vividly illustrates our servitude and slavery to the field. Ask any architect why they became an architect and they will all reply something to the effect of “because I just had to”. I personally guarantee that none of today’s architects pursued the field for financial reasons.  The second thing that Beach’s statement does is recognize the obligations of the client. The only serious way to extinguish such a need would be to create the Client’s Business Plan for Understanding Architecture. In today’s hip terms, the book would be call “Architecture for Dummies”.     Lamentations   Architecture is a necessity, not a want. This would hypothesized in Chapter 1 of the above-mentioned book.      Advertisers make fortunes peddling goods to the public that they don’t very well need. A bag of Doritoes®. Chips-A-HoyTM in a travel cup. Facial cream that doubles as oven degreaser. I made that last one up. We do need architecture.  We want good design. If year after year it is possible to come up with feasible strategies for making things you need even more desirable, I say we do it.      The target audience sits-in-wait in front of their televisions waiting to be told what to enjoy, where to go, and what to eat. And by the end of this essay, another SUV will be leased by Steve and Fifi Jenkins and their 2.5 kids.      They already exist. We do not have to search out a market group or a specific demographic. They all live in homes, work in buildings, and worship in temples designed by architects. Architectural history is infinite and as old as time. If this were a movie, the screen would fade into a forced flashback of Neanderthal Man assembling tree limbs and palm fronds into a makeshift shelter.     Our job is easy (lest the rigorous mission of getting into the profession)  and it is complimentary that it has already begun. The only deficiency is in the solution itself. Access. When the Internet evolved into the monster it has become, no one was  capable of seeing the dillusion and the misinformation that could be circulated en masse. WebMD, for instance, affords the luxurious opportunity of armchair diagnoses; Food.com makes instant chefs; and Ebay fosters instant entrepreneurs emerging once again from that ooze we call capitalism to hock items like Grandma’s soup tourine and Uncle Bob’s ’57 Chevy.      Access.      It is admirable to see “Intro to Arch 101” taking place presently at Target®  with Graves' work and now Kohler's latest ad stabs at architecture’s importance: a self-confident man tours his firm boasting his creative achievements, Mr. & Mrs. Jones tagging along and admiring the gallery of work, only to sit down and ask "So, what can I do for you?"  Mrs. Jones swiftly retrieves a faucet from her purse and dryly declares that the architect, "Design a house around this."      It is now the paradoxical evil that exists around architecture. I asked my mom about the Graves items at Target. She plainly replied, “Oh, I don’t bother looking at that stuff.” Is it because she doesn’t understand it? Doesn’t want to pay what they’re asking for it? My goodness, does she not realize it is the offspring of one of the greatest architects of the late 20th century? Again, I implore that the profession and all of its egotistical manifestations are subjective. My colleague believes Graves to be adolescent and unsophisticated.      From our side, it seems that the public has reduced our profession to a blue-collar classless evil. True, it is not everyday that a commission surfaces to resurrect the World Trade Center or restore Piazza San Pietro, so our exposure resides in the shadows. It should be possible to re-educate or re-introduce the public to the influence and absolute necessity of architecture in the ol’ “if you can beat ‘em, join ‘em” routine. Break the rules.      Gropius asserts it best by explaining there not be an “arrogant barrier”1 between craftsmen and artist and the same could prophesize about societal manifestations and the egotistical architect.  Was it even more narcissistic and arrogant that Wright was granted licensure posthumously? That he didn’t dare require the nuisance of a license in order to justify his craft? If we all at some point aspire to achieve one-tenth of Wright, then certainly I am now of the caliber of Frank himself. I’ve passed one test, Pre-Design; proof-positive that at least I stayed awake and paid attention in history class.      There is arrogance and there is modest amongst us. Yes, we’re a conflicted bunch. However un-Roark-ish it might be to follow the proverbial crowd and actually obtain a license and participate within the norm, we must adhere to the established guidelines in order to maintain the integrity of the profession.     I was told not to shout out in class. You were to raise your hand to speak. I was told never to cut in line, use fowl language, and to say “thank you” and “yes, please”.  I was spanked if I misbehaved and did not consider dialing 1-800-96-ABUSE. While we cannot go back and slap Frank on the wrist or form an official  Paddling Board, we can implement and follow-through with the ideals of the profession.        Heaven  Tomorrow's architects will be emerging from another batch of gurgling lava, one more technologically advanced and competent than we have ever seen. Generation Z will do more than the X's and Y's and they will have the responsibility and obligation of obtaining a license, of determining almost literally, Wright from wrong.      You hated it when your parents said it. And now you have succumbed. “When I was kid…” we drew by hand. On drafting tables. With a T-square.  I chuckle that I will tell this same story to my children, in the distant future, and they will gaze back at me awe-inspired by the tools of yesteryear. Tomorrow will emerge faster than we all think and the tools to “do” or “make” architecture are metamorphisizing as we speak.      We secretly ache for those IBM tablet things that you can take anywhere and sketch and draw on in a whim. We imagine, “What would Frank think of this?” We desire the tools to make us swifter, faster, and better so we can keep up with Steve and Fifi.  So, our first task on the presidential platform of Tomorrow’s Architecture should be self-exploratory, discovering what or who or why it is we became what we are.     After that, it will come naturally – the ability to give back to the people a lesson in good architecture.      Beach also says that we should let people, not policy decide when a building has achieved architecture. The dilemma here would then be who is qualified to make that call.  The common man or woman, your neighbor, my mother may not know the difference between the cornice and pedestal, the fenestration or whatever, of a building, yet we should allow them to judge? Yes, but first a mainstream program of inviting knowledge would have to be put forth in order to insure a good review.     Revelations  The appendix is gone and you’ve got that vacant piece of land up in Central Florida. You wonder if I am the greasy, slick-haired salesman who is going to proffer excessive inches of crown-moulding or imbue Feng Shui-style tactics to find your chi.  You hope I have dissected Corbu, analyzed Mies, and memorized Wright. You fancy a cultured and academic, perhaps sterile approach and want me to forcibly feed you “good” architecture. I on the other hand, still swing my garden hat in that idyllic setting filled with pansies dreaming of grand cathedrals, soaring towers, and lush manors wondering if you know what it means to not be licensed and what good architecture truly is.     I hold the power to shape the future of architecture… and “a mixture of passion, hope, fear, concern, and enthusiasm for the profession.”3        He steps off the curb and begins to cross the street. He holds both arms powerfully and defiantly in the air, with a sweeping motion, widening grin and the pop song in the background, he quite matter-of-factly exclaims in tune with the song, “I’ve got the power!”  Jim Carrey in his deity-like role in Bruce Almighty, revels with vigor.  The swell and surge of emotion pulses through my veins… suddenly that childhood song becomes that tectonic reality I was looking for...      I've got the whole world...     And you… The Client? You’ve got an architect that wants to give you the world in a neat and tidy little package called Your Project.

      For those of you new to this blog thing like I am, here's a little help. Instead of clicking on "create a blog," click on the green cross next to random musings called "new post." That way, you can add a comment to my blog and not have to create a blog page of your own, unless you want to.  Sorry I didn't mention it earlier. I clicked on the wrong thing when I originally tried to post something on Carrie's blog.   That being said, I just wanted to let you know that "Calamity Jen" strikes again. It started on Saturday afternoon when I popped a bone out of my left knee socket while playing computer solitaire and ended with me having to go to the doctor for a suspected bug bite I received sometime this morning. Don't ask me how the bone popped out. When it first happened, I lied on my side for a few minutes wondering what just happened and what I should do about it. Should I call 911? No, I already have enough people laughing at me, so I really don't need to add Lynchburg dispatchers and rescue workers to the list. Should I call someone from work? No, because if they're smart, they'd be out of town by now. Should I call Jeff at work? No, he just started his shift at his new job. So there I was, lying down, wondering how it was even possible for me to do such a thing. Being the genius that I am, I sat up and compared the knees and noticed that there was a bump next to my left knee --- my bone. So, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman (yours truly), got the bright idea of popping the bone back into the socket. I was able to walk again, yippee. but after awhile my knee cap and surrounding area became sore. So, Jeff ordered me to wear an old knee brace of his until I bought one of my own. Those things are so uncomfortable, so I refused to wear it today and I'm still sore. But at least I can walk :). Then today, I was just about to pull into the parking lot of my workplace when I noticed my left hand itching. I looked down and noticed a huge red bump between my thumb and index finger and swelling between the knuckles of my index and middle fingers, which restricted my hand movement. When I got into the office, I showed Richard, one of the interns (whose dad is a doctor), my injured hand, making him nearly pass out. His reaction led me to stop by the walk in clinic next door to get it checked out. Of course with any visit to the doctor, my hand just about healed up before it was my time to see the doctor. I had to pay $15 for a doctor to tell me to take a Benadryl. Oh well, better safe than sorry I guess. At least it's not as embarrassing as the time in Boston when I fell down a small set of steps in my apartment building and landed on my knees like I finished some Paula Abdul-esque dance routine. Ask Jason about that one.

      I have no idea what the heck I'm doing, but I've heard that these blog thingies are all the rage with all who or what are cool. I guess I'll use this to vent, or, if in the rare event I might have an interesting thought or witty remark to make, post them. Well, it's past 11 p.m. and my night cops duty is officially over (yeah!) I'm going home. :)

      I realize it's been nearly a month since I last wrote anything. I apologize. Things here have been a little nutty. For those of you in the journalism/media industry, or those of you whom I've talked to in the past couple of weeks, you probably know why things have been a little weird here in the Old Dominion (that's Virginia's nickname). About two weeks ago, one of my editors became "no longer with the company" after people on staff learned he altered electronic copies of stories that were sent to the state newspaper association's contest (Virginia Press Association, which I'll abbreviate to VPA in future references). The stories entered to the contest were different than what was published in the newspaper; quotes were made up, transitions changed, typos were even added. This is a big no-no in journalism, despite what some critics of the trade and other cynics might think. Everyone at the paper was hurt, obviously. The only way I can describe what everyone was feeling was that it felt like church members finding out their pastor cheated on his wife with some chick in the congregation after he gave numerous sermons about how infidelity was wrong. For those of you who grew up in the church like I did, you know exactly what I'm talking about. The newsroom is moving on, reporting and putting out papers, trying to make sense of it all but at the same time not looking back. Many of us feel like a dark cloud has been lifted from the newsroom and we're optimistic that things will get better. Our managing editor has been terrific; he's been open with everybody about what happened and what changes were made and took groups of reporters out to lunch to answer any questions we had. The Washington Post and the Associated Press wrote about the incident and did a great job with their stories. Some are calling how everything came to light divine intervention, and for the most part, I agree with them. But what the Divine wants to do with us now, I couldn't tell you.  Things are starting to calm down now, but it's still a little eerie for me, since I have a clear view of the editor's office from my cubicle. A wooden door now stares me in the face instead of the editor busy on the phone or at the computer, shouting out people's names if he needed to talk to them. The walls have been stripped of the awards he and the newspaper won over the years. The Yankees paraphernalia gone (which for you Mets and Red Sox fans is probably a good thing). In time, that feeling will pass. But it p****s me off that there are people in this industry that I love and have worked to get into since the age of 5 who would destroy the fragile relationship we have with the public just to make themselves look good. I'd rather turn in a 4-inch story with preschool vocabulary and all correct and true information than a 30-inch or more piece laden with lies and fiction. How dare they? Who the @#!* do they think they are? If you want to write fiction, get out of the newsroom and write fiction. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen (pardon the cliche). Most people wouldn't write this much about a job. If you're lucky they might say, "my job sucks" or "my job is good," and that would be it. But for us in this industry, it's not just a job, it's a passion, an obsession. Some of us will go into the newsroom on days off if we have nothing better to do and say hey to whomever is working. If some news breaks, like a storm or accident, we'll come in on our day off if no one else can cover it. We eat, breathe, smoke, drink and live for journalism. Our jobs become our lives. We can't think of doing anything else. Some of you think that's sad and pathetic. Perhaps you're right. But since we have to spend roughly 2,000 hours a year earning money to pay for things we want and need, wouldn't you want to spend that time doing something you love?   That's been my life in a nutshell for the past couple of weeks. I hope to have a more cheerful entry soon. I hope everyone is doing well. God Bless and as Jerry Springer would say (don't you love the irony???) "take care of yourselves and each other."

      Just when you think it can happen to you, it did. I decided to leave work a bit early today (July 12) since I have a long day tomorrow, and when I arrived at my messy apartment everything seemed the same. I had ice cream for dinner (don't judge me) and caught the 6 p.m. news and The Simpsons, not noticing anything different. Captain Oblivious, that's me. Then I went to the bedroom and noticed glass all over the floor. At first I thought it could have been the storm, then quickly realized that no storm could smash a window in a circular motion. I briskly walked through the apartment to check if anything was missing. Jeff's computer, my laptop, the stereo were all in their places. Then I noticed the empty shelf below my TV set, the shelf that once held my DVD player and some DVDs belonging to Jeff. I called the police and they took a report, but I doubt I'll get any of it back. The DVD player cost me $40 and freezes up; the DVDs were free. I'm just glad Jeff and I weren't around. You see, Jeff left for work around 4:30 p.m. and I got home just before 6 p.m. That means the thief only had about an hour and a half to break in, grab whatever he or she wanted and get out. Jeff and I suspect that whoever did this was watching us and taking note of our schedules. Our neighborhood is very quiet and all the neighbors keep to themselves. Plus, our bedroom window is set back from the road and blocked by trees, so no one could really see what is going on. The scary thing is, I was planning on leaving work earlier because of the long hours I have to work tomorrow. I'm glad I waited. The only setback is I won't be able to watch clear, crystal movies on DVDs. I'll have to go back and rent videos for awhile. But I'd rather deal with that inconvenience than be in ICU or a coffin.

      My story has nothing to do with the Anime film. It is a warning for those who still enjoy blowing large bubbles while chomping on one of the most popular confections in our country. This afternoon I was reminded why adults should not blow bubbles while chewing gum. About half the piece stuck to my face after I blew a huge blue bubble while driving in my car. The piece that took away my dignity: Dubble Bubble bubble gum. The cheap, chalky gum you used to get in boxes of Count Chocula. It all started Friday, when Kevin, one of my co-workers brought in a bag of gum. Several of us in the newsroom spent the day regressing to our childhoods as we chewed and popped bubbles while writing our stories. On Saturday, I stopped by the office to pick up a notepad and looked inside the wooden box on my desk where we keep candy. To my luck, there were a few pieces of gum left. So I took a piece and popped it in my mouth as I left the newsroom. Driving back home, I returned to my youth, when my friend Tiffany and I would enter bubble gum blowing contests in South Bound Brook NJ (where we used to live). I began to blow bubbles while listening to music, forgetting my age and how ridiculous I must look to other drivers while stopped at traffic lights. For those of you who are gum aficionados, you know how well Dubble Bubble works in bubble blowing. As I was driving home from the grocery store, I decided to blow the largest bubble I could. I pursed my lips and exhaled steadily as the blue sphere ballooned. The mass grew larger than I expected, nearly touching the tip of my nose. Then the bottom gave out. The bubble collapsed, smacking onto my lips and chin before imploding completely. I pulled the remainder of the piece in my mouth and continued chewing and touched my chin with my hand to feel how much remained. When I pulled up to the house, I looked at the mirror behind the sun visor in my car and saw blue goo all over my chin and lips. I rushed into the house and took a piece of ice from the freezer to remove the gum. It took me about five minutes, ice and hydrogen peroxide to remove the gum. I'll leave bubble blowing to the kids. Sorry if this story sucks, but Jeff has been harassing me throughout its creation. He's biting my face and neck. I'm dating a vampire.

       Ok, thanks to Miss Berghom, I am here and you are there and we're all wondering...what the heck is this?   I'm not sure either. Blogger doesn't really define it, nor does Webster. But what does he know anyway?  It's a website, message board, sounding board, soapbox, etc.  It will also be part of my own evil plot but that's for me to know and you...  Hee hee hee.  Anyway, my very witty and erudite friend from an era long ago happened upon this little piece of chaos and now we're here.  Jen posted my Pulitzer-worthy piece from the ArchVoices competition on her site (http://jenniferlberghom.blogspot.com) so I won't bore you with it again. (I'm modest, aren't I?)  But here's the deal. You're gonna talk to me. Tell me anything. Comment on my writing because it's obvious the ArchVoices committee was on something when they read my submission... Or was it the other way around?  ;o)  Or, you guys can tell me news... post a joke... play cards...   Anyway- enough for now. Happy Memorial Day! Don't drink and drive and don't eat the yellow snow. Cheers! -jld

               What gives me the right to philosophize? And how come I can fathom my own mortality? How come our existence is measured by property instead of integrity? And how come hot dogs come in packs of ten and buns in packs of eight?      I am going to declare war. I am not sure on what or whom, but it sounds good enough that I think I can do it. I am a woman and therefore have raged many a battle in the past; I am sure for lesser evils.       Perhaps a war on humankind. One in which economies and a people will not be annihilated but a war that all of us will fight within ourselves. This is not meant to necessarily mock but as a gesture for all of us to explore what is naturally ours to begin with: thought. Humans think. Sometimes this isn&#8217;t a good thing. &#8220;I thought I saw you doing this&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll have another beer before I leave to go drive on the Interstate&#8221;. &#8220;I thought this was the right choice.&#8221;      Thinking. Definitely an evil. Certainly a bonus to our existence on this planet.&nbsp; Think about it. Or not. No one has yet been able to tap into this very rich resource. One where secrets can be kept, truths told, and lies can manifest.&nbsp; All in milliseconds. Even faster.      What stays and what goes may seem to be random but is really decided by little &#8220;File Sorters&#8221; in your head. You can picture it.&nbsp; Some Seuss-like character sifting through stacks of monotonous dissertations and random facts.&nbsp; Pieces of paper flitting about in a frenzy of uncontrollable chaos. I see Woody Allen peering over the rim of his glasses saying something to the effect of, &#8220;Do you really need this? &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m not sure you do&#8230; but if you think you do, then fine&#8221; All the while his epileptic-like movements create a domino-effect of &#8220;Algebra 1&#8221; and &#8220;Grammar Principles&#8221; pieces getting knocked into file 13 (read: trash) at the same time &#8220;Silly Acronyms and their meanings&#8221; and &#8220;Words to Journey songs&#8221; get pigeon-holed in the About-to-store-for-good-in-Rubbermaid-brain-cells.      It&#8217;s all crazy.&nbsp; The mind that is. An evolutionary masterpiece. Unquestionably the most controversial object available to humankind. A device that can interpret, interpolate, calculate, manipulate, operate, evaluate, and sometimes even slice, dice, and julienne. The only problem is that we don&#8217;t and can&#8217;t purchase it for 3 easy payments of $19.95 on QVC. Yeah. We&#8217;re born with it.      So, why the introduction? Well.&nbsp; Are you thinking yet? No? That will be my job. If yes, then good. You get an A+ for this section. You see, we all know that we use barely 10% of our brain capacity. How do we know this? Well, we&#8217;ve heard it. Somewhere. And of course, we have accepted the fact that it must be true because someone told us. Not only that, it is easy to justify that we haven&#8217;t used all of our brain. I mean, how many of us can still recollect the Preamble to the Constitution that we were forced to learn in the fourth grade. Did we forget it? Did it leave? Did we delete it? Or is it sitting in the recycle bin of our mind waiting for a true recall command? Other things &#8211; molecular biology, for instance. This is not a subject I find most fascinating, however some people do and spend their lifetime looking through a microscope in order to study the subject. Since I do not know the first thing about cell division or what a mitochondria is, I still have more to learn. If I can still learn, then my brain is not full.       Surely, it pisses you off when your computer says &#8220;Resources dangerously low&#8221;. I&#8217;ve always wondered about that too. You know when we&#8217;ve completely depleted the South American rain forests and stripped the land of all its natural beauty, will God send us a popup message&#8230; &#8220;Resources dangerously low.&#8221;&nbsp; And then will we ignorantly hit the &#8220;OK&#8221; button, if for nothing else just to see what He will do?      You see, this is our ability &#8211; as humans &#8211; to think. To write. To speak. To communicate.      I still think it&#8217;s crazy.&nbsp; So, do any of you talk to yourself? If not, you should. Interact. Live a little. Play.

       Preface: A very good friend of mine is getting married. Having travelled this road, I sometimes offer advice to help him through - other times, I just make fun.    Here I make fun. ----  Ah. And the days continue to dwindle in Singledom.  She gets frustrated when you can't proffer a position on where to place Aunt Sue and Uncle Mac. "But honey, you know they had a fight with Cousin Margaret last year… If I put them within 10 yards of each other - we'll see the mashed potatoes start a-flyin'!"  … Your only hope- a simple "yes, dear" and a prayer that her intuitive skills will lead the place  urlLink cards  in the right direction…   "What about that friend, Jane? Can I put her with that other chic Tracy?"… Where upon your mind wanders - delicicously - to a mental episode of what "putting them together" might entail… "Richard!" Your intended brings you back to consciousness and you remind her that it doesn't matter… "I only want you to be happy, sweetie." She shrugs and sighs, tells you she loves you and gets back to the quantum physics and algebraic analysis of guest placement.  Where's that to-do list? You know that there was something important to do today? Ah yes, head count to the caterer. But how many vegan plates did we need? Or were we having a buffet? You start to walk back into the dining room where she's diligently working only to recall her imploring statement as you left the  urlLink house  this morning…"Don't forget we have 75 regular… hum in nuh, hum in nuh… blah bli di blah… " You saw the new EXP from Bentley drive by… damn, that Johnson down the street… I can't believe he actually bought one… hum in num…. Yes, dear. I  urlLink love  you too… I'll call you later… And now…   Dammit. Doesn't she realize that  urlLink cars  and boobs are the only things that drive a man's imagination?   Stay tuned for next week's installment… "One of the groomsmen announces that the bachelor party is taking place at Hedonism… "

               What happens when you attempt to stop a speeding Toyota with your own Ford sedan?       They both lose.       Just a reminder to take the time to kiss goodbye those you love every morning&#8230; Taking this time just might be the time God has set aside for you to avoid these mishaps. This, in light of the fact that Roger didn't want to wake me on Friday morning&#8230; needless to say, I was already awake - groggy, but awake. He - in a hurry to get some breakfast-to-go and make it to work on time - misses an opportunity to enjoy just a few seconds of time before his day begins.      The result, however, is interesting.       Yes, we have wrecked car.     Yes, thank goodness, Roger is alright.       Yet we find out an interesting medical anomaly about Roger.        Everything happens for a reason.       So, I guess I can forgive him for not kissing me goodbye and wreckin' the car.
