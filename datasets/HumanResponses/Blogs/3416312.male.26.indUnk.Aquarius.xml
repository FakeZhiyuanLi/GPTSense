      that is, another dollar i have made to pay bills, and keep my head above water. (sort of).  I felt good today. Most of the day went smooth, and little upset me. however, i drank again after work. i dunno why, i just thought i would have one drink, and that would be the end of it. then i started reading my old blogs (now deleted), and it all went downhill from there. I went harder than usual this time. almost a complete 26. (2 micks).  Well, when the wife got home, of course i saw the dissapointment in her eyes, and the now so usual rolling of her eyes, saying, for fuck sakes, not again.  It kills me every time I dissapoint her. yet I seem to do it over and over again. This is the self destruction of my marriage. I don't know why. I know she wants out, she has to, but i don't think that she wants to be the one to instigate it. She wants it to be me. for her, it needs to be my fault we didn't succeed.  I wonder if she knows yet that I don't quit. I'll stick it out. I always wondered...nah, i don't wanna go there.  Where would I go? all of what we have built for 5 years would be lost. I dunno. fuck. i dunno anything anymore.again, self doubt is rampant. my behavior is changing, but oh so very slowly.  I can go for 2 weeks without a drink. then, i dunno, i snap, and wish to transport myself out of the world. why is that. what is there underneath everything that i can't see? what is it that I can't come to terms with? I wish i knew, so I could get it over with. I've spent most of my life acting as others wanted / expected me to. now I don't know who the real me is. wow, you know, i think thats it. or part of it anyways. hmm, the real me. i have never really thought about that. me thinks i have some thinking to do.  outty.

      Well, after deleting all of my old posts, and wanting to start fresh, I have screwed up again. Why did I do it? Well, I think the bottom line is - I am unsatisfied with the way things are going for me right now. I don't beleive that my wife wishes to stay - and think that she may be finding 'outlets' for her frustrations elsewhere....if u know what I mean.  Add to that a drinking problem (IE: ME), and whammo, instant insanity. (well, after a couple of drinks, that is).   So, I dunno what to do. Should I call it quits, so that she could be free to do what she wants, or should I stick it out because I am an unreceptive moron who thinks of nothing but himself?   She hasn't left yet (physically), but I think she may have gone mentally a long time ago. But if she is 'having an affair', she's hiding it well. For as paranoid as I am, I can't find any clues or hints.  Although, now that I think about it, she does use text messaging on her phone quite often, and sometimes goes to the bathroom to do it. she is quite secrative of who is messaging her, she say's it's always her freind, "V", but somehow I don't think so.  Doubt and insecurity run rampant the brain at this point. I can't tell if she is sticking out because she thinks it will all just go away, or if she is waiting for me to concede defeat, so that it wasn't her that looks like she wanted it....  I dunno. Whatever.
