      One of the main reasons I dislike Michael Moore so much, interestingly enough I just wrote about.  He's one of those self-loathing jokers that is so far out there that I can't even take him seriously.  He's full of lies, manipulates the truth and finds himself wallowing is own hypocrisy.  For these reasons alone I have little (no) respect for him.  He may claim to be an advocate of peace, but his matter of "advocating," if you will, is atrocious.   But I'll get into specifics here, since that's what was requested.  Lets start with his comments on US involvement in the Middle East.  He says on his website that:   "Halliburton is not a "company" doing business in Iraq. It is a WAR PROFITEER, bilking millions from the pockets of average Americans."  -Michael Moore, from michaelmoore.com  In his upcoming movie Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore uses images of dead solders' parents, war victims, and many other war-associated images.  What does all this equate to for Moore in the end?  It equals money in  HIS  pocket!   Lots of money , for him alone.  That's what movies do, they generate revenues.  So he too then, is a WAR PROFITEER by definition, even more so than a company like Halliburton which serves a useful purpose.  See the hypocrisy?  What about his clever assault on Mr. Heston in Bowling for Columbine?  How about that insensitive speech that Heston made in Denver right after the Columbine shootings?  Try a YEAR later - and not in Denver - in  urlLink Charlotte, NC !!!  This type of clever editing he used numerous times in that film to "prove" his points.  But that's not proof in my eyes, that just what it is...clever editing.    Another similar edit in the same movie occurred when he claimed Heston showed up the next day in Flint, Michigan after the murder of Kayla Rolland.  In fact, he was in Flint, Michigan but not the next day, it was  eight months later!  (Feb. 29 vs Oct. 17, 2000) And to top it off, it had nothing to do with Kayla Rollands murder, it was actually a "get out the vote" rally for the upcoming presidential elections!  So basically he tricked you into thinking something you shouldn't have.  Wonderful.   What else? How about his charge to keep US jobs within our borders?  No more outsourcing he claims!  Wait, what about this:   Liberal Hollywood film producer Michael Moore, who has been an outspoken critic of President George W. Bush and his policies since he was first elected in 2000, is in hot water over outsourcing his web site design and servers to non-American companies.    Moore, who has championed the cause of keeping American jobs within the borders of the United States during the recent debate over outsourcing, has himself granted a company named PLANK the job of developing and designing the look and operation of Moore's web site.   Despite his vehement objections to outsourcing American jobs, Moore still hired the Montreal-based company to create his web site.   In addition, the web host server for Moore's web site is also Canadian-owned by Webcore Labs, whose home office is located in Calgary, Alberta.  Appearing at this year's Cannes Film Festival with his film Fahrenheit 9/11, which alleges that the Bush administration orchestrated the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 with Usama bin Laden, Moore is expected to continue bashing Bush and his policies on outsourcing, among others.   Moore did not respond to messages regarding this story. - FreeRepublic.com   What was that about outsourcing again, Mike?    I can go on and on, and I will if you like.  I watched Bowling for Columbine, twice actually.  The first time was by accident.  The second time was to try and clear up, exactly, what he was trying to accomplish with the movie.  He talked about guns, murder, Columbine, bullets, the NRA, the KKK, Canada, big Corporations, and a bunch of other topics.  All wrapped up in one big inflammatory package.  He does make you think, I give him that.  But not about anything straightforward or tangible.  He draws no real conclusion about anything and makes all SORTS of references and linking things together, when in fact they probably have little or nothing to do with each other.  Kmart is responsible for the Columbine killings.  Guns are bad, because they are.  Dick Clark killed Kayla, oh and so did Charlton Heston.  And on and on.  And in the end you'd think we live in the worst place in the world.    And then I think back and realize that many of the "points" he made are based on twisted truths or clever editing, and THAT makes me think that he's full of it.    There is certainly nothing wrong with wanting to live in a peaceful world.  That's what I want after all.  I think everyone does in the end.  But if you want people to listen to you, respect you and your opinions, and treat you with even keel (regardless of your beliefs or position) you'd better speak with integrity, honestly, and intelligence.  None of which I really believe Michael Moore possesses.

      Sometimes I wonder what is going through America's collective mind.   Let me preface this entry by stating that I do know that there are plenty of good ol' Patriots out there.  Plenty of people out there who stand behind this country through thick or thin, and I commend all of you.    On the other hand, there seems to be another huge contention of people out there who really don't seem to be happy with this country.  Or at least you wouldn't know from some of the things that are said, published or "reported" on.  Take Ted Kennedy's recent statement:    "Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management - U.S. management."   I can only associate a comment like this with slander.  I mean honestly, are we really running, operating and managing torture chambers now?  I think not.  If anyone thinks otherwise, please let me know.  So under the [correct] assumption that we are not really in the business of running torture chambers, that leads me to believe that this statement is crap.  It is crap.  So how does that reflect on us as whole when our political leaders spew crap from their mouths, not only to us but also to the world?   How does that reflect on our integrity as a nation?  I certainly understand that there are plenty of folks out there that have opposing views on things, and that's fine.  But don't tell me that self-loathing and slanderous remarks do anything positive for our image in the eyes of other nations (especially Arab nations) or do anything to strengthen our resolve  anywhere .  And it's not just Kennedy.  That goes for the media in general, broadcasting to the world an impression that we are something that we're not.  The actions of a very few (Abu Gharib) do not reflect the actions of US forces as a whole, nor the intent that most Americans have.  Don't make us out to be something we're not.  It makes us look foolish and makes out tasks at hand as a NATION much more difficult.  Too much focus on the negative, and NO focus on the positives.

      I'm not to thrilled with the media these days.    Even the sources that I've typically considered the better sources for finding out my news on the world/politics/whatever have been letting me down lately.  As everyone knows (or should know) the media creates the hype that THEY want to sell.  All the major news networks typically publish articles on the biggest and baddest news, as it happens.  But what about after it happens?  What about those events that are relatively HUGE outside of our America?  What about those events that have rather significant implications for not only the countries and people directly involved, but could also provide a nice smack in the face to the good ol' US?  So on a global level, what are we missing out on?   This started as a thought surrounding news as it comes out of the Middle East.  I was a little upset that nothing is being discussed about a recent discovery of WMD near Baghdad.  Sarin is no joke.  The second this discovery was made, it was buried. Buried by countless other and often-time meaningless stories. Buried by the Abu Gharib "atrocities."  Not to condone anything that went on there at ALL, but that event has been blown way out of proportion relative to many other relevant and important issues.  Anyway, not to go on a tangent, but that's what got me started.  Forget local news channels.  Well at least the ones here in Southern California.  I can't even take it sometimes...listening to "BREAKING NEWS" about some ass cream that removes dimples.  Or some crap about "BREAKING NEWS" having to do with the latest fashion trends or some idiot celebrity.  Please.  Show whatever you want, just don't call THAT news.  Granted there are plenty of people out there who eat that stuff up - and more power to them - but it's hardly important next to the big fish that are frying all over the world.  Basically there is too much "blinding" that takes place with stupid reporting about stupid stuff.  I can certainly elaborate but thats how I feel.  I have to give credit to the sources that do produce quality media, though there seem to be few.  Often times even these sources end up being biased or start jumping on the bandwagon of bullshit.  But there do exist a few good sources out there.  One in particular,  urlLink Strategic Forecasting  provides some killer insight on many issues you would never even know are taking place.  They have a very unbiased and non-partisan approach to their reporting and analysis, and have some incredible sources from around the world.  Take a look for yourself.  They're basically like a private CIA.    Anyway, thats all for now.  I have some other thoughts on this issue that I'll touch on later.

      Last night my girlfriend and I were walking down the street in our neighborhood and saw a car parked at a meter.  Well, it wasn't just parked nicely in the parallel spot, the entire right rear quarter of the car was up ON the curb and at a severe angle.  We stopped and laughed, commenting on what kind of driver could possible park a car like that.  We almost thought it was a joke...but no.  Someone really parked their car as if they had done it with their eyes closed and on some sort of hallucinogen.    Anyway, we continued on our merry way.  On our way home while passing the same piss-poorly-parked car, we saw the culprits.  A  very  elderly couple getting into the car.  Then it all made sense...big surprise huh?  So the elderly parking-pro and his wife got in the car and got ready to leave their spot.  The street they were pulling out into had moderate traffic flowing in only one lane.  So basically you don't pull out of your parallel spot until you are in the clear, with no cars coming from behind you.  But nooooooo...that was not the case.    Apparently the  Elderly Driving Handbook  say that:   "...when exiting a parallel parking spot, ensure that oncoming traffic is approaching fast from behind your vehicle.  Then lurch your vehicle out directly in front of other vehicle as it approaches.  Do not yield.  Other vehicles will swerve around you.  If first vehicle misses and swerves around you, slam on brakes as if you recognize your mistake, but then lurch again at the following car.  Please ensure that you cut off the second vehicle enough to cause them to swerve into the opposing lane of traffic.  Only after you have lurched your vehicle towards at least two (2) drivers may you proceed to fully exit your parking spot and continue on your way...to reign terror upon other unsuspecting drivers.."   So I have to hand it to that gentleman...he followed his handbook word-for-word.  Seriously though, I realize that there are plenty of bad drivers out there that you just have to do your best to watch out for.  But as soon as I saw this incident, I was immediately reminded of a horrible incident that happened literally just blocks from my house.  You will recall the terrible tragedy that occurred last summer when an elderly gentleman drove his car through the crowded Santa Monica farmers market killing about a dozen people and injuring many, many more.    So when I saw this man driving like he had no clue what was going on around him, it kinda scared me.  Especially in a neighborhood with an elementary school and several churches with lots of little kids walking across the street and such.  Drivers need to be on point in these types of areas.  Just a few days ago we watched as a driver blew through a two-way stop (at an intersection) without even a hint of slowing down.  I think he actually accelerated through the stop as he turned.  I wish I had spike strips to toss in front of him.    So how we deal with drivers who really have lost their ability to drive worth a damn?  I've met plenty of older people who are sharp as tacks and can drive with no problem.  But I know there are plenty of slightly younger (elder) drivers that literally should NOT be allowed behind the wheel.  What do we do about this?     Oh yeah...and the point of this is not to bag on old people.  However, if I were driving as bad as some of these people (regardless of age), you wouldn't want me on the road either.

      Recently I had the privilege of listening to two highly decorated Generals speak at a luncheon here in Los Angeles.  Much of the discussion involved our current situation in Iraq, and the direction America is headed over the next few years with regard to national security and terrorism.  An interesting point was made by a guest about terrorism, where we are today, and how things were once upon a time (not that long ago actually).    The Cold War was a time of heightened security, intelligence and fear between two of the world superpowers at the time, the former Soviet Union and the United States.  As the nuclear arms race proliferated, the two nations stood in fear of each other or rather, in fear of what the other side could possibly do in a worst-case scenario.  Fear of a nuclear war that - once started - would end in probable annihilation of both sides.  That fear caused a tense standoff between the two nations for many years.  That impending fear caused both sides to essentially never do anything at all.  So we had a nuclear standoff which we now call the Cold War.   Each side knew that if they were to make a move the other side would respond with equal or greater force and the resulting escalation would end in a nuclear holocaust.  Well as it turns out neither side was willing to take that risk and make a first move.  I would imagine that there was an overwhelming sense of accountability that existed in the minds of decision-makers at the time.    Anyway, the point the guest made associated the sense of accountability and responsibility that existed during the Cold War to those nations today which support (or harbor) terrorist organizations.  For the sake of national security, perhaps we should let it be known by whatever means necessary that acts of terror on American soil will not be tolerated under any circumstances.  Instill the same type of fear and accountability that existed during the Cold War into the minds and hearts of terror organizations.    Unfortunately we're not dealing with a rational enemy by any means here.  An enemy that celebrates death as the ultimate reward is a difficult enemy to defeat.  Furthermore, unconventional warfare and the use of civilian targets only compounds the problem.   Diplomacy is not even an option as far as I can tell.  As far as I can recall, I don't remember Osama Bin Laden asking the US for some sort of resolution before he murdered over 3000 people on September 11, 2001.    Now I'm NOT suggesting here that we just go out and start tossing nuclear weapons around in the event of a terrorist attack.  But I am suggesting that we let it be known that overwhelming force will used against any organization or countries that are directly involved with a terror attack on our soil.     I would liken these terrorist groups to cancer.  If untreated it spreads and will likely kill you.  If you treat or remove most of it but not all, it will probably return.  As far as I know, there is no definitive cure for cancer but with overwhelming shocks to the system, you can at least contain it and maybe overcome it.  So what's it going to take to rid our world of this "cancer?"

       ON SUICIDE BOMBERS:   What does it take to get someone to strap high explosives to their body and blow themselves up?  At the minimum, a lifetime of brainwashing would be my guess.  The mentality behind such an act is beyond comprehension for most all of us.  For the purpose of this discussion, I'll leave out those people who kill themselves for whatever reason not associated with any "cause."  Generally we think of suicide as an isolated and selfish act of desperation.  From my experience with suicide, its been committed by people that were well liked, educated and seemingly had a lot going for them.  They certainly didn't fit any "profile" (if there is one) of someone you'd expect to kill themself.  But I'm not going to discuss these people...I want to figure out what goes on in the minds of those people who kill themselves (and most often times many others at the same time) for a cause, religion, belief, or whatever.    So what is it that causes people to drink the Kool-Aid or strap high explosives to their body?  Some pretty darn good and effective brainwashing I'd think.  Take Hamas and Hezbollah for example.  They seem to have a handy group of suicide bombers eager to hop onto Israeli buses and blow themselves up.  Is it the hope of becoming a martyr, achieving enlightenment, or some other intangible promise of wonderful rewards on the "other side?"  I guess that's part of it.  And if the higher powers and leaders in Hamas and Hezbollah and Al Qaeda really preach and assumably BELIEVE what they are preaching, then why are THEY not going out and killing themselves?  After all, that's the path to Nirvana right?  Instead all the minions are running out and blowing themselves up.    I think that part of this can be explained by the religious elite among these groups exploiting the ignorance of these suicide bombers.  I would imagine that the vast majority come from a background of little education or opportunity.  Worth noting though, the individuals who flew 767's into the WTC were obviously educated enough to learn to fly passenger jets, but what about the rest?  Is it exploitation of an ignorant or oppressed mass, superb brainwashing, both, or something else entirely?    A month or two ago, a little Palestinian boy was stopped at an Israeli checkpoint.  He had a bomb strapped to his body.  I think the kid was like 10 years old.  After the tense hour or so it took to disarm the boy who was obviously terrified, he was questioned by Israeli authorities.  Basically the kid was scared and confused, and said that he didn't really want to kill himself.  He just wanted to go home.  So they obviously start 'em young.    And to make things worse...how do you defeat a threat that believes dying is the best thing that could happen to them?  Anyway, just thinking...any suggestions?
