      In my family practice clinic, I have a lot of good days as my nurse and I sift through the miliau of ambulatory illnesses that cross my path.  Occasionally, we have a day (or a string of days) where we feel like asking, "Do you want fries with that?"  Let me explain.  In this culture of fast food and 7-11s, that has been the mantra of customer service.  People are used to ordering in a loud voice thru a drive through speakerbox.  They are everywhere, pharmacies, banks, dry cleaning, and even the big red drive-thru beer barn on the seedy side of my town.  In the old fashioned world of the office of a family practice doctor, we are still clinging to the exercise of face to face communication.  Most of my patients love this type of interaction, especially the older, retired people who clutch their bags of medication and Medicare cards hoping to win the jackpot of longevity thru pills.    There are a few, however, who make my nurse feel like a waitress and me, a board-certified, yada yada, physician as a short order cook.  Is this really the kind of relationship you want with some people who have the potential to really help you or hurt you?  If I was a lazy person, I could just write out whatever drugs people felt they needed.  In fact, I could just install a vending machine and people would just insert their credit cards and then push a button.  I could be a kazillionaire.  But then, what a waste of education and many years and late nights of studying pharmacology, physiology, biochemistry, and other useless medical school classes it would be.    These fast food medicine consumers will tire of my long explantions about how this particular antibiotic they want (after seeing on that catchy commercial on TV) will not kill the bacteria that is currently infecting their prostate.  They will move on to other doctors, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, urgent care centers, emergency rooms and other providers that will be most happy to give them what they want and supersize their order for only a dollar more.

						   I am a slow starter, last one to get the CD player type, and I am going for the Blog.  So here goes...  While I was watching the Olympics the other day, one of the trivia facts thrown in my the usually inane sportscasters was the average income in the Ukraine was $76 a month.  That really stuck in my brain and I am not sure that is even right.  But it made me think about how rich materially we Americans are, yet so often we think we lack so much.  A single person making $780 a month in my town qualifies for indigent assistance at our local hospital.  Considering how much medical care can cost, that is probably appropirate.  Ukraines are taxed at 80% and get free health care, but apparently you have to bring your own cotton swabs and gauze.  As I watched more Olympics, I noticed some of the atheletes representing foreign countries were actually American (living here).   I further understood the love/ hate realtionship for Americans around the world.  We are one of the few countries in the world that people want to come to live and work in.  We are not a country that many people leave or that a government has to fence in or shoot at when escaping.  But what I think Americans often need to be reminded of is that material wealth doesn't necessarily promise happiness.  I saw it in the faces of a Ukranian gymnast who did a really great routine, joy.  I just wished that they could have looked more well-nourished like the Americans.
