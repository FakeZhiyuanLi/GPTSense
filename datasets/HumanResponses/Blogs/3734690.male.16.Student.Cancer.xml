       By Greg Strong   There has been a lot speculation about Nomar Garciaparra's future in a Red Sox uniform. Garciaparra will be a free agent next season and many people think that he wants to head west to a team like the Angels or the Dodgers, so he can live a nice lifestyle with his wife Mia Hamm. Both Anaheim and Los Angeles are very active in acquiring a player like Nomar hoping he will be the final piece to their World Series roster. The big debate has been to trade, let Nomar sign with another team, or sign him. Now let's explore all three possibilities.   Trade Many trade possibilities have surfaced during last offseason including a deal that would have sent Nomar to the White Sox in return for the 5-tool center fielder Magglio Ordonez. This trade would have proven wrong the theory that Nomar wants to go to California to play ball and it also doesn't make too much sense for the Red Sox. Johnny Damon has been a stable leadoff hitter at center field for the Sox and has recently become a fan favorite with his Jesus-like looks. A trade to Los Angeles makes much more sense for the Red Sox. The Sox have made it clear that they are going to go for pitching during late July and what better place to acquire pitching than Los Angeles. Last year, there were trade rumors involving Odalis Perez and with his contract running up at the end of the year there is going to be even more rumors. Odalis Perez has posted a 4-3 record so far this season along with a nice 2.88 ERA in 14 starts and seems to be a good fit with the Red Sox. Another team in the hunt for Nomar would be the Anaheim Angels. The Angels had a big offseason by signing Vladamir Guerrero, Bartolo Colon, Jose Guillen, and Kelvim Escobar, but their not stopping now. The Angels have a stacked minor league system including third baseman Dallas McPherson, first baseman Casey Kotchman, catcher Jeff Mathis, and pitcher Ervin Santana among others. If the Red Sox want to deal Nomar for prospects remains to be seen, but if they do than it's likely that’s where Nomar will end up. If Nomar is traded than Pokey Reese will likely move to shortstop and Bellhorn would occupy second base. Trading Nomar may really hurt the Red Sox chances at a World Series title, but it might have to be done.  Releasing Nomar Letting Nomar go would probably be the worst case scenario for the Red Sox. Although it may help bring a championship home this year, it would hurt the Red Sox in the long run. Some critics have also proposed the idea to move Nomar to second base and groom Pokey Reese into our shortstop of the future. Let me be the first to say that this idea is pure ludicrous. Nomar is one of the best defensive shortstops hurt or not and the Red Sox would be insane not to put Nomar at shortstop. The Red Sox may be able to let Nomar go, just not now. The Red Sox #1 organizational prospect is a 5-tool shortstop named Hanley Ramirez, probably won't be ready for the majors until 2006. The Sox first pick in the 2004 Amateur Draft was also another shortstop named Dustin Pedroia. It seems like the Red Sox are preparing to let Nomar go, but not just yet.  Resigning Nomar Signing Nomar seems to be the most logical thing to do. Nomar is only 30 years old, even though it seems that he is past his prime hitting the baseball, he's still a top 3 shortstop in the league. Having Nomar at shortstop would keep the Red Sox World Series hopes alive for years to come. Nomar has said before that he would like to stay in Boston and it seems to me like Boston would like him to stay for at least a couple more years until their younger talent develops. Nomar right now is playing for a contract for next season. The achilles tendon injury he suffered during spring training when he was hit by a ball has seemed to slow him down a bit. It took him a lot longer than people suspected and he didn't do very well in his rehab stint in AAA Pawtucket. We shouldn't be worried yet, but if Nomar continues to struggle at the major league level, I would highly doubt we are going to see Nomar in a Red Sox uniform whether we release him or trade him before the deadline or during the Patriots Superbowl run.

      By: Greg Strong  &nbsp;  Only 3 weeks till the trade deadline and already there has been rumors about 3 former Cy Young Award winners and many other of the league’s top stars. Luckily for you I get to sort all of this out for you.   Randy Johnson  Possible Teams interested: Yankees, Angels, Red Sox, Mets, and maybe Cubs?  Even though Arizona is struggling mightily, the Big Unit still wants to stay in Arizona. Why? Well that is a good question. Johnson already has his World Series ring and he’s happy with his family in Arizona. Johnson gave Arizona’s GM 12 teams that he would like to play for and the Mets, who were pursuing Johnson, were not on of those 12 teams. Sorry Mets fans.. Theo Epstein has made phone calls so Shonda Schilling will sit next to Randy Johnson’s wife. People have also said that Curt Schilling has tried to convince Randy to come to Boston. Well that is total false, Curt and Johnson talk on a weekly basis about their pitching and no evidence of Curt trying to convince the Big Unit to come to Beantown. It’s been reported that the Johnson would waive his no-trade clause to go to New York , the only problem with Johnson going to New York is that Arizona does not like the Yankees farm system which, could result in Johnson going elsewhere. There has been the 3 team rumor between the Diamondbacks, Red Sox, and Cubs that would send Johnson to the Diamondbacks, Nomar Garciaparra to the Cubs and the Cubs sending prospects to the Diamondbacks, this has yet to be confirmed by any GM. The White Sox also want another pitcher, possibly Johnson. The White Sox could package a deal that would include 3rd baseman Joe Crede. The Cubs also might be in the hunt for Johnson after the injury of Mark Prior.   Roger Clemens  Possible teams interested: Yankees, Red Sox  I really don’t know how this rumor started, but it is totally false, the Rocket isn’t going anywhere. Rocket is also with his family in Houston, where his kids can come to the ballpark and watch Clemens play. There really isn’t any point for Clemens to leave, he is happy in Houston. If the Astros fall out of playoff contention they will resort to trading other players, but not Clemens. Wouldn’t it be ironic if the most hated pitcher in Boston came back to help the Sox break the curse? Roger’s mom once said "They treated him worse than Hitler." With that said, the Rocket isn’t going anywhere.   Barry Zito  Possible teams interested: Orioles, Phillies  The rumor is that Zito would go to the Orioles for one of the O’s second basemen, B.J. Ryan, and a prospect. The Orioles are pretty much out of the race for the year, but Zito would be a good ace for the future. The A’s are looking for another 2nd baseman to replace the injured Mark Ellis, so either Jerry Hairston or Brian Roberts would be good replacements. The other rumor with Zito is that he would go to the Phillies in return for Kevin Millwood, Placido Polanco, and a prospect. Both of these deals seem unlikely.   Carlos Beltran  Possible teams interested: Yankees, Red Sox, Padres, White Sox, Dodgers, Cubs, Phillies  Just a couple weeks after Beltran was dealt, he was put back on the trading block. The Astros are falling out of contention and Beltran seems like a prime candidate to leave the Astros. Carlos’ agent, Scott Boras, is looking for Beltran to get one of the biggest contracts in the major leagues and the Astros cannot afford that right now. In result of these contract issues, guess who but the Red Sox and Yankees are the prime candidates. Carlos has really exploded since arriving to the Astros blasting 5 homers so far. Just about everyone would like to have Beltran in their outfield whether its in centerfield or rightfield.   Jeff Kent  Possible teams interested: Yankees, Dodgers, Cubs  Kent is the other candidate to be traded away from the Astros. The Yankees could really use a second baseman, but the Yankees don’t really have enough prospects at this point to trade. It remains to be seen if Dioner Navarro and Alex Graman would be enough to get a quality player like Kent, Beltran, or Boone. My guess is that Kent stays where he is, but that’s just me.   Kris Benson  Possible teams interested: Mets, Phillies, Yankees, Twins, Rangers, Angels  The rumor on the street right now is that Kris Benson would be dealt for Ty Wigginton and a prospect, most likely Craig Brazzel. Benson is the best pitcher who is really on the market. Benson has good stuff at this point, he is just having trouble learning how to use it. Benson would really be a valuable addition to any team looking for a pitcher.   Steve Finley  Possible teams interested: Padres, Yankees, Red Sox  Before I talk about Finley, I just thought I’d mention it’s pretty funny that the Yankees have been interested in every player so far. With that said if Steve Finley is most likely going to go to San Diego if he’s dealt. Finley owns a home in San Diego, so that would be his #1 place if he is traded. The buzz killer about Finley is that he may sign an extension with the Diamondbacks.   Miguel Batista  Possible teams interested: Twins, Yankees  Quietly Batista has been having a solid season with a 3.85 ERA. The Twins have showed interest in Batista, but he is still optimistic that the Blue Jays will turn it around and start playing like the team that they should be.   Carlos Delgado  Possible teams interested: Red Sox, Dodgers, Marlins  J.P. Riccardi would like to move Carlos Delgado, but the problem is that Delgado said that he won’t waive his no-trade clause to go to a contender. After what looked like it would be a promising season, the Blue Jays have gone south and are looking to dump payroll with players like Delgado, Frank Catalanotto, and Miguel Batista. Delgado is in his contract year and is not likely to be re-signed by the Blue Jays, if he refuses to waive his no-trade clause   Ramon Ortiz  Possible teams interested: Mets, Twins, Yankees  Ramon Ortiz has demanded a trade after he was demoted to bullpen duties in favor of Aaron Sele. The Angels would like to keep Ortiz because they would like him in the rotation in the future but Ortiz seems unhappy. The Mets would be a good fit because Ortiz’s agent said that Ortiz has family in New York and that he likes the Mets. The Mets, who appear to be out of the race for Johnson, now are looking at Ortiz and Benson.   Orlando Cabrera  Possible teams interested: Angels  The Expos said that they would trade Orlando for prospects. Orlando has had a horrid season and it’s partly because of his bad attitude and maybe a move would help him. The Angels have showed interest in him, but the move doesn’t really make that much sense If acquired Cabrera would probably move to 3rd base.   Sidney Ponson  Possible teams interested: Twins, Mets  Ponson came into this season trying to prove that last year wasn’t a fluke, and so far the results haven’t been that good. Ponson has arguably been the Orioles worst starter this season and Orioles management isn’t too happy about it. The Orioles owner is trying to test Ponson’s contract because of the loyalty cause in the Major League Uniform Player’s contract that says among other things that the player must keep himself in first class physical condition. Ponson seems like he would be very cheap after this seasons horrid performance.   Eddie Guardado  Possible teams interested: Indians, Giants, Angels, Cubs  The Mariners have been the biggest disappointment this season and they have already started their youth movement by designating John Olerud and Rich Aurilia for assignment. The problem with trading Guardado is that the Mariners wouldn’t have anyone to close, maybe Rafael Soriano when he comes back or Shiggy Hasegawa.   Kip Wells  Possible teams interested: Texas, Mets  Another Pirates pitcher who might be traded. Hasn’t really had a good year so far 4.71ERA and an ugly 1.59 WHIP (Walks/Hits per inning pitched.) On the bright side Kip Wells did have a good second half last year posting a 2.74 ERA. Texas really likes Wells, but the Pirates are going to want Kevin Mench for him.   Ugueth Urbina  Possible teams interested: Cubs, White Sox, Giants  Urbina has been the bright spot in the Detriot bullpen, but the Tigers need more prospects so Urbina is probably going to go and Franklyn German will be given another shot to close games. The Cubs are expected to go after him, especially if LaTroy Hawkins fails in the closers role. Urbina has converted 14 of 16 save chances for the Tigers and would be a very valuable set-up man.   Larry Walker  Possible teams interested: Braves, Rangers, Athletics  The Rockies are looking to dump payroll and Larry Walker said that he would waive his no-trade clause if he were dealt to a contender. The Braves look like they are the front runners for Walker. Larry has hit .321 with 4 home runs and 17 RBI’s in only 53 AB’s this season. Walker is a risk because he is very injury prone, but the man has 3 batting titles on his resume.   Jose Jimenez  Possible teams interested: Rangers  I’m guessing the Rangers can’t stop thinking about 1999. That’s when Jimenez threw a no-hitter with the St. Louis Cardinals. Because in 2004, Jimenez has been one of the worst relievers and by far worst closer in the game. Jimenez put up an ERA of 8.42 in 36.2 innings for the Indians and converted 8 of 11 save chances. He was demoted to AAA and if he clears waivers the Rangers could trade for him.   Other names being thrown around with possible destinations: Matt Riley (Yankees) , John Olerud (Red Sox, Yankees), Preston Wilson (Yankees), Shawn Chacon (Cubs), Jose Mesa (White Sox, Cubs, Marlins), Frank Catalanotto (Red Sox), Rich Aurilia (A’s)
