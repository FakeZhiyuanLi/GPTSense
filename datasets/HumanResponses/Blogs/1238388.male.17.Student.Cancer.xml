      alright, im just sittin here and running some cron scripts on my linux boxes and two of my os x computers. and watching something on nick@nite out of boredom. it seems that i usually drown in boredom... i usually like to procrastinate on homework and the like, over actually doing them. odd.  well perhaps its not that odd. its somewhat intergrated in my personality and i need to change that. ive been changing gradually over the days, weeks, and months... im hoping its a good change. im trying to do it for myself, not for others... as well as for god. i came to thinking that perhaps i dont have a real relationship with god and i need to push my thoughts out and ask god himself if he would help me. if he'll give his time to assist me on my everyday life.  it has been difficult over these past few years, and it is increasingly more difficult even now. it just seems that i have to work, work, work. no leisure, no nothing.... just work - which isnt quite compatible with my personality. at times, i would sit here in my chair, stare at that steadily blinking text cursor and nothing else, wondering if computers are what i want to do with my future. lately, i've been focused on computers and nothing else... perhaps i need to try some new things other than working on some computers. maybe i need to be in a sport that is suitable for me... maybe soccer?  i wouldnt know, and i need to think more, so i'll go, and maybe get some sleep too. take care, guys....

      hmm, cool... i'm at a  urlLink planet wisdom  conference here in santa ana, california - it has been cool so far. mark matlock is the founder of  urlLink wisdomworks ministries , as well as planet wisdom. upon my arrival at the conference, i had asked if i could get a live audio feed into my laptop system, they agreed, which was really cool. at the first time, my computer's speech recognition really sux'ed, so i suggested that mark could come down and and fine-tune the speec recog.... to my suprise, he agreed. the accurancy on it raised 18 percent at the best.  and i'm here, chuckling at their humorous acts, skits to get their message across. mark is really coolat this. i'm glad i came =D.... i'll go and watch the rest of the conference. take care, guys.....

      so.... i went a bit pyro-maniac not too long ago out of pure boredom, and i miss Kendle soooooo much. i want to see her, and talk to her again. (sigh) i love her so much, this break is just unbearable - i just need to sort myself out... i want to use our break the best I can, so i could try to better myself. i just need to get rid of bad influences, and that sort of thing.  my site's kinda complete, but still needs alot of work. i also need some donations to keep my site up and running... even $1 usd would help greatly... i'll setup a bank account soon and link it through paypal. deadline's in may, so i dont have much time.  in the meantime, i'm going to go and cleanup my room, run maintenance on my computers, and go to bed. i need the sleep... take care...

      well, well - my site has been launched, but this is only the inital design, based off a elated template, j.d. and i are building a custom, unique one that would set my site apart from others that are on the net.  it is saturday, 6.18am, and i'm fiddling with dreamweaver mx, trying to figure out coldhand, and fireworks mx included in the macromedia studio mx that i got from a good friend, he wasnt using it and didnt have a need, but i did, so its perfectly legal and not pirated (thankfully). i'm watching mr. nice guy on  urlLink tnt  with jackie chan. funny guy with good martial art skills. i'm plannin' on watching 'romeo must die' at 9pm also on tnt... i have some work ahead of me, coding and some work at remax, including some website work with  urlLink bob and marti peck  - it is long overdue. i also need to work on  urlLink duffy 's site as well... i might get 15+ computers to keep, so i can setup them at home as workstations, raid storage arrays, that such thing.  but... i have to depart to complete some work on my site, and then go to work at 8am. take care, guys....

      wednesday... the usual night of the youth group - i'm having doubts if Kendle would actually pick me up for youth group seeing that my mom doesnt have a car. but i'll be ready so i wont make her wait, i think i'll be quiet throughout... i wouldnt know what to say to Kendle as of late.  i'm making significant progress in mathematics, my independent study teacher had informed me that i have nearly caught up in the assignments for history and mathematics, which is good news... of course, i'm still stuck in lower levels of math right now and still learning the multiplication tables - it sucks, but i'm glad that i'm doing well... in other areas - my dad kinda left me with something... 'seti@home' my progress on that is going well, i have completed 580 workunits and my cpu times are at least 4 hr, 44 min, and 31.58 seconds. as for my co-owned gkwc satelllite site, 'gone krazyee... computing' - i hadn't had installed much modifications to it yet, but plan on doing... such as arcade, ibshop, and so on.  my site project i'm working on is in actuality my website - i want to make the best of my www name on the world wide web, i want to make a mark on the internet that is 'mine' -- there'll be rss feeds from thinkgeek... seti@home, and all that - it should be kool... i gotta go, though... as i said, i dont wanna make Kendle wait... take care, guys...

      ahh... just finished with  the meeting at school... i had originally arrived a the school at roughly 1.48pm as to meet Kendle, but then i realized that she might not be as apprehensive... turns out i was right... she passed by me by no more than one and half feet without acknowledging me, nor saying hello.  that hurt me. i was really sad... i couldnt even concenterate on my work during the independent study session. i didnt know what to do... except to try my best in school and try to find that one 'answer' that Kendle wanted me to find on my own. i don't know what it is... but i'll find it, regardless.  (sigh) i need to finish some my homework, and work on my site project... take care, guys...

      hmm, my friends just departed to meet some people at a casino in san diego... and i'm talking to a cousin about alot of things - basically intelligent things, elementals in life, such as my relationship with Kendle.  me and Kendle are taking a 'break' as to allow ourselves focus on other things, as well as to ourselves. this is extremely difficult, but i love her to the point to respect her wishes, as well as to accept what she wants, and to pertain to the agreement. my grades has been contiuning its downspiral, and i'm going to try to stop that downspiral and make it into a tornado and succeed at least several aspects of school.  my life's basically 'blah' at the moment, and i'm trying my best to keep up. i'm going to make the best of what i have right now. keep me in your prayers... i'm going to go... take care.

      yeah, so... a good friend that i met one and half years ago is finally coming here. i'm very sure we'll have so much fun, despite my troubles in the past few days with Kendle and the family. i plan on blowing up some stink bombs in couple of expensive stores, i mean, why do they have to overprice a simple garment? its plain crazy...  after we cruise along the lake arrowhead trail, i'm plannin' on showing him the sights around - it'd be cool... very cool. i guess this is kinda a happy moment for me today, pray for me nothing screws up. as for kendle, she just got out of school roughly half hour ago, it used to be my school... i depise it with a passion - the school's name is  urlLink Rim of the World High School , find some emails on there and spam it with mils of spam messages, will ya? thanks...  but now, i have to depart and keep a lookout for allen and flag him down to my house like a pathetic black and white checkered flag they wave at motocross races. take care...

      Ever feel like you're in an existentialist nightmare reminiscient of the strong feel of hades brought forth from the sweaty mouth of your mother-in-law's feral kitten? That's how I feel every time I forget where that blasted password key is. And whenever someone gets confoozled by Linux and installs Windows on my boxen. Not cool, I might add.  Schweet. My pants are filled with fish. Just so you know... Today is the ending of my first month, yes, I'm NOT being sarcastic, My first month from having sat here pressing F5 everyday looking for one of my multiple posts (this being yet another) and haven't seen nothing. ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN!!  Oh yeah... I have finally cracked the matrix of Windows XP. After this, I will be able to keep this posted for every KB page. Here is how I did it: Pi, just take the number of Pi, and calculate that by the possibility of the algorithms that monkeys will throw fecal code, and divide that with the number of potential number of totally invalid entries, and...Presto... So N x S / T = Owe crap, what the heck was that number again?  Know what happened to me this morning? The pet store was selling monkeys for 5¢ each. I thought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand each. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I bought 200. I like monkeys. I took my 200 monkeys home. I have a big car. I let one drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals. I laughed. Then they punched my genitals. I stopped laughing.  I'm genuinely crazy - and gone. Take care guys...

      Seeing as alot of people are living with kittens, I presume they have dealt with the cat-in-heat phenomenon. One of my friend's cats isn't spayed because she was an off-the-street rescue. Long story short, cat's in heat and the friend literally has no time during the day EVER to get her spayed. I'd take the cat, except I have no car or a license. I have tried and tried to find workable ways to get the cat spayed and can't come up with anything. It's not going to happen. Heck, the cat even got out overnight and STILL didn't get laid and yes, I was tempted to let the cat out deliberately in hopes that she would leave me alone.  Meanwhile, the cat is molesting me 24/7. Do any of you guys have any tips for coping that don't involve Q-tip use every day (friend is extremely not cool with that, and as annoyed as I am by the cat when she's horny, I can't swear I'd be gentle if I did it)? I've been shutting her in a bedroom when I get home, but then the other cat whines and pouts at me to let the sex kitten out, and when I trap the spayed cat in with her, spayed cat spends half the night trying to open the door (and occasionally succeeds because she's the smart one, and we have no locks on the bedroom doors).  I pretty much suspect there isn't anything else to do short of going out and finding the cat a boyfriend. I'm really tired of screaming at the cat to stop humping me every night... I'm gonna go. Take care, guys...

      Sorry, it's been a long time. Alienware's still broken... I guess the ETA on that might be in late May, early June. Then, I have to get everything reinstalled and set all this up again. So, I guess regular posting could theoretically continue sometime in June. More on that when it's more definite.  This concludes the Public Service Announcement...  Now for some Random Thinkings...  -- Ain't no way in hell will I be voting to re-elect Bush. -- On the Condy Rice Affair: So, let me get this straight, the President and VP will speak privately to the 911 Commission, but not if they are under oath... Nope, nothing to hide there... -- The best thing I could think of to do for Easter (a religious celebration of JC's resurrection) was to go see Hellboy. Good flick, didn't need the romantic triangle, but otherwise good flick. -- Ron Perlman should always be in special F/X makeup. -- Bought lotion for my "dry elbows." Wanting to go shopping for better pants. And shorts. -- Thinking about behavior sciences research. My theory is we are only as happy/sad, etc. as the music we are listening to. Furthermore, music helps shape our thoughts, ideals, and moral structure at the time. It's just a theory at this point. -- You know, I'm kinda glad that I'm getting back into watching  JAG  and  The Pretender . -- Too much Krispy Kreme IS a bad thing. But really how much is too much? But hey... my best friend has the nickname of Krispy Kreme... I like her, she's a good friend =D  That is all for now. Take care guys...

      mMm, since I'm not in school - there's not much excitement anymore. BUT, I've had a good evening last night with Kendle as I gave her some gifts from  Claire's . She was very happy, but I noted that just prior to leaving - she looked as if she was crying. She told me it was about her mom and her, and I asked her what was wrong.  As usual, she didn't tell me much. I didn't mind... just as long she was happy. In other news, DSL failed on me for some time and had some downtime but luckily, I had my GC82 to get online. Its useful for situations like that, slow perhaps, but useful. My  urlLink Alienware  totally failed. So I got on the phone with these tech support dudes, and tried to troubleshoot, but saw it was hopeless. They decided to give me a RMA number and a fedex label to send it to the Alienware depot. Free of charge. :D Which is good news.  So... I'm kinda quiet at the moment, nothing to say at this point. So, I'll conclude this post till another time. Take care, guys...

      Dang... Sorry about my delays on my blogs. I have been almost completely preoccupied on many things involving my relationship with Kendle and school. I'm also realizing many things but I, myself, aren't sure I could implement the actions required to make changes to succeed. I need to finish High School at the least, and go into a good college, perhaps with Kendle.  I'm thinking of working. I'm thinking of dividing my time on the computer and get a separate desk just for my work, homework, and such. And do some extraterrestrial activities, such as playing on a local AYSO soccer team. Thus taking my mind off computers. I want some responsiblity. I want to take it steadily, slowly - then work my way up. I can't do that without help, I have to work on my priority one: school. Then proceed from there.  I  have  to learn to stop being so lazy. I have to stop procrastinating. Then I would be able to decently succeed in life in several areas at the very least. I'm going to go and see what I can do to start. Take care, guys...

      Ahh, I went to this cool place, but the only BIG downside of it is te 5 mile difficult hike to it. Think 5 miles to walk with  steep  hills, sun, and heat all combined. That had taken almost all my energy just to get there, but it totally depeleted my energy trying to get back to the car.  And there is a huge gash in the ball of my foot (the bottom ball just behind the big toe), only without the blood and crap. Its unnerving to see all that damage to our body once we do that. Man.  It was sooooo good to talk to Kendle once I got home, there were some anger in her directed at me and I didn't really know what was going on. I had thought she was mad at me because I wasn't there for her today to take her to the Village. That was only a tiny part of it: Nicole had called her pathetic and wasn't really her best friend. Which really sucked. She had lied to her all this time; that was totally uncool and un-Christian of Nic.  And I'm thinking of going to bed soon, perhaps after  Mission to Mars  on Sci-Fi is finished up, and I'll scoot right back to bed. Take care, guys...

      well. i got a flight reciept for june 28th overnight flight to Atlanta, Georgia. yay.  and i got a letter from the independent study program from the school - and they said i'd be moved to the host school, which is the high school... i think its better, kendle seems insistent on me returning back to the high school. i'm a bit apprehensive because of osher (the monster teacher, mind you) and i'm hoping that i'll be assigned to ANY teacher other than osher. i dont like her, she doesn't seem to  work  along with me, rather, she  forces  her methods of teaching to me... a good teacher uses different methods of teaching to each student. in a way that the student may understand. so far, she just forced stuff down my throat, and it doesn't help, its like swallowing a equalvent of 100 15-year-old eggs in the process.  but otherwise, i'd gladly work with a teacher that'll be willing to help me learn the things that i need to learn. that's another matter completely if they'll allow me return to the high school altogether. i wrote that i'd return to the high school in kendle's slam book, and i  do not  want to disappoint her... i'm gonna go... take care, guys.

      Tuesday: Didn't go to the supposedly scheduled meeting. I haven't, nor my mom, had heard from the Independent Study teacher as of late...  So we don't know what's going on. So I don't really know anymore. I catched up on my incompletes as best as I could, but I don't see any much use for it anymore if I'm out of the program. I just don't know whats going on - :(  I completely redid my room, though - more spacey now... I did it so that my desk face my windows, so I would get the lovely view of the forestry and a occasional Blue Jay bird or a squirrel.

      Hmm. Tis a monday, and I don't even know if my scheduled meeting tomorrow is still on or not. I'm still dropped from the program as far as I know...  THAT kinda pisses me off, I shouldn't be having this sort of false vacation. I know I'm in BROILING water, but I don't even know what's going on. There's one word I can think of: Injustice. Sure, I procrastinate alot, but I need something that I can interact on my level, which is computers... that is difficult with the current restrictions in place in the Rim district that I am in. One of the said restrictions are that I cannot touch or operate a computer, or a device that is remotely part of a computer on-campus or on, and/or inside the district's property.  I mean, I CAN learn things if it was computers, but they refuse to employ techinques that could help me understand simple concepts that I can't grasp with traditional methods of teaching. It is pretty clear that every other avenue has been tried on me, and has not succeed, and the only avenues available for me is the computational methods of teaching... or they could just shove me in Juvie and be done with it. But rather, I'd prefer to be in high school. Still... I want to learn, but my mind is in a mind-set... I learn things so rapidly on computers - for instance, I learned the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol in no less than a week. Not many people can do that, IRC protocols are complicated and uses a lot of dependencies.  So... if they simply tried to employ techinques through the computer, there is a HIGH probablity that I can take to it. But now, I do not think there is a possiblity of that anymore. In other words, I think I had just screwed up my only chance.  (sigh) I'm gonna go... take care, guys...

       o_o  •  WWYD? What Would Y’all Do?    Here’s the thing:    A couple of months ago, I noticed a new dog in the backyard of the house next door. It is a lovely young yellow Lab (or so it appears to my untrained eye). Now, they have a pretty good-sized backyard; and plenty of room to run and play, yet, the dog is in a cage. Morning, noon, and night, that poor dog is in its cage. It’s probably a 6X6 cage (again, by my untrained eye) and in this cage are the dog’s food and water bowls and a little doggy-igloo thingy that I suppose is intended to provide shade or shelter or whatever. All of this is in the dog’s cage along with the dog.    I cannot say that the dog has never left that cage, I am only suggesting that I have never seen the dog outside of the cage. It is there when I get up in the morning, when I get home from work in the evening and when I go to bed at night. Even on the weekends, the dog remains locked up.    Obviously, someone is feeding and watering the poor creature and cleaning his poop out of the cage (yes, he poops in there too, which indicates to me that they are not walking him).    This is Southern California. The heat index was 90-100 degrees this weekend and, this week, it been really hot and the sun is really pouring heat. The plants there is to the point of dying and for whatever reason, the dog won’t go into its igloo (perhaps because it is painfully hot inside as there is a black material over the igloo), so it just stands there, in the sun and heat, whimpering.    It breaks my freaking heart. Every time I go outside, he peeks at me through the boards in the fence as if begging for help. He’s hot. He’s probably sick. And those dang people have a covered patio back there! If they don’t want him in the house, they could at least put him in the patio while its hot!    Why would they take this dog if they were only going to ignore it and lock it in a cage?    I would not feel comfortable knocking on these people's door and suggesting to them that they are being cruel to this animal -- they are very rednecky –- so, I am thinking about calling the ASPCA/Humane Society (anonymously); however, I don’t know if this is a situation that they could actually do anything about. I mean…can they force people to pay attention to their dog? And what if they come out and my neighbors lie and say they walk him twice a day and play with him and such?    I feel like I have to do something for this fella.    Help!

       0.0  •  Commonality & Insanity    I only watched a little of the Motorcycle Mania 3 on TV yesterday. I'm a fan of Jesse James. But that's not the point.    The little I did watch included a moment that I understood and it moved me deeply. It brought home a point that I've been thinking for quite a long time now. It's about how much more we have in common, than we differ from each other. Whatever our political leanings, philosophical views, country of origin or gender, we as humans have very much in common. Each of us as humans feels, thinks, loves, hurts, fears, desires, and dreams. We love our children, our mates, our pets. We set goals for ourselves, we work, we plan our futures, we reminisce about our pasts. We have flaws and we have fine qualities. We laugh, we cry. We identify ourselves as individuals and as part of the whole big complicated/simple, beautiful / ugly, neat / messy picture of human culture.    Hmm, thats alot of philosophical thinking... moving on.    I was having a conversation today with someone, who was relaying a story to me about going through the drive-thru of a fast food joint today and being handed back the wrong amount of change. The cashier made an error in his favor, and he ended up driving away with free food and extra money.    I just can’t do that. I always give the money back even if it means that I have to drive back to the restaurant or store. It would eat at me. My conscience, it would. I am of the opinion that it is not my money to keep. Some people are of the opinion that the extra cash is recompense for the many instances of screwed up orders and missing ketchup packets. Point taken. I’m the kind of weenie that will drive all the way back to an establishment to return their money, but will not turn the car around to complain when they get my order wrong. Others argue that lost change here and there is just the price that these places pay for hiring incompetent employees who are unable to make proper change for a twenty, even with the correct amount flashing on a screen in front of them. Point taken.    So my question to you guys and gals is this: What do YOU do? At one time or another, each of us has been faced with this situation. Do you pocket the cash or give it back? Or does it depend, for you, on whether or not the cashier was friendly?    Humor me, people...    My brother called me a little bit ago. Well, he isn’t my real brother, but my BEST friend…    He and I are pretty tight and I was ranting about a couple of things. Mostly I was expressing my case of the wiggins over finding yet another eMail from my ex-girlfriend. But I am resolved to not let it get to me.    I’ll pause here for a moment to allow you sufficient time to pat me on the back…ok, there…get off me.    But Meanie Krandle is not the point of this post. Oh no, ladies and gentleman, I have a much more disturbing agenda -- the point of this post is to make public the fact that I sat here and poured my heart out to my brother for a good twenty minutes before realizing that he had been ON THE CRAPPER the ENTIRE TIME. And some of you who are dating him need to know this!    Oh yes, dear brother, I am calling you out! I’m calling you out as a toilet-talker! A potty-prattler! A john-jabberer! A can-caller! After all, it was YOU, who called ME! Were you bored? Had you not a SINGLE THING to read in the apartment? Good God, man! Have you no shame?    There I was, chatting away ON MY LUNCH HOUR, when he actually said the words:    “Hey, can you hang on for like 30 seconds?”    “Sure, go ahead.” *nibble nibble on my sandwich*    [toilet flushing in the background] “Dude, my legs were falling asleep...”    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! That is so freaking gross!    *gag*    But in regards to my breakup to Meanie Krandle and the case of the eMail…   Particularly my most recent ex – we broke up quite recently...    Yesterday morning I checked out my eMail to find a email attachment tucked under the chaotic mass of my eMail's masses. Actually, it was two eMails sealed in a encrypted ZIP because my ex knew I'd be able to crack it.    And a happy Sunday to you too...    After couple of hours of decryption scripts and programs… I finally got it to open up. The first eMail read, "Thank you for the card. I don't like you," and contained three smaller images inside, the covers of which were art prints that she knew I would like. The second card read, "Thank you for the year. I think about you constantly. I dislike you more,"    This isn’t the first time she does this, you know. Oh yes! She has left little notes for me in Yahoo! Instant Messenger or in my eMail mailbox since our break-up... one and half weeks ago. She leaves me alone for several days at a time only to resurface in the form of annoying little disdaining notes - digital reminders of her existence. The last time she did this was yesterday…I think. I have never responded. I always just throw them away. Deeeeeleted!    This one however, has me baffled. I don’t know what to make of it.    I didn’t do anything to her. As a matter of fact, I never, in the history of our ALMOST one-year relationship, do anything to her. Nor have I contacted her in any shape or form since the day of our break-up…over a week ago.    Perhaps this is a ploy to get a rise out of me. To get me to respond. To call her - not gonna happen. Or perhaps someone (maybe her psycho friend) persuaded her to do this and she actually thinks that it is gonna make me mad and beat her up. A bit far-fetched, perhaps, but I just don’t know what to think.    IT’S BEEN OVER A FREAKING WEEK, FOR CRAP’S SAKE!    I have been joking about this the last couple of days, mostly to mask my annoyance and the fact that I am more than a just little creeped out. I feel like my personal "bubble," if you will, has been violated. There is no address on these eMails – there never is. This girl, whose welcome expired…over a week ago, physically typed up these eMails and deposited these items in that encrypted ZIP file, and then sent them to my eMail.    In retrospect, I realize that I should not have even opened the file|email. That I should have – and will from now on – shred them, unopened. I am allowing this person whom I cast out of my life, for valid reasons, rule my emotions. No more of that, I say.    It would be easy for me to say that I am annoyed and upset because she caused me to be annoyed and upset, when in fact, I am annoyed and upset because I have allowed her to make me feel this way. What ticks me off the most is that I recognize this error in myself and yet I continue to let it bother me.    Enough about my ex...    I have reached that proverbial fork in the road. The fork though, interestingly enough, rests on my head and my hair is wrapped around it like so much spaghetti.    I have been floundering for weeks now about what to do with the mop on my head. The length of my hair has reached the awkward state in which it is too long to be short, and yet too short to be long.    My hair, normally short to just "good” enough to spike up, sprouted like a Chia Pet watered by my indecision, and is now dangling precariously just above my ears. It grows incredibly fast, you see. A fact that I like to attribute to the beehive of activity going on in my head, which causes my hair to be shoved through my scalp as my brain swells with brilliance; and not to some sort of conspiracy contrived by the manufacturers of whatever gel my mom buys (usually ICE) plops on my head and swears is just a gel.    Should I cut it? I like it short. I enjoy being able to just tuck it behind my ears and be done with it. And it is almost summertime (though, judging by our 75-85 degree weather here, you would have thought that summer started about a month ago). And I like being able to just slap my cap on my head and not worry about my hair sticking out all over the place.    That, my friends, is the long and the short of it, and I still have no idea what I will do.    Ch-ch-ch-Chia! Take care guys!

       «.»  •  But I still wonder, what's it got to do with everything, life... me?    I have mixed feelings about the weekend. Bad news towards the end of it. However, Saturday was fun and should spring even more events in the future that I am definetely looking forward to.    (Sigh). This year is crap. However, it's getting a little tiring for myself to post all the challenges this year has brought on. But there definetely has been and there still is a world of things going on beyond what appears here. But I guess it's the stubborn and lazy part in me that's refrained from posting further about my struggles.    My need to take the reins of every situation, shuffle and zimmer 'em down has a little to do with that. I will overcome this in time. There is no other way. The medieval in me has come out in full force and some butt is going to be kicked and names will be taken along the way too. It's just hard to see the end of the tunnel sometimes though.    Moving along, last night, I was talking to a friend about a movie,   Chronicles of Riddick  . She said... "What the heck, I'll give it a shot. Then crap... I shouldn't have given it a shot. The cinemography is great, the story lacks. And Vin Diesel can't act to save a movie, less an action packed, big budget flick like CoR." I can't say I can agree with her... I've never seen it in the first place.    But hey... I have more pondering thoughts than about movies or enterainment... I'll try to post 'em right here...    What one does in the present reflects days, months or years later? There is in fact a saying that states something to the effect of "your future is tied to your past." This is true but only to an extent. Life is a butterfly effect. However, just like any effect, if one action is greater than another, the first will persevere. Is the lesser still felt though? Absolutely, but the stronger action will resonate further of course.    Year after year, good and bad situations occur to everyone. There are times I'd just like to reach the future out there, be it good or bad, and confront it at once. I am not sure why. But I suppose this is just like other things in life and how I feel about them.    For instance, subtlety comes to me easily although, I do not attempt its use as often to my advantage as I could. Somehow, I've always had the ability to look at someone in the eye and tell if they are full of themselves. I'll read it in their words too, in their actions, in their likes and dislikes, their ability to appreciate things in this world, tenants in this life. It isn't difficult at all to me to make such an obsveration about anyone.    This is where my lack of subtlety comes in. Once I spot someone rather voidsome, I don't want to spend any time with them, be it through sharing words or being around their presence. Which I suppose it makes for confusing situations because in my attempts to be subtle, I will try not to tell them just how voidful I think they are.    There are a great number of folks out there that are complete voids. But such is life that we must still learn to get along with each other for the sake of this world. So I go on, and try to live by such tenant, but deep inside I constantly scan them like a lion scans its prey while it walks unaware in the Africa landscape on a cool and windy spring afternoon.    Maybe just as well... I'm going to get some sleep. Take care, guys...

        urlLink  Water...      Water is also a bit of a bipolar element. While necessary for life, it can take lives. Drown, you die, but drink, you live. It's a fascinating concept.  Those of the water element are usually passive, but when angered can strike quickly. You should not be underestimated. For the most part, you may appear to be quiet and calm, but on the inside, you could be boiling. You may have problems controlling and hiding your emotions. This is okay.   urlLink What element best decribes you?

      Howdy... I was just thinking about how pathetic my existence is. Perhaps I don’t have a meaning to my life or I’m just a little behind on getting my act together to be like the rest of the world.  I was going into the kitchen when I noticed my sister posing in front of the mirror earlier and it looks to me as if she’s going to be having her date tonight. Here’s the kicker: She’s 11. I had no dates at all up until I was younger 16. And the final kick to the butt is that last night... me and Kendle broke up.  Maybe I’m not trying hard enough? Maybe there is something about me that makes everyone see me as ‘just a friend?’ I’ve never felt so low, so sad. This is pretty pathetic. I guess in the meantime, I'll just keep searching... combing the earth for the right person.   Addition : You know, I was just thinking because someone brought up the pictures from my past. When I look at them, I see this happy Dustin, one who loves people and himself. But when I soul search and think about life and reality, I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel how I look. Why? Is this a test? What is the reason for it all? Why is God putting me through this? Oh well, just wanted to add that final thought and pondering questions.

      There are currently three issues in my life right now that are on the front line giving me some major stress. Which is why I haven't been posting lately... I really need to take a chill pill or something and just relax, but this stuff is getting to me big time. Here comes the basic run down of how things are happening here...  (1) Kendle – Alrighty, so I’ve finally met someone that gives me some major love feelings that are totally new to me. I’m having an overload on trying to handle the way I’m feeling. I don’t wanna steam roll the issue and ruin anything that there might be, but at the same time the anticipation of finding out if she has feelings for me that are the same is killing me. I am going to try and relax and set my mind free of anyone but this is starting to get the best of me. I guess though, for Kendle, she can have the best of me.  (2) School – In my IEP meeting, I have to take summer school or I will be out of High School, literally... and I'm also visiting Tony in Seneca, South Carolina so thats alot of things in a short time. And my work has slowed to a standstill, so I'm not making as much money and hours as I'd like to make. Thus my monentary savings has gone down very considerably, and I want to make as much money in this time space as to pay back my debts to different people... I will fix things though!  (3) Family – Well, this has been an ongoing issue right now. My family isn't as close as I'd like to be. I went to Kamanaka's (Sam's) family grad party, and I've been noticing that most of the family had close ties and I wish I had that. And I suspect my mom's side of the family doesn't like me or my mom, sister. Basically of because of what happened in the past, foster home, and such.  So, I am kinda closeting myself for the family's benefit. I guess we take it day by day and see what comes of it, eh?  Basically, how this works is (1)+(2)+(3)=(Breakdown). Heck, item number one has done a number on me since I first met her. I guess I simply need to take a chill pill and a breather and collect my thoughts and whatnot. I will just let life roll its course and try to enjoy the ride.  I guess that really about takes care of anything that I could discuss with my life right at the moment. I really really really need to take a break. Heck, I’m not physically tired right now; I’m just flat out emotionally wore down. I hope I sleep good tonight or tomorrow is going to be the longest day of my life.  Please keep me in your thoughts...... and prayers... Take care, guys...

      (sigh) Me and Kendle aren't doing good, we're kinda on the verge of a either, a breakup, or a break. It doesn't feel good at all... all this coupled with this morning's IEP meeting. I don't know what'd happen then. My mind tells me to breakup with her, but my heart says stay with her. I love her way too much.  (sigh) I have to go, so I'll make a blog when I get back. Take care, guys...

        -_-  •  The Old Phone     This'll touch your heart.......   This is one nice story.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.     The Old Phone     When I was quite young, my father had one of the first telephones in our neighborhood. I remember the polished, old case fastened to the wall. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination when my mother talked to it.    Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person. Her name was "Information Please" and there was nothing she did not know. Information Please could supply anyone's number and the correct time.    My personal experience with the genie-in-a-bottle came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. Amusing myself at the tool bench in the basement, I whacked my finger with a hammer, the pain was terrible, but there seemed no point in crying because there was no one home to give sympathy.    I walked around the house sucking my throbbing finger, finally arriving at the stairway. The telephone! Quickly, I ran for the footstool in the parlor and dragged it to the landing. Climbing up, I unhooked the receiver in the parlor and held it to my ear. "Information, please" I said into the mouthpiece just above my head. A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear. "Information."    "I hurt my finger..." I wailed into the phone, the tears came readily enough now that I had an audience.    "Isn't your mother home?" came the question.    "Nobody's home but me," I blubbered.    "Are you bleeding?" the voice asked.    "No," I replied. "I hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts."    "Can you open the icebox?" she asked.    I said I could.    "Then chip off a little bit of ice and hold it to your finger," said the voice.    After that, I called "Information Please" for everything. I asked her for help with my geography, and she told me where Philadelphia was. She helped me with my math. She told me my pet chipmunk that I had caught in the park just the day before, would eat fruit and nuts.    Then, there was the time Petey, our pet canary, died. I called, Information Please," and told her the sad story. She listened, and then said things grown-ups say to soothe a child. But I was not consoled. I asked her, "Why is it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end up as a heap of feathers on the bottom of a cage?"    She must have sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, "Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in."     Somehow I felt better.    Another day I was on the telephone, "Information Please." "Information," said in the now familiar voice. "How do I spell fix?" I asked.    All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was nine years old, we moved across the country to Boston. I missed my friend very much. "Information Please" belonged in that old wooden box back home and I somehow never thought of trying the shiny new phone that sat on the table in the hall. As I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood conversations never really left me. Often, in moments of doubt and perplexity I would recall the serene sense of security I had then. I appreciated now how patient, understanding, and kind she was to have spent her time on a little boy.    A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about a half-hour or so between planes. I spent 15 minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived there now. Then without thinking what I was doing, I dialed my hometown operator and said, "Information, Please."    Miraculously, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well.  "Information."    I hadn't planned this, but I heard myself saying, "Could you please tell me how to spell fix?"    There was a long pause. Then came the soft spoken answer, "I guess your finger must have healed by now."    I laughed, "So, it's really you," I said. "I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time?"    "I wonder," she said, "if you know how much your call meant to me. I never had any children and I used to look forward to your calls."    I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and I asked if I could call her again when I came back to visit my sister.     "Please do," she said. "Just ask for Sally."    Three months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered, "Information." I asked for Sally.    "Are you a friend?" she said.    "Yes, a very old friend," I answered.    "I'm sorry to have to tell you this," she said. "Sally had been working part-time the last few years because she was sick. She died five weeks ago."    Before I could hang up she said, "Wait a minute, did you say your name was Paul?"    "Yes." I answered.    "Well, Sally left a message for you. She wrote it down in case you called. Let me read it to you."    The note said, "Tell him there are other worlds to sing in. He'll know what I mean."    I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant.    Never underestimate the impression you may make on others.    Whose life have you touched today?     Why not pass this on? I just did....    Lifting you on eagle's wings. May you find the joy and peace you long for.    Life is a journey .. NOT a guided tour.    I loved this story and just had to pass it on. I hope you enjoy it and get a blessing from it just as I did.

       X.X  •  Routers &amp; Computer Hell    There is a tradition around my house... When one thing breaks, it tends to lead to serveral other things breaking. This time it was the DSL stuff.    Yesterday morning, I get up early and decide to take routers to inspect and upgrade the firmware. Turns out that it failed the inspection because it was mostly corrupt. So, we went to a local RadioShack here in Seneca where we could get a replacement WAPR (Wireless Access Point Router). Today I got up early and drove it down to the ground.... So, the wireless part of the network got fixed and $95.00 later, it passed my strenous inspection.    After I found out that my WAPR had failed my inspection, I’d decided to do something with the wired part of the network. a collision indicator kept illuminated when I began driving TCP/UDP packets to a old "tester" server on the network. So, it turns out that the reason the collision indicator was on was because the cabling was causing corrupt data go even corruptier. My switch with that collision incidator could've shorted out with all that corrupted data, it kept on trying to decrypt and reassemble it correctly, thus it could've overheated and died. So I had to go and get a new CAT5e cable, 5 footer.    Also yesterday, my friend, Tony, has a old computer that currently runs Windows 98SE, and it has a Celeron 400MHz processor and the kicker is: it has 64 megs of RAM. Horrible! So I'm trying to reinstall Windows 2000 on it. But its complaining that the network card isn't there at all. The computer decides to up and go... and delete the drivers for it! So, I had to reinstall drivers.    I guess you could say it’s been hell around my house for dealing with the systems and equipment this week. All in all though, things are great again. I wonder what is next to go wrong. :-P    Until next time, take care! Dusty.

       X.x  •  Catching Up...   Kennedy Space Center, the eagle has landed! I promised a catch up session today, didn’t I? Alas, here I am following through with that promise. I’m such a good boy, I keep my promises!  Well, I’m going to be moving this friday, this was postponed from June 28th because I took summer school. I had to complete two semesters of Physical Education because I slacked off in the previous year. But I'm getting ALOT of credits in the process. That’s gonna be a awesome thing. My teacher during summer school was so awesome. We did nothing but games, which is cool.... volleyball, basketball and such.  Anyways.... enough about school...  Moving into a different world, so to speak. Seneca, South Carolina would be a equalvent of a foreign country to me as I've never been out of state ever.  This weekend, Kristina, also my best friend, has let me to go with her to The Block in Garden Grove, CA... and I get to stay with her the weekend before I leave for South Carolina. So this week and the next two months promises to be the most fun! So, this would be a sort of a vacation. I need that kind of vacation anyhow.  In deep futuristic thoughts, there might be me and some friends going to rock out at a pool party, but that’s not a definite plan. Sounds like loads of fun so, yeah, I wanna do it. Speaking of my mom... She found the site. :) *waves to mom if she’s reading this*  I guess that about wraps up this little catch up session. I’m going to try to stay active on here more than I have been.  Until next time, Dusty.

        Let Oo Of The Past       Why is it so hard for some people to let go of the past? It's not as if it can be changed. It's over. It's history. Granted, it is wise to study it, learn from it, and install safeguards to protect from repeating mistakes. Fine. Do that. But then move on.      On a deeper level...      Thought is energy, arguably the most powerful energy. That which receives the focus of our thoughts, our energy, gains power. The powerful becomes our reality. The amazing thing is ... the choice of what receives the focus of our thoughts and energy is entirely ours to make. Fail to choose wisely, giving power to past issues, and we'll meet with present day anxiety and fear. Go overboard and we'll be consumed by that fear, even paralyzed by it, unable to see what is beautiful around us. Fail to realize our mistake in time and the beautiful around us will flee. But if we instead choose wisely, gifting the energy of our thoughts to the tomorrow we desire, that gift will be returned to us.      This all ties into the related concept of taking responsibility for our own happiness. But I'll save that for another entry shortly.
