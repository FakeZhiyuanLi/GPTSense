      I just wanna let you know that whatever I do, its not just jealousy of whatsoever...  I wanna influence you, I wanna step into your life and make changes together...  A ring has special significance when its worn on certain fingers... I just wanna be in that place in your heart...  I hope that is not asking too much...

      Being protective is a natural instinct... but when does it becomes possessive... How  is moderation regarded in terms of protective... I really wanna know...  Freedom is necessary in every relationship... I dun wanna tie you down, but when does it becomes a restriction and when does it become negligence... I really wanna know...  Compatibility is an issue which appears over time... some people get together to find a substitute... some people get together cos others tell them that they should... some others get together because of lust... there are others which get together because they feel comfortable with each other... others, may be a combination of some of the cases above...  Do not ever think that you are not compatible with someone as everyone should stand an equal chance... since you are here now, you dun even need to think of whether you are compatible with me cos I dun wanna lose you...  Something that just appeared in my mind... Even if I have to face you every single second of my life, I will never get sick of looking at you cos you are my dear...  Objective: Treat you so good until you cannot be without me...

      How happy I was to be in the midst of the music, playing the trumpet again... but then all that was running through my brain was how much I would miss you these 2 weeks, what we can do this sat when I come out... sianz... how I wish our time together would never have any interruptions...

      I did not receive any replies via sms... was just thinking where you could be... no reply last night too... are you taking me for a joyride???... Sometimes I just wonder why flirts are so much more attractive then the ordinary others... gals prefer them more... cos they are more interesting???.. They can satisfy more of their needs???... I wonder...
