          MP3 is finally in the dictionairy( one of the few words in it not to have vowels).....along with a host of  urlLink new words .  It's about time.      Well Ladies and Gents.....last night was awesome, it was like old times. Steph, Bek, Hannah, Jon and I went and ate at panera then saw shrek 2 at the nova 8....the food was good, I had already seen the movie. I'm not a big fan of nova 8, but hey i got to be loud and obnoxious and it was fun.       Despite recent "problems," things have been going great for me. I've got to hang out with old friends and I've been able to make new ones. My senior year is about to start soon and I am ready to graduate. There are other reasons things are going great to.....maybe ill talk about those next week sometime, so keep checking back.      Contrary to popular belief, I am not funny all the time, I do get serious some times. It's awful to have people hang around you and talk to you just so you can amuse them. I am not some monkey. I'd like to think I am a pretty well rounded guy who is fairly intelligent and likes to have fun, but some people are like..."yeah we can have an intelligent conversation.....later....now make me laugh." Hey if you only know the funny side of Kratzer, then you only know half of me. Oh well.....life moves on....      Btw....If you read this reguarly....let me know...leave a comment                There is no defence, against pointed arrogance.  You've got want it, Youve got to want it......                        -Geddy Lee

NOt to say I'm not sad but she shouldnt have strung me along.  Yo Sobrevivir.  I played bass over at highland avenue tonight which is fun.  I helped steph pack boxes and went to eat with some friends.  I also talked to Laura (Lodine).  I havnt talked to her in a while so i was glad i got to.  She's moving into faulkner saturday so she'll be a lot closer.  We talked for a while, and she told me we could hang out so that'll be good since i havnt seen her in a while......I need to go....peace

      Wow, looks like I wont have much competition in my  urlLink computer science class      Laura and I are now official and Tonight could not have been better, Laura came with me to church tonight, so she got to hear our youth praise band play, Then we went to highland avenue for a few minutes.  We then went to faulkner and sat out on the swing that we first met on and just sat together....but then...sadly...I had to go home.   She is such an awesome girl.  She has the most sweet loving spirit.....yay.  Oh and school was ok too.

      This is what happens when every one and there mother decides to start making  urlLink DVD players.       Wow, things are crazy sometimes.  Today was a good day at school, except the uniforms, and the fact i went to the wrong class and had the entire office looking for me for an hour, but hey, it's me, what did you expect?  Band practice was kinda rough....Mr. Stough got really angry for like the first time ever.  He threw things and yelled....It was quite violent....but oh well.  Tonight was great though....I went to walmart.  Thats always exciting...laura also called me.  We had a wonderful conversation.  She ended up telling me that she liked me which was good because it saved me the trouble of coming out and telling her that i liked her....Wow...some things just fall into place.....life is good...       Danger is the most important fear you'll ever know; the transporting of refugees, the silent night is cold, and all the time we looked around because we were never told.....                                                                                                                                         -YES

      Check out this awesome  urlLink blog.   School starts tomorrow and im ready for my senior year to begin. Today was a wonderful last day of summer. I went to church, ate w/ my grandma for her birthday, and then to peytons church to wish him happy birthday. Then, after I got home, Laura called and said she was bored at the buiscuits game so i went and picked her up and then we went back to faulkner and sat on a swing and talked for an hour....It was awesome....and it felt really good. She and I are going to dinner and a movie friday night. I think she wants to see "little black book." It'll be good. All I have got to say is when life gives you lemons, eat them raw.....that was random.....I need to go to sleep
