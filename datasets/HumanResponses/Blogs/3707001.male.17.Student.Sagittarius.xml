      Man this weekend sucked...  Thursday when i was supposed to play ball wit those ppl, half of them never showed -_- ... like come on, its not hard to come to ball, and if something came up u should at least have the decency to call or AT LEAST explain over msn... but no, i was let down.  Later on thursday i went to work :(.  The big boss didnt close - that was a plus.  But both of the ppl in my department suddenly felt sick at the same time and left... leaving me alone to face the whole store by myself.  For those of u who dont work in groceries, facing (also referred to flatenning) means that i walk through every aisle and fix all the products so that the aisle looks like a solid wall.  After that u gotta fix the front and back displays.  With a friend and at a leisurely pace, it takes about 40 mins during on a weeknight.  I did most of it in 45, then had to face the diary department.  Man, 1 hr of absolute boredom... not cool  Yesterday, I woke up early (as usual) and turned on the comp.  I never realised how fast time flies when ur playing sc (comp game)... During one of the games, i checked the time, it said 11ish in the morn.  So i played a game or 2 more, and i check the time after what seemed like a second later and it was 2!!!  I knew that i was supposed to get ready and stuff at about 5 to go to my grandma's, but i decided that instead of taking my shower i was gonna play some FFX (my 2nd fav game ever!!!).  After about half an hour of leading Tidus through the Isle of Besaid, i feel asleep :S.  When i woke up my mom was yelling at me to make sure i was ready to leave... this was at 5:30.  So i ran in the shower, did my stuff, got dressed, grabbed the essentials (wallet, cell, MD, gum, forgot my keys >. Anyways, we finally got there at about 9.  Upon arrival, i went inside and started talking to my grandma who i hadnt seen in a year or so.  She was all proud of me going to UofT next year, and she started talking to me about life in the Phillipines (shes going there soon).  From what i remember, she supports a single parent family who lives on a hill, whom she will be visiting in the summer.  Unfortunatley, she can only bring 72 lbs of stuff and shes afraid she may be over the limit.  For each pound of stuff over u have to pay $20+!!!  Then she asked us if we ate dinner yet, we said no.  So she sent my oldest bro to get my mom to tell her that shes taking us to fish&chips ^.^  My grandparents are regulars there so my grandma called them to make sure that there still open.  While they were doing this, my eyes fell upon a white book wit those familiar words "Holy Bible" on it.  When i saw this i remembered that i lost my last one, so i asked if she had any extras.  She said that she got that white one for free at a garage sale and that i could have it -.-  After waiting in the basement and looking at my uncles living room for a while, we finally made our way to the fish&chip spot.  When i walked in, the first thing my eyes so was a kinda cute chinese girl.  My first thought was, "huh? fish & chips by asians?" and my second thought was, "that girls kinda cute..."  After a few hellos, my grandma introduced me (with pride) as the grandson whos going to UofT next year.  Then she told me that that cute asian girl was going to gr. 9 next year!!! >. Anyways, the food was good and then we went to our separate homes, and i forgot the Bible in the van :( i think its still there... at least i hope... :o  Today... boring again.  Woke up at 8 to hear my alarm play my fav BoyzIIMen cd, went to sleep for another 30 mins b4 jumping in the shower.  Did my thing, got out of the bathroom, saw it I had 2 mins to get to work, gave up on being on time, took my sweet time getting dressed, dreading another 7.5 hrs of work to come.  I left home, and got to work 15 mins late, (its only a 3 min work to work :D!!).  When i got there i saw that it was gonna be a little more fun than usual as one of the managers was on vacation and his spot was taken up by one of the younger cooler ppl.  I'll avoid boring u ppl (as if this blog isnt boring enough :P ) so I'll just say that i barely survived work without going crazy and hurting myself.  When i got home, i turned on the comp, got changed, and found out that my parents were making a return trip to granny's today.  I told them that i was too tired to go (what?! its the truth!!) so my mom had to leave me and my bro some of the lasagna that she made ^.^ When they left, i ate it, played some sc, and decide to write in my blog... and here I am...  Sadly, i will not be at church tmr as my parents stop driving me there when sunday school ends... so i wont be at church sunday morn for a long time, prolly 2 months when sunday school starts again.  I also hope to attend some weds nites at church, even tho the usual is not going down, its about time i helped out some1 other than myself!! I also gotta give Matt my FF7 & 8, great games they are (FF7 being by #1 of ALL TIME!!!!)  Anyways, i ran outta stuff to write... ........................................... Well as u can see my life is QUITE BORING!!! so if ur bored or u just wanna chill wit the "Skyrida" then call me up :D later -.-  Edit: I forgot!!!

      Yesterday, I FINALLY GOT MY GRAD RING!!! now i just need $500 to pay my parents back for it and im good.  Let's see, yesterday was fun.  After gettin my grad ring, i went wit my parents to see our future house. (we move in sept, i'll miss u paradice)  It's finally starting to look like a home, we have walls and that pink insulation thingy.  I saw my future room, looks kinda small but im sure it'll seem huge when i move in and i stop sharing a room wit my annoying little bro.  Im confident that i'll do more homework next year than this year just cuz i'll have a REAL study space now... this year i did all my homework on my bed >.  After that it was off to youth group where i joined in fellowship with my beloved BASICs... (thx for making me come Martha) It was the first wednesday for about 2 years that i went to, and alota things have changed.  They actually have all the songs in powerpoint or something and Scotty and Hans led the worship.  But the real fun part was spending time wit Matt, Martha and Ada afterwards when we were SUPPOSED to be helping Ada wit her letter... but me and Matt just talked about our video games... (sorry...).  Well, it was mostly me talking to Matt, SOMEONE who invited me didnt say a word to me... :P Afterwards, Mike said that i could get a ride wit help, and i reluctantly accepted.  What i didnt know is that their ride as already full and that he offered me the ride out of the goodness of his heart... had i known that i would've called my parents or taken the bus... but anyways, Me, scott, hans, brent, jordan, mike, trish, devon, luke (?), and the driver Pastor McNeil all fit into one van.  Devon had to sit on the floor and the whole time i kept on thinking that i took her seat and felt really guilty.  But finally i got home, ate something, talked to ppl on msn and went to sleep.  I woke up this morning and did the usual, turned on the comp.  I signed into msn and saw Jessica online.  After exchanging some words, we discovered that we shared a few friends: Will and Ada from ETCBC!!! What a small world!!! Anyways, she promised that she would come wit me sometime to something... funny cuz ppl make me promise them the same thing... It's always good to find out that there are more believers out there than u thought.  Tho i wish i found out earlier :(  I also had to select courses for UTSC today.  And after alot of confusion and research, i discovered that my university plan was ruined cuz they didnt offer an important course to me until spring session ( 1st term: Bio, chem, calc, comp sci, and linguistics 2nd term: more bio, more chem, more calc, more comp sci, and algebra :D  Today is also the first time that many of my friends are reaching ball at paradice... so far its me, simey, caspy, koo, janis, AP, and nick.  Sadly, i'll have to leave the court earlier than i would have liked to cuz i gotta go to work.  I have also discovered that my manager is closing tonite >.  ps. Anyone know good Rap/R&B songs? my list is straining :(

Sorry for all those elbows to the body and for pushing u into stuff AP.  Koo, i still got ur shorts and u got my $10.  All u guys gotta come down to my turf so that i can show u guys so paradice hospitality :D  Holly:  I only decided to go to prom 2 hrs b4 i asked u to it, but im glad that my friends changed my mind.  U were the main reason y i had so much fun. I'm sorry for: being a bad dancer, for not talking, for ruining ur corsage, for leaving u at britts...  Dont ever forget our song!!  To my BASICs:  Thank you everyone at Forward for keeping me straight.  Matt, Ada, Martha, thank you for bugging me to come to church, if it wasnt for u i dont know how i woulda ended up.  Sorry for not coming to church as often as i coulda, but plz dont ever give up on me.  SnoCamp was a blast every year (3on3 champs!!) and so was anything else we did together... Next year I'll be in C&C, but ima still try to come wit u guys to snocamp, i got a championship to defend!! Although im prolly only third string: if u ever need a friend i'll always be here.  To scott: thx for all those rides to church, u dont know how much they meant to me... one day u can pay me back for the beatings.

      Wow, I ACTUALLY have a blog acc... I seen all my azn friends having one and I was like: "oh, that must be fun..." so I tried it out ^.^  I'm still unsure y I made one... I mean, my life is quite simple: eat, sleep, play ball, some video games, work and go to school once in awhile.  And who cares enough to read MY blogs anyways? (if anyone actually does read this make a comment or something -.-)  Anyways, today was the official last day of my high school career.  It's kinda sad and all, but at least I spent it doing what I love: BASKETBALL.  I got to school at 10:30ish, played for about an hour before getting kicked out for lunch break... went to KFC to clog my arteries, and played ball for the rest of the day.  It's weird tho cuz after school, I was standing in the caf... and not wanting to leave.  I'm don't think im the sentimental type, but I was sad to see it go.  Mowat's been my 2nd home for 4 years, and now its time to move on...  During ball, i was quite surprised when one of my female friends starting lighting it up!!! We have a 2v2 challenge wit me and my friend against her and her friend... i admit i did underestimate her... but shes still not good enough to beat us :P!!! I guess it goes to show that guys should never underestimate girls in sports, even physical ones... well except full contact football... and baseball... girls got their own girly versions (flag football and hardball or something... :S)  I got my yearbook too!! (thx to everyone who signed it)  But I didn't get a SINGLE SHOUTOUT!!  I thought I musta impacted someone's life enough to put my initials... guess I was sadly mistaken... :(  My grad comment didn't get published either... but I wouldn't have shouted out anyone cuz there's too many ppl that mean sooo much to me that I knew that I would offend someone.  Well, even if I haven't changed any lives, I hope that my friends will realize that I will always be here for them when they need a friend...  For those of you who wished I had posted a grad comment, I think it mighta gone something like this: "Hey Mowat, It's been 4 gruesome years but we finally made it! But I never would of made it this far without all my friends and family who supported me the whole way.  Every friendly gesture, down to the most insignificant waves, will be remembered and cherished for the rest of my life.      "I'll take with me the memories to be my sunshine after the rain.  It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday."      -Boyz II Men"  For the 4th nite in a row my parents have left me and my older brother to find our own dinner.  It wouldn't be so bad if we had some mac & cheese here or something... but there is NOTHING in our home. :( Last nite I started playing sc (starcraft) and forgot about dinner... guess im doing the same tonite T.T.....

      Yesterday (Wednesday) was... interesting.  Well, i started off with the usual: wake up, sc, food, shower.  Then i got dressed to go to church.  But then i remembered that we're painting so i changed to something that i wouldnt mind getting dirty, namely some old jeans and an old black Nike tee.  My brothers decided to go outside and play basketball while my parents and i went to see our new house b4 dropping me off at church. As we pulled up into the driveway, we saw that our future neighbours beat us to the incomplete, rubble-ridden driveway, so we parked on the soon-to-be curb.  The drywall i think its called is up, and the rooms really look like rooms now.  My room is slowly getting smaller, but it'll by MY room nevertheless, instead of "me and my brother's" room.  I checked out my lil bro's room, even smaller than mine.  My parent's room was quite large, larger than their current room i believe, and they got a walk-in closet and their own bathroom... HOW UNFAIR!!! lol... I left after like 5 mins cuz i was kinda getting tired of going there and my parents were filling our house wit cigarette smoke :( ... 15-20 mins later, my parents finally left and we made our way to church On the way there, i feel asleep for about the last 20 mins of the 30 min trip while listen to my MD.  lol, it was funny cuz i remember dreaming i was playing basketball.  I recall some1 shooting the ball, and the ball bouncing off the rim, off the board and back to me... so naturally, i put my arms down and swing them up to gain momentum as i jump up to grab the board... just my arm swinging wakes me up just in time to see my mom turn around i say, "ur tired eh?" lol, i felt like such a looooser... but i played it off like it was nothing to my mom. Finally, at 7 on the dot i got out of the van and wave to my parents as they drive off.  I went downstairs, past the Korean ppl, past the kindergarten room, and into the gym where i met the suprised expressions of ppl who aren't used to seeing me at church wednesday nites, esp 2 in a row...  anyways, after getting a quick painting tutorial from Aaron, i went to work wit Matt and those 2 sisters whose names i cant think of rite now (sorry)... after 30 mins of intense work, i went inside the future youth room to chill wit Matt, where we talked about nothing and played "can u guess that rock band?" a game that i couldnt win if my life depended on it.  After throwing around one of those dirty large circular scrubbing pads that u put on the bottom of a buffer like a frisbee, Martha came in to give us some exciting news: SHE'S GOING TO BRAZIL!!!!!!  Ok... now for the dark side of me... If i was truly the great friend that i thought i was, i woulda been happy that everything worked out.  Cuz u see, 2 days things were looking so bad that one quoted "it would take a miracle for everything to work out", shortly followed by "but everything is possible with God"... well she was right, everything is possible and sometimes it happens!!  Sadly, being the greedy, ungrateful, horrible friend that i am... at that exact instance where she broke the news... i did not feel joy.  It's hard to say what i did feel, i definetly felt sadness, as i will miss the person who i talk to the most over msn... but, the dominate feeling was... almost anger, i dunno at who, maybe at Martha for leaving me, but... maybe at God for making everything work out... I KNOW!! I know... its SOOO greedy of me!! Like one of my most cherished friends just got the opportuinty of a life time, and here i am wondering what im gonna do during the nite!! Martha, God, im so sorry, plz forgive me... Dont worry, shorlty after those feelings i realised how horribly wrong i was in thinking that, and i praised God for sorting things out... Well, to continue with the evening, finally one of the ppl who were actually working finally got me and Matt to go back into the gym to work, but the she left herself... :S.  Martha went home but we had Ada to help our cause.  In the gym, me and Matt were "supervisors" meaning we stood there and watched, while every1 else continued to paint... i most say, it was looking fresher, newer, better in the sense that the cracks and stuff were all gone.  The colour choice, not my personal favourites, but last time Pastor Aaron tried to let us choose the colours, well come see our old youth room and find out :P Before long, some1 gave me the prestigous job of "brush cleaner"... joy... lol, i think that i am quite possibly the WORST brush cleaner in the history of Forward... it just wouldnt get clean!!! Well they didnt give me much to work with, a moderaately large sink, running water and hands -_-... no scrubbing utensil, bad lighting, and most of all a secluded location.  Anyways, at 9:30 we were done, most of the ppl had left by then, just me, Pastor Aaron, Robbie, Matt, and Aaron's sis left.  Aaron's sis left shortly afterwards, leaving just us guys.  Unfortunately, the only reason we were all there was cuz my parents, who i said to pick me up at 9:30, hadn't arrived yet, at 9:45, Aaron reluctantly told me that he had to go, despite the fact that i wanted to go since we first finished.  Being the great guy he is, he didnt wanna leave me alone, so he stayed even tho it was jepordizing his prior plans.  But just as he said that, my familiar blue Toyota Previa pulled up and every1 left happily in a flurry of waves and handshakes... On the way home we stopped by at Blockbuster where i found a great deal: $10 for Shenmue II, a great game by the way.  It has a mix of adventure and story line, but the same fighting engine from the acclaimed Virtua Fighter series, a must buy at $10 dontchya think?  when we got home, i played till 12:30ish (late for me) and went to sleep.  Today was good.  I woke up, did the usual (sc/msn) and remembered that it was Victoria day (i think its called).  I didnt have any plans so it didnt make any difference, but one of my friends invited me to a bbq, something woulda loved to have gone to but had no reasonable source of transportation as my parents had left and i wasnt sure if the buses were running (ya, i dont drive, i dont even have my G1 T.T).  Instead, i made plans wit a friend to run some sc, which he owned me in, and then some ball.  My bro ruined our sc as he unintentionally caused me to dc (disconnecnt) every 2 minutes.  At about a little before 6, he came to my door and we went to the courts.  Shortly afterwards, my brother arrived and we ran some "pump".  Most ppl dont know what pump is, but its a variation of "american" where u can perform a "put back" or alley-oop the ball in the air to steal 3 points from the person who first missed.  For the basketball unfaithful, american is pretty much every-man-for-themselves where first to 21 wins.  In american, ther person wit the best shooting or 1 on 1 skill usually wins, but pump makes the game so much more intense cuz at any moment an opponenet can gain 6 pts on u from something as insignificant as a missed shot.  Well i didn't win a single game, we played about 5 times, the last one i got to game point but my friend who was at 18 won off a pump... -_-, good times tho. During our games, some brown (no offense to ppl with the stereotypical word) ppl arrived and played on another net... lol, it musta been a family affair cuz there were at least 20 of them.  We finally challenged them, and MURDERED them, i think the score was 7-1.  2nd game, more of the same, 11-? (not more than 5 i think).  Then those ppl went to the opposite court, and we sat around talking.  10 mins or so later, they called us to their new court and challenged us, so we owned them again 11-4.  Then they got a decent team together, the game was INTENSE... they were up 10-8, their posession.  Their main play maker missed a pull jumper at the elbow and my friend crashed the board.  Im not sure what order it happend but my friend, whos prolly has prolly the best 1on1 skills amongst my wide range of ball friends, hit a sweet pull-up at about 3 pt.  Then he and I ran the old-school pick and roll, which was working beautifully all day, and i made the open lay-up :D.  So now its 10-10, win by 2 (standard rules), and 2 open shots later we won!!! YAY!!! But WOW!! the game after that we got "ruined"!!! Well the final score wasn't so bad: 11-6, but that doesnt show how we played... we were getting out rebounded horribly!! They changed their weakest player for some1 wit good height, good ups (jumping ability) and a solid drive.  My man starting playing better D and they started double teaming me in the post, forcing me to kick out to my bro who suddenly started missing the shots that he usually "wets".  I missed a 2 foot shoot, the pressure got to me... guess im still just a noob/rookie to the game... Guess practice doesnt always make perfect, u need some in-game experience to go with it.  Guess I'll be at the courts a little more often...   PS.  In case this is the last post u read i wish u bon voyage, our hearts and prayers are with u, u will be greatly missed T.T... in comemeration of ur leaving, the countdown has alrdy started here and on my msn...  35 dayz till ur back in my arms......(symbolically speaking of course)... hehe

      Here's SOME of the lyrics from my current fav song: Hope - Twista ft. Cee-lo I'd like to dedicate this song to my #1 fan Martha... ALWAYS KEEP THE FAITH!!!   "And I Wish God never gave the men power  To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)  Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,  When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh  We will never break, don't underestimate, we shall motivate,  And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.  Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,  The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.  Sit at the light so long,  And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,  So when right go wrong,  Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!  Let's HOPE!  Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,  I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,  We can make it always so optimistic,  If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,  I pray for justice when we go to court,  Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,  Why can't we kick it and just get em on,  And in the famous words of Mr. King 'Why can't we all just get along',  Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I  Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I  Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,  And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,  You can be wrong if it's you doubting,  With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,  And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,  Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!  And let's HOPE    [CHORUS] Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,  Take this music and use it  Let it take you away,  And be hopeful (hopeful) and He'll make a way  I know it ain't easy but that's okay.  Let's be hopeful!"    Heres the shortened lyrics of my fav song to sing in the shower: I swear - All4One I'd like to dedicate this to that special girl who im APPARENTLY taking to her prom... :S (they say the chorus like 5 times, one at beginning, between the 2 verses and like 2 at the end so i put it once :D)   "I see the questions in your eyes I know what's waiting on your mind You can be sure i know my part 'cause i stand beside you through the years You'll only cry those happy tears and though i make mistakes i'll never break your heart  I'll give you every thing i can I'll build your dreams with these two hands We'll hang some memories on the wall And when (and when) just the two of us are there You won't have to ask if i still care 'cause as the time changes the page My love won't ever age at all  [Chorus] And i swear by the moon And the stars in the sky i'll be there I swear like the shadow that's by your side I'll be there for better or worse till death do us part I'll love you with every beat of my heart This i swear"   Wow, it's only be a week since i started this thing and im already falling behind!! Well, it's been a few days since u last heard from me, so heres what u missed:  Sunday Missed Church :( (its not my fault really)... Well, i woke up turned on the comp, played some sc... the rest is kinda fuzzy.  I also promised a very special girl that i'd take her to her prom as a last resort, and she said that i was her first and last resort... YEA RITE!!! i can picture the last part of it but the first... naw... Also, i spent a hectic nite sorting out my timetable, its not like high school where they do everything for u, u have to first decide what u wanna do in University, look at the requirements for that program, make sure u take all the prerequistes for the later courses, and sort out when u wanna take what... THEN after that u have to check the timetable to see when the different lectures and tutorials for each course is going on, and then pick the rite ones so that nothing conflicts... whew, it was WILD!! after an hour i got the fall session done, but the winter never seemed to work, i tried changing this lecture that practical... it didnt work!!! I thought i had to drop a course but then a divine ray of light enlightened me and it was all so clear ^.^  Monday: I woke up, played some sc, and decided to go wit a friend to Fairview Mall to run some MvC2 (Marvel vs. Capcom 2) the BEST FIGHTING GAME EVER!!! Wow, it seemed like the longest bus ride ever... what seemed like an eternity seemed to only take 50 mins... lol, i struggled when i got up to tell my friend who took the bus almost everyday to fairview to get off on front of the mall, only to find out that the 85 stops INSIDE the mall at Don Mills Station, hahaha, every1 was looking at me funny, now i know why... Well when we got there, we seen some nice sales going on at Champs, Athletes World and Foot Locker, everything 70% off!!! If i had money i woulda bought something, but i didnt.  LOL, im $500+ in debt rite now, dont worry why :P!  Anyways, we finally reached the arcade at the other end of the mall and seen the the competition was already there.  When we walked in, there was a lil kid who was using some cheap characters which are looked down upon in the arcades, and an azn guy using reg characters.  After the azn won, i put in my money and died in like 30 secs!! LOL, i even accidently picked a cheap character and still got owned!! Well, after me the guy got to i think 9 wins total before my friend finally beat him and left.  Then i put my money in and owned my friend a few times, after we realised that the side my friend won on is kinda broken... the low block (which is key) wasnt working too well.  Anyways, i beat the lil kid and my friend a few times, then i gave my friend $.50 and let him beat me cuz i wanted to see him do something which he never did >. On the bus ride home my friend invited me to run some more MvC2 at his house... we were both hooked so i said yes.  On the way i bought some fattening goodness at the local MickeyD's and ate it at his house.  We got there at about 7-7:30... and we played till past 11!!!! But then my mom called and was pissed cuz it was "late" so i had to go home :(  Today: Woke up, sc/msn, some ppl came and interrupted my fun to test the fire alarms :@ who needs fire alarms anyways??!! lol, jks.  I made plans wit a friend to go to open gym at my FORMER high school (man it feels good to say that) but then realised that it's closed and decided to play ball on turf.  When stepped on the court there were like 5 kids like hitting pine cones wit a baseball bat :|, not cool, i hoped there would be some competition but there wasn't, so i started working on my game: pull-up jumpers, post game, some left-handed layups.  It was mostly pull-ups cuz thats my weakness :(.  Got home, more msn, shower and here i am... Man im hungry but my mom left again, theres leftover from lunch but... meh...  PS. Matt, we gotta chill sometime, i'd email u or comment ur log but i cant :( call/email me sometime...

      Today... was actually a good day!!!  I mean, despite the drama thats been going on the last little bit... today was good.  Earlier i posted when i woke up.  As i said then, i had to go to the dentist to get a filling.  I really hate going there, but today it wasnt so bad.  Through my mom, word got around that i was attending UofT Scarborough in the fall.  Well my dentist attended UofT as well, and he had some tips for me (nothing im gonna talk about, i need the edge :P)  After that pep talk, he left me to attend to other ppl.  I had been tired all morning, and the "Business Weekly" that was on the TV wasnt helping me.  I was just about to doze off when he returned and gave me the filling between questions and comments about university.  The whole thing took 5 mins, but i was the 30 min wait before that killed it.  Finally, my mother (who also got a filling) and I left the building and stood outside for our ride.  10 mins later we were on our way to our new house.  There, my brother and my mom went for a look inside while my stepfather and I stayed in the van.  It was quite silent in the van, not that any of us minded tho, he was reading something and i was listening to music.  15 mins later we got home.  After eating some leftovers, my parents and my older bro left my younger bro and I at home.  After starting up my msn and media player, i started messing around wit my blog template.  I didnt get too far, i widened the body part, thats about it.  Then i decided that i needed to clear my mind of what had been bothering for a while, so i went outside to run some ball.  Upon arrival, i noticed that there was not a single person at the courts or the adjacent park.  Nice... some silence is always welcome.  There i worked on my game a bit... mostly pull-ups and left-handed layups.  My jumper is coming along little by little.  I discovered some things that i didnt notice before.  Well before i get into that... heres the ideal pull-up:  Perform a cross over move of some sort, throwing ur defender off balance.  Shortly after making ur move stop on the spot, but as u do this, make sure that ur feet are lined up to the net, right foot (if ur right handed) slighltly on front of ur left, shoulder with apart.  Take a moment to collect urself and align ur shoulders to the net, then elevate straight up.  As u go up, bring the ball in ur right hand on front of ur face, slighlty to ur right, locking in ur right elbow to ur side while using ur left hand to support the ball.  On ur way up or at the peak of ur jump, release the ball, not pushing it, but stroke the ball towards the net in.  Ensure that ur shot has sufficient ark and rotation, improving ur chances of getting it in or getting a "shooter's" bounce.  To help make sure that u followed through cleanly, as u land ur hand should be above ur head, slightly tilted forward.  Now the only thing left to do is to listen to the swish of the net and the "oohs" and "ahhs" of the spectators.  That being said, i noticed some things about my shot.  Firstly, i was holding the ball too far to the right.  My elbow was somewhat locked in, but it was angled out to far.  This caused my shot not to look straight, tho it usually went in.  Not a big problem... but could result in inconsistency if i didnt hold the ball far enough to the right.  That was easy to fix. Secondly, i didnt always align my feet.  After u do a cross over, its not uncommon for ur feet to be pointing away from the net.  Well when i crossed to my left, my feet would point left.  This resulted in many bricks and air balls... not cool. Finally, i was not releasing at the peak of my jump.  When i started my ball career, i was a set shooter.  This meant that i would release the ball as i jumped, giving me more power but making it easier to block me.  I gradually developed my jumper, and have been happier ever since.  Well as i did my jumpers, i noticed that i was releasing the ball on my way up.  But i wouldnt release it at the same time every time, making my shots inconsistent.  So i started releasing the ball at the very peak, and they went in more often.  But more importantly, i didnt have to think about how much power to put, it just seemed to flow.  Well as i practiced, 3 girls started shooting on the other net.  I didnt get a good luck at them (mostly cuz my i didnt have my glasses), but they seemed really young, prolly 12-13.  So i continued to shoot around, not paying them any attention.  After an hour or so, i ran to the fountain.  I have mentioned this fountain before, but that fountain is soooo great!!! (excuse my lack of vocab)  Like, after u work up a sweat from playing all day in under the sweltering sun, nothing feels better than cooling off in the fountain.  I think i go to the courts for the ball, but stay for the fountain.  Anyways, if u ever come to visit me, the first thing i'd take u to see is the fountain.  Then i'd make u run through it with me... like lil kids.  Good thing i bring a ball to the court, otherwise those parents would look at me funny...  Well, after awhile, one of my friends from school, his bro and his cuz came and started shooting around on dif nets.  Moments later, another guy i played wit b4 came to run some ball.  We ran 2v2, me and my the 2nd guy vs my friend from school and his bro.  I started the game off weak, lost the ball, missed a few hook shots, threw some bad passes.  Before i knew it we were down 6-4.  So i stepped it up, my friend from school whos smaller than me was guarding me, so i just posted him of, drop stepped to my left and made the smooth baby hook.  After my teammate made a few baskets, i made another hook and we had game point.  At the top, they checked the ball to my teammate, he passed me the ball and i faced my man up.  As i looked around, my teammate set me a screen to my right, so i ran around it.  The guy who was defending my teammate didnt step out, so i had the open shot.  Then i set my feet, aligned my shoulders, elevated and released the shot at the peak in one smooth motion.  As soon as i shot it, i knew it was cash... so i watched as the ball floated into the net (not touching the rim), bounce off the net and roll slowly to our feet.  Another victory for Warren... tho i wasnt all that proud.  My friend from school had bad coordination, and wasnt nearly as skilled or experienced as i was (no offense).   His bro was alrite, i'd say just as good as my teammate, maybe a little better.  After running throught the fountain twice and going home to get some water, i came back to another game.  3 ppl had come, one very tall one and 2 brothers.  We started a 4v4, and i was assigned the tall guy -_-.  He was about 6'4, 200 lbs, and muscular build... kinda intimidating.  He was the most talented of the 3 ppl who came, he was slightly quicker than me, but the height advantage was the real killer.  Luckily, he was also not too quick, something i took advantage of.  Time for Warren's shooting zone...  Well, finally the game started.  I started off slow again, i missed a few layups... theres no excuse for it but that tall guy kept on intimidating me, making me afraid of getting blocked.  Then the other team was up about 8-6, and i decided to step it up.  I started running around more, giving up on playing big and concentrating on getting open.  My man underestimated my shot, so i set up on the outside waiting for the pass.  When the ball touched my hands, my mind went completely blank, it was just me and the rim, nobody else was there, no pressure.  So i took it like i did during my shoot around, releasing the ball at the peak.  I took joy when it released my hand, it felt right as soon it took flight, i knew it was money.  The next play, i set a backdoor screen for one of my teammates.  The oppenent didnt see it coming, and he got completely stopped in is tracks.  As my teammate ran around to the other side of the court, his man tried to catch up.  Then i turned towards the top and found the ball at my hands.  There was a miscommunication and no1 picked me up.  "Just me and the rim" i thought again... swish.  10-10 .  As they checked the ball, i stood under the rim, comtemplating which side to run to.  When my teammate got the ball up top, another one ran towards me, so i ran around him, attempting to mix up our defenders.  At this time my team noticed i was hot, so they got me the ball.  I stood slightly to the right of the top of the imaginary arc, dribbling the ball casually while keeping my head up as to not miss any easy passes into layups.  Screen left, i ran around, my man got caught behind.  As i ran just inside the elbow, i stopped on a dime, set my feet, and hit a clutch pull-up-almost-fadeaway jumper... nothing but air (we dont have meshes >.  After a 30 min break, having 2 ppl join us, and after me and the guy who guarded me were assigned captains and chose teams, the rematch was ready.  But this time i started on fire.  After running from one baseline to the opposite one, i was open for a shot.  No hesitation... another point.  2 or 3 big open jumpers and my team was up.  My 1st draft pick was also playing well, he had an usual fake which seemed to keep on working.  A few points later my team won another close game.  3 vics.  The person who sat out the last game took off IMO the worst player on the other team.  He wanted to play wit my #1 pick so he and my worst player switced.  As soon as the game started i could feel the rhythm my team had going the last game disappearing.  I was the hot shooter, but that didnt stop the new guy from jacking up some ugly bricks... one went in tho, off glass... fluke.  I continued running around trying to get open as i did in the last 2 games.  Finally i did got an open shot.  I missed it, but that wasnt what bothered me.  As i landed, i noticed that i ever so slightly pulled my left calf.  It didnt bother me too much, but the next shot i took and missed magnified it 2x.  My man, who is a tough cookie to stop, decided to drive and lay it up over me.  I did what i could: stayed with him as best i could and jumped as i put my hand in his face.  As i landed, my left calf hurt worse.  This came down to the wire.  10-10 again... win by 2.  We had exchanged a point or so when my teammate gave us the lead with a runner in the lane.  My man was getting fustrated and he switched with his friend.  THANK YOU!!! Some1 small!!!  As soon as the ball was checked i set up in the post.  The ball handler made a good feed to me and i started to back my defender down.  As i gained a few inches, he started to push harder on my back.  All going to plan.  I made one last push to the rim, and my man pushed back.  As soon as i felt this, i dropped my left foot behind his feet.  Then i spun off him, using his own pressure on my back to throw him off balance.  I was off balance too, but it was a shot i was used to.  Elevation... then i smooth one handed follow through... and the game was ours!!!  But as i went up i felt a slight twitch in my right calf.  As i came down that tickle turned into excruciating pain... tho it wasnt as bad as SnoCamp.  My team started to celebrate while i leaned against the fence in pain.  Finally some1 asked what happened, and i told them between grunts of pain that i pulled my calf.  Sadly my friends who had just arrived had next game, but i couldnt play against them.  O well, i was happy 4.5 hrs of ball, 4 wins, but most importantly... i got my mind off what was bothering me all day.  Not that i dont care about it, but during a ball game, u havta concentrate if u wanna win.  U have to always keep ur head up, looking out for open cuts, screens on teammates or set by them, defensive miss-matches, open shots... everything.  But i felt at peace the most when i got the ball for an open shot.  Nothing matters, just me and the rim... one fluid motion... clean follow through.  That time, when u are at  that complete peace, cannot be replaced.  U are not concentrating on anything but the game during the game... unless u wanna lose.  Everyone has to be on top of the game, even the slightest slip could cause the game.  Anyways, i accomplished what i wanted... i was happy.  After painfully limping my way home, i got on the comp.  I opened my blog and then my template.  I wanted to customized it, to make it seem more personal, something that better reflected me... i changed a few things in the end: my font, how wide it was, the "posted by" comment, and that pic up top ^.^... all i need to do is find a good background colour, a good font colour to go wit the background, a border around the body, and possibly some links to my friends sight.  But now that i've said everything that comes to mind, I cant help but think about that problem.  In my eyes it shouldnt be a problem, but ppl are... well... human.  I need not say more...  Hopefully my upbeat mood will last through the night... *sigh* who am i kidding...

      Saturday morning... and i was up at 8!!! U havent missed much since my last post, but whatever did happen is a blur to me cuz of something else that is constantly on my mind.  Heres what i can piece together:  Thursday: I went to work at 3,  worked till 5 until my manager left, took a 45 min break on front of a camera >.  Friday:  Woke up at 7....??!!  Ya, something was on my mind.  I responded to an email, talked to some friends... read stuff... ate some small leftover salad for lunch... still had cravings... had some chocolate fudge ice cream (mmmmmmm.....).  Then i got really bored and went upstairs to catch up on lost sleep.  I couldnt sleep so i listened to my B2M cd as i sang along... still couldnt sleep so i started my Usher cd.  I think i dozed off a few times then.  Hmmm... i think i went downstairs for a sec, then returned to my bed and listened to my MD as i felt asleep.  Something woke me up.  I tried to dl some songs, failed... jumped in the shower, sang some songs (wit some1 on my mind)while i was there. Then i got dressed for work, left home, and got there late again.  My dept manager was closing that day so no messing up!!  It was a struggle cuz there was nothing important to do, combine that with trying to impress ur boss and u've got a struggle.  Did everything by the books, 15 (prolly 20) min break... no food T.T .  I did all my work so i picked up the slack for some1 else.  Then we faced the store (gave me time to think...) and i went home.  When i got home i was soooooo hungry.  Luckily my parents left me food.  U shoulda seen it, i practically inhaled that food.  It was dry so i ate it with my hands... faster than a fork :P .  I started an email then stopped when i talked to some1.  Wanted to explode... and went to sleep.  This morning:  I woke up at 8.  I have a dentist appt at 12, getting a filling (maybe).  Guess i dont take good enough care of my teeth... nothing to do after... if u see this in time then feel free to call me after 2 i guess... i'll prolly be really bored and doing nothing.  Or ball... good ol' ball...  AHH!!! I forgot the countdown... T.T ... im such a bad friend... here it is again:  [26]....... :D  This has been my shortest post in awhile.  The last one i wrote was based on a morning, this one i had 2 days of quality material to use... but i cant think.  Don't worry about me... I should be able to resolve (if thats the right word) it in the next few days.  Hmm... I hate the dentist... lol, i was considering becoming one too!!! They dont get long, awkward hours, and they get great teeth!!  Wow... i cant elaborate on anything... i think i'll just go now... do something... maybe get some more sleep...  See y'all later :D

      It's been less than a day since i lost blogged.  I usually dont do write this often, but this morning was to much for me to hold in.  Everything was going just how i imagined it before this morning.  I felt as tho i was in complete control.  I was an ocean liner taking a cruize of the Caribbean... everythings going good.  How wrong i was.  What seemed like an ocean liner was really me drifting in my dinghy.  Small and fragile, where the smallest gust of wind could top me over.  Well today, i hit more than a gust of wind, i hit a storm.  I was just cruizing along, having a friendly convo.  This person wouldnt believe me about something i said, so i reinforced it with the best example i could use, not even considering the possibilites or the consequences.  Well the last thing that i could've expected to happen happened, creating a storm of emotions.  No details here, but i simply could not find the words to say.  Did i stop? No.... i asked another question, and got the only fitting answer to finish the convo.  At this point, it was too much, I had to leave, I had to run away... even if it was just for a moment. So i signed off and went upstairs throwing myself and other things around my room, trying desperately to cope... finally i just sat on my bed, back to the wall, and put my head down.  I was so lonely, i needed some1 around me, so i called up my friend and we went to MickeyDs. I called him up half way to his house, he lives on the way so it only makes sense i pick him up.  As i saw him, i put on a fake smile and acted like everything was ok.  I wanted to tell him everything, but i was happy enough just having some1 to talk to about anything.  When we got there, we were about to order breakfast, but while we were thinking they changed to their lunch/dinner stuff.  We were both to shy to order now, so we ended up just sitting in MickeyDs just chilling, talking to some1 else who works there.  LOL, one of the employees tried to sell us a coupon, it was good too, i woulda bought it if i had money.  Big Mac combo for $3!!! Anyways, we left, went to Mr. Sub next door to get some healthier food.  My friend ask for my recommendation, i said Louisiana Chicken.  We both got one, and i got an assorted for my mom (i knew she'd be mad if i didnt get her anything).  On the way back, i asked a simple question, something to help me out.  Sadly, he gave me the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  All that did was make me 2nd guess my morals and values.  On the other hand, the food was good.  Finally, i got home.  I wanted to talk to that friend, but he/she was gone.  It's funny, i ran away before, and all i wanted to do was talk to this person now.  O well, that email will have to do.  On the bright side, something tells me that it might not be as hard as i thought... if all goes well.  Yes, u cant tell through this very unspecific blog, but it was a storm.  Although it didnt seem like it at the time, going through the storm was all worth it... getting thrown around barely surviving in my dinghy was worth it, to see that beautiful sunset in the end...

      Again, you have come to this page hoping to read of some exciting happenenings, only to be disappointed... but here it is anyways:  Monday: nothing exciting, SC, msn, ShenmueII, CS (counterstrike)... too lazy for ball, too lazy to go to grandma's... nothing sticks out about monday, just another mediocre day in my mediocre life.  Tuesday: I woke up and read a heart-warming e-mail from a good friend.  I replied, then sc/msn to lunch.  Ate something, played CS, then took a shower and went to work.  Immediately after arriving at work 7 mins late >. Afterwards i went home, played sc and went to bed.  LOL, weirdest thing happened.  I make my nightly prayers in bed (when i remember >. I usually listen to music after my prayers too.  I've always had an admiration for the creativity of rappers, and i started going through my few rap songs listening for particularliy good lyrics... Here's what i remember (excuse the language):  Lloyd Banks - Warrior  "Uh, You heard right mothafucka  My grandmama' daughter ain't raised no sucker  Heart full of pride and a head full of anger  Attitude of a winner infared for the danger  Even the paranoya of a female'll change ya  Waking up every morning laying next to a stranger  I'm on the move, smooth, with one eye out for the snakes  Who can't stand hearin your name all throughout the states  Tune into BET and watchin your video  Pretending to be your friends but the smart ones really no, so  If that's your man warn him  'Cause there's enough bullets in here to hit every NBA patch on him "  Nuff said, Lloyd Banks is crazy!!! I esp enjoyed the part about the NBA patches.  For those of u who don't know, about a year ago (in Canada at least), somebody made a jean outfit wit patches from every NBA team... it consists of a jacket and jeans.  This is a good lyric cuz it not only sounds good (dl that song), but it also shows that he truly knows whats going on in the "hood".  Fat Joe & Terror squad - Lean back  "Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the **** I call a chain reaction."  Self explanitory, though it was ripped from another artist, Jay-Z i think...  Kanye West - Jesus Walks  "I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus So here go my single dog radio needs this They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh? Well let this take away from my spins Which will probably take away from my ends Then I hope this take away from my sins And bring the day that I'm dreaming about Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out (Jesus walks)"  True, isn't it?  Finally, i feel asleep.  Today: woke up, read another heart-warming email from a friend.  It took me till 11:5? to reply, and i was supposed to be at the court at 12.  So i didn't eat lunch and went straight to the court.  As soon as i stepped out, i noticed that it just rained.  I was like, "God, plz dont ruin my ball game on my only day off this week...".  When i got on the court, i noticed that it was slowly drying, so i helped it out by kicking out those puddles so that they can dry faster.  After like 20 mins or so of shooting around, Simey and Caspy arrived, shortly followed by Jan, Koo and AP.  We played 3on3, me and the Szymcak bros gainst Jan, Koo and AP.  We won twice i believe... or maybe 1 long one.  But during the last or only game, Kendra appeared and stretched out as we finished the game.  But now we had 7 ppl, so i called up Nick.  He arrived, quicker than usual, and we ran 4on4: Me, Kendra, Nick & Jan vs Koo, AP, Simey and Caspy.  We won once.  Then i went to the fountain, noticed that the drain was being clogged by a plastic bag, drenched my shoes as i fetched it out and let it drain so that it could regain its sprayful glory.  Returned to the game, won again.  Jason arrived mid game and Koo subbed out for him (what a nice guy).  After that game the fountain was its usual self.  So i ran in and drenched my face and hair.  O man doing that in the hot sun (which came out, Thanks God) is priceless...  then we played our last game.  It was intense.  We started hot, but then the other team came back.  At this point i was exhausted, but i forced myself to D up and crash some boards.  I missed so many lay-ups... i HATE missing them, i dont care if their whole team is on me, no excuse... anyways, after a bit, my friend hit game winner from past 3 pt.  As soon we won i ran straight to that fountain, and drenched my face again.  Usually i sit at the side after, but instead i sat right where the water lands after being sprayed.  LOL, i was drenched from head to toe at the end,  but it felt sooooo good.  All my friends were looking at me funny, but it was cuz they were too shy to join me.  I had such a good time, not just cuz of the ball, but cuz i got to chill wit my friends who i prolly wont see very much in the summer.... (reminisces... feels sad... wishes it didnt have to end...) We gotta do that again sometime!! :D  Afterwards, me and Nick went to the store and got a drink.  We both got a Grace brand pineapple juice.  If u ever see it get one, they're the best!!!  It's a jamacain style drink, good stuff.  We payed a dollar, but i seen some other places for less.  they taste so good, and are healthy than pop. When i got home, i gave my friend a cd i never listened to, and took a nice long shower.  I love taking a shower, esp when i have my fav song to sing to playing.  Ya know what else is good, the occasional icy blasy of water after playing ball.  It feels so good... for a moment, then its too cold and the hot water comes back.  After ending it with some soothing cool water, i got out, got into some dry underwear ^.^, and started this blog.  My family got some $50 dollar coupon to Tucker's Marketplace, so halfway through this i left, got some food, returned... and here i am... finished!! :D

      Hmmm... havent missed much in my life, but here goes nothing:  Friday: Woke up, sc/msn, played some more ShenmueII... till before work.  LOL, i was late for work cuz i was gambling in the game... somethings will never change i guess. But i did find a certain win gambling booth, so i guess its not gambling if u cant lose... :S Anyways, went to work late, my department manager closed -_-, and it was just me him and some old guy i dont talk to working, man was it boring!! Ate chef boyardee beef ravoli for dinner, felt sick 15 mins later, worked it off by the end of the shift.  Got home, more of the same stuff, slept for work...  Saturday: Woke up at 8:40 to get rdy for work at 9!! >. I got home, did some sc/msn/ShenmueII and went to sleep.  Today:  ALL DAY... sc/msn/ShenmueII... Well i watched "Not Another Teen Movie", kinda funny, but that was it.  I was too lazy to go to ball, too lazy to go wit my parents to my grandmas, but i have no regrets.  Oddest thing happened tho, outta nowhere some guy added me to his msn.  I accepted, asked who it was, and asked if it was a joke.  Turns out the guy who added me was really looking for his friend, and they both live in Australia.  Usually i delete and block right away, but i talked to him.  Here's what i know: he's 17, dropped outta school to work at MickeyDs to help mom wit bills, was on vacation wit his gf and his mom.  He and his gf were both there, sometimes switching who i was talking to, they're both really in love, and are getting married in 4 years (they invited me to their wedding ^.^).  The guy wants to own a recording company and the girl wants to go into interior design.  then i added the guy's gf and they had to go... I also found out that a friend of mine has a crush on a former crush of mine.  We had a very enjoyable convo about alota things and he went out... That was pretty much my nite...  Well Martha leaves tmr, im very sad... tho i wish her the best.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you... :D Have Fun!!!

      Yes... you are reading correctly... I did sprain my ankle again.&nbsp; Well I'll start from the beginning of the day. &nbsp; I awoke to the&nbsp;beautiful yet familiar melodies&nbsp;of "End of the Road" - B2M.&nbsp; Usually I go downstairs to check whos online, but it was Saturday, so I decided to sleep in until I had to shower for work.&nbsp; At 9:30, I finally got up and dragged myself to the shower.&nbsp; 9:55 got outta the bathroom... hmm... late again I see... o well.&nbsp; Listened to some "Twork It Out" - Usher as I dressed.&nbsp; 10:10ish... punched in.&nbsp; After I put on my clip-on-tie and apron, I got the chance to catch up wit a guy I hadn't seen in 2 weeks.&nbsp; I told him whats been going on the last little bit, he said I was "pimpin it", I laughed and sternly told him "no".&nbsp; He told me that he's got a tough decision coming.&nbsp; He has the job interview which pays VERY well... but hes unsure if he wants to do this or go to UTSC for me... he said hes gonna pray at church when we go together tmr, but ima start today :) &nbsp; O ya, we're doing this thing where we go to different churches and see the differences... I shoulda started writing notes... o well, we've only gone to 2 so far:&nbsp;Forward and his old catholic church, but I hope we visit lots more!!&nbsp; For those of who dont know... catholic churches IMHO are so boring!!&nbsp; Like no offense but it was too much.&nbsp; I stayed awake the whole time cuz it was an evening service so it was shorter and cuz it was my first time.&nbsp; They are very ritualistic there, lotsa chants and stuff they expect u to memorize.&nbsp; Also, I never noticed how enthusiastic Pastor McNeil is, but the main priest I guess is sooo boring to watch.&nbsp; I'm sure he was praying or something... but I coulda sworn he was sleeping for pretty much the whole thing!!&nbsp; He didn't preach but my friend tells me that they are very boring when they do, while Pastor McNeil is very emotional and talks to YOU... I love my church.&nbsp; I wish I was there more often... lol, I say this but I'm breaking some1's heart (well not really) by not going to the picnic tmr.&nbsp; Then again some1 couldnt tell me how to get there, and I did sprain my ankle so I dont feel so bad... but still... sorry :(.&nbsp; I truly will miss you, esp if I dont see u again... &nbsp; Well back to my boring work day...&nbsp;after catching up wit my friend&nbsp;while filling the bread, we all topped off the grocery order, went on break (hehehe, extra long one), and buggies.&nbsp; Then he and I got split up, he did the dairy order and I did the pop >. &nbsp; As soon as I arrived, I signed on and relieved me self of all that discomfort by visiting the bathroom... ah ya... felt so good after.&nbsp; Then I ran some sc wit my "SC GOD" of a friend, got struggled too many times (cuz of me :\), talked to Matt, relieved myself one more time and ran some ball. &nbsp; When we got there, my SC friend and I shot around, then my bro came, and 2 others came.&nbsp; We ran 3v3 wit some other guy... WOW my teammate struggles!!! No offense but it bothers me when they struggle that much... I mean, every guy he D'ed up beat him in 1 second.&nbsp; And when a teammate starts straining, the team does too.&nbsp; I had to come over and help everytime and they would somehow score from open shots or beating me cuz I would have to run out to contest the shot.&nbsp; And hes offense is just as bad!!!&nbsp; He misses open layups, throws away the ball, and has the most dash shot EVER!!! **sigh**&nbsp; I'm sorry for saying all this, but I had to get it out. Well finally he left and so did the mystery guy, so it was just me, my friend, my bro, and his friend.&nbsp; We started a boring game of american, gave up on that and ran 2v2.&nbsp; Teams: me and my bro's friend vs my bro and our friend.&nbsp; Wow... my teammate is too good!!&nbsp; He's just all day!!&nbsp; He kept on hitting pull ups over my bro... that's the kinda shot that I work towards ^.^&nbsp; Anyways, we won the first game 11-6.&nbsp; Second game:&nbsp; we started off on fire!!&nbsp; It was 7-3 when the I got injured again.&nbsp; I had been kinda struggling down low all day, but my shoot was doing good.&nbsp; Finally, I set up in the post again.&nbsp; As I backed down towards the left (if ur on offense) of the net, he pushed back.&nbsp; I did my fav drop step&nbsp;to the other side and had a nice open shot.&nbsp; Here's what ran through my mind as it happened: "drop step, ok, elevate, follow through.&nbsp; Sweet, there's another poi-" **sickening snap** **yells of excruicating pain** &nbsp; LOL, its funny now that I look back on it, but it wasnt at the time.&nbsp; My friend thought the yell was because I made a power move... I wish that was it.&nbsp; After rolling on the ground for what seemed like 5 mins... I told them "I'm finished" limped my way to&nbsp;my&nbsp;ball, and wit a few breaks outta the court.&nbsp; I climbed half way up the hill and plopped my large body on the bench.&nbsp; There I cringed in pain some more, and watched the a play from my sub.&nbsp; O ya, my sub was a lil kid that we sent away just a few mins b4.&nbsp; He acts like hes good buy... umm... no.&nbsp; I observed as my teammate drove and dished the ball to him.&nbsp; Then I watched as the ball slipped through his hands and flew to the other side of the court.&nbsp; Im not sure what happened in between, but I saw him get easily beaten by my man.&nbsp; It was gonna be a long day for my teammate... he was getting crappy partners all day.&nbsp; I was the only good one, o well... &nbsp; When I got home I got a drink, checked my comp, and hopped up the stairs.&nbsp; Then I took a painful shower and cleaned my room... I dunno why either, kinda random if ya ask me, but I did anyways.&nbsp; Then I limped to my comp and started this.&nbsp; That was almost 2 hrs ago... well it's not really my fault... I've been chatting the whole time... wit 3 ppl at one point... but I've finally finished my boring day... and my ankle isnt feeling that bad... cant run or anything like that... but its not killing be as it usual does.&nbsp; But the morning after is the WORSE!!!&nbsp; Like one time I lilterally crawled to the bathroom to shower for school.&nbsp; I dont remember if I actually did take a quality shower that day, the pain was simply unbearable... anyways I should be good for wednesday scheduled noon game ^.^ &nbsp; Well last post I recommended some good R&amp;B songs... but a lil Mrs. KnowItAll said that she alrdy heard of all of them... so here are some good BSB &amp; N*Sync songs: (**means not popular but still great) &nbsp; N*Sync: **Everything I Own I Drive Myself Crazy &nbsp; BSB: Quit Playin Games **Just to Be Close to You All I Have to Give As Long As You Love Me **Back to Your Heart &nbsp; Those are my FAVS... there are alota singles that I didnt list, and songs that I enjoy but I also didnt list as to not clog up my blog.&nbsp; I just wanted my top songs for you to love and enjoy... so enjoy ^.^ &nbsp; Hmm... on a happier note:&nbsp; I made it one week without... doing something... at work!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!! thx for the prayers. &nbsp; To every1 who wanted to see me at the picnic tmr: sorry, Im a horrible and lazy person... also standing all day wit a sprained ankle doesnt sound to appetizing.&nbsp; AND, I'd have to leave early anyways cuz I gotta hook up wit my friend and get some more vitamin G-O-D... anyways, if I dont see&nbsp;YOU&nbsp;again then I'm very sorry and I'll miss you the whole time... t.t &nbsp; Matt: town centre sounds good, but I still feel bad for making you travel soooo far.&nbsp; I feel bad for making u watch Spidey2 again too... wow... I'm a jerk.&nbsp; But since we already decided its too late ^.^ ... hahaha... im so bad... &nbsp; Anyone wanna reach pickering flea market??&nbsp; I really need clothes... I need some 4x Tees, some extra baggy jeans, some new HIGH CUT ball shoes... hmm... thats about it. &nbsp; O ya, I need y'all's (lol, thats so no a word) opinion... How would I look if I shaved my head??&nbsp; Not like skin head shave... but more of a bald fade... like alota azns have.&nbsp; I really wanna try it but im afraid to part with these long, dark locks I love... and I'm afraid that it'll look bad... and that my head will be WHITE!!! Ah who cares??!!&nbsp; Thats something for my summer list for sure! &nbsp; Anyways, See y'all later &nbsp; Warren &nbsp; [19] &nbsp;

      What a waste of a perfectly good day off... **sigh** here's what i did yesterday:  Woke up, commented a blog, sc/msn i believe, lunch, sc, shower, phone/msn, went to buy stamps and mail letter, sc w/ a friend, solo sc, sc/msn the rest of the nite.  -_- ... what kinda day off is that??!!  My first idea was MvC2 at fariview... but my friend had no $$$.  Then I wanted to run some ball... crappy weather, looked like it was gonna rain at any second.  Got back on the comp, talked to some1, we almost made plans but due to indecisiveness or busyness on their part, it fell through.  So me and my friend wit no $$ ran some sc.    *** U sc illiterate prolly dont wanna read the next few paras*** *** Those who don't care also wanna skip the next part*** I hosted a 2v2 LT, since we had diff names ppl didn't know we where friends so it was ok.   Game 1: I'm Terran (as always), friend is zerg, gainst Z&P LOL... first game, a few mins in... I had just set up my wall (terran is my fav race) when 3 zlots and 6 lings broke through.  Of course my wall had to let the zlots through :\ ... Like come on!!! IT'S A WALL!!! ... anyways i lifted my buildings and ran to my friend's base.  I had 2 rax and a cc.  So i brought the cc safely to my friend's base and used the rax for scout.  WOW!!!  If I ever met one... my friend is an sc GOD!!!  These 2 ppl who rushed me... couldnt beat him!!!  Like how??!!  He had no expos when i died... and he still won!! LOL... i need to practice.  All he did was mass hydra... but still...  Game 2: T&PvZ&P My friend goes 2 gates outside main, I wall up and go tech.  My friend sends 1 zlot, then sets of 2 after... he kills all blues probes ^.^  But somehow, I am the downfall again.  After my supposed holeless wall goes up 6 lings appear... so I'm like "ok... my wall will hold" ... Suddenly they just run around the wall along the edge of the cliff -_- ... WHAT??!! I had 2 rines at the time... they died... Luckily, the lings didnt go straight for my mins so I had time to bunker up my main... a few struggling mins later...  I survive.  My friend had 1st expo, then Z oppenent then me.  LOL... P opponent had NOTHING!!! I suddenly didn't feel so bad.  Anyways, my friend makes 20 goons, i send 3 vults and Z gives up, we kill blue and another vic!!! ^.^... at least this time I survived on my own...  Game 3: T&PvZ&T Yes... we owned.  Z went hatch then pool, but really late... my friend had 2 zlots going in before red had pool out... Z practically dies before his T ally comes to the rescue.  I was already building faster then the other T... so I dropped... 2 gols and 1 tank right on his scvs... OWNED... HEY!!! I'm getting better ^.^  Game 4: TvP This was the best game by far.  We were both terran, they were both protoss.  We both wall... lol... his wall was so simple but mine is so struggle :\ ... anyways, 3 goons almost broke through but I finally got my tank out.  Then they tried my friend... are they dumb??!!  If they cant beat my wall then they cant beat his :P Anyways, I go expo... turrets on cliff... nice...  Then we start the push.  LOL... we had like 25 tanks all over the middle of the map wit mine and turret support.  We set up outside first toss base.  He can't break through.  We send vults up... no one home.  Then we sent some more tanks up his ramp and GG.  I had comsat and scanned the other toss expo... no obs??!!  Easy vic... I dropped 1 tank, 4 gols and 4 scvs... and I immediatley started turreting the cliff.  Due to cliff advantage and no obs, he couldnt see until I had 8 turrets up and after I seiged my tank.  He tried to shuttle drop and got scared off by the turrets.  Owned ^.^  ***********************************************************************  THAT was the highlite of my day :\ ... Not that I didn't enjoy myself, it's just that I wish I coulda made better use of my day off.  I can play sc anytime (tho not always wit my friend), so I wish I went out, or ran some ball (alone or wit my Mowat friends).  **sigh**  O well... I'm back to work today... ugh... not again.

      It turns out that I was sadly mistaken... I actually did not know the answer, nor will I know for a while.  So what I thought was the end was really the middle... possibly a very long middle... but one I'm happy is there.  But before I found this out, I decided that I wasn't about to let this get me down.  If I turned around and ran everytime conflict arises, what kinda person would I be?  Luckily, I did go on msn last night, and I did sort things out.  Right when the storm was kicking up again, the person who left me in the lake came back with a life saver, almost losing us both in the struggle.  Don't get me wrong.  I still am a ghost, I still go unnoticed.  I am still that drifter who hasn't found a place in life.  But now I do have a meaning, a purpose.  I again have something truly worth fighting for.  My goal in life?  To make something of myself so that when that day comes I will be ready.  Forever... I seem to be using that word alot lately.  But now I truly mean it, not that I didn't before.  It still feels as tho forever will happen.  But now I can wait for forever happily cuz I got something to look forward to:  another's happiness.  No matter what happens, just promise me that you will be happy...  To my friends: Last post I pretty much gave y'all the cold shoulder before u even talked to me.  Im sorry.  I can't say I was lying cuz I wasn't, at that moment I wanted to be alone.  And I was alone, maybe not as long as I expected, but I was.  My trust in myself, my faith in my abilites... is slowly returning.  It was lost when I started questioning myself, but that has stopped.  Why?  I'm not sure... cuz I reached a resolution I'm happy with I guess, and that has restored my faith in myself.  But when I say that I don't wanna talk to my friends, I mean that I don't wanna talk about IT... I'm always here to talk if u want to talk about something.  To my great friend: I truly do mean it when I call u a great friend.  You where there when I needed to vent... even offered yourself as a punching bag.  Tho it may not seem that way at the time, your insignificant actions can mean the world to someone.  And your's are no exception.  I truly thank you for being there.  To the source of my anger/frustration/confusion/depression/sadness/but-most-importantly-happiness (yes... 100xhappiness :D): I was not lying when I mentioned all those emotions.  Yesterday I felt the most extreme emotions ever: from anger to regret to depression... more depression... then relief and finally happiness.  But thx to you no matter what has happened I will from now on me a stronger person.  So I dedicate this song to you:  Good Man - RL   "You could catch me in the Gentlemen’s club Substitutin’ lap dances just for love, love, love goin’ home to an empty house Thinkin’ who should I call for some fun, hey   I never knew love until you, love Never thought that I’d fall in love Till you brought out of me The man I always knew I could be, baby    I can count the lovers that I’ve had                 [Hook]  And all of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   Used to change my numbers every other week Gettin’ crazy crank calls from them freaks i'd meet  In V.I.P with a bottle of somethin’ Tryin’ hard to push on some heat  ‘Cause I-I never knew love until you, love You showed me a true love You gave me the chance Now I understand how to be a good man, oh, yes   I can count the lovers that I’ve had (I’ve had)      [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad (Relationships) I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love (The love, yes) I was just a boy and not a man (Not a man, no) Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you (You, you, you) and what you do You made me a good man    Thank you for lovin’ me  (Where is the love that you promised to love and When was the love that we share, where is your love, oh, yeah)  But if it ain't you, my love’s for nobody  (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody) (Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...)   I can count the lovers that I’ve had  (Baby, baby)   [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   It’s all because of you."

      Last nite i said, "I am now officially one step closer to happiness. Hmm... could it really come true???"  I now know that answer.  In case you cannot figure it out from the mood of this post... its... i dont even wanna say it.  I've lost the will to do what i used to.  I dont wanna write in this anymore, i dont wanna be on msn anymore, i dont even think playing ball can give me that momentary peace anymore.  I dont know whats gonna happen... to tell the truth i feel as tho it doesnt matter anymore.  I work today at 3... whats the point?  To make money... money cannot buy me happiness.  To keep busy... nothing will keep me busy enough to clear my mind.  I also dont know if ima be at the youth nite which mite not even happen.  I know i promised ppl that i would go, and i hate breaking promises.  But this may be one of those times that i do... I just... cant bear to face...  I was right.  I am a ghost.  I blend into backgrounds, going unnoticed.  I am meaningless.  I have no purpose.  I am a drifter, moving from place to place, school to school, existing solely for the purpose of being alive.  I have nothing to fight for.  Nothing to inspire me.  No goals... just going for the ride that i started.  Maybe one day i will fall out of this depression.  Maybe someone will lift me out of the lake of sorrow that i am drowning in.  But right now there is a storm overhead... and no one can lift me out.  So i will stay here... dragging myself through life only to make others who care happy.  Forever... is a very abused word.  Is anything forever?  I'm usually not one to say what i dont mean, and i've used it many times... but im doubting it myself.  Well... i was also speaking my mind.  It feels like forever is whats gonna happen.  But maybe im forcing forever.  For what?  Im not sure... to prove myself?... to avoid it happening again?  Or am i just a liar; someone who uses words when it suits them, not caring about the true meaning of what i say?  I dont know...  If you are one of the few who are still proud to call me a friend, dont try to console me now.  Usually thats what friends do, but i've done it before... and i dont want others to do it for me.  I dont wanna hear comforting words... cuz im gonna think its a lie.  As much as i trust you, i cant trust others when i cant trust myself.  And rite now i am the last person i trust.  So if ur reading this... i dont know what i expect you to do.  Nothing sounds good.  I'm not tryna say that i dont need friends.  Cuz there are many times that i have.  But right now is not one of those times.  Just leave me be... for now...

      The last few days have been a little more easy-going than the ones before.  Here's what u missed:  Sunday: I did nothing!!!  I missed church, sing&share, and 2 phone calls cuz i was on the comp playing sc or listening to music or playing xbox... could some1 plz buy me a life!!!   Well something meaningful did happen.  While i was laying in my bed, thinking about some1, that some1 called me as i was about to doze off.  I was momentarily startled when the phone rang, and i was confused when the caller display said "Caller ID Blocked".  I know of 2 ppl who when they call me it says that, and neither of them would call me at this time.  Well now i know 3!! :D  Anyways, being the worst person to talk to on the phone, after a smooth start i messed up the rest of the convo because of my introvertness.  Then i completely ruined it when i took to long to plug in my charger and let my phone die... ya im an idiot... the sad part is that i didnt get to say goodbye...  Today (Monday):  Woke up, msn, sc, lunch (leftover lasagna which was left on the counter over nite >. Well, after finally dragging myself off the comp, i had 20 mins to get to work... and i still had to shower and stuff!!  So i RAN upstairs, JUMPED in the shower, and did my thang.  ARRGHH!!! I wanted to shave too.  I swear i look like a bum if i dont shave regularily.  My facial hair doesnt come out evenly, its like random patches here and there.  I HATE IT!!!  Well when i was in the shower, i decided that i would shave anyways.  But i wanted to save time so i shaved in the shower instead of the usual in the kitchen sink.  I prefer the sink cuz i can watch myself, make sure i dont miss any spots, that my sideburns are even and then to admire myself when im done... ya, im so dreamy... :P  Well after the shower. i admired myself anyways, prettied myself up and left the bathroom. I then went to my room and checked the time: 2:58... wow, i took only 18 mins in the bathroom!!  Well i was late as usual so i started to take my time again.  As i listened to some Usher and sang along i slowly got dressed.  I realised that i really need to wash that uniform... both of them.  Finally i arrived at work When i got there... there was NOTHING to do!!! -_-  Like most of u are prolly like "so what? thats good!!" well its not cuz i have to look buzy for my bosses (well only one today, whew) ... Anyways, i filled a pop display, filled the sugar and the big bottles of water which killed an hour.  An hour??!!! that means 5 more to go??   > It WAS a long day.  Well after that hr of work... i was left to find my own work to look busy so that i will NOT get in trouble from my boss.  Finally he left, so i went upstairs to take a nice long break.  BUT I DID NOT STEAL!!! YAY!!!  thx for the prayers.  Well i came back when the grocery order came in to find a skid full of water had caved in one one corner.  Well we were gonna slowly wheel it outta the truck wit me and another guy supporting that corner... but we figured that it was gonna topple over when it hit the ramp, so we decided to try to use the "straddle stacker".  Most of u dont know what that is so i wont explain... but to use it me and another guy had to lift up that HEAVY skid so that it would be level.  But as some1 tried to get it off, the one underneath slipped.  The other guy who was helping me left laid off, and i was left to support it all on my own!!!  It was quite heavy... if it dropped it coulda seriously harmed a child... but it wasnt so bad cuz i was just holding it up.  So i stood there straining my arms asking if i should let go... a few long seconds later they told me to let it go.  CRASH!!!  The bottles at the bottom fell to the floor... but i was still holding the side... if i let that go it woulda crushed me against the wall... >. Sadly i did some serious lifting and my left forearm hurts... t.t  o well i cant think of anything else to write and da rentz are kicking me off...  [23]

      I used to be a poet back in the day... let's see if I still got it.   My Day   When I wake up in the morning, you are on my mind. When I wanna say something, the words I cannot find. What has changed? Why do I feel so strange? Why is love so unkind?  As I watch you leave, it makes my heart feel sad. But as soon as you return, once more my heart is glad. But while your gone, you're what my minds still on, So I reminisce of the times we had.  When I go to run some ball, you're still in my head. When some girl's watching me, I imagine it's you instead. So I try to score, to win your heart once more. Does more truly need to be said?  When I lay in my bed, I almost wish I never knew Of what you feel or felt, of ur feelings true. Yet I hope it doesnt die, so I close my eyes Hoping to dream of you.  [25]

      Another weekday morning, another morning for me to reflect on the nite past.&nbsp; Here's what I've been reflecting on:   Yesterday: Woke up 8ish, read an unexpected email.&nbsp; Kinda made me wish I got up when I first woke up.&nbsp; O well, that morning the thoughts of 2 nites past were still fresh so I posted.&nbsp; Then I played some WC3.&nbsp; I won twice! Woooot!!&nbsp; Afterwards I ate lunch and talked on msn I believe... I'm not sure.&nbsp; My memory of the time between lunch and work is kinda fuzzy, no offense to the ppl who filled it for me.   At 3:30ish I got in the shower to get ready for my 4-9 work shift.&nbsp; I had just listened to some of Without You - JE so I was feelin their music.&nbsp; As I showered I sang along wit someone in mind ;).&nbsp; I finally got out of the bathroom at 3:56... >.  When I arrived at work I received my new badge.&nbsp; My old was broken and I couldnt punch in or punch out so I had to sign a stupid sheet everytime.&nbsp; I think the fonts uglier on my new one but at least it works.&nbsp; No need for details here, just worked the grocery order.&nbsp; But there were some interesting points to my day.&nbsp; First of all, people were taking part in non-Christian activities.&nbsp; Usually, I would take part as well, but I've been trying to stop lately.&nbsp; After SnoCamp, I stopped, using that spiritual boost from that retreat as my inspiration.&nbsp; 3 weeks later I had started again.&nbsp; But now I've got more to help me out.&nbsp; Whenever I'm tempted I just picture the disappointed and saddened expressions of 2 ppl whom I love so much... just the thought of hurting them is enough to make me stop.&nbsp; For everyone who has prayed for my strength in these matters I thank you.   The other interesting thing at work today was the chocolate milk.&nbsp; This week we got alota things on sale for "Buy 1 Get 1 Free", including that milk.&nbsp; I've gotten&nbsp;it last three times I worked and the&nbsp;those last&nbsp;three nites have not been pleasant.&nbsp; Well, then again when I buy milk it's two 1L cartons and I drink it over like 2.5 hrs.&nbsp; Since it's so heavy I end up not eating anything.&nbsp; I have a theory of how it upsets me, but I'm not gonna get into that.&nbsp; Just remember this:   Chocolate Milk is NOT a meal replacement.    Well, after seeing a friend from school and killing the rest of my shift, it was finally time to go home.&nbsp; But just my luck, it had started to rain hard.&nbsp; Like it was, I believe, the worst rain I've ever walked through.&nbsp; As I walked through the parking lot my socks were getting wet cuz the water level was above my shoes.&nbsp; One of my coworkers offered me a ride home, but being the kinda person I am I refused.&nbsp; I hate inconveniencing&nbsp;others, but I wouldn't hesitate to help someone out if they needed it.&nbsp; I guess I'm not too humble either cuz I'm talking about Warren the Good Samaritan... but the point is I refused.&nbsp; It's literally a 3 minute walk anyways, so what's the point right?&nbsp; Then again what's the problem wit taking a ride if it's rite there, but still... no.&nbsp; Well in an attempt to keep myself as dry as possible, I used my apron as a hat.&nbsp; Needless to say it was drenched when I got home.&nbsp; Along wit my socks, pants, and both shirts I was wearing.&nbsp; YA!&nbsp; It soaked through my work shirt and soaked my undershirt, all in 3 mins of walking wit an apron over my head.&nbsp; My undershirt is just as thick as my work shirt mind you, so the rain was that bad.&nbsp; Well after hanging up my clothes to dry I hopped on the comp.   My parents were out getting groceries and then called to tell me to order some pizza.&nbsp; Mmmmm... pizza.&nbsp; After ordering I chatted wit Matt and told him of my chocolate milk adventures.&nbsp; Then my parents got home and I carried the groceries up a few flights of stairs.&nbsp; They didnt get much today, mostly cuz they are hardly ever here and we dont eat as a family over a home cooked meal as much as we used to.&nbsp; Well I've been busy too, I been either at work or out wit friends for almost every weeknite since school ended.&nbsp; Anyways, the pizza then arrived and messed up my internet connection.&nbsp; Yes, buzzing me from downstairs DCs me, so just call my cell instead :P.&nbsp; Anyways, pizza filled up the lil space I had left after that milk as I talked to Matt and Will and a lil of Koo on msn.   Matt, get some chocolate milk man!!! You love it as much as I do and today's the last day of the sale!!! If you get 28 cartons then u can drink 2L a day like me!! ^.^   Will, Will, Will... I still dunno how word bout Ada's landing got around to ya.&nbsp; Meh, it's not really important, I just needed something to start off this para.&nbsp; So, the truth is out huh?  **reads msg history**  Ya, I made that promise when I had no control over my feelings.&nbsp; But&nbsp;as I look back on it now, I still woulda done the same.&nbsp; If I hadn't done it then, then I'd still do it now.&nbsp; Looking back, I can gather the differences between mine and urs.&nbsp; But just cuz I did what I did doesn't mean that u love her less, or that I love her more.&nbsp; I'm just the kinda guy who goes all out on things.&nbsp; But being the drastic person I am doesn't make me any more qualified either...   Actually, I do not prefer Plan A over B.&nbsp; If she's happier wit B, then I'm happier too... I don't care about what happens to me.&nbsp; These 17.5 years of lonliness hasn't been so bad.&nbsp; What's another 60?    &nbsp;   "I believe there is a hero in all of us, gives us strength, makes us noble,  even though sometimes we have to give up the thing we want the most .”   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Aunt May, Spiderman 2   I always wanted to be a superhero, guess this is my chance to become one!  Besides, lonliness is not always sadness, cuz her happiness (at least in my heart)overshadows all of that.&nbsp; Don't worry, I will always have Rawlings.&nbsp; Tho I'm sure I'll replace her a few dozen times over my lifetime, shes always been there for me ^.^   Well, thats whats been on my heart lately,   See ya later  Warren   [13]&nbsp; Sorry Martha, I know that I haven't mentioned u in a while, but that doesnt meant that I havent been missing ya!!&nbsp;:P   [10]&nbsp; Yes, don't worry, I'm missing you too...

      Wow, yesterday was awesome.&nbsp; Here's what ya missed the last 2 days:   Tuesday: Work... no need for detail.   Wednesday: What a busy day!!!&nbsp; Woke up at 7:50ish, got on the comp, msn/email.&nbsp; Then after reading another heart-warming email, wc3!&nbsp; Wow, I got owned 3 games in a row... lol, in total I got 1 win and 4 losses.&nbsp; After getting fooded, I ate some leftovers and ran some ball at 11:30.&nbsp; There was supposed to be a huge game going, but it turned out to be a practice session for me.&nbsp; That's cool, I need to work my ankle back in anyways.&nbsp; Wow, it was so hot yesterday, and I was playing ball in the dead heat of the afternoon under the sweltering sun wit the smog alert in effect.&nbsp; It woulda been ok but some lil kids from some camp or something took my fountain captive!! >.  After a short convo wit a friend, I jumped in the shower.&nbsp; I had one of my old burned mixed cds playing.&nbsp; Nothing I could sing along to, but some classic jams.&nbsp; Shine - Hot Boys??!! Exactly... Anyways after shaving and stuff I got out at 2:20ish.&nbsp; Got dressed, Luckily I already decided what I was gonna wear so I was good.&nbsp; A lil last second colonge and I was good to go.&nbsp; As I left, I told my mom I was going out, and she was on the comp wit her back to me.&nbsp; She said ok and never turned around.&nbsp; Turns out she thought I was going to work... o well.   Wow, thats a long bus ride.&nbsp; It got longer at the Dragon Centre on Sheppard between from between Brimely and Midland to Birchmount.&nbsp; The bus was nice and empty till about 30 lil azn kids got on the bus.&nbsp; Some day camp I assume, they had some counsellors and stuff.&nbsp; I think one of the girls were checking me out... ò.ô.&nbsp; Those kids were everywhere!&nbsp; I was in the corner of the bus as usual, and I had put my bag on the floor to help out one more kid.&nbsp; Well the kid who was beside me kept on touching me and pointing at stuff outside the window while putting his arm across my face.&nbsp; I was quite relieved when they got off.   I arrived at Fairview at 3:55.&nbsp; As soon as I got to ground level, I pulled out the cellie to call Matt... no response.&nbsp; Ok, they're in the arcade.&nbsp; Walked across the mall to reach the arcade... no1s there.&nbsp; Ok, they're waiting for me at the theatre.&nbsp; Climb the escalator to the theatre... no1.&nbsp; I was getting really worried at this point.&nbsp; I'm sure they wouldnt have ditched me without giving me a phone call right??&nbsp; Well 3 calls later Matt FINALLY picked up his phone.&nbsp; Will went to the arcade so I went to intercept him.&nbsp; When I found him we all met at the theatre and got our tix to "I, Robot".&nbsp; Wooooo... that movie was toooo good too!!!!&nbsp; I esp enjoyed the shower scene wit Will Smith... mmmmm...&nbsp; Go and see it!! Tho prolly not at the theatre in Fairview... it was kinda ghetto.&nbsp; lol, I didnt even know the place existed till this week.&nbsp; O well, I got to sit between Ada and Will, I offered to switch spots wit Will cuz I knew he'd be happier beside Ada... but he refused.&nbsp; No matter, the movie was good so it didnt matter where u sat, unless u were at the front, but it wasnt that packed.&nbsp; Like c'mon, there are better theatres (no offense to those who love it).   After the great movie and some chuckles of me playing Will in ball, we we to the Sony Store to look for a "stylus" I think its called for Ada.&nbsp; Radio Shack? No.&nbsp; Sony Store? No, but Ada did get the guy's number ;).&nbsp; lol, hes a lil bit older but I guess thats how she likes it... haha... uh, lets get off that.&nbsp; Well after that Will went to check something out and I went to the arcade to run some MvC2 as Matt and Ada went to get some food.&nbsp; I almost wish I went wit them, cuz I got struggled!!!&nbsp; I'm talking like 6 losses in a row!&nbsp; One of them lasted like 30 secs.&nbsp; Juggernaut... the guy did that gay thing where as soon as u jump he throws out the super and u cant block!!&nbsp; Then when my 1st char died I called out my assist and somehow they both died... not that he wasnt skilled... well... nvm.&nbsp; After getting shamed I met up wit the 3 in the food court.&nbsp; They were already done and were waiting for Jaime to give Ada her letters for her missions trip.&nbsp; Ooops, sorry, I didnt write one >.  Sometimes I love to be difficult.&nbsp; Well I excercised this wit Ada as she and Matt were criticizing my shopping habits.  A- "Shopping like that is natural... for a girl"  W- "Oh... so ur calling me feminine.&nbsp; Your calling me a girl, well--"  "No! that's not what Im saying.&nbsp; I'm just saying that socially, stereotypically, it is natural for a girl to do that"  "Wow!&nbsp; So I'm not only feminine but I'm weird too huh? thx Ada..."  haha... then we started yelling (well I did) and creating a scene as she stormed off in frustration.&nbsp; She went to Coles as Matt and I reached EB.&nbsp; Nothing good.&nbsp; Then I went to the nearby Foot Locker.&nbsp; Yes... 3x black golf tees.&nbsp; But it was wrinkled, so I didnt buy it.&nbsp; Returned to Coles, Ada and Will were still going wild, so Matt and I chilled on the bench.&nbsp; They came back out and we sat around for a bit.&nbsp; Will went to check out the Bell Mobility, so we waited on the bench.&nbsp; Apparently Matt and Ada were surprised that I wasnt shopping, so I got up and started to leave them.&nbsp; Ada ran after me followed by Matt and Will who happened to have just been catching up with us.&nbsp; I joked around wit her some more as we continued walking.&nbsp; Slowly Matt and I switched spots as I got the chance to catch up wit Will a lil more.&nbsp; Ada saw an old friend, they talked as Will and&nbsp;I talked during Matt's numerous laps around the block.&nbsp; Then some mysterious things happened and Will and I were talking again.   I must say Will, I didnt know what to expect cuz it was the first time chillin wit u but ur far cooler than I gave u credit for.&nbsp; I see why Matt and Ada chose u as friends, and Im honoured that I had the chance to talk with you 2.&nbsp; So... now u heard it from my mouth... well it seems we got a problem, well I know u know it but I dont think that you know that I know it too.&nbsp; Well since I found out ur such a good guy I'd rather talk to you about it than hide from it.&nbsp; Next time we see each other wherever... we'll talk a lil more seriously.   Tensions mounted as I got a nice tour of the outside of Fairview.&nbsp; I swear I've been there like 5 times in my life >. "Warren... WARREN!!!"   Thx Will... if it wasnt for you&nbsp;I wouldnt have gotten to accomplish what I set out to do that nite... say goodbye.&nbsp; You honestly dont know how much ur efforts made my day.&nbsp; You are a true friend to every1...   Haha, I was escorted to the bus depot and didnt escort my escort back to the subway.&nbsp; And you thought I was a nice guy??!!&nbsp;  M- "Hey Warren tell me when ur bus gets here."  W- "Uh... thats it."  M- "Oh, ok"  **"gangsta" hug**  M- "See ya later man"  W- "Ya for sure!&nbsp; I'll definetly see ya soon!"  M- "Uh... Im leaving for my cottage this weekend..."  W- "Oh, guess I wont be seeing you soon then >. **exchange of "later"s**   Then a convo that seemed to fly by while I waited for the bus.&nbsp; Bus arrived... heart-warming hug that kept me on Cloud 9 the whole way back... I'll miss you more.   I got home at 10:30 and I was exhausted.&nbsp; I woulda written this last nite... but them damn rentz again!!&nbsp; O well, thank you Matt, Will and Ada for my most memorable nite this summer.  Matt enjoy urself at ur cottage!  Ada have fun in Arizona on ur trip!  Will... uh... ya... see ya later...?  lol, I'll be praying for all of you and we gotta do this again sometime (well hopefully minus the drama)   Here's the lyrics to a song that reminds me of someone.    Carl Thomas ft. LL Cool J - She Is (remix)     (V1)  Like my favorite scene in the best movie,  like the air that I breath that's what she is to me.  Like a song I just wrote or like coming home,  when I've been gone too long that's what she does&nbsp;to me.   (Oh) I&nbsp;wanna always&nbsp;to have this feeling,  (Oh) Ohhh your love is so amazing  (Oh) tell me tell me tell me baby    (tell me that you'll never go)   (Hook)  She's the light the sun would bring,  everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)  And she's so heavenly,  she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)   (V2)  Like a lover's hug when you first fall in love  Girl it means so much when your out of touch  It's like seeing you for a moment or two  Girl the thought of you is what gets me through   (Oh) I&nbsp;wanna always&nbsp;to have this feeling,    (Oh) Ohhh your love is so amazing    (Oh) tell me tell me tell me girl  (tell me that you'll never go)     &nbsp;   (Hook)    She's the light the sun would bring,    everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)    And she's so heavenly,    she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)     (Bridge)  I don't think that words can discribe exactly how you make me  feel inside,  never in my life have I been so in love   LL  Slid up in the AMG, satalite radio you next to me  legs like nestle, they constantly test me  I'm clear that the rest be tring to out finese me  our love is real, I can tell how it feel  say what you want but keep you're lips sealed  you could run your'e mouth talk extra slick and  strip in front of the plasma yes it's sick'nin  uh, belly dance for your man  make eye contact make a player react  in fact crawl on the bed while ya mans laid back  run you're pedicure across my six pack  hold my dice baby roll for ice  you free to move around I won't control your'e life  I'll just keep you heated treat you how you wanna be treated  you got an appetite for love i'll feed it   (Hook)    She's the light the sun would bring,    everything that means anything to me(that's what she is)    And she's so heavenly,    she's how the world looks to some1 whos never seen it(that's what she is)    lol, I dunno why I say "someone" insteada who it is.&nbsp; Like who am I kidding, the only ppl who read this know who it is.&nbsp; Yes, we gotta talk...   See ya later,  Warren   [14] [11]

      Today&nbsp;was awesome!!! Here's what you missed: &nbsp; I woke up at 7:40ish, sc/msn, shower at 9:40, dressed then looked for FF7 disc 3 (cant find it >. &nbsp; Following EB Matt and I went to the theatre to run some Time Crisis 3... I swear the guns musta been bust cuz Im sure I was shooting them in the head and they wouldnt die.&nbsp; When we died we got our tix and sat down to wait for Spiderman 2.&nbsp; That movie was tooooo good!!!&nbsp; If u havent seen it, then stop reading this and go out now!!!&nbsp; Unless its like midnite then I guess u can wait.&nbsp; But I definetly recommend it.&nbsp; I dunno why but I almost cried... lol... and its an action movie!!!&nbsp; Just go see it... &nbsp; After the movie Matt and I decided to get some food.&nbsp; I kept on telling him to pick a place and he kept on telling me to pick a place.&nbsp; After 25 mins of back and forth arguing we finally decided to introduce an arbitraitor... Mrs. Simpson, who was still at town centre.&nbsp; She told us to go to Taco Bell... good choice.&nbsp; When she left, we sat around and then decided to just get some McDonalds. lol, today was Big Xtra day, mmm... &nbsp; After the food, Matt got introduced to the shopaholic in me.&nbsp; I dragged him from store to store looking at everything and judging how I would look in it.&nbsp; I could see the boredom in Matt's eyes as he told me that he was fine wit it.&nbsp; I found some nice 3x golf tees... I almost bought it but stopped myself at the last second.&nbsp; I also almost bought some plain black 4x tees but stopped myself there too.&nbsp; August 20, ima have a thuggin outfit ready for some1 ;).&nbsp; Well after SportCheck, Champs,&nbsp; Foot Locker and Athletes World, we finally returned to the food court to get a fruit juice/smoothees.&nbsp; That was good too ^.^.&nbsp; After sitting down and savouring it, I decided that I wanted to see if WC3 was at EB.&nbsp; I found it, and couldnt resist temptation as I coughed up $60 for the game.&nbsp; Finally after giving him my FF7 &amp; 8 and strat guides, we parted ways at the RT station.&nbsp; I took the 129 McCowan north to McCowan and Sheppard then the 85 home as Matt went to get the RT. &nbsp; When I got home I changed and installed WC3 and the expansion.&nbsp; The graphics are CRISP!!!&nbsp; And the gameplay is tooo good.&nbsp; I dunno bout online play but the single player is nice.&nbsp; More of you should get it so we can run some intense games!!!&nbsp; I think this might replace sc :0 &nbsp; Well g2g, damn rentz &nbsp; See y'all later  Warren &nbsp; [17]

      Today was interesting... here's what ya missed:  &nbsp;  I woke up at 7:20!!!&nbsp; I'm not sure why either, I guess it's cuz I went to sleep kinda early the night before.&nbsp; Or maybe my slightly sprained ankle had something to do with it.&nbsp; Anyways, 7:30ish, I was at my comp...&nbsp; I opened an email from a special somebody but didnt reply to it yet... I wanted to save it for later when I was fully awake and was missing her even more.&nbsp; O ya... 2:30 am send time...?&nbsp; Very disappointed...jks  &nbsp;  Hmm... Matt came online and we talked about tmr... I'm really looking forward to our date!!! I mean... uh... :$... hahaha, jks.&nbsp; 11... EB... I'll be there ;) (I hope I dont forget those games!)&nbsp; Hmm... some1 else came online and we spoke for a lil bit... then they both left me alone on msn.&nbsp; That's when I replied to that email, when I missed her the most knowing that I coulda spent an afternoon wit her >. &nbsp;  This friend is my 23 yr old friend from work.&nbsp; Hes really cool, very down-to-earth and open-minded.&nbsp; He's also the one who was seeking guidance in his choice of UTSC or work.&nbsp; Well we decided to go to... arghh... forgot the name.&nbsp; But it was (something, something) of the Nazerene I think.&nbsp; Well the "Nazerene" part or some other form of that word was in it and it kinda worried me.&nbsp; I had no idea what to expect.&nbsp; My friend said that the name of the head of the church was Pastor something, so that comforted me cuz it reminded me of Forward.&nbsp; When we arrived... the church building itself was very nice.&nbsp; It has very white walls, stained glass windows on the side and a large cross on the front.&nbsp; The parking lot was VERY large and had been freshly painted.&nbsp; My fears of looking outta place were also subsided as I watched a brown family and some azns walk in.&nbsp; As we walked through the main glass doors, I noticed that the church from inside the foyer was very small... well not that small... cozy.&nbsp; As we walked into the auditorium (I guess its called) I noticed that the layout was similar to ours.&nbsp; They had a very large projector screen on the back, a drum set, an organ or piano, a podium, and some mics and music stands for the singers.&nbsp; As I sat down I noticed that they had nice cloth seats.&nbsp; Sorry to say but they are alot more comfortable than the wooden ones at FBC.&nbsp; When the service started, there were only about 3o ppl there.&nbsp; It was very empty but at the same time it gave me the feeling that I was part of a close family rather than a congregation.&nbsp; The pastor there was very upbeat, he always had a smile on his face which.&nbsp; My friend described it like he looked like he won the lottery the whole time.&nbsp; Well God's glory, salvation, grace, etc. is worth SOO much more than that so I'm sure thats the high he was on.&nbsp; The pastor also had soothing voice... like something u'd hear on the radio or one of those relaxation tapes that you listen to while u sleep.&nbsp; He also had a very full, booming singing voice to go with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately this voice started to annoy pretty soon, at the end of the song he would repeat the last verse or the chorus EXTRA slow... like he wanted to show off or something (not that that was what he was doing... he wanted us to "reflect" on the song and what we're singing)... and I always felt like he was screaming into the mic.  &nbsp;  LOL... funny thing... after a few hymns and a prayer... a lady went up to the front and asked for all visitor to stand up and introduce themselves.&nbsp; So one lady who was already a member introduced a family whose father was a pastor from Guyana... and he told everyone that when all else fails to put all ur faith in God.&nbsp; Then some1 else introduced their nephew and some1 else who&nbsp;I believe was going to church for the first time.&nbsp; I was hesitant to stand up before but how could I follow those 2??&nbsp; Well they asked one more time for visitors before finally saying, "Well for all those SHY people **stares at my friend and I** welcome to (name of church) and I hope (something, something)" hahaha, like she literally stared RIGHT AT US!! Well more at my friend but we're a group so its still us.&nbsp; Anyways, after that some1 preached a message about parents leading your children to Christ.&nbsp; Even tho it wasnt meant directly towards me, I still got some encouragement.&nbsp; But it was the fact of being in God's house which get my feelings up.&nbsp; Not that I was feeling particularily depressed, just that God brightens my day like nothing else!!!  &nbsp;  At the end of the service... I witnessed as a few ppl accepted Jesus for the first time.&nbsp; That makes me feel so warm inside, that some1 else&nbsp;has just received&nbsp;the same hopes and joy as I do.&nbsp; Then we sang another hymn and the Pastor invited all the visitors to proceed to the back after the service and get our pics taken.&nbsp; Well most of u know how much I hate pics of myself, and I had no idea why they wanted one.&nbsp; My friend wanted to go but after he spoke to the guest family from Guyana, in particular the Pastor/father.&nbsp; He asked him the differences between catholicism, baptism, and "Nazerenism" (haha, prolly not real word).&nbsp; He didnt really gimme a satisfactory answer, he said that his faith his a "holiness" faith and is based very much on confessions and something like that.&nbsp; I already can see the dif b/w catholics and baptists/Nazerenes but I couldnt decipher the difference between them and us.&nbsp; O well, Christianity is all the same ^.^  &nbsp;  Today was a very good day...  &nbsp;  Tmr is gonna be great too... ya Matt!!!&nbsp; &nbsp; See ya later  Missin ya alrdy   Warren  &nbsp;  [18]

      It's looking kinda gloomy outside and I got 3 hrs to kill before I go to work... ugh... work... here's the update:  Monday: I worked from 12:30 to 9...&nbsp; ô.ô ... Ya, so it's just an 8.5 hr shift but still, I'm not used to doing this kinda work.&nbsp; And it was on a monday, so we just got the grocery order in.&nbsp; There were 3 of us men and 1 girl doing the load.&nbsp; I separate the girl cuz she works on cash but got grocery hrs cuz 3 ppl went on vacation, shes not as fast as us tho, not cuz shes a girl, but cuz shes not used to the work we do... and cuz shes a girl :P.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyways, in total we musta gotten 6-7 skids... wooo... by the end of the nite they were all gone!!&nbsp; I worked my @$$ off... whenever I'm working and a manager is in I just can't help but work extra hard.&nbsp; I also cut my finger on a box... yes u heard me, a box.&nbsp; That box was deadly!&nbsp; It was a lil more rigid than most, and as I bent down to put it on the ground, I let it slip down my hands.&nbsp; As it went down, the corner sliced open my right index finger.&nbsp; It was a pretty big cut.&nbsp; 2 days later and it still hasn't healed yet.&nbsp; Last nite I was still able to open it and see the red of my flesh, but now its sealed itself quite nicely.&nbsp; Anyways, work was boring...  When I got home I went on msn where I learned alot more about myself.&nbsp; It's true, when I think or do things I tend to exaggerate the effects or seriousness of it.&nbsp; But I still see this as a long term decision.&nbsp; And I'm still sure that if she was wit u then u wouldn't ever hurt her enough to chase her away.&nbsp; You don't seem to understand, that if Plan B happens them Ima be happy, as in "I wont try to steal her away" happy... as long as u do as u promised.  Well... I'm 17... possibly not even finished 25% of my life.&nbsp; Sometimes I wonder, am I growing up too fast?&nbsp; Should I have done what I did?&nbsp; If I go to Plan B... well I truly be able to go through with it the rest of my life? ... I'm sure that if I was to do B then she'd want me to break that promise... but still, that'll just show more of my fickleness and tell her that she can't trust anything that I said before or anything that I will say in the future.&nbsp; And what would people who I meet in the future think when I tell them that the I broke my promise to that last person I cared for? ... But no, I still have no regrets...  Tuesday: My only day off this week ^.^ ... and it rained... hahaha, just my luck eh?&nbsp; Well I ran some SC and WC3 before I finally left to get my haircut.&nbsp; It feels so nice to lose all that extra hair and&nbsp;it's so much easier to keep in check now.&nbsp; I was considering doing the bald fade but heeded my mom's warning and decided not to.&nbsp; But honestly... is my head really too small for my body??  After the haircut we went to my Grandma's where my rentz are tiling part of their basement.&nbsp; It's look pretty good... then me, my mom, and her mom went to this cheap chinese buffet right at the corner of Brimely and Eglington called China Buffet... original huh?&nbsp; The food was good in comparison to the price, and after dinner we returned wit food for the ppl who got left behind.&nbsp; There my uncle and I ran some dreamcast.&nbsp; LOL, he beat me twice in MvC2!!!&nbsp; Not that there's any excuse, but I felt bad for running the expert tactics so I kinda took it easy on him, but he deserved those vics anyways.&nbsp; Afterwards we ran soccer, he won, then NBA 2K2.&nbsp; He won the first game by 20+ but I got the cheapest, flukest win ever the 2nd.&nbsp; It was the final minute and I was down about 8.&nbsp; Like in the NBA, my team started to intentionally foul.&nbsp; But my uncle put it on arcade mode so there were no calls.&nbsp; I took the cheap baskets and brought it within 2.&nbsp; Wit about 10secs left he inbounded and I felt bad for the fouling so I started pulling my men away from the ball handler.&nbsp; Wit like 3 secs I left I went for it to make it look close, they fouled I got the loose ball and I jacked up the 3... it rimmed around for a sec and fell in at the buzzer.&nbsp; We laughed hysterically and gave each other daps.&nbsp; But I'm sure he knew as well as I did that it was the cheapest win ever.&nbsp; I didn't say anything but still... cheap.&nbsp; Finally we went home and after a shower I feel asleep rite away.  Weirdest thing happened tho.&nbsp; I almost never remember anything I dream about.&nbsp; But today I can remember exactly what happened.&nbsp; I was here at home, I think on front of my comp.&nbsp; For some reason&nbsp;I did something to tell people that if they loved me they should come to my door.&nbsp; Someone came (don't worry not HER) and we looked at each other passionately in the eyes.&nbsp; Then I leaned forward and kissed her as I slowly&nbsp;we slowly&nbsp;moved&nbsp;till her back was against the wall.&nbsp; We stood there kissing for a while before I finally led her outside my hall and we sat down on the flat part of the stairwell.&nbsp; I sat against the wall while she sat on right on front of me so that I could wrap my arms around her.&nbsp; I'm not sure how it came about, but eventually I told her something and that I had already promised my heart to someone else... just then I woke up.&nbsp; The odd thing is, I don't remember who the girl is.&nbsp; I know she's shorter than me&nbsp;cuz I recall leaning forward and down to kiss her... but I still dunno.&nbsp; Something tells me that she's from Mowat too... hmm... any dream interpreters out there?  On the bright side it's good to know that in my dreams I can still uphold my morals and values. ^.^  Thx for reading, Warren  [8/5/9] (these #s don't express how much I miss you all)

      Today was ok, but since this is only based on one day theres not much content here. :(&nbsp; Wait... maybe thats good for those of you who read this but regret it half way through the long posts...   I woke up at 6.&nbsp; Yes!!! 6!!!&nbsp; I got up at 5:45ish to get a drink and couldnt sleep after that.&nbsp; I then proceeded downstairs and did my usual morning thing.&nbsp; I then played some more of the WC3 campaign.&nbsp; Afterwards I took a shower and got dressed to go to the pickering flea market.  The flea market was exactly how I imagined.&nbsp; A huge open place wit hundreds of lil booths.&nbsp; I hadn't gone there before so I was kinda excited.&nbsp; I had $200 in my pocket and I was ready to spend all of it!&nbsp; Well I started off the day very shy, afraid to ask any questions.&nbsp; But as I went from clothing booth to booth I got more into things.&nbsp; Asking the price of this and what they have in that size.&nbsp; Well, to keep a long story short, I left wit a pair of lite blue jean shorts, some dark blue RocaWear jeans, and a black and white "name brand" tee.&nbsp; I use the quotations cuz they have a name on the front but expert analysists (my friends) tell me that the tees are bootleg... hahaha, o well, i got some great prices.&nbsp; Usually a nice pair of jeans are at least $80.&nbsp; I payed $60 for the jeans and a white tee.&nbsp; And the shorts look very boot, but for $25 how can u go wrong?&nbsp; I payed approx. $25 in tees, nice ones wit decent designs.&nbsp; Reg tees that size usually go for 2 for $30.&nbsp; Did I get a good deal?.... I like to think so.   Afterwards my friend came over and we ran some INTENSE MvC2.&nbsp; He usually owns me but I had the xbox advantage.&nbsp; To keep this short we played for like 4+ hrs and at the end I was prolly up 8 games or so.&nbsp; If we did this at the arcade we woulda spent at least $10 on quarters.&nbsp; He's used to the dreamcast controllers while I love the xbox.&nbsp; The only diff besides the size and shape is that xbox has 2 xtra buttons that serve as PP and KK.&nbsp; This is key for dashing in linxing out supers.&nbsp; He didnt take advatange of this and strained to get supers sometimes while I cant play w/o it and abused it to my heart's content.&nbsp; But anywhere besides xbox means me getting fooded.&nbsp; After he got strained in WC3 we finally reached the courts.   When we got there, some guys were getting ready to play hockey where the net wit the mesh is so we played on another one.&nbsp; We ran a rematch of around the world and he took 1 and I took 2.&nbsp; Then I shot around and watched another game going on as my friend talked to a girl (I'm sure) on the phone.&nbsp; After, that we ran 1v1.&nbsp; The first game was on the same net we started on.&nbsp; He won and then we moved to the mesh net.&nbsp; Then he beat me 2 more times before we called it a day.   After a short chat I took a shower and here I am... my fam ate out again w/o me and I'm hungry...  On a side note, my posts lately seem to have been bothering my only fan left, so lemme explain a few things.&nbsp; Here's the main thing:  "I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit..."  No, she didn't confess love...  "I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they  might  take it."  Might is the keyword, she seemed like she might... that means 0.01% chance... which is more than I ever had.  Anyways, see ya later... all 1 of you who MIGHT read this...  Warren   [10/7/11]

      Here's what ya missed the last 2 days:   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Friday:  Hmm... did the usual morning thing on the comp.&nbsp; At about 3:30ish I went upstairs to take a nap before work.&nbsp; I took a shower at 4:30.&nbsp; Got to work at 5:02.  Work was so boring!&nbsp; Worked the grocery order from 5-7:30.&nbsp; I then took an extended break till just before 8 and faced the store.  It was the after-work stuff I remember.&nbsp; As soon as I arrived I checked my blog to see an interesting comment.&nbsp; At midnite that person came on and we chatted.&nbsp; It seems that he believes that what I have said is impossible.&nbsp; Well I hope to be the first to prove him wrong!!!&nbsp; Wait... well I don't really want that to happen unless... well nvm.&nbsp; Her happiness is the KEY.&nbsp; My purpose is merely to see it happen.&nbsp; A or B... it's all good.&nbsp; But even if A was to happen, thats not 100% happiness either cuz I know that some1 else out there isn't 100% happy.&nbsp; Nothing = 100% happiness.&nbsp; It's just a question of how close u can get.&nbsp; And the closest I will ever get is knowing that she's at the closest she will ever get.  100%... No,&nbsp; but I will be 99.9% from A or B...  And keep striving for your dreams.&nbsp; They're urs if u want it...   Someone else on msn made me realise me fickleness.&nbsp; I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they might take it.&nbsp; Then again, I always knew that I would do that.&nbsp; I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit... Ya, the single life is not for me.&nbsp; Then again, it's all I've ever had, so I dunno any better.  What? Wondering what's wit the "love"?&nbsp; Cuz it's such an abused word, everyone uses it when they dont mean it.&nbsp; That's why I hesitated to use it but did for lack of a better one.&nbsp; Have I ever known love?&nbsp; I dunno... but if this isn't it then I never have... and it seems like I've made it so that after this I never will.   Today (Saturday)  I was SUPPOSED to be at work at 9.&nbsp; Well I woke up at 8:20   Yo, I got time....   **Returns to sleep**   Ah ya... nothing like that extra 5 mins sleep... What time is it?...   **Checks time**   8:50!!!! Head buss....   (Excuse the slang)  Well, I jumped outta bed and took a shower.&nbsp; I was out at 9:10   Meh, I'm late so I might as well take my time   **starts Usher - Confessions**   Woooo.... Usher's too good!   **sings along**   I got to work at 9:22... I said sorry to my manager and he said it was alrite.&nbsp; Then I took out some bread and dropped the top "shell" right on front of him&nbsp; What a way to get more hours huh??&nbsp; Anyways, after bread, ice, and the sugar my friend came in...  I JUST realised that I forgot to fill the water.&nbsp; My manager is in tmr morning and will notice that too.&nbsp; Wow I struggle...  Well my friend who I go "church hopping" (lol that sounds so nerdy) wit came in as usual.&nbsp; We talked some more and he told me he got the job!!!! YAY!!!&nbsp; But I wont see him at UTSC next year... O well, can't have everything.&nbsp; But I am happy for him!!&nbsp; He told me that he set the bar for his pay so high that he thought it guaranteed that he wouldnt take it.&nbsp; Guess he didn't set it high enough...  There are some decent sales at Dominion this week:  Beatrice OJ - $0.99 - down from $2.19 I think...  McCain Pies - $0.99 - dunno whats the reg price...  NO!!!&nbsp; They are not paying me to say this!! ò.ô.... jks  These are the sales I took advantage of today.&nbsp; I also got hooked up from my bro's friend at McDs... sweet.&nbsp; I spent less than $5 today and got soooo full.&nbsp; As usual I told him what I've been up to lately.&nbsp; He said I was "pimpin it" again and I said "hahaha... no".&nbsp; We're reaching another church tmr.&nbsp; A mainly black dominated "revival" church.&nbsp; (No offense to u black or revivalist or read this... aprrox none)   After falling asleep on my bed I went to run some ball.&nbsp; As soon as I got there some strugglers asked me to play.&nbsp; Wow I was straining, missing open jumpers and such.&nbsp; Then one of urs rolled his ankle (I know how that goes) and some lil kid subbed in.&nbsp; My immediate thoughts was "wow well we lost", but this kid was decent.&nbsp; He even popped a few nice shots.&nbsp; He doubled dribbled and travelled alot but he was still decent for a lil kid.&nbsp; Well finally I popped 2 clutch pull-ups in my man's eye to seal the game.  Then my friend came and the strugglers got scared off.&nbsp; Well not really but they did leave.&nbsp; For a while my friend and I shot around.&nbsp; He told me how I sucked at sc and what i gotta do to get better:  Dl 10 reps of each matchup (3 in total) and study and learn em all, then train for a solid month and u'll be good.  My reaction -----> ô.ô (surprised yet intrigued)  When the court was completely empty my friend knocked over a garbage can and stood on it to fix the mesh the somehow was installed on a rim.&nbsp; He felt bad afterwards for the garbage so he put some of it back.  Hmm... then some1 came by and I fooded em both twice in "Around the World" 3pt style.&nbsp; Some weed smokers / drinkers came by and one of em came on my team to run 2v2.&nbsp; SOMEHOW... we won... but it took some clutch plays on both of our parts, tho I did get shook hard and jayed on...  My friend who was still mad that I won in a shooting game challenged me to Horse.&nbsp; I won there too.&nbsp; Then I lost 2 games of 21 cuz it got dark and my vision just died.&nbsp; I mean the rim turned into a thin black circle against the whiteness of the backboard and the lights.&nbsp; Yes... I am blind.   After ball I got home msned for a bit and took a shower.&nbsp; The rest of the fam got home and ate some good food leaving me to fend for myself.&nbsp; Luckily I got something going in the oven rite now ^.^&nbsp; Hmm... besides the msn rite now that was my day.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   What?? Oh the title.&nbsp; Well after some serious thinking I realised that this is the promise to end all promises.&nbsp; How?... dont worry.... :P... well cuz Matt, Ada and Martha are gone... that only leaves Will to read this... and I'm sure you know how that makes sense so there's no need to explain.  .................  Ok, well here it is anyways.  My promise from a msn convo:   ... i told her that if it wasnt her then it wouldnt be anybody...    Well there are 2 scenarios:  1.&nbsp; It is her and there is no need to make any promises to anyone else!! ^.^  2. It's not her and a God sent woman&nbsp;comes along.&nbsp; What do I do?   I would keep the promise, as much as I hate to defy God I will not abandon the promise, tho I made it while my emotions were wild and tho she may (what am i saying, of course she will) want me to move on, i cant, cuz a wedding vow is a promise too, no use in breaking a promise to make another rite?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (me from another msn convo)   Yes... no more promises to make for Warren ^.^&nbsp; What an easy life I've made for myself rite??   Well, Matt's leaving too now, guess it's just me and Will... :(  (no offense Will :P)   So ima miss u 2 Matt.&nbsp; Take care and Have Fun!!!

Here's what I did the last 2 days:  Wednesday: Work from 12:00-9:00  Thursday: Work from 3:00-9:00  haha... my life is soooo exciting huh?........... I am slowly going crazy from all this work.  It's funny cuz I asked for more hours and now that I have em I'm complaining.  On top of that my back is sore, I haven't had as much time as usual for sc and now I have nothing interesting to write about im my blog.  Well... maybe not everything has changed >.  Hmm, I haven't played ball in almost a week.  I think I'll go before work at 4:oo today.  I wanted to go yesterday but I feel asleep on my bed after I decided to lay there for a sec.  LOL, I was awoken by my pool of drool.  Here's my song recommendation for the day:  Carl Thomas - My First Love   verse 1   Back in highschool,   I knew a girl like you,   She was heaven sent,   All the time we spend,   You kinda look like her,    I remember the way we were   Cause we were all in love,    I'm feeling you because...      chorus   You're 5.2, Brown eyes,   I don't know what to say,    You make me feel that way,   It seems like I'm dreaming,    I can't believe myself,   I found somebody else   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go   You're so sure like my first love      verse 2   Now I'm not letting go,   I think you need to know,   I'm not mad at you,    I've been through this before,   She got away somehow,    But that won't happen now,   No never again,   I finally found a friend...      chorus You're 5.2, Brown eyes, I don't know what to say, You make me feel that way, It seems like I'm dreaming, I can't believe myself, I found somebody else You remind me of a girl that was my first love I can't let you go You're so sure like my first love      bridge    I've been dreaming   Of someone like you   I had to pinch myself    Just to see if it's true   This is crazy   Just like deja-vu   I feel like I know you   This dream is so beautiful      chorus   You remind me of a girl that was my first love   I can't let you go    You're so sure like my first love (repeat 4x)     hehe... 5'2" brown eyes...

      I haven't blogged in awhile... so here's some of what I did:  Weds: Work, got home, learned of truth from Will, went to sleep hurt and teary-eyed.  Thurs: Work...  Fri: Work  Sat: Work, ball, talked to Will some more  Sunday: Work then church wit a friend.  We visited the Ebenezer Revival Church which is mainly dominated by African-Canadians.  We both hoped that there would be ppl dancing in the aisles and an extra-enthusiastic speaker... they went 2 for 2.  It was crazy!!  Very much like the movies...  Monday: My only day off till at least next Sunday >. After that we went to Boston Pizza.  My friends were short on cash so I covered most of the bill... I'm not gonna say how much, just that I spent ALOT more than I expected that nite, the food was good tho ^_^  When I got home that nite I finally got to hear IT from the person I wanted to hear it from the most.  At first she played as tho she didn't know what I was talking bout, tho I'm sure that was a buncha BS...  well she said what I expected her to say, and somethings I didn't... emotional convo then she disappeared...  Today: Woke up, msn (was the sole reason some1 was late for work) then some sc.  I am a 2v2LT pro... well not really, but I'm alot better now.  Lunch then work.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That's enough of the update...  Well, what do you think?  I loved a girl... she wouldn't tell me the truth.  She told me a half-truth which I accepted for the full truth at the time and was happy again.  She then left for a while and her bf told me that she had been leading me on the whole time...  Incredibly... I still can't abandon my feelings for her...  My verdict was:  LOSER  She didn't have the decency to tell me the truth and I still can't leave.  Am I a loser?  Like... what's wrong wit me?  Why can't I just leave those feelings behind?? **sigh** I will ALWAYS love you...  Lately I've been loving this song:  All4One - I Can Love You Like That   they read you cinderella   you hoped it would come true   that one day your prince charming would come rescue you   you like romantic movies   and you never will forget   the way it felt when romeo kissed juliet   and all this time that you've been waiting   you don't have to wait no more      i can love you like that   i would make you my world   move heaven and earth if you were my girl   i would give you my heart   be all that you need   show you you're everything that's precious to me   if you give me a chance, i can love you like that      i never make a promisei don't intend to keep   so when i say forever, forever's what i mean   i'm no casanova, but i swear this much is true,   i'll be holding nothing back when it comes to you   you dream of love that's everlasting, well baby open up your eyes      i can love you like that i would make you my world move heaven and earth if you were my girl i would give you my heart be all that you need show you you're everything that's precious to me if you give me a chance, i can love you like that      if you want tenderness, i've got tenderness   and i see through to the heart of you   if you want a man who will understand you don't have to look very far      i can love you like that i would make you my world move heaven and earth if you were my girl i would give you my heart be all that you need show you you're everything that's precious to me if you give me a chance, i can love you like that   It's true, I never make a promise I don't intend to keep... even tho I said that I wouldn't, I will...

      The past month, this is the song I've been listenin to the most.  Everytime I hear it I wonder why I can't do what the lyrics tell me to do... Don't worry, eventually... I will finally "Let it burn"  Burn - Usher   [Intro]   I don't understand why    See it's burning me to hold onto this    I know this is something I gotta do    But that don't mean I want to    What I'm trying to say is that... I love you    I just I feel like this is coming to an end    And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you    I gotta let it burn       [Verse 1]    It's gonna burn for me to say this    But it's comin from my heart    It's been a long time coming    But we done been fell apart    Really wanna work this out    But I don't think you're gonna change    I do but you don't    Think it's best we go our separate ways    Tell me why I should stay in this relationship    When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby    Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with    I think that you should let it burn       [Chorus]    When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to    But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to    Even though this might bruise you    Let it burn    Let it burn    Gotta let it burn    Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you    Hate the thought of her being with someone else    But you know that it's over    We know that it's through    Let it burn    Let it burn    Gotta let it burn       [Verse 2]    Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to    Got somebody here but I want you    Cause the feelin ain't the same    Find myself callin' her your name    Ladies tell me do you understand?    Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?    It's the way I feel I know    I made a mistake    Now it's too late    I know she ain't comin back    What I gotta do now    To get my shorty back    Ooo ooo ooo ooooh    Man I don't know what I'm gonna do    Without my booo    You've been gone for too long    It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours    Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)       [Chorus] When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over We know that it's through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn       [Bridge]    I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on    On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)    I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on    On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)    Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh    Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)    Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh    So many days, so many hours    I'm still burnin' till you return       [Chorus]    When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to    But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to    Even though this might bruise you    Let it burn    Let it burn    Gotta let it burn    Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you    Hate the thought of her being with someone else    But you know that it's over    We know that it's through    Let it burn    Let it burn    Gotta let it burn

      Life's been quite mediocre lately... and I'm feeling extra lazy. So I'll just quickly skim through things.  I been working as usual. I think I hate my job now. Then again I got paid yesterday. I finally broke the $300 mark!! ^_^ hehe... now I gotta give $250 to my parents...  I went to TD instead youth wednesday to get my student line of credit. Got approved. Now I just gotta go and sign it and get em to pay my tuition and I'm good for the year. Hopefully my work doesn't close down cuz I need to still pay for monthly interest.  I also have a big mouth...  My dilemna: should I play SC or Star Wars: KOTOR?  That's about all my life has to offer, here's a song that has ALOT of meaning :P  Jesus Walks (remix) - Kanye West and Mase   (Verse One - Kanye West)   Between the girls in the jury   The devil tryin’ lure me, fury me   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me   My Pastors shakin’ his head, He ain’t sure of me, but surely   (Mase) Jesus walks wit me,   They asked, do you say your prayersAt least two a week?   I ain’t talking to god,I know what I’ve been doin’ G   Do you know how I be embarrassed?   My prayers sound like Ben Stiller’s on Meet the Parents    And I ain’t good, at that "give us this day"   The slaves is trying to give us this free,   I’m trying to give us this pay   Man, you know how ‘dem strippers was   We was all ‘ghetto fabulous’ All at the rooms in the Cyberus   From this Jacuzzi water, Can you cleanse us?   Can you please unfold my Cardiare Lenses?    God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses   For me I almost died, Falling asleep in the Benz   It’s something about this beat that get me tranquilized   And when I play it at my show I feel sanctified    And he gives me direction when I can’t decide   He is alive   How can you tell me that he ain’t, When I said,       -Jesus Walks-(Kanye) God show me the way, now the devil can’t break me down   -Jesus walks with me- (Kanye) The only thing that I pray is that my feet don’t fail me now   -I want Jesus-(Kanye) And now I think there is something that I can say now that’ll right my wrongs   -Jesus walks with me-(Kanye) I finally talked to God, I ain’t afraid ‘cuz his love is so strong      (Verse 2 - Mase)   Come on, Come on, Before you take my name   Take my fame   Why you had to take my shame?

       [11:36:05 AM] Matt (8) My : warren   [11:36:56 AM] Matt (8) My : ada asked me to go to see i robot cuz she wanted to spend more time with me b4 she left, then i asked will, dont get the wrong idea   [11:38:14 AM] Matt (8) My : and i wasnt puttin on no play...i jus didnt tell u cuz its not my thing to tell...if u wanna hate me then go ahead...i deserve it   [11:39:23 AM] Matt (8) My : and i've barely talked to will or ada since i got bak   [11:42:18 AM] Matt (8) My : fine...if u wanna give me the worse of it for something i wasn't really involved in and i didn't know until after u started tellin me stuff....dont think i knew about everything the whole time....i found out like half way through...and when i found out i tried to stop talking about it....cuz really it wasnt my thing to tell....but go ahead, hate me   [11:51:10 AM] Matt (8) My : i know i was a jerk for not tellin u....but look at the big pic...whos more of a jerk, me for not tellin u, or u for doing this    [12:13:38 PM] Mangy: haha... so im a jerk for doing this huh...    [12:14:07 PM] Matt (8) My : i dont care anymore, b mad at me    [12:14:12 PM] Mangy: fine     [12:14:28 PM] Mangy: listen... u can have ada too... im finished    OK, I wasn't gonna stay mad forever. Eventually I woulda given up this "grudge" and tried to get it how it was before. I said you had the worst of it rite now, Matt, cuz I hadn't heard the apology yet and I was still mad. I was eventually gonna say it was ok, and that I understood ur situation.  But u called me a jerk...  So who wants to be friends wit a jerk? I'm not sure if I would want to. I didn't think any of u were jerks for doing what u did cuz I assumed it was cuz you didn't wanna hurt me. But apparently I'm a jerk. Fine... so be it. Matt, I'm a jerk for being upset that someone I trusted didn't tell me what was going on. I'm a jerk cuz I didn't talk to you for a few days. I'm a jerk cuz u msged me on msn and I didn't respond cuz I was on sc (notice the status). I didn't wanna end these friendships, but if I'm the jerk... then you won't have to speak to jerks anymore.  I'm not into getting in between friends either. So Will, Ada, you don't have to choose between friends, I'll decide for you. Will, I will miss you when you go to school in September. Ada, I will always love you.  There, now it's over...

      Wow, it's cold in here. And I gotta do some laundry... but first ima procrascinate by doing this post.  Saturday: I was scheduled for 9-4:30, I woke up at 8:55 so I was late as usual. Got to work and did some work... our manager is gone for vacation so we got some lady as a sub... iunno, I just don't like her too much. Thankfully work went by pretty fast that day. Afterwards, even tho I was tired from all the work I've been doing lately, I went outside to run some ball. Wooo.... my shot is WET. Like honestly... I've never been so confident in my shot in my life. I played my friend 1on1, and the whole time he just didn't understand. Well, I'm a big guy so I'm known mostly for my post play, so when I was draining my shots he couldn't figure it out. There were 4 of us there so we ran some 2on2 after. They were pretty fair teams, tho my teammate had a very hard time stopping his man. My shot continued then too. We won the first game and lost the next like 3. But the real fun part was standing in the fountain... hehe... good times.  Sunday: Ran some sc in the morn then took my shower and went out wit the family. We dropped off some movie at Blockbuster then we went to the National Sports across the street from there in Pickering at my request. When I told them I wanted to go I thought they still had mad shoes like before... now all they got is some bootleg "SLAM" basketball shoe. I did find a good deal on some Nike hoodies... $29.99. Not bad considering in the winter they go for about $80. I also bought a ball shirt. It's made out of that shiny material that causes liquids to like slide off, Durasheen or something. That was also on sale for $19.99. So I did the math and calculated $57.49 after taxes so I bust out $60 in my hand while the cashier was ringing it through. Then she asked for $46... and was like "huh?", don't worry, I wasn't complaining. I also noticed she had a PUSH braclet on her left wrist... did she hook me up cuz of that?? ... hahaha... prolly just an honest mistake that I took advantage of. Afterwards it was time for some DQ. Mmmmm... I got the large brownie batter blizzard. It was so chocolatey, like I'm sure they just took some vanilla ice cream and added alota brownie batter in it and mixed it up. Then again that's what their ad said... When we left my parents decided to take us to a movie ^_^. It was kinda a struggle when we were brainstorming movies to see on the way cuz b/w me and my bro we had seen 4 relatively new releases, but when we checked the movie listings at Morningside we decided to see the Bourne Supremacy. We were 2 hrs early so my parents and little bro went to the nearby Wal-Mart while my older bro and I stayed in the arcade. At first we ran some Time Crisis 2 (ya the old one t.t) but it was pretty good. Then we started taking turns playing this basketball shooting thing. Argh!! It got me so mad cuz the ceiling is so low. Like I'm kinda tall and when I shoot I put alota arc in my shot, so alota the time when I shot it hit the ceiling. I had the record first wit 23 then 29. But my bro broke it wit 33. You get bonus time after u hit 30 so the key was getting there first. He ran outta money but I kept on going to beat him. But I swear that game cheats... like I even pointed out to my bro when it wouldn't count my baskets. Eventually I crushed his rec wit a 38 and retired as champ... that was after $20 in tokens... LOL! Finally we went to wait outside the theatre. There was a movie still playing there, something about "Thunderbirds", so we waited outside. As people started waiting with us, one of the Deli ppl from my store arrived and said hi, then a few mins later a guy I know from grocery came by for the same movie too. The movie was pretty good - 3.5/5. Alota killing and intense chases... always good. Iunno, I think I kinda expected a little more... Well after that we went to the Swiss Chalet across the street. It was so empty inside I thought they were closed! When we finally got served I figured why cuz the service sucked. It was a decent meal and I paid for most of it. But we're not going back there again.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well know I guess I gotta address certain ppl...  Will, I commented ur blog so check that. We still are friends...  Matt, I do care that your back, despite still not saying anything to you. I'm sure that Will or Ada filled you in why not. You and Ada both had a countdown here (check earlier posts) but I ended both of them when I found out. You were the one who I felt I could talk to the easiest about what was happening, but you didn't tell me either... I guess at Ada's request. Even tho she is ur best friend, I still don't hold you any less accountable than the other two. I may not be your best friend, but if you were willing to call me a friend at all then I believe that I deserved to know. Don't worry, I'm not gonna be a jerk and start telling ppl the things you've told me, tho the thought has crossed my mind a few times. But as far as I'm concerned, everything that happened since I told Ada how I felt to now was all an act you put on... Trust is a dangerous thing.  But you still have the title of "friend" in my books if that's what ur wondering.  Yet it seems you got the worse of it.  I forgave Ada alot easier than I thought I would (stupid weak heart) and Will and I spoke once in person before he told me and that was when we say I, Robot.  But you I trusted the most...  Now I wonder, did Ada ask you guys to come cuz she was afraid I was gonna pull something?  At first I thought it was just cuz u both wanted to see her that last nite before she left, but now I think there were other reasons too... I ask this her rather than in private because I'm sure I woulda eventually asked all 3 of you, so I guess u guys can collaborate this one too now...  Hmm... now I'm thinking about alota things.  This post was supposed to end after my address to Matt but here I am still...  Ada... I still think about you every spare moment I have, but now its different things.  I have no idea what's going on between u and Will lately, and I can't even imagine what's been troubling you lately.  Alota the time I keep things inside cuz I don't wanna put any extra pressure on you... tho I guess from me posting here I'm doing it anyways (it is MY diary after all :P).  Sometimes I wonder... why did I forgive you so easily?  Why do I still try when you already told me that you weren't going to pursue romance anymore?  What do I expect to happen in the future?  Is there REALLY any space for me in ur busy, busy life?  What can I do that Matt and Will can't?  Am I making thing worse by wedging myself into your life?  What do you really feel for me?  ...then finally... if I was given a chance wit someone else, would I move on?...  I know that you've got more important things on your mind, so don't ponder these questions... in fact, knowing that your prolly gonna read this makes me wanna delete it, but I won't... don't bother with any of this till ur life is a little more stable.  As usual... I'm willing to wait as long as you need  It's funny how starting to write can set you off on other topics...

      Nothing like a good day of ball to exhaust you and let you fully enjoy sitting on front of your comp!  My body is sore all over... I LOVE IT!!!  That feeling of, "Yes, I did something constructive with my time."  What's so constructive you ask?  Well, I got some well-needed excercise, I got to work on my game, I got to completely destroy on of my friends I rarely see, and I got to play wit my bro and share some laughs.  The last thing was key, as we hardly spend time together with him working nites and sleeping in the morning and me go to work in the afternoon.  I also got to see someone I went to elementary school wit.  He was the best ball player then, and he is still amazing.  Like I wouldn't dare to play him 1on1.  He's getting some interest from some US universities, but he's going back to high school next year to  work on his game and marks.  I'm so happy for him, he's didn't fall into the many traps that high school has to offer...  I can also say that I have finally "Let it burn", tho I still wish you the best...  Matt, you said the next move is mine, so here it is... While you were still at that camp, I already forgave you.  I know it was unfair for you to get the most of my anger, but that's just how it happened.  Though I did get to see some of your truer colours.  I don't hate you, I just don't feel that urge I had before to speak to you over msn or see you outside of church.  When I see you next, I will smile and act like everything is normal, but I'm unsure whether it will be 100% sincere.  Ultimately, it was simply outside circumstances, hot tempers, and my pride that ended it.  I still read ur blog if ur wondering, and I still care.  I still think of you as a friend, tho not as highly as I once did.  Maybe one day things can be the way they were, or maybe that day will outlive us both...  On a brighter note, I can't wait for university for many reasons.  Alota ppl I know are going there, but more importantly, alot I don't.  I just really need to get that tuition paid off...  ARGH... my back hurts... ^_^ ... haha, I'ma sleep well tonite.
