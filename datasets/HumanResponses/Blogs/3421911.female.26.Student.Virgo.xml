      my mother died seven years ago today.  she died of breast cancer.  they say these things usually skip a generation, which means i'm safe but that if had kids, they wouldn't be.  my mother was a very cheerful woman.  she had a unique laugh and her eyes would shrink whenever she was happy you couldn't see the white in her eyes anymore.  she was so easy to please.  i'd get good grades, she'd smile.  i'd get her a new blouse, she'd smile.  i'd sing her a song, she'd smile.   i wish  all  people were that easily content.  she was a very giving woman.  they were 10 children in the family, not counting her half-brothers and half-sisters.  she was the fourth child of my grandparents and she took care of each and every one of my aunts and uncles.  she'd help my aunts find work, she'd lend her brothers money and she was nice to all their kids even when they weren't exactly nice, grateful and respectful to her. she'd give them stuff even before they could ask.  she was very giving to my dad.  i don't know how i manage to put up with my dad, but she could and she did one hell of a job,too.   she was very supportive of him, even when he wasn't exactly right all the time.  she said she loved him the first time she laid eyes on him.  and love him with all her might, she did.  my mother was very strong and brave woman.  her faith in the Lord was unwavering.  you couldn't really tell she was sick until you saw her scars and she gave a big fight until her last breath. when she left, she was smiling.  i miss you, mama.  thank you for watching over me.

      i've always loved Alanis Morissette.  i love her music, i love her angst. i got all her albums and i even bought a vcd copy of Dogma because she played God there.she was the angry white female, i was the angry brown female. for some weird reason, she could put into words and music the things i couldn't whine about.  it's like Jessica Zafra, only Alanis is more musical and Jessica is limited to writing and whining.  my college classmates told me i could do a great rendition of Alanis' songs. it's how i got into a band in UE.  they said i nailed Hand In My Pocket so bad they thought they were listening to the radio. the pleasure is mine :)  when i had a haircut after the breakup, Alanis' new video for her new single Everything came out. a friend pointed out that i was trying to copy her again which is weird considering she is considerably happy in the arms of Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder, Two Guys and a Girl) while i am very much unattached.  she is unexplicably happy that she doesn't look like Dave Grohl's long lost sister anymore(rumor has it that Taylor Hawkins agreed to be  urlLink The Foo Fighters'  drummer because Dave looked so much like Alanis. Taylor used to play drums for Alanis.  hehehe).  people usually get a haircut when they're depressed,i got a haircut 'coz i was depressed.  Alanis got a haircut 'coz she's happy.  weird, huh?  but then alanis is  sui generis , she is a class of her own.     i feel good everytime i hear her new song Everything.  it makes me wish i can find my own "Ryan" to make me feel so happy i can sing, walk along the desert with a guitar in my hand,wearing my powder blue halter top, sporting my new do :)    Everything  I can be an asshole of the grandest kind  I can withhold like it’s going out of style  I can be the moodiest baby and you’ve never met anyone  who is as negative as I am sometimes  I am the wisest woman you've ever met.  I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected.  I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen  And you've never met anyone  Who's as positive as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   I blame everyone else, not my own partaking  My passive-aggressiveness can be devastating  I'm terrified and mistrusting  And you’ve never met anyone as,  As closed down as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   What I resist, persists, and speaks louder than I know  What I resist, you love, no matter how low or high I go   I'm the funniest woman you've ever known.  I am the dullest woman you've ever known.  I'm the most gorgeous woman you've ever known  And you've never met anyone as, as everything as I am sometimes.  You see everything, you see every part  You see all my light and you love my dark  You dig everything of which I'm ashamed  There's not anything to which you can’t relate  And you’re still here   And you’re still here  And you're still here...

      I love my band.  They’re like my kids, only they didn’t come out of my womb.  I was “Nanay Bels” and my girlfriend was “Tatay".  Whenever they had problems, whether it was about school, or family, or their love lives, they’d come to either one of us for advice.  This is my, I can’t remember anymore, nth family.  I had kids in UST, from the UST College Journal, the JCBA Debate Society and the JCBA Chorale; I had kids in San Beda, both from the straight and the gay communities; I have kids in UE.  I think the biggest population of people where I have “kids” can be found in UE.  Everybody calls me “mama” or “nanay” in UE, even people who are slightly older than I am.  I don’t exactly mind, except that, after the breakup, everybody was all upset.  Not that they had to take sides from either one of us, it was just different.  We were together for three years and everybody, and I mean, EVERYBODY couldn’t get used to the fact that we weren’t together anymore.  Mark, from the original batch of Lex Palooza, said we were icons.  Icons?  In Constitutional Law, we fall under the term “public figures”. Really?  Some people were genuinely upset when they found out my girlfriend and I broke up, the “kids” were very much affected.  Others were just waiting for it to happen.  You know how straight people think.  They like you individually or together but they don’t necessarily expect your relationship to last that long.  You know, so they could spit out,   “I thought so,”  I think there wasn’t any real big relationship to watch aside from ours so you could consider us as a source of entertainment in the college of law.  Nothing really big was happening if there weren’t any gigs and the students were tired of studying so they make it their business to meddle with other people’s affairs.   I’m still “mom” to some people.  Well, as far as the kids from UST and SBC are concerned, I’m still their mom. ‘Coz when I assumed mother status, I was just mom and dad could be whoever I was dating at the time so if the relationship didn’t work, they didn’t really need to adjust much.  I was like their friend who was sooo in touch with her maternal instincts.  They like it that way.  I’m big sister, mother, friend ‘coz they couldn’t exactly share everything with their real mothers.  I’d let them smoke and drink for as long as they could take care of themselves.  I just pamper them like a mother would without necessarily giving them allowance, just little things that make you more lovable as a friend but short of a mom already.  And it was sooo okay for me to date a younger guy ‘coz if it didn’t work out, I could just refer him to one of my “daughters”.  They never really mind when I give advice, whether if it’s about business or family or sex or love because they know that I know what I’m talking about.   Especially when I talk about sex.   I usually start with the phrase, “okay, take this educationally,” and a discussion about boys and girls and gays and lesbians and the birds and the bees follows.  It’s all good.  I wouldn’t really start talking if I didn’t know they were mature enough to absorb everything that I said and I censor myself.  I don’t really yak when there are people who are below the age of 18 around.  I don’t assume to be responsible although I try to be, to set a good example.  After all, I’m their “mom”.  I don’t meddle with their decisions although they give weight to my opinions, especially about their love life.  Been there, done that.  Well, almost done everything.    I’m not God. I’m not perfect. I’m just “Ate Bels” or “Nanay Bels”.  I can’t always assume that when I say something they’ll do exactly what I said or that I’m always right.  I can’t always be right.  I just let them know that when they need me, I’m there and if I can’t always help, that I’d at least listen and try to understand what they’re  going through.  Everybody needs a sounding board, a hug, a smile, a hand, anything that might give them hope.  Because I’m not God and I don’t try to be God.  But if I can tell a person that there is a God and that prayer helps when all hope is left (I’m beginning to preach and I don’t even mean to.  Religion and morality is relative.) Then my work is done.  I mean, when I’m lonely or despondent, I’d want someone to talk to me and listen to me whine and hug me and tell me everything’s gonna be okay so why can’t I do that when somebody else needs it?  I think this all started when my own mother died.  Not that I blame her for leaving but I kinda felt the need to share what I had when she was still alive to people who take their moms for granted.  Or it could be my frustration to have a kid of my own (because I always thought I’d have kids but no dad and I thought this way even before I was going out with a lesbian) that I have this insane urge to take care of everybody else.  That or the thought that if you were nice to people bad enough, they’d be nice to you too. I don’t know.  I honestly don’t know.    Right now, I just want to enjoy being “Bels”, whether it’s “ate” or “mommy”, I don’t really care.  I’m just enjoying my life.  I just keep telling everyone to get used to the idea that “nanay” and “tatay” aren’t together anymore, that we may never get back together, and if “tatay” gets a stepmom, to just be nice to stepmom.  I mean, I’m still their friend and as their friend, I’m entitled to find my happiness.  If I bring someone who could be potential stepdad or stepbutch, I’d want them to be nice to him/her too, right?  I want them to be happy and I want me to be happy too.  I’ve always been “mom” to people even before I met this girl and I’ll always be “sorta mom” to people even after she left my life.  It’s like how your friend will always be your friend before, during and after his stupid boyfriend dumps her.   so i am :) urlLink

      i had a haircut two years ago; after I got rid of the two people I cheated with while I was still with my girlfriend.  Well, actually, I didn’t get rid of them, they graduated so they were out of my hair and I started making amends with my love.  I tried to get everything back to the way they were, before I cheated.  I kept saying to myself, maybe if she wasn’t such an insensitive asshole who always ran out of money and got sick all the time, I wouldn’t have cheated on her.  If she didn’t take me for granted, the thought of kissing someone else other than her wouldn’t have crossed my mind.  We weren’t having enough sex, which is not to say that sex was the end-all and be-all of our relationship. She just wasn’t as sweet as before, like when she-snagged-me-from-someone-else before. Since I was the guilty party, I tried to forget that her insensitivity and lack of creativity led me to cheat on her.  Come on, cheating is cheating. When you hurt someone you love, you break their trust and unfortunately, trust isn’t won back that easily even if you break into Tracy Chapman’s Baby, Can I Hold You Tonight.  And even if it was the other person’s omission that led you to break that trust, the fact remains, you folded. Folded badly, I did.  That was 2002.  Things were different the year later. I tried so hard to make it up to her.  I bought her stuff, I fed her, I loaned her money, and I took care of her when she was sick.  Things were exactly the way they were before I cheated, except for the cheating part.  I was sweet and caring and everything.   Sometimes I thought, "Why the hell am I doing this? She was the one who wanted to get back together immediately after my big boo-boo, she was the one who said that things would be different, that she’ll be sweeter and more sensitive, that we’ll start from scratch, that’s everything’s forgiven and forgotten and shit like that.  She only realizes how important I am when I’m important to somebody else.  But every time I point out that she’s not doing her part or that nothing really changed, it always comes up.  It always has to come up like some big excuse she finds convenient to use when she’s an asshole.  There is a prevailing doctrine in law,  the principle of   estoppel . It goes: one should speak when he ought to speak and should be silent when he ought not to speak.   I remember it clearly, because, she is estopped from using that excuse on me.  She could’ve not taken me back. I mean, I cheated and I didn’t want to get back together right away because it was my fault. I wanted her to get mad and ignore me and treat me like shit ‘coz I deserved it.  But she didn’t, she took me back.  A year later, when I’m kicking my butt so hard just to please her and I’m just asking for a little respect or appreciation, I get this?  She met her student-dentist in 2003. We were all fourth year students at the time.  They became really close. So close, my girlfriend’s gift to this girl was the exact same gift she gave me on our month-sary (a bottle of strawberry daiquiri) except, hers was gift-wrapped and mine was in 7-11 plastic.  I had chocolates, she didn’t have any chocolates, but they spent the afternoon together.  Dental appointment :)  I come home late at night and she wouldn’t bother to ask me where I was or if I was safe but she had time to text her dentist that she was okay :(  and other shit like that.  Being the blabbermouth that I am, I kept complaining.  I’m a jealous girl. Weird huh?  I flirt with everyone but when my girlfriend does it, I get jealous of everybody.  We were arguing all the time.  She kept saying, “ You always accuse me of doing something behind your back when I’m not even doing anything.    I trusted you and you screwed up!”  It’s funny how the past has its way of getting back to the present.  When I was cheating on her, I told her I wanted to have time alone for myself when I was  actually with somebody else.  She didn’t really give me that time to think.  When I was with that other person, my mind was clear.  I had an opportunity to realize how unhappy I was with my girlfriend, even if I didn’t want to admit it because I was so in love with her to actually see it.  I was mean, I was bad, I hurt her so bad, and I know that.  But that was two fucking years ago.  When she finally broke up with me, November 10, 2003, that’s what she said.  She needed time to think for herself, that she hasn’t completely gotten over what I did and that she needed to be away for a while and I let her.  It’s actually very hard to stay away from a person with whom you share a sorority, a band and all your classes together but I shooed away from her because that‘s what she wanted.  Of course, I could’ve bugged her the same way she bugged me when I needed to be alone.  I could’ve stalked her to death the way she was at our house  everyday , I could’ve threatened to kill myself the way  she did  or tell  her folks  what their only daughter was doing with another  person’s daughter the way she did.  But I didn’t.  I backed off.  I was sooo busy blaming myself, kicking myself in the butt for something I did two years ago that it never occurred to me that  she was cheating on me . She did to me the exact same thing I did to her:  she broke up with me to be with dentist :(  Why did I not see that?   Every now and then I see them in the library, studying.  They look so cute I want to shoot them.  But I don’t.  I don’t.  They should be happy, they should be.  I mean, her breaking my heart should be worth something, right?  They should live happily ever after. Because if I’m hurting, if I’m miserable and having difficulty studying because I see the two of them together or because people won’t let go of the fact that we’re not together anymore ( our public is still experiencing withdrawal symptoms ),  they should be happy, right?  ‘Coz if I’m miserable and they’re still not fucking happy, then fuck them!  They’re asking for too much. I ain’t gonna pick her up when she falls again.  I was doing that even before we got together and all three years that we were together.  I told her the first time I cut my hair really short that I was getting rid of my demons. By demons, I meant, the two people I cheated with, I got them out of my system.  After my graduation, I cut my hair really short again. It was a sign she knew very well.  Days later, she cut her hair really, really shorter than mine :)

      i went out with my friend Beth for a drink after she gave me a copy of memory aids (aaarghh!!! i have to f***in' read all 650 pages of it!!!)which she got for me.  letting her have a drink was the least i could do.  i took her to this restaurant/bar near my dorm where this guy (haven't really thought of a name for him yet) and his friends where drinking.  jeez, all the students from ue drink there.  anyway, i had wanted to talk to "this guy" because i wanted to clear something with him.  there was this issue that i had the hots for him or that i was spreading news that he had the hots for me(made my ex think i was beginning to become a loose woman when she heard about it.  HELLO?!) so i thought i'd talk to him about it.  just to clear the air. because i don't want people saying anything about me when i come up to him, not that what people say matters, i just don't want that in my head right now.  i'm gonna take the bar, for crying out loud, i don't need shit like that.  so we talked and he explained that he wasn't the type of guy who would spread rumors about his female friends nor would he try to hit on any of them, myself included. then he left our table with the message that we'll just be civil and that nothing of the sort can ruin our budding friendship, 'coz he is nice.  and he could be pretty useful since i need people to help me out when i review for the bar.we shook hands.  we made  beso .  i was even joking for him to give me another kiss, because i am like that.  it's how i know everything's cool.  i don't really like people to put malice in what i do to them nor do i put malice in what other people say and do to me.  i can even joke about doing it in the bathroom with a guy (or girl, as the case may be) without actually really doing it.  but then, i forgot that "this guy"  has already had a couple of beers on him.  definite no-no.  i came up to him again to ask him to light my cigarette (next time, i'll remember to  ALWAYS  bring my lighter with me) when he asked me if i was going home already, where my dorm is, who were at the dorm at that particular instance and that nobody was gonna know.  KNOW WHAT?!  then i remembered, fuck, i joked about doing it! he had his arm around me and our backs were turned against his companions and he was asking me if i wanted to do it! damnit!  NO! NO! NO! come on, he's nice, he's fairly attractive and he also said some ten, twenty minutes ago that he doesn't hit on his friends!  i could almost be his sister, for Christ's sake! well, i am his sister, sorority sister. he kissed me on the neck and his arm was around me and he kept touching my butt! i told him no, even when he kept on saying that no one would find out about it and that no, he wouldn't enjoy it 'coz i would only leave him hanging, i'm known for that and no, I DON'T WANT TO.  i flirt with everybody, i can do it(have sex) just for the sake of doing it, without commitment and without regrets.  BUT HELL, I DON'T SHIT IN MY BACKYARD.  we go to the same school, we're in the same organization and we almost have the same set of drinking buddies.  i just cleared the air because i don't need trivial issues to deal with while i'm reviewing for the bar then he gives me this?  i could call it sexual harrassment because even if i was the one who provoked him by joking about it (probably made him fantasize about me all that time i was seated away from him), he was the one who kept touching my butt when i didn't want him to.  i said no.  it could well be my fault because i shouldn't be joking around men who drank too much beer.  i don't know.  i just don't need this right now.  not ever. but it's not just my fault. he should've known better.  we were both drinking, not together, but the fact remains, we weren't totally sane about the words coming out of our mouths.  he shouldn't have assumed that just because i joked about it i would actually do it.  hello?!  NEVER ASSUME OR ELSE YOU WILL FALL FLAT ON YOUR FACE. that's how this whole "clearing the air" thing started in the first place, because of false assumptions.     people assume too much.  i can't always assume to be right 'coz most of the time i could be wrong.  people shouldn't assume.  I HAVE TO STUDY.  650 pages is a long way to go for me to wrack my brain over sex.

      i am a flirtatious bitch.  i make friends with everybody.  i get all touchy and feely sometimes, especially when i'm beginning to be close to the person.  and i don't just do that with the guys, i'm sweet to everybody which sometimes give people the wrong idea about me.i don't really care about what other people say.  never have.  won't start anytime soon.  i have this ability to lead people on.  i never really thought about myself that way until a good friend pointed it out.  teaser was even the term he used. pretty far from how i perceive myself considering i spent most of my lifetime running after people who don't even know i exist.  think unrequited love.  but i am a flirt, no doubt that.  i used to think of that term so negatively that i hated being tagged as such.  then i learned that most people couldn't really do what i could do, meaning make friends with their crush or get that boy's (or girl's) number.  i had guts.  sometimes, an over-abundance of guts. Robin Williams'  carpe diem  got me pretty bad.  i like flirting with people, men and women alike, because there's something terribly exciting with playing with a person's head. i mean, mind. it makes you more creative.  but i can be very bad.  how bad?  i don't go around breaking young guys'(girls'.  jeez, straight out of Michael Jackson's billie jean.  never saw that coming) hearts.  i just get a morality attack and all of a sudden what sounded like a great  hot  idea doesn't appeal to me anymore. hence, the term EBTG or teaser.  it hurts the other person to a certain extent but i don't really seem to care. i don't know why but it sort of occurred to me that if a guy can lead you on and make you believe that you're the most beautiful person in the universe just to get you to bed and treat you like shit afterwards, why not do it to them?  give  them  hell.  for a change. somebody's got to do it.   i'm not saying i represent all the women out there who got dumped after being devirginized 'coz chances are, they wouldn't want to bond with me. i mean, i'm not exactly Mother Teresa. i flirt, remember? surely, there must be a lot of really sweet guys out there who've met people like me and who are cursing those women just the same.  i just don't want to be the victim anymore.  i don't want to get hurt anymore.  and if letting a horny guy's hard member go to waste will do the trick, i'm all for it.  damn, there's so much more to a woman than what's between her legs and if that's all a guy is interested in, then sowee :)

      i'm gonna take the bar examinations this coming september.  i'm really very nervous.  i'm finally gonna take a shot at fulfilling my dad's lifelong dream.  it hurts to disappoint.  i studied Philippine law for six years. prior to law school, i studied business. i was thinking, maybe, i'd let the corporate people enslave me for three years or so before i started my own gig BUT daddy wanted his only child to become a lawyer since he couldn't be one, not to mention there was a recession in '98. so to law school i went.  everybody in law school wanted to be a lawyer.  everybody but me.  of course, when all my college friends started working and just as i was getting into law school, ally mcbeal started airing in the RP so people thought i went there because i was "inspired by the show".  i'd like to think my love life wasn't  that  pathetic but i did want to have a law firm of my own with a bar upstairs where all my favorite local alternative rock bands could perform.  so ends my ally mcbeal analogy.  i finally got the hang of studying the law when i transferred to ue.  i got in a band, joined a sorority, met my girlfriend who swore she would love me forever.  forever lasted three years. anyway, i had always been sorta idealistic anyway, change the system or try to fight it at least. i appreciate my rights better now, guys think it's kinda sexy when they find out you're a law student, i can use latin to make people feel more stupid than they already are and i now know what to say when a police officer flags me down for a traffic violation.  i always said that, neurotic as i am, i am going to make a difference in this frigging world.  even though i might do an "anne heche" someday and marry a guy (like that was gonna happen anytime soon, or ever), i'd make sure there was a gay and lesbian party list in the Philippine Congress first.  i will be taking the bar exams in september.  next year we will find out if i will be able to accomplish all that i wish to achieve OR if i wasted six years of my life trying to be someone i'm not and dad's precious moolah.

         i'm pretty sure i can get this right with much difficulty. or maybe not. i'm getting the hang of this technology-filled world we live in but i don't really know if i can get used to it.    i know some things but not everything. it frustrates me. it's like when i'm studying the law, Philippine law. i know things, i know a lot of things, but not everything.  and people, my classmates, they have this way of making you feel like you don't know anything at all.  it's like when you've poured out your heart on something really really important but it can't be posted. darn.

      I am a self-confessed bisexual.  I dig both guys and girls.  At least, that’s how they define bisexuals and that’s exactly how or what I am.  Not that I am not capable of monogamy.  I am, to a certain extent, capable of loyalty and fidelity.  There are just times when I cannot control my attraction for both the opposite and the same sex.  I like men, I admire men but right now, I cannot consider marrying anytime soon.  I like women, more specifically, women who look like men (I think to most people, the term is  “butch” ).  People might find it really strange that I am this way and a lot of them have come up with theories to rationalize my behavior.  Like, “ you must’ve had a terrible experience with a guy that’s why you dig chicks ”, or “ so, you like to experiment? ” or “ do you think you’re that ugly you can’t get a guy so you’d rather date a girl? ”  Oftentimes, they are wrong and I feel it stems out from their need to feel better about themselves.  Really.  I have been this way for a very long time now and that’s the way I am.  You either love me or hate me for it.  It’s actually pretty simple:  I have come to terms with the idea that I may never get married.  Not that no guy is good enough, there are a great number of eligible single men out there.  They just don’t like me.  I’m not good enough for them.  I got sick and tired of the whole idea of making yourself available and trying to improve yourself so that a guy will like you.  Like a guy will make the ultimate sacrifice for you.  It sounds very unfair, but it’s true.  Most men wouldn’t really make that kind of sacrifice for a woman unless something was in it for them, like sex or money. If a guy likes you for who you are, that would be great, really great.  But if he doesn’t, why should I kill myself trying to make him do?  Not that I won’t try or that I’m a wuss that I won’t even exert any amount of effort to improve myself  per se , not just to get a date.  I mean, I’m already fairly attractive(i have people other than my parents telling me so); I can sing fairly well;  I know when to use ‘ their ’, ‘ there ’ and ‘ they’re ’ in a sentence plus I study Philippine law.   I can  try to improve myself some more, but I won’t try to change me into something I’m not just so some schmuck can make me his maid after letting me drop my last name.  Besides, I don’t think that there is a guy ( tall, smart, talented, sweet, sensitive, fairly attractive, and considerably well-off ) in the planet that can handle me or my neurosis long enough to actually make a life-long commitment out of it. If there is, we haven't found each other yet.  I’m also open to the idea of living in with another girl.  Lesbians can’t really get legally married in the R.P.  following the provision in our Family Code ( Marriage is a special contract of permanent union between a man and a woman . . . ).  I want to have kids, yes, that’s why there is such a thing as artificial insemination, surrogacy and adoption.  In my last relationship, I had already figured out who my sperm donor would be, what their names would be and how to tell them what brought them into this world.  Sadly, that relationship ended and while I was badly bruised, I don’t really shun the idea of me dating another lesbian again.    Right now, there is a humongous effort on the part of the people around me to try to transform me into a girl, like the “only dating men” type.  I heard that there is even this bet on which guy will get to sleep with me first, if only to prove a point that I am a girl and that the relationship with my ex-girlfriend was only a phase.  Yeah, right.  Like they know everything about me.  I don’t really get referrals because people can’t exactly tell if they should refer me to a guy or to a girl.  But I keep my options open.  Whether it’s a guy or a girl, it doesn’t really matter to me as long as we understand each other and we enjoy each other’s company.  It’s just like the way heterosexuals try to find a partner: They don’t really care if the other person is rich or poor, cute or ugly, black or white, as long as they love the person.  I’m exactly that way only I don’t limit my horizons to the men.  There are a lot of cool women out there who think the same way as I do, I just haven’t found them yet.  Lesbians and gay men already have difficulty finding acceptance in this world, especially in this country, where nobody really wants to admit to being perverse but everybody makes other people’s business their business.  I can’t exactly make them understand my views too, considering they haven’t really come to terms with the concept of gay people in general. But I’m getting by.  Thank God, not all people are closed-minded.  Not everybody will hate you just because you’re different.  Actually, some guys even find it hot.  10 out of 10 men I asked actually like the idea of two women in bed together, but not two men.  Go figure.  It’s just hard to get a date again.  It’s hard to get people off your back for liking people from both sexes.  It’s hard to make them respect you for your views.  That’s why it’s hard to by.

         My roommates, Jing and Mel and I, along with Jing’s cousins went to this bar in Timog called  Xaymaca  (it’s right across this gay bar called Gigolo-you can’t miss it unless they burn it out down and a different gay bar replaces the structure) to meet up with Jing’s cousin from Australia and his girlfriend to watch a reggae party where  urlLink Session Road  was playing.  The car ride was pretty boring. It was boring in the sense that I was two-dimensional.  Jing’s cousin Madel was a med student and Mel, of course, is a nurse so they had plenty to talk about, along with Madel’s classmate Jera who tagged along.  Jing and Raisa (who drove the car) talked about boyfriends and this Aga-Kristine chick flick “It Might Be You” (or was it “All My Life”? I don’t really give a shit), something a loveless bisexual like me cannot relate to. We arrived towards the end of the band’s first set but I got to hear them play  No Woman, No Cry, Jammin’, Waiting in Vain, King of Pain, Light My Fire , among others and some of their original songs.    I began to be bored again during intermission and was seriously contemplating going to Gweilos.  I texted Mario, the bar owner and Gweilos Hour host but he didn’t text back.  He was probably busy entertaining call center kids on a Thursday night.  I was also thinking of getting picked up. Too bad my black  “hot chick”  top failed to do the trick.  No one really gets picked up from a group; at least, that’s how I understand how the whole “picking up” thing works.  I don’t really go out much, sowee. But there were lots of beautiful people, I felt really sorry for myself that I wasn’t cute enough or that next to the med students I looked either fat or geeky (still don’t use contact lenses yet, can’t afford it) or old.  “Nope, I will not get laid tonight, poor me” , that’s how bored I felt.  I was already thinking of all the places I would rather be, I couldn’t really follow what they were talking about.  Not that I’m slow or anything, I just didn’t feel comfortable. I also thought there wasn’t gonna be a second set anymore.  Good thing I thought wrong.   A stand-up comic, Tuesday Vargas, was also there (I think she’s going out with the band’s guitarist). She sang and did the rap part of  urlLink No Doubt’s   Underneath It All  as they started the second set.  The “kids” stayed at the table outside the bar while Jing and I went back in and danced (or swayed, or gyrated, you pick the term. I just had fun; this was my type of music we were gyrating to). They also covered  urlLink 311’s  version of  urlLink The Cure’s   Love Song (Jing got a bit emotional especially when it got to the  part, ”However far away, I will always love you” ),   Santeria  by  urlLink Sublime ,  Should I Stay or Should I Go  by  urlLink The Clash ,  Dyer Maker , the  urlLink Sheryl Crow  version and a lot of other songs I can’t remember right now.  They also did some original songs but my favorite was  Suntok sa Buwan ,  which is also the design of the t-shirts they were selling. They ended their set with  Elevation  by  urlLink U2 .    we didn’t stay for the credits anymore, which is the best part about watching a live band perform after you’ve yelled and jumped all you can to their music.  I felt bad that I didn’t get to finish watching all the band members strut their stuff ‘coz the vocalist is always the last.  Hannah Romawac rocks!!!! I was falling in love with her and I wasn’t fucking able to get her to sign any of my law books. SHIT.  she connected with me  sobra ! I wanted to strangle myself with the braids of her hair.     at first i really felt bad about going.  i felt stupid for letting them drag my big neurotic ass there.  i usually go with my friends chris, beth or tina for gigs like that so i didn't expect to enjoy, but i did. i had such an adrenaline rush i kept saying that that feeling was better that sex.  maybe i'll let them drag my ass again next time  para ma-out of place uli sila sa'kin  :)

      It’s the NU 107 Independence Day Sessions. It’s happening on three different venues:  Baywalk, Mayrics, and Gweilos.  And I’m fucking stuck here in Novaliches! Not to mention, Yvonne, Erwin’s fiancé, has a short film premiering tonight and I’m gonna miss it.  Oh yeah, it started at 8pm, it’s already 9:35pm, so I just missed it.  Fuck.

         we don't like  urlLink Britney Spears  too much.  when i say "we", i mean me and my multiple personalities.  her voice sounds like she had an overdose of helium.  we're not too crazy about her songs either.  they have a tendency of staying in our head longer than usual. that's not exactly good if we're trying to memorize important provisions of the law.  my roommates keep on bugging me to sing this song that i haven't even heard of or heard in full ('coz they sing it to me sometimes in the hope that i might actually get it and sing it for them).  they want me to sing a song from an artist i don't particularly like.  they keep on telling me that it's a good song and that it applies to me in some way.  a good friend did say that she liked the song because it is good and while i don't really believe in my roommates' choices of songs (they're into R&B,   really   mushy love songs and dance, i listen to  urlLink NU 107  and  urlLink K Lite ), i do take my friend's word for it.    we checked out the lyrics, listened to a portion of it and we do appreciate the effort Miss Britney put into the song. we don't like Britney but we do keep an open mind regarding the songs we listen to :)   Everytime  Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, you're haunting me I guess I need you baby

         i just recently acquired a vcd copy of  urlLink About A Boy  as i couldn't really afford to buy the book yet and given my hectic studying schedule, i didn't really have time to read the book.  hell, i don't even have enough time to read my own law books (yet i have time to blog. hmmn . . . ). it was a cool movie and it gives me something to look forward to the moment i buy the book.  besides, if the book wasn't cool, they wouldn't really waste millions producing the film ( case in point:   urlLink The Lord of the Rings ,  urlLink Harry Potter , The Vampire Chronicles, Bridget Jones's Diary, and all those  urlLink John Grisham  books). i failed to watch the movie when it first came out.  it was one of those movies i wasn't able to watch because i didn't really have the time OR my girlfriend at the time didn't really want to watch the movie if i was the one who had to pay. of course, there were other movies we couldn't watch either because we didn't have the time or because she refused my offer to pay (Spiderman, X-2, Harry Potter, I Am Sam, etc.) so i just thought i'd buy vcd copies of them.  thanks to the wonders of cable tv, i didn't have to buy a lot.  the story touched me so much, not to mention i had the biggest crush on Hugh Grant.  it was a refreshing sight, Hugh not in his usual coat-and-tie.  he reminded me so much of a friend who, although not romantically linked to me, remains very special in my heart (special being a relative term).  i am usually an island, being an only child, i grew not having to rely on anybody so much but myself.  the boy reminded me of how i talk and sing to myself sometimes. sometimes a lot of times.  one of the other things i loved about the movie was its soundtrack by  urlLink Badly Drawn Boy .  i first heard of his songs through the  urlLink NU 107  program  Eurorock  and later, through the show  Between Planets  (which is actually just Eurorock and the station's wave '80s show, the title of which escapes my brain at the moment combined).  very soothing. i'm not really the expert in reviewing music but i have to say that my judgment as far as music is concerned ain't as lousy as my choices in relationships.  a friend of mine once sent me a message which read,  "There is a subtle fear of freedom, and everybody wants to be a slave.  Everyone, of course, talks about freedom, but no one has the courage to be really free because when you are really free you are alone. If you have the courage to be alone, then only can you be free."     i have always been alone.  i never have been scared of being an island; i have a world of my own.  but we all need backup sometimes. sometimes all the time.

         here in the RP, there are no losing election candidates, only candidates who were "cheated" of their sweet victory.  election day has long been over but the canvassing of votes in Congress hasn't even started yet and according to our Constitution, whoever the next President of the Philippines will be, he should be proclaimed by June 30 of this year.  with all the hoopla as to how the rules of canvassing should be construed, it looks like the winning candidate won't be known until maybe next year.  a great number of accusations from both the opposition and the administration have been hurdled out as to who is cheating on who(sounds like a telenovela) and who the real winning candidate is.  it's a legal battle and i find it funny that all these lawyers who teach us how to interpret the law properly and who write books about the law are the first ones to distort it.  i would not even dare to enumerate the instances where i feel the law was bent or interpreted differently than the way it should be for i am still on the path of becoming a lawyer; i don't presume to know everything.  but that's the whole point, i am reviewing for the bar and if the fates are kind, i will become a lawyer come 2005.  six years of law school and i feel like i still don't know a thing.  how can we let someone who didn't even finish high school but who gets by because of his popularity take control of our country? what bothers me is the fact that, if FPJ wins after all, how will he manage our economy?  is he really going to be the one to control everything or is this where his puppet masters come in? i am not one to diss people because of their race, creed(i barely go to my own church), sexual preference (the last time i checked, i'm still a bisexual) or educational attainment (i had an ex-boyfriend who lived in the slums. he worked as a backride for those  "hataw"  jeeps in novaliches.  he took a vocational course in radio technology but he didn't really have much of a backbone.  all he did was play basketball, ride the jeep and womanize. i loved him very much, but there really wasn't much we could talk about).  i respect people for who and what they are, i just hate it when people take advantage of their popularity and turn it into a political goldmine.  the senators who won in the recent election were mostly actors, offsprings of other political figures or people who dated really famous celebrities (although we have to give props to Senator Mar Roxas, he really does work.  they didn't call him Mr. Palengke for nothing) while the former framers of our laws, the really good ones, didn't even make the top 15.   FPJ is a good man who should take defeat gracefully. if his intentions are authentic, he doesn't need public office to help the millions of Filipinos suffering from poverty and injustice.  i'd like to have a gay and lesbian party list representative in Philippine Congress but i don't have to be the one to sitting in Congress.  if one wants to make a difference in society it doesn't mean that running for councilor,  kagawad , senator, congressman, or President is the only way of making it happen.  there are other ways.  helping people doesn't always come with a photo opp.  believe me, these things don't really go unnoticed.   i'd like to think the Filipino people have matured and have voted wisely.  we will never really know until our politicians are done canvassing the votes.  4 days and counting . . .

      i'm having a lot of trouble studying since i get so out of focus.  this is the only time i get to go out because i get to stay in the dorm and i don't have to worry about curfew.  i get to see my friends, watch a lot of gigs and just drink, basically.  i know i shouldn't be doing these things anymore because i should be studying but i will grow more insane than i already am if i don't.  i can't really study in the ue law library.  for a library, it sure is very noisy. i haven't gotten rid of my status as a quasi-public figure.  people still know me and talk to me and shit.  they especially still ask me about my ex, which gives me mixed emotions.  i mean, come on, it's been six fucking months and they still don't have an idea that we're not together anymore?!  and some of them are just plain insensitive. some irritate me by telling me that they saw my ex with the girl and that i'm probably so hurt and shit.  some keep telling me that i deserve better and that i should just focus on my studies while others just poke fun at my appearance, that i'm probably so hurt and bitter i keep on taking it out on my hair.  there are others who are genuinely concerned about me and tell me that i look better and that i'm blooming and all those other things which they try to say because they think it will make me feel better.  i am losing weight, whether consciously or unconsciously, and i do try to make myself better but i'm not fucking bitter.  why don't they just leave me alone?  i've been alone most of my life, i'm an only child.  i've learned to be independent at an early age.  if they're not used to me being alone because they got so used to me being with my girlfriend all those four years in law school, it's not my frigging fault.  people break up.  there's no such thing as forever.  forever ended in November 10, 2003.  they should just pray for me that i pass the bar and move on.  i mean, i've been trying to move on. maybe they should too.

      the bad thing about being single, aside from the fact that i no longer get laid on a regular basis is the fact that i’m back in high school again. not literally, but the whole idea that i have crushes again and  i’m  relegated to that status where the guy i like doesn’t acknowledge my existence, no matter how smart, cute, nice or sexy  i am or could be.  fuck. i become so  pa-girl  and i wasn’t even like that when i actually was in high school!  i was just basically ignored a lot ‘coz i didn’t cash in on my appearance to get the guy.  oh yeah, i never really got the guy.  i should just probably study for the bar.

      When I was younger, everybody took me seriously.  Well, everyone who bothered to pay attention to me took me seriously that nobody noticed how beautiful I can be.  Now everybody, almost everybody thinks I’m pretty that nobody seems to take me seriously anymore, nobody bothers to see how deep and intellectual I can be.    Well, being beautiful has its price.    Guess you can’t have your cake and eat it too.    *nuninu*    I have so much faith in people.  People have disappointed me so many times and yet I still trust people, sometimes to the detriment of my life.  When I enter into a discussion about life I am not surprised that I tend to shock people.  I don’t exactly expect them to have the same views that I have, why should we?  That’s what individual differences are for, diversity of opinion.  When I talk about sex, I take it educationally.  When I talk about men, I mean to diss but I express hope.  When I talk about homosexual relationships, I don’t talk about permanence, I talk about respect.  I respect other people’s opinion much as I want to be respected for what I believe in.  I keep a good idea about other people in my head as much as I want to be remembered in a good way.  I’m not the most perfect person in the planet. I have flaws.  I’d like to think that sometimes, it’s the person’s imperfections that endear him to people.  I just hope that’s what people think whenever they think of me.  But then again, I put too much faith in people and they have always disappointed me.  So much for man being inherently good.  How about inherently evil?  I’m just glad that I have friends that think I’m good enough, people who think I’m smart and sensual at the same time; people who know my flaws and live with them.  I know I can be a pain at times.   I  AM ME.

      photos don't necessarily reveal a person's true feelings.  one could be smiling from ear to ear but then that person could be pissed or miserable as hell.  the eyes give you away.  notice from these pictures how happy or excited i am, apparently.  but then, i was bored as hell.  you can tell by the number of cigarettes i'm smoking how pissed or bored or elated i am.     i didn't wanna go really.  but jing, my roommate insisted.  i could've just read my notes, my law books or drank my novellino.  it was my red wine anyway, if i sucked the bottle dry, it was mine.  i also wasn't financially beautiful.  i'm not too crazy about this Divo guy (you're not Marc Abaya, you James Ingram wannabe!!!) or MYMP to actually withdraw money for a gimmick like this.  besides,   he who invites must pay.    i don't really drag people's butts with me to go places unless i know i can take care of them.  jing obviously did not know this.  mel, dhancy and i couldn't really order more than we would've liked because of financialy incapacity.    yeah, i'm smiling.  but it took a while before i became animated. and i had this "surprise date".  he was nice.  but we were both touchy feely that they actually thought we were hitting it off already. or that we kissed. NAH.  i was on my best behavior last night.  and i did try to enjoy. but i was so fucking bored. he did say he was gonna set me up with his officemates.  yeah, but he was doing most of the touching.     when we got home i had this really bad headache.  i could've finished civil procedure already, or just went to Mayric's or gotten laid.  anything else but not as boring as that.  we were so tired just sitting there.     smiles don't really mean one had a good time.

      1. Faith is the ability to not panic.  2. If you worry, you didn't pray. If you pray, don't worry.  3. As a child of God, prayer is kind of like calling home every day.  4. Blessed are the flexible, for they shall not be bent out of shape.  5. When we get tangled up in our problems, be still.God wants us to be still so He can untangle the knot.  6. Do the math. Count your blessings.  7. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.  8. Dear God: I have a problem. It's me.  9. Silence is often misinterpreted, but never misquoted.  10. Laugh every day, it's like inner jogging.  11. The most important things in your home are the people.  12. Growing old is inevitable, growing up is optional.  13. There is no key to happiness. The door is always open.  14. A grudge is a heavy thing to carry.  15. He who dies with the most toys is still dead.  16. We do not remember days, but moments. Life moves  too fast, so enjoy your precious moments.  17. Nothing is real to you until you experience it, otherwise it's just hearsay.  18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just be sure to flush when you are done.  19. Surviving and living your life successfully requires courage. The goals and dreams you're seeking require courage and risk-taking. Learn from the turtle -- it only makes progress when it sticks out its neck.  20. Be more concerned with your character than your reputation. Your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

      The results of the 2002 Bar Examinations and a very humiliating assessment of UE’s performance posted on the internet has got me and a great number of people talking, thinking and working together in order to put UE back on the map.  On its good side, of course.  I am probably the only transferee who loves UE more than I love the school that kicked me out.  I mean, it’s expected from transferees to feel a bit of resentment against San Beda or UP or Ateneo or UST but somehow, they still feel they belong there.  No school spirit.  A lot of it, I think, stems from the fact that UE is so org-based that they think the only reason they can assure themselves support, moral, financial, or otherwise, is if they work together, as a basic unit and not as a whole UE community.  Like I always say, when people from UE pass the bar, or God help us, even top the bar, the newspapers will not indicate John Doe, member of this or that fraternity or Jane Dela Cruz, transferee from this or that school.  Rather, it will say, paquita motivo, UE Law.  Come on, the school administration may not love and support the UE Barristers, but we should shove it in their face that we love the school.   “The next time you feel like CHATTING OR MAKING UNNECESSARY NOIISE IN THE LIBRARY, take a good look at the results of the recent bar examinations, IT WILL SHUT YOU UP.   The LIBRARY IS A PLACE FOR STUDYING. Let us all keep it that way”  I plan to have this announcement posted on the bulletin board next to the article posted “Why UE Failed the Bar”.  I hate the way the UE people don’t take their studies seriously, the way they don’t take their classmates seriously enough to respect them.  No wonder other schools don’t take UE, with emphasis on DON’T.  They, I repeat, do not take US, UE Law students seriously, because we don’t take US seriously.   N.B.  i'm gonna take the bar this September and i still feel this way

      i’d like to think, think being the operative word, that i have lots of friends.  i actually do, mostly girls and gays who have known me through the years.  i also have some straight male friends, actually.  what bothers me though, is the fact that while i consider them special, i might not be as special to them as they are to me, unlike my female and gay friends.  they’re really great guys but i don’t think they even know when my birthday is (it’s in August, Jules, Jose).  i want someone who will take me on anything, someone i could call or text in the middle of the night because i’m scared shitless of something or someone or just basically sick of studying, someone i could discuss the meaning of life with, not necessarily husband material, just someone who’d talk to me and give me advice the moment i do look for a husband (like i said, like it’ll ever happen) and who’d give me away just in case i do get married and my dad’s gone (whichever comes first).  i do have a   “no-touch”   policy with my male friends ‘coz i could be a very sensual person and i think it was the great janeane garofalo who said in the movie “Reality Bites”  that   “sex is the quickest way to ruin a friendship”  .  so i don’t touch them, even if the circumstances call for spontaneous combustion.  but i do have an   “unless”   clause :)   qualifications:   ·	must be able to handle my neurosis  ·	should be  tall  (so he can make fun of my height),  smart  (‘coz i do want to discuss the economy.  that or the dumb new show on cable),  handsome  (nothing wrong with fairly attractive, not looking for drop dead gorgeous, just okay looking so that when some guy bugs me, he can pretend to be my boyfriend),  nice  (to complement my bitchness),  sensitive  (will hug me or offer his shoulder when i just got dumped by my partner) and  funny  (not the slapstick kind of funny)  ·	knows how to play the guitar (because i’m a lousy guitar player)  ·	must be musically inclined (not necessarily listens to rock too, but is preferred, so he can drive me home after i watch late night gigs)  ·	must know basic martial arts (‘coz even if i know how to kick people’s butts, he should be able to kick mine)  ·	must tell me if my blouse or skirt is too revealing and will tell me to change (but will check me out secretly as i’m changing hehehehe)  ·	must not be afraid of ghosts, cockroaches, rats, frogs, people  ·	will tell me that a guy/girl is not good for me without sounding like my gay or female friends  ·	smokes and drinks occasionally (because i do too)  ·	doesn’t do drugs  ·	has high respect for women, gays and lesbians and everyone else  ·	doesn’t think Sports Illustrated and FHM counts as literature  ·	must actually accept me for who i am, otherwise, we wouldn’t exactly be friends

      finally, a rock love song duet.  thanks to the movie, The Punisher, we now have a rock song that is a love song that is a duet.  not so cheesy, not so hard, but it gives you chills when you hear it because the feelings are so heartfelt.     Broken  Seether featuring Amy Lee  I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away I keep your photograph; I know it serves me well I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away You've gone away, you don't feel me, anymore  The worst is over now and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, you steal my pain away There’s so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high and steal your pain  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open  And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m open And I don’t feel like I am strong enough ‘Cause I’m broken when I’m lonesome And I don’t feel right when you’re gone away  'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away You've gone away You don't feel me here anymore

          June 26, 2004  The weather kinda indicated that things wouldn’t exactly go well but we pushed through with it anyway:  after sooo many years and sooo many gimmicks, Patrick Joseph Santos decided to come down and join the earthlings for a while.  When I say earthlings, I mean, Chris, Beth and of course,  moi .  This was our first gimmick together after all those years.  There was bound to be a lot of milestones.  All of them left undocumented, damnit.  Patrick showing up. Bels all made up and slutty.   Beth without her boyfriend.  Chris dancing.       We met at Camp White. Well, actually, Beth and Chris met up at Mcdo Araneta, where they were supposed to wait for me.  Unfortunately, my roommates had other plans and made me up.  They picked me up at Legarda where suspicious looking people were behind me.  I was terribly late and as a consequence I was gonna pay for cab fare.  I, who did not have money.  But I was so scared of getting picked up, either by really perverted strangers or by the cops for allegedly soliciting.  We met Patrick at Camp White.  I didn’t know until late that Camp White was gay territory, specifically, gay men.  I WASN'T GONNA GET LAID AGAIN, I KNEW IT.  I have never seen sooo many gay men in my entire life.  They were all flooding the dance floor.  Camp White was for fags and their hags, or if lucky, their dates.    We ordered beer and as usual, Patrick wouldn’t offer to pay the first round of beers. And he looked so masculine, or at least trying to appear masculine.  To think he was such a slut when I graduated.  Immediately you could see the 4V divide.  Beth was talking to Patrick, I was talking to Chris.  You could also tell that Beth was still so much in love with Patrick and his butch image aroused her to new heights. Then arrived Erwin, Patrick’s ex and Jay, Erwin’s friend whom according to Chris was Erwin’s new lover.  The plot thickens.  ( N. B.  this is why I don’t or haven’t written anything about my lovely friends.  I can’t stop laughing.  No, seriously, I love my friends.  Everything is just sooo telenovela, that’s all.  Particularly this episode.)   Chris told me that Patrick was still a virgin, according to Patrick, of course. So I had to ask.  And I had to whisper.  And I just had to hit the beer bottle by accident spilling SanMig Light on Erwin.  That was the first time I got a gay guy wet, literally. There’s always a first time for everything.  We went to the very crowded dance floor.  It was full of gay men and while the idea of gay men rubbing themselves against each other fascinated and excited me a little, I couldn't breathe.  besides,  walang career dito .  I told Chris we'd just meet him after the show or whatever.   I love gay men.  My closest friends are gay.  But a gay man and a bisexual don't mix so off to the gig site Beth and I went.  We learned later that Patrick ran off and left Chris in the sea of gay men alone.

      It was a tiring long walk from Camp White to the Baywalk Area where the alternative concerts were held.  I dragged Beth’s butt away because we wouldn’t exactly see some action with anyone in the gay area.  It was a very long walk but I walked it, alongside Beth, of course.  She couldn’t exactly walk behind me for fear of being mistaken as my “yaya”.  We could already hear Kitchie Nadal howling which was a sign that the alternative bands weren’t too far away anymore. It’s too bad we couldn’t see the band from where we were standing.  Not only was Kitchie hot, but she had an even hotter bassist. We arrived in the Raja Sulayman fountain area just as Session Road was setting up.  Had to check if the housemates were still at Shakey’s where I sampled their leftover pizza.  Saw Jeffrey Hidalgo with his posse on the way in.  He looks better in person; TV appearances don’t give the guy justice.      After saying goodbye to my housemates, Beth and I went out to see Session Road perform.  I kept on telling Beth how good the band was when I saw them perform at Xaymaca.  I really like their original stuff. We had to look for an okay spot; we were so tired of standing up.  We finally did find a spot, next to the jolog rockers just as the Itchyworms were starting their set.  I enjoyed their set.   Beth was enjoying herself although she kept on texting the boyfriend, trying to make him envious of all the bands we were watching play that night.  She was telling me how she absolutely adores bassists and how hot she gets whenever she watches the boyfriend play with his bass guitar.  “Makes me want to jump on him right then and there”, were her words.  Too much info, sweetie.  Sugarfree performed next and while I wasn’t really familiar with some of the new songs that they played, I looked forward to their new album.  I didn’t hear  Unang Araw  and  Telepono , but  Mariposa  kicks ass talaga.      After Sugarfree performed and the next band, Sandwich, was doing sound check, I kinda hinted to Beth that since this was a Studio23 shindig, Marc Abaya wasn’t gonna show up, Marc being an MTV VJ.  But when the guy said”Check!” I knew it was him.  It was Marc!!! The stupid guy VJ whom we couldn’t really see kept on talking about Sandwich in reference to their new single,  Two Trick Pony .  It was as if it was the only Sandwich song he knew because the man kept on displaying his ignorance.    They started their set with my all-time favorite  Butterfly Carnival , from the first album  Grip, Stand, Throw .  Jeez, these jolog rockers talaga, after all these years and after all the frigging mosh-pitting and they still can’t get the fucking lyrics right.  Beth wasn’t too familiar with the Sandwich songs anymore so I had to “voice over” every time a new song was done.  They played  Right Now , from their indie album  Thanks to the Moon’s   Gravitational Pull .  It was during this song that something peculiar happened:  a guy wearing nothing but his white underwear and a left shoe (? this is according to Beth, ‘coz I couldn’t really see anymore) stood in the middle of the remaining road open (they had to close the south bound road to make way for the audience), raising his hands and dancing to the tune of Sandwich until nobody was paying attention to the band anymore.  Scene-stealer. Hmp.   For a while, the mosh pit cleared because everybody was surrounding this guy, and traffic was already bad enough as it is.  He went on until Nahuhulog was playing and then he was covered by so many people we didn’t see him anymore.  Sandwich ended their set with, yes, now you can say it, you stupid VJ,   Two Trick Pony  .  I sooo love Marc Abaya!!!     The main event was Kapatid, led by Karl Roy.  I wonder if he’s still dating Mariel.  Anyway, their set was good too.  I asked Beth to walk with me as we were listening to Karl because I didn’t want to get mobbed as soon as everybody left.  They did  Ang Himig Natin  and, to my surprise, an old P.O.T. song,  Fishcake , before ending the whole event with  Pagbabalik ng Kuwago .  It was a good thing God let the rains pour only after the show ended.  I didn’t want to get wet again.  at least, not that way anyway :)

         Adia     &nbsp; by    urlLink   Sarah McLachlan             &nbsp;    Adia I do believe I failed you  Adia I know I let you down  don't you know I tried so hard  to love you in my way  it's easy let it go...   Adia I'm empty since you left me  trying to find a way to carry on  I search myself and everyone  to see where we went wrong   'cause there's no one left to finger  there's no one here to blame  there's no one left to talk to honey  and there ain't no one to buy our innocence  'cause we are born innocent  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  it's easy, we all falter  does it matter?   Adia I thought we could make it  but I know I can't change the way you feel  I leave you with your misery  a friend who won't betray  I pull you from your tower  I take away your pain  and show you all the beauty you possess  if you'd only let yourself believe that  we are born innocent  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  it's easy, we all falter, does it matter?  believe me Adia, we are still innocent  'cause we are born innocent  Adia we are still  it's easy, we all falter ... but does it matter?     when i first the song Adia by Sarah McLachlan, i thought it was:  a) a lesbian break up song;  b)&nbsp;a song about sexual abuse; or  c) a song about broken friendships.  &nbsp;  a song is always open to different interpretations but when i heard about the movie  urlLink Monster  , i said to myself, "wonderful! a movie that fits the song to a T".&nbsp; i haven't really watched the film, i don't think it was ever shown here in the R.P. but&nbsp; i have heard its story over and over from friends and you sorta wonder, did they use Adia for the soundtrack?  &nbsp;     look at this:&nbsp; Aileen Wournos was a prostitute&nbsp; who never felt loved when she was growing up.&nbsp; she meets Selby Wall, who became her girlfriend. later on, Selby, her only trusted friend and lover betrays her.&nbsp; it's so sad yet so gripping (my frail attempt at film review and to think i didn't even get to see the film). i mean, i could relate to both the story and the song, not that i was ever a prostitute who killed her clients, but i did have to work to sustain my three-year lesbian relationship.   i may never ever get to see this film, but i will always get to listen to sarah mclachlan.&nbsp;and everytime i do get to&nbsp; hear the song, i'd remember the film and the story of the woman who loved so much she'd kill for it.

      I have this friend who used to be involved with me.  If you ask her if we were a thing before, she’d tell you no, because as far as she was concerned, we weren’t.  We just happened to exchange epiglottises in her car just to piss my then girlfriend off.  Anyway, we didn’t talk for a year but I did call her up after my ex broke up with me.  To blame her, to vent, to talk.  We were friends.  Besides, when she was having problems with her girlfriend, she talked to me, to vent, to cry, to talk.  I was under the impression that she understood me and had the capacity to clear my head.  When I was trying to hide from my girlfriend (  translation:  “I want to be alone”  ), I was with her.  She made me see things I couldn’t admit to myself because I was so madly in love with the ex.    She told me that we’d talk or at least keep in touch, when she and her live-in girlfriend split up.  Not so much so that I could get into the picture but so that we would be able to talk freely.  Her girlfriend had the knack of being jealous of everybody (my, uh, “friend” was such a slut anyway.  She could easily get away with cheating because the girlfriend would believe her and declare war against anyone who supposedly flirts with her hubby.   Sweetie, wake up and smell the coffee!  Sometimes, it’s YOUR GIRLFRIEND who does the flirting and you buy her puppy eyes whenever she lies to you!!! )Which is why I can’t exactly call her up or text her if the  kumander  is there.    However, they were supposedly going to be separated from bed and board.   My friend never really texted me, called or emailed me if it pushed through or not, because I did want to console her.  Besides, I got problems too and I was under the impression (false impressions.   I stand by what I said:  people have never failed to disappoint me. ) that I was important enough to be informed if they got back together or if it was okay to text or not.    I’m obviously not as important as she said I was.  It’s obviously one of those lines she uses on everybody.  Hell, I fell for it.  If not for anything, I thought she was my friend.  I thought wrong.  So it’s my turn, HON, to say your 7 favorite words:  DON’T WORRY, I WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE.     nuninu    People are natural editors.  They have this knack for adding or subtracting from statements so that something totally simple turns out to be complicated.  People leave out important details to save themselves.  Ever wonder how one story can have several different versions?  this is exactly what happened among my roommates and me.  i wasn't exactly fighting with anyone, they were at each other's throats. as much as possible,  i don't take sides because it's not fair and i wouldn't really want people to take my side if i was wrong.  hell, i'm always wrong.  anyway, i only react based on information given to me.  if i am given wrong information, i give the wrong reaction.  it's just like how a computer works - GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.  i explain myself to them and i try as much as i can to listen to both sides and try to defend the other when the other speaks about the other badly.  but then, what i said was completely distorted and it ended up horribly.  it looked like i made them fight over something as trivial as using maxipeel and who should wash the dishes, etc.  i feel so betrayed and they felt i betrayed them.  it's dirty, and i don't even like to wash my dirty linen in public.  i feel so bad and angry.  oh well, people have disappointed me once again.    nuninu    I love my law school.  If fortunate to pass the bar exams, or even top it, I will not only wear my gay colors proudly, but I will scream to the top of my lungs my roots.  what pisses me off about my beloved law school is the fact that they don't exactly take care of its barristers (and they wonder why we have such a low passing percentage).  i have seen this all the four years i've worked as a  member of the bar operations committee.  the system hasn't changed.  all other law schools get the support they need, financial and otherwise from their school administrations, but not us.  we have to be the one to fix our papers, we have to pay for everything and we have to take the frigging exam.  not to mention, we're the ones they blame solely for the embarrassing performance when not all of us will pass. wonderful.  i've said this before, if the students don't take themselves seriously, the other schools won't respect us either.  but how can we develop that respect if our own school administration doesn't think we're good enough?

      	Tuesday morning.  The ray of sunlight seeping through the blinds woke Celina up.  She could barely figure out what made her body ache the way it did as she glanced at the time.  	“Ohmigod!  It’s already 8:00 am!!!  Cynthia! Cynthia!”  No reply.  Nowhere to be found was the man she spent the night with.  He left a note though, “thank you, whoever you are.”  She couldn’t remember his name either:  Roy, Eric, Randy, whatever.  She reached for a pack of cigarettes – empty.  She would only have scotch today.  Her cat’s meow reminded her that she was alone, and that her younger sister was on a symposium.  Chelsea wouldn’t be back until Saturday.  She pours wine on her glass again and looks at the picture of Ronald, her greatest love.  They were supposed to get married when he met an accident on the ever of their wedding day.  When they recovered Ronald’s body, they found out that he had been drinking.  What hurt Celina more was that her best friend Sophia died with Ronald.  Only then did she know about their affair and that Ronald was breaking up with Sophia that night.  	Their mother thought it best for Chelsea to stay with Celina to help her recover.  Celina didn’t have any serious relationships afterwards, but she had lots of flings. Most of them she’d met at a bar or at a disco and they would proceed to her place, just like the guy who left.  Celina made love to them even though they hardly knew each other.  	She glanced at Ronald’s picture again.  “This is all your fault.”  She cries as she gulps the remaining contents of her glass.  *** 	“Good morning, Gina.”  Celina greeted her secretary.  She knew that a ton of papers was waiting for her to sign as she walked into her office.  Lighting a cigarette, she began to work.  She had been so engrossed that she did not notice a co-worker and college friend enter the room.  	“I thought you were gonna kick the habit goodbye,” he said.  	“Oh, it’s you.  I didn’t know I was being watched.  Well, it kinda gets me relaxed.  How long have you been there?”  	“Enough to know that it’s your fourth stick.  Hey, listen, it you don’t have any plans, why don’t we do lunch?” his eyes beaming in anticipation.  	“Oh, not today, Andrew.  I came in late already so I might just stay here and skip lunch.  Maybe some other time.  Thanks anyway.”  	“Well, okay then, don’t want to keep you from your job.  I’ll see you.”  And then he walked out of her office.  She’s still tough, he thought.  	He had liked her ever since college but it was only after Ronald’s death that he had mustered the courage to ask her out.  It hurt him to see her self-destruct and he wanted to be the one to fill the void in her life.  She was everything he had wanted in a woman:  beautiful, intelligent, kind.  But she could only see him as a friend.  Great.   She’d go out with almost every guy she meets. Why won’t she go out with me?  *** 	Chelsea didn’t want to leave her sister in such an imbalanced state, but her boss required her to represent their company in the week-long symposium in Laguna.    	Ronald and Sophia’s death was a big blow to Celina.  It transformed her into a loose woman.  Chelsea had been telling Celina to quit smoking but she wouldn’t listen.  Now she’s been drinking wine for breakfast.  She wonders how her sister can still manage a firm with the kind of life she leads.  Worst of all, it had been her sister’s habit to bring home a guy she met somewhere in the middle of the night doing God-knows-what.  Her sister was slowly becoming a whore.  The only difference was that it seemed like she was the one paying for their services.  Chelsea tried to convince herself that her sister was just going through a phase, that it was just her way of coping with the loss of her boyfriend and her best friend.  	 I wonder how she’s holding up , she thought.   She can’t just sleep with any guy she meets . . .   	“The project will commence on the second day of March, 2001 . . .” the words of the speaker just went right through her, she was barely listening.  	 What if she gets STD?  Or worse, AIDS?  What if she comes across a maniac or something?  What if –   	“Is the discussion boring you, Miss Perez?” Miss Perez?”  	“Oh, what?  Oh, no, I’m sorry.  I’m very sorry.”  She blushed in embarrassment.  *** 	The woman could hardly move.  At first, she was very enthusiastic with this particular session for her new client had drop-dead good looks enough to make her mouth water.  More so, she was getting paid to enjoy herself.  But now, she thanked God it was finally over.  She couldn’t believe what hit her, literally.  She slowly crawled out of bed and reached for the dresser.  A thousand bucks.  A thousand bucks wasn’t enough to repair her face and heal the excruciating pain she felt.  She had been horrible sodomized by what looked like a perfectly normal human being searching for fun.    	“I’ve been ripped off!!!”  *** 	Walking out of the motel room was a very satisfied man, smiling and smoking.  His name is jay, real estate broker by day, madman by night.  This was not the first time he had abused someone sexually, not would it be the last.  He enjoyed the idea of women and gays swooning over him and the sound of their screams after he is through with them.  He is motivated by anger that is never ending and he will not stop until he has had his fill.  *** 	Five-thirty pm.  It’s a Friday.  Everyone is rushing out of the office, except Celina.   They must not know which bar I’m going to.  I can’t risk my reputation.   	Ever since Ronald died she has not found anyone who could fill the void he left.  She couldn’t even tell the difference between love and lust now.  Chelsea asked her to stop the pattern she developed with guys, but now, she just can’t.  I’ll hurt them the same way they hurt me, she said to herself.  But who could she hurt now, if Ronald and Sophia are both dead?  ***  	 A lot of matrons will come her, women with no dates, gays looking for pleasure, that wouldn’t be so bad , Jay thought.  He is on the lookout for his next victim.  Suddenly, a beautiful woman walked inside the bar, alone.  She stroked her hair so gracefully and slowly made her entrance.  Divine, he thought.  The woman sat right beside him and asked for a drink.  	“Cosmo, please.”  She must have sensed the pair of eyes staring at her so she smiled.  Greg started to make his move.  	“Why is it that beautiful women end up being alone on nights like these?” he asked.  	“I don’t know, a curse, maybe.  And you, what’s your excuse?”  	“Well, I don’t consider it a curse.  For one, it’s actually a good opportunity to meet lovely people like you.  I’m Greg Panganiban, and you are?”  	“Celina Perez.  Are you always this cocky?”  	“Not really.  But if I weren’t some other guy would’ve been here giving you an even lamer line….”  And they both laughed.  	“Seriously now, why are you alone?”  Greg was so fascinated with this woman.  He swears never to hurt her if he had the chance.  	“Some stupid guy dumped me for someone else.” She replied.  	“Well, I couldn’t be caught committing that mistake.  Why don’t we go somewhere so we could talk?  It’s pretty noisy in here.”  She easily gave in to the request.”  	“Sure.  We can go to my place.”  ***  	Celina had had been so astounded by the way this man carried himself around her.  He had been so gentle with the way he held her hand as they walked out of the bar and escorted her to her car.  A real gentleman.  Little did she know she was in for the time of her life.  Or what could possibly end it.  *** 	 	Greg promised himself that he would behave for he could not bear to lose this woman with whom he had been badly smitten.  He kissed her gently and she followed his every motion.  Everything was going fine when suddenly, a red film flashed before his eyes and he could hear a voice beckoning him to hurt her.   Hit her, Greg.  Hit   her hard.    After that, he could not tell what was happening anymore.  He could only hear the screams of a woman fighting back.    	“Oh, please, stop.  You’re hurting me . . . you’re hurting me . . .” He was pounding on something over and over.   That’s it, that’s good.  Show them who’s the man.   The feeling elated Greg.    The red film cleared and he saw a woman terribly bruised and blue.  Blood was all over the room. Horrified, he walked out of the house.  	Celina could not believe what was happening to her.  He had hit her so many times, she could not fight back. She was too weak.  She screamed for help but her cries fell on deaf ears.    	“Help!  Stop, please.  Stop it!  stop please!  Stop . . ………stop…………”  And then everything was black.  ***  	Saturday morning.  Cynthia dropped by the grocery before heading home.   I hope everything’s alright.  She really missed her sister.  She admitted how Celina could be a real pain in the ass but deep inside she was a very remarkable person.  She hurriedly took the key out of her bag but was surprised to see that the door was open.  Something was jamming the door.  She pushed some more and she was finally able to go in.    	“Ohmigod, Chloe!”  The cat was lying there, all bloodied.  “Celina!  Celina!!”  She rushed to her sister’s room, her heart throbbing, her hands trembling.  “NNNNOOOO!!!!!”     N. B.  This was originally written in 1997, to be submitted to the author’s editors then.  It’s pretty obvious why the work was rejected.  This was written at the time when the author had no idea what a bar looks like, how it feels like to be picked up, sodomized or beaten up to death.  Now, the author has been to a number of bars, her favorites being Gweilo’s and Mayric’s (most bars that she’s been to have now closed:  Phenomena, Kampo, and Hobbit Hideaway has a new owner).  Thankfully, she has not yet been picked up to be sodomized or beaten up to death :)

      thank God for sanitary napkins.  i am just so grateful to the wise ass who put cottonlike material together, put adhesive on it so that women like me can have protection whenever it's that time of the month.  it's one hell of a scientific breakthrough.  not the telephone or the light bulb although i cannot imagine what it would be like to change your sanitary napkins in the dark.  the blood, the gore. what a frigging mess that would be, i bet.  monthly period also gives a sort of lame excuse (although women do get away with it, sorry guys) for women to act in a not-so-acceptable manner.  they can bitch (but i must say i can do that with or without the monthly period), they can be horny, they piss you off and shit and it can be easily attributed to PMS.  i love it but i hate the fucking cramps and abdominal pains.  it makes me wonder, how the hell can i be great mother if i don't want to experience the pain of giving birth which i hear is like ten times more painful than what women experience on a monthly basis? makes me wish the stork stories were actually true.    *nuninu*    i love my friends.  i've said it a zillion times. sometimes the people who aren't exactly related to you, they're the ones who understand you better.  they're the ones who help you when you need something.  well, most of the time.  blood   is   thicker than water, no doubt about that.  but water can turn into gas, or solid, blood can't.

      being a bisexual doesn't pay.&nbsp; well, i have no problems with me.&nbsp; i have problems with other people.&nbsp; they tend to give you really insensitive comments and judge you simply because they can't begin to fathom what your life is like.   last thursday, i got really pissed&nbsp;with my former classmate in remedial law review.&nbsp; he always made fun of me and my break up during class breaks and i joke around with him too.&nbsp; it gave him the impression that since i wasted time talking to him he was actually relevant.&nbsp; he's nice and probably likeable.&nbsp; except for the fact that he always made it point to make fun of me, like those conversations made my life a little less miserable.&nbsp;he&nbsp;rubs it in my face that i'm bitter that my ex got me replaced before i could say czechoslovakia.&nbsp; &nbsp;i think he gets off that way (thank God, i can do it alone!).  anyway, they, meaning he and his frat brods do notice how cute i've become ever since the breakup so they always joke around about visiting me in the dorm.&nbsp; i don't really mind, as long as they bring their own food and source of entertainment.&nbsp;   thursday, july 15, 2004, he jokes about visiting me in the dorm again.&nbsp; then he says, "Bels, your tummy's getting bigger, are you pregnant?&nbsp; would you like me to get you pregnant?"&nbsp; that does it.&nbsp; i hit him in the right shoulder because 1) he was able to duck and hide his face; and 2) i'm gonna take the fucking bar exams.&nbsp; if i slapped him in the face that would be slander by deed and he wins.&nbsp;   i hate comments like that.&nbsp; i don't associate myself with lower life forms and comments like that come mostly from heterosexual male chauvinist freaks who have no mojo.&nbsp; he's tall, he plays good basketball, he's fairly attractive although nothing in this life is fair.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have no respect for him.&nbsp; he will probably pass the bar because he's smart but he has no respect for people who are different like me.&nbsp; people always hate things and people they cannot understand.&nbsp; and to mask that fear , that ignorance, they make fun of you.&nbsp; that ain't so smart.

       I first wrote to Erwin last year, I can’t remember the exact date. I just thought I’d email him about my life, particularly, my break up with my lesbian ex. It probably aroused his interest because we emailed each other a couple of times before we actually met. I just thought I’d write to him because he was my age and he kinda listened to the stuff I listened to and we both knew Mondo Castro (The Pin-up Girls vocalist, former Ang TV star, former NU107 DJ, currently the host of Between Planets). I had also been listening to their show religiously although, to be quite honest, I know zilch of the songs they play on the show. But the show grew on me. You learn something new every day and every Friday from then on, I was hooked. Not so much the songs, they were great, but I was actually after the conversations. It wasn’t until I read a feature on his two older siblings that I realized that I was writing to that Romulo. He’s related to the Romulo who was the&nbsp;first Filipino Secretary-General&nbsp;in the United Nations and the Romulo who was running the government when GMA was campaigning.   That Romulo.     Once in his show, when Mondo became a guest, he mentioned that I’m a nice girl who should write his columns for him. Coming from someone who’s probably read ALL the books in his room, having learned how to read as early as age three, who studied in a school I couldn’t get in twice (UP, first for college, second for law) in my lifetime (I’m scarred for life!), writes a column for one for the most prestigious papers in the city, uses words I have never even heard of, and for him to say that on  NATIONAL RADIO , that is such an honor for me. I feel very flattered. I don’t get too many compliments, especially not like that.   I visited him, along with his co-host, Mario, the Gweilo’s owner, &nbsp;some time in the summer. April 30, 2004, to be exact. After the show I told him he owed me a beer. He said he’d treat me right after we: 1) go to his house to fix something; and 2) pick up his fiancée. I helped him finish edit his Palanca entry. He kept on telling me he didn’t know how he’d be able to edit it without my help (page insert, delete, bold. Being the daughter of a man who owns a computer shop can be very handy). I even met his dad. I felt like such an idiot shaking his old man’s hand. He was asking me where in Quezon City&nbsp;I was &nbsp;residing and from what district and I kept saying sorry because I didn’t have the slightest clue. I mean, how can anyone be anymore retarded than that?! I can’t believe all these rich people let me into their house when I could’ve been a psychopath, for all they knew ( “it’s okay, we have guards” ). After we submitted his Palanca entry, where once again he thanked me for being there (I lent him my pen because apparently, one can’t exactly register for the Palanca awards if one didn’t have a pen. One should also bring extra copies, three for the judges and one original – we printed five but only brought four, including the one which was supposed to be mine but ended up being submitted to the Palanca authorities anyway.  Erwin, I’m still waiting for my copy via email ), we went to the Umma Gumma’s booth at The Fort. There I met Yvonne, his fiancée (and Umma Gumma designer), and saw some of the clothes they have been selling. Erwin is a lousy seller :) Anyway, it was also the Urban Fiesta at The Fort. I met some of Erwin’s batchmates from Southridge (David Sebastian is sooo hot), a really nice girl named Corinne and I saw Radioactive Sago Project and Bamboo, the band, perform. After we brought all the clothes back to their home, we went to Gweilo’s, the bar, where we met Mario again, and Mr. Jack Daniels (I forgot his name! They kept calling him “Mr. Jack Daniels”!). There I realized how the study of law can be very advantageous. They all thought I was pretty smart and they kept saying how weird it was for one to study law and listen to rock music at the same time. Not all law students are geeks, hello?! Most law students can drink and smoke more than all the kids at Gweilo’s could.   It was around 3:30am when Erwin said that I should be going back to my dorm already (I call it dorm while my roommates call it “condo”. It is a condo unit but it feels like a dorm) so he and driver brought me back to Manly Mansion. He was (is still) very nice to me and I can’t imagine how a guy coming from a family as rich and influential as that could be so interested about my boring, mundane, pathetic bisexual life. He is very down-to-earth and friendly (I almost got introduced to Bamboo, the vocalist. SAYANG!!!) and geeky. I’m glad he’s my friend.      N. B. Erwin writes for the YStar section of the Philippine Star and is the host of the NU 107 show “the Gweilo’s Hour” every Friday. “The Outsider” is the title of his column.  062204

      Surely you know how deeply I abhor this group of kids, particularly their only daughter. I hate her for the simple reason that she’s so darn nice and intelligent and pampered that my father keeps on comparing me to her. Kinda mean of me, I know, to blame her considering it isn’t her fault if she’s nice and intelligent and pampered. But I have a basis for all this because we never really know if they genuinely agree to make friends with me or they’re just as Tupperware as I am. I mean, I don’t resent them per se. It’s just that we have this thing called id (individual differences, silly) and what is generally normal for most people doesn’t have to be normal to others. And that is basically my point, since they’re sooo goody-two-shoes and they’re sooo brought up very well given their guidance, their access to the wonders of technology not to mention that they’re SHELTERED AND PAMPERED, there is absolutely no fucking reason why I should be compared to them, particularly to her. I mean, she’s so fuckingly perfect compared to me who’s not even close. I mean, does she do the chores, does she get out of the house, does she even get out of her own room, and was she introduced to life’s cruelty at a young age, TELL ME. She gets a general average of 98 because she hardly leaves her room (only to have her nails done), no contact with society, hello?! Why should I be compared to her? Moreso, after you so step on my feelings by embarrassing me, humiliating me and ultimately crushing my self-respect, you expect me to be chummy-chummy with her. Come on, you’ve gotta be kidding.   This girl, I pay for her fare when we see each other by chance. Never once did she mention that I’m invited to her debut (although it’s a given) and that I’m supposed to play this so-so part on it. This is the girl you’re comparing me to?   This girl, whose motives are supposed to be nice and intelligent, asks me to pre-empt my excitement by opening the gift THEY gave ME for Christmas in front of her. Why didn’t she just frigging wrap it herself? She’s intelligent, huh?   I obviously want to go to this party. I’m like, ohmigod, I’m sooo excited. Yeah right.     nuninu     When I was in high school, I’ve had the privilege of being in the star section (you know, where the smart people are) for four straight years. But that never stopped me from mingling with the “little people”: these individuals who went to parties left and right, smoked as early as they knew how to french kiss and everything else. I mean, how else would I get the reputation of being “overly-friendly” now? These people who were supposed to have brains only they didn’t want to use them (because I believe that no one is born slow), looked at us as outcasts. They treated us like we had a world of our own. Well, what can I say, they were (okay, okay, WE were) a bunch of conceited brats, but we were self-reliant. We didn’t need them. We were multi-talented: we could sing, act, dance, play instruments, lead in the field of politics and military training (you name it, we had it), not to mention, some of my classmates were darn pretty, plus we excelled in our academics. There was competition, intrigues; everything of just about everything was there. It wasn’t really our fault we get placed in classrooms away from people. No wonder these narrow-minded bigots never liked us. They could, individually, but as a whole, they hated us. And I could understand that. They never thought of us as people who had fun. We were brains. I just didn’t expect that up to now, six years later, SIX WONDERFUL YEARS LATER, they’re still thinking that way.   Some of us got pregnant out of wedlock, tried jutes, got into bands but they still look at us as if we’re not human, as if we’re not capable of being cool, in their standards. Now that I look at it, since said standards are so fuckingly low and shallow, I never want to meet it.   I mean, think that way all you want, all your life. Get shocked when one of us falters, ignore us like a disease, ostracize us. It doesn’t change the fact that we’re humans, humans that ticked you off because we reminded you of how not-smart you were.    I thank you.     N.B.&nbsp; i learned to french kiss at age 14, smoke and drink at age 15.&nbsp; i learned to be really vocal about my angst long before i could write a whole paragraph.&nbsp; it's been 10 years since i graduated from high school and until now, some of the people i referred to in this journal entry still think of us that way.&nbsp; it pisses me off because they don't get it.&nbsp; they just don't get it.

      I’m happy right now. I’ve finally made peace with one of my exs. Well, I’m slowly making peace with every living human being I’ve hurt in this lifetime (loading up on good karma before the bar exams) and tell you what, the feeling is actually exhilarating. It’s like a load has been lifted from my chest and I’ve been carrying it for so long. I actually thought she’s in connivance with my ex of three years to make my life miserable. It turns out she’s not and we’re really good friends right now and I love it. Our closeness makes the ex of three years crazy. Talk about paranoia.    Point of information:  Before my ex of three years, I went out with this lesbian but we only went out for two months because I was such a slut then and I take full responsibility for everything. But I just have to say that I don’t seduce people who don’t want to be seduced. Let me just say that :)   Anyway, people are speculating that we’re together because we are always together and she kinda lives in my ex’s house because they’re best friends (told you I was/is a slut hehehe) so people aren’t speculating in a good way. And I just so want to say: it’s not,”are they together?” It’s, “ARE THEY TOGETHER AGAIN?”     N.B. Don’t tell my ex-girlfriend’s new girlfriend I said that :)

      When I first entered law school, I didn’t have illusions of grandeur, my father did. He was the one who wanted to go to law school, I didn’t. After graduating from college I thought I’d be slave to the corporate pigs for a while and then when I’m like high up the food chain, I’d do my own gig.   It obviously didn’t happen because there was this big recession in 1998 and I went straight to law school. I stayed in this particular school for two years before being pirated by my beloved law school ( translation:    I got kicked out because they didn’t want my money, I wasn’t cute enough for their standards and I didn’t make too many friends from the higher ups  ). Anyway, still, no delusions or illusions of magnificence, I just wanted to get it over with. You know, I just modified my dreams a bit. Instead of being slave to the corporate pigs, I thought I’d be slave to the lawyer-crocs for a few years and when I finally got the hang of what I was doing, I’d start my own practice. I’d only hire the gays and lesbians and the chubby short people, because I’d probably have the same difficulty finding a job myself, being the short, chubby person that I am.   I was always having these conversations with myself and with God, in the church and I’d tell Him that it didn’t really matter to me if I didn’t have a love life, for as long as my grades were good. It didn’t matter to me if nobody ever thought I was beautiful for as long as I could answer what the mean lawyer-professor would ask me in class correctly. I even had this sign, this 20-word line, which would only be uttered by, “  The One  ”. That’s how I’d know it’s him/her. Till then, I’d be submerged in my studies.   Then I transferred. My old school was fag and dude heaven, this new law school was full of lesbian promise. There were hardly any cute single guys and the only yummy people worth paying any attention to were the lesbians, the butches. I think I’m gonna like it here, I thought. So I did.   I met this girl. She was really nice. She had a best friend who was also nice. They were both cute and hot and they were both attracted to me as I was to them. Little did I know that they have this history of fighting over the same women even before I got there.   I first went out with A. We were together for two months then she broke up with me because she had to fix her life and take care of other people and stuff. M entered the picture weeks later. They didn’t talk to each other for years because of me. Of course, the relationship with M lasted for like three years. It could probably be the longest rebound relationship on record, if you’d consider it a rebound relationship. It ended the same way the relationship ended with A. Tragic. (   Funny, the music playing in my PC right now is The Smiths’ Please Let Me Get What I Want from the Pretty in Pink OST, which also happens to be a love triangle   ) The lying, the cheating, the crying, the backstabbing, the horror of it, it’s all so telenovela.   They’re back together now, I mean, they’re friends again. Kinda makes you think they were just trying to prove a point: they’re studs and I’m a slut.   I’m tired of this Dawson-Joey-Pacey hoopla. I love them both in different degrees. In two different occasions I saw myself spending the rest of my life with either of them, but it doesn’t mean I played with them. I want to think that they didn’t set this up to play me, either. I still have faith in people, no matter how little. I just hate it that friendships have to be ruined and that I’m the one doing most of the damage. It hurts to not know who in the end will be singing “Power of Two” with me. Maybe I’m just better off alone.    It makes me kinda wonder all of a sudden:   Lord, am I only appealing to lesbians?

       a year ago today, my then girlfriend had a dental appointment. it was our month-sary. she ended up spending the whole day with the dentist and i spent the whole day with my other ex-girlfriend who was recuperating from her breakup with her girlfriend (the one who replaced me). i tried my best to amuse myself while i was trying to make my ex feel better. i tried my best not to be jealous. who wouldn't be? my then girlfriend arrived with two bottles of strawberry daiquiri. one was wrapped in a paper bag with a ribbon on it and one was placed in 7-11 plastic. guess which one was mine?        the one in the 7-11 plastic  .       the only thing that made her gift to me different from the gift  she gave to her then dentist (now girlfriend) was that   I'M HER GIRLFRIEND   so i have chocolates.  wonderful.        since then, i haven't really taken any strawberry daiquiri for my consumption, except maybe the one i drank while watching the NU107 lounge concert with my good friend Chris. that ex-girlfriend of mine stayed with her ( ohmigod, they're living together! ) because they're best friends. oh, and we're close again, that ex-girlfriend, i mean. my then girlfriend broke up with me months later; she and her dentist are a thing now. the rest, they say, is shit.

      i write the way i speak. i'm a very bitchy person and naturally, very harsh words come out of my relatively small mouth. it comes with the package.  a lot of people have told me that i write twisted-esque. twisted being the patent of great writer Jessice Zafra. while i am flattered by the comparison, i am not in any way trying to become her protegee or clone. in other words, i'm not a Jessica Zafra wannabe. i just happen to be really really angry and if there is the slightest resemblance of her style in my writing, the same is not intended. besides, i have to live with so much pressure:  my dad makes me live out his dreams for him; my mom died before i could actually "grow up" and she didn't see me achieve whatever little i have accomplished;  i am attracted to guys who don't even acknowledge my existence; i am only attractive to lesbians; i'm taking the fucking bar exams this September and i don't even know ANYTHING. Jessica Zafra, she gets to be on tv, radio, print media. she writes well, she's brilliant.  the only mean thing i think that she's had to live with is the fact her parents waited too long for her to arrive that when she was finally born, they actually thought she wasn't human (i got this info from one of her books).  other than that, what's her excuse?  i had a dream when i was younger.  i said that these people can think less of me all they want but their kids will be reading my shit  :)

       i barely get to go out and watch movies. when i do get to go out, it's just drinking with my lovable friends or my fraternity brothers and sorority sisters. i want so much to watch movies but i rarely have the time, the bar exams being barely a month from now and i'm kinda short on cash right now, actually.  anyway, this morning i got to watch   urlLink  A Walk To Remember    on cable and it was really nice. i didn't get to watch it when it was shown here before because we were so busy rehearsing with the band for one of our fundraising concerts. i got to sing Only Hope. anyway, the movie was very nice. it helped me cry and feel more sorry about myself that i am unattached. the songs featured in the soundtrack were good even if meant that listening to   urlLink  Mandy Moore    would give me gas.  the song is kinda memorable to me because three different people were involved with me at the time and they all thought that the song was for them. (i am such a slut!!!) i somehow thought that i'd end up with one of them although at the time i couldn't really figure out which one.  the movie talked about Jamie Sullivan's wish list (  there's actually a book.  see?  told you some of the best movies come from books, otherwise, they wouldn't bother making movies out of them.  which reminds me, i have to come up with me own birthday wish list hmmn . . .  ), the first being to get married in the church where her mother got married.  unlike Jamie, and majority of the female population, i didn't have kiddie dreams of getting married, of picking out wedding gowns, flowers although i get flashes when i attend other people's weddings.  but the movie really made me cry.  maybe because i'm still bitter (  you tell people you're not bitter, they'll still think you are.  you admit to being bitter and they think it's their obligation to pity you.  sometimes, people, i think, should just get a life.  theirs are so mundane that they need yours to put spice to their sorid existence  ), or maybe because, i don't have a mom anymore, maybe because i don't have that good a relationship with my dad, or maybe because SHANE WEST IS SOOO HOT and he's kissing Mandy Moore  NOT ME .
