      Well I just wanted to take a moment to bitch and complain as most American's have been over the past few weeks as to rising cost of Gasoline.  Ahhh, I really don't know where to start, First of all if I hear one more gas station attendant telling me "Be glad you car doesn't run on milk" i am going to pull my hair out. You don't have to make up excuses for the gas prices, you just work there.    I guess what pisses me off the most, other than paying $2.00 a gallon for this crap is hearing these mentally challenged tree hugging warm and fuzzy butt munchers explain, "This is just want the SUV drivers need, they need to be punished for driving Gas hogs!".  I am sorry, this is America, a free fucking country for which I have the write to say anything that I want to. If I want to drive a full on 18-wheeler to work everyday, that's my business. Just because I choose to drive a truck (not a semi, just a Ford) doesn't mean that I need to pay more for my gas than someone who drives a rice-burner.  I use my truck for things other than hauling my ass around, I haul furniture, gravel, etc..with it. And it's used to haul things on a weekly basis.    I know that since I drive a larger vehicle I do use more gas to do the trips that I make but I also pay more to fill my tank up than people with smaller cars. However, it does not justify charging people with less economical vehicles more than would a smaller car.    I just wish that these people would shut-up and quit polluting the air!!!!!!

      This Blog is in response to an article on today's Yahoo! News page. The article titled "Web Amplifies Message of Primitive Executions" came from the LA Times which doesn't suprise me in the least.  To briefly paraphrase the article it was about the recent beheading's of the prisoners in Iraq and the video clips that are available on the internet for anyone to view.  This psychologist believes that it's horrible to allow people to watch this barbaric act.  Then another person, an FBI specialist thinks it's a new form of cyber terrorism that must be stopped.  What is wrong with these people?  Do they think that they should censor us from everything? In my personal opinion, I think it's good for Americans to see the video's. I honestly believe that if you think reasoning is a function that these people can comprehend is unthinkable.  Watch the videos of Nick Berg being beheaded and listen to the sound of his screams being silenced by the sound of him gurgling to death on his own blood. This gives you a new perspective of who we are dealing with. It's bullcrap when we censor the violence shown against our own people.  That is why there are so many liberal fools running around screaming that we are hurting innocent non-harming people.  I ask that everyone would look these videos up and watch them, or at least look at the pictures.  It's not that you are supporting those monsters, it is just that you should have a clear perspective of the value of our freedom.  Seeing the pictures of Paul Johnson with his severed head laying on his back was gruesome, then seeing the way they placed the knife blade on his head was even worse.    These people didn't use a sword or sharp knife to cut their heads off with either.  They used smaller knives, probably 6 to 8 inches in length.  Chopping and hacking into these people....Nick Berg's head was chopped/sawed at least a dozen times before it was removed.    I ask that you watch the video or view the pictures as a way to show the quality of people that we are fighting against.  It will also prove to many people the lack of ability to reason with these monsters.  It also makes the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal look like a joke....what we did to those people was a smack on the hand. I say we start chopping heads off ourself, starting with Sadaam's!

      Ok, I have heard just about enough of this "Poor" Michael Moore their picking on me crap.  Michael Moore has just about as much business making a documentary on National events/Figures as he does being a spokesperson for "weight watchers".    This guy is ultra-lib and would just assume that America would crumble to ruins than to have to go through War.  I have often wondered by Mr. Moore didn't emphasize Bill Clinton's role in letting this country get invaded and terrorized.  Apparently, Mr. Moore feels that he is being censored because theaters in this country do not want to show his craptacular piece of theatrics.  He feels that the "Right Wing Conspiracy" is out to get him. Oh Michael, "Do you want to run and find your mommie?".  I cannot believe that Liberals, especially those completely off the pie charts, believe that there is a Right Wing Conspiracy.  Good Lord man, get a grip.  Look at all of the major news medias, NBC, CBS, CNN, ABC, etc, they are all LIBERAL.  Hell Katie Couric has practically had an orgasm every morning this week because of Clinton's interviews.  They drill and grill each and every known Conservative on the air, while trying to give the impression that they are "Fair and Just".  They claim that they are showing both sides, but look at Andy Rooney.  Believe me this old fart is an entirely different ballgame and can fill up a Blog on his own, but this guy is so Liberal.  He is such a remarkable jackass, completely lost in his pompus attitude and better than though attitude.  CBS is this the best that you have to put on the air because I would rather have every hair on my body plucked out with tweezers.  I can't wait till he buys the farm......   This is a quote from Mr. Moore (giving him the dignity of calling him Mr.):  "The right wing usually wins these battles. Their basic belief system is built on censorship, repression, and keeping people ignorant. They want to limit or snuff out any debate or dissension. They also don't like pets and are mean to small children. Too many of them are named "Fred."  "    That was from his website this morning.....actually Mr. Moore looks like he likes pets a little too much and should be named Fred. The Right censors, The Right keeps people ignorant.  Well apparently, if that is the case, then THE RIGHT WON WITH YOU MR. MOORE because you are undoubtedly the most ignorant person that I have ever seen.    He also manages to state that " This new nut group is the Right's last hope in limiting how many people can see this movie."  . Ok, Mr. Moore this is a free country because our men and women who believe in freedom and liberty fought and died for pathetic people like you.  You who want to tuck your tail and not fight for our liberties or the liberties of others.  I have yet to see or hear of anyone who has been withheld from watching whatever movie, television show, etc that they wish to view.  It's a free country, not because of people like you. Maybe people just don't want to see your sucky movie and you just can't admit it.  I think that people should have the right to see your piece of crap, but while they are in there I want them to realize that they just padded the pocket of a person who would rather screw over his country than stand up for it.    I am most disappointed by the amount of women who follow this crap and believe it for fact.  Most of all the person interviewed after viewing the movie stating, "I am very ashamed to be an American."  GIVE ME A BREAK, a few words for you, "YOU DON'T LIKE IT, LEAVE IT."  It's just that simple, if you are ashamed to be an American, I don't see you leaving this country and moving to Afghanistan.  Mr. Moore, maybe you should rethink your future movies, and decide to take them out of the toilet before you air them out.

      Ok, I can take a lot of crap, but I guess working with a liberal has to take the cake.    This man, let us call him Space Cadet, as not to offend his paranoid Schizophrenic marijuana induced state by revealing his true identity.  So let's start....  The day begins, he comes to work, mumbling and cussing to himself. He sits in his cubicle and continues to ramble for 30 minutes amongst himself, going so far as asking questions and answering himself.  When he stops, he proceeds to spend the rest of the morning surfing e-Bay shopping for parts for his 9 cars that he owns.  YES, supposedly the Democrats are working class people...however, this guy owns 9 cars.  He then continues to work crossword puzzles and takes a nap in his cubicle while everyone else is working.  He does manage to do something constructive (using constructive loosely of course!)usually during the day, he will usually write a Letter to the Editor of the local newspaper, chastizing the President for spending money to Iraq and getting nothing in return, or demanding answers from the local congressman because they are asking for tax increases and he wants to know where the money is going. It's funny to me that he is concerned over how other people are spending their money but not how his employee is spending money to pay him for doing absolutely nothing.    He rants and raves the latter part of the day about how Bush is horrible and we need a Liberal in office.  Space Cadet claims that marijuana should be legalized because "It never hurt anybody." Yet from personal experience, I have seen numerous friends and family waste their lives living in oblivion and seeing that "never hurt anybody pot habit" turn into a serious drug addiction.  Space Cadet also claims that abortion never hurt anybody either. That a baby isn't alive until it's born, however, when I ask him for proof he just spins it around until I stop asking.    He believes that the Government should support him and his family when he gets older, but he thinks that he shouldn't have to be responsible for anything that he does.  His ideas are always right, you are always wrong.  His canidate for office is always a champion and yours is always a fluke.  Space Cadet believes that you shouldn't own a gun, you don't have any reason to own one. He thinks that everyone runs around with the warm fuzzies all the time and that life would be perfect if we stopped manufacturing guns.  He believes that we should continue to leave the borders open on this country and not have a Department of Homeland Security. Because, "really, what do we need these people for, they aren't hurting anyone".  Quoted from the mouth of the oh so intelligent Space Cadet.  Well no, these people don't hurt anyone do they, they just blew up thousands of people in a building and hijacked planes full of innocent people and killed them.  No, they don't "HURT" anybody do they.  Space Cadet believes that we shouldn't be fighting this war. He believes that we all should just hold hands and sing "Kumbaya" and everything will be just peachy. He believes that the militaries budget should be cut along with defense spending.  Here in the real world, away from his drug induced, brain washed stupor, he needs to realize that SHIT DOES HAPPEN. How does he think that his children and himself got the freedom that we have in this country, it's not because of the likes of Katie Couric, Bill Clinton or himself.  It's because we took a fucking stand, we took care of business, faced the enemy and took charge.    If you have the problem of being a liberal, stop and think for a minute...... What if you had been aborted? What if we didn't have a military? What if drugs were made legal? What if nobody did their job and worked? What if your husband/wife died on September 11th? What if your life depended upon owning a gun? What if we all just sat back and watched the grass grow? What if you lived under tyranny and fear?  Changes the way you think, I hope.......

      It is completely horrible to see the recent news about the latest three INNOCENT people who were decapitated by those savages claiming that they are "holy warriors" when in fact they are nothing more than a wild beast in the most politically correct word available.  These freaks, yes freaks, are on their religious parade to drag Americans and their Allies into the ground.  How could these people justify their hate? Especially when America is dumping money and resources into that country who deserves nothing more than Camel dung.  Billions and Billions of dollars, our people rebuilding their cities and homes, liberating women so that they may attend schools, ending the oppression of a crazy regime who feasted on the terror of others.  WHY do these people continue to fight against their own liberation?  Do they not understand that the jealousy that they have towards this country because of our Freedom is being given to them on a silver platter at the American taxpayer's expense.  We pay for them to have a better life, we are paying for them to have their freedom and opportunities.  However, they repay us by killing soldiers who are rebuilding and restoring their communities. By killing innocent contractors, engineers, and business men/women who come there to establish their economy.  Not just killing them but enduring them to the most horrible form of death that I can imagine, slowly sawing their head off.  In my opinion, we should be taking these prisoners that we are also paying for and supporting and start chopping heads off.  I believe that their is not reasoning with evil, and these people are in the purest form nothing but shear evil.  We should line these people up and behead them, with small knives, sawing on them like they did Mr. Berg. His video depicted the horrific incident full on, showing him "hacked" on multiple times while screaming to the top of his lungs.   We should film these massive beheadings and show them to their people.  Let them find the humor and honor in watching their  maniac breed being obliterated in front of them.  I have since changed my mind on the prisoner abuse scandal rocking the airwaves- I say line them up and feed the scum to the dogs. I know that's heartless, but sometimes you just can't be reasonable, sometimes you have to do the unimaginable and that's exactly what we need to do.

      Well this country never ceases to amaze me in the least.  Day after day we see the news media slam the fundamentals that this country was based upon...and for what? FOR RATINGS.    The Iraqi prisoner scandal which completely befuddles me as to why we let this situation dominate our airways when those savages are over there beheading innocent, YES INNOCENT, civilians.  The American News media has blood on their hands because their coverage (actually not just coverage extensive overblown coverage) of the abuse scandal is what motivated these actions.    I am not in any way condoning what the soldiers did to those men, but come on people, we are dealing with a bunch maniacs over there. These people do not see us as a hero, liberating them, they see us as nothing more than a threat to their existence and want us to be completely obliterated. It amuses me to hear people say, "Oh we should have just met with these people and compromised with them."  I am sorry but you cannot compromise or negotiate with animals. And in their purest and most honest form they are nothing more than civilized savages.  You can tell that from simply seeing the pictures of Mr. Berg who was beheaded or better yet watching the video which gives you a whole new perspective on cruelty! Or seeing the most recent pictures of Paul Johnson with his bloody head laying on the side of his body with a knife blade laying across his face.    People it doesn't get any more real than that, this is what we are dealing with in this country. Not innocent women and children-but pure blooded murdering fiends.  This doesn't go for everyone in that country but for the most part they are just fiends.

      This comes from an article titled  "Say What? Iowa first lady slammed blacks, Easterners and Southerners as bad speakers".&nbsp;  The article was posted on July 26, 2004 on the Boston Herald's website ( urlLink www.BostonHerald.com ).&nbsp; The article was written by David R. Guarino and will have some excerpts used for this blog.  To set the story, Iowa's first lady is Christie Vilsak, made some rather rude and very pompus accusations against blacks, southerners and easterners.&nbsp; Her reasoning is "because I can't understand them."  From the article:&nbsp;&nbsp; ``I am fascinated at the way some African-Americans speak to each other in an English I struggle to understand, then switch to standard English when the situation requires,'' Vilsack wrote in a 1994 column in the Mount Pleasant News, while her husband, Tom, was a state senator.    What in the world was this woman thinking? Last time that I checked this was a free country and we were able to speak in whatever language that we choose.&nbsp; Yes, I may speak different in a business situation rather than when I am at home but it's not because I am ignorant.&nbsp; Maybe these people didn't want her to understand what they were saying to begin with.&nbsp; Sorry that you are apparently a white-bred honky (yes, the word honky was created for you my dear lady).  Another 2 comments from the article:  "Vilsack wrote that southerners seem to have ``slurred speech,'' wrote that she'd rather learn Polish than try to speak like people from New Jersey, and wrote that a West Virginian waitress once offered her friend a ``side saddle'' instead of a ``side salad.''     &nbsp;"Vilsack's Aug. 24, 1994, column was particularly critical of dialects from other regions of the country. In addition to the knock on African-Americans, Vilsack knocked residents of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``Later, on the boardwalk, I heard mothers calling to their children, `I'll meet yoose here after the movie,' '' she wrote. ``The only way I can speak like residents of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania is to let my jaw drop an inch and talk with my lips in an `O' like a fish. I'd rather learn to speak Polish.''    Does this lady have a conflict with the Polish people as well, she's so hell bent on learning to speak Polish rather than asking for them to repeat what they were saying. Maybe if Mrs. Vilsack cleaned the Liberal Weannie Juice from her ears then she would be able to understand everyone clearly.  I am so glad that Mr. Guarino published this informative information about Kerry's supporters. I believe that if I was John Kerry I would have a brief and enlightening conversation with Mrs. Vilsack informing her that she should get a hearing aid and keep her mouth shut.&nbsp; This lady is a teacher which is what bothers me even more, this is the type of crap that we are letting teach our children.&nbsp; No wonder the country is going to hell in a handbasket.&nbsp; I know that it is important to speak and write grammatically correct; however, again it is a free country and people can speak in whatever language they choose.  Last comment from the article: " Two years later, in a column about her trip to the Olympics in Atlanta, Vilsack said she had ``language problems.''&nbsp;&nbsp;`When I ask for directions, I can't understand the slurred speech of southern Americans, who are so polite and eager to please,'' Vilsack said. "   On a closing note, Mrs. Vilsack, you are lucky that Southern Americans gave you a minute of the precious time to give you directions. I am sure being the person that you are, you would not offer to help anyone in need. You would roll up the window in your BMW and blow dust in their faces.&nbsp; Mrs. Vilsack the next time that you pass through one of our fine Southern States, remember to keep cruising through at a very high speed. Cause we're a&nbsp;needin someone to use fer target practice, seein that we're uneducated and all.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Ah yet another wonderful beacon of hope coming from the democratic party and their supporters (add sarcasm as necessary!).  The Vote for Change Tour announced on MoveOn.org.  Highlighting such acts (let me stress ACTS) as R.E.M. with their flaming front man Michael Stipes (uh oh, I was just labeled homophobic), John Mellencamp (who cares anymore, he's been forgotten), Pearl Jam (Oh now there's a bunch of role models for our children!), Jackson Browne (Free Pot for everybody), and of course the Dixie Chicks (Communist broads who wouldn't know Dixie if it bit them in the ASS).   There were some disappointments when I read the list, Bonnie Raitt, come on now. I love to hear the woman sing but now seeing that she's supporting the left wing loonies I have to wonder about her. And John Fogerty, well he's older than mud but I still liked his music.  I guess my point is why do these celebrities feel that it is necessary to  to flex their so-called superstardom to attract votes for the liberal weanies.  I am sorry but they need to mind their own business, they are actors, singers, and comedians. NOT POLITICIANS.  And i am sure that some poor helpless idiot out there who cannot make a decision for themselves who will see these buffoons and claim, Oh I am gonna vote for the Pearl Jam canidate.  Not only that but what qualifies these celebrities to pursue political aspirations.  Give me a frigin' break people.  I work in enforcement, therefore I enforce.  I don't get our here and play a concert for President Bush claiming that we need HOPE and we need CHANGE.  It's a crock of crap, especially when you are supporting a canidate like Kerry who can't flip fast enough to catch his flops.   Musicians should sing, Actors should act, and should just shut the hell up about politics.  Your brilliance isn't that stupendous.
