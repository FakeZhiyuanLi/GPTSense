       i am truly and completely bored and i think that we should not have to go to school tomorrow.  I think that we should all be rebels and ditch tomorrow.  Even though that would probably mean grade suicide b/c we would all be missing our finals/tests tom. But then again if everyone didnt go then they could give us ALL bad grades. yeah that would be pretty cool...So anyways today was really bad cuz i didnt study for my finals really and i sorta didnt understand any of the stuff on the tests...especially bio...why do they teach us this hanus stuff...i mean who is ever going to use biology when they get older...unless u r someone unusually smart who is like a genius and ur going to dicover something like a cure for cancer or something.

      A water bearer in China had 2 large pots, each hung on the ends of a pole which he carried across his neck.  One of the pots had a crack in it, while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water. At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only 1/2 full.  For a full 2 years this went on daily, with the bearer delivering only 1 1/2 pots full of water to his house. Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments, perfect for which it was made.  But the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was able to accomplish only 1/2 of what it had been made to do. After 2 years of what had seemed to be a complete and bitter failure, the pot spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream.  "i am ashamed of myself, b/c this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house." The bearer said to the pot, "Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path but not on the other pot's side? That's b/c I have always known about your flaw, and i planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back, you've watered them.  For 2 years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate this table.  Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house."  Moral: Each of us have our own unique flaws.  We're all cracked pots.  But its the cracks and flaws we each have that make our lives together so very interesting and rewarding.  You've just got to take each person for what they are and look for the good in them...  * I really liked this story and i just wanted to share it with you all and also i thought it would make a good beginning to this site.
