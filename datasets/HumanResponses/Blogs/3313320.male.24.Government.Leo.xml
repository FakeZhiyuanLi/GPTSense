      As you can see above, today I was  Getting a few last-minute items taken care over  before I make my way to Tokyo on the 31st of this month. Until now I have been looking at this large pile of clothing and putting off packing it up until the eleventh hour. Now it's crunch-time and I have to have it all taken care of before the 30th. I know I really shouldn't be procrastinating so much. However, there have been so many people I have to say good-bye to before I leave, that packing has lowered itself on my list of things to do. Ohh well, I guess I'll just have to let you know in Tokyo. See Ya There!

       Hello Everyone,    &nbsp;  This will be the point of information and activity about my life as an American in Japan. I hope that my family and friends will get the opportunity to view and post messages on this site. Initially, I was hoping to get a Flash Website up and running before I made my way to Japan. However, since I haven't really ever used the software, publishing a site while trying to learn Flash proved more difficult than I had hoped. So, here we are at  urlLink http://tyler-mitchell.blogspot.com/ . I hope you enjoy reading and posting as much as I.

      Hello Everybody,  I have finally made it. I have arrived in Japan. As of August 1st I, Tyler Mitchell, am a Kokusai Koryuin or Coordinator for International Relations in  urlLink Aomori prefecture , the northern most prefecture in mainland Japan. If you look at the map my town,  urlLink Ajigasawa  falls just to the west Kizukuri City. The local specialties include Ika (squid) and Suika (Watermelon). Honestly, I am just finding out about the town myself, but could not be happier with my placement. There are two other JETs who are my co-workers. Paul and myself are the two new guys. He is from Canada and Tricia who is the third year Assistant Language Teacher. She is our big sis and couldn't be more helpful. Finally, my supervisor Oku who has spent the last few days helping Paul and I get situated in our new life in Ajigasawa. I really wish I could say more but now we are off to Aomori City for Nebuta Matsuri(festival) to participate in the parade with the rest of the Aomori JETs. I don't know what exactly to expect but I'm sure it will be quite interesting. I promise to post some more pictures for everybody, it just I still need to get my hands on a digital camera. Heba (See Ya Later)
