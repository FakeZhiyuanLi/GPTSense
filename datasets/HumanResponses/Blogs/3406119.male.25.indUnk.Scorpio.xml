       Letter From a Concerned Follower (Pedro the Lion on his EP "The Only Reason I Feel Secure is that I'm Validated By My Peers")   it's weird to think of all the things that have not been keeping up with the times it's ten o'clock the sun has now just begun to set the western hills on fire  i hear that you don't change how do you expect to keep up with the trends you won't survive the information age unless you plan to change the truth to accommodate the brillance of men the brillance of men  some folks think we're better now social evolution's new synthetic will will keep us on the straighter path as better men use brand new math with no wrong answers  i'm just a little bit worried do you have some sort of plan have you been finally defeated by the cunning of these fully evolved men   Psalm 40:4-5 (translated by Eugene Peterson in "The Message")   Blessed are you who give yourselves over to God, turn your backs on the world's "sure thing," ignore what the world worships; The world's a huge stockpile of GOD-wonders and God-thoughts. Nothing and no one comes close to you! I start talking about you, telling what I know, and quickly run out of words. Neither numbers nor words account for you.

      In 2002 I was having a crisis of faith of sorts.  That summer represented the end of my one-year internship working with Campus Crusade for Christ.  Prior to that job I had been involved with the organization as an undergraduate.  In many ways, the organization had been quite instrumental in my spiritual growth.  They had provided me with fellowship—friends who loved Jesus, something that seemed rare at a large university like UW-Madison.  They imparted to me a desire to study the Bible, and motivated me to share the good news with others.  Despite these blessings they had also led me into a faith that was mostly rooted in a rational, calculated, non-relational, overly simplistic modern worldview.  It was that summer, in Alaska, that this modern worldview was finally exposed.  Leading up to that summer I had been experiencing what I thought was a dark night of the soul, and perhaps it was.  Since I had been first introduced to Crusade I had always had my doubts, but that year I found that the “answers” I had been taught were simply unhelpful tips from the evangelical party-line.  I found myself in the midst of reading through the four spiritual laws with students and trying just as hard to convince myself that the gospel was true.  In February the temperatures dropped well below zero and an impersonal darkness crept into town.  I found it nearly impossible to pray, and my roommate, Tony, said that I was waking him at ungodly hours with the cries of my “night terrors”.  Three months later, in the first week of June, I found myself on a plane headed for my summer staff assignment in Anchorage.  For the duration of the six and a half hour flight I feared that if the staff team found out about my spiritual state I would be on the same flight the next day headed in the opposite direction.  A week later I found myself living in Alaska with five undergraduate students who were looking to me for spiritual direction.  For five weeks I was a Jacob wrestling with my God.  I was surrounded by His creation, but I was not sure who He had created me to be or who He was.  I sensed I was on the cusp of a spiritual breakthrough.  There were two possibilities: either I was discarding a fake plastic God for a living Creator or I was close to agnosticism.  One way or the other, I knew I was close to a significant spiritual change.  The night before I was to return to Minneapolis my co-worker, Matt Koschmann, invited me to climb the highest peak in Anchorage.  With only hours left in the land of the midnight sun and uncertainty concerning when I might next return, it was an invitation that I could not resist.  The two of us arrived at the trailhead of Mt. O’Malley one hour past midnight, just as the sun entered its three hour Alaskan siesta—its afterglow illuminating our path as brightly as a neighbourhood streetlamp.  The journey was three hours up and just over two hours down, and my plane was departing for home in less than eight hours.  We had to climb quickly.  As we inched toward our goal—the highest overlook in the city—we huffed out conversation between large gasps of thick air.  Much of our ascending dialogue centered on my spiritual doubts and fears.  Matt was a friend that I trusted, and there was little that I left unsaid.  He listened compassionately, offering me encouragement in the form of Snickers bars along the way.  As we neared O’Malley’s peak our verbal communication became a silent co-pilgrimage—two friends on a shared journey.  At the peak we stood in silent awe as the sun awoke from its short nap.  As the light in the sky began to reveal the life in the valley my existential angst became humble admiration.  God had created all this unexplainable beauty!  He was God, and I was not.  Upon our descent I could think of nothing but placing my next step on stable ground.  I had just experienced a major moment in my spiritual journey, but it had gone mostly unnoticed.  The descent was nothing more than a race to the airport.  Nine months later I found myself at my journal.  As I began to write about this experience I had in mind that I would write about what had been nothing more than an ordinary hike—an adventurous risk we take in our youth.  But as I wrote, the unseen meaning of that evening began to appear.  I quickly realized that it had been much more than a hike.  That morning God had shown me that He is not a god of zeros and ones.  He is not a being that I can dissect and examine with rational logic.  He is the living God, a friend whose love is knowable, but whose being is incomprehensible.  He is the creator and redeemer.  He is a lamp unto my feet.

      This past fall semester a great deal of my time was consumed with researching and writing about Catholic Worker founder and all around radical woman, Dorothy Day.  Eventually, I started telling my housemates that if they needed me I would be out on another date with Dorothy; Zach started referring to me as the resident "Dorothyologian".  One of the most inspiring aspects of this woman's life was the way that she lived out a theology of personalism.  She really understood Christianity to be about seeing Christ in the other.    Dorothy Day, self-admittedly, was not a theologian. However, her theology--a patchwork of numerous influences with love at its core--had a profound impact on her spirituality and praxis.  Her biggest influence was her friendship with Peter Maurin.  Immediately after their introduction, he began indoctrinating Day with his social vision.  According to Day, this "consisted of Maurin coming over to her apartment and expounding to her on God, the church, the Church Fathers, the saints, the poor, hospitality, liberalism, capitalism, fascism, communism, personalism, distributism, anarchism, Aquinas, Catherine of Siena, Chesterton, Belloc, Maritain, Berdyaev, Kropotkin, and so on, until she had heard enough for one day and sent him away."   He believed that the main problem with society was that sociology, economics, and politics had all been separated from the Gospel.   Society had become ordered around production and consumption, rather than the full development of persons.   According to Maurin, the church had the answer to this; there was "dynamite in the Gospels", but Christians were not willing to "blow the lid" off that dynamite.   What was needed was an interpretation of Scripture that took Jesus councils of perfection from the Sermon on the Mount seriously.  This simple interpretation, a theology of personalism, was the cornerstone of Maurin's social vision.  Christian personalism, as Maurin taught it, was a revolution which called for "building a new world within the shell of the old."   It was a "revolution of the heart" that began with the love of Christ that is within each person.  The theology of personalism puts a particular emphasis on the Imago Dei--that all humans are created in the image of God.  Therefore, human life is sacred and not to be harmed or killed.  Each person bears a personal moral responsibility for him/herself and others.     Maurin's personalism had several theological and philosophical roots.  Primarily, he looked to the 20th century Russian philosopher, Nicholas Berdyaev, whose writings-- The Meaning of History  and  The End of Our Time --were a personalist voice against the bourgeois-spirit.  For Berdyaev, history had nothing to do with "progress", power, comfort, or material success.  Instead, the center of history is the Incarnation.  Christ stands at the center and the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is meant to participate with God in the building of the New Creation.   Maurin also found this understanding of the Incarnation in the writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas and Tolstoy's  The Kingdom of God is within You .  Maurin developed his theology of personalism more fully by turning to Emmanuel Mounier's  Personalist Manifesto .  This book, one of Maurin's favorites, emphasized personal responsibility in history and had an early understanding and harsh critique of the 20th century's consumerist mentality.   Finally, Maurin's personalism was influenced by the ideas of Jacques and Raissa Maritain's notion of a "revolution of the heart".    It was this "revolution of the heart" concept that truly inspired me last fall and winter.  I realized that I could have a part in ushering the New Kingdom in simply, but profoundly, by seeing Christ in the other (i.e. treating people I encounter like human beings).  Six months later (this month) I found myself relating to strangers in much the same way that I always had--with a sense of mild curiosity and a dose of indifference.  There were still people like the guy that has been serving me at the pizza shop for the past two years that I still didn't even know by name (cf. my previous blog about the third commandment and the significance of recognizing someone's name)!  Enter Linus, one of the most earthy, honest, and fun personalities I have ever had the blessing of befriending.  I doubt that Linus has studied up much on Mountier's theology of personalism and the way that Day put it into practice; however, for the month of June Linus took my life--and most of Vancouver--by storm.  We did most everything together, and he made new friends almost every place we visited--coffee houses, restaurants, and the neighbourhood park.  Yes, some of this is a matter of personality; but it is also much more than that.  Linus knows how to make a person feel valued.  He was quick to introduce himself, and within seconds he knew the person's name and something fairly significant about them.  As I watched the way he loved the people that have been my neighbours for the last two years I realised that I had not applied my theology of personalism.  In the most simple sense, I did not have practical personalism.  And damn it!  What's the point of studying all this good stuff if I'm not going to live it out?  Isn't that why I'm here?  I really appreciated something one of my professor's said in class today:   "Simplicity is not necessarily simplistic."    It is true that personalism is a profound theological concept, but personalism in action is quite simple.  So what did I do after this ephiphany?  I decided to be intentional in the way I interact with the strangers in my life.  I prayed that God would help me to care about the pizza/coffee guy's story.  Today I shook hands with and exchanged names with the pizza guy and the coffee guy.  As I walked out of the stores with a "Good bye, Chris" and a "See you next time, Sheresh" it is not insignificant that they both had smiles on their faces.  For some, this small act may not seem like "the dynamite of the gospel"; but for me, it is all the miracle I need for today.

      So I'm on this "what does it mean to be human?" kick these days.  I have become fascinated with the mystery and messiness of our humanness.  To sit in a coffee shop and observe the behavior of my fellow humankind has become a favourite past-time of mine.  Imagine my wonder when these specialty coffee-lovers, grasping their glasses of caffeinated-goodness, sit down next to me and begin sharing parts of their story with me.  Encounters with the wonderful souls of Vancouver are a lesson of sorts to me.  They are reminders that I live in a world full of mystery and story, and that the persons surrounding me--like the living God--are to a certain extent surrounded by a "cloud of unknowing".  I am in the middle of a course entitled "Ethics of the Decalogue" and I appreciate the way our professor frames the Ten Commandments.  He says that the separation between the first four, as laws concerning our relationship with God, and the last six, as laws concerning our relationship with our neighbour is unhelpful.  He suggests that all Ten Commandments have a vertical and a horizontal dimension.  I especially value how this view of the Decalogue informs my understanding of the first three commandments as they pertain to the manner in which I relate to my neighbour--the mysterious "other".  Thou Shall Have No Other Gods Before Me: We are to engage persons with a posture of uniqueness and exclusivity.  Like Mother Teresa, we should be able to find Christ in each person and their story.  As we engage them in conversation, they should be able to perceive that they have our exclusive attention.  We are not looking over their shoulder to see who else we should be talking to or nodding our head while thinking about "more important" things.  Throughout the day we must approach each person that intersects our path with awe and genuine interest.  Thou Shall Not Make Any Graven Images: This commandment rebukes my tendency to conform persons to my personal concept of who they are.  As holds true in my relationship with God, the instant I engage a person as if I know them completely or "have them all figured out" is the moment that I have lost respect for the mystery of being and becoming fully human.  I appreciate the way that this notion is teased out in the film  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  At one point, Clementine warns Joel that  too many guys view her as a concept--the fulfillment of all their desires and solution to their pain.  She frustratingly vents: "I am not a concept, Joel.  I am a human being.  A woman...who makes lots of mistakes and has many annoying character traits."  Well that's not verbatim, but it's close enough.  You understand what I'm getting at.  Thou Shall Not Misuse the Name of the Lord Your God: the first way we show respect for someone is by using their name correctly. And, oh, how the inclusion of a person's name at the end of a statement communicates care and intimacy, [insert your name here].  These first three commandments are the first ways in which we love someone: first, we communicate to them that as we are spending time with them that they are the only one who matters, that they are a person of worth.  Second, we give them space to be a LIVE mysterious person, rather than our own conceptualized image of who they are.  Third, we call them by name and use that name with respect.  I trust you understand why I value these reflections so much.  In many ways they've only added depth to much of what I learned in my counseling courses this past year.  Perhaps they will inspire you to stand in awe and respect of what it means to be human

      Henri Nouwen has a way of getting under my skin.  I recently read his "The Genesee Diary" which simply contains the private thoughts he recorded in his journal during a seven month stay at a Trappist monastery in upstate New York.  The book is unique in that he did not originally intend to publish these reflective entries and the result is a candid peek into Nouwen's personal struggles and desire to love God.  For the past couple of days I have been reflecting on the following citation:     My fears and my resulting fatigue over the last three years might well be diagnosed as a lack of single-mindedness, as a lack of one-eyedness, as a lack of simplicity.  Indeed, how divided my heart has been and still is!  I want to love God, but also to make a career.  I want to be a good Christian, but also have my successes as a teacher, preacher, or speaker.  I want to be a saint, but also enjoy the sensations of the sinner.  I want to be close to Christ but also popular and liked by many people.  No wonder that living becomes a tiring enterprise.  The characteristic of a saint is, to borrow Kierkegarrd's words, "To will one thing."  Well, I will more than one thing, am double-hearted, double-minded, and have a very divided loyalty.    Upon reflection, I have been overwhelmed with horror as I've realized that the one thing I continually will is personal gratification.  As much as I critique other people's posture of individualism, I am no better, if not worse in my own self-centeredness.  What is worse, the way that this flaw reveals itself is in the way I relate to others.  I look to others to shape my identity.  I want friends, family, and professors to affirm me.  I want the human beings in my life to love me with the type of love that only God is able to provide.  In response to this reflection I have been attempting to spend time in solitude.  Not necessarily meditating per se; but taking moments of quite to simply acknowledge my own inadequacies and sin and praise God for his unlimited grace and unconditional love.  I know that I am a child of God.  But I want to transfer this intellectual knowledge into my heart so that I can minimize the way in which I depend on and manipulate others to define me.  After a few days of "self-talk" and trying to bask in the presence of God I must admit that I find this discipline challenging.  After only a few moments I become distracted by the people that crowd my thoughts.  I become lonely; frustrated that I don't have someone to exchange thoughts with.  Perhaps this indicates that when it comes to communicating with the Triune God there are far too few words.  My desire is that I would learn to pray without depending on words.  I want to be still and know that God is God and I am not!  By human-effort alone, this journey into prayer is impossible.  I desire that God would gift me with the spiritual sensitivity to recognize His prompting--that He would increase my experience of His presence.

      In a conversation Sunday evening, Barry and I got talking about our desire to live WITH the poor.  We both voiced some frustration with the difficulty of applying our so-called theology.  I came across this passage from one of my favorite Regent professors, Charles Ringma, and I thought it complimented our conversation nicely:     The majority of those of us who live in the First World are relatively well off.  Yet there is a spiritual poverty in the First World.  Whether this is directly related to our materialism is an open question.  It may also be related to the way our whole life is ordered, made secure, and made predictable (cf. my previous blog).  More deeply, it may be linked to the gap we have created between what we believe and the way we live.  Having turned a deaf ear to the cry of the poor in our own world and having abandoned a discipleship that calls us away from our own concerns, we may well have lost touch with the God who champions the cause of the poor.  Therefore it is we, rather than the people of the developing world, who need to recover the vision splendid.  Nouwen makes a similar observation: "I discovered that the victims of poverty and oppression were often more deeply convinced of God's love than we are."  Possibly one way forward for those of us in the First World who long to rediscover a vibrant and relevant spirituality is to join with the poor, not as helpers, but as partners.  In this way we may also draw close to the heart of God.   Ringma leaves us with James 2.5:   Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?    These words resonate deeply within my soul.  My friend Joyce, the woman who oversees Jacob's Well (the incarnational ministry that I've told both of you about), puts it another way: like Jesus, we are not to be friends TO the poor; rather, we are to be friends OF the poor.  Initially, this thought is humbling to me--to realize that the poor have just as much or maybe more to offer me than I do them.  But the more I reflect on this concept, the more my pride and arrogance is whittled away and I begin to recognize that I don't really have that much to offer them.  This is, perhaps, why white upper-middle-class suburban kids like us are so scared to befriend the poor: we are worried that they can see right through us.  Perhaps this scares us because we are quite content with our false views of self and identity.  Reflecting on this theme encourages me to move away from my illusions concerning self and move toward vulnerability and community.  This movement that I speak of is not foreign to the three of us.  In fact, all three of us have accompanied one another on this journey.  I have the two of you to thank for most of my growth over the last three years.  You have allowed me to take off the masks that I often wore and provided me with a place where I feel known.  Thank you for that, and I pray that we will continue to bless one another in this way for our lifetimes.  For your reading pleasure, I leave you with the link to the Jacob's Well website.

      The title of this blog is the message that a fellow Regent student printed on hundreds of bumper-stickers with a university friend when he was at Calvin College just after September 11th.  Obviously, it was a response to the nationalistic cry, "God Bless America".  Living in Canada for the past two years has taught me an important lesson about the difference between nationalism and patriotism.  Growing up in the States I never had a huge sense of American pride.  Both my father and grandfather had served in the U.S. military and it made an impression on me when they told me that if I was ever drafted to fight in a war they would both drive me to Canada.  I recall walking out of the theatre after seeing  Saving Private Ryan  thinking that I did not deserve the freedom that those soldiers had fought for simply because I was not personally willing to make the same sacrifice.  However, my informal sense of pacifism did not equate to a disgruntled attitude toward my motherland.  I felt blessed to have been born in America.  Albeit, my thankfulness did not contain any shades of nationalism, but I was in no way ashamed of my country.  The week of the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon, along with hundreds of thousands of other "good" Americans, I put my American flag in the window of my front door.  For what reason, I'm not sure; but, I think I felt that I was in some kind of solidarity with those who had been directly impacted by the attacks.  It was when I moved to Vancouver in August of 2002 that I first began to feel ashamed of my American citizenship.  Listening to the criticisms of Canadians and other non-Americans around me and studying the idolatrous ways that American Christianity has been seduced by the political, economic, and technological forces of modernity quickly encouraged me to shed my national identity.  In fact, there were times when I believe that I had harsher critiques of George W. and his "war against terrorism" than most of my non-American friends.  Maybe it was because I somehow felt personally responsible for the actions of my elected officials or maybe I was also being motivated by personal shame.  Either way, I was not proud to be an American.  Unless I was directly asked, I made it a point to never identify myself as an American; I moved my driver's license to the back of my wallet as to make sure it was not a dead give away; and I made biting comments about the U.S. every chance I got.  The peak of my national shame came when American troops invaded Iraq in March of 2003.  At that point I didn't care if I ever returned as a permanent resident of the United States.  Soon after the "Iraq Conflict" became the "Occupation of Iraq" I heard a lecture from Regent sessional lecturer, Marva Dawn, on the connections between worship, money, and war.  It was, and still is, the best Christian response I've ever heard concerning the conflict in Iraq and war in general.  Marva did a brilliant job of explaining that as a patriot of the U.S., rather than flee the country in response to actions that she disapproved of, it was her responsibility to be a voice and presence of protest in the wake of American idiocy.  I was reminded of the same concept when studying Dietrich Bonhoeffer this fall.  I was impressed to learn that he had escaped to the U.S. when things got really bad under the rule of Hitler, only to return to Germany after being away for only four days.  It was Bonhoeffer's conviction that he couldn't be a part of the reconstruction of his country if he hadn't been a counter-cultural voice and presence during its deconstruction.  All of this is to say that living in Vancouver has taught me the difference between an idolatrous nationalism and a healthy patriotism.  I must admit that I am still substantially biased toward Canada.  Today, July 1, is Canada Day, and although I'm not really sure what event this holiday celebrates I carried myself today with a subtle Canadian pride.  I suppose it's not that surprising.  There are a lot of similarities between the Twin Cities and Canada, and I've always felt a warm affiliation with our brother to the North.  However, unless I quickly find a beautiful Canadian woman that doesn't mind my American blood and thinks I'm kind of cute, I'll more than likely be moving back to the States in April of 2005.  This I have mixed feelings about.  As I often praise Canada up and down, it does have its obvious inadequacies.  For one, much like evangelical Christians, Canadians define themselves not by what they are  for , but by what they are  against .  This, to me, reeks of little-brother-big-brother syndrome.  Canada could do itself a big favor to realize that it is a great nation without making all the bloody comparisons.  If you are against the American ideals, than what are you  for , Canada?  Tell us what makes you so different from your big brother to the south.  Tell us why your polite inactivity in the global political arena isn't simply a result of your financial stature.  These comments go just as well for evangelical Christians.  So you are against sex, drugs, and rock n' roll?  Then tell me what you are for!  My final reflection is this: no matter where we live, it is  good  to have a healthy sense of patriotism for our homeland.  The concept of home is an essential part of what it means to be human.  Without it, we are storyless.  And without stories we lose our identities.  So hold your nation and fellow country men and women in high regard--even if they are Bush loving, gun-toting, Wal-Mart shoppers.  Love your people unconditionally and pray for them, too.  Conversely, do not neglect our prophetic role in our homelands.  Speak out against injustice and greed; speak for community, life, and love!
