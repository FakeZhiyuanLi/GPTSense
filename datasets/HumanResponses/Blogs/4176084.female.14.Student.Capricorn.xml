      Well, My first practice of varsity swim. The coach told me so casually that they didn't have my physical(which sucked ass because they didn't even call my name the night before with the list of other swimmers who didn't have theirs either), and that I had to sit for 4 hours watching everyone else sweat. Whats worse, is I can't practice at all, and I HAVE to go to each practice. They don't even count as practices either, so I have to miss the first few meets.  Luideagach Athar is gone. I dunno why I made a site with my drawings when I am such a bad artist. I eman, I have DeviantArt for that. So I made one for my dolls. Though right now I have alot of my old and crappy ones one there. The name of it is In Your Head. Audrey Hepburn is the star of my layout. Only one of my friends knew who she was. And for those retards reading this who also don't know who she is, she's a famous actress from a long time ago.  Tonight I'm sleeping over at Sarah's new apartment. They're picking me up at 7. It's awesome cause now she's gonna live alot closer to where I live. And she lives near Woods Valley.  I finally got up to the next level today at The Underground. I officially have 400 posts and I rank onto the second rank thingy-ma-jigger. My dream is to be a Watcher, the highest rank of them all, besides Administrator.  Alright, I'm gonna clean my room and do my chores so I have time to pack for Sarah's.

      I made a new avatar for the UG yesterday. GIF screwed the shading up on the shirt, though.  I went to a meeting/picnic thing at the captain of the swim team's house. It sucked. The best part was laughing at a fat poser girl in the pool. Well, practiced start tommorrow which are everyday except for sundays, from 8am-noon. We mostly run and swim. I had to get new running shoes tonight. They're orange and gray. On Friday we're biking, which I can't wait for. At least it's not just swimming like modified was. Oh yeah, all the seniors are really funny, but all the sophmores are poser assholes.  Oh yeah, I found my "No Need To Argue" CD for The Cranberries. My dad took it to work and forgot about it. WOOHOO! Now I don't have to listen to their other CD I have which sucks old man hair!  I gotta go to bed now, I wanna have time to shower before i go to practice.

      Yesterday night was awesome. First we went to a chinese buffet. Then we went to Radio Shack, because we had time to blow off before the movie started. The movie was absolutly fantastic. There wasn't as much action as I thought there would be, and some of the story line is based around a love story, but it's really not one of those gooshy romance films. There's a surprise twist at the end, which I thought might happen early on in the movie.It is now my most favorite movie ever. The Others doesn't even compare to The Village. Oh yeah, and after the movie we went to Nicky Doodles for ice cream.  John was supposed to come to our house today to talk about stuff I'm not aloud to write in this. Accually I'm not supposed to tell anyone, but 3 of my friends already know, oops. He was supposed to be here at noon and he called around 4 sayting that he couldn't make it . I accually woke up on my own at 10:30am to clean the house up a little bit before he came. I am so proud of myself. His girlfriend Luann probably had something to do with it. She's a bitch.  I write too much. I also talk too much. I'm gonna stop writing now.

      Okay, today started out with the power going out at 4 when I was writing my new fanfiction and getting to the good part. Then Sarah called me at noon and woke me from my sleep. I sat around all day in my room trying to write the rest of the story, but I had a major stomahc ache, so I climbed a tree in my yard and sat there for a while. Then we had to take my sisters to my "Grammy's" work, so she can take them home for the weekend as planned. Then when we were driving home I asked my dad if we were doing anything tonight. He just sat in silence and didn't answer me for 5 minutes. Then he called mom on his cell phone and made plans. (Yay!)  So now when my mom gets home in an hour, we're gonna go out to eat, then we're gonna go see "The Village" at the new cinima's in New Hartford. I can't wait. My AIM is now working and it didn't get cancelled after-all. I have no doubt its gonna do this again, but I think it's gonna be one of those on and off deals. I gotta go do laundry now.

      Today was very fufilling. Full of chores and phone calls at 10 in the morning when I don't even wake up until at least noon.  Tonight I baby sat 4 kids for 5 hours. There was one infant, a 3 year old, a 5 year old and a 10 year old. I only got 13 dollars. When the parents came home, she handed me a wad of dollar bills and said she paid me 15 dollars, 3 dollars per hour. Well, the usual charge for them is 8 dollars and hour(2 dollars per kid per hour), but since they got a new house and they have 4 kids, I let them go by 4 dollars an hour. I was supposed to get 20 tonight. So at first I thought, 5 dollars less, whatever. Then I counted it when I logged on 5 minutes ago and they paid me 2 dollars short! God, 13 dollars.  My parents got a few dvds to watch, and since my AIM name got cancelled (another reason why I had a bad day), I'm just gonna go watch them. But on the bright side, I'm 13 dollars richer.

      I stayed up last night because I felt like it. Now I am really tired. I'm at my grandparents house right now. Bonnie and her husband are coming over. She is so strong, she may get well again. It's just her attitude. For all she knows she's living until she's 120 years old. John and Luann are coming over at 7. Bonnie's not here yet, but she should in 20 minutes or so.  Tommorrow I'm gonna wake up early and finish re-writing my fanfiction. I signed up for phototbucket.com today so I can hotlink my pictures for The Underground. I also need something to hotlink because I am getting a custom made icon from this artist. I have some of her Harry Potter icons on the enter page of my site. I need to get a picture of myself and either another person, or a landscape. I've decided on that.  Bonnies here, I have to go now.

      Well, I stayed up all night and I fell asleep at noon today by accident. I woke up around 6 for dinner, where I just sat there thinking about crap. I forgot to take my calcium pills, but that's okay. I'm what I like to call myself a semi-lack toast and tolerant. I can eat butter and ice cream, but I can only have milk at certain times of the day, otherwise I get really sick. Like I can never have cereal in the morning for example. And that's why I have to take calcium pills.  I want school to start up, it's so boring being by myself EVERY DAY. The best part of my summer was probably going to Enchanted Forrest, and camping overnight with my family, John and Luann. But going to the mall with Katrina was really fun too. Oh yeah, and the Rennaissance Festival.  I have 6 chapters of my fanfiction up. 7 more to go until I'm caught up. Woohoo! But its the last chapters I really have to work on. My pen name used to be arissaviola. Cause I couldn't think of anything and when I can't think of anything I use that. Even though I hate it. Well, I changed it yesterday to Ellie Manchester. I'm not quite sure I like it yet. It just has a ring to it that I like. I was trying to think of something like Lemony Snicket, something stupid like that. Oh well. Oh shit, I should have used Chester Moistmuffins XD  Tommorrow I have to sign up for photobucket, so my images will show on The Underground. They only allow new users to sign up between 10 and 2 so I have to make sure I'm online then. I am also getting a new domain name. But I have to wait for 2 to 4 weeks to sign up for that. I got a shorter URL change, but it makes a million hostdepartment pop-ups show up on my site, so I'm just gonna use the one until I get my domain name.  Well, I wanna finish my fanfiction now.

      Well, I stayed up until 6am last night and I woke up around 1:30pm today. Eh, I'm not really tired. I spent my day online(not that that's anything new), and thats pretty much it.  Oh yeah, my mom's car broke down a week ago and the people at the car place told her how much it would cost to get it fixed today. 900 dollars. That's over 4 months of car payments. It sucks, as if we're not poor enough as it is. So since that happened, we're probably not gonna go go-karting or go to Albany with my dad as we planned, seeing he has all this week off. And I'm also not gonna go to "The Village" this weekend like my mom told me.  Yeah, my sisters are gonna stay at my grandparents house this weekend and my parents sleep all during the weekend. So I'm gonna be all alone. This week was supposed be awesome, but all because of the damned car it's gonna be as boring as hell.  We went to my grandparents house tonight I didn't do anything, besides annoy people. Oh yeah, I watched this ER show with Papa. It was all gorry and nasty, I was wincing just looking at all the blood and such. I hate those shows. But it's not like there was anything else to do. I am now using tonight as time to catch up on my fanfiction. So far I have 6 more chapters to go. I've decided to not work on Deviantart until I have everything else caught up on.

      Some general information. My name is Arissa. I am 14 and I'm going into 9th grade (Freshman, woohoo!). My life is based around my friends and the internet. I have a website where I post some of my random sketches and I'm currently thinking about posting my dolls on it also. I play guitar(4 years), bass(electric, 2 years and upright, 1 year this fall) and piano(since I was 4, but seriously started about a year or so ago). I also sing alot. I hate choruses, and I haven't a clue why this is my 4th year and I'm still in it. I love plain old acting.  Musicals are okay, but its too many people and it's not half as fun as a small group of actors. Uh, I live in a small town in the middle of New York. I have 2 siblings and my parents are together. I think that's enough general information for now.  As you can read from the title and that last paragraph, this is my first entry. Hmm...My history of blogs and journals. My first blog was one provided by Tripod, when my site was hosted by them. Soon later, I got a Ujournal. I had that for a long while. I then heard about Live Journal. I would bet I've had my Live Journal for the longest. I'm not quite sure why I got Blogger, But I think it's because of the really cool profiles, *hehe*. I'm not thinking about deleting my account on Live Journal until I really know my way around here and I'm sure I wanna stick with it.  Well, so much for my first entry...
