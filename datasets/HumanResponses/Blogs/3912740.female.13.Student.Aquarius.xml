      Chapter One December 13, 2090  Darkness filled her eyes as she woke that cold December night.  Terror filled her ears and took her soul to the obscurity that enveloped her.  This darkness caressed her as the screams of girls wrapped her in its clutches and pored into her head filling it with pain.  Her eyes fluttered open to find nothing.  Nothing was around her yet she could feel and hear it.  There were girls, invisible girls, lost in the pure black that filled the room.  She was leaning against something as her eyes searched the darkness, looking for any trace of life or light.  Her heart began to pound its way out of her poor chest as her hands find their way to the spot that her heart pounds against her ribs and she holds that spot being sure of what would happen if she moved her shaking hand. She closed her eyes from this piercing darkness that stung them and saw a flash.  Her hand sat against her head with her fingers running through her hair as she tried to take in the swirling sounds of screaming and horror.  She saw a flash and in the center of the light stood a figure of a person holding out their hands.  Then the light was gone and all was dark again only to be welcomed by another flash and smoke filled her nose.  She closed her eyes tighter and opened them once again with a shriek from her vision as she tried to take this all in. Pain suddenly struck her leg and head like lightning.  She gave out a cry for the pain was so great.  Confusion flooded all of her emotions and captured fear and anger as she screamed along with the others.  Her arm wrapped around her stomach and tears filled her eyes as they lightly trickled down her cheeks landing in darkness.  She helplessly called out for her family.  "Mère ! Père ! Mother!  Father!  Boyce me répond s'il vous plaît ! Boyce please answer me!   Où êtes-vous ? Where are you?  Où suis-je ? Where am I?  Etes-vous là-bas dans l'obscurité ? Are you there in the darkness?” Floods soon fell from her cheeks as she sat quietly waiting for something to happen-something to help her understand what was going on.  Yelling was of no use anymore.  Her hand wrapped around her stomach as if the room was moving and making her sick.  Her head spun and she became dizzy with the noise and the confusion.  There was no reply from her family as she sat there trying to listen to each voice separately to see if her family was calling her.  Some of the voices she couldn’t understand and soon she gave up because they all mixed together like a choir and sounded as one voice crying terror in the night. Just as in her vision a giant light spread throughout the darkness quickly eating it away.  Darlene closed her eyes tight and slowly opened them to find at least 50 girls all sitting on the floor of a giant wooden box.  None of them were a good sight, for they had cuts all along their faces, arms, and legs.  Darlene looked to the light and saw land-there was no more darkness.  She wanted to smile at the presence of the light but couldn’t now knowing and seeing the girls that were so battered and terrified.  Girls were screaming and holding cuts and scrapes to stop the bleeding.  She lifted her hand and saw blood on it and she didn’t know where it came from.  Was it hers or some one else’s?  Her stomach tied up in a knot and she looked around at all of the glossy cheeks that hold tears out of fear and loss.   Darlene looked around at each person she could.  Some were big sisters protecting their little sisters from any more pain as they held them against their dirty and bruised bodies.  More tears fell down her cheeks and her heart began to hurt and sink to her stomach.  What has happened here?  She looks to the person beside her who is still sleeping having no clue of what was going on around her.  She pitied this girl knowing her confusion and emotions of waking up in the darkness.  There was light now, and she hoped that there would still be light when this poor girl woke up.  A very cold winter breeze filled the room and left all the girls shivering.  Darlene felt her hands and feet go numb from the nipping cold then she looked down at her legs where a big cut was sitting there engraved in her calf mussel.  Her stomach got tighter as she looked at her leg and wondered where this happened at and why she wasn’t aware of it.  Then her attention was drawn to the door where girls sat peeking out wondering if they are suppose to get out or not.  The first girl by the door bravely scooted her leg out of the box they were in and set a foot on one of the steps that lead to the ground.  Darlene didn’t think that it was right, and she never did anything she had any doubts about.  Finally the girl was out and a few followed.  Darlene didn’t move, along with a few other girls, and watched these girls as they ventured out into the coldness of the morning.  Darlene heard a man’s voice yell, followed by a woman’s voice.  They yelled, “Get back in you stupid European nitwits!  Get back in!” Girls shrieked and scurried into the car as two figures chased them in yelling louder, “Get out and we’ll shoot you!” She then got it.  This was about the war--this war against the North Americans and the Europeans.  She hated war and violence and knowing this was about the war made her angry.  Fury boiled in her stomach but she calmed down quickly remembering all of the girls in the car that were prisoners of this hate now.  Her leg began to sting as she thought more and more of how this couldn’t be real—she had to have been dreaming it.  How could this happen to her?  This world she had been forced into swirled around in her head pushing tears from her eyes.  She gasped remembering her family.  Was there anyone around she knew?  She had light now-she could look!  Her eyes searched excitedly around the room thinking her mother was there but her eyes slowed down looking at each girl over and over and never finding her mother.  She took a deep breath in and held it as tears began to stream down her face collecting at her chin and lips.  Disappointment overwhelmed her as it crashed into her heart and soul making it so they hurt badly.  Where was her mother?  She was alone there, watching sisters protect their little sisters.  Then a small girl caught her eye. She looked at the trembling girl whom had a cut on her forehead and on her arm.  The girl was covered in dust with torn clothes and glossy cheeks from crying her small tears.  Darlene moved closer to the girl and tried to move so that she was sitting next to her.  She did get that way but her legs were laying on top of a sleeping girl’s lap and if she moved her legs she would have kicked some one else so decided to keep them there.  She looked down at the tiny girl with curly golden hair and leaned over so her mouth was beside her ear.  “Do you know what happened here?”  She asked the small girl, not expecting anything helpful. The girl began to cry hard with tears filling her eyes and flowing swiftly down her cheeks.  “We’re all going to die!”  She screamed out. Darlene looked around, looking for any other girls who might have heard her scream those words as she placed her hand over her mouth.  Luckily, the others were too wrapped up in their fear and screams that they did not hear her.  She looked back down at the girl and asked, “Why do you say such things?” She took her hand off of her mouth and the girl seemed to calm down some as she said, breathing heavy, “I heard another girl say it, she told us all!  Their going to kill us all!” Darlene began to be frightened thinking maybe this girl she heard was a guard.  She put her arm around the girl and stroked her hair with the other and asked calmly, “What’s your name?” The girl looked up at her with her big shy blue eyes and said, “Carol McLane.” Darlene smiled as she began to softly rock and she said, “Carol, do you know about God, the heaven, and angels?” Carol shook her tiny head as tears gently moved down her cheeks.  “Please tell me.” She said, with curiosity in her voice. “Well,” Darlene said in her softest tone, yet loud enough for her to hear over all the screams, “A long, long time ago a spirit lived-a light.  His name was God and he created the Earth, the planets, and the people on them along with all the life around it.  He created angels and a place far, far away called heaven.  At the beginning of time God sent a man to Earth names Jesus who healed and died for all the sins of people.  Jesus died on the cross because of the sins of man because he loved every one so much.  After he died this allowed people who believed in Jesus and God and loved them with all their heart, soul, and minds would become an angel and live forever with God in Heaven.  You would live happily with streets of gold and light all the time.  No one hates or kills and there is love behind every rock.  Doesn’t that sound wonderful Carol?” Carol pictured this place called heaven and this Light called God as she smiled.  She nodded her head and said, “Yes…I can see it now and it is beautiful.” Just as Darlene smiled girls began to point and shriek and back away from the door as the figure of a giant man stood in the light.  It was clear that he was holding a giant gun in his arms and that made girls scream even louder and with more alarm.  Darlene took Carol’s head quickly as both their smiles fell from their faces and fear took over.  She pressed her head to her chest and held it there with her arms as Carol began to cry once more.  Darlene tried to protect the girl, for she had grown very attached to her.  She watched as the man stood there waving his gun around screaming, “Quiet!  Quiet you dimwits!  All of you!  Get quiet now!” His voice was filled with so much hate that her heart began to hurt as she was being filled with wrath.  His voice cracked as he tried to scream over the girls, yet Darlene just sat there pulling Carol even closer to her as the man’s gun entered the room.  Darlene’s heart began to skip in her chest as it moved up to her throat.  She felt the bullet going into her and the pain even though it was not shot yet and she worried that carol’s life may be taken from her.  She closed her eyes tightly and held Carol’s head to her still as the gun was shot off.  There was only one shot as Darlene let her breath out and she opened her eyes to see what had happened.  She quickly looked at Carol to make sure she wasn’t hurt as she let her head go.  Tears clung onto her cheeks as she looked around at the girls.  Darlene saw a hole in the wall as more light shone in on the frightened and, now, silent girls as she saw terror in their eyes and pale faces.  The man looked at all the girls and began to laugh as he said, “Finally I got all you idiots quiet!” He laughed some more as the girls became angry and afraid knowing this man has a gun and could easily shoot and kill them.  Darlene and Carol sat close to the door as they both waited in suspense for this man to tell them what’s going to happen.   He finally stopped laughing and said loudly looking at every terrified girl, “Your going to Germany where you will be either killed or taken on a train to a boat which will take you to New York!”  he turned and mumbled loudly, “I hope your all killed jerks!” The door slammed shut and they were back into the pure darkness that engulfed them once before.  To Darlene’s surprise, there was no screaming.  The girls began to talk to the other or to themselves for they were now so terrified of being killed that they could not scream any more.   Darlene held Carol and she felt the little body shaking in fear.  She shook as if she were cold and freezing or as if there were an earthquake shaking the room.  Darlene looked down at darkness and said quietly, “Carol, Carol are you okay?” The hole in the wall gave little light as it ran like ribbon across the room and shone on one of Carol’s blue eyes as Darlene heard a quiet and quavering reply, “Yes.” The car then started to move and all the girls gave a little cry of surprise for they all feel themselves move one way and hit some one beside them.  Darlene and Carol looked all around yet saw nothing.  As Darlene looked around the blackness of the room she heard a small child’s voice say softly, “I’m scared.” She began to stoke Carol’s hair in the darkness as she said calmly to the frightened child, “It’s going to be all right, Carol.  Just think of the heavens and close your eyes.  Every thing will be all right, you will see.” Darlene sat there thinking of what the man said to them, wondering if it was true.  How would they decide who would live and who would die?  Fear flooded her mind and soul as she thought of Carol being killed.  This poor girl who has done nothing to these people, may die.  She sat there with Carol’s head against her shoulder as she petted her soft angel like hair and softly hummed as the girl closed her eyes and swiftly fell into her dreams.  Gradually, the car got quiet and soon almost silent as Darlene thought of God taking her by the hand leading her to heaven where she would be happy.  She closed her eyes and thought of peace and love and soon she drifted off into her dreams as well.  A flash of light woke up all the girls in the room.  Each moaned as they slowly opened their eyes to see what the light was.  Darlene opened hers and looked down at Carol who was sleeping in her arms.  Her legs were still across the other’s lap and she was still in this room with all of these girls.  She was disappointed hoping that this was only a dream and that she was home with her family eating warm biscuits and drinking hot tea but this was real.  Carol rubbed her eye with her small hand as she yawned and said sleepily to Darlene, “What’s going on?” “I don’t know, Carol.” Just then a woman stood at the door and said loudly, “Wake up!  Stand up now!  Stand up!” She repeated the words “stand up” over and over again as if she were a broken record as they all stumbled to stand up.  Darlene told Carol to stay down until she got up so she could help her stand up.  Darlene pushed against the wall and got up slowly.  Her legs began to wobble and she almost fell until she stretched them out and leaned against the wall so she didn’t fall.  She held out her hand to Carol and said, “Now, this may be hard for you, Carol, but I know you can do it.” Carol nodded and grabbed her hand tightly as she lifted herself up.  She wobbled and she shook but eventually she was standing there.  Darlene smiled and said, “Well, look at you!  Your better than I am!” The woman kept going on and on until every girl in the car was standing up.  Once they were all up the woman finally said, “Stand here and you will leave the car shortly!” All the girls stood there looking around at the faces and legs of all the girls.  Darlene’s leg began to hurt as she leaned against the wall holding Carol’s hand in hers.  Quickly another woman came to the door and looked around to see if every one was standing.  Once she was done looking she stood there and called out, “You will all exit sing file!” The woman turned around sharply and began to walk.  She took a few steps and a girl bravely walked stupidly out of the car followed by another girl and then another.  Darlene looked down at Carol who was edger to get out in the light and said motherly, “Wait Carol, we will be near the end.” The girls kept moving out.  All were pale and weak now for they have been in the train car for who knows how long.  Soon Darlene walked out and down the steps in a limp and Carol followed walking-almost skipping her way out into the light.  They walked into the train station and then out where there was a line forming.  Darlene’s eyebrows raised and her eyes grew big remembering that they were either killed or taken to New York!  She looked back at Carol trying to look calm and she said, “I’m glad we’re up and in the light aren’t you?” The line moved closer to the front as Carol said happily, “Oh yes it makes me very happy!” Darlene faked a smile as they moved closer and closer.  The line was moving at a rapid pace and before they knew it they were almost 10th in line.  Darlene’s eyes began to water as she looked at Carol who smiled and looked around happily humming a small tune of hers.  Darlene watched each girl as they were sent into 2 lines.  One was to a train and the other was to a room where she heard gun shots periodically and knew that’s where the girls were killed.  A lump formed in her throat as she began to fear the death of Carol and as she felt the pistol, enter her body and fill her every cell with pain and death.  One thing came to mind and she looked at Carol and said trying to smile and not cry, “Do you remember the story of the heavens and the angels?” Carol nodded her head with a smile that engulfed her face and she said merrily, “I dreamt of it last night.” Darlene’s heart caught fire as she felt the blood around it burn.  She swallowed hard and said, “Do you believe it all?  Do you trust and love God?” “With all my heart, mind, and soul.” Darlene looked at the line and she realized she was next!  She began to breathe hard and her heart began to knock at her ribs almost pumping its way out of her chest.  Was she to live or die?  The girl in front of her was sent to the room to be shot and killed and as she watched her walk to the room her eyes began to burn and beg for tears to fall but she would not let them.  As the man asked her to come she took in a breath and walked slowly to the desk not breathing at all.  She moved her head so she saw Carol happily standing there almost jumping with joy as she watched.  The man told her to slowly spin around and she did.  She felt her head get light and she watched at the world spin slowly around her.  Then she stopped and the man’s stick pointed in the direction of the train.  She let her breath go as she walked over to the train and stopped to watch Carol.   Her heart never stopped racing knowing that Carol has a 50/50 chance of being killed or living.  Darlene began to cry as she watched. “How old are you there?”  A man asked her. “I’m 5 Sir.” She said proudly and sweetly. Without even looking the man’s stick pointed in the direction of the room and Darlene gave out a cry and disappointment fell upon Carol’s sweet little face.  “But I want to go with her.” She said sadly. Darlene gave out another cry and ran to Carol and held her and said as the men tried to pull them apart, “Carol tell me you truly believe in God!  Tell me you truly care about him!” Carol was not crying but turning pale as she nodded.  “Carol if you believe you will be there!  You dreamt of it last night would you like to be an angel?  Be happy with God?” Carol didn’t answer as the men pulled on them.  They got them apart and Darlene said calling out to Carol, “Carol, your going to be an angel-you will be happy with God please believe!” Carol heard this and broke out in tears as a man began to pull her to the room.  She began to kick and cry and yell for Darlene over and over.  As Darlene was being dragged away from Carol she heard her scream, “Darlene!  Darlene don’t let them make me leave you!  I love you!” Darlene began to kick and scream as the man picked her up like a little child and carried her to her room.  She was dropped into the car of the train and she saw Carol still thrusting her arms out from the man.  She got up and the door slammed just as she was about to run out and she tried to open it but it was locked.  She whimpered Carol’s name and soon began to yell it.  She ran to her window and began to pound on it with her fists as she saw Carol thrown to the ground as a man quickly took a gun from his pouch.  Then she heard a ring and watched as the figure of a body laid on the ground not moving…not breathing.  Her hand slid down the window and she began to cry loudly.  She looked up at the sky and said in a whisper, “God save her.”
