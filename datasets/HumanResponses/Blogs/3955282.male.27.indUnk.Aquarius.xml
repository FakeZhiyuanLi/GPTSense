      i had another dream about her, about D, and this one was a bit more misunderstood.&nbsp; i'm not totally sure how i should see it, but all i remember is we were in some type of hotel type building or something, and we were trying to find a way to an event we were going to.&nbsp; the part i remember was walking down a hallway and she put her hands against my waist, so i grabbed them and wrapped them around my chest in a backwards hug.&nbsp; i felt an energetic sensation, everything felt great, and as both of us were beaming smiles i spun her around to kiss her, and looked her in the eye and put my hands on her cheeks and leaned in and she had this apprehension in her eyes...so i said "kiss me" and she said no, no what are you doing?&nbsp; i can't do this...and walked away and disappeared...i spent the majority of the dream after that chasing her around trying to explain and apologize or something...

      Goin to lunch at Fridays...its fucking hot out STILL...when will this hellish weather end...blahhhh....I'm gaining frustration for people, there is so much strife and disillusion in humans it isn't funny.  They put such faith in thinking they can change some asshole into something defineably different...people don't change with influence of others, they will only change under their own volition.

      so i started my yoga training tonight...i got halfway through the workout (12 poses--i did 6) and realized how horribly out of shape i am.  my legs are burning from the stretching...seems this may be a good way to go for me, as long as i can keep myself motivated to do it.  i just keep looking at my gut hanging down when i am sitting, and it gives me a reminder that i need to lose it if i want to be sexy again.  oh, and i did my hair again.  i also think one of my hafadas screwed up in healing, i had an issue with both of them, but the left came out alright, but the right one never healed properly and i think it's going to end up migrating :(  guess i'll have to redo that one too, along with all the other ones.  ah well, sure it's more money, but i'm supporting my hobby and the enthusiasts by giving them cash i'd spend on other useless crap anyway.  i am getting more of my tattoo finished this coming thursday as well, watch for new pics of it when i get that done.
