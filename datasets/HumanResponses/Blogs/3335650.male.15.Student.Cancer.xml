      Intro Right... so I guess I have an obligation to tell you who we are, right? (The answer's yes :-p ) Well... Here goes...  LoZ (Me) Age: 14, nearly 15 Sex: As often as possible (sorry, couldn't resist) Male Location: York, small town in north-england What i look like: *insert bloody picture here, i dunno how to yet* *gives up* long black hair, green eyes, whiteish brownish skin, quite tall... i'll chuck a pic on uploadit.org as soon as i can :-)  Jonny (He'll post here soonish, like maybe tomorrow) Age: 14, also nearly 15, but 1 month older than LoZ Sex: Male Location: Same as LoZ What he looks like: Blonde, short hair, blue eyes (i think) bit taller'n LoZ. White skin (get in the sun, you msn addict :-P ) Pic also soon on it's way!  Both: We go to school together and are forced to sit next to each other. Nah not really heh, but when I was first told I was sittin next to him, I was horrified... suicidal even! (just messin, jonny!)  Anyway, we drive our teachers crazy by singing our pencil case, dictionary and maybe rap in class. Or we just talk crap :D Oh, we're in year 9 btw...  If I've left anything out, leave me a comment :-)  Anyway, really gotta go sleep, I've got school tomorrow... again... IT SUCKS! Over 'n' out!

      Do you think I should allow her to stay? I mean, she's cute n funny, but will she spout as much rubbish as she did tonight? I'm undecided, as she'll no doubt be rather upset if i remove her... You decide! Comment on the post below, as this one's mail2blog and so doesn't (yet) have a comments button...  Talking about Lou, will you be at the skate park tomorrow? Be cool if you are :)  LoZ

      Oh! She beat me to it! Oh well... now only Jonny's missing... I'll ring him up and complain about him not gettin his account sorted yet :P I feel sorry for him already!  I'm amazed at how many comments I've had already, considerin this blog's less than 24 hours old... and not to mention e-mails :-) Oh well... makes me feel wanted i guess :D Apologies about Lou, I guess you caught her in one of her "funny" moods ;-) best not say too much stuff along those lines, or she'll come round and beat me up! Nah not really, but she's a touch nuts occasionally... Why have i let her onto my blog? Oh I dunno, thought you could do with a little excitement ;-)  Tell me if she does anything tooo outrageous... please? I've got to be off, mum wants me to look upo some flight times for her...

      Mum lost her keys this morning, I lost my headset for my phone and, to cap it all, I was almost run over by a lorry on my way to school...  Once I got to school, we were all told that we have loads of revision. Great. Oh and jonny's skiving, so you'll have to do without him :-(  Gtg, I've got maths to do :-((((  LoZ

      Morning all! Today we've got... Maths, french, gym... and something else, I've forgotten what :lol:   I found this today:  "Why cant a blonde dial 911?... 'cos she cant find eleven"  What do boys have against blondes?   Admittedly, they're sometimes a touch dopey, but then they're usually the prettier ones, so I wouldn't take the piss outa 'em 'cos if you're taking the mick then it's not gonna improve your chances with 'em  But yeah, hell, it's still funny ;-)   LoZ

      "good storie about singin. very enter-trainin. is this the same hippi school as improvin lou men-shunned?"  Yay! someone enjoys my posts! Erm... it's not really a hippy school. Just some people call it that.  I stayed out at the skatepark with Lou til ten when I said I'd be back by half-nine, so my parents have decided to ban me from skatin saturday nights til I'm 16. Life can be bitch sometimes.  Oh well it's ok really, considering it's the only night I'.m free, or rather, used to be (put the sarcasm tags in there yourself) I'll put up some pics of Me n Lou in about half an hour but  i promised to take em down if she didn't like em... @Lou: Just like to say that it was  nice being with you tonight :-) That's wat true friends are for! xx  LoZ   http://thepencilcase.blogspot.com

      oh a genuinely witty reply!  "u want i cricket (correct, but with emphasis on our game) my spillin of words ( go figure..) cos, loz, u don't see two meanins in holidaze??? r u a teachya? letts forge-it all the lessons that lessens us!!! Police release me, let me go...( do i hav to put in brackets 'joke' or can i not just make a choke?)most or'll of us want to hear about singin."  Erm... no i'm not a "teachya", just a school-kid with a knack for spelling... But that's beside the point. If the singing lesson's what you want to hear about, that's what I'll tell you :) So... at the moment in our singing lessons we're doing a song which is called "Pastime with Good Company", do a search on google and i'm sure you'll find it somewhere. It's by Henry the 8th and, despite our singing teachers repeated insistence to the contrary, it's incredibly dull. As a result, we have to find ourselves something else to do... so we thought, which is something our class is rarely guilty of doing, and came up with an excellent idea which only need 3 things: A willing volunteer (victim?), a chair, and some computer power cable. While my mates collected the necessary materials, I talked to the teacher about various singing-orientated subjects, like voice tests, note ranges and some stuff I didn't deem worthy of remembrance, to distract him, although it seemed quite unnecessary as he seemed to be engrossed in his own little world of note pitches and what-not. Once the required hardware had been found, it was a simple competition to see who could design and build the best restraint device... and let me tell you, some were, well, rather "original".  Then we found a plastic bag, cut holes in it, and used it as a hood. The teacher was still oblivious as to what was going on, if you can  possibly  believe that... Admittedly, there weren't any orange jumpsuits or guards with dogs, but there's nothing like snogging a vacuum cleaner for a torture method. I hope you appreciate the story, as I wrote the whole thing on my phone, and it took me forever ;-) Laters! Loz p.s. god only knows what Lou will be doing skating: She can barely stand on a deck, let alone 360° heelflip one!

      Just in: (no timberlake :D ) "the ?'s about holdaze was for you. i havnt posted to lou; she being *cough*strange*. or ynot tell about tying up lad--while singing???-- also so con'fused', rilly *c'on.,foo*sed... " Ok, i don't mean to sound mean (pun there), but you spelling really is appalling... even by my year 9 standards... My sister, who's six, can write better! l'm not asking for 100% spelling, just for you to read through what you've written and correct it. Anyways... My holidays:Nothing planned for half-term, but in the summer I'll be flying to switzerland a couple of times :) that's the life! Also have a 10-day class-trip to sweden coming up, but don't worry, I'll keep you updated by e-mail over my phone. If you're lucky, you'll even get pictures :)  In other news:  A txt from Lou: "Yellow! Im bored and my feet hurt! =o(xxxxxxxxxxx" Well, Lou, my dear, what do you expect me to do about that?  That's what I could reply with, if l was being sincere or something, but seeing as I have no credit at this point in time, speculating 'bout my reply's rather pointless anyway... sorry Lou! Just doing my paper-round...  Oh what fun!   Laters!  LoZ

      "why not let lou stay an keep her account but give a better account of herself??"  Not sure I quite follow what you mean... Do you mean keep better tabs on her?  I think I will let her stay, after all, yesterday was friday night and she might just have been exceptionally nuts... I hope... I don't really mind her little outbursts as long as you find them funny/entertaining but if she doesn't learn how to punctuate her sentences, well... not even you can save her :P  But I'll give u a little description of her anyway...  Name: Lou Age: 12 Sex: Female Location: York What she looks like: A human form of a nuclear missile, crossed with a goldfish... Not really :P Lou's got blonde/brown hair, brown eyes, white skin (yes, another msn addict), oh, and she's quite short.  Have a nice weekend peeps!  LoZ

      Grr today my phone decided to break! It's a P800 so a rather *big* investment for someone like me... But luckily, I've got insurance :-) In the end, it wasn't actually needed, 'cos I've got the required TORX 8 screwdriver, and I could fix it...  I got called a mummy's boy today, by a girl in my year, 'cos I had chores n stuff to do and couldn't go skating. Am I a mummy's boy? I don't think so! Seein as it was me who was out tooooo late (btw, i think i might be forgiven *phew*) and it was also me who was "marshmallowed" (it says somewhere in the blogger help to put this instead of ****** to make your blog "mom friendly"), I think mommy's boy's the last thing  anyone  can call me!  Anyways... blog's been a bit quiet today... guess it's 'cos it's sunday, or something... Does any one have any idea how to add a hit counter to this blog? I'm one of those people who like looking at numbers :P Guess that's why I'm doing maths GCSE... Couldn't have anything to do with the fact that it's compulsory could it? I'm also doing french, but I'm nooooo good at it :-( Oh well... if anyone fancies lending me the part of the brain that's responsible for languages I'd be willing to buy you an ice-cream :P Anyway, I'm off to have my bath...

Lou doesn't seem to get comments sent to her as she isnt classed as admin Anyway, hi to you too! "hello this is alex i was walking by when i saw this amazing site and i had to stop by and piss allll over it so hi" Hi alex, we're honoured!  P.s. any more comments like that and  i will ban you   You have been warned! "sorri to hear bad news.did lou get banned too?? seems unfair. u sed u had onli sat free.Y? homework? ******* homework. will your parents stick to keepin u off skatepark satnites til u r 16? harsh.  bi-the-wayside, i wood sign in but havin t'rubble with accounts. i hope things get GoodLuckin" No, Lou did not get banned, she has nice parents.

      Hey everyone! Yeah I am  really  banned :-( Although you could all come over to mine and hang-out in the park, or something... although that wouldn't be quite as fun. Are you gonna be in fulford again today? I really like bein with you guys, you're all so nuts, unlike the girls in our class, who either decide for no reaaon to be pissed off with me, or are just toooooo sane for me when they aren't pissed off with me! I should have some pics of Jordan somewhere...  For those of you who don't know whi he is, he's this random kid, who skates. An example of his randomness: I skate over the jumpbox and nearly hit him, and he stands in front of me, and says, in a deranged voice, "Hello and welcome to Norway, if you look on the right, you'll see a giant hedgehog, eating pineapples!"

      Good evening blog! Today my phone was jacked (stolen)... so much for fixing it yesterday! Oh well, I have insurance and am getting a better one instead as mine isn't produced anymore. Not a bad deal for me then!  Still, if anyone sees a townie (cough, spit) with a cap on (i know, they all wear them) on a rusty blue bike (stolen, they all are) then tell me where and when and I'll give them... a little visit :-P And if anyone sees a P800 with imei 350443-10-337043-1 please, please tell me! Today school sucked a bit more than usual, everyone seems to be in a piss with me for no reason, and I have no idea why... usually when people are pissed off with me, they have a good reason, but this time i really don't have any idea what I've done. Actually it's not everyone, but it's still annoying... actually it's only four people... oh well, I guess there's more fish in the sea. Just a shame it's the people who are most popular. Oh well, I guess I always have Lou =o) Talking of Lou, haven't seen you in ages on here! Ok, I saw you at school, but it's not quite the same =o]  I mentioned my teacher saw this page... luckily he took a humorous approach to my actions and I didn't get into trouble, and luckily it *wasn't* my singing teacher! There was one message which was time-stamped in lesson time and I don't know if he was convinced by my explanation of being able to change them when you post a new message. You can, right? 'Cos I saw a setting  in post message: advanced, where you can change the time and even set it to auto-publish at a given time. I love Blogger!  Anyway, I'm off to do something now, not sure what, but I've run out of things to type =op Look after yourselves! LoZ

      Hi There! Sorry i didn't post yesterday, I was a touch too busy to write much. Oh well. At least i thought of something exciting to tell you all...  *~_-N E W S  F L A S H-_~*  Today it emerged that Lou's bottle of coke had been kidnapped and is being held to ransom at an unknown location, by a terrorist organisation who call themselves LoZ. It is not yet clear how much the group are demanding for the bottles release, but estimates place the number at about 5 and a half pence. Police have found few clues as to the whereabouts of the bottle but say they are hopeful of recovering it.  Below is the letter sent to Lou, demanding the ransom:   Dear Lou,   We are a terrorist organisation. We have captured your bottle of coke, and if you don't pay us at least enough to get a chomp bar from the corner shop, I'm afraid that we will have to burn your bottle of coke alive. You have 48 hours in within which you must comply with our demands, or suffer the consequences.  Sincerely, A. Terrorist   Prime Minister Blair, who by the way had a firework thrown at him today, has sent her a message expressing his most heartfelt sympathy for the bottle and her.    In other news...  My teacher at school has confessed to reading this blog. I wonder if those mis-spelt comments were from him? He now knows some of my thoughts on life, and I'm not sure if that's a good, or a bad thing :lol: I guess it depends on the thoughts...  While we're on the subject of school, we had another maths test today... not sure how well I did, but I think it was >80% =]  I'm going kayaking tonight! Yay!  I've also discovered that a house that I deliver papers to, has two numbers... And I thought that delivering papers was easy!  I'm off now, got some stuff to do...

      Hiya blog, long time no see! Yesterday's excuse for not posting, was that I had school, after which I had, like, 10 people at my house... and then I was performing a midsummer nights bad dream. After that, I went to a party at a friend's house, which was good, except for the fact that I ended up miles from home with 50p in my pocket and a dead phone battery. Not so good. Party was pretty cool, it was just people in my class. Eppie was due to leave early anyway 'cos she buggered her back up (fell over badly, or something) and as a result of that didn't feel up to sleeping in a bus shelter, or wherever she might otherwise end up sleeping (probably a solid wooden floor, i.e. not good for backs). Anyway, Eppie went at about 12ish. In the end, Adrian went with her *cue wolf-whistles ;-)* because he was "hmm... *yawn* oh fork off, i iz tired innit!" Still not sure what happened to him, I expect he went to sleep at her house.  Everyone else stayed through the night, which is unusual as someone always seems to become rather ill... too much *ahem-teacher-might-be-reading* ribena =) Ruby  almost  had too much, let's just say I ended up virtually carrying her down the road :lol: I'll leave the descriptions of the party there, I don't want to be questioned at school. For once, it was a party where no-one regretted anything, except for maybe too much ribena... maybe we're growing up (what the hell? I like being young and care-free!!) Early this morning me, Martin and Ben set off to Copmanthorpe (where i got stranded) to go to Ben's house. Martin very kindly lent me some money for the bus. Thanks mate! We met some rather scary people, the boys were quite safe, but one of the girls kept trying to find worms to eat, which even I found a touch disturbing. Still quite funny =) Martin and I missed the bus from Copmanthorpe, but the slightly disturbed worm eating girl told us where to get the bus from. ThanQ! I did   eventually   get back to York, with no money, a dead phone which, even if it had been charged, had no credit on it, and I also had wet trousers. And no I didn't wet myself, it was dew. My fault for running through a field at 1AM =). At least I had a used bus ticket, which, curiously enough, smelt of lemon, because a certain company have launched a lemon flavoured version of their chocolate bar and some bright spark had the idea of spraying smelly yellow stuff on the back of the bus ticket as advertising. Anyways, I was standing at the station, sniffing my ticket, wondering how I was going to get back home. In the end I got on this ancient bus only to find that a) it was empty and b) someone I knew drove it, and he let me on for free. Nice one! There then followed a lengthy conversation about whether Glastonbury, or The Download Festival were better. Interesting stuff! At least I thought it was. I then did my paper round with a head-ache and sore legs and feet (I'd been standing ALL day!)  Once I got home I had bbqd dinner, which was nice but tasted a touch of petrol... My step-dad has "original" cooking skills ;) Then I had a bath and  then  I sat down and wrote this!  I'll see you later, blog!  LoZ
