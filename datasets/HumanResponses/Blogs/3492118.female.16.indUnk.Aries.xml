      blah....yeahh..that's how i feel at the moment.  i had to stop taking my asmetha stuff cuz im alergic to it. suprise suprise.  so that makes me feel awful, but ohh well...i'm feeling a wee bit better.  man..i wish i could become unalergic to stuff. that would be great. no more worrying about what food i'm eating or anything like that.  but i guess thats just how i am, and i have to live w/ it.  anywhooo....guess what! the sun is shinning and it's not storming!! YAY!! i'm soo happy.  i was soo tired of those storms and tornatos.  i can't wait to go to alabama.  i really miss all the people down there.  hahaha!! whoo!! it's 18 days till i leave! yay!! ohh! i'm supposed to say hi to jami!! soo..hi jami!! i'm glad u and travis are doing good :)  anywhoo...i think i'm gonna go. stu just brought some ice cream home :D  lol....tootles! *~Jen

      heyy....this thingy is kinda cool.  i can just kinda ramble on about stuff......whoo!! anywhooo....chris (my great friend in utah) gave me the great idea of doing this thing.  also the fact that schools out and i'm bored beyond belief.  i've done nothing all day and it's killing me.  but that's ok, cuz that's what summer is for...right?  whew...i go to alabama in 20 days!! YAY!! i can't wait.  i always have soo much fun. :)  ya know what i realized?? (lol...this is gonna sound strange) everyone has their own little bubble.  and everyone's little bubble holds something differet.  like mine...it holds all my real thougts and feelings.  yeahh...i never let anyone really know how i'm feeling. well...some people, but i guess u could say that those people have figured out how to pop the bubble and have got me talking.  anywhoo...i think i'm gonna go.  ttfn! ta ta for now! *~Jen

      guess what? i'm still sick.  hahaha......it's great. i haven't eaten anything in like 3 days.  ofcourse, i haven't felt like eating anything either.  if ya haven't figured it out already, i kinda react to things like a month later.  like when something happens, it doesn't really hit me till it crosses my mind again, or i find something that reminds me of it.  so yeahh.....i'm sad.  oh! guess what.  jes is on her way home as i type.  haha...yeah. she'll be here around 8:30 tomorrow night.  that's gonna be different.  i haven't seen her in forever...more like 11 months.  but yeahh......i'm gonna get to sleep. i have an orthidontest (wow....i really can't spell) app. at 8:30 in the morning!!!! y in the world would any one be up that eairly anyway?!? lol....yeahh...goodnight everyone.  *~Jen

      camp was great.  it was sooo much fun!!!  we played enough volleyball to last me a life time, and sang so much my voice is dead.  but it was still fun!! :)   katie got baptized this week! i was so happy for her.  it was at 2:30 in the morning....but it was still worth it.  im still saying that all guys are poo.  well...i know that there have to be some that aren't poo.  it's just the ones that are poo have given the ones that aren't poo a bad name.  did that make any since? hope so....but they had the great mud pit again this year.  it made some really great pictures, but it was soo icky.  ohh well.....i'll never get in, so i don't have to worry about it.  but anywhoo.......im gonna go.  i'm bored.....i've been on for almost 2 hours.  tootles!! *~Jen

      well......tomorrow i leave!! yay!! it's gonna be kinda different for me.  i haven't been a counsulor in like 2 or 3 years.  so it shall be wierd.  but what the cool thing is, is that all the little people that i was w/ 2 or 3 years ago are gonna be around the age that i'm gonna be counsuling. hahaha....isn't that wierd.  anywhoo.....it seems like ive already writen in here today, but if i did, oh well....i'm writing again!  the storm we had tonight was very puney.  it was.  it lightning for a while, barly thundered, and i don't think it ever rained.  i have to say, it was boring.  but a bad thing about next week, is that the weather people say it's gonna rain most of the week. that's not coolness.  i hope they're wrong.  i really don't want it to rain.  ya know, i've always wondered if they get paied less if they miss-predict the weather.  or if they get paid more if they predict correct.  hmm....lol.  i think of some pretty odd things sometimes.  but i guess that makes life more intresting.  :D  well...i think i'm going to bed.  i need sleep.  good night!! *~Jen

      goodness.....it was a great day to get burnt.  my sholders and neck got burnt, my eye lids got burnt and one has a blister on it..lol, and only one foot got burnt since i was wearing flip flops.  i don't see how only one foot got burnt though...both were in the sun.  ohh well....it was still cold today though.  i spent most of the morning wraped up in a blanket sitting on the sidelines while everone learned drill.  being in pit u don't have to march, but u get reallllllllly bored.  but that's ok....i get to actually do more stuff next week.  ya know...it takes a long time to fill out the ACT and SAT form thingys.  i figured that out.  theres like 189 questions on the ACT and like 100 on the SAT.  that's quite a lot.  but they're supposdly helping me find what kind of college i would like to be at and what i should major in.  so...whatever.  tonight was a lock-in for the youth group at chuch.  i didn't go becuase im very much dead from lack of sleep this week, and i don't really think that i would be awake enough to be there.  so, i guess i'll go to kendra weekend at camp next weekend.  for all of u who are wondering what kendra weekend is, it's a weekend at camp for kendra.  see, she missed camp for the national latin convention....or somehting like that.  dont' really know....but anywhoo.....she missed camp, and her goal is to cram the entire week into 2 days.  lol....it'll be fun.  i'll get to see camp people again.  but anywhoo...i need my sleep.  goodnight!! :)  *~Jen

      band camp was really stinky today, only because i got sun poisning.  it's really wierd too.  it's only on the back of my knees.  but knowing me and how wierd i am, it'll be on my arms and hands, probably my feet too tomorrow.  gerrr...and i thought MAYBE i wouldn't get burnt very badly either.  anywhoo....this weekend i think the youth group is having a lock in....that should be fun.  ohh!! i'm soo excided!!!  i get to take a tap class at eku!! yay!! it's not like ballet or anything, but w/ my retarted ankle, i don't think i'll ever bealbe to really do ballet.  but tap will be ok.  i'm just worried that the class will be either way too easy, or way too hard.  and it's kinda hard to figure out becuase it's a class on the college level.  so....blah.  it shouldn't be too hard.  but anywhoo.....band camp is bright and eairly tomorrow morning...at 9am.  soo...i need my beauty sleep.  good night!! *~Jen

      lalalalalalalala......band camp starts tomorrow.  wooo!!! can't wait.  i'm so excited i just can't hide it.  lol....no.....i'm happy really...i just don't wnat to get up eairly.  but anywhoo......i had scheduling.  really i do.  see....i have to take driver's ed or my mom won't let me get my license.  and the time that i need to take driver's ed is when i have my honer's engish 3.  and since theres only one class of honer's, i can't change that.  and i need to take the driver's ed in the same period as honer's english because my other half credit to go along w/ driver's ed is socilogy (or how ever u spell it) and i cna't take them during honer's english.  so....i don't know if that made any since, but that's about it.  so....now i'm stuck trying to find another half credit to go along w/ driver's ed that isn't the baby class, or sex ed.  so i'm stuck.  i could always be a redneck and take some ag. class.  but that just might be a wee bit odd just cuz it's so oppsite of me its not even funny.  but anywhooo....enought about school.  for some odd reason i want to go back to camp.  well....its not a bad thing, it's just i never get sleep there.  but that's ok.  it's fun.  and i think we're gonna have kendra weekend!! woo!! that's a weekend for kendra since she missed high school week.  oh!! i saw the village today!!  i really liked it!!  i thought it was gonna be scary, but someone told me it wasn't really that scary, so i wasn't expecting a scary movie. but i was good.  i also watched dirty dancing havana nights.    i liked it.  but i like the first dirty dacning better.  anywhoo....since i have to be up really eairly, i need my sleep.  good night!! *~Jen
