      Wow, I still can't believe the Chinese 'O' Lvls is tomorrow. Haha, I spent the whole day revising Chinese today. Well, honestly, I aim to get an A2. L0L, which is pretty unbelieveable as I've been failing my Chinese. I can't even remember when was the last time I passed it. But the fact is tt I can actually pass it as I managed to get a 48% for the mid-yr exams without studying.  I'm juz wishing for the best and stuffs. I'm juz telling myself tt I can do it and tt Chinese isn't tt tough after all. Haha, I actually look forward to tomorrow's Chinese paper cus I wanna get it over wif and start the June Holidays, which is gonna be a blast! I've basically plan out wad I'll be doing already.  1. Study! 2. Tuition twice a wk, 2hrs each time for A Maths. 3. Make my Geog, SS and FNN notes. 4. Swim at least twice a wk to get darker! 5. Play pool at least twice a wk too juz for the fun of it. 6. Spend quality time wif certain ppl. 7. Go out, relax and chill. 8. Go for a short holiday.  So, tt's basically it. I'll definitely be spending lots of time on the first 4. I'll probably onli go out if I'm extremely bored or if some1 gifs me a ring and ask me out, which I hope happens cus I dun wanna stay at home everi single day! L0L! Well, so if u guys wanna go out or smt, u can always gimme a ring ya? I'll be here for u always! L0L! Alrite, tt's about it for today. Gd luck for tmr's paper to every1 who is taking it. Chill. =]

      Yesterday was a pretty stressful day for me. I had Chinese tuition during the noon time and I continued studying all the way till about 6pm. I'm pretty proud of myself though, cus I dun usually spend tt much time on Chinese. L0L!  I met my Pri Sch fren at 6pm and we went to West Mall. We had dinner at Burger King and did a lot of catching up. We were basically talking about our lives and how it had changed since the last time we met. We spent like half an hour at Burger King juz relaxing and catching up. After tt, we were off to shopping!  First, we went to Giodarno. I got a pair of ankle socks there for $6, which was to my judgement, extremely expensive. Next, we went to Watsons, where I bought a L'Oreal FX Studio hair cream. It cost me $10.30!!! OMG! Well, hair products are always so damn expensive anyway, but there was a 20% discount, if not it would haf been $12.90! We proceeded to Popular next, so tt I could pick up some stationery. I juz bought a stapler and a pen. We went up to Sembangwan Music next to check out on the latest albums and stuffs, but didn't buy anything. We made our way to Bata next, also known as, Buy And Throw Away. I bought a pair of shoes there, which cost me $30.  After we came out of Bata, I realised tt the Giodarno ankle socks was gone. I had no idea if I dropped it or if some1 stole it. *Sighz* So, we went to another shop in West Mall to get ankle socks. The shop sold 1 pair of ankle socks at $1.90, which was so much cheaper. I decided to buy 2 pairs since it was so cheap. Well, like I always say, you win some and you lose some. I lost when I lost the Giodarno ankle socks, but I won when I found a shop tt sold cheaper ankle socks. So it wasn't tt bad after all. L0L! I total up my spendings for the day and it amounted to $61! OMG! L0L! But, it's alrite, even my mum agreed wif me. She said it was alrite cus I onli go shopping like once or twice a yr, so it doesn't realli matter. L0L!  *** Important Update On My Injury *** Yesterday I went to see a doc in the morning. I was realli hoping tt my injury didn't haf anything to do wif my bones. I juz didnt wan any dislocated, fractured or broken shitz. L0L! In the end, the doctor said tt it was juz the muscle, nothing serious, but it would take weeks to recover. But when he was massaging tt part tt hurts, the pain was horrible. Haha, so I realised tt if some1 was to actually squeeze tt part, it would probably hurt like hell. L0L, alrite guys, so all of you noe my conditions now. No worries, but pls try to keep your hands away frm tt painful part ya? Cya! =]

      I knew tt going to school today will be extremely boring. The whole day would juz be chinese, chinese and more chinese! OMG! Fortunately, the last hour would be the cleaning up of our classrooms, so I was saved from chinese. Haha.  Before recess was so boring, I wasn't even paying attention to anything the teacher was saying. When he made us do our own work, I did some, before falling to sleep. Haha, I was tired alrite! The American Idol Finale Results was like up to 12am! But it was worth it to stay up late and watch it. It was juz incredible! Those tt actually missed the show, missed out on 1 of the most extraordinary television programme ever! It was juz amazing, no words left to describe. Haha.  After recess was another teacher who allowed us to revise on our own. But as u all noe, I would probably be slacking and yea I was. The fat pussy cat arrested me and escorted me to the back of the class. L0L! He thinks tt he's my guard! Hmmph! No1 arrests Shawn The Great or treats Shawn The Great like a prisoner! Cus I'm not a Prisoner of War! Grrr! He stole my mobile phone and started to send MMS without my permission! L0L! When I tried stopping him, he used his claws to attack me. Wow, now tt was fierce!  Cleaning the classroom was a joy as compared to having chinese lessons. Haha, time seems to fly real quick and b4 I knew it, it was time to go home! Weee!!!  I had lunch at the hawker centre wif the usual ppl. It was hard to find a place as it was lunch time. The fat pussy cat didn't eat anything, he's probably on a diet or something. L0L! (He's gonna kill me for this, but I'll still say the word: PEACE!)  After lunch, the fat pussy cat forced me to take a cab. Well, I had no other choice! In the cab he made me promise to send some MMS to his email. Again, I had no choice. Well, let's juz put it this way, I do haf a choice, but I'm juz being nice. Haha, I'm juz basically a nice person, so yea dun get misunderstand and think tt I'm afraid of him. Hell no! L0L!  ***Important Update On My Injury*** I'll be seeing the doc tomorrow, so wish me the best of luck and hope nothing bad happens. Alrite den, cya! =]

      "When we first met, I didn't know a thing about u. U started communicating wif me and my life juz seems to haf changed. I became to realise wad I've been missing for the last couple of years, and that is fun. U brought to me joy and happiness. U always tried to get to noe me betta and juz communicate wif me. At first, I didn't know if u were a genuine and sincere sort of person, but I soon realised tt u were. Wow, time realli flies doesn't it? Look where we are at now. Although we might haf onli know each other for 1 or 2 years, it seems tt we haf a lot to talk about. My feelings to u are genuine and sincere too, I juz like u the way u are. There are times when I made sacrifices for u, wif or wifout u knowing. I realli haf no idea about how u feel towards me, but I juz wish tt it's good. I admit tt there are times when I got pissed at u for a thing or 2, but I never took it to heart. U are the reason why I smile every single day, even when I'm down or out. I care a whole lot about u, honestly, more than my veri own sister. I juz hope u do care about me too in one way or another. Although I do not feel tt care and love frm u, deep down in my heart I know tt u do actually care. Do u still remember the time when I got back my terrible results? U were there for me, there to comfort me. There are oso times when u surprised me wif ur strength, concern and so much more. Honestly, I was shocked by all of it, because I didn't think for a single second tt tt was ever gonna happen. I haf no idea how long this relationship of ours will last, but I hope tt it would last while we're still together rite now. I hope tt u won't forget me if we go to separate schools eventually. But whatever the case might be, I want u to know tt u haf become part of me now and tt I'm extremely proud to haf got to know u."  These are my confessions to u*

      Today definitely isn't a good day for me. I'm still in total shock by the amount of disrespect tt some ppl had shown me today. I admit it tt I'm upset, disappointed and a little pissed off too. I mean I can tell the difference between a joke and an insult. Maybe they think tt it's a joke and all tt crap, but there's always a limit. And they haf simply gone over it. I didn't even wanna look at them or be around them after school. It realli makes me feel tt whenever I'm being nice to them, they take a hell lot of advantage of me. They probably wouldn't feel the same way, cus they obviously do not noe wad's like. If onli they could understand and juz spare a tot for me, I'll be delighted. But the way I see it rite now, it's never gonna happen. The insults simply go on and on non stop, they probably didn't even care about how I feel. Tt's wad makes me upset and disappointed, to care for others so damn much and tt they dun even gif a shit bout' me. If this is gonna go on, I'm not gonna gif a shit bout' any relationships anymore damnit. After my 'O' Lvls, I'll juz hope tt I'll never see such ppl ever again. My emotions rite now juz cannot be describe in words. I juz hope tt they would think thru their actions...

      The day began wif our geography results. *Sighz* and I actully tot I did well for it and got at least a B, but to my surprise, I failed. Damn! Well, I guess this is juz life eh? You win some and you lose some. Well, I lost this 1. *Sighz* this is my most disappointing result I've got so far, apart frm English.  Next was E maths, which I was told tt I failed my paper 2. So I wasn't realli expecting much. But when I got it back, I got a 57/100. As for paper 1, I failed by 1 mark, 39/80. So the overall was like 53, which was a C6. I felt pretty lucky to even pass cus I wasn't prepared and my mind wasn't focusing on the 2 papers on tt day, it was somewhere else.  There wasn't PE today, so more slacking juz took place in class during tt period. No work was done or wadsoeva. Haha, this juz proves how slack I am.  Geography was oso slack, cus there was nothing left to do. I was playing wif tt lil'pig who said I was GAY! OMG! Grrr! Hate tt lil' pig! So mean, nasty, hostile, horrible and terrible!  Den 1 period of Chinese was swap for Social Studies, so tt we could get back our results. I passed, but not veri well, got a 32/50. This enabled be to pass my combined humanities juz slightly at a 54%. So, like I said, you win some and you lose some. Words of Shawn The Great once again. Haha.  We had a period of Chinese after Social Studies and an English period. 2 more slack periods as nothing was done. The fat pussy cat was juz sittin in front of me and as usual, doing silly stuffs to me AGAIN! For example, amusing himself wif MY stapler! He not onli wasted a whole row of staples, he even tried stapling my arms and hair. Well, sometimes ppl can realli get dumb and do silly stuffs, especially fat pussy cats! In the end, he destoyed my whole stapler, wad an idiot! Not onli tt, as u all noe he would never stop till he gets turned on. So wad did he do? OMG! He used his right arm to hold me down and used his left hand to grab the most important part of a male. Isn't tt gay? If tt wasn't enough, he continued squeezing it till his satisfactory. OMG! Sometimes, it's extremely hard to noe wad's going on in his head. After he was done, he even gave me tt seductive face once again and the look of satisfaction. Next, he made the Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian, sound like a well, HOE? L0L! He was tryin to sing the song entitled "Angels Brought Me Here". Firstly, it isn't the angels tt brought him here, it's more like the devils! Secondly, he sounded like a cow! Thirdly, He sang wif such a seductive and disgusting look on his face, tt made my hair stood up and sent chill down my spine. As usual, he was giving me his seducive face wif his kuku eyes and smile. As u all noe, I'm a polite person, so I juz had to endure tt suffering and smile back at him, which seemed to haf pleased him a hell lot! L0L! There's also this paper crane, which was given to me by some1's special, in my pencil case. He did the most disgusting thing when he put the poor lil' crane in his mouth! EWWW!!! DISGUSTING is the word! And now not onli the crane stinks, my whole pencil case stinks! Thank god he didn't chew it or did something even more disgusting! Disgusting Gay Fat Pussy Cat!!!  After school, I went wif frens to haf lunch at the hawker centre. After tt we made our way to the West Coast Recreational Centre to play pool. Out of the 4 of us, onli the fat pussy cat was not 16. So when we got there, I wasn't surprised tt the person in charge asked to see all our IC or EZ-link Card? Why? Cus the person probably think tt the fat pussy cat is still in Pri Sch as his height is comparable to tt of a Pri Sch student. In the end, we decided not to play as he would onli be able to watch, which was so unfair. We decided to go to Clementi and watch Troy once again. But we didn't as the next show time was 5:30pm, which is like now? L0L! So all of us made our way home.  Instead of stopping at Bukit Batok Interchange, I went to the Bukit Gombak Interchange to pick up some stuffs on the way back home. I went to see the price of some pairs of shoe. The price range was around $30 - $40, which is considered cheap to me. I intend to get 1 of those soon too. Hehe, den I went to buy some mobile phone's pouch for my frens. I made my way home after tt.  ***Important Update On My Injury*** I'm able to control the pain much betta now. There were ppl who punched and knocked into my rib today, but it wasn't tt bad. So I think it's nearly back to normal rite now. But I think if anybody was to squeeze my ribs, den I'll be a goner. But, I noe tt will never happen as I'll haf a speedy recovery! Haha, alrite den. Cya all! =]

      Pain is how I'm feelin rite now. Nothin but pain and more pain. My abdomen hurts like crazy man. It's been a long time since I've felt such pain. It's worse than any other thing I've suffered frm so far. If I had the opportunity to tap out of this, I would, a million times too. Damn, this is horrible. When I move my body or even juz sneeze, the pain is unbearable! Argh...  This is all cus of the goddamn NAFFA test man. *Sighz*, juz rite after my shuttle run, i fell. Tt was when the pain started to set in. But, I still continued to do sit ups and the standing broad jump as I felt I've already come so far. Doing the standing broad jump was one of the biggest I've ever made in my life. Once I landed, I felt as though my abodmen was ripped apart. It was total hell and I couldn't control the pain any longer.  Although this was a torture, I was finally able to tell who my true frens are and who I'm able to trust. Most of my frens frm 4E3 and 4E4 were concerned about my conditions, and I was honestly touched by this, thanks alot guys! There were realli some pals of mine who were there when I needed them. There was Debbie, who made sure tt I was fully ok before she left frm my side. Now, where can u find such a sweet ger? Then there's Mal, who forced me to take a cab home as I was in pain. There were oso guys like Ze Hao, Gervais, Wei Qiang and Sian Yang who wanted to send me home, but I juz couldn't accept tt wonderful offer. There was oso a teacher who wanted to gif me a lift home, but again, I declined it.  When I got home, the pain didn't subside. It became frm bad to worse and was a torture. I didn't tell my parents and haf not seen a doctor yet. There were some ppl who said they heard a "cracking" sound, which implied a broken bone. I won't noe and I will not wanna noe. Mal, Debbie and Gervais insisted tt I see a doctor, but I refused. Sorry guys, I haf my reasons ya? Eventually, I lied to my parents about it. I told them it was juz aching and tt was why I didn't feel like eating. *Sighz* I juz hope tt the pain will go away by tmr, so tt I can return to school. Once again, thanks to every1 tt were concerned bout' me and asked me how I felt. I realli appreciate it, Thanks! =]

      On the veri first day of the week, it juz had to cum. Nothing else, but the exams results. I was juz so sick of it man, even if I get gd results, it was still the mid-yr exams and not the actual 'O' Lvls. So like *yawnz*...  The first paper juz had to be Chinese! *rolls eyes* Haha, didn't expect a pass at all, but I actually did not bad. My paper 1 was 43.5/70, now it's been a long time since I last got such a gd result for paper 1. My paper 2 was shocking, I didn't expect it to be the lowest, I got a 18/80 ... And because of tt I failed my Chinese by 2 marks. Damn! My oral was 19/30 and listen compre 7/10. So it total up to 48% ... But this juz proves smt to me, and tt is I can actually pass. OMG! Haha.  Den came Physics and Chemistry. For multiple choice, I got a 23/40, disappointing shitz! For Chem practical, I got a 3.5/15, not surprised at all. For the Physics Section B & C, I got a 37, which was actually not bad. As for the Chem Section B & C, I got a 37 too, but this was disappointing as I expected to get higher than Physics. But well it's still alrite I guess. So far, my total mark is 100.5/185, there is juz the Physics practical left, which I noe I'll get below 10, so nvm about it. I mean I still pass rite? ... RITE?  The next paper I got back was English Paper 2. Quite surprising results, I did pretty well. Tt was way above my expectations. Haha, after receiving it, my moral was increased by quite a lot too. Hehe, 47/60.  Well, Food and Nutrition was next. Of all the papers I set for, this was my hopeful one. But the results were simply too shocking. I barely pass, 51/100. I was definitely disappointed, shocked and juz had too much emotions. But I still got a 62.5% wif the addition of my coursework, so I guess it realli wasn't tt bad at all. Haha.  After school, I went to the hawker centre wif a few frens. I felt pretty left out in recent times, noe wad I mean? It's like I'm in a different frequency and stuffs. So, yea, I juz kept quiet most of the time cus it wasn't gonna make a difference if I open my mouth and talk. *Sighz* U won't noe how I realli feel inside ...  Haha, I'm not gonna describe my journey home, cus I dun wanna see some1's harsh actions. Well, I went home and tried to study Chinese, but I guess I was juz too tired and there were juz too many distractions. So, I didn't realli manage to get a lot into my head, but at least I tried. Some1 forced me to cum online juz to d/l songs for him! He even said tt I wrote bad stuffs about him, even though I dun remember writing any bad stuffs about any1. Ppl, u all shld've known by now tt everything I write in here is pure truth! So, pls dun over react to it. L0L, I think tt I'm realli gonna bad real bad tmr. But haf no fear cus I'm the One! Shawno OUT! =]

        I woke up today at 9am, feelin veri restless and sianz. So, i decided to jio someone out to chill and relax. Most of my frens were either going out or were juz out of cash. At 12:30pm, I finally found someone to go out wif! Yay!!! We decided to go to Jurong Entertainment Centre to catch a movie and play pool.   We were supposed to meet at 2:15pm, but as u all noe, most typical Singaporeans are always late. The movie, Troy, was starting at 2:30pm, so both of us were rushing out and stuffs. I reached there at 2:25pm, to my surprise, my fren wasn't there yet. When he reached, it was already 2:40pm, and when we entered the cinema, it was 2:45pm. We missed the first 15mins of the show! OMG! Haha, but it was a 2hr and 43mins film, so the first 15mins wasn't gonna make much of a difference. Overall, Troy was one hell of a bloody show. I still can't understand why it isn't rated as NC16, but it was good. I enjoyed it man although most of the "heroes" died in the end. I'm not gonna say who, cus I dun wan those who haf not watch the movie to noe. I'm not gonna spoil the fun! Hehe.   So after the movie, we went to KFC for dinner. Economical! $5, haha, actually not veri cheap though.   After dinner, we made a trip up to the 3rd storey, where a game of pool was awaiting us. Haha, me and my fren played around 10 games in 2 hours. It was much more expensive during weekends, like $8.80 per hour. But it was too addictive and we juz couldn't stop. Haha, I think both of us won an equal number of games. There was 1 game where I made a stupid mistake. I wanted to use the black 8 ball to hit in a red ball, but in the end, the red ball spin away and the black ball went in, so I juz felt terrible. Compared to last time, I think I've improved more. Haha, yea, so we left at 7:35pm and took a MRT home.   So here I am now writing this entry and waiting for some1 to come online and chat wif me on MSN, cus I realli miss tt person alot! Haha, not gonna tell u who. Cya! =]

        This entry was meant to be for yesterday, but I didn't haf the energy to write it. Haha, I came home like close to 1am?   The day started wif one and a half hours of Chinese tuition. *Sigh* haha, den my Maths & Science tutor was supposed to come, but he fell sick and couldn't. So, I was slacking and basically doing nothing.   Den in the afternoon, after my lunch, I went to earn some money. Yea! The gambling way. Haha, I was there till like 12:00am+, nearly the whole day. And I did earn some money, not alot though. So I guess I'll be giving somebody a treat today? Hehe, I wonder who would be tt special someone.   L0L, this is my shortest blog entry so far man, from the longest to the shortest. It juz realli wasn't much happening yesterday, didn't receive any disturbing phone calls. Haha, alrite I guess I'll stop here, I'll be back later to write today's entry. Cya around~ =]

        Haha, ok Biwen, I'll take u're advice and start to haf paragraphs for my blog. L0L!   Alrite, so my day started out once again wif waking up early in the morning to take tt stupid Chinese oral thing. By now all of u ppl shld haf already known tt I hate waking up early in the morning. Haha, anyway, the Chinese oral went pretty alrite I suppose, dun think that I'll fail it, but who knows. I can't be bothered anyway, cus wad counts is still the 'O' Lvls, so even if I get straight A1s now, i would not be happy. Even if I get straight A1s now, there's no use cus I might end up not doing well in my 'O' Lvls. So for me rite now it's juz to learn frm all my mistakes even if I failed every single paper. I won't be surprised if I actually do, cus I haven realli been revising for my mid-yr exams, haha, I'm a slacker man!   After the Chinese oral, I headed straight home to take a shower and change. Den i went down to Orchard Road at bout' 1pm to meet a fren of mine. We walked around Paragon and The Herren for an hour first, before heading to Cineleisure for lunch. We met wif two other of my frens and had lunch at Subway, which was realli expensive. It's a fast food restaurant, but their meals are like $6 and above, which is totally unecomical. A meal consist of a sandwich, a packet of chips and a drink. The sandwich was 6 inches long, the packet of chips were those small in size wif the packet onli half full and the drink was normal size. I think the price it's realli too high, they shldn't charge so much seriously. The taste of the sandwich is juz alrite, not all tt superb after all.   After lunch, we went up to the cinema to buy tickets for Shrek 2. We were supposed to watch it at the 3:30pm time slot, but there were onli tickets left for the front row and single seats. My frens didn't wan to seat at the front row or separately, so they bought tickets for the next time slot, which was 5:05pm. So, we basically had one and a half hours to do something else. We walked around Cineleisure first, den we decided to head to The Herren once again (OMG!), haha.   On the way there, i pop into Starbucks and got a Ice Blended Mocha. Boy did tt taste good man! I juz love those Ice Blended Mocha, it's probably my favourite drink too. So when we got to The Herren, we went into HMV to look at some stuffs, which was kindda boring. Not tt I dun like music or anything, but well, today juz wasn't the day for music. Haha, so I went wif one fren to look around at other shops. We went mostly to clothes shops and I saw quite a few things tt I would return to buy during the June Holidays, as I didn't haf enough money to buy them at tt time. Haha, we returned back to Cineleisure at around 4:50pm and entered the cinema to watch tt movie.   Honestly, at first, I didn't like the idea of watching Shrek 2. It juz wasn't the kindda movie I would watch. But hey, I was realli glad I watched it cus it's a damn funny show man. There was one part of the show where I laughed till my leg had a muscle cramp and I was like ouch the next moment. I will definitely recommand this show to any1 man, it's hilarious! I won't mind watching it again too. Haha, the show was one and a half hours, so it ended like 6:35pm.   We went out of Cineleisure and two of my frens decided to go home, as they didn't think there was anything else to do. So it was juz me and this other fren. (the one who I met in the first place) Both of us didn't feel like going home tt early, so we were juz aimlessly walkin around Orchard Road. We walked around shopping malls too and even went into those high class shops, which sold a tie for $170 and a shirt for $930. L0L! Insane stuffs I tell u man. We were done like around 9:30pm and decided to return home at last. Haha, it was a long day for me and I was tired too.   I reached home at around 10:30pm. I took a quick shower and caught the last 15mins of The Bachelor. Den I came here to type the entry for today! Hehe, it was like 11:00pm since I started typing and it's nearly close to an hour cus I was kindda interrupted when I was mid way thru. Let me tell u why...   At 11:18pm sharp as my mobile phone read, I received a call frm who? A fat pussy cat! OMG! As u all noe I'm a polite person who won't reject calls, so I answered the call, thinking tt the stupid fat pussy cat would asked me some decent questions. I regretted answering the call man! OMG! It was like so late in the nite and he juz had to do it. I was in total shock! The first thing I heard when I answered the call was none other than a seducive voice! (obviously tryin to turn me on) I was like OMG!!! But as u all noe, I'm a decent guy and won't realli get turned on juz by a voice, so I politely said hi. When the fat pussy cat on the other end knew tt I wasn't turned on, he used a ger to try to make me get into the mood. Unfortunately, I knew it was a prank and didn't fall for it. So his onli hope was to say wad he realli wan! U won't believe this man, I couldn't either! He wanted to haf phone sex wif me!!! OMG!!! Firstly, I'm not gay!

      As u all noe, today was a slack day for me. I had to wake up early in the morning to go to school for exams! *sigh* I was pretty tired after watching yesterday's American Idol, I wonder who will be out today though. Anyway, my first paper, which was A Maths, lasted for 2 whole hours! Is tt sick or wad man? I mean, I was like done even before an hour. Why? Cus out of 12 questions, I onli completed 1, which was like 5 marks. L0L! But hey, I still tried my best doing the rest. The next paper was a real quick one, juz an hour. It was my science MCQ paper, which was i would say pretty alrite. The Physics part was kindda tough, but the Chemistry was still ok. I had like 20 out of 40 questions which I was uncertain about. But, well, wad can I do? So heck wif it since it's over, like finally. Phew~! And tt was my last paper for the mid-yr! Yea! I can finally get back to my slacking mode again. Haha, but they juz have to put the stupid Chinese Oral thing tmr! Tt juz freaking piss me off as it's suppose to be an off-day, a day which I can sleep at home till the noon time! Grrr! And like we're suppose to report at 08:55pm and I'm pretty sure we will be done within an hour or so. Tt, I feel is a total waste of time man! Going to school for juz an hour? The school doesn't haf the brains to organise a stupid Chinese Oral during school days! And furthermore, it's Chinese! OMG! But u noe wad? U might haf guessed it, I dun care. Haha. Anyway, after my exams today, i went to play pool wif a couple of frens at the West Coast Recreation Centre. It was my first time and it was pretty cool. Well, at least i managed to shoot some balls in. Haha, it was real fun, I even took pictures of myself aiming the balls. L0L! Anyway, the mid-yr exams are finally over, but the 'O' Lvl Chinese Examinations are coming! But as u all shld noe by now, heck wif it! I'm a full time slacker man, tt's my job! L0L. I haf started planning wad i would be doing the June Holidays. First of all, tuition for A Maths twice a week! I've got to buck up and stop slacking already, L0L! Secondly, swimming twice a week at least too. I've got to train this weak body of mine man before it rots! And Hell No, I'm not gonna let any1 call me white stick or stuffs again! Thirdly, I wanna go play pool as often as I can too, juz for the sake of it and the fun of it. Hehe, I might also be going overseas as well for about a week. I'm not sure where I'll be going yet, might be South Korea, Japan or Kuala Lumpur. I'm juz trill to go to other countries! Finally, on the 22nd of June, when Linkin Park comes to Singapore, I'll be there man! Someway or somehow I'll be watching them perform! Yea, now tt's something to talk about! Well u noe wad i guess tt's bout' my plans. I juz hope my frens or whoever ask me out during the June Holidays often to do something, or else I'll probably be at home doing nothing. And a typical person like me will never ask anyone to go out unless I'm realli dying of boredom. Oh yes, I also haf to go to Coffee Bean and Starbucks! And I'll probably go there wif my primary school fren juz to chill, chat and catch up wif him. Den again, I juz remembered tt there's a new soccer court near my house, so I guess I'll be visiting quite often to kick some balls! I juz remembered something else, I need to update my website during the June Holidays as well as make some cartoons to put them up, so please check out my website ya? Okok, I think I'll stop here for today, chill and peace out guys! =]

      Wow, I've finally created my own blog! I'm so proud of myself! =P So, let's see wad I can do here, hehe. "People might think whatever they want about themselves, but wad others think of them might be different from wad they think." And that is actually wad I said to some today. Haha, words of Shawn The Great once again! Hehe, so I've finally find the time to create this blog thing. Why? Cus the mid-yr exams are nearly over! Yeah! It's a slack day for me today, although I still haf my a maths and combined science paper tomorrow, but well heck about a maths. As for combined science, it's juz MCQ and not short questions or essay questions. And I kindda studied for it already, so... Yea I'm free! Hehe, but I might consider to study for it later in the night or something. But den again, it's American Idol night! How can I possibly miss that show? So Hmmm, I guess I'll juz haf to prioritize. Today was pretty much a slack day too. Exams exams exams... *sigh* BORING! But it went pretty well (shockingly), English was pretty easy and as for as Food & Nutrition, I think I can pass. If I dun pass, I can go jump off the building man! Cus I know tt it wasn't too bad and I can't possibly fail. Why? Cus I think tt was the best FNN test that I've taken so far. Hehe, well, after the exams I went to eat at the hawker centre opposite of my school wif a couple of frens. We were basically slacking and talking nonsense, I didn't realli haf much to say though. I took a cab home wif the pussy cat, who was suppose to pay for the cab fee! But as u all noe, tt never happens, so poor me had to pay for the cab fee wif my limited amount of money. Stupid fat pussy cat! Hehe, well I guess tt's it, juz tryin this thing out so Yea, tt's bout' it! Oh yea, do me a favour by taggin my blog ya? Ok! Cya around~ =]

      The day started off wif Food & Nutrition, which was boring as we couldn't go to the com lab. We had to stay in tt F&N room and do our evaluation, which has to be handed in by Fri. It has to be like 2pgs long. I seriously can't think of so much shitz to write. Time passed real quick and 2 periods were gone juz liddat. Poor lil' pig and fat pussy cat had to go for their B.B. L0L! Fat pussy cat made me surrender my packet of sweets b4 leaving too! So mean of him to do tt. L0L! Greedy lil' !@#$%^&  Mid way thru the day, there was something realli happening. Someone said this to me "The more I look at u, the cuter I think u r." Wahahaha, veri touched man. Hmmm, suddenly I'm feelin like a bachelor man. I like 4 gers at a time. L0L! Out of the 4 of them, I onli told 2 of them b4. I didn't realli get an answer frm 1, the other 1 said maybe after the 'O's. Hopefully, she'll remember me. I dunnoe if I shld ask the other 2, but if I do, it won't be rite now. It will probably be after the 'o' lvls.  During A Maths lesson, my teacher delievered some news to us. He said those tt got below 35 for the mid-yr will no longer stay in the cls anymore. We're going to be taught by another teacher in the Maths Rm. How wonderful man, now I hafta do my A Maths homework. *sighz*  After school, I skipped focus and went for lunch wif Ze Hao. I was too tired to study any further. After eating we went to 7-11 and slack. I bought a copy of 8 days and there were a hell lot of shitz in there man, damn interesting. L0L! We slack and talk rubbish till around 3:45pm. L0L! When I got home, I took a shower and continue reading the magazine. When I finished reading it, my eyes were closing and b4 I knew it, I was asleep. This is my new wishlist, hopefully some angels will get be 1 of the following. Some1 already agreed to get me the first, so I'll juz hafta wait for it. Hehe. And those tt nvr buy anything for my b'dae, !@#$%^&, u noe wad to do!  Shawny's Wish List: 1. Lost Prophets album 2. Kenny G's Greatest hits album 3. Busted(A Present For Everyone) album 4. Levi's Jeans 5. Something Special!  Alrite, I shall end here for today ppl. Cya ltr~~~ =]

      School was boring as usual. Mrs Peggy Koh is now my E Maths teacher. Well so far I dun realli haf anything to comment bout' her. I guess she's pretty alrite. The gd thing was tt during her lesson, there was like total silence. Nobody was talking at all. Not even the lil' pig or the fat pussy cat. L0L! Sucha peaceful environment tt I can concentrate in. Hehe, hope tt it will remain like tt till the 'o' lvls. Tt will definitely be pretty cool. Garyson sat behind me and I turned around sometimes juz to talk when I'm realli bored. Fat pussy cat was juz beside me and was being irritating as usual. I was like whispering to Garyson and nobody could hear wad we were talking at all, but he juz had to ask me to keep quiet and pay attention. In the first place, he's the one not paying attention. Wad a moron! L0L!  After E Maths, the gay fat pussy cat was doing stupid stuffs as usual. He was using his weak arm to strangle me and bring me to the ground. *Yawnz* Well, at least tt wasn't on a sofa or a bed. The ground is so much more spacious compared to a sofa or a bed. On the ground I haf more space to move. On the sofa or the bed, I'll probably be nailed down by his fat body! L0L! But he's still a short, ugly, disgusting, weak, gay, fat pussy cat! L0L! 6 simple vocab words juz to describe him! L0L! Wait, maybe I missed some other words. L0L! Nah, I can't be bothered to go on describing a fat pussy cat. Peace lil bro! L0L!  The rest of the day was plain boring. Haha, I need something special to keep myself entertained. Nowadays, it seems like I get bored easily and it takes alot to make my lively and kicking again. L0L! Well, I think I won't be able to get tt entertainment frm school, probably not. Unless there's like something or someone tt can keep me realli entertained.  After school, I saw Anwar. We went for lunch than played pool for about one and a half hrs. Man, I realli gotta save cash for the rest of the wk if I intend to go out on Sat wif Hongyue. We'll probably catch a movie first or smt cuz the 'o' lvls listening ends at like 10:30am and the stuff tt she wanna see is in the late afternoon, around 2pm. Yup, so we might juz go walk around or smt. Hmmm, but nothing's confirm till tt veri day. L0L! I'm always like a last min person nowadays, confirming things at the veri last min onli. Well, let's juz hope tt the movie won't be a chinese 1 juz like The Best Bet. -.=" *sighz*. Oh! Apparently there were unhappy ppl after they found out I went to watch The Best Bet wif some other of my frens when I told them I would nvr watch tt sh!tz film. L0L! I'm like so dead now, haha, but who cares anyway. It wasn't my fault! L0L!  I suddenly haf a phobia of bearhugs. Haha, dunnoe why, but juz feel odd bout' it. Alrite, I'll stop crapping here and try to get the phobia away soon. L0L! Cya yall~ =]

      I woke up today and the first thing on my mind was to get the results of the match between Czech Republic and Denmark. I got my cards rite this time and Czech defeated Denmark 3-0. My father got the results from CNA half an hr after I woke up. L0L! But it was betta than nothing. I set off to school again after a month of Holidays.  Assembly was boring, a hell lot of talk. But some1 was trying his best to distract me, who else but tt Fat Pussy Cat ! L0L! Wad an idiot! He kept calling my name and when I look at him, he turned away. Now tt's wad I call a gay act! L0L! Let's juz hope tt he doesn't see this. Wahahaha. Anyway the day was pretty boring and I was pretty tired, I dun even noe why too. L0L! During my Food & Nutrition period, Hongyue was asking me to go to the National Stadium this Sat, cuz of some1 in B.B!? (definitely not those in my cls, pls dun get the wrong idea, her taste isn't tt BAD!) But still, my god! L0L! I said "Go for wad? Who wanna see these 2 lj face!?" (pointing at the fat pussy cat and the lil' pig) L0L! Tt was kindda mean of me, but still Hehehe. Lil' pig was pretty insulted by it and had a hell lot of reaction. The fat pussy cat on the other hand, kept quiet cuz he knew tt was basically the truth. L0L!   I realised during F&N period tt lil' pig veri poor thing, not enough money. *sobz* *sobz* Since I'm sucha wonderful caring & loving brother unlike SOME ppl, I decided to gif him a treat. L0L! He became happy in sucha flash. L0L! Haha, and wad do u noe, the fat pussy cat was there and he wanted a treat too! Sucha greedy lil' !@#$%^& L0L! Dun care him! He is so damn rich and shld be the one who treat me. Wahahaha, he always claim tt I'm mean and unfair when it's actually him. L0L! Well, nvm, I can't be bothered bout' him. L0L!  I had to stay back after school to complete some work given to me for an English workshop the nxt 6wks or so. Hongyue and I were in class tryin to do the compre, but we juz couldn't concentrate. We decided to tell Ms Tang tt we decided not to go for tt thing. We told her, but changed our minds in the end. So we juz had to shuddup, suffer and do it. Nike~ Juz Do It~! After tt, we decided to haf a meal, but the hawker centre was closed! L0L! We decided to grab some stuffs frm 7-11 and ate them at the hawker centre. Well, tt wasn't enough, the portion was so miserable. Hongyue didn't like wad she got too, so we went to the bakery~ L0L! We got some buns frm there and ate along the way to the bus stop. My bus came first, but I chose not to board it in order to spend some quality time wif her. Haha, but her bus came like 3mins after my bus left, so it was kindda ... -.=" Haha, well at least the time we spent together today was worth it.  I realised tt spending time wif the ones u care and tresure bout' is realli important. It's rare tt both of us spend time together, but I'm glad we did today. I noe there are others who I hafta spend more time wif, but it's like so hard to do so. In order to spend quality time wif some1, I think tt it's juz hafta be u and tt person. Nobody else shld be there. Tt's how I feel bout' wad spending quality time wif some1 is. Wad do u think huh? I'll leave ya wif tt thought. Till tmr, Cya~! Shawn Out! =]

      *Sighz* Well, today's the last day of the holidays, which is juz... *Sighz* It's juz so damn fast man. Everything's gonna sux tmr, seeing certain ppl again who I haven't seen for a month. Now tt juz suxs. L0L! Well, so it's juz gonna be realli boring and stuffs. Going to school is always a 2 way thing, gd and bad. But rite now, I juz see it as a pretty bad thing. Haha, hopefully it won't sux as much as I think it would.  Well, not much activities the past few days. I dunnoe why I dun haf the energy to do anything for the past few days. I'm like juz slacking all the time. Either sleeping, watching euro, playing the com or eating. Yea, tt's bout' it. L0L! I'm juz too damn lazy to do anything. This juz shows how "ready" I am for sch tmr. *Sighz* I've gotta start saving up more money now. I still hafta watch Spider man 2 wif a fren and buy presents for certain ppl. Man, I juz hope tt I haf tt kindda cash now. Money always seem to be sucha issue in every teenager. L0L!  Watching Euro 04 for the past few days has not been pleasing at all! I'm supposed to earn cash and not lose it. I've lost in 2 matches in 2 consecutive days, like at least $20 gone? Man does tt sux! I juz hafta hope tt Czech Republic defeats Denmark tmr morning. They juz haf to rite now, if not I'll be losing 3 matches in 3 consecutive days! Damn! Hell No! I ain't losing! So Czech, u guys noe wad to do rite? Good!  I can already see tt tmr's gonna be a damn tiring day. I'll probably rush home after sch to slp if there isn't any shitz to do. Man, I juz remembered. I still hafta wake up early to comb my hair! Oh Man! *Sighz* I juz hope I won't be late although I've got a feeling tt I will. L0L! But I guess I'll hafta wake up on time and not waste precious time. And I hope when I switch on the tv to Chan 21 tmr, I'll see tt Czech Republic defeated Denmark wif ease. Alrite alrite, enough crapping ok!? L0L! Cya around~! =]

      Woah, I woke up at 4am today to find out the results of the match between England and Portugal. At tt time, the score was 1-0 to England. I was hoping Portugal equalise as my bet was on them to win. It was a rather exciting match, and at the 83rd min, the 2 subsitutes for Portugal made managed to craft out a goal. Simao crossed in the ball to Postiga, who headed home the equaliser. Sol Campbell from England actually scored a late winner in the 90th min, but the goal was disallowed due to a foul.   The match went to extra time with tt silver goal rule. Rui Costa from Portugal managed to score a goal 5mins into the second half of extra time. Portugal thought tt was gonna be the winner and so did England's Coach, Sven Goran Eriksson. With 5mins remaining, England equalise thru Frank Lampard.   This led the match to penalties. England was first wif David Beckham. I knew tt he was gonna miss it rite frm the veri moment he stepped up and he did. In Euro 2004, he missed 2 penalities, which caused his team to lose. The first miss was against France. Rui Costa also missed the penalty for Portugal. Vassell's penalty was saved by Ricardo, who also took Portugal's last penalty and send them thru to the semi-finals. Tt was a realli thrilling match and the results were pleasing too. L0L!  I slept after the match till like 1pm. I woke up for lunch and did my fnn coursework till like 4pm. I met Benson around 5pm and we went to Bugis Junction to get his b'dae present. L0L! Man was tt costly! Half of my savings were basically gone after buying him tt! L0L! Well, but seriously all my savings will be gone in no time as I still owe some ppl their b'dae presents. L0L! We walked around and had dinner b4 going home. On the MRT home, we were deciding if we shld go for a game of pool. I decided not to in the end as I was too tired to do so.   Anyway, for those ppl who I've not gotten presents for yet, hehe, pls be patient. I'll look into it, seriously I will. I decided to get Benson's b'dae present first cuz it was the cheapest compared to the rest! L0L! Honestly, his b'dae present is the most expensive present I've bought for anyone yet. -.= But nvm bout' tt cuz others are demanding more frm me! L0L! But I'll see into it ya? Juz gimme some time ok? Alrite den, cya around guys~! =]

      These are some quiz I took to basically try to understand myself betta...  How Fat Are You?   You're anarexic. That's weird but it's much better than being fat. reconsider your eating habits but make sure that if you start eating again you DONT get fat. I suggest that maybe you go and get some special help and get yourself worked out before you start eating or continue not eating because you may have some serious problem. Anyway, make sure you eat something because your body needs some nutrients! Thanks for taking my quiz and for finding out that you are anarexic!  ---> Now I think tt's totally untrue! I'm not even skinny! I'm juz thin dammit!  The Big Love Test   LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.  ---> Hmmm, now tt sounds true. Seriously, it does. Dun u agree wif me?  What Movie Do You Belong In?   Power Rangers Movie!  ---> Well, I've to admit tt I pretty much agree wif this. *Sighz*  Which Kind of Candy Are You?   You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.  ---> Maybe this is true. I do find it hard trusting others at times. I juz can't find someone tt I can express my feelings to yet.

      I was supposed to haf tuition today at 11am. Juz like yesterday, my tuition teacher rang up and said tt he couldn't make it, so I continued sleeping till like 1pm. L0L! I woke up and had lunch. I was supposed to pass to lil' piggy his fnn's stuffs today, but he didn't inform me of the changes, so I juz waited till like 2:30pm. I smsed him first, but after 15mins when there was no reply, I gave him a call. Ce Rong answered the phone and said lil' pig was bz ordering smt. He said they were at Jurong Point and I was like ok . . . . . . ? He told me not to wait for tt lil' pig cuz he probably won't be collecting it frm me today. 10mins later, I received an sms frm lil' pig and well tt's bout' exactly wad he said.  Yea, wad a great way to start the day huh? I missed an appointment juz to stay home and wait for his reply, and wad happens? Haha, wad a joke man. I decided to get my hair cut since I had already missed my appointment to go out. I felt realli gd after getting my hair cut realli short, it seems to remove the sorrows tt I've been hafing for the past 2 days. And if tt wasn't enough? Pool was! Haha, I met anwar in the evening to thrash my anger out. Not on him, but on the balls. I imagined tt the balls were ppl I hated and juz whacked them realli hard. It realli worked, I managed to perform betta than usual too. L0L!  Well, I'm basically listening to music now, thinking and at the same time bloggin. Music realli seems to calm me down in one way or another. I'm juz thinking to myself rite now bout how I feel. Although they might not treat me well or treat me as a bro or wadeva, I dun care. I juz haf a personality to treat ppl well, even if they dun. It sucks, yes, definitely, but wad can I do. Yes, I definitely think tt I'm the one at lost, but den again, it was be tt acknowledged them, so I hafta live wif it. I always look at the gd side of ppl rather than the bad. So, I'll juz think bout' happy memories I haf wif them rather than any bad stuffs. Well tt's bout it I guess, cya! =]

      Now I noe wad it means by the truth can hurt u. I reached home like 11pm when I actually could be earlier. I walked all the way frm Bukit Batok Interchange back home thinking, nothing else but think. I stopped at a bus stop juz to think bout' my life. I realised something tt I haf not realise for over a year. Tt is my life has pretty much been ruined when I went to upper sec. In pri sch, it was horrible too. I was an outcast, except for a few frens. There were ppl making fun of me, calling me names and stuffs. But tt was den, when we were still childish and immature. In lower sec, I wasn't gonna let ppl make fun of me or took advantage of me, nobody did. The onli problem was tt I had a realli serious attitude problem. In upper sec, everything doesn't seem to go rite. Everything's juz wrong...  I'm juz so shocked, I simply do not noe how to describe how I feel rite now. I'm juz like emotionally broken down. When I actually thought tt I'm close wif some1, turns out tt I dunnoe much bout' them. I thought at had a gd relationships wif certain ppl, but it turns out tt I'm wrong, totally. I dun even noe the basic stuffs, it's disappointing to trust some1 this much, but u dun get it in return.  "r we considered close in ur opinion" "u decide"  Yea, I definitely noe why now. It's simply fucked up man. Questions arouse about how well I treat some ppl, well I think they shld be asking themselves tt question. How well did they actually treat me? Did they actually care for me even as a fren, tt's the minimum, I'm not even talking about more than frens. They said they treated me well when they treated me like dirt. I've nothing left to say if they feel tt treating me like dirt is treating me well. I do not noe how on earth one can question me bout' how well I treat him or her when I treat tt person like my veri own sibling. Tt juz hurts me alot, a hell lot. If tt is how he or she feels, den I realli think I made a mistake knowing tt person. It's painful to even type this out.  I've always kept my emotions inside of me, whenever I'm depressed. But I can't do tt anymore. I need someone there for me, someone who will stand by me and juz talk to me. But I can't seem to find tt person. There's one who realli noes me well, but tt's juz isn't the rite person I can turn too, furthermore, we're the same age. There's another, who's a girl, but she already has many problems to deal wif, I dun wanna be a burden to her. I juz hope I find this person soon, like a gurdian angel or smt, who will always be there for me when I'm in need.  I've always thought that ppl I feel close wif are actually close to me. Last yr I was close wif this 1 guy, turns out tt he's a backstabber. I tried to keep my distance frm him frm den onwards, but didn't tell others bout' his behaviour. I'll always try not to be around him unless unfortunately somebody I'm going out wif calls him along and tt will totally sux cuz I can't even bear to look at him. I realli hope none of this will happen again cuz it realli hurts.  On the surface, I may seem pretty fine all the time, but in actual fact, deep down inside of me, I'm not at all fine. Ppl juz dun see it, they dun see how fucking shitz I feel deep inside of me. Tt sucks, it realli does. And wad do they do? They continue making fun of me and callin me nicknames wifout knowing their limit like there's no end. Wad do I do? I smile, make fun of them back and other silly stuffs. How do I actually feel? Horrible, Disappointed, Dejected and juz Fucked up. It realli does sucks to see ppl going on when they do not noe how I realli feel. Wad do they say? Kidding onli wad, joking onli wad, so serious for wad, go out onli wanna be so serious, BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH! Wad do I feel like telling them? Shuddup and Fuck off. Wad do I actually say? Yea, ok sorry, my bad, maybe I take stuffs too seriously? Wad do I think? There's a time to joke and a time to be serious, dun go over the limit.  I dunnoe how to describe how I feel rite now, I juz think tt I shld keep a distance away frm certain ppl, allow time to pass and hopefully forget. After my 'O' lvls and when we are separate to different schs, I juz hope tt I won't meet such ppl again in which ever poly tt I go to. Whether I'll stay in contact wif anyone frm sec sch? I think the answer is obvious. I won't go on any further cuz it's juz too painful to continue and I realli think tt some ppl are realli gonna get hurt if I do.    borderline    urlLink   Which Personality Disorder Do You Have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    This was a quiz I took, but I think tt's not how I am.

      I created a quiz juz yesterday. This quiz were basically questions about myself. I wanted to see how much my frens actually do noe about me. I wasn't shocked by the results as I noe most ppl dun actually noe much about me. So far, out of 22 ppl who haf taken the quiz, onli 8 of them passed. L0L! Some results proved to be realli surprising. Haha, so let's look into it. We'll start frm the bottom.  I seriously didn't expect any1 to get 0, but maybe my questions were realli too personal. L0L. There were 2 tt got 10, 1 of them is Benson, who I feel like smacking! I've been in the same cls wif him for the second yr and he doesn't noe me!!! Grrr! L0L! I wasn't shocked tt 3 ladies got 20 cus honestly, they do not noe much bout' me, so it wasn't disappointing. 5 ppl got 30 and nope, wasn't shocking either cuz they didn't noe much about me too. I was disappointed wif 2 out of 3 ppl who obtained 40. I felt tt they knew me pretty well compared to others and the minimum they shld haf got was 50, but it's ok, sometimes things liddat happen. No worries ya?  Now for those who passed the quiz. L0L! There were 4 ppl who got 50. It was pretty surprising to see who were the ones tt got 50 cuz I wasn't expecting any of these 4 ppl to get 50. There were 2 tt got 60 and I'm pretty happy wif them. L0L! I didn't realli expect them to get tt high cuz I always thought of them as those kind of "heck care" ppl. L0L! Only 1 got 70, tt was the most surprising result of all as I didn't expect tt person to get sucha high mark although he knew me pretty well. L0L! There were no 80s or 90s, but some1 someway and somehow managed to get a 100! OMG! Well, surprised? Yea, a lil' bit. Expected? Well, I kindda hope so. Happy? Definitely I was. L0L! And who on earth would actually get full marks for it? Some1 u least expected it to be! L0L! Maybe not. Some1(Anonymous) managed to guess who it was.  Anonymous: wOhhhxx..hux unbelievable..100 percent nehhxx..really unbelievable woRHhxx.. Anonymous: lemme guess _______ baRhhxx? Me: how u noe? Anonymous: hEHhxx..im envious wohhxx..u two've got a great friendship there..hEHhxx.. Me: haha i hope so Anonymous: hope so?.. smthx wrng aRHx? Me: no la i mean well afterall it's onli a quiz mah Anonymous: haRHhaxx..tink of it diz wae..itx only a quiz but i got 20 only nEhhxx while he got everyting right..hEhhxx.. Me: Haha ok  Hmmm, I thought about wad tt person said and well yea, it's kindda true. I mean it's not easy to find some1 tt knows so much about u rite? So I'm pretty glad about it. Well, I guess I'll stop here for today. I'll provide more results when others take the quiz ya? Alrite den, cya~! =]

      I woke up today pretty early for tuition at 11pm. I was realli tired and exhausted, but I dun even noe why. Haha, but I still managed to concentrate during tt 1 and a half hours of tuition, so it wasn't tt bad.  I went out wif my family during the evening to Peninsular Shopping Centre. There was this shop tt sold a pair of Adidas shoes tt I realli like. It was actually $110+, but it was on sale at $79.95, so I decided to get it as I've been eyeing on it for quite some time already. The main colour is black and the stripes are in white. It looks pretty good to me. Hehe.  We went to Funan Centre next. My dad bought me a Sony Cybershot 4.1 Megapixels Digital Camera!!! OMG! L0L! Since all Sony digi cams were on offer now, I managed to convince my dad to get me 1. At first I juz wanted the 1 tt cost $399, but my dad figured out tt the $549 was cheaper in certain ways, so he got tt for me! Isn't tt great? Haha, I managed to lower the price down to $515! Tt's even betta! L0L! The digi cams were already on promotion, but the salesman still managed to lower down the price. How nice of him! L0L! Well, the shop was "Song Brothers" on the 2nd storey of Funan Centre.  After tt, we went to meet our relatives at this restaurant in the Esplanade. The food was damn expensive and the quality of it is onli so-so and not worth tt much. Also, the portion served was miserable. Tt was how I felt. We went down to a cafe later juz to relax and chat. We chat till like about 10pm b4 proceeding home.  We reached home like 11pm. I took a quick shower and went to create a quiz on the net. This quiz is basically about how much u guys truly noe me, so pls visit it and gif it a shot. After doing it, u guys will noe how much u all actually noe about me. The webbie is http://www01.quizyourfriends.com/takequiz.php?quizname=040619121752-b0inkx&c=0&a=08 . I watched the match between Germany and Latvia, which ended up in a 0 - 0 draw! OMG! Tt was realli shitty! The next match is Czech Republic vs Holland and my bet is on Czech. They hafta win or else I'll lose another $10! L0L! Alrite, I'll stop here. Cya~! =]

      Well, I never intend to watch this show at all. Firstly because it's a Chinese film and secondly because it's a Singapore production. L0L! But in the end due to certain reasons, I had no choice but to watch it. L0L! Some time ago, there were some frens of mine who invited me to watch this movie too, but I said there was not a chance tt I'll watch it. L0L! I actually did in the end and they'll probably screw me if they see this account. But I'm not afraid of them, there won't be any consequences or wadsoeva. L0L! Although I must admit tt I'm kindda guilty, but let's juz hope tt they won't get pissed over it ya? Hehe.  So I woke up kindda early today and met my lower sec frens and sec 1 maths teacher, Mr Ivan Lee, at 12 noon in Cineleisure. I was kindda late as I had a hard time waking up. L0L! But I still made it in time for the movie. It was pretty tough to understand, but at least there were English subtitles to help me. Overall, it's juz an okok movie I supposed. I'm never gonna say tt a Singapore production in Chinese is wonderful, superb or great in anyway. L0L! Well, but this was the second Chinese movie I actually watched.  The movie ended at 3pm and we crossed over to The Heeren for lunch/dinner at Sakae Sushi. It was the buffet kindda style, but it cost like $16/++. Mr Ivan Lee is realli good man, he treated us for both the movie and lunch/dinner. After lunch/dinner, it was like 5:30pm if I'm not wrong. We walked around The Heeren and I bought the pouch I wanted frm 77th Street! Yay! L0L! It cost me $18, which was kindda expensive.  After walking around The Heeren, we made our way to Plaza Singapura and walked around there too. We went up to the Kopitiam for some drinks and desserts. After tt, Mr Ivan Lee took his leave as he had to return to his school tmr to clear out some stuffs. My frens and I made our way down to Clementi to play pool. We played for an hour plus and went for supper after tt at the Kopitiam nearby. We left for home at about 10pm and I managed to reach home to half an hour's time. Pretty faster than usual! L0L!  Well, the match between England and Switzerland is kicking off soon and I'm not going to miss it, so I guess I'll juz stop here. Hehe, cya all around soon! Shawno OUT! =]

      This morning Sweden thrashed Bulgaria 5-0. A single goal in the first half and four goals in the second. It was pretty amazing and Henrik Larsson was realli good. Well, he basically scored 2 goals in 2 mins. If tt isn't gd enough den I wonder wad is. L0L!  I woke up at 11am today as tuition was at 12pm. *sighz* I was exhausted, pretty drained. Haha, but I'm used to it as I've been in tougher situations. After tuition, I basically slacked for the rest of the day. I'm going for my dinner soon, but b4 tt I juz wanna haf my veri own wish list. This is to remind me of how much I hafta save for all these stuffs.  My Wish List: 1. A New Pouch Frm 77th Street @ The Heeren 2. Kenny G's Greatest Hits 3. Digital Camera 4. Chains/Necklaces 5. Bracelets  These are the top 5 items tt I must get, probably b4 the school reopens. Haha, 3 of them can be found at 77th Street. This will definitely make my life easier as I dun hafta go to different places to get them. I shld be getting my digital camera frm Sim Lim Square either by this wk or nxt wk. I'll update the list again nxt wk or the wk after. At least 3 items shld be gone frm this list when the nxt list cums up. L0L! I guess I'll be waiting for the 2 matches tonite, so tt's about it. I'll update u guys on the results tmr ya? Cya! =]

      Here are the results for yesterday matches: Croatia 0 - 0 Switzerland England 1 - 2 France  Here's the results for today's match: Denmark 0 - 0 Italy  Yesterday was a pretty slack day for me as well. I watched the match between England and France till 4:30am. It was stunning how France won the match in the last 3 mins of the game by scoring 2 goals. Haha, but it was overall a pretty good match.  I woke up at 1pm, skipped breakfast and waited for my lunch. I didn't go anyway yesterday as I was pretty tired after 2 days of staying up late. Haha, I managed to do some of my A Maths revision in the afternoon, b4 falling to slp again. L0L! But in the evening after my dinner, I went back to practising my A Maths. I watched the television frm 10pm onwards all the way to like 2am. The match between Denmark and Italy was at 12am and I wasn't going to miss it. My bet was on Denmark and I was hoping for an upset. It ended up in a nil nil draw, but I must say tt it was pretty entertaining! L0L!  Now, it's already in the morning and I'm waiting for the next match between Bulgaria and Sweden. My bet this time is on Sweden and I'm realli sure tt they will win this one. I checked the newspaper earlier on and I realised tt there will be The Amazing Race at 3am, so I'm going to watch tt as well. I dunnoe which season and episode it is, but I'll be switching channels here and there during tt time. So, tt's basically about it. The match is starting in half an hour's time, so I'll cya some other time ya? =]

      Well, I slept like 5:30am in the morning and guess wad time I woke up? 1:00pm! L0L! I took a shower and ate lunch b4 proceding to gamble. Haha, I'm like an addict already and tt isn't a good thing at all.  I was basically gambling frm 3pm to 8pm. I did win, but once again not as much as the previous two times. It seems tt I'm losing my touch or smt. Haha, I hope I won't win any lesser frm now on. I juz wanna earn more and keep the money in my new piggy bank! L0L! Well, I realised tt I actually haf enough cash now to get some ppl their b'dae presents. But if I actually do den I'll probably be left wif nothing. This Euro 04 is oso the time to earn money. Haha, I'm hoping to earn at least $100 after Euro 04 is over. Well, I'll probably gif some1 a treat after today's winnings. Den again, I might juz save the money or buy some b'dae presents.  I'm juz waiting for the matches tonight to begin. There are two matches, the first is Croatia against Switzerland. I'm definitely rooting for the Croatians to win this one. As for the second match, it's England against France. Apparently, my bet is on England! U can't go wrong wif the underdogs! L0L! I juz do not wan France to win, and my gut tells me tt England is gonna pull this off. I'll update all of u on both the results after the matches. Till den, I'll cya around! =]

      I was suppose to accompany Benson to make his new I.C today. In the end, we went to Cineleisure to see if his I.C was still in the lan shop. Apparently it was! WOW! After 4 days, it's still there. Those kind hearted ppl in tt lan shop actually keep a whole lot of unclaimed EZ Link cards and I.C in a phone book! L0L! Tt's realli nice of them rite? =]  Anyway, in the end we decided not to go Queenways. We chose to scout around Orchard Road as it was the Great Singapore Sales. L0L! We had lunch first at Subway, den we played pool for about an hour plus at Cineleisure. After tt, we walked around Orchard Road to find a suitable pair of shoe for myself.  I wanted to get a pair of outdoor shoes, preferably adidas. Well, but the price was too high, so I didn't get a pair. I'll probably go to Queensway on another day to get them. Haha, but we juz walk around Orchard Road. There was this pouch I realli like at the 77th Street in The Heeren. I didn't buy it at tt time as I was still considering if I shld buy a pair of shoes. I also didn't haf enough money to buy both. So I didn't buy it in the end and I realli regretted it after I realise tt the price of the shoes was juz too high.  So we went to Plaza Singapura's 77th Street to check if it was sold there. We couldn't turn back and return to The Heeren as it was too far and Benson was simply too LAZY! Haha, but unfortunately it wasn't sold there. I managed to buy a pair of shorts and a bracelet. It cost me $44 in total. Well, it was expensive, but I felt tt it was worth it. I actually wanted to get a ring or a necklance too, but there wasn't any rings I liked tt was fitting and the necklaces were kindda expensive. Although Benson offered to pay for me first, I politely rejected it. L0L!  We left Orchard around 9pm to Benson's house. When We were waiting for the train at the Dolby Ghaut MRT station, I was trying on the new necklace tt Benson bought. Honestly, it was quite nice. L0L! There was this erm, gay? Well, I'm pretty sure tt he's a gay! Even Benson said so! Firstly, he wore a pink shirt and secondly, he stood realli like a gay. I dun even noe how to describe the way he stood. The worst thing was tt he was staring and smiling at me when I was trying on Benson's new necklace. Well, this happens pretty often and juz proves tt I'm attractive, but on the other hand, I'm attracting the wrong sex. There are a couple of times when I notice other 'men' staring at me too! OMG! I juz hate it when 'men' stare at me or gif me those kindda seductive face (doesn't tt reminds us of some1? FPC!!! L0L!)  When we reached Benson's house, he packed his stuffs for tmr while i waited patiently. His room is worse than mine! It's messier and untidier than my room! L0L! We slacked there for about half an hour b4 going to the coffee shop near his house for dinner. Then we took a bus to Bukit Batok interchange and went our separate ways. I reached home like 11pm! L0L! I think tt's the latest tt I've ever reached home.  I took a shower and waited for the Euro 04 opening match to start at 11:50pm. It was Portugal against Greece! Portugal was the team I actually supported, but my bet was on Greece. L0L! Well, *sighz* Portugal realli did lose to Greece. The final score was 2-1 to Greece, which was a total upset. Well, I'm still supporting Portugal no matter wad man, Figo my man is in there! Haha, the next match was Spain and Russia. It was a pretty boring match, but I knew frm the start Spain was going to win. I actually tot tt they would score at least 3 goals, but to my surprise, they onli managed to score 1. The final score was 1-0 to Spain.  When everything was over, it was like 4:30am in the morning. I onli managed to slp at like 5:30am. L0L! Well, tt's about it I guess. Cya around! =]

      Well, it's been a pretty slack day. Haha, as usual, but today I managed to do some maths questions from the ten year series so it wasn't tt bad. But the good thing is tt I've plan for the next two days. L0L!  For tmr, I'll be going out wif Benson to make his new I.C. Apparently, he left his I.C at a lan shop and 4got to take it back after he was done playing. Haha, I told him to go back to the lan shop to try his luck, but he didn't want to. Tt's y tmr I'm going wif him to make his I.C. After tt, we'll probably be heading down to Queensway shopping centre as I wan to buy a pair of shoes. Haha, so nice of him to accompany me rite? L0L! At nite, I'll be busy watchin Euro 04. The first match tt kicks off the tournament is Portugal against Greece. I'm supporting Portugal all the way and I noe tt they are going to defeat Greece. It's quite obvious tt Greece stand no chance at all. Haha.  On Sunday, I'll be going to gamble and hopefully earn some money to put them in my new piggy bank. Hehe, but at nite I'll be back to watch the Euro 04 match between England and France I think. Well, I'm pretty sure France is going to win, but let's juz hope tt they flop. I dun even wan them to qualify pass the grp stage. Haha, but they haf a strong team and wif Zidane around, nothing can go wrong. L0L! Well, as for England, I noe tt they're going to flop the tournament like they always do. L0L!  I decided to cum up wif my own music chart too. It's juz to keep me occupied, but I dun even noe if it would daily, weekly or monthly. Haha, most probably when I like it and haf nth betta to do. L0L! These are basically the songs tt I've listening to, most of them are pretty old, but there are some new ones. Haha, so here goes...  Shawno's Music Chart: 10. Kimberley Locke - 8th World Wonder 9. Ronan Keating - She Believes In Me 8. Kurt Nielsen - She's So High 7. Atomic Kittens - Cradle 6. Bob Guiney - Girlfriend 5. Maroon 5 - This Love 4. ATC - Mistake No. 2 3. Guy Sebastian - Angels Brought Me Here 2. Kci & JoJo - All My Life #1. Kelly Clarkson - Beautiful Disaster  Yeap! So tt's about it for today. Hehe, I'll cya around ya? =]

      "Cute is simply the word to describe u. This "Cute" tt I'm talkin about is Adorable BUT Ugly, so dun get the wrong impression and think tt I'm callin u handsome, cus there's no chance in hell! L0L! Well, wad can I say? Knowing u has been a bless. U're always full of energy and entertainment. But u've got to learn ur manners man. Haha, and learn when the right time to do certain stuffs ya? Well, I wouldn't say tt ur caring, but somewhere deep down in ur heart I'm pretty sure u do care rite? Haha, sometimes being a sensitive person is much betta than being an "act man" person. And dun get worry when u can't do pull ups, it's not as if ur gonna burn in hell if u can't do pull ups. Haha, yes train urself, but dun train urself so hard till u injure urself and refuse to wait for recovery. I'm pretty sure tt I made the right decision to get to know u. Sometimes I wonder and think about the way u treat me. I would not say it is good or bad, but I would say tt it's weird cus I simply haf no idea how to define it. Haha, I guess it goes both ways ya? Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad. Well, I can't expect it to be good all the time can I? Where will all the fun go to den? Haha, u're so much similar and different at the same time frm the person I described in "Choices". Well, I think the similar part lies in the physical apperances of both of u. Haha, as for the differences, I think it's the emotional section. One good example is tt u're not as violent like the other person. U dun go all out to beat or abuse me. Haha, tt's a good thing. But I'm not saying tt the other person is bad in doing all those stuffs. As a matter of fact, I find it quite fun u noe? Haha, seriously I do, it juz builds up my endurance and keeps me entertained. Haha, but I am NOT asking u to do the same alrite? Cus I love ya juz the way u r!"  These are my confessions to u* Note: These are 2 different ppl I'm describing in "Choices" and "Choices Part II".  "1 more thing, it's 5 more days to 4 mths after my b'dae! Where's my Cam dude? Hehe!"

      To my surprise, I actually did some work today. Haha, I did some questions for E Maths. Well, at least tt's something to start wif. It's much betta than juz using the com or not doing anything at all. Although I still hafta admit tt I slack quite alot as well. Hehe, but it shld be 1 step at a time rite?  Well, in the evening, around 6:45pm, I met my pri sch fren. Haha, I've using the term "pri sch fren" for almost every single entry when I talk about him. Well firstly they're not diff ppl, it's juz the same person. Secondly, I'll refer to him as Lix frm now on. Yea, so Lix and I went to Pizza Hut to haf dinner, chill and simply relax. We stayed there for like an hour. The bill was like $33 and i dunnoe how many cents. We were basically talking about anything we could think of. Our main topic was Euro 2004. Haha, he predict tt France will emerge as the champs, but he wants Italy to win. As for me, I haf no idea who will win, but I hope tt Portugal does.  We went to West Mall after tt juz to look around. I saw this game on "Troy" which cost onli $9.90! Cheap Original Stuff! Haha, but in the end I didn't buy it although I dunnoe why. Haha, I think tt I'll probably buy it on another day when I get there. I was basically lookin for a Piggy Bank! Yea, u heard me rite! PIGGY BANK!!! Hehe, well I want it cus I want to keep excess money in it and probably use it on important stuffs. For example, b'dae presents, gambling, special ppl, clothes, games and so much more. Well, although there isn't much in there rite now, I hope to accumalate much more. It's like a rectangular shape container made of metal. It was a spider-man mechandise and it cost me $5.90. Pretty cheap rite? Haha, there's a lock and 2 keys too! Wow, I can't wait to save all my money in there! Hehe.  I reached home like 9:30pm and juz chill. I was chatting wif quite a number of ppl on MSN earlier on and watching Fear Factor. Haha, anyway after this entry I think I might writing another entry on "Choices Part II"! Doesn't tt sounds exciting? L0L! Alrite, I gotta go do tt rite now! Cya!!! =]

      I spent the whole day juz thinking. Thinking about my life, studies, relationships and other stuffs. I basically didn't haf anything to do for the day, so thinking and slacking was basically juz wad I did.  I woke up at 12:00pm, feelin realli tired and had not much energy to do anything. I skipped my breakfast and juz went on to use the com. I had my lunch like 1:30pm and after tt I continued using the com till dinner time. Obviously it was a damn slack day for me. While I was playing Winning Eleven 7, I oso thought about all those stuffs. Well, I prefer keeping those stuffs to myself for the moment.  After dinner, I continued using the com, den I watched the television. World Idol was at 10pm and I would not had missed tt for anything. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It juz wasn't the kindda standard tt one would expect. The judges, the contestants, the atmosphere, basically everything juz wasn't up to my expectations. I actually thought tt it would be pretty grand, but it juz wasn't.  Well, my pri sch fren finally got a hp to use, so it's so much easier to contact him now. He asked if he could cum to my house tmr. I said it was up to him, I've no objections to him whenever he asks tt question. Haha, well in the end he said he'll cum another time. Lil' pig did the same thing at nite too. Well, in his case, he didn't ASK, he juz TOLD me tt he might be coming. Now words frm Shawn The Great to the lil' pig: "Boy, this is my house! Not urs! :P" Ahaha, obviously I said no, not cus I didn't want him to come. It was cus I realised tt my whole family will be at home tmr, so it wasn't veri convenient. Yea, nothing much left to say. Cya! =]

      Well I had to wake up early in the morning today to attend some shitz seminar. As u can see, it was shitz! It was extremely boring and a total waste of time as well as money. I didn't manage to slp well last nite, but I was still able to get up like 6am. I was supposed to meet 3 other frens at 7:30am, so tt we can get to the place together. In the end the numbers got multiplied by 2 and there were like at least 6 of them. I didn't even noe shitz bout' this. Even Ze Hao had no idea. The meeting place was oso changed and I was onli informed when I was reaching Clementi. I met Ze Hao while walkin to the Mac near the interchange, he obviously had no clue cuz he was walkin to the opposite direction to the place we were supposed to meet. Luckily he spotted me and I was kind enough to tell him tt the venue had changed.  So there were apparently 8 of us when we took the bus to tt RELC, where the seminar was. And of all ppl in the world, my enemy or u can say the person i truly dislike had to be 1 of the 8 ppl. So I pretty much couldn't be bothered, I juz kept quiet all the way. If I knew he was coming along, I wouldn't be there at all. I made this code clear to myself "If he's there, den I wouldn't be there unless it's realli necessary."  The seminar like I said was boring shitz, I dun think I would want to elaborate on it. It was a waste of time and a waste of money. I still can't believe I paid $25 for tt shitz when I could haf used tt money to gamble or to treat some1 to a game of pool. I wasn't paying attention at all thru out the whole thing. I was basically tryin to slp, but when u haf ppl like Benson around, u can nvr fall asleep! Damnit, he kept wakin me up whenever I was this close to slping! Grrr, I think no1 has come this close b4! I hate it when ppl wake me up when I'm hafing my beauty slp, whether it's a phone call or wadeva. So the seminar was like frm 9am - 12pm. I was starving when it was onli half way thru. Time realli "flies" and it ended realli "quick".  I was actually supposed to go to Orchard wif Ze Hao, Sian Yang and Gervais. Tt was all the ppl I knew were going at first. Den I found out poor lil' SY wasn't feelin alrite and had to go home. Nxt I found out tt other ppl were going as well, 1 of them was none other den my enemy. How WONDERFUL! So I had no choice but to follow my code. I could tell tt Ze Hao was pretty pissed when I told him tt I wasn't going anymore cuz I actually agreed wif him way b4 hand tt I'll be going. I dun like pulling out at the last minute, but I tot tt it was for the betta.   Juz to clear things up, these are the reasons why I chose not to go. Firstly, if SY wasn't going den I'll be an outcast if I went, whether they agree anot I dun care, cus this is juz how I realli feel. He's the onli one tt actually does talk to me when we go out together, the rest either do not care or wadsoeva. I simply can't be bothered wif them. Secondly, I had to go wif my code and not break it. No way am I going out wif my enemy, like duh. Thirdly, I rather be wif Anwar than wif them cus both of us do not haf this "communication breakdown" thing whenever we're together. He nvr fails to communicate wif me, whether it's serious stuffs or nonsensical stuffs. This is the kind of person I wanna be wif, some1 I can communicate wif easily. Some1 who will ACTUALLY talk to me and not leave me alone. As for the grp of frens I was supposed to be wif, I juz felt tt I had a communication breakdown wif everi single 1 of them excluding SY and probably WQ. This was why I chose to leave them and go to Jurong East to meet Anwar. I dunnoe wad they think of me, but I dun care. I rather be wif 1 person who I can communicate well wif than a hugh grp of ppl who I haf a communication breakdown wif.  Well, things didn't go according to plan. Anwar couldn't make it in the end cus of some stuffs. Luckily my lower sec clsmate was in the same bus as me, so I juz went wif fate. We went for lunch first, den we went lan gaming for an hour. After tt we went to watch Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban, which was 2hrs long. It was 5pm when the show ended and I made my way home. Amazingly I reached home at 5:30pm, which was surprisingly fast. L0L! Rite now, I'm juz hafing serious thoughts bout' everithing tt happened today. I'm thinkin about who my true frens realli are and I'm realli beginning to see who they are. Unfortunately, I can see tt my frenship wif tt grp of frens isn't going to last long. I kindda see wad's gonna happen, but I'm juz reluctant to accept it. I see tt my frenship wif these ppl after the 'O' Lvls isn't going to last, it'll probably end realli fast. I juz hope tt it wouldn't turn out this way and I juz wish tt they will do smt to prevent it. But tt isn't for me to decide. Tt's for them to think if they wanna continue their frenship wif me. So I'll juz let fate decide, I'll noe when the time cums.  This has been 1 of the most or the most emotional entry I've written. I'm neither depressed nor angry about it, I'm juz gifing it serious thought. But it will probably stay in my head for a pretty long time. And I think I might finally haf a chance to go to KL frm around these dates: 17-21 June. Isn't tt great? Haha, guess tt's it for today. Cya all! And remember, the key to frenship ---> Communication! L0L! Tt's juz 1 of the most important factors, there are many others as well, but tt's all I'm gifing for today. =]

      Woah, today I slept till like 1pm. I was extremely tired and simply didn't want to wake up. I simply spent my day playing Winning Eleven 7, watching the television and chatting on msn messenger. Yea, today was basically a damn slack day. A lot of time was wasted on slacking and stuffs.  As u can see frm the tag board, the fat pussy cat used my name and stuffs. He always tries his best to irritate me. Haha, always saying I'm skinny when I'm thin and many other stuggs. Although he may seem to be a rather irritating guy who juz loves gettin on ppl's nerves, he's not like tt. Haha, I can't believe I'm saying this. Seriously, he's a nice and fun guy to be wif. I dun wish to elaborate further, ahaha. But in my eyes, he's still a fat pussy cat! L0L!  Well, nothing much happened today. It was a simply boring day! There's realli nothing to do or nobody to play wif when I'm at home. So yea, I think u shld noe by now how bored I actually am at home. Tt's y I'm always finding ppl to go out wif, whether it's juz for a dinner or a game of pool. Yea, tmr I'm hafing some 'o' lvl seminar at this RELC, so I hafta haf an early nite. Cya! =]

      I woke up early today for A Maths tuition. I had no choice, my A Maths is realli tt bad, so I decided to gear myself up this June Holidays. Well, it lasted one a half hours, wasn't tt bad after all.  After tuition I was basically slacking till 4pm when my Pri Sch fren rang me up. He asked me if I wanted to go out. My answer was a definite YES as I was extremely bored. Man, there's like nothing to do at home. I've nobody to play wif except my com, which is unfortunately a non-living thing. My sister and I can't get along at all, so we are always like away frm one another. Yea, so I've basically haf no1 to talk wif and play wif at home. Yea, it's sad, I feel the same way too. L0L!  Yea, so I meet up wif my pri sch fren and went to West Mall once again. Tt's like the place I slack at, so ya, we headed there to slack. L0L! We caught this 5pm sneak preview of the Punisher, which is NC16. My veri first NC16 movie. Well, tt was realli some violent shit man. Haha, an extremely bloody show, when it's supposed to be some Marvel comic movie? Well... I dunnoe, but it was nice. I'll gif it a 8/10 at least.  When I got home, I got a hell lot of scolding frm my mum cuz of nothing. She was juz angry wif my sister and juz wanna find somebody to scold. This happens all the time. Haha, but I dun care. I continued to slack and play my Winning Eleven 7. Well, I got pretty fed up playing wif it tt's y I'm bloggin rite now. It's kindda boring to play wif the com cuz they haf limited skills and well it juz isn't real.  U noe wad, I'm realli so damn bored at home during the holidays. Tt's y I'll always find ppl to go out wif or smt. It's like *sigh* so hard to explain when u haf nobody to talk to and stuffs. It's like being all alone and tt's juz darn boring man. Sometimes, I'll juz lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling thinkin about my life in a different way. Oh yea, I can think all I bloody want, but it's never gonna change! So I juz haf to accept the damn fact tt oh well I can't be bothered to finish this, it makes me sick. Cya den! =]

      Well, I nearly 4got about my blog today. I went to slp, but received an unexpected phone call frm Benson. He wanted me to come back online and send him all his photos. At first I didn't want to cus I was already lying on my bed, but when he visited my blog and told me tt I didn't update it today, I had no choice. L0L! So I decided to come back online to send him his photos and at the same time update my blog. Hehe.  Well, I went to school like 12:30pm today to try and get my report book, but my form teacher said tt I couldn't get it. She said she would onli gif after the talk, which starts at 2pm and ends like 4pm. So, I was basically slacking in school and wasting time. I was supposed to go out to who knows where wif the lil' pig and the fat pussy cat, but tt nvr happened. I do not wish to elaborate on why.  So when I was finally able to leave the school, it was already 6pm. Me, Benson and Chee Chong went to Ginza to haf dinner and play pool. We ate dinner at this Sakura restaurant and the bill was $44.55, but it was pretty worthwhile. Compared to other restaurants, this is 1 of the cheapest tt I've been to so far. After dinner, We went to play pool for an hour. It was the first time tt I was playing wif them cus I'll usually onli play wif Anwar. I paid for the game, which was $7 den I went home.  I bought this Winning Eleven 7 game, which cost me $6, frm some pirated game shop. It's realli fun compared to Fifa '04. The graphics and gameplay are basically betta. But I do get tired of playin wif the com at times cus it juz isn't real. If some1 would come over to my place to play it wif me, den tt will definitely be much more fun. It's such a waste tt I do not haf an elder blood brother. Haha, I can imagine tt man. We'll probably be playing the com together and wrestling in the room. I'll oso haf the chance to play pool more often as he would be the one paying. Ahaha, but well I dun haf an elder blood bro, so I juz haf to live life the way it is and well, do those stuffs wif frens instead. L0L! Guess I'll stop here for today. Cya! =]

      Today was actually supposed to be a slack day for me. I wasn't going anywhere cuz I was kindda tired. I had been out for the past few days so I decided to rest at home. So yea, I was basically slacking at home, playin wif the com and slping.  In the afternoon when I tried slping, the fat pussy called me up and asked for directions. Lil' pig was wif him too and they were heading to the fat pussy cat's cousin's house to do some stuffs. His cousin's house was pretty close to mine tt's y they asked me for directions. About half an hour later, I received another call from the lil' pig. This was our conversation...  Lil pig: "What storey do you live on?" Me: "Why do u wanna noe?" Lil pig: "Juz tell me leh" Me: "Why??? I dun wan u to cum burn my hse!" Lil pig: "Won't one la" Me: "Den why u wanna noe?" Lil pig: "Cuz I wanna visit u. U live on the 3rd storey rite?" Me: "Yes, where r u?" Lil pig: "I'm at ur storey now." (I walked to my house door and look thru the hole.) Me: "OMG, wad r u guys doing there?" Lil pig: "I wanna go ur hse la!" Me: "Go downstairs, I'll c u guys there in 5mins."  Now tt was unexpected and shocking! But when I stepped out of my hse 5mins later, the 2 of them were sitting at the stairs waiting for me. The lil' pig even used his camera phone to take a picture! Dotz.Dotz.Dotz. They were laughing and stuffs and we were debating on whether to enter my hse as my mum was at home. L0L! But me, as u all noe, being a nice polite guy had no choice but to invite them in. Well, it was a pretty big mistake especially when u haf tt fat pussy cat around. L0L!  They came into my room and made a hugh mess out of it. 3 of us were basically fighting to use the com. The fat pussy cat even wrestled wif me on my bed! Yucks! His disgusting body on my bed!!! OMG!!! He tried making me tap out, but u noe I won't tap out frm tt fat pussy cat! I had my home advantage too! L0L! But honestly, it was fun to haf them around. It's like when I'm bored, there are ppl tt I'm able to talk wif and play wif. Tt's why it was realli entertaining to haf them around, seriously speaking. Haha, they left about an hour or so later. I walked them downstairs as I didn't want any accidents to occur at my blk. Haha, when i was back on the 3rd storey, I saw them both and well u guys shld noe tt something silly will definitely occur. Stupid fat pussy cat was shouting "Shawn Shawn" for at least 3 times in such a gay tone! Oh man, let's juz hope tt the ppl in my blk do not noe who I am.  Well at 11:05pm, the fat pussy cat called me juz to make fun of me. He thinks tt mobile phone bills dun hafta be paid. Haha, he was basically calling me names and exaggerating on how he was gonna cum my house and destroy me and blah blah blah. A whole lot of crap from him, which lasted for 18mins! L0L! Well, one thing's for sure now. There's no way and I do mean no way tt I'm gonna let him cum my hse again cuz he does realli realli stupid stuffs! L0L! Juz kidding, cya peers around! =]

      I was supposed to meet my frens for breakfast opposite the sch today at 10am. I was 15mins late and the lil' pig was making a hell lot of noise. L0L! But the fat pussy cat wasn't even there! L0L! He came like 5mins after me, walking like a King and shaking tt fat @$$ of his. L0L!  Well, today was my 'O' Lvl Food and Nutrition cooking practical exam. It didn't go according to plan. Haha, but it was still pretty alrite. I managed to juz pass, which is already good enough for me. We reached there at 11:00am and everything was over at 3:00pm. L0L! tt was realli long and tiring.  After the practical, the fat pussy cat forced me to follow him and the lil' pig to watch Troy again. He even threatened me! How mean of him! L0L! So we headed down to Jurong Point to catch it. The next time slot was 6:05pm and it was onli 4:05pm when we got there. So we had 2hrs before the movie began. We went to Long John Silver and slack there for about an hour and a half. There was nothing realli happening, I juz suddenly lost my mood and was kindda down, but thank god the fat pussy cat was there to bring laughter and joy. L0L!  When it was close to 6:05pm, we went in and waited in there. Yea, so nothing much happened in the cinema, juz watching Troy for the second time. It was kindda boring, but I guess it wasn't tt bad. L0L! The fat pussy cat was threatening to whack me for no particular reason! Wad a bully! Hmmph! L0L!  I reached home like 9:30pm and yea tt's bout' it for the day. So, peace ya? Haha, cya guys around! =]

      Tomorrow's mine Food and Nutrition 'O' Lvl Cooking Practical Examination. So I decided to practice today so I tt I would be prepared for tomorrow. I woke up early to prepare and cook the dishes for my family members to try it out. It was pretty ok cus nothing burned, so I juz hope it goes the same for tomorrow. Honestly, I'm pretty proud of my accomplishment. Haha, cus I'm not a good cook and I dun usually cook at home. Well, I was pretty tired after the whole thing, but I still had to clean the place up and stuffs.  I tasted my food for lunch and it wasn't bad at all, surprisingly. Haha, i rest a little while in the noon before heading off to gamble. L0L! I did earn some cash, but it wasn't alot, so it was kindda disappointing. Haha, but I suppose tt it's betta than nothing.  I juz finished doing 3 menu cards for my cooking practical tomorrow. 1 for me, 1 for the lil' pig and 1 for the fat pussy cat. They're so mean! Force me to do it! Hmmph! So therefore both of them owe me a treat at Starbucks! Hehehe, I'm so tired now, I'm like half asleep. Well, I guess I betta haf an early nite. The big day's tomorrow. L0L! Big day sounds like a wedding of some sort. Well, guess I'll end here, too tired to continue. Shawny OUT! =]

      "Sometimes I feel tt he's a fun guy to be wif, other times I feel tt he's a pain in the ass" - Rupert Boneham from Survivor All Stars.  *Sighz* I feel exactly the same way about certain ppl. They can realli be fun and great to be wif, but sometimes they juz dun noe their limit. They keep on going without stopping and without thinking of how the person actually feels. They will probably treat it as a joke without realising how much pain they had caused for the other person. Tt's how I realli feel rite now. I won't say I'm pissed, but I'll definitely say tt I'm disappointed. The reason is tt I feel realli close wif this person and I juz think tt this person shld understand me more than others, but to do something like tt juz proves to me tt I'm wrong. I guess tt in life, some mistakes juz cannot be avoided no matter how hard u try to. I juz hope tt this person, or preferably these ppl will noe their limit and not overdo it. I realli wish tt they can juz show some care and concern towards me, but the way i see it, it's nearly impossible. Like the Black Eyed Peas would say "Where Is The Love?"  Nothing much happened today, I juz bought a infrared port for my computer. It cost me $39, but I feel tt it'll definitely be cheaper than constantly sending things frm my mobile phone to my computer. Tt's the reason why I bought it. I'm like realli sleepy and drunk rite now, but still apparently open-minded. I definitely feel rejected, dejected, disappointed and so much more, but there's nothing I can do. If onli I could cast a spell, but tt would totally change somebody, he or she wouldn't be the same anymore. I'm drifting away rite now, I'm drunk, haha. Drinking pretty much helps when u're depressed u noe? Especially if u've got a hugh bottle or like 10 cans. Haha, but even though I'm so damn drunk, I'll probably be unable to slp. These kindda things clot up my head and stays there. It stops me frm slping till I actually solve the goddamnit problem and shitz. So this is pretty much the way I feel rite now.  "I am shock by the amount of disrespect u've got." - Paula Abdul, judge of American Idol. Oh hell wif this thing, I dun even noe how to conclude it. Let's juz say i aint gonna end this shitz till i actually do solve this shitz although I dun even haf a single idea of wad I'm typing rite now, but I'm sure it's the truth. I dun even noe wad I've been tryin to say, but heck wif it, I dun care. So wad more do u wan rite now huh? This is sick, juz sick!

      How else can u start off a day? Haha, nothing beats starting wif the Chinese 'O' Level Examinations. So, I went into the exam hall wif my target at an A2. I never told my frens bout' this b4 as I noe they will probably laugh cus I haven been passing my Chinese for quite some time already. So paper 1 was normal, as for paper 2, I juz dun see myself failing. I dun think I can get an A2, I'm juz hoping to get at least a B4 rite now. Haha, but it's over at last! Finally...  I made my way home to rest and chill awhile b4 meeting my fren. We went to Jurong Entertainment Centre to play pool for bout' 2hrs. It was so relaxing man, finally no worries again. Haha, but I didn't haf much luck. It was still enjoyable though none the less.  We went to KFC for dinner den made our way down to this Cash Converter shop. My fren wanted to buy a joystick for his pilot game, so I juz accompanied him to explore the place. I spotted a BenQ 2.1 Megapixil Digital Camera, which looked totally brand new. It had no scratches at all and it was shining brightly. Furthermore, it cost onli $135! OMG! I haf to get tt man, it's so small, slim and compact too. I'll find the money to get tt sooner or later, hopefully sooner. Hehehe.  We went to Popular next, juz to waste some time b4 heading home. So it's like 12:00+am now and I'm still awake typing this entry. I haf no activities for tomorrow at the moment, hopefully I get to do something. Haha, anyway my injury seems to be getting betta day by day. So no worries anymore. Cya guys around! =]

      He's still not talkin to me. Well, I decided not to go on like this anymore. I will juz go on wif my life and let him go on wif his. I dun wanna waste my time on frenships tt I noe wont turn out well in the end. He dun even wanna look at me or talk to me, so yea he said he dun wanna lose a great fren, but obviously he isn't tryin to prevent tt frm happenin. I'm tired of tryin to start a conversation wif him when all I get is nth but ignored. No doubt I dun wanna lose a fren as well as a brother like him, but if he refuse to talk to me, there's basically nth tt I can do. Obviously he doesn't wanna haf anything to do wif me anymore. Yea, so am I suppose to approach him when he doesn't even wanna look at me? I dun think so. So I wonder now who's the one tt's not doing his part to maintain our frenship. Well, I'm definitely not gonna try to talk to him again cuz I haf already gave up tryin. We'll juz hafta go our separate ways frm now on unless he choose to do smt bout' it. I may haf loss a good fren and brother, but he loss juz as much as well if not even more.  The day was pretty enjoyable. There were lotsa laughs wif Mal and Kumar, especially during focus. Haha. Science focus ended much earlier today compared to other days. I managed to&nbsp;reach home like 5:30pm, which is a pretty good thing. I did maths till dinner time and now I'm basically slackin. I'm considering if I shld do my F&amp;N, but I dun feel like doing it, so I'll probably leave it alone. Haha, I juz wanna do smt tt would make me take away all the pain and sorrows of losing a fren and bro. At the same time, I'm also thinkin if I shld make a move to ask her bout' it, but I dun think it's the rite time after losing smt tt's been there for quite awhile. Devastated, I am, but I realli do feel disappointed as well. May god bless me and may fate take it's course. All I can do now is to hope for the best as I'll leave our frenship in his hands, and his onli. Tt's bout' it for today, I'll inform u more another time. Cya.

      I went shoppin at Queensway yesterday wif a fren, bought 2 pairs of shorts. It totalled up to like $30+ already. 1 was $25 and the other was $18. After that we went to west mall juz to walk around. Apparently some Chinese Band called F.I.R was there for an autograph session. Well, obviously the place was packed, realli packed. West Mall was never this packed b4. The crowd was juz overwhelming and LOUD. They simply went nuts when F.I.R arrived, screaming like they never screamed b4. Well, it was cool as I never thought West Mall will ever be sucha attraction. L0L! Apparently I'm wrong. The place was juz flooded wif ppl. It was hard to move around and when the 1st storey couldn't contain every1, the rest went up to another storey. The queue was like all the way outside the shoppin centre and it continued in circles and circles and circles and circles and circles. Yea, I had to squeeze my way outta there to get home. L0L!  Anyway today was a pretty slack day. I spent my time in school slackin and wastin time. There was basically veri little work to be done today. L0L! After sch, I was supposed to play pool wif Anwar, but I felt like watchin a movie. It was a pretty complicated situation seriously. So anyway, Wei Qiang wanted Sian Yang to meet him at the hawker centre opposite the school, so I went wif Sian Yang to find Wei Qiang. At the hawker centre, we had lunch and checked the movie timeslot. We realised tt the time wasnt suitable as the earliest was 5pm. In the end, I didnt play pool or catch a movie. Hmmm, well the gd thing is tt I saved my money! L0L! Anyway, Sian Yang spotted Lynn frm the hawker centre. Apparently, she was walkin to Clementi Interchange wif a fren. He got pretty excited and started chasin after them, so me and Wei Qiang followed. We mixed and mingled wif them all the way. Lynn's fren took a bus home, while the rest of us went on to the MRT station. There are some quick observations I made bout Lynn. First of all, she's fairer than me. Secondly, she's veri naive. She believed tt I wasnt Singaporean. Nvm bout' tt cuz Sian Yang spat out the truth. L0L! But the thing is tt she's pretty sociable and tt's a good thing.  Speakin of observations, I realised tt I hafta do my F&N observations shitz now. Damn, it's boring and tiring, but it's life. Oh well, guess I'll hafta stop crappin here for today. Cya soon~! =]

        Well, haven been bloggin for a couple of days, so I'm juz gonna say wad's been happenin for the past few days. Well, I think I'll juz sum up this wk's happenings. Haha.       &nbsp;      Well, on monday, I received this email from Gervais after he read my blog. Well, I'm not gonna say wad he wrote in there cuz it's like more than 1pg long. I was kindda pissed after readin tt as I felt tt some stuff he wrote bout' me in there wasn't true. I didnt reply him instantly as I had a pretty hard time controlling my emotions, so I decided not to reply. When I managed to relax a lil' bit, I realised something tt I didn't think bout' earlier. By takin time juz to write an email and expressin how he feels to me, I feel tt he's being sincere. I dunnoe wad others think and I dun realli care, but tt juz proves tt he's sincere bout' our frenship and tt he will like to maintain it. Well, I was glad he did write tt to me in the end.      &nbsp;      On tuesday, life was normal and I decided tt I shld gif&nbsp;Gervais a reply and not hold anything back. So, I wrote back a reply and expressed all&nbsp;my feelings. I was glad I did tt. At nite, I told him to check his inbox, he told me tt he read it already and continued talkin bout our misunderstanding and stuff. Seriously, I'm realli grateful tt he chat wif me on msn and told me more stuff tt will make us haf a stronger frenship. I always believe tt to haf a strong frenship, there needs to be an arguement. Well, tt's cause it makes us understand each other betta. So far, all of my strong frens I haf&nbsp;had an arguement wif me b4. I realised tt an arguement onli brings us closer if u do patch up. Well, but he said this to me " I dun wanna force u to come talk to me. neither do i wanna force myself too.so i'll juz let it be natural n mutual." So my guess was tt he wasn't interested to come talk to me anymore and I think I was rite bout' tt. Den it leads me to think whether I would wanna talk to him again, well I do, but I dun think I'll be able to if it goes on like this, so I'll juz hafta wait for the rite&nbsp;time.       &nbsp;      On wednesday, he didnt talk to me and I didnt talk to him either. L0L! sounds kindda lame rite? I rushed home to rest and watched The Amazing Race at     8pm    on AXN. After tt I juz slacked and didnt do much as I was tired and needed&nbsp;a rest. I slept early tt nite.      &nbsp;      On thursday, there was still no conversation started by either one of us. I finally start to realise wad he means by natural n mutual. But well, I'll juz hafta live wif tt. After sch I went wif Sian Yang to catch a movie at west mall. I realised smt wasn't quite rite when he told his B.B pals tt he wouldn't going wif them. I asked him on the way when we were walkin to the bus stop if he had anything. I said if he did he can always go back. He said it didnt hafta do wif any B.B stuff and told me the real reason why he didnt wanna be wif them. On the 176 bus to West Mall, well it was a totally different side of Sian Yang tt I nvr seen b4. I realised how this guy realli is and tt he's a realli nice, sweet and sensitive guy. The onli problem was tt ppl took advantage of his kindness. He told me some stuff bout' certain ppl tt I nvr knew. Well, I was realli shocked tt those ppl were actually like tt, I didnt noe wad to say. Anyway, we had lunch and watched King Arthur at    4pm   . The movie wasn't tt bad like most ppl said it was, actually I enjoyed it too. And watching a movie wif Sian Yang is definitely fun too. L0L!      &nbsp;      Today is Friday and dun be surprised when I say we're still not talkin. L0L!&nbsp;I dun think the time is rite yet, but I do hope when we start talkin again, I'll be able to open up to him more and enjoy being around wif him more. Well, I'm not sayin tt I didn't enjoy being wif him last time, I actually did haf a hell lot of fun wif him. But I'm juz hoping tt there will be&nbsp;more fun and enjoyment in the future.&nbsp;L0L!&nbsp;Man, some ppl juz ought to be thought to respect others and not gif tt stupid fucked up face. Well, how I wish tt bastard get to be thought a lesson. He's so damn lucky tt&nbsp;it wasn't in the public, cuz if it was, he'll probably get whacked by&nbsp;others&nbsp;till he starts&nbsp;bleeding. And guess wad, if I was wif him in public, I wont even help him as tt was some bitchass son of a bitch face shown by a disrespectful piece of crap! Yes, and I was totally Disgusted by his behaviour and some others who laughed at someone who they actually think is harmless. Egoistical Bastards who think tt they're the best fighters in the world. I won't be surprised to see them on their knees prayin for mercy in the near future.      &nbsp;      Well,&nbsp;tt's basically sums up the wk in juz 1 LONG entry. L0L! Alrite den, I'll update u some other time, maybe not daily anymore, but once in 2-3 days when there's some happenings. Well the #1 thing on the list of wad I shld do nxt wk is to talk to Gervais and start openin up more to him. Yup! Tt's bout' it for today. Cya soon~! =]

      Today was a pretty ordinary day except for the fact tt fat pussy cat didnt talk to me. He seems realli pissed wif me, but I dun even noe why. It's not as if I said or did something to hurt him. Well, I dun even noe if I did, but I'm definitely feelin guilty rite now. I juz hope tt he starts talkin to me again and soon and tell me wad's the problem if there's any. I juz cant bring myself to talk to him if he keeps ignoring me and staying away frm me. *Sighz* &nbsp; Focus today ended early, so I managed to get home and completed some work. I did my maths and helped Mal did some research on his English topic b4 proceeding to study for my physics test tmr. I haf a veri bad feelin bout' tt test tmr too, I'm pretty&nbsp;sure tt I'll fail this time. Anyway, I'm like chattin while bloggin and basically slackin. Guess tt's bout it I suppose. Well, I dunnoe wad fat pussy cat has against me rite now, but he seems to be going against me in veri possible way. It makes me start thinkin wad brothers shld realli be like. I hope he will come talk to me and tell me wad's wrong by tmr. Well tt's bout it, Cya yall. =[

      Well, I haven been bloggin for the past few days, so this has wad been happening. &nbsp; On Sat, I had to go to Ngee Ann Poly for some Maths Dignostic Test and Talk. It was worth my time as I finally decided on wad course I would like to go to. Tt course is Aerospace Technology. I felt tt it was veri interesting and different frm the rest of the courses, tt's why I realli wanna get into it. After tt, I headed straight home without hafing my lunch as I couldn't find some1 to chill wif. I did some research on certain stuff at home b4 going out. I went gambling frm 3pm all the way to 8pm. I&nbsp;managed to earn much more money than usual, about twice as much frm the previous times. Well, I'm gonna save up tt money first as I needa buy some stuff. My piggy bank has like $200 in it rite now. I managed to save like $50/wk, which I feel is totally great. L0L!  &nbsp;  On Sun, I had tuition frm 12:00pm all the way to 1:30pm. I did my E Maths homework after tt b4&nbsp;I redid&nbsp;my F&amp;N introduction for task B. After I&nbsp;had&nbsp;completed all of tt, I chilled for the rest of the day. I didnt wanna go out as I didnt wanna spend the money tt I had juz earned. I figured out tt I wasn't gonna waste the money and tt I shld save up instead as I needa to buy some other stuff. L0L!  &nbsp;  Today was pretty tiring. Nothing much happened though. After sch, I had my practical for the F&amp;N task B. Fat pussy cat and lil' pig asked me out for lunch, but I chose not to go due to certain issues. The prac was realli long, it was much of a disaster, but I still managed to pull it off somehow. After the prac, I went to Clementi Interchange wif the fat pussy cat and lil' pig as piggy wanted to eat. In the end, we went to 7-11 to grab some stuff. I felt tt fat pussy cat was kindda hostile and cold towards after tt prac. I haf no idea why, he juz didn't wanna talk to me and stuff, so I juz kept quiet and kept a distance away frm him. I figured out tt was the onli solution to the problem. I took a cab frm Clementi Interchange wif lil' pig to his house first b4 proceeding to mine. He told me some rather interesting and amusing stuff in the cab tt made me start thinkin. L0L!  &nbsp;  When I got home, I took a shower, ate my dinner and watched the television. Mortal Kombat was on and I wasn't gonna miss it. Luckily, there isn't any homework tt I hafta hand in tmr. I completed my work during the wkends and there isn't much homework today too. Well, I guess I'll stop here for now. Cya soon~! =]

      I haven been bloggin for 3 days already. So this entry is gonna cover the happenings for the past 3 days although there weren't much. L0L!   Yesterday was quite a horrible day for me. In school, some realli fucked up things happened, I can't tolerate such arrogant behaviour man. When some1 finally gets the chance to take a photo wif u, u can't even smile 1 sec. U think u're some sorta superstar and shitz. Like WTF man, u obviously dun noe wad it means to others. Well, screw tt. When I got home, I was feelin kindda ill, so I took a nap. I also had some relationship problems wif certain ppl, but screw tt as well. I slept till like 7:30pm. I woke up for dinner and watch The Amazing Race at 8pm till 9pm. I refused to reply sms or calls till it was after 9pm. I didnt want to due to certain reasons. I started doing some work for lil' pig and b4 I knew it some shitz happened. My parents were arguing bout' who knows wad and somehow I got myself into it. Well, it was crap and I dun feel like talkin bout it. Luckily, there were ppl who I chould talk wif and they did their best to cheer me up. I told my problem to some ppl, but chose not to tell the rest. Well, I this point of time, I realli dunnoe who actually cares bout' me, so I'm juz making a wild guess and hopefully I'm rite bout' it.  Well, as for today, my main objective was to be happy. I had a choice of being sad or happy, it was totally up to me. So I chose to be happy and I did a pretty gd job to do so. I 4got bout' wad happened yesterday and moved on. After sch was the time to talk bout my situation yesterday. I went for lunch wif Mal at the hawker centre and had a talk wif him. Soon, Derrick and Anwar came and we decided to go and play pool for awhile. Derrick played 2 games onli and left as he had some other stuff going on. I continued playin wif Anwar for 3 more games. I feel tt everytime I'm wif him, it's like so much betta than being wif many other ppl. We get along well and I juz find him to be a realli close fren to me. Well, at least there's 1 person out there. Haha.  When I got home, I uploaded some pics and videos to my com. I sent them to some ppl already and started bloggin. I juz realised tt I hafta complete some stuff, so I guess I'll hafta end here for today. Alrite den, cya soon~ =]

      The day was full of practicals, first full Chem den Physics. English was kindda boring as all we did was some compre passage bout' Harry Potter. For F&N, we made some cakes and I had to run away frm the fat pussy cat as he was chasing me. He wanted to lift me up and carry me, and yes he did tt a couple of times in front of the cls. I asked him politely "Hao Wan Ah?", and he replied "Hao Wan!". L0L! Yea, I hafta admit tt it's fun as well, but it's embarrassing. It made me look like a weaklin, who's probably too weak to walk and therefore need some1 to carry me awhile. Well, the whole cls was lookin as well as the teachers. Boy was tt embarrassing and man is he strong! -.="  After sch was our F&N 'O' Lvl plannin for task B. It went pretty alrite, I actually managed to do some stuff. L0L! It lasted for like 1.5 hrs and after tt I finally had the chance to eat something. I went to Clementi wif lil' pig and fat pussy cat for "lunch", it was like 4 plus already at tt time. Hehe, those 2 lil' bros of mine can be realli nice. Haha, they went to help me order food and drinks, while I waited for them at the table. L0L! Tt's wad brothers are for! Hehe.  Well, I reached home at 6pm and did my Physics b4 completing my English Presentation on Thursday. While I was doing tt, a question pop into my head. Tt question was "Wad is a godbrother?" Well, I dunnoe wad others think. For me, I feel tt if u acknowledge some1 as ur godbrother, u hafta treat him like ur veri own brohter. And no, for me it isn't for fun like juz callin each other bros. I treat my godbros wif care and love. Muahahaha, I gif them the best I possibly can. Tt's why any1 who haf me as their godbro is damn lucky! L0L! Well, of cuz I would love to get back tt same treatment, but den again, it rarely does happens. Well, care and love is all tt is needed I guess, not forgettin trust. Oh wait, maybe there's more. Hehe, alrite I'll leave u wif this question in ur head ya? Cya~ =]

      I woke up today at around 11am to do my English compre. I was fully concentrating on my work as I was chattin on msn and doing other stuff while tryin to complete the compre. In the end, I onli managed to finish it around 2pm. L0L! Kindda long for a compre eh?  The rest of the day was basically slack for me. I started workin on my English Presentation on Thursday. I'm topic was actually "U.S Roles In Iraq", but I managed to swap wif the lil' pig, how kind of him. Hehe. So, my topic now is on Reality TV, my favourite topic out of the rest on the board. L0L! I must thank lil' pig for lettin me do it.  I did research on some reality tv shows and started on the powerpoint presentation. I did about 6pgs and I'm like halfway through already. I haf to find time the to complete the rest of it by Thursday. I'll probably be able to if I focus on it. I realised tt most shows I watched on television are most of the time reality tv shows as well. Let's see, probably 9/10 tv shows I watch are reality tv shows. Well, I juz like watchin reality tv shows. Maybe cuz it's real and shows wad actually realli happens, unlike dramas, which are most of the time, fake.  Well, tt's basically bout' it for the day's activities. Tmr is back to school for me and I'm gonna haf an early rest now. So, I'll cya some other time ya? =]

      I had tuition today frm 11am - 12:30pm. I managed to understand certain parts of Physics and Chemistry tt I was confused bout' b4. Luckily, my tuition teacher was able to explain it to me. I slacked for the rest of the day till bout' evening time. My whole family was out by tt time, so I decided to go out as well.  I went to seach for a new school bag as my current one had a hole. My keys were nearly lost once, but luckily tt hole wasn't big enough for my keys to escape. Unfortunately, it has now become bigger. I went to west mall first den to jurong point. At jurong point, there were more shops to look for bags. There were shops like Converse, World of Sports, Royal Sporting House and All Bags. There were at least 1 bag in each shop tt I liked, but I decided to get the Adidas bag frm All Bags. It cost me $26, but I thought it was pretty worth it. I oso saw this Fila pouch in All Bags tt I realli liked, but I couldn't buy it. I had to save money to buy fat pussy cat's soccer boots. *Sighz* Haha.  I came back to Bukit Batok Interchange and had my dinner at Mac. I proceeded home after tt and nobody was home yet. Haha, so I was first to return back home. I took a shower and came online to blog. At the same time, I'm oso watchin Simple Life on Chan 5, kindda lame reality tv programme. L0L! Well, tt's bout' it for today. Cya ard~ =]

      There was P.E and floor ball again today. It wash juz as much tiring like yesterday, I managed to score 2 goals for my team, but I dunnoe who won in the end. I juz can't seem to score more than 2 goals. L0L! Hopefully I can get the chance to score a hat trick nxt wk. 4 goals in 2 matches isn't bad at all too. L0L!  I was squashed by tt fat pussy cat today while we were waitin for the nxt period teacher to come. He kept sitting on me and refused to budge. He also did stupid stuff to me as usual. At one point he used his stinkin back to lean against me! YUCKS! At least he didnt use other parts of his stinkin body. L0L!  The rest of the day was slack and boring. After sch was Chinese Oral at 2:30pm, which was like 2hrs after sch was over. I didnt haf breakfast, recess or lunch on tt day and boy was I suffering. I was tired, exhausted and drained. By the time I faced the examiners, I was lost for words. I think tt was a total disaster, but I juz hope to pass, tt's good enough for me already.  After the damn oral was over. I went to Jurong Entertainment Centre wif Alvin to finally grab a bite. Man was tt gd. He told me some stuff bout' frenship and ppl in our cls. It's pretty surprising to hear wad he had to say bout' certain ppl in cls. Although he wasn't the first person to tell me this kindda stuff, but it was still pretty astonishing. I haf heard a lot of stuff frm ppl bout' who they dislike hate and sometimes it's realli shocking. By juz lookin at how this person mingle wif the other, u may think tt they're on good terms, but in actual fact, they hate each other. U'll nvr know wad the other party truly feels bout' u and sometimes tt realli does sux! I juz hope tt ppl like Hongyue, Mal, fat pussy cat, lil' pig and some others are truly on good terms wif me and do not actually dislike or hate me.  We went to Popular after tt as Alvin wanted to get a Cd. He asked me to help him choose between Clay Aiken and some Chinese singer. Although I disliked Clay Aiken, I'm nvr gonna choose a Chinese singer. He asked the ppl there if he cld listen to both b4 deciding. They agreed and he asked me to listen to both. Clay Aiken was normal, but the song tt I listened frm tt Chinese singer was juz superb. It's been quite a while since I last listened to Chinese songs too. So he asked me again which one shld he buy. This time I said the Chinese one. L0L!  When I got home at around 5pm, I rested on my bed. My legs were aching and I couldn't walk properly. Yea, I was limping, probably due to the fact tt I had played floor ball in 2 consecutive days and fell down like 8 times. L0L! So I basically slacked for the rest of the day and chat on msn wif ppl. Well, guess tt's bout' it for today. Cya soon! =]

      Today, during P.E lesson we were allowed to play our own games. We could choose between soccer, basketball and floor ball. I actually wanted to play soccer, but in the end, I chose not to. Well, I haven been motivated or haf tt motivation to play soccer yet. Dun think I will anyway, so I decided to play floor ball instead. Well, it was smt like ice hockey as well, the sport which I like watching. Tt's why I chose it over soccer. There were gers as well as some guys playin floor ball, at least half the class. It was fun, but tiring, as there weren't any outs. It was continuous all the way. I managed to bag home 2 goals for my team as well. I dunnoe who won in the end, but it was fun and the feelin of scoring a goal is definitely wonderful. Perharps tt's why I chose not to play soccer, as I rarely get a chance to even touch the ball. So heck bout soccer rite now, there's so many other sports out there!  During Basics, we were playin taboo, a kindda game tt uses words to describe the given word. No actions are allowed, juz explaination. Each team had to select a person each time to explain the given word. We had a minute to do as many words as we could. I didnt go up as I was basically slackin and giving lame answers. L0L! In the end, we still managed to win every1 else. Yay!!! Hehe.  After sch, I went to lunch wif lil' pig at the coffee shop opposite ginza. At first fat pussy cat was walkin to the bus stop wif us, but in the end, he didnt come along. I dun even noe why either, kindda disappointed cuz he didnt even tell me tt he wasn't going.  When I got home, I did some of my A Maths homework. I couldn't complete it as it was too tough and my mind wasn't on studies. I was tired and basically thinkin of other stuff. So I decided to go online and slack. Well, fat pussy cat was online and he started talkin wif me. He claimed tt I owed him bloody tonnes of things and tt he wasn't gonna let me escape. L0L! He said I owe him 2 lunch treats, $20 and 2 pairs of soccer boots. Wad a greedy fat pussy cat! L0L! Well, he still owed me my b'dae present and it's like already 4 mths, reachin 5mths soon. L0L! *Sighz* So mean of him, last yr I gave him a present too and he didnt even bothered to gif me 1. *Sighz* *sobz* *sobz* I hafta say I'm disappointed of cuz. Although he did ask me wad I wanted, I told him to gif me a surprise. Well, obviously he couldn't be bothered. I'm not surprised at all. *Sighz*  Hmmm, the fat pussy cat even threatened me if I didn't gif him wad he wanted. He claimed tt he was gonna do more things other den lifting me up. L0L! I haf no idea why he loves lifting and carrying me. He did tt after sch today as well. He wouldn't let me off till I agreed to let him lift me up. L0L! When he actually lifted me up, he refused to put me down. I had to struggle outta his firm grip. L0L! The good thing is tt I felt safe when he carried me. Usually I will feel insecure when ppl lift me off the ground and carry me around. I didnt feel tt way when the fat pussy cat lifted me up though. He had a firm grip and juz made me felt safe and secured. Well, tt's much more like brothers ya? Hehe.  He asked me if he wanted him to gif me some excitement. I told him to come on and gimme his best shot. B4 I knew it, my hse phone rang and it was none other than the fat pussy cat himself. I was shocked, I dunnoe how the hell he got my hse number. Now tt was some scary shitz! He even told me over the phone tt he would do more than juz lift me up tmr. We put down the phone and continued talkin online. This was wad we chat about.  Me: u guai lan wif me, u can 4get bout hafing anything at all. F.P.C: :( Me: AND if u do anything STUPID to me tmr u can oso 4get bout' it. Me: Muahahahha wah not bad, can use to my advantage. F.P.C: wad a GOOD brother, threaten me. Me: no la, it's call PEACE TREATY. F.P.C: its call unfair treatment. Me: u expect me everiday let u whack me lift me throw me sit on me do stupid things to me IZZIT!? (tt's realli wad he does to me everi single day without fail. L0L!) F.P.C where got stupid? its a way to express our brotherhood. muahahha all brothers do that got which brothers dun do that ar? Me: oh, brothers whack each other ar? lift each other ar? throw each other ar? sit on each other ar? F.P.C: yup. Me: well, tt's probably 1 of ur weird imagination.  Haha, hope he isnt mad at me or anything. He's still my bro and I dun mind him doing anything to me. I was juz joking wif him. Hehe, Peace! Cya all~ =]

      I haf no idea why I felt totally exhausted and drained the whole day. I was yawning thru out the whole day. *Yawnz* Anyway, I 4got to bring my thermometer today and had to pay a fine of $1. Money wasn't the bad thing, the lectures by teacher after teacher was. Well after tt was 2 periods of F&N. I didnt understand a shitz tt the teachers were talkin about. All I got frm tt whole 2 periods was tt damn food experiment thing. I didnt even get the date! L0L!  After F&N was English, which was slack. We went thru the summary frm a compre passenge. Chemistry was also slack, we basically juz went thru 1 qn. Chinese was worse, I was staring blankly at the ceiling and the walls and anything tt I cld stared at.  After recess was Physics, SLACK! While I was waitin for the e maths teacher to arrive, I went to the sofa at the back of the cls to slack even more and fat pussy cat came tumbling over. He started pullin my ears and claimed tt I wrote nasty stuff bout' him in my blog. Since when did I ever do so? He's sucha gd liar man. L0L! The rest of the day was oso SLACK!  After sch, I went wif Mal for lunch at the hawker centre. Mr Chan came along after the while and started naggin tt we shldn't be late for focus blah blah blah. We told him we were going for F&N instead and he went on naggin. *Yawnz* When we got back to sch, we went to find the rest of the F&N ppl, but we couldn't. So, we decided to head back to cls for focus instead. In the end, Hongyue told us tt F&N would be after Focus. Yea yea, real shitz! Everything ended around 4:30pm. *Yawnz*  I went wif lil' pig and fat pussy cat to Clementi Interchange. On the bus to the interchange, fat pussy cat mentioned smt quite true "I seldom take bus wif u." Well, true cuz we live in 2 veri different areas. Tt's juz too bad, no wait, actually it's a gd thing for me! L0L! Haha, but he was rite bout' it and he still had the face to say! The reason is simple! It's cuz he doesn't spend quality time wif me! Fat Pussy Cat! Anyway, it was quite entertaining on the MRT wif lil' pig. He always has smt to say, so tt's a gd thing as I dislike startin a conversation. Therefore, hafing around is realli gd as he always start the conversation first. Hehe, tt's basically wad I like. He was askin me if I disliked this certain person, I said yes. Well, I told him not to tell any1 either, hopefully my secret is save. But he said tt he and fat pussy cat already knew it. This was how he said it "When we wif him, u always dun wanna mix wif us, like we got virus liddat." L0L! I told him tt there were still others I didnt quite like.  Well, I'm not a person who's hard to get along wif. I mean when I treat some1 in a certain way, there obviously a certain reason. When I ignore some1, means tt I dun feel comfortable talkin to tt person. When I simply keep quiet, means tt I'm either thinkin real hard or juz depressed. I dislike/hate ppl cuz of their character most of the time. I HATE ppl who 1.Disrespect others, 2.Are juz racist, 3.Backstabs others, 4.Gifs me a bad impression of them and 5.Shows me those kindda "guai lan" face & attitude. The 5th is the worst, tt pisses me of within a sec. I'll probably be like "Who da hell do ya think ya r!?" My relationship wif some1 at first cld be best frens, but after he gives me tt face or/& attitude, we'll be known as ENEMIES. The other 4 are oso wad I truly hate.  In cls, most ppl dun treat me well at all. Actually I can say every1 except most of the gers and not more than 3 guys. They juz dunnoe my limit, they dunnoe when to stop, they juz keep going on and on and on and on and on. *Yawnz* Pathetic Fools. Tt's wad those ppl actually are. Well, I'm exhausted rite now and I wanna haf an early nite. So I guess this is gdbye~! Cya~ =]

      I was nearly late for school today, luckily, I managed to get a cab and get to school on time. 2 buses came, but both were packed and 3 taxis came wif the green signal, but apparently all 3 had passengers. Well, praise the lords tt I managed to catch a cab and got to school on time, if not I'll probably be swearing rite now. L0L!  The first period of the day was English. I was the first to be selected to present the first 3 answers to the class. -.=" Well, b4 I could started crapping, the teacher gave a scolding to those who did not do their work. It was kindda sad, especially when the poor lil' pig and fat pussy cat were among those ppl. Well, but they obviously couldn't be bothered. Haha. See, I care so much bout' my brothers unlike them! Hmmph~!  E Maths was pretty quiet, the ppl frm 4E4 weren't around as they went for the health screening. So it was pretty slack as well. Physics was after that and I couldn't understand tt chapter. I had a hard time paying attention as well. Haha. After recess was Social Studies for 2 periods. It was slack, all we needed to do was get into grps and write some stuff bout' Venice. Chinese was next, but obviously I wasn't paying attention at all. He was basically talking nonsense and wasting time. After tt he made us do our own work. Wad a lazy teacher man! Not as if I care anyway! L0L!  The last period was assembly in the hall. We watched some realli stupid cartoon, tt was Lame wif a capital L. A total waste of time. I went to haf lunch at the hawker centre wif Malbindar after school. We had focus at 2:30pm till 4:30pm. So we had to haf a quick lunch and rushed back to school as quickly as possible. We were onli like 5mins late.  About half the class didnt go, not surprised at all. L0L! Among those tt didnt go was lil' piggy~ Man is he lazy! L0L! I dunnoe, probably had tuition or something, well hopefully it was tuition. How could he skipped focus!? L0L! Not as if it would help out a lot attending focus. Haha. I managed to concentrate for onli like half an hour. After tt was juz slackin, talkin and wastin time.   Fat pussy cat was mean as usual! He was pulling my hair and tucking the collar of my shirt! L0L! He still said tt I was the mean one. Why? Cuz I call him a fat pussy cat. Let's see, he calls me a white stick, a P.O.W, a Skinny Stubborn Stick and many more, so who is more mean? He said I didnt tell him stuff tt I tell Mal and Hongyue. Well, tt's not cuz I'm mean or dun trust him. I juz cuz tt recently, it seems to me tt he doesn't wanna mix wif me or something and I can't find time to tell him stuff too cuz it seems to me tt he's not interested. Well, he oso said tt I was mean as I treat him in a veri bad manner. I didnt haf anything to say after tt. Honestly, in the whole cls, I treat him the betta than most ppl. I care for him and love him as a brother, and apparently he still said tt I was mean towards me. *Sighz* Wad a F.P.C!  After fat pussy cat was tired of pulling my hair and tucking my collar, he went on to stroke me. -.=" Well, it may sound gay, but he looked so damn adorable and sincere while he was doing tt. Juz like a caring and loving lil' bro(about time eh?) Haha. Tt's wad I call Brotherly Love! Wahahaha! I dun think it's a bad thing, I actually think it's a good thing as long as it doesn't turn into some gay act. L0L!   After focus both of us were walkin juz outside the 4th storey toilet. When I realised my hair had been contaminated due to the pulling from tt fat pussy cat, I started to say some stuff. As u all shld noe by now, fat pussy cat is onli good in giving stupid comments and tt's exactly wad he did. I stared at him at first den approached him and put my arm around his neck. I intended to strangle tt lil' !@#$%^&, but b4 I knew it, my legs were off the ground! Damnit!   Tt fat pussy cat actually lifted me off the ground! OMG! He used 1 arm to support my head and the other to support my legs. Man was I shocked cuz I didn't expect tt kindda shitz to happen! It's either 1. He's strong or 2. I'm light. Well, if u picked option 1, I must tell u politely to use ur brains, as u all noe he's F-A-T! Now wad does F-A-T means? Yea, basically FAT! If u picked option 2, u haf brains man! But dun get it wrong. Light stands for thin, but not skinny alrite! Nah, juz kidding. I hafta admit tt he's strong ya! (so dun say I nvr write good thing bout' u! cuz I juz did!) The bad thing was tt once he lifted me up, he refused to put me down. He was carrying me and walkin all the way to the stairs. Luckily nobody was around, cuz it's Embarrassing wif a capital E! It made me look like a weakling, as if I'm so weak till I can't walk. -.=" Well, as u all noe, I'm Neo, the 1, so somehow I managed to get out of the situation and kept a distance frm tt dangerous fat pussy cat!  Tt fat pussy cat forced me to take a cab home. As u all noe, I'm a veri nice person unlike SOME ppl, so I agreed without much hesitation. He kept calling me "Brother Bear" while we were waitin for the cab. I haf no idea why he did so too, yes he's my lil' bro. But a bear? Well, I think he's more suitable to be the bear as he's as around as 1. L0L! In the cab, he said tt he couldn't pay as he was saving money to buy a pair of soccer boots. I told him "I buy for u la." den he said as he was alighting frm the cab "I tell u frm MSN tonite." Well, he didn't say anything. So tt's juz too bad, my offer to him is now officially over. L0L! I was supposed to treat him to lunch today as well due to some deal, but luckily I sneaked away. So technically I dun owe him any treats anymore! Yay! L0L! Alrite den, PEACE my brother! =P~~~ Tt's bout' it for the happenings today, cya! =]

      I watched the Euro '04 Finals between Greece and Portugal early in the morning today. Greece turned out to be the victors in the end wif a scoreline of 1-0. To me, it was simply bullshit. I do not believe a team frm nowhere, who had nvr taken part in big tournaments, who were the most underdogs of the underdogs, could turned out to be the winners. Tt's juz bullshitz! I was frustrated and juz pissed bout' it. I honestly felt tt Greece was juz plain lucky. To defeat big teams like France, Czech Republic and Portugal, to draw wif a rather good team like Spain and to lose to a lousy team like Russia, now doesn't tt sound fake? Well, it definitely does to me.  I went to watch Spider Man 2 at West Mall in the afternoon wif some frens. We actually wanted to catch the 3:30pm slot. Well, we were in the queue like 3:15pm all the way to 3:45pm. The queue was so damn long, it was like all the way to the "Yellow" shop. Well, when it was our turn to get tickets, both 3:30pm as well as 4:00pm timeslot were fully taken. So we decided to get the 4:30pm timeslot. There were also many seats already taken up and we didnt manage to get good seats. The movie lasted for 2hrs, it was pretty alrite for me. I wasn't realli blown away, so I'll juz say tt it was average. I would recommand this movie to my frens though.  There were some already movies that I wanted to watch. First, The Notebook, but I think tt it's already over. Hopefully, I still get the change to watch it. Second is King Arthur, I'm definitely gonna catch it wif some of my frens. Finally, Brotherhood, a Korean movie tt I realli wanna watch too. I hope my frens would ask me out to watch it.  After the movie, I went to popular and picked up some stuffs b4 heading home for dinner. I took a shower after dinner b4 starting on my F&N coursework evaluation. I worked all the way frm 8pm to 9:30pm. Luckily I managed to complete it as the deadline is tmr. Haha, well I guess tt's 'bout it. Anyway I would like to ask if any1 is interested to go watch King Arthur and Brotherhood wif me? If u r, pls lemme noe alrite? The earlier the betta ya? If no money, at most I treat u la! Haha, alrite, I'll stop here for now. Cya~ =]

      I'm so damn proud of myself man. Today I managed to complete most of my assignments except for my F&N Evaluation. I'll probably do tt tmr. I basically spent the whole day workin on my assignments. I woke up like 11:30am, feelin giddy and uncomfortable, but I juz did my work and the giddyness soon left.  In the evening, I went to West Mall to get some stuff. It took me like 1.5 hrs as I was browsing thru some things and lookin out for some stuff. I reached home like 6:30pm, den I realised tt I had 4got to get something. Tt was the Geography TYS. Oh man! Now I'll probably hafta head down to popular once again b4 thurs.  I bought this Vcd titled "Beyond Borders". It was a damn touchin film man. It was basically about this women who had a pampered life in London. She collides with the stark realities of poverty and hunger in the world's most dangerous hot spots. The show is juz magnificent! It's definitely a must watch!  I cancelled my tuition tmr so tt I could catch the match tmr morning. After losing $400 in 2 days, I decided not to bet on this game. Overall I still made some $600 shitz and I'm not gonna put it on the line. I'm currently findin ppl to watch spider man 2 wif me tmr. !@#$%^& can't seem to find any1 yet. Actually they're others I could haf called, but I decided not to. So I definitely will watch it tmr without a doubt, but whoeva the person I'm watchin it wif, I haf no idea. Hopefully, a gal if possible. L0L! If not possibly a close fren. Hmmm, now a close fren sounds more practical cuz I can play pool wif tt person or something. Haha, well I'll stop here for now. Cya~ =]

      Today was the 'o' lvl chinese listening exam. It was Chinese, so u shld noe wad the outcome is. Well, it wasn't tt bad, but den again, I've got many different answers wif my frens. Well, I juz hope to pass, tt's bout' it. After tt, I was pretty tired. So I decided to go home first.  When I got home, I basically juz slacked, rested and ate my lunch. I wanted to take a nap, but I decided to go out instead. I went to play pool for about 3hrs wif a fren. After tt we had dinner and proceeded to boon lay interchange, where there was a pasam malam going on. We walked around for awhile and den went home. I dropped by West Mall to get some stuffs first before heading home.  There's this korean movie tt I realli wanna watch. It opens on 15th July and I simply can't wait for it. The title is "Brotherhood". It juz seems to be a realli interesting warfare movie. I hafta catch tt movie even if I hafta watch it alone or treat some1 to watch it. Hopefully I'll be able to go wif tt special some1 to watch it.  I felt pretty left out the past few days, tt's y I'm kindda depressed. Well, I dunnoe wad's the reason for them to do this, tt juz makes me upset. They're treatin me like an outcast and tt realli sucks. Guess I'll stop here for today. Cya~

      E Maths was the first period of the day. I was able to focus as I was sittin at the back alone wif Nizam, who was veri quiet thruout the lesson. He seems to be concentrating too. Haha, so far so gd, I hope I can continue focusing for the rest of the year.  P.E was next. I didn't wear my pe shirt and shorts cuz I had a headache when I woke up today, so I decided not to take P.E. Mr Lim said tt for this whole term, we are allow to play any games tt we want. So I guess tt I'll be slacking everi P.E lesson frm now onwards. Well I dun think I wanna play soccer anymore, kindda lost confidence and interest in it already. If some1 motivates me to start again, den perharps I might.  The rest of the day was pretty slack. I did pay attention in everi lesson today except chinese, so tt's pretty gd for me already. Wow! After school, I went to Hongyue and Malbindar to Ginza to haf lunch at Sakura. In the restaurant, I learnt some realli interesting and at tt the same time sad stuffs, but I'm not gonna disclose anything here. If u wanna noe, cum ask me personally. Anyway, the bill was like $30.20.  The English workshop was alrite, but I was realli exhausted. I tried my best to keep focus and pay attention for juz one and a half hrs. Well, I hope tt this workshop will improve my English and allow me to get an A for the 'O' Lvls. Yea, guess tt's bout' it, I'm juz too tired to carry on. I still hafta save energy to watch The Bachelor later on. Alrite den. Ciao and Cya yall. =]

      The day was pretty alrite. It started off wif A Maths. Mr Lee Han Seng was our new teacher for those who got below 35 for mid-yr. He's not bad, seriously, I managed to pay attention during those 2 periods for the first time in like a yr plus. I also did the homework I was given. Haha, well tt's a start since a yr. Will it pay off in the end? Nah! L0L!  For Social Studies, this new teacher replaced Mrs Zamree and was pretty alrite I suppose. She doesn't seem to haf control of the class though, den again, who does? Not many, tt's 4 sure. After S.S was Geography and we all had to go to the hall. There was this banding system tt was gonna take place for all the sec 4 express. We were going to be split to 3 classes. The first class would be in 4E1, second in 4E2 and third in 4E3. Only Eddy and Alvin got into the first class. Some went into the second and most in the third class. Malbindar and lil' pig were in the third class. Unfortunately, I was in the second class. I wanted to change class, not cuz of my frens, but cuz of the teachers. Mrs Ng took the third class and Mr Leong took my class. I kindda understand and do betta when Mrs Ng teaches me. In the end, I swapped wif Abbas as he preferred Mr Leong's style of teaching and wanted to get to my class.  During P.E, the whole cls couldn't find the damn teacher, so all of us juz went our own way. Some went for an early recess, some went back to cls and I dunnoe where da hell the rest went. L0L!  After recess was Basics, which was pretty cool. It was basically a slack lesson and there wasn't much to do. After 2 periods, we had to go for our health screening in the art room. When we got there, there were still other ppl in there, so we had to wait outside. I was squating outside the back door of the cls room. Fat pussy cat came along and wad do u noe? He planted his fat balloon-liked ass on my rite leg. He's realli some heavy shit man. After awhile I was in a sitting position and he was enjoyin it. He obviously doesn't noe how FAT he is! L0L! He kept bouncing as well, but luckily he got up after 5mins. If he would haf sat longer, my rite leg would haf decomposed due to his fat stinky ass! L0L! So I'll definitely consider myself lucky, and furthermore, I'm lucky tt it's the leg and not anywhere else. Hopefully he doesn't do anything to me wif tt ass of his anymore and hopefully he doesn't read this. L0L!  The health screening started off wif the eye checkup, which was my fav as I haf a perfect vision. L0L! Den came the blood pressure thing, the nurse who took mine said it was high, but later on another nurse said it wasn't high, but it was good. So I'm pretty lost, but I dun care bout' tt. The best thing was tt the nurse said I WAS skinny, but not anymore! So guys, get it straight, I'm NOT skinny! Haha, my clsmates wasted time in the art room so we didnt haf to go for Chinese. When we got back to cls, there wasn't any teacher, so we slacked till the end of the day.  All the sec 4 express classes had to attend some maths briefing immediately after sch. It lasted for like 15mins. Mr Lee Han Seng was juz like tellin us not to skip focus and stuffs. I wasn't realli paying attention, but the bottomline was tt we are not suppose to skip focus anymore unless we haf a valid reason. After tt, Me and Malbindar went to the hawker centre for lunch. Some of my clsmates joined us and at tt point I felt kindda uncomfortable, so I ate my food fast and both me and Mal left b4 any1 else cld do so. Lil piggy told me he was gonna take 176, but I didn't want to due to certain reason, so I juz said I had to go. I feel pretty guilty bout' it, so sorry my dear brother. Why I felt uncomfortable and wad was tt certain reason? Unbreak the code below to find out.  Code: Ic HoO sE2 lE@v EwHeN mYeNeM yIsS pOt tEd!  Alrite, I'll stop here for today. Cya all nxt time and whoeva manages to break the code, try to do smt bout' it ya? =]
