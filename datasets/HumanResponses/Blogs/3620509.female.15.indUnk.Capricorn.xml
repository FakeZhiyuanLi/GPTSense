      hmm.. well hello.. i guess today was alright.. meh i'm still not feeling very happy.. it sucks quite a bit.. i went over to sukis with my brother to watch a movie.. we rented "Duplex" it was pretty good.. then we just hung out.. his little sister was being really nice to me.. and she gave me a hug.. twas odd.. meh.. then.. after that we went to pick up Rory from his girlfriends house.. i swear to god.. rory was jerking off in the car.. i could hear it.. but i didnt want to look.. i was in denial.. it was VERY strange.. ugh.. anyways i need to block that out of my memory right now. Umm okay its gone.. anyways.. hmm yeah.. then i got home.. went on the computer.. and guess what i'm still here.. god i'm so pathetic.. some person said my life was pathetic.. and told me i should go kill myself.. it was very nice.. heh.. yeah.. i'm somewhat tempted to take her advice.. but i probably don't have the guts to do it anymore.. oh well i guess thats a good thing.. hmmm so.. yeah.. thats all i wish i were drunk.. good day -lots of love and saliva, kira

      ugh.. depression.. it gnaws at your fucking soul.. and there's nothing you can do about it. everything is so fucked up.. i don't want to be here anymore.. it doesn't make any sense.. nothing does.. i just want to sleep and never wake up.. this world would probably be a better place without me.. its not like i contribute to it in any way.. i just use up resources.. I'm not useful in any way.. It's so sad when you have no one to talk to .. i can't relate to anyone.. i feel so alone.  I don't know what to do.. -sigh-.. oh well i'll sleep it off i guess..  goodbye.

      hey hey! what a day.. today was awesome.. it was STACEYS 16TH BIRTHDAY annnd midsummers eve.. it was great... stacey and i did so much.. we went to the mall and to the beach and celebrated midsummers eve.. it was darn fun!! So yes at the mall stacey had to buy a bathing suit.. and i had to run to roots and get us two shirts.. one says tree hugger (mine) and the other says happy camper (staceys) and they rule. After that my dad drove us to Gyro Park we laid in the sun... for a few hours.. and ate food... and tried going in the water but remembered we have a fear of jelly fish.. and there were two in there so we ran away..  We realized we were being watched by strange perverted men.. men whom we didnt KNOW!! anyways.. yeah.. they were creepy.. and they watched us as we were getting ready to go .. they were sitting on a bench.. DAMN MEN AND THEIR STUPIDNESS!! and yes.. after that we went and changed in the bathroom but i found that my bottle had somehow burst into a million pieces.. and everything was soaking wet in my bag.. soo i had to wear staceys shorts.. and yes.. it was poopy.. we also took pictures! after that we were sitting on a bench waiting for my dad to come.. there were these odd asian mafia dudes sitting behind us and one of them farted REALLY FUCKING LOUD.. and i wanted to yell .. "YOU'RE DISGUSTING" but i did not because i thought they might kill me.. annnnnnndd yesss... then we came back to my house and walked to get some chinese food which was darn good.. and then we went to catch the bus home.. and some strange dude said "nice ass" so i shook my fist at him and yelled "YOU BASTARD!!!!" and stacey and i just yelled at them.. then we came home.. and went out with candles at a blanket.. to celebrate midsummers even.. we put wax EVERYWHERE.. and thenn when it got dark we decided to walk back..  as we were walking back we took some cool pictures.. one was odd.. i think we took a picture of a ghost.. but yes.. thats about all we did today and it was AWESOME.. anyways.. im going to go watch lost in translation again.. gooday. -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Today was awesome.. a great way to end the school year and start the summer... stacey and i hung out.. I met her after school.. she bussed to my house and i met her down the street.. then we came back to my house.. we had to wait for my dad to get home so we could drive down to the zone radio station to pick up my movie pass i won to see Fahrenheit 9/11, we went to the park but the grass was too prickly so we came back to my house and decided to start watching Donnie Darko.. My dad came home.. it was SCORCHING hot today.. we went to the place and picked up the ticket.. i asked my dad to pick up some pizza.. soo we did..YAY.. and chocolate milk which was darn delicious.. we went to go pick up my mom at work.. there were these clouds coming in and it was starting to get really windy.. i kept thinking we were gonna have a twister.. lol so.. my dad went into the hotel to wait for my mom.. stacey and i were getting really over heated and delusional lol we were sitting in the car sweating and laughing sooo hard.. we started singing songs in opera voices.. and we sang the munchkins song from the wizard of oz movie..  and stacey was singing really really loud.. and this lady in the other car was looking at us.. and stacey blew her a kiss hahah.. there was this moth wing in the car.. and stacey and i were freaking out.. stacey like came over.. and she was holding me so tight lol it was soo funny.. i was like dying because it was sooo warm.. it was soo windy and stacey said there were ashes on her she said it looked like mount saint helen blew up lol so yeah we sat in the car for a half an hour laughing and talking.. yah .. it was fun.. then we came home.. and had pizza.. my family was fighting and i was getting all mad at them so stacey and i went upstairs.. We fell asleep on my bed for like an hour or so.. and when we woke up we were sooo hot.. cuz the door in my room was closed.. and we had no fan.. we were soo warm.. that we were just sitting there laughing.. i like fell on the floor laughing so hard.. i dont even remember what we were saying but it was sooo retarded.. we were so parched.. we were just lying on my bed.. stacey started like having a seizure hahahah it was sooo funny.. she was just twitching and hitting my bed hahah (she wasnt actually having a seizure) i got the hiccups really bad.. and i was like whimpering.. laughing.. dying and hiccuping all at the same time lol then we got some water.. and went outside and ran around in the hose and then we went to the park and laid in the grass.. which was darn funnn and there were some random guys like 20 feet away just smoking weed in the field.. it was funny "You think you know but you have no idea.. the diary of random guys" hahahah but yes.. hmm after that we came back to the house and watched the rest of donnie darko and thennn we walked to the hyacinth and sat around for a while talking about fate.. and sluts.. annd then w estarted getting attacked by bugs so we started walking home.. on the way down my street we saw something in the middle of the road that looked like a dead animal stacey was about to pass out.. so we started walking towards it.. and we were scared that it was a cat.. we were right in front of it.. and it still looked like a dead animal.. so then i wanted to figure what it was so i started going towards it.. stacey decided to come with me even though she was so freaked out.. i was worried it was a cat.. whcih is why i wanted to see it.. cuz if it was someones cat i wanted to tell them.. we neared it.. and then.. it was a branch.. hahaha we were laughing so hard.. but seriously it actually looked like a dead animal from afar.. it looked like it had legs a tail and a head and fur and everyone.. it was also dark.. and maybe we spent too long in the sun today.. but it was the scariest thing ever.. but yes.. we took a piece of the branch to put into our scrap book.. that shall be started soon enough.. anyways.. that ended our day.. staceys still here.. but shes going home in a few mins. Sooo this was a damn long entry.. so i'll end it now lol bye bye -lots of love and saliva, kira

      hello.. so.. its 2 in the morning.. i can't stop thinking about.. "relationships" and how i'm so afraid of commitment.. It's really hard.. when you can't express yourself properly.. I feel really vulnerable when i tell someone how i feel.. which is why i dont do it.. i feel like if i dont.. it wont hurt so bad when it doesn't work out which is stupid i know but its how i feel.. it seems like relationships are really pointless.. when i know it will never turn out right anyways.. I'll always get hurt.. no matter what. Guys always seem nice in the beginning and i feel like they're like that just so they can get what they want.. when they have it.. they don't want it so much anymore.. I guess im really pessimistic about the whole thing.. but its hard for me to think any other way .. when every other "relationship" i've been in has turned out VERY bad.. I haven't really been treated well by men.. so its a scarey place for me to be when once again i know theres a possibility that im going to get fucked over... man i make no sense.. im just an idiot.. i need to sleep.. i hope jem gets a job tomorrow. anyways im off to bed.. night night -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Yah so, as the title explains.. I got ditched again.. Which fucking sucks.. So yah.. I'm bored. I don't even know why I'm writing.. I guess its because I have nothing better to do anyways. Bleh.. So.. I think that spider laid spider eggs in my bathroom because last night there were two baby spiders crawling on me.. And when I was in the shower there was another one crawling on the shower curtain.. My house is infested with bugs.. Its pretty disgusting.. I don't even want to imagine how many bugs I could have eaten in my sleep... oy.. Gross.. But yah.. sooo.. What to do today.. Guess I'll just watch finding nemo or something.. Or go back to bed one or the other.. mmhmm! Life is grand.. Yep yep.. Okay I'm going now.. C-ya -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Well.. Okay so I transferred all my stuff onto this.. Because I'm sick of my layout.. And I need some change.. At the moment i'm talking to good ol jem.. He's the coolest guy ever.. And stacey is the coolest girl ever.. Well today was a boring day.. I went tanning.. And then I came home.. And pretty much just talked to jem, then I had to go to the doctor.. I was having some major chest pains.. And yesterday I had an anxiety attack.. I went to the hospital but the emergency was way to busy.. Darn nabit.. So I went home and I still thought I was going to die.. The doctor I spoke too today prescribed me with some pills and told me I should get some counseling and learn some breathing techniques. But yes.. That was my day.. Now IM sitting here... Still talking to jem.. Damn we talk a lot.. And yeah.. I'm hoping its sunny tomorrow so I can be happier.. And that is all good day -lots of love and saliva, kira

If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience I will dispense this advice now. Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You’re not as fat as you imagine.   Don’t worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.   Do one thing everyday that scares you   Sing Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts, don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.   Floss   Don’t waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind the race is long, and in the end, it’s only with yourself.   Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.   Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.   Stretch   Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life the most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don’t.   Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees, you’ll miss them when they’re gone.   Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t, maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary what ever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either your choices are half chance, so are everybody else’s. Enjoy your body, use it every way you can don’t be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, it’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own..   Dance even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room. Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them. Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly. Get to know your parents, you never know when they’ll be gone for good.   Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.   Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography in lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.   Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.   Travel.   Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do you’ll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.   Respect your elders.   Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.   Don’t mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.   Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and selling it for more than it’s worth.

Mr. Bean's guide to fun in an elevator... 1) When there's only one other person in the elevator, tap them on the shoulder and then pretend it isn't you. 2) Push the buttons and pretend they give you a shock. Smile, and go back for more. 3) Ask if you can push the button for other people, but push the wrong ones. 4) Call the Psychic Hotline from your cell phone and ask if they know what floor you're on. 5) Hold the doors open and say you're waiting for your friend. After a while, let the doors close and say: "Hi Greg. How's your day been?" 6) Drop a pen and wait until someone reaches to help pick it up, then scream: "That's mine!" 7) Bring a camera and take pictures of everyone in the elevator. 8) Move your desk in to the elevator and whenever someone gets on, ask if they have an appointment. 9) Lay down a Twister mat and ask people if they'd like to play. 10) Leave a box in the corner, and when someone gets on ask them if they hear something ticking. 11) Pretend you are a flight attendant and review emergency procedures and exits with the passengers. 12) Ask: "Did you feel that?" 13) Stand really close to someone, sniffing them occasionally. 14) When the doors close, announce to the others: "It's okay. Don't panic, they open up again." 15) Swat at flies that don't exist. 16) Tell people that you can see their aura. 17) Call out: "group hug!" - then enforce it. 18) Grimace painfully while smacking your forehead and muttering: "Shut up, all of you, just shut up!" 19) Crack open your briefcase or purse, and while peering inside, ask Hey Little guy, you got enough air in there?" 20) Stand silently and motionless in the corner, facing the wall, without getting off. 21) Stare at another passenger for a while, then announce in horror "You're one of THEM aren't you!" and back away slowly. 22) Wear a puppet on your hand and use it to talk to the other passengers.

I became addicted to pain that didn`t hurt, but instead felt nice. I engraved into my soul, on my soft flesh, with the silver blade, making deep imprints. The complex emotions leaked from my flesh in the form of blood, rather from my eyes in the form of tears. One cut followed by another, and another. The world seemed to blur and slow down, as the cuts left me calm. As I watched the crimsom tears slowly drip out of me.    Every thought and every second that you smile, it makes me choke, it makes me bleed, they were all lies. Your smile makes me sick  --- - ------------------------- - - ----- ------ ++++++++++ ++ + ++++++ ---- -- -- - It¡¯s so hard to say "I love you", and to draw back the tears. To know that you¡¯re not there to help me face my fears. To know the phone¡¯s at reach, but I cannot hear your voice. To see you laughing when I`m crying deep inside. To just find feelings and not have to make them hide. Its so hard to live without you, when I need you more then words. I want to scream how much I love you but hold back and not be heard. Its so hard to go to sleepat night when I cannot dream of you. Its so hard to think that you might fall in love with someone new. To start crying when I hear your favorite song, to sit and wonder, where did i go wrong? It`s so hard to live without you ifonly I would have known I willnever love another, I would rather be alone.  **LoVe KiRa**   Ranted: Jan.8th 2004 Feeling:headachy hey..well today was quite the weird day.. i wouldnt say it was bad.. just VERY frustrating. my parents were being bitches and threatening to get me a drug test and such.. and just being all around mean to me today.. and then i found out that my brother and his girlfriend of 5 years were breaking up and they have 3 children together so i donno why she'd just kick him out like that she said she didntlove him anymore and stuff.. fuck if eel bad for him.. but ya so since i was upset tonite cam asked if i wanted to go to a movie and i did and i had a VERY quick shower and igot ready soo fast.. faster than i usually do lol but we sill missed themovie.. i saw heather downtown.. dealing sum dope.. annnd i gave my weed to sum homeless guy on the street who asked cam if he had any.. soo woot dont ifeel good about that.. umm yes so we missed the movie i got a pizza and then we went and rented bowlingfor columbine.. grr.. isaw sum realllly stupid lookin girl who were wearing huge pink jackets with FUR im gonna kill em i truely am... hmm yesso we watched that movie and it was coool for the 3rd time . a nnd thenn i got a cab home and the cab driver and i had a cool conversation about insane genouises annd theni got home and got into a big fight with my parents and i ended up with a migrane .. cuz their mean.. but cha that was my day.. woot but alas cam mademe feel better soo im happy now cam rocks.. anyways i shall go now bye bye  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Jan.6th 2004 Feeling:booorrreeddd ello.. this not sleeping thing has REALLY REALLY gotta stop its 3 16am.. and no ones online well.. no one i wanna talk to.. well okay nevermind i just never message people.. anyways..im bored.. i just watched finding nemo again.. and tonite i went to see lord of the rings return of the king with my family.. this was my 4th time watching it.. omg.. after seeing it 4 times it gets DAM boring.. hmm well..theres a movie i REALLY wanna see its called "THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT" ashton kutchers in it.. and it looks really gawd dam good so everyone go down to the movies on january 23rd and support the movie! cuz i sure will be lol i hope.. soo tonite i tried this skateboarding game at silvercity.. annd i really sucked.. and soo did the game.. and there were hot guys there.. and i was with my family lol it was kind embaressing but i guess its good to spend time with the family.. i mean i usually dont get embaressed when i go out with my parents.. like shopping or whatever.. but i donno.. it was just embaressing tonite for sum straaange reason.. dam i wish sumone cool was on msn.. oh YAH guess what?!!?

Why is it when you think you are moving forward the world seems to stop.. and you become motionless within its walls. Some say everything happens for a reason.. and so i ask them this, is that just somthing you tell yourself in order for you to feel better about the status that your life is in? Even kharma.. do some people really beleive that we get whats coming to us?? That if we do good only good can come out of it and vice versa , but why is that people who do deserve a break never get one?? Life and way it works is 50% effort, and the rest.. is just luck..  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.12th 2003 Feeling:dead I cant do this alone.. i need u now.. why cant u need me too.. i just wanna run my fingers through ur soft dark hair.. i want u to kiss me and tell me it was all a bad dream.. tell me everythings gonna be okay.. i want u here with me.. i wanna hold u.. i wanna need u.. i wanna love you... i just wanna die.. moving on is one of the hardest things to do.. whyd u make me love u.. whyd u make me care.. now im just hurt and alone... with no one who cares... i have no one to talk to but my lonely self... but there is no comfort there.. only emptyness.. darkness.. i need u.. i need u to keep me sane... to talk sum sense into my mind.. my thoughts are lingering to dangerous places... im drowning in despair, please save me..these waters are cold.. i need u..  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.11th 2003 Feeling:lonely I can only do what i do, when im alone. Is that why ive been pushing many out of my life? Living in my own world, of which ive called darknessfor so long. How i long for a simple release. But please, i do not need you to save me. What i need is... hm im still trying to figure that out myself..   A simple reflection... I would look bak at the memories weve shared, memories evgraved in my soul and cry. Bringing back all the pain was one of the most wounding things i could have done to myself. I learned that i was only doing this to myself. The memories had nothing to do with it. Perhaps it was becuz i couldnt learn to just accept. Nor quite understand the concepts of life. That we all live with the obstacles and barriers, to just find it in yourself to fight through, and now, when i look back, pain is no longer, tears fall but i smile.   Breath... Do you ever feel like the whole world is against you. You breath only because your body craves for oxygen, but wish itd be your last. You wake up in the morning, only because life makes you. Making it so difficult for every day,hour,minute,second to pass by. I breath only because i have to...   inhale....exhale...repeat...  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.11th 2003 Feeling:alrite well hello.. today was quite good.. i guess lol i went to the library to do sum school work and got a book.. i wanted to do sum volunteer work so i asked the lady at the desk if there was any.. she said there wasnt but she told me to apply as a Paige so i could get payed instead of volunteering so.. next week or sumthing im gonna go downtown and apply at the library there.. i needa make a resume and stuff and this guy i know said hed help me with it cuz hes all smart and shit lol and yah .. wow imagine that kira getting a job how crazy is that... well i thot i mite need a job since both my parents dont have ne right now and so now i can just pay for my own clothes and food etc.. cuz our family is having a hard time.. tonite my parents were talking about getting a divource because of money problems and too much fighting around the house so i ended up crying most of the night.. but o well.. im sure everything will be JUST FINE but yah neways i should get going its 2 in the morning and yah im tired so bye bye all u cool people :D  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.8th 2003 Feeling:tired well hello as u can see theres a new layout.. the buttons for the links are kinda ugly but whatever its different..umm today i did nuthing i went out for dinner with my family and then made sum christmas center peices.. i wish id dont sum more stuff or stayed out longer cuz now im just bored and back to having my thoughts on stupid stuff that wont go away gr.. it makes me so sad... and frustrated but neways i dont have much to say.. but hey cam ur cool lol now u can feel special too bye bye  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.5th 2003 Feeling:rejected *sigh* hello.. i dont even know why im writing right now... i dont have much to say at all but i wish i was on E rite now.. then i could be happy.. but im not, so sadly here i sit surrendering to my lonely depression... it hurts so bad.. if only the pain would subside then maybe i could find sum peace..but as i can see for now this is what im gonna be feeling for quite sumtime.. used..torn..confused..depressed..dead.. left alone left to wither away left to wonder what i could have done better... i need a release... i need to run away frum the pain why wont it end..all i do is think of u.. and how u were so cruel and never loved me in the first place.. i was blind to think u actully felt as much for me as i did for u.. fuck you..  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted: Dec.4th 2003 Feeling:sad/pissed off Do guys truly only think about sex and fucking people and getting sumone???

Words didnt seem to work they lied when they came out of your mouth you tried so hard to understand them, you wanted to be part of what was happening, u saw them having fun and it seemed like such a mystery, almost magic. Made you think there was somthing wrong with you, youd look in the mirror tryna find it, you thot u were ugly and everyone was looking at you so, you learned to be invisible to look down, to avoid conversation. The hours, days, weekends, the weekend nites alone, where were you? In the basement? In the attic? In your room ...? Working sum job just to have sumthing to do, just to have a place to put yourself, just to have a way to get away frum THEM, a chance to get away frum the ones who made u feel so strange and ill at ease inside yourself... Did you ever get invited to one of their parties? You sat and wondered if you'd go or not, for hours you'd imagine the scenarios that might transpire, if they would laugh at you, if u would know what to do, if u had the right things on, if they would notice that u came frum a different planet. Did you get all brave in your thots like u were gonna go in there and deal with it and have a great time? Did u think that you mite be the life of the party, and all these people were gonna talk to you and you'd find out you were wrong and that you had a lot of friends and you werent so strange after all... Did you end up going? Did they mess with you? Did they single u out? Did u find out u were only invited becuz they thot u were so weird.... Yah i think i know you.. You spent alot of time full of hate... a hate that was pure as sunshine, a hate that saw for miles, a hate that kept you up at night, a hate that filled your every wakeing moment, a hate that carried you for a long time... Yes i think i know you, You couldnt figure out what they saw in the way they lived... home was not home, your room was home, a corner was home, the place they werent THAT was home.. I know you... your sensitive and you hide it cuz u fear of getting stepped on one more time, it seems that when you show a part of yourself that is the least bit vulnerable.. sumone takes advantage of you.. one of THEM steps on you, they mistake kindness for weakness, but u know the difference, you've been the brunt of their weakness for years, and strength is sumthing that u know a bit about cuz u had to be strong to keep yourself alive, you know yourself very well now and u dont trust people.. u no them to well, u try to find that special person.. sumone u could be with, sumone you could touch, sumone u can talk too, sumone u wont feel so strange around. But you found that they dont really exist, u feel closer to people on movie screens... Yah i think i know you, You spend alot of time daydreaming, and people have made comment to that effect telling you your self involved and self centered, but they dont know do they? About the long night shifts alone, about the years of keeping yourself company, all the nights u wrapped your arms around yourself so you could imagine sumone holding you... the hours of indecision, self dought, the intense depression, the blinding hate... the rage that made you stagger, the devastation of rejection... Well, maybe they do know but if they do... they shure do a good job of hiding it. It astounds you how they can be sooo smooth, how they seem to pass through life as if life itself were some divine gift, and it inferiates you to watch yourself with your apparant skill in finding every way possible to screw it up... Yah, for you life is a long trip ,terrifying and wonderful... Birds sing to you at night, the rain and the sun, the changing seasons are true friends solitude is a hard one alli faithful and patient.. Yah.. i think i know you..  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 14th 2003 Feeling:sad and depressed..   hello.. today was gay i was sposed to go out with sumone but i didnt really feel like it and i had to do sum work so i didnt.. ive had this headache for the longest time and it wont go away.. the dentist says its cuz my wisdom teeth are bugging me but i donno if hes rite or not.. neways its kinda strange when u break up with ur boyfriend people u havent seen in years start talking to u outta nowhere and sumhow know the day after that u broke up with him.. ugh it duznt matter if i tell no one everyone knowwwwsss its making me angry.. and also to neone whos tryna hit on me rite now fuck off i dont want any body else so dont even waste your breath on tryna get me to be with u.. cuz i hate u *sigh* i hate all guys.. theres seriously no such thing as the perfect guy.. same with girls tho.. every person has a major flaw that cant usually be fixed like for me i have low self esteem im clingy annoying and paranoid soo yah ive already figured it out.. its hard to change shit like that for the most part u cant. meh watever thats all i hafta say for today and life sucks heh  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 9thth 2003 Feeling:nothing.. strange..   Well my week with marco pretty much sucked mostly fighting and such but hey what can ya do... neways i have sum bitching to do.. *eh hem* People really need to figure out who they are before they start telling people what they are.. for example.. if sumone thinks they are hardcore and says thats not hardcore.. and then they think their black and they say thats not black.. etc..personally i dont really care what neone hasta say about who i am becuz i am who i am im me.. i do what i please i listen to what i want i live life the way i want... next.. people should stop acting suicidal especially when theyve never put a cold knife against their warm wrists and slit into it before.. u dont know how it feels and u never will so if u really intend to kill urself do it.. dont tell the whole world cuz im shure no one cares at all if ur gonna kill urself stop tryna get the attention that ur not gonna get it next stop stealing other peoples shit be original for once.. and stop being a hypocrite and telling other people to be original... and finally.. "Go crawl back in your hole, we'll pretend you never happened" as u can see there are quotes on that. which means i am quoting sumone.. not stealing thankyou .. *anger*  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 6th 2003 Feeling:head-achy   raped by my child hood? What the hell do I know about rape any way? Well I guess its fun to pretend, sorry. Just a thought that occurred when I wasnt quite awake enough to dismiss it. Its so easy to cheapen an event by pretending it happened. Boring cliched self destruction...I think I should start doing arobics. And the rest: boxes of cats, people with taz tattoos, explosive personalities, self centered, protractors, brand new geometry sets, inability to do math, geography, polaroids of polar bears.  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 5th 2003 Feeling:stressed   Plaid skirts that hide scars walk in single file. Ties that restrict blood to the brain. Passing notes in math class, (freedom ware your scars of desire), it's a coming of age story, (freedom ware your scars of desire), conflicting impulses, (freedom wear your scars of desire) cuts seem to bend the sky. I've read this book before. Anxious eyes stare out of warped glass waiting for the 3 o'clock bell. I'm trying hard to forget that cold october day, when love challenged freedom to a fist fight, freedom looked victorious but no one was prepared for what would happen on that baseball diamond when love reached beneath her plaid jumper, pulled out a switch blade and drove it...directly through the heart of st angelis. Any notion of self government was left bleeding on the pitchers mound.  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 4th 2003 Feeling:releived(HAPPY 3 MONTHS MARCO!! I LOVE YOU!! *MUAH*)   this is really only all we have: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. You had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. These typed letters, beneath me. Fuck with these buttons and knobs long enough and maybe things will turn out fine. Hide behind your crystal screen and blow kisses at me. Remember what we said wouldn't happen? Write your name on my chest in kerosene. Spark a match and you will never be cold again. this is really only all we have: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. You had the coldest eyes and the softest touch: day time, twilight, pitch black, night light. Gag and destroy me bay-bee. I have a large collection of thunder that I stole from your window sill.  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 3rd 2003 Feeling:peachy   jennifer, they lied to you when they said you couldn't breath underwater. I lied to when I said I was hard, because im softer than a thrift store sweater and twice as worn in. I was cast away once but I will be found again. this I promise you.  **LoVe KiRa**  Ranted Oct. 2nd 2003 Feeling:sick/sad/tired etc   sifting through weathered photo albums looking for gloriously aged polaroids of places you have never been. A place to accept that you don't really exist. "Smile for the camera sweet heart, I really want to immortalize this moment" but just remember the first step in forgetting is destroying all the evidence. with friends like you who needs subtext.

I've caught myself drifting in and out of thought.. i fall so deep into my thoughs somtimes i dont even understand where they come frum.. Life is so complicated peoples minds are so complex.. how was this all created? and how will it all end? Unfortunately theres an end to everything that can't be stopped and in the end what will we have... eachother? or not... maybe we will only have ourselves and no one else.. no one too guide us through the storm just ourselves.. will there be a light at the end of the tunnel? or will i be forced too stay in the dark for an eternity.. how will it end.. what am i gonna do... I don't want to start any blasphemous rumors but I think that God's got a sick sense of humor and when I die I expect to find him laughing Ranted May 26th 2003 Feeling:  *sigh* maybe it was a bad idea to break up with him... i miss having sumone too talk too.. but then i think about how he wuldnt listen.. and always thot i was lieing..

       Sometimes I get the feeling That I won't be on this planet for very longI really like it here I'm quite attached to it; I hope I'm wrong.      All I really want to say You're the reason I want to stayI loved you before I met you And I met you just in time Because there was nothing left.      I sat here on my suitcase In our empty new apartment 'til the sun went downAnd I walked back down the stairs With all my bags and drove away You must be freaking out.      All I know is I got to be Where my heart says I ought to beIt often makes no sense, in fact I never understand these things I feel.      Don't change your plans for me I won't move to LA The leaves are falling back east That's where I'm going to stay.      You have made me smile again In fact I might be sore from it It's been awhileI know we've been together Many times before I'll see you on the other side      All I really want to say You're the reason I want to stay But destiny is calling And I told them when my time is up I'm out of here      All I know is I got to be Where my heart says I ought to be It often makes no sense, in fact I never understand these things I feel      I love you, good bye   I love you, good bye

      bah.. today was boring and crappy. I did nothing but sit around all day in my pjs watching tv and sitting on the computer... wow .. i'm just so cool.&nbsp; I was supposed to hang out with Jodie today buut that didn't happen which sucks.. so i just got off the phone with sam roberts kid and yeah.. I feel pretty boring at the moment&nbsp; "anywho gotta go bye" right in the middle of my sentence, Damn there's something wrong with me.. Bah men are so mean.. they all think i'm just some kind of slut that they can screw around with.. and when they find out i'm not.. off i go.. and on they go to someone else.. good times eh?&nbsp; I don't know what to do.. no one appreciates me for who i am.. I feel so alone today.. i didn't get outside once.&nbsp; Sometimes i just feel like i wanna be with someone.. i miss cuddles and kisses and all that fun stuff.. I just miss being wanted.&nbsp; It's depressing... the bluenotes people haven't called me yet so i'm a little worried that i probably didnt get hired,&nbsp; Which would probably just make me feel worse.. meh i'm too lazy to write.. im gonna go clean my room and have a shower.. goodbye. -lots of love and saliva, kira

      Well today was an alright day.. i got up at around 6:30 to get ready for babysitting ay 7:30.. got to babysitting played Yughio cards most of the time.. the boy i was babysitting was so hardcore when it came to the game when i would ask a question he would flip out at me and tell me i was wrong.. he wouldn't be a very good teacher.. i babysat till around 10.. and was asked to come back later that day ay 7:45 to babysit again because the woman had a dinner to go to with her husband.. soo after that stacey and i decided to hit up the mall haha.. umm yes.. i got a shirt.. woot.. and a job interview.. it was strange stacey and i saw this worker at bluenotes taking this blue plasticy stuff off counters with a blow dryer.. and it was all stuck and hard to pull off so we went up to him and we're like "what are you doing?" he's like oh well we decided we wanted to make it colourful this summer but it didnt really work out.. do you wanna help? we were like okay so we started peeling it off and he walked away for a bit then came back and said.. "are you guys looking for a summer job?"&nbsp; we were like yes sir ree bob.. and he was like well bring in your resumes tomorrow and blah blah.. and then after that when i was changing he came back and told us to just come to the group interview on tuesday at 6.. i'm kinda worried because stacey can't come but whatever i hope i do alright.. the thing is i have no retail experience and i'm only 15 so im going to have to make up all that with lots of out going friendlyness YAY lol yeah i can try i guess .. i just hope i don't freeze up i'm scared of people watching me when someone puts me on the spot.. bah whatever i shall not worry about it.. exams are on tuesday haha wow stressful day.. i finished the study guide the teacher made us make for 7 percent.. it looks perty good it was only supposed to be 4 pages but i made it 9.. i hope that's okay.. anyways.. yes i babysat more gave them baths and such. they made me sing to them the same song 4 times before they fell asleep.. and they said i had a prettty singing voice which made me feel all mushy inside haha well anyways i'm off to bed.. night night -lots of love and saliva, kira

I guess you might not want to read it all so download it.. anyways today was a great day.. it was scorching hot .. i went down to value village with zea and jodi.. it was alright except for i was dying.. but i guess today was one of those memorable days that really don't mean anything at all.. but for some reason you remember them.. i love leisurely days.. when its scorching hot outside.. and the ground is steaming and all you do is sit there or read.. or sleep.. its great.. my dad bought pizza and popsicles and fudgesicles and juice to cool us all down.. then my little brother and i sat around outside while i read and listened to music.. and we sorta talked.. then we went and played some basketball with all the little kids in my complex.. we did that tfor a couple of hours.. running around giving them plane rides and doing "wash the dishes dry the dishes turn the dishes over!" One girl kept on making me give her plane rides and i got so dizzy and i gave so many horsie rides and piggy back rides.. -phew- i think i sweat quite a bit.. i'm going to go have a luke warm shower in a few minutes and get off to bed because i have to babysit at 7:30 in the morning.. Summer school is almost over.. and i'm somewhat sad.. and somewhat glad.. i will miss certain people and we'll probably never hang out with again.. and some people i won't miss.. for instance.. alex.. because he's not nice to me bah i would have liked to get to know people better but i guess tis too late i have this little project thing to do this weekend.. well not little its worth 7 percent of my grade which i need because.. if i dont get it i will most likely fail this course because i only have 60 percent.. i'm very worried i wont pass.. ugh.. its stressful.. i just wish i were a kid sometimes.. it was all so much easier back then.. running around in bare feet.. swimming in random neighbours pools.. playing with random kids you didnt know.. it was so simple.. getting stung by a bee was the worst part of your day.. it's sad now that i know that soon i have to grow up.. become an "adult" be "mature" have no imagination.. i wish i could go to never never land.. everything would be just grand there and i could live with peter pan.. but i guess i'm too old for that now eh..? yeah its sad.. well anyways.. i am off bye bye all you non existant readers (except for stacey who always read and whom i love dearly -hug-) bye bye!  -lots of love and saliva, kira

I had a strange dream that there were these falling stars and my dad wouldn't pick me up at school and all the exchange students went back on their bus to china and i was all alone and i died. Um but yes.. today i am seeing anchorman which should be pretty cool i suppose.. and yes.. thats about all i have to say.

      Well today was an alright day. I went to school.. the morning was hell because it was raining like death.. i was standing at the bus stop with my hood on screaming "WHY GOD?! WHY!?! WHY DO YOU HATE ME!" i think people were wondering if i was retarded.. meh oh well.. soo i went to school saw the cool hippie with no shoes.. and met some crazies from sooke.. they made me smell trees.. umm i got really good marks in class today so i was proud except for some kid was spitting spit balls at me and some other guy.. it was really angering and i felt like crying .. but umm yes.. then it got really sunny and i bussed home.. and then i played with my new cat.. i named her Peko.. and then i played with Sasha because she was jealous.. and then i feel asleep for about an hour or so.. and stacey called waking me up telling me she was coming over.. we went to the ball park and got some onion rings and candy and the onion rings WERE GOD! Ugh.. im craving some now.. i was just stuffing my face. I love stacey she always makes me feel better.. then we went for a walk on the trail and took some pictures.. and then we went to the park by my house and started digging at some thing we think is a dead body.. we are going back some other day to keep digging.. because we only had sticks. Man we are so easily amused. Anyways.. i should probably hit the sack.. gotta get up early once again.. 17 more days of this hell. Bye bye

       Narcissistic personality disorder is characterized by self-centeredness. They tend to be choosy about picking friends, since they believe that not just anyone is worthy of being their friend. They tend to make good first impressions, yet have difficulty maintaining long-lasting relationships. They are generally uninterested in the feelings of others and may take advantage of them.   People with schizoid personality disorder avoid relationships and do not show much emotion. They genuinely prefer to be alone and do not secretly wish for popularity. They tend to seek jobs that require little social contact. Their social skills are often weak and they do not show a need for attention or acceptance. They are perceived as humorless and distant and often are termed "loners."    Sounds alot like me now doesnt it?

      Well hello.. i spent most of my night crying in my room.. listening to stupid cheesy love songs and trying to get my parents to stop coming in wondering what was wrong with me.. i think i cried for about 2 hours and my excuse was "I'm pmsing what do you expect" I think i'm becoming a good liar.. I seem to lie alot to my parents now.. it really sucks.. i  am  pmsing.. but normally it doesn't really affect me.. i guess it may have had more of an affect than most night.. Because i haven't cried that much in quite some time.. i'm hurting so bad right now. And i'm so stressed.. i think i need to see a psychiatrist.. maybe get my ass back on some stupid anti depressants.. so i can be "normal" yeah that would be good.. I'd rather be fake and numb then sad.. and dead inside..  I have to get up at 9 tomorrow.. i have an appointment at the clinic to get my fun birth control shot.. I don't even need it.. but i guess its good .. i hate getting my rag anyways.. bah i have a headache goodbye

      Well today was a memorable canada day.. i went over to staceys house this morning to go up island to parksville.. we waited around for a while.. and then we started off on the long drive there.. it took a while because we had to make so many stops.. we stopped at liquidation world.. and i bought some stuff for my room for super cheap and i bought a sweater for $7.99 yeah good buys.. i need to go to Liquidation world more often.. Anyways after that we drove for hours and we finally made it.. Stacey and i walked around a bit.. some stupid guys tried hitting on us but i gave them the finger.. ugh so stupid.. and then we went and walked out to this little island.. but i got scared because the tide was coming in (i have stupid bad experiences with ocean water lol) anyways after that stacey and i just basked in the sun.. and then we realized it was 4 30.. and we had to meet some people downtown at 8.. so we ate quickly.. and went the long drive home.. we came home.. got changed.. and went straight downtown.. it was pretty fun.. we met up with maria meike lea talia.. annd some other people.. and walked around for a bit.. we watched some cool acrobats.. it was fun.. and then stacey chased around emo kids with her camera then i decided to go into the fountain in front of the parliment buildings because stacey said she would give me hot chocolate if i did.. and Leah joined me.. and yes it was cold.. but no problem at all.. annd zen hmm what else.. we umm.. did shtuff.. and then we watched the fire works.. and there were these amusing drunk dudes from ireland.. and we got a picture with them.. then we wandered around downtown after the fireworks.. i saw jem by some bar with people.. so i hid and ran away because i didnt want to embaress him.. and then stacey and i went home.. and that was my day..  -lots of love and saliva, Kira

      Hey hey.. i haven't posted in a while. mostly because nothing interesting has happened .. and it still hasn't lol I've been inside for 4 or 5 days now i've only gone out twice and that was too see a doctor for my  ugly wart and get it burned off and to get an ultrasound too see why im oh so sick all the time.. getting the ultrasound was painful because you have to hold your pee.. and drink 4 big glasses of water an hour or so before you go.. and she kept on pressing on my tummy ugh.. but it was sad because a lady there went to get an ultrasound and she found out she had a miscarriage.. and she was all crying and so was her boyfriend/husband..  tis sad..  umm but yes stacey is coming home from lawn bowling tonight!! And i'm excited.. i hope she wins.. because if she does she wins a new set of bowls that she's probably g onna sell for like 500$ which is quite a bit of money.. she says when she gets back that she's gonna "wine and dine me" lol she's my dream date..  oh by the way.. for people reading this.. stacey and i ARE NOT DATING lol silly people.. anyways.. im going to go find some food.. have a nice evening.. bye bye -lots of love and saliva, kira
