This is gonna be an amazing year - probobly the most exciting in the history of Sister Hazel....  There's our 1st DVD coming out on January 20th (We are VERY excited about this!), To top that, we have our 1st double live CD coming out on the SAME DAY with some addition and different material, a new concert tour, a new Sister Hazel CD later in the spring, the 1st annual "The Rock Slope" in Colorado (This event is gonna blow peoples mind!), our Lyrics For Life charity event '04, The Rock Boat '04 AND a holiday CD ready for next holiday season. Anyone whose been around this band knows that there will be endless fun and countless suprises along the way. We've never been more excited about what lies ahead. If you ever thought about checking out what it's like to be a Hazelnut -- Jump in and HOLD ON TIGHT!  Ken Block Sisterhazel   I can't wait for the DVD, and the new Sister Hazel CD.

      I just don't get it some times. In a world filled with thousands upon thousands of products to make you smell good, there's always a few people that seem to have let the deodorant revolution pass them by. Do they even know that they smell about as sweet as a butt crack? I just don't get how they can smell so raunchy and not notice it. Everyone else around them can, so why the hell can they not realise that, when they're smelling the same nasty smell ALL DAY when they move around, that it's prolly not the people they pass in the hallways, and it might actually be their stinky ass? My personal belief is that there should be some law against people not wearing some form of protection. And I'm not talking about the kind of protection that is ribbed for your pleasure, I'm talking about the kind that protects all of us from your funky ass smellin' pits.

      Welp, I've successfully managed in pissing off my mom to the point of her saying I should just move out. What did I do? I got lost coming home (DOT had shut down 206th street, which I usually turn on to off of 37), and when I tried reaching my dad on his nextel, got static. When I tried reaching her, I didn't get any response at all. When I finally found my way home, I asked her why she didn't have her cell phone turned on, and she got pissed because I was home late (well no shit, I was lost einstein) and because I "had an attitude" again. Whatever. I'm honestly getting so sick of my parents that it's not even funny.

      Grrr. Some the way customers are treated just really makes me mad sometimes. Case in point, rhapsody, the love of my life. I signed onto my account today, hoping to listen to the new train album (I already own it, but it's so much easier to just log into rhapsody and play it). Once I had logged in, I scrolled down through my list of artists in my virtual library. For some reason, train was greyed out. When I clicked on them, I found that I could no longer listen to them on the rhapsody service. What the heck? Not only was trian greyed out, but so were several other artists in my list. Don't get me wrong, I realise that there is some music that rhapsody won't be able to offer, but it's my personal belief that when you offer a service and charge for it, you should continue to offer the full service. I'm starting to think about switching over to the newly relaunched (and 100% legal) service, Napster. Not only do they offer more music, but they also let you download mp3 files, something that rhapsody has yet to offer.

      I know a bunch of friends have been asking me what I mean when I talk about Rhapsody. Rhapsody is a legal music service that lets me listen to over 400,000 songs whenever I want for 10 bucks a month. If I want to burn any of those songs, it costs me $0.89 a song. Not bad considering I'm always getting only the songs that I want, rather than buying a CD at Best Buy and getting two songs that I want, and then a bunch of filler for $13 - $15.  ---- I'm listening to: Blue Man Group  Audio  I'm watching: Law and Order

      Why is my dad such an ass? Honestly. After the crappy day that I've had, as soon as he gets home, he gets on my case. I don't feel like retyping it all, so I'll post a peice of an MSN convo that I had with andy while this was going on: 11/10/2003  5:04:44 PM  Cameron:  i f***ing hate my parents  11/10/2003  5:05:03 PM  Cameron:  jesus christ, they started yelling at me saying that I need to drop my tone  11/10/2003  5:05:12 PM  Andy:  are they pmsing  11/10/2003  5:05:18 PM  Cameron:  I didn't have a freaking tone with them, I didn't say two words  11/10/2003  5:05:34 PM  Andy:  why are they doing that  11/10/2003  5:05:37 PM  Cameron:  She just got pissed off because I was talking to you guys when she asked me to come talk to her  11/10/2003  5:05:43 PM  Cameron:  Because they're both assholes  11/10/2003  5:06:04 PM  Cameron:  I want out, this is getting so freaking old.  11/10/2003  5:06:14 PM  Cameron:  They can both go to hell. I told them that too.  11/10/2003  5:06:24 PM  Andy:  just stay in your room the rest of the night  11/10/2003  5:06:32 PM  Cameron:  that's what I do every night  11/10/2003  5:06:40 PM  Cameron:  Because everytime I come out, this is what happens  11/10/2003  5:06:43 PM  Cameron:  I'm tired of it dude  11/10/2003  5:06:57 PM  Cameron:  I get enough of it at school, I shouldn't have to deal with it at home too  11/10/2003  5:07:24 PM  Andy:  tell em to back off  11/10/2003  5:07:29 PM  Cameron:  I did  11/10/2003  5:07:45 PM  Cameron:  My dad said I need to quit with the tone unless I want a boot up my ass  11/10/2003  5:07:49 PM  Cameron:  To quote him exactly  11/10/2003  5:08:13 PM  Andy:  thats terrible  11/10/2003  5:08:39 PM  Cameron:  God he's such a prick  11/10/2003  5:08:51 PM  Cameron:  Now I'm crying like a freaking baby  11/10/2003  5:09:01 PM  Andy:  dude don't cry  11/10/2003  5:09:07 PM  Cameron:  It's prolly a good thing you didn't come over   It didn't end there. Later my dad got mad because I told him to wait a couple minutes before he moved the cable modem (for the internet) while he was putting in a new desk. I asked him to wait because I was talking to andy, elizabeth, and jessica, and wanted to finish my conversations with them without just all of a sudden signing off with no reason. He told me he'd move it if he wanted, I told him to just wait a couple minutes, and he told me I better lose the attitude if I wanted to keep my front teeth. I'm so sick of all this crap, I know my dad wouldn't actually hurt me physically (he's only got really rough with me a couple times), but he still always makes me feel like I'm anything but a son to be proud of. Maybe he's right. I mean, I've never really shined in anything, what is there to be proud of?

      I want out. Okay, today's been a major pain in the ass for the most part. When I first got up, I could just tell it was going to be a crappy day. Nothing helped prove this right for the first two periods of the day (Physics and US History), and Web Design wasn't that bad either (other from the usual cold shoulder from the nerds because I'm not like them). The last period of the day (CAD) is when things started getting crappy. First of all, on the way there, Patrick Schiess came up behind me and asked me if I actually moved when I walked. I have a bad knee, and it makes me walk a little differently from most people (it's not egor bad, but still noticeable). I brushed this off, and thought it was just Patrick trying to get to me because he's an arrogant prick. I went to CAD, and sat next to the people that I usually do (my friends Melinda and Joey on my right, Michael Galyan and some arrogant panzies on the left). About halfway into the class, I thought I heard Eric Forbes and his "groupies" say something about me. I listened in, and they were making fun of me and joey, calling him and I both fags, and mocking us when we'd say something to someone. It brought back a lot of memories from Kindergarten through prolly 8th grade when I used to get picked on, and beat up (physically). While I know it's something I should brush off because their opinions don't mean anything to me, when someone makes fun of you non-stop for an hour and a half, it starts to eat at you. Needless to say, I was ready to go home after CAD, and was actually looking forward to today because Andy was coming over, and he hadn't been over to my house in nearly three weeks. Well, he asked his mom yesterday if he could come over, and she said she'd tell him in the morning, only she forgot to tell him. So, after school, he tried calling her, but she wouldn't answer. He told me to follow him to his house, and he'd ask her when we got there. I had to take my ex girlfriend Beth home, but I wanted to see if he could come over, so we went to his house with her in tug. When we got to his house, his mom wasn't home, so he called her cell phone again, and she told him that he couldn't come over, even though I had made plans and told some people that are working on a project with me that I couldn't do anything because he was coming over (meaning I wasted an entire afternoon that I could have used on the project). I was a little irked that she wouldn't let him come over because he would end up sitting at home doing nothing anyway, but I brushed it off. I left his house to take Beth home, and on the way she said that it was a waste of time, and that she could have been home by the time I found out that Andy couldn't come over. When we got to her house, she blew up at me for god knows what, said cya later, slammed my door, and ran inside. I just LOVE it when people that I'm helping out show their thanks by being an ass to me. What a fun day it's been...and it's not even over yet *groan*.

      Well, another day, another dolla....oh wait, that's right I don't have a job. I was supposed to go apply for a job at Target as a cashier where my best friend (Andy), and another good friend (Stephen) work. Well, as usual, plans changed. I took along a friend (Elizabeth) to go with me because she needed to pick some things up, and I found out from andy, who was working, that the application takes fourty-five minutes. I didn't want to leave Elizabeth by herself while andy was working and I was applying, so we ended up wandering around target with andy while he as on his break, and then we went off to best buy so that I could grab Blue Man Group's old debut CD "Audio". I went home, blasted the CD, then headed off to bed. Not much else went on today (yup, reaaaal exciting day, huh?).

      So life still isn't good. Breaks are great most of the time, but this time it's suck. I haven't been able to see my friends as much as I like, and I haven't been able to see a couple really good friends at all. It also doesn't allow for wounds to heal, it just allows them to get deaper. Minor things that occured at the end of school have become major, and caused a lot of rifts in friendships.

      Well, to continue with my down feeling, I guess I might as well bring it up. It doesn't feel like christmas at all. I don't know what it is, but it doesn't feel like christmas at all to me. I hate to break it to everyone, but the christmas spirit is dead. Loving each other, and celebrating the birth of Jesus has been replaced with loving that new expensive MP3 player that you got, and celebrating the two weeks off that you get. It happened to St. Valentines day, and now the time has finally come for Christmas to finally sucumb the same fate. It's official, christmas has lost all non material meaning, and is now a halmark holiday. I could go into this more, but I already feel like going to sleep without waking up because of what I rambled about below. Anyway, for those of you that are still fooled into the belief that christmas is more than a way for american eagle to boost its bottom line, I've picked out some christmas music for you care of rhapsody. Take a listen if you'd like, I've got RHAPSODY and Napster links, so just click to listen through whichever program you like more.   urlLink Napster Link   urlLink RHAPSODY Link

      I admit it, I don't like elvis. I know you're not supposed to hate anything, so I guess you could say I strongly dislike elvis to the point where I wish he were born a mute. Well, I was scanning through rhapsody today, and found a new remix of Rubbernieckin', and it's actually good. And by good I mean I was able to listen to it without wanting to stab my eyes out with a spork. So yeah, I just thought I'd share that. Take a listen and see what you think.  urlLink Rubberneckin'

      You always hear about it happening to other people, but it's one of those things you never think will happen to you. I don't get it...everything was going just fine and then it happened. WHY the hell do they feel they have to interrupt Law and Order, for the NBA? Isn't that why we have ESPN 1-20? Drama isn't the NBA Playoffs, drama  is  Law & Order on TNT. I think my second favorite commedian, Larry the Cable Guy (Phil Hartman will always be #1), described how I feel best when he said "I was madder than a one legged etheopian chasing a doughnut down a hill". While I'm on my soapbox, I guess I'll throw out another complaint with TNT. TNT usually is a great network to watch, with great original shows. But WHAT THE HELL were they thinking when they decided to put the new Hootie and the Blowfish music video in heavy rotation just so that they could advertise their new made-for-tv movie "Goodbye Girl"? I used to love Hootie and the Blowfish, but quite honestly, I'd rather be a cupless wearing dummy for a women's self defense class than listen to that damned song one more time.

      What's better than an overpriced mp3 player? An even smaller mp3 overpriced mp3 player, now in five fruity colors! Yeah, I know...I got an iPod, and I love it. But really....what the hell was apple thinking when they released these new mini disasters? The pink one looks like it belongs in a tampax commercial, to be honest with you...and aside from the silver one, I don't think I'd want to be caught dead with one unless I wanted people to think that I should be guest starring on Will and Grace. To keep with the apple thing, I finally tried iTunes. All I have to say is KICK ASS. I can't believe how nice it is being able to click "buy track" and have it automatically sync'd to my iPod. With my old Zen (I almost miss it and its 80s-esque cassette player look) I had to manually drag new songs onto it, which got to be a pain in the ass when I had 1400 songs in my collection.

      Nothing major happened today, so I'll just ramble on about some stuff I guess.  What's the best way to piss off a teacher? Call her a drunk, of course! And who in their right mind would be dumb enough to do something like that? No-one...but I'm not exactly right in my mind, so I guess that's why I said it. Word to the wise: No matter how much your teacher acts like a drunk, never call them one.   My schedule this semester sucks! I didn't get my favorite teacher back (Mr. Knotts...he's insane in a cool way, so I'm going to try to transfer to his class), and at the same time, my new english teacher is off the edge freaky, but still kinda cool.  So yeah, random post today. I'm going to go back to watching NYPD Blue, and maybe...just maybe I'll make another post today because I know that everyone that reads this refreshes the page every few seconds just to see if I've posted something new...of course when the number of people reading this is 0, I can also say that they're all girls hotter than paris hilton, and that they all want me badly...

      I'm not sure if there are words that could do this concert justice. Dexter Freebish came on a little after 7:45, and rocked the house until Sister Hazel came on at 9:00. Sister Hazel was absolutely amazing. You could feel the energy coming off the guys as they jammed up on stage. The set list for both bands couldn't have been any better, either. The highlight of the evening for me was when Ken Block (lead singer of Sister Hazel) came out for an encore and sang an acoustic version of "Running Through The Fields", a song that he wrote about his brother who he lost to cancer. It actually brought chills to listen to him, and watch how the huge crows of people became instantly silent. But it's easy to see how, as the song was so moving that literally everyone was in tears. I'll post a more thorough review of the concert later, but for now I just wanted to get a picture up and give a quick overview of what it was like.   urlLink    Ken Block

      If someone told me to describe today in three words, I'd either say "shut up, I'll use as many as I want", or I'd say "Boring as hell" depending on the kind of mood that I was in. Anywho I did absolutely nothing today aside from watching the MTV Movie Awards (someone clue MTV in that it's  NOT  halloween).

      This one care of Sister Hazel. This song nails the way my (lack of a) love life is.    If it's to be That there's just no one for me I'll try not to cry much So no one will see But if it's to be That there is anyone for me Our hearts will shine So everyone will see I've got some time, So maybe if you're free I could use a friend Just to talk to me   Spent most of my life without Anyone near Never cared what happened I never saw clear But I'm getting older now And I'm, thinking of my end And to leave without love Or without a friend  I've got some time So maybe if you are free I could use a friend  Before I die   It's not over yet... I'm still standing   If it's to be  That there's just no one for me I will try not to cry much So no one else will see I've got some time So maybe if you're free I could use a friend Just to talk to me

Like the life that I'm living isn't mine, it's someone elses.

      How sad is this? I've become so bored in the past week that I actually put my picture up on one of those "hot or not" type websites. It's kinda cool though. I've managed to meet a couple really cool (and not so cool) people. Evidently a lot of people think I'm either really hot (they gave me a 10), or think I'm really ugly (they gave me a 1). Oh well, can't please everyone.

      I think I need to go to a quack. Honestly. Ever since I've bought my iPod, I've become obsessed with buying music on iTunes. So far I've bought a little under 100 songs off of iTunes, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. It's just so easy to do though. I hear a song on Z995, and all I have to do is go home, open iTunes, click on the song, and it's automatically on my iPod so I can hear it anywhere I want.  urlLink To prove my point, let's take a look at my inbox, shall we?
