      last monday, jun 14, i had my final presentation. it was a great experience for me. we made an amazing job as a team. I would like to say thank you to two of my partners, eduardo and sunil. It was a tremendous experience to work with you guys. I was so lucky to be in this team. I can't believe it that we made it this far and what we did as our term 6 project was was was amazing. Thank you also for other classmates and faculty and not to forget for families who gave us support day and night, especially to doudi who always motivates me, never gives up hope for me so i can be here right now, and gives me the courage to really step up my feet and follow my dreams, and also for being so patient to me..  I can't believe we are graduating soon.. it just went so fast.. thank you for giving us the experience to work underpressure, to stay day and night at school, to sleep on the couch (has to be there on time, otherwise other student will take over and i just had to sleep on the floor), to be so patient, to be so cheering, to be a place where i can envision what i wanted to be.. just thank you VFS..

      I know I'm in love and all I can think about is my very special someone, I can't stand to be away for more than a second. The more I'm away; the more I'm dying to be with. I miss you even when you are next to me, even when you are next to my hearing but yet weâ€™re so far away. I think and dream of you every night in my sleep. I love you from the bottom of my heart. Let me know as often as possible if you care, but let me know once if not anymore.
