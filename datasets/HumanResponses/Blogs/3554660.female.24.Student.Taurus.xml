      I have been having a real rough summer. I haven't been able to find a job so I have had a lot of time on my hands. I had thought that this would be a great opportunity to really grow in my faith. This has been quite the opposite. I haven't spent a lot of time reading the word or in prayer. My best friend helped me to pinpoint why and gave me a few suggestions. I also do a bible study with one of the advisors here and she also helped me to pinpoint some problems. She also gave me some ideas to help me to overcome my weakened state of Faith. I learned that life without discipline is chaotic. I also learned that as far away from Jesus that I might be is has never left my side. I am so thankful that I live in an environmen that is so understanding and can help me to get back on track before I lose way. I am also thankful that the Lord has given me such good friends that I can turn to in a time of need. I have learned that God 's faith will always be here. I trust the Lord with all of my heart and know in my heart that whatever I am going through he will still love me. Jesus died on the cross for my sins and yours. He loves you that much. If you don't know Jesus as your Savior please ask someone about his love for you.

      My mom and my sister came to visit for the week and my sister brought her karoke machine and we are having a blast. I am excited that they made the trip safely. Mom is staying just for the weekend, But Jacki is staying until the weekend of father's day. We are going to rent movies and play games and have a great time together. It is always so nice to spend time with your family.

      Sunday evening my pastor gave a really exciting sermon about fearing the Lord. He said that we fear many things, which I positively agree with. I personally fear a lot of things. One of my friends once asked me, "Why are you so scared of everything?" I honestly don't know why I fear so many things. Some of the things that I do fear there isn't a reson to fear them at all. Seriously who is scared of the dark? Little children and me I can't even say why I am scared I just have this overwhelming discomfort in complete darkness. The same thing happens when it storms outside. I know that I am not scared of God, or am I?     God has given us many promises. Promises that I look forward to seeing. Some I have already seen. So I ask myself do I fear the lord? Yes, I am not scared of him. I am not scared that he will turn his back on me when I need him. I know that he has a great plan and I am to trust him with all of my heart and I do. So how do I fear the lord? I fear that I will displease him. I may not ask for forgiveness. I may think that my sin is little, when really all sins are equal. I fear that I may shame my father for it is a Father's love that I look for in God and recieve it. I fear that my mistakes in my mind will be great even though I know that his son Jesus Christ has died to take them away from me. As I live my life I keep the fear of the lord in my mind so I may not make as many mistakes. God loves us unconditionally, we can show him the same kind of love by living for him by fearing him.  Psalms 103:13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.

      Hey everyone! I know that I haven't written for a while but I have been really sick so I have left my home to stay with my parents. I found out that I am going to have surgery and I am scared about it. All of my friends are at home and my sisters just don't understnad. My youngest sister is pregnant and has been really hard to live with she thinks that the world owes her and doesn't let anyoone get close to her. She has some real anger issues and has a bad attitude about everything. My other sister is really lazy and selfish and lies all the time. She refuses to get a job because she can stay at home and live off of my parents. They are both mad at me for coming home for six weeks because I love the lord and have a better way of looking at what life has to&nbsp; offer instead of being angry that I have been sick for a year and have to have surgery. God is so amazing and has so much to offer and it hurts to see my sisters rresist him when I know that he can make them so much happier. I have never met two such unhappy people.
