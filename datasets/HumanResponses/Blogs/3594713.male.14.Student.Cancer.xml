       Today was boring. I don't know why, but I didn't really didn't do anything. I was going to ask a friend if they wanted to play tennis, get some lunch and go down the street, but that didn't end up happening. I couldn't be bothered, maybe tomorrow.  Well today, I got up at about 8.30am hehe, the earliest I've gotten up all holidays. The dog woke me up, he was going crazy at my window to come in. so I let him in, he was on my bed for a few minutes, but ran out. So I had to get up, and make sure he didn't piss anywhere. He's a jack russell, 2 years and 9 months old, and quite recently has developed the habit of marking his territory inside. Lol.  Then I took the dog for a walk, and my borther and sister were building a treehouse, so I annoyed them for a while. Then I went on the computer. My brothers friends is sleeping over, and he's starting to piss me off. He is hanging around me more then my brother. He'll be gone tomorrow anyway.  So that was my very boring day, I'll blog soon.

       Hey everyone, haven't bloged in a long time. So what has happened since last blog? Well I'm on holidays now. Have been since 25th June, so thats a two week break. Its almost the end of the first week of the holidays. They seem to be going so fast, I'm really dreading the start of school again :( But thats over another week away, so I'll try enjoy the rest of the holidays best I can, and try and foget about school, hehe. I know it won't make it go away, but at least for a little while I can think that I never have to go to school again. I'm a genius. Not.  Ok so the holidays so far. Well up until Tuesday, it was a pretty lazy couple of days. Stayed at home, playing the computer (the Sims, Age of Empires II, Grand Theft Auto III  Tuesday it was my 14th birthday!!! It was a pretty boring day actually, cos mum and dad were working, so it didn't really feel like my birthday, but o well.   Wednesday, we actually celebrated my birthday. We went to the movies, and saw Spiderman 2, it rocked. Even though it wasn't as good as the first one (I think sequels are always shit), it was still one of the best movies I've ever seen. Anyway, that night we went out for dinner for my birthday. The food was shit, still half frozen, but I got more presents (money ;)). Sometimes I wish people would have better creativity and motivation to buy me an actual present. Don't get me wrong, money is cool, you can buy what you want, but it isn't as exciting when you just get an envelope, compared to a wrapped present that you have no idea what it is. But nan gave me another cactus (hehe, I'm a cactus collector), some ornaments for my other cactus gardens, and $20. so that was nice.  Thursday was another boring day of lazing around the house, not much there.  And today practically the same ;)  Anyway, will blog soon.
