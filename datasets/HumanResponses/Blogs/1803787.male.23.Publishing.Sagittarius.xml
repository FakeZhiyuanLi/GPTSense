      No iPod.. I have decided it is a great thing that I truly and really want. It will be like a little brother to my eMac. But in the mean time I have credit card bills that piled up while in college and now that I am out of college, I should start paying them off. I really need to pay them off so that I can work on building my credit back up. I am not gonna be one of those people that lie... I like to shop and I am the perfect example of an American.. I live in excess always trying to get the biggest and the best and in reality I never use half of the sh*t that I own. I like to buy clothes and purchase new gadgets. Do I wear all of the clothes that I own? NOPE... Do I buy new clothing regularly?? YES!! I feel like me more than most people, I try to live this life that portrays myself as a hipster, a man on the move with a lot of content to himself but in reality, I feel I don't have any content inside. Then I see people with content who are always complaining because they don't have what they want.    Anyway.. It is off to the mall to check out new clothes, maybe buy a pair of shoes, & eat @ the food court.  See You All Soon...  Chris

      Today was an interesting day @ work... Larry was speeding around. I believe I will be asked for my negatives...and as an artist, I shall refuse. I am looking for someone to help me with dreamweaver but I have yet to find anyone that is willing to meet me with their laptop and instruct me based on a cash payment.   Well I am finally becoming part of the bloggin community... Looking foward to creating a photoblog real soon..

       urlLink    Hey...Bloggin at work on a friday... I just want to say that I am happy to be alive and a christian in this day and age..  but I hate someone at my office and I want to shoot her. It is nothing against her personally as a person in life but as a professional she is absolutely ridiculous and insane. I mean If she could she would do nothing all day and then take credit for creating the world. Some days I just go insane...from her laziness and stupidity... I want to shoot myself in the head.  anyway I am happy to be alive but I hate work sometimes..  chris

      Today..is the first day of the rest of my life! I am all set... took the day off from work and now I am getting dressed and ready for the concert of a lifetime. Dave Matthews Band is playing in Central Park tonight and I am going!! After a week and a half of not successfully getting tickets, Jackie (my cousin) got 2 tickets for me and Liz to go. I am so excited... I wanted to see DMB play in MSG but they were always sold out.. or I didn't have a job to give me the funds to go. Ironically now that I have a job and can purchase tickets, I get the chance to go to a free concert! I was planning on getting lots of pictures but they aren't allowing any photography for the concert. which sucks because they are having special sections where you can go and bootleg the audio.   I mean are the future DVD sales of the concert so important that they can't allow a bunch of hippie fans to come on in and take pictures?? I know that even if I could take some photos, Dave and the band would look like Ants Marching on stage!!  I haven't blogged in a while. I just want to say that I am in a great mood and very happy with life. I miss my girlfriend, because instead of just having time to be together we are forced to spend time talking on the phone when one of us is busy or the other is in la la land because they have work/school all day. Or we spend some of our weekends entertaining others because that is what is expected..   This weekend I just want to relax.. I want to live like we used to when we didn't have a good job and couldn't afford anything.. I want to just relax watch a movie or go to a park and hang out. Sweat.. i want to run around a park and play tag or soccer or just hang out and relax and Sweat... because those are the things you do when you don't have money for the luxuries like Cafe's with cold drinks and air conditioning.   Fall is coming up and it is my favorite time of the year because I get to wear cool clothes and I think about way the air feels and how good it is to breath.. I am going to go now to finish getting ready but I will be back blogging tonight stating how freakin great this was.    -Big Chris :)

Plus I am hoping to get out of a day of work..which seems highly unlikely..  I got suckered into working this sunday at the CULTURE FEST which is being held in Battery Park in NYC. So I should be near a table with a huge sign that reads MUSEUMS MAGAZINES... and I will be handing out copies of our magazines.. We may be paired up in the NYC & Company tent / site or just on our own. So if you are there stop by and check out the Tall Guy that's me Chris!!

      I am home now finally.. Was at Liz's house watching the Conan O'Brien Special, and drinking Chai..   Sometimes it feels great to hang out with the girl your in love with and just relax and not feel pressured to do something extraordinary because social pressures tell you to and also to not have to entertain other guests..  I feel at home when I am with her and her family, I hope she feels the same way when she spends time with me and my family.  I haven't written in a while and I have a lot to say I just don't have the patience sometimes to stay and write.  I am sad because for the X # of weeks now I have missed church again. Ever since getting a full time job and not being in a collegiate schedule, I have not made it to church on a regular basis. This makes me sad because I feel it is one thing that I really enjoy in life that doesn't harm anyone, or create a stir or require money or planning. It is a one hour a week session with the man upstairs. I do pray and I think and I meditate alone with my thoughts. I am growing to be that better person I strive to be.  But it happens, I sin and make mistakes but I try to get back on that track of living a good clean healthy Christian life and I do..   I am going to go to bed now and sleep so that I can get up early and get ready for work. BTW all of you blogger fans out there.. I wore my newly acquired Blogger T-Shirt to work on Casual Friday and I was complimented by everyone.. even the Publisher Larry!! It made my day.  Until next time... Codington!

      Last night was great.. For the first time, I was out with my parents, family and friends and actually tossing back beers with my dad and mom. I know for some people this may sound weird and wrong but for me it was soo money baby! I went to the Brooklyn Cyclones game and they lost, which was sad. But I got to hang out with my mom at the game and then drink with my dad and family at Peggy O'Neills. It was cool to just relax and hang out.  I got to meet Lisa's friend Frank Morano, which was cool. So Rheingold is probably one of my new favorite beers at a bar, and I will always drink my Heinekens, just Rheingolds seem so much cheaper. lol    I am outta here. I will be back later to write more..   -chris

       urlLink Big Chris   Today/Tonight I got some really bad news... I was informed today that my best friend ernest's grandmother has passed away and is no longer with us. I am going to go to the funeral and take off from work tomorrow and I am truly sad that it takes an event like this for me to really push to call up ernest and stop by his house. I love the guy.. I mean seriously he is on my level creatively...spiritually He is a second brother.  Spending time tonight with his family just made me realize how important connecting and keeping relationships alive and flowing with love, energy and good karma. I am really tired and not even sure what I am writing but basically I just want to say that along with my working to become the better person I want to be, I also want to make a statement that from this day foward I am going to push to stay connected to those friends who I have made over the years and who I lose touch with. Whether it is because i am too busy or they are very busy with their own lives, i just want to make sure that i make all efforts to keep the connections because these are the people who I want in my life for the rest of my life. they are the ones who will be there to bounce creative ideas off of and to go to t-ball games with and the ones who will have kids and my kids will play with, or maybe they won't have kids but will adopt mine as their honorary nephew/niece who they will spoil rotten and teach to become a better man/woman and tell them things and to remind me that I was a kid once.   I just want to say that i love the lingad family and the extended family that comes with it and I know if i ever have a question about my faith or christianity, Frank would be there to guide me and to explain the scripture to me.. I really wish I was spending more time with them and I think that will be a pre-new years resolution that I will make to spend atleast one day a month in the company of the lingad family..    goodnight all... a big day ahead and a lot of prayers to be said before hitting the pillow tonight...

      so I have been rocking out with my iPod, listening to it constantly.  I took the class in dreamweaver two weekends ago and I am now sitting here trying to get a basic html page so that I can begin layout of my blog and eventually webpage.  It is so damn annoying.. I mean maybe it is because my only free time is a few hours between work and sleep (going to sleep early so that I can get up for work). But right now it is really annoying because all that I learned about dreamweaver and setting up frames and framesets as well as cells and tables is slowly seeping out of my brain...  I have a few things that I want to start thinking about... Like I am going to get serious and start planning out where and when I am going to start shooting video interviews for the documentary that seth is working on. I am going to have fun because I haven't had any real assignments since working for the school newspaper and taking photographs and writing articles for it. I also have this crazy idea to start working on a photo documentary of how Fall Bleeds into Winter... I keep having this idea of shooting it with polaroids .. but i think to myself how I have a holga and tons of film which I want to shoot with and I also think about how I have my digital elph and how I never take full advantage of it so I really need to start shooting and going out and taking control and harnessing my creative talents. I am sorry that I haven't been blogging regularly, I really want to. among other things... I have issues about things that I want to do everyday and a person I want to become but I keep failing myself, and moving further than the spot that I want to be in.  I think tomorrow, I am going to start moving towards that center position that I want to be at in my life.   Goodnight all... btw if you have a favorite artist and you are reading this post a response and let me know the artist and album, i am looking to diversify my iPod..   -nite

      I have wanted one of these for so long.... that I am going to cry when I finally have it in my hands cradling it like the pure beautiful baby it is....  urlLink Apple - iPod  So now that I just made a fool of myself. I just want everyone to know.. that I finally just splurgged on  something that I can afford but have to cut out the 12 dollar lunches to really afford. So I did it, I decided I will order my ipod. the 20 gig one, not going for the whole kick your music machine ass 40 gig one.. just going with the 20 gig, that comes with the cute carrying case and the headphones ipod. I was sad because liz said she would get it for me for my birthday but that is in december and being the greedy american that I am... I cannot wait any longer... lol So I figure she can get me other things that I love to receive from her, like accessories or creative things.. one of her best gifts to me was a starbucks gift card... every time i used it, i would smile and think beautiful coffee a gift from liz.. :)   i know it all sounds cheezy but it is so true. Last year she also got me this beautiful jacket from the gap and it was funny because I almost bought that one and she had to confess to me that she already bought it for me...  well i just hope she doesn't have that ipod hidden away in a closet....  I am so happy with my life... Yes, I would like a little bit of a bigger paycheck..but that is only because I would like to pay off more of my debt. but when I think of buying things like the iPod it is hard to pay off of the debt.   enough of my rambling...  goodnight all...  liz i love you....

      I am stating today that I will definitely start blogging once a day! Basically I started working harder today than ever before.. I started discussing layout options and ideas with an advertising agency for the first time. I think, I am fully starting to understand the process of advertising and working within a magazine and trying to pitch a deal, get a deal, seal the deal and then deliver it. I am having a revelation into my life. I know I have issues, addictions in life and I am trying to dismiss those that harm and hinder my individual growth and progress. I am going to write down all the things about life that interest me and all those people who feed me that creative mojo! Especially the man upstairs, the triple threat to all that satan has to offer, The Lord!! I am starting to read the bible where as I never would before because of fear of what people would think.. i mean how do i expect god to accept me as a disciple, a follower if i cannot accept him with my heart wide open.  I am in love with the thought of love, passion and insanity with love... so I think the first thing I will need to find out is how GOD = LOVE.   I am going to take a class at   to learn web design so that in a few weeks I will be able to create and master my own layout of my blog as well as begin the forming of my own website to showcase the artistic talent that I feel  I have to share with the world.    BTW i just want to make a shout out to Seth Worley.. I have to say you're blog sometimes makes me think about life up here in the north east and i wonder why someone in a city full of creative people cannot find the inspiration that you possess.   More to come from the mind of Chris..   I love you all!!

      Last night me and liz went and saw John Mayer!! He rocked out @ MSG. Pretty Good concert although I learned some things.. John Mayer has Thousands of Thirteen Year Old Girls as Fans. John Mayer is also kind of cocky.. He spoke about how he ruled the record executives, all in all it was great. It is a lot of fun when you can sit back and hold hands with someone you love or like and just enjoy a night out. I am exhausted now, falling asleep on the bed as I type.   Oh btw... that crazy woman came back to the house again. She told Pop, that I was rude and mean to her and that she wanted a tour of the lighthouse. He told her to call back in 3 weeks, and she said that she wanted to call his supervisor to complain that we were rude. So he said "Would you like the number??" and she got mad. I am sorry but I am sick and tired of people just walking on to the property and expecting to be greeted like they are welcome visitors. There is expensive equipment inside the tower and we don't need some average joe screwing something up. Besides, shouldn't people have some common courtesy, the fact is that it is a government installation so I understand it is public in a way, but we are at war. You can't just walk on to a government base and say "Well Where Is The Tour? I want the Tour!!!"...You would be Shot or Held for trespassing and prosecuted. We still have our troops, men and women fighting in another country and we still have the possible threat of a terrorist action adn this lady shows up at 730pm on a sunday night and expects everyone to drop what we are doing so that she can go up the tower... Forget it!!  BTW who the hell is Al Greenberg... Not Al Green the Singer but Al Greenberg...  I sure as hell don't know him!!   Later kids... it's off to work.

      Today I went to Pops again the Sunday ritual. We had lasagna and I had to tell this annoying woman that we weren't currently doing any tours of the lighthouse and that if she wanted to see it with her family she would have to come back  in six months when the troops pull out the occupation of IRAQ because we are at a weird time and the government won't allow any visitors. I have no problem giving tours but I can't stand the fact that people just walk in the yard like they own the place. I mean if I just walked into your yard and started taking pictures or yelling and talking wouldn't you consider that trespassing? So all these morons just walk on to the property which at all entrances has a sign posted that reads GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, NO TRESPASSING!! VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED. Apparently people cannot read.   So last night, we took a rode trip to Hazlet, NJ and visited Terri-Ann's Casa. It was cool because we went to Houlihans and then rented Hollywood Homicide. I thought the movie was okay nothing great but okay for a Saturday night gathering of friends. My friends the movie critics thought it sucked..Meanwhile if they had to watch something great like 400 Blows or Amelie they would be in agony. I want to  see a few movies and I have yet to get off my ass and watch them.. I think I am going to try and take advantage of next weekend being a 4 day weekend and I am gonna go and watch a few movies. I wanna see Lost In Translation, 21 Grams, Love Actually, Pieces of April, Radio, Sylvia, The Station Agent, & To Be and To Have!!  If anyone is interested email me because I want to see these movies. BTW I need some help figuring out how to change some links and how to put an email me link into the blog.. I am going to try and work on this tonight.   Anyway tomorrow begins the three day work week and I am going with Liz to see John Mayer @ MSG! It should be a lot of fun. I hope we can just cuddle and relax and not be stressed out because we both need a break from the norm. Goodnight..

      At work, there is one sales rep who is constantly asking me about the proper spelling of the words, and usually as I am mid sentence with the spelling another assistant blurts out the word and correct spelling. Almost as if she is waiting to hear me screw up and has to prove that she is the almighty speller.. Well to the almighty speller and to those who have problems spelling, I am now going to be doing posts such as this!   mel·an·chol·y   ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (mln-kl) n.   1.	Sadness or depression of the spirits; gloom: “There is melancholy in the wind and sorrow in the grass” (Charles Kuralt). 2.	Pensive reflection or contemplation. 3.	Archaic. a.	Black bile. b.	An emotional state characterized by sullenness and outbreaks of violent anger, believed to arise from black bile.

      They Say It's My Birthday..... Happy Birthday To Me...   Well today is my 23rd Birthday. I am officially an old fart. I am approximately 1/4 of my grandfathers age. All I can do is hope to make it to his age healthy and happy. The last 4 days have been some of the toughest days I can go through. The man whom I looked up to was being embalmed and displayed for us his family and closest friends to pay our respects. We thought about all the good times and the not so good times. With pop there weren't any bad times, I think that is a result of him living through the country's depression era and already conquering the bad times that he provided so much love and care that we never encountered a bad time. I loved my grandfather because he was so good. He would do everything for us or anything for us. If we were building something he would have us help him make it but trust me he taught us how to sand and how to stain wood and how to nail and glue. He was a painter also...painting houses or canvases he did it with precision and care that really took many years to develop his craft.   On this 23rd Birthday I don't even want to go out and receive gifts or have cake in some ways. But in others I do....because the man would have wanted me to move on. He would have wanted me to Live and Party in a celebration of his life and not a mourning state of depression which i fear falling into. I am going to make an effort to go to my aunts house about once a week to walk the dog for an hour or so. maybe longer. That dog is the last real connection i have of my grandfather and i want to hold on to her because she is so lovely and encompasses all that he wanted us to be. She was polite, Loyal and good.   I want to thank the priest, although i do not know his name yet, for allowing me to read from the holy book of scripture at the funeral mass because it allowed me to know that god was there greeting grandpa @ st. peters in heaven with a light just like a lighthouse guiding him into heaven. I also want to thank my father for telling everyone how great my grandfather was. I also want to thank gregory because he went up there and told grandpa that we never got to say thank you to him for all of the time spent with him and the wonderful memories that he gave us by just being in our lives. Finally I want to give my biggest thanks to my brother, who really summed it up best when he said that my grandfather was the best man that we ever met. he was the nicest person we ever knew and will know. My grandfather was the best man in the whole world.   These posts will continue...   For now Happy Birthday To Me :(

      Today was supposed to be an easy day.. One more day on my way towards the weekend. I have been feeling so sick and tired and droopy thinking maybe I have mono. So today my grandfather passed away. He was eighty eight years old. He was all that I ever looked up to and all that I ever strove to be. I mean he was the ICON. Frank Schubert was the last civilian lighthouse keeper in north america. He lived in a cottage house in Coney Island, Brooklyn, NY manning the lighthouse . He was quiet and humble, lived simple but was funny and classic in the old time way. He watched football and baseball and loved to go bowling or play golf. No matter how old he got he could still kick our butts. He was the biggest thing to me, he was the only one who I ever cared what he thought or mattered to. That may not make any sense but if you knew Frank Schubert you would know him as a guy who was always there willing to help you, not only by giving you money or food but by showing you how to work, to build, to fish or cook. I am so happy that I could spend all 23 years of my life growing up with him . We built picnic tables and benches, we built coffee tables and picture frames, we even built a dog house for my puppy. He taught me how to golf and bowl, always being patient with me and really guiding me, adjusting when I lost my temper. He was a real man and someone that I will miss for ever. It is rough knowing that my children and my brothers & cousin's children will never get to meet the man who was so bigger than life. All I can say now is that he is up in heaven with my grandmother who has waited so many years for him to come to her. I just wish people would know who he was all the good and the very little bad. He was stubborn and we have all inherited that trait from him and he maybe did things differently his way was not always the best and probably could have been better. Frank Schubert was always himself never bowing down for anyone and never giving up his stance, no matter how wrong or right he was. He was a beautiful artist, creating masterpieces of woodwork, and paintings. I finally feel like man, maybe his passing is forcing me to stand up and move up in the world.. or maybe it is just giving me the strength to harness my power and talent and creative mind and go out and become the man he wanted me to be. I love frank Schubert and must say that he will be missed forever by me and by many other generations to come. Rest in peace and may st.peter and jesus welcome you with open arms.   Liz sent me this prayer and I wanted to share it with everyone so that they can remember to keep Frank Schubert in their prayers.   O Christ Jesus, when all is darkness and we feel our weakness and helplessness, give us the sense of Your presence, Your love, and Your strength. Help us to have perfect trust in Your protecting love and strengthening power, so that nothing may frighten or worry us, for, living close to You, we shall see Your hand, Your purpose, Your will through all things. Amen.

      So the other day I go to Seth's Blog and he is talking about how is birthday is 4/26, as in April 26th. So then he continues to mention how in Genesis 4:26 it states that "and seth then had a son whom he named enosh. that's when men and women began praying and worshiping in the name of God."   He also wrote the following quote....."am i supposed to name my son enosh? will that mark the beginning of a new renaissance? am i just way too analytical? do i need to find more to do?" So Under the comments section I posted this.. ...."you have to name me enosh... otherwise we cannot fulfill the prophecy...." I thought it was great lol .   I need suggestions on what to get my boss or his newborn baby for chanukah/christmas. He has been hooking me up with some major tix to events this year and I need to figure out something that he will really like. Any Suggestions....

I need to go out and talk to people...  Go to school and make Slide Copies of All The Artists that Interest me..   Help AJ with his documentary ....  Relax....

      I am torn between my ideas for a profession and the moral obligation of what is right and wrong. Two days ago, I was riding on the B train coming home from work. So half way through the ride, some kid across the way from me pull out a digital mavica from Sony.  So I know that he is probably going to take pictures, and I sometimes want to take pictures on the train so I understand his urge. Then he is futzing around trying to be sneaky and I cannot see who or what he took a photograph of.  As we pull into the next station  he gets up and starts to walk out, when I hear the guy next to him say outloud to his friends "He just took a picture of him" with his finger pointing directly in my direction. At first I was shocked and a little angered but then I thought well what's the difference, I always want to take photographs on the subway and I never want anyone to yell or stop me from doing it. The whole documentary process is supposed to be unmodified, original, bare and raw. I love that aspect of photography and I wouldn't want to yell at the kid for doing what he did. I just don't want to end up having my head photoshoped on to someone else's body for some weird magazine or publication.. Say he is doing a publication on Racism and I suddenly become the racist on the subway or an adult male magazine, those are two uses that I certainly do not ever want my image and my likeness associated with.

      I am not feeling well, think I am getting sick again....It's okay because I will be seeing the doc manana..   I thought about it today and I am going to definitely sign up for the seminar on Mac Repair.. I hate my job, well I hate the job that I am expected to do and not allowed to really utilize my schooling or my brain. So I am going to start studing and take the Apple Certified Tech course and hopefully get some work doing that along with my photography when it is all over.

      I was on the train tonight when I was listening to Elliot Smith's "needle in the hay" and I was thinking about how if I didn't download the song from iTunes, I could actually have some cover (album) art to look at. Then it hit me... they say that downloading music is hurting the artist. but in reality it is just hurting the pocket of the big time corporation, the five major labels control most of the flow of music to our machines (radios, boomboxes, cd players, mp3 players). They promote what they want and give us what they allow. But by downloading music people were able to create a cult following of a new artist or push some songs via email to a friend in another state who would never have a chance to borrow the cd. The reason I titled this "Downloading Music Lent A Hand To The Consumer" is because 2 out of the 3 recent CD purchases have come with a bonus DVD full of video footage. Although at times the footage is raw uncut stupidity, it give me the consumer and ultimate fan a peek into the shananigans of the artist who i so admire.   so All I can say is that if we weren't downloading music (illegally or not) and trading it via technology, we would be stuck paying $16.99 or $12.99 for a cd of 10 songs with no DVD and we would probably only like 6 of the songs anyway.   until next time..

      I am sick today. I have the flu. How many of you can remember using a thermometer that was stuck in your butt with vaseline..?? That sounds totally weird and disgusting,  I know. The topic was brought up during conversation tonight because me and liz were commenting about how we used to have to have our parents take our temperature. Liz said her mom think it's the only true temperature, and how when we have kids they will think we were barbaric and strange, because they will probably just use the ear thermometers that are sold now in stores. I then said we need to keep using the anal thermometer for sick temperature readings so that they will know the bone chilling cold feeling that is experienced when you have your temperature taken that way.    In other news... I am trying to update my blog and make it better and more stylistic. I am checking out other people's blogs and trying to view the source and understand it and then work with it on my own. So if it looks funky.. that is why.  Hopefully, I can get some rest. I have work in the A.M.

      Tonight, I went in search of the newly rumoured Starbucks    in brighton beach. This will mean, I will have my very own starbucks to use as a station for fermenting my thoughts and for firing up my brain's neurons. I am so excited that I will finally be able to walk several blocks from my home to get a nice cup of the starbucks java. To some this may sound sick & hedonistic but since I live in a neighborhood with immigrants who speak a language that I cannot understand and cafe's have signs written in a language that mostly resembles klingon... I will be happy to have a semi simplistic cafe to sit and ponder life, art and theory. The rumor is that it will take place in the old stationary store where I bought all of my school supplies, from the time that I was in Kindegarten until I was about 13 when Staples moved it's way into the area.

I hate getting frustrated because all of my friends are working part time jobs so that they can spend time doing and thinking creatively. I am just jealous.   Well off to bed because tomorrow is a big day with a huge truck delivering magazines which will have to be sorted by Yours truly as well as Esteban & Billy Boy.

      Tonight was the end of a great weekend. We all hung out at Casa de Chris and watched the season premiere of the Sopranos. I am not disappointed but anxious to see how the season plays out. It is hard to go back to a show after it being off of the air for over 18 months. I think it should be good, I can't wait because another great show is going to come out on DVD. The second season of Six Feet Under shall be released sometime within the first week of june,  I am preparing to send back all of my Netflix so that I can have the six feet under season first on my yet to be rented list.  I wish there was a way that I could get the designers from home make over to come and only redo my room. I need someone to come in and see the space I have and work with me so that I can better accommodate my lifestyle. I also need a house keeper to come and clean my room once a week. I know it sounds cheesy but I am so lazy and I end up piling things ontop of other piles and never throwing receipts or papers away.   Hopefully the week will begin as good as sunday has been for me!

      We went to Caffe Cafe.   So Me and Liz and John are all sitting there talking about life and relationships and John begins to get depressed again. I tell him to just go out and live life and have fun and realize that if you need a girlfriend to make your life better than there is something else wrong with your life.  I love him dearly but he needs to go out there and pursue his dreams, personal ones that do not reflect what others want.   I bought the new MTV magazine not because it had Britney on the cover like Liz thought, but because it has an article about the howard dean campaign, blogging and EMOcracy.    I find it somewhat gut wrenching that MTV has a magazine out. Considering except for the reality television which I am addicted to, I am beginning to loathe the channel. I just think that the music industry and a lot of pop culture has just fallen to the waste side as the rest of america attempts to move on in a better socially aware mindset. Maybe I am just getting old but I rather listen to bands who create their music or who have a message to spread, usually a positive one and not one which glamourizes a lifestyle which few people can ever afford.    I am going to seriously sit down this whole month and work towards building a better chris. This means being more organized, reading more literature about social interaction and religion, and I will BLOG every day. I am an intelligent human being and I should have plenty that I can say to fill in a blog. I think along with the blog everyday, I am going to take a picture everyday... maybe post it ...  maybe not but atleast I can begin a photojournal.

You're pretty narrow minded  and opinionated with regards to music (and probably most other things  as well). But you're allowed to be, because you really  are  better  than everyone else. You take pride in obscurity.  You probably prefer vinyl too, you elitist bitch.

      No, I do not mean the tricky ways that you can go about creating links and do-dads for people to click on so that they will some how give me a penny for every time someone click's through to see a webpage or product placement. I am talking about a real job posting that caught my eye. I saw a job offered on a popular website which offered a job to someone who is a Blogger. Basically they need someone to blog and to become friendly with their core audience and work the mojo behind the scenes. Thus creating a tightly knit community of blog fans, whom are core audience members and thus reinforcing their brand image / name.   I actually think it is a great idea; I am not just saying that because I am looking for the job. I am saying it because consumers love to consume and the reason we like reality TV is because even though it is still television, we the viewer make a connection to its ideas, challenges, & cast members. We relate to reality TV, and having a blog as a way of communicating to your audience is a way of relating to them on a truly personal level.   I am sad though; I have been running this blog for a while and seriously neglecting it, and putting off posting a lot. I make no excuses for this, but I do work long hours at a job doing advertising support when I would much rather be at home blogging and connecting to my own personal community. I am going to apply for the job, even though I may not be the most qualified or the most knowledgeable right now in terms of formats and templates. I can learn all of that, I have the most important thing, a genuine caring and loving personality which all of my friends connect with. I can bring that to the table or should I say Mac and blog away.    I have made promises to blog everyday before; this time I am going to stick with my promise. Whether I apply for the job and get it, or whether I do not. I am going to force myself to sit down and learn HTML and figure out how to code better as well as really refine my writing by writing in a blog.

      I sit here typing after a long day of work. I worked all day to assist my boss so that he can then present his financial statements to possible investors in Paris. So I work like a dog so that he can make some $$ and potentially allow me to be out of a job. Idealy, I would like to get a severence package after a take over so that I can invest in some new photo equipment and some digital technology so that I can then get back to my art.   I crave knowledge of artistic realms well beyond my reach. Those where I actually have the dedication to stick with something and redeveloping it through many ideas and vision until I finally reach the final product.

      I am attempting to teach myself html.  I took a class in SVA on dreamweaver and I just hate using it. I think I need the brain of a mathematical person and I am more of a literal poetic person. Just when I think I figure something out and get it correct, i am totally wrong. I need an HTML tutor whom is not going to criticize my intelligence buy merely guide me and explain to me certain things. I need to read adn figure things out but I am still reading and I still cannot figure things out.   slowly but surely I will update this blog and eventually move it to my own server and work on that.   I need to take some classes on computer tech work. I think that is the direction, I want to go into with my career. I want to be a technology wizard for Photographers and Artists. Maybe bake some muffins and serve some chai lattes in my very own cafe too.   I am off to bed. I need my rest.   Goodnight All!!  -Chris

      I pulled up to my house tonight after a night of trying to just find myself creatively and mentally. I feel like lately I have been suffocated by everything in my life and I am not enjoying or living my life. I was suffocated by work which really is the main cause of the problem. That and the fact that I avoid all of my serious training.   Getting back to my point, I totally feel like living in Brighton Beach has pushed a severe amount of people into a thinking mode, a creative mode. Creating a counter culture hard working blood sweat and tears type of soul in a lot of the men and women that have grown up in Brighton Beach.  I was getting out of my car when I saw Mike a local kid who I grew up with. Basically his whole family his sister and his older brother. He is totally in creative 20 something mode with his Trucker Hat to the side the Coffee in his hand and his mind constantly thinking.   I think about how there are many writers that I know of whom grew up in my neighborhood and those photographers, Film makers, Rappers & Recording Artists. There is currently a new production company which was founded by men and women who grew up in Brighton. It is kind of funny because the local high school has held the record for the high school which has graduated the most Nobel prize winners in America. (this may not be true anymore, I do not know) All of the artists that I know are not RUSSIAN, they are mixed european americans, phillipinos, puerto ricans, blacks, hispanics, guatemaleans, etc. I only bring up the fact that we are not russian because everytime anyone I know ever talks about brighton beach (other than neil simon) they discuss the "little russia" but I think of it more as the creative melting pot which is going to produce several creative minds which will be world known by the time of their death.   .....to be continued

      Why is it that I seem to think the more money I spend on equipment or tools the more art I will produce. I will not produce more art by purchasing a new tool or using a new tool. I can only create new art by going out and physically spending the TIME, ENERGY, & Commitment to getting it done.  I have to think of a new idea for a photography project. I am not going to spend money on equipment that I am not going to use but there are some things I would like. I would like a new camera body and a new DV cam. I would also like a powerbook or an iBook. I actually like the iBook better than the powerbook but not sure if It will be better in the long run.   I need a tutor for HTML.   I really need someone that I can meet once a week and go over the HTML and work on my project. I need that type of structure like a collegiate class. So that I can then make sure that I meet once a week and go over my priorities and goals and see what progress I have made.

It is just at this time that I truly wish I could be on quest for the knowledge possessed by the Bodhisattva!  Off to Starbucks with the boys to talk and try to just breath some fresh air of brotherhood and friendly love of those whom I have known since eternity.

      its the fact that I work in an environment where there is so much going on that it is not a matter of me not doing my work, it is a matter of me always worrying that I forgot to do something. I do so much bullshit and so much important stuff that the blend and prioritizing it, gets really difficult.   I want to work for a construction company where I can build things all day and work my ass off and learn and be able to actually construct something and feel like I accomplished something.   Maybe I should become an engineer or an architect.   -Chris

      I woke up in the middle of the night and was unable to sleep at all last night. I have horrible dreams that I never experienced in my life until now. Nightmares, I never remember ever having nightmares but now I wake up not able to catch my breath and dreaming of loss. Loss of loved ones, which is actually a reality and also loss of my home and loss of sense of belonging. I was finally able to get back to sleep around 5am. Sleeping for two more hours and then waking up with horrible asthma complications and difficulty breathing. I did my nebulizer and decided to just stay home today.   So sleeping was good and being in a controlled breathing environment with a hepa air filter and an airconditioner running made me feel better. That is one thing I truly dislike about work is the air quality and the working conditions. The place is filthy and no matter what they do it always becomes filthy again.  I just hope that in the future, it gets better, the working conditions that I am subject to will get better... I Hope!

      Last night was fun, Liz, Lisa, Chris F and I all went to the Muddy Cup. It's a great cafe in Staten Island NY. They have coffee and Chai and other edibles, but the best part is the atmosphere. It sort of looks very much like a cafe that I want to open one day.   urlLink The Muddy Cup  There is art up on the walls and and new artists being showcased in their gallery space. They have many different events during the week, Open Mic Poetry, Live Music, Indie Film Night, Christian Singles Night, & others. I liked it because it was a home like feel with people just lounging on the retro furniture which was probably purchased from across the street at the antique shop, or I think it may have been picked up from several yard sales. There was a musician playing and her name is Caroline Cutroneo. She sang some folk song and some classic sixtie's ballads. Liz really liked her, she said that Caroline was singing Ballads and that ballads are most often confused to be love songs, but they are really abotu telling a story and it just happens that a lot of the ballads are love songs. I never knew that and I loved it.   I am a mush and I love to be sentimental and the minute I walked into this place I was in heaven. I was thinking that maybe I am meant to not be an artist but to be a facilitator in the art world. Maybe I am put on earth to create a space that will serve as a creative community, where artists of all walks of life in the community can come and talk and associate and socialize and really just breed their creative minds.

      I am apologizing to someone who's blog I frequently read. I think of this person as a man on a spiritual journey similar to mine. We are at different stages of it, in different parts of the same country living in different nuclear worlds. But I admire what is done by this person and I want them to know that. I sometimes am hurt because I ask certain questions or I inquire about specific things and never receive an acknowledgement from this person or an answer to any questions. I have learned to ignore that and to just strive and push myself to be the person I want to be.   I am apologizing because in my attempts to learn HTML and to create the blog that I so desire, I am reviewing the source code from many different people's blogs. I am attempting to teach myself html through this process. I do not have the will power to make a change a night but I do try to.  I just hope that the people whom I borrow code from take it as flattery and not as an insult and not as me violating them but rather me wanting to learn from their creative souls.    Take it for what you will... I can only push myself to learn and make my own ideas come alive. Even if it means borrowing the living organs from other blogs to build my very own frankenblog.

      I am working late and don't really mind. I do not get angry when I am working late and I have work to do that is meaningful and not a problem, I hate it when I am stuck working late on a project and my boss goes home, and everyone else goes home and I am stuck here working late all by myself with no company and I feel left alone and abandonded. I also hate that I have an hour commute, which as long as I work in Manhattan and live in Brooklyn will never change. I will always have a ridiculously long commute to work.   I wish sometimes that I lived in the city so that I could just walk down several blocks or take a subway one stop to my apartment and begin to unwind earlier.   I have a lot of respect for my immediate boss Barbara. She is a great tough woman who has probably overcome lots of struggles in her life, and still everyday wakes up and battles to come into work and fights for us her co-workers. She fights for our dignity, our pride, our peace of mind, if she didn't start in with the publisher and make him realize the errors of his ways, I don't think he would ever realize that we are human & subject to pain and suffering.  I have been thinking about myself and my personal addictions and my personal luxuries that I take for granted and to whom I submit myself to every day. I think about these addictions and the way I give in and I say to myself that I do not ever have to give in to them again. I can stand tall and strike them down and overcome the obstacles that they present in my life.   I have people who love me, care about me, and whom are always there to be with. I need to work towards these goals that I have for myself and everyday attempt to accomplish one and to defeat one addiction or one roadblock that is preventing me from becoming the man and person I want to be.   I talk the talk alot, but I need to begin to seriously walk the walk. I need to grab a hold of myself and my pride and especially and most importantly my faith and allow it to guide me through these rough times and obstacle course that my life is on.  I am going to go back work now and hope that I can begin to defeat these enemies right now.

      I just saw the funniest commercial for Applebee's new Weight Watcher's menu. I mean the biggest problem with this country's weight problem, is that Americans think, they (we) can drink soda, eat refined sugars pound down the red meat with no exercise and expect to  not gain weight.  People need to add variety to their diet, starting with a lot of Vegetables and a healthy clean cut of protein, whether it is red meat or white meat. We also need to add fish to our diet and it will help. Cutting back on a lot of things, and just being openminded to what putting specific things do to us and our bodies. I have several things that I try to do everyday and make sure I do to make my life a better one and a healthier one. One of them is to always take care of my lungs and to do my asthma medicine on time 3 times a day, so that I will not allow my immune system to become weak. I also believe that if I can drink 128 oz of water a day. that is twice the recommended 8 servings of 8oz's of water a day.     Living in the "City", I find sidewalks helpful. This may sound funny but I have been to what New Yorker's (nycity) people call Upstate or the Country. And I hate the fact that in so many areas there are no sidewalks, so yes there is this great open road and country and backwoods but there is no place to walk. There is no allotted space next to the road so that you may walk side by side with the cars who spew fumes and toxins into the air.  So my recommendation is that they make it mandatory to have sidewalks either made of dirt or concrete, so that young suburbians can take a stroll and not be endangered of getting hit by a car.

      I have finally decided tonight that I am going back to school in the Fall.  I am going to go back to school and finish my degree, a lot of people assume that I have already completed college and I haven't. I am actually quite upset at myself for not finishing a degree and for giving in to the working world. I liked it and I enjoyed my time spent in the publishing industry, the whole one year that I worked. But I believe it is time for me to get my ass back in gear and to work my butt off so that I may graduate and finish school.   I really feel like I have slacked off in my studies. I want to get a degree and then begin to work towards a better life for myself. I am interested in creating my art but also in having a degree and possibly getting into art history. I am not sure what I want out of life yet, but I definitely want to have a career but which kind of career...I do not know.   I do know that the one thing that is stopping me from going anywhere or doing anything is the fact that I do not have a degree. i am a smart and sophisticated individual who should learn and really mold and cultivate my brain so that I can become a better individual.     I need an HTML tutor... if there are any readers who would like to offer me some tips, I would love to take them. I want to change somethings in my template but I am a slacker.. with no HTML understanding... it all comes out like greek when I read it on my own.

      Was reading in the latest relevant and just saw that a company has created a prog that enables me to copy the bible onto my iPod. I am excited about this because I carry my bible to work with me and frequently read it on the train. By being able to just read it on my ipod i will cut down on the weight in my bag.   So I just copied all of Genesis to it and I am probably going to copy Leviticus to it as well. I am trying to really read up on my old testament.  Then really bone up on all of my bible. I need to read atleast a chapter a week and possibly really and truly read it twice in a week so that I remember it. I feel like as I am getting older I am already suffering from Alzheimers.

      Well Yesterday, we experienced a blackout on all emails. Whomever created the spreadsheet at the office which contains all vital information as to which domain names we own and what has to be updated, mistakenly placed a 5 in a box that should have had a 4. So instead of saying that something needed to be renewed in 2004 it was placed in 2005. Our emails were never sent a warning so we ended up losing it. We have it back now but it will take several days before we can actually read emails from people outside of the work office.     I woke up this morning after a really strange dream... the dream spoke about how I was drifting away from people and falling apart in my friendships. I totally agree. I haven't seen my best friend in months and we are both insanely busy but failing to make time for each  other. We need to just call each other more frequently and deecide what the fuck we are doing with our lives. I also want to start saving money after I pay off my credit card bills. I am currently in a state where automatically a certain value goes out electronically like a bullet to eliminate them. This helps because I know that automatically the cash is removed from my checking and there is no way of not taking care of the bills.  The saving money comes intertwined with the dream about drifting from friends because I want to make a concious effort to do more things that my friends like to do. The number one for the coming fall would be Snowboarding and Shopping lol.   So Ernie... Here I come!!....

      Friday started off my weekend even though it was friday it was still the beginning of relaxation mode.   I learned something interesting... our company which is currently in the process of being taken over and bought out is going to be part of a larger company which is also going to own the Gallery Guides.  The following was what appeared in the New York Times art section Friday August 6th 2004.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Since Louise Blouin MacBain resigned as chief executive of Phillips, du Pury & Company in December 2002, she has been a woman with a mission: to take information about art to the masses. First she bought Art + Auction magazine; then Art Knowledge Corporation, which publishes the Museums Magazines; Spoon magazine, which deals with fashion, art and photography; and now Art Now Inc., publisher of the Gallery Guides, handouts at galleries around the country. The guides are published in seven regional editions: New York, Boston/New England, Chicago/Midwest, West Coast, Philadelphia/Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Southwest. Between Museums Magazines and the Gallery Guides — both free — Ms. MacBain says she will reach more than 12.5 million readers a year.  With all these publications combined, Ms. MacBain said she wanted to be the world's most comprehensive resource on art. She plans to put out the Gallery Guides and Museum Magazines throughout Europe, too, merging the publications where the markets are small.  "We'll be redesigning them," she said, although they will still be the same pocketbook size. "We're planning on putting more information in them, like a cultural Time Out." She said she planned to feature recommendations for nearby restaurants, along with listings of cultural films and documentaries and a section for art-related family activities.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I have already been on this roller coaster ride of a lifetime working for the Art Knowledge Corporation and Larry Warsh. I am very grateful for it and my mind keeps flip flopping on what I would want to do in my future. But for now, I am going to stay and ride this wave but develop my photographic eye and think about art as a textbook. Reading it, Viewing it, Observing it, and then dissecting what is observed, viewed, read and then digest them again.    Who knows...

      I am totally frustrated by the process of itunes and my ipod. which is not much to say, considering how frustrated i get on a regular basis. I am frustrated because, I purchased a brand new portable hard drive which holds 250 gigs of information. Figuring I could use it to store all of my itunes and my imovies and iphotos making it easier to access and handle everything.   Unfortunately, It isn't. My Ipod was working fine then one day it went berserk and needed to be reset. which is fine except that all of my songs are on my portable hard drive and everytime i try to reimport them into my ipod it takes forever and locks up. I believe this is because my mac is an eMac with only a 800mhz processor and two dual firewire ports.  both my portable hard drive and my ipod use the firewire which is probably straining not only the firewire but also the processor.   I attempted to copy all of my songs back onto my eMac's original hard drive but for some reason iTunes does not recognize them all.   so damn the man and save the iPod.. I need help....PEOPLE I NEED HELP!!!
