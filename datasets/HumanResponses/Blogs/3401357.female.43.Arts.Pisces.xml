      I love this show but it is so violent. I knew the murder of Christopher's girlfriend Adriana would be happening soon and it happened in traditional Soprano fashion. Out in the woods and shot to death.. Drea LaMatea is going to play Joey Tribbiani's sister on Matthew LaBlanc's new show "Joey."   There's gonna be trouble for Tony's cousin Tony B. He's got to go. Can't stand him. All this infighting is driving me crazy. I'm beginning to lose who is who. Too many bosses and boss wannabees.  The season finale is in two weeks. That means it's almost time for Six Feet Under. I love that show and can't wait to watch Nate, David, Brenda, et al deal with life, death and love.  off to see the Wizard, Dot

      CSI is one of my favorite shows but tonight's episode struck me as a bit weird. Did anyone else think the character of the murderer could have been a X-Files? Grissom called him an "anomaly"(SP?). The murderer (named Todd Coombs)had a twin embryo that never formed and somehow his "brother's" DNA merged with his so that he had two sets of DNA. His blood's DNA differed from his hair DNA and that is how he got away with rape and murder. Fox and Scully could've solved this one!  I wonder if this is the season finale or if there's another new episode next week. Tonight is Without A Trace's season finale.  If I only had a brain, Dot

      Everyone talks about this show and how the voting is off. The best have been voted off and now it's down to two, Fantasia and Diana. I felt bad for Jasmine but she lasted much longer then she should have. They're good but in my mind they're not American Idols. But then again, I didn't think Ruben and Clay were either and look at Clay...he's got a great voice and is making a name for himself. This has been so disappointing I really don't care who wins, I'll never buy their CDs anyway. The only Idol CD we have in my house is Kelly Clarkson's. Nuff said.

      I plan on blogging about TV shows, movies, music, books or whatever is related to the various mediums. Lately I've been noticing a lot of things in the media that are driving me crazy. I rant about it to my kids and they shake their heads either in agreement or disgust. This will be a forum for me to express my viewpoints (good and bad) about what I'm watching, reading, or listening too. You're welcome to shake your head in agreement or disgust as well.  There's no place like home, Dot
