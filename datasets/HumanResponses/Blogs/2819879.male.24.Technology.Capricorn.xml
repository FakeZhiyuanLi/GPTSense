      I was going to take a nap but soon realize that if i do fall asleep, won't be able to wake up anytime soon...  So...  I had a weird dream last night.  It was about me and my x-gf and Ken and his gf all went out to a summer vacation trip.  We ended up in a grand hotel of some unknown island, the sun is shining and there's no cloud you can see in the vast blue sky.  Anyways, it was a beautiful dream to start with.  But while I was sleeping in one of the hotel's room (Yeah, I dreamed about sleeping), all of a sudden I woke up and decided to take a stroll in the hall.  It was a couple hours past mid-night and there I was loitering in the hallway doing nothing.  When all of a sudden, all the doors starts to open and close and open and close on me.  Of course that scared the hell out of me so I ran to the escalator trying to get out of this haunted hotel... and somehow as I ran, I can see my friends outside of the window, on the grass, eating and chatting and having a great time by themselves.  I was desperate to join them and even more desperate trying to get out of the building (the doors are still opening and closing), and that's when I wake up.  I can still remember what the hotel looks like and I'm sure it's nothing I've seen before.  Weird dreams as it is...  Jeffrey. Out.

He excels in many things that echos his name, for example, play street fighter as Ken and study at Chem.  This picture is taken last winter in Osaka ... something train.  When we went there together.  He is going to be a successful pharmacist.  Going to tackle the big exam in a couple days.  Wish him all the BEST!!  BY THE WAY, He thinks that his eye looks like Jay Chou (the Pop-Music King) in this picture.

      "I'm so tired of working..."  She used to be a happy, grateful and determined young girl.  And I was shocked to hear those words from her mouth.  It's not the words that shocks me but the way she said it.  She sounds exhausted and desperate (of getting out).  If there's anything I have learned from the past 2 years of working life - it's that "People do change".  Little by little, piece by piece, many old friends of mine changed a lot after they start working.  Me too, although I have considered myself pretty resistent to change.  But even I can notice that I have sorta lost the passion I used to have, the fulfilling sense of completion is gradually fading away as well.  Believe or not, I used to be happy just because I learned how to rap a song; finished a boss from videogame; getting a new comic book.....  Doing those things nowadays... still excites me, but not as much... anymore.  Speaking of which, no wonder i'm getting a lot of "I'm so bored!!!!!" from my friends these days.  And I'm kinda scared... what will happen when the feeling has totally fade away?  Would I become a dull adult like those people I see everyday on bus, MRT and train?  Is it inevitable?

      17th eh? 10 more days to go before my dear mom leaves me alone...  Curretly at 78kg, still have 8kg to go before I win the "Grand Dinner".  Hmm... maybe I do have to speed up a little, it's been 3 weeks already and i only lost 2kg.  I've seen people (My Cousin, Julian) lost 20+ kg over a period of time.  And seriously, salute to them.  For some of us, to lose weight in a healthy way is really not an easy path to take.  As it requires time, effort, resistance to food and many many other factors in order to succeed.  Losing weight is both a mental and physical game, and DAMN for how hard this game is.  It's just so not right - how come (generally) all the food that taste best to me are considered to be "bad food" to my health. There must be something wrong with my blueprint.  My designer should have designed me the way that whenever I do the stuff that pleases myself (without violates other people's rights, of course), I become healthier and healthier. Or, at least, when I'm trying to do something to damage myself, the warning siren should be more immediate and "LOUDER PLEASE!!". For example, when i'm already overweight, whenever I eat KFC chicken, make me puke asap...  Hmm... It's hard to deny that I wasn't complaining. But no, I wasn't complaining.  It's just something to think of... maybe this universe or "GOD" or supernatural force or whatever u calls it, works in mysterious ways that my puny little brain will never be able to understand its true purpose and reason.  And no, I'm not trying to understand it. Because I don't have wings, so I would never try to fly.  Until then...  P.S. If none of you understand what I'm talking about, it's okay, me either...

      Last night I was talking to a very angry girl.  She said she has been conspired by her love-of-life and her best friend. Her x-bf was going out with her best friend for like 5 or 6 month before she "accidently" rat them out. "No wonder last Valentines was 3 of us going out together instead of we going out alone!", she proclaimed in anger.  Well, I didn't know exactly how to make her fell less furious about the whole thing.  So after she went on for like 25+ Minutes (I was playing WarCraft while she's complaining), I said "at least now you have found out the truth, start to look for another guy already, he is a total jerk and you can do much better."  But then she said, "If I never find out the truth, I would be much happier and we can all still be good friends with each other. Now I have lost my bf and my best friend in return of the truth, if that's the case, I would rather live a lie."  Because I was still playing Warcraft so I wasn't thinking much about what she said.  Afterall, that was just a super lame story going on everyday around us, people who go out with their best friends and so on... :p  But now I think of it, perhaps hiding the truth away would be for the best in many occasions. What if... she never find out?  Would that lead to a happier ending?  Just something to think of... while I'm drifting mindlessly on Elevator -> Scooter -> Escalator -> Train -> Escalator -> MRT -> Escalator -> Bus -> Elevator to office everyday.  And reverse the above routine while going back home...  Oh yeah, I had her permission to post it here, since none of you who read this knows her... maybe ...  Anyways... it's no biggie... She's a happy girl and I'm sure she'll be able to walk out of it in no time.  On the other hand, in many ways, I wish I can be as tough as she is...

      Somehow... this month seems longer than any others.  To me, May is a very special month.  1998.05.21 was the first day I've gotten my first gf.  And 2 years ago, it was the month I graduate from UBC.  Although all those things used to seems critical in my life, after so many years, they seems to be less and less important to me nowadays...  The question is... will anything happen to me... anything super special, this month?  So far, seems highly unlikely.  I'm too chicken to go after any girls.  I still can't fully make up my mind about the whole going back stuff.  I still can't c myself in 5... or 6 years...  Okay, there's one special thing - it's gonna be the first time I pay tax and fill out the forms all by myself, the first time in my life...  Not a very pleasant thing compare to those good old ones, eh?  The whole growing up thing... one has to face more and more unhappy things instead of happy ones.  Seriously, I want to write down some happy stuffs here.  But so far, the only thing I can think of ... is Nintendo's next handheld, NDS.  Hopefully, it's going to be super super super great.  But I read a stupid negative news on google about how the duel screen's cost will hurt Nintendo in many ways.  Since each and every cellphone, mp3 player... whatever, needs LCD screen nowadays.  LCD screen's shortage has made them more and more expansive.  This sure will be a big concern for Nintendos...  See? Even the happiest thing so far has its dark side...  I should give up just now...

      Like Starcraft... I find myself repeatedly going back to play Warcraft III.  Blizzard is really an awesome company, I have to admit.  I've made a bet with little Jeff that I'll lost 10kg before he gain 10kg.  Somehow, I'm confident that I can win this bet.  And by the way, it's the biggest bet I've ever had in my life.  And lose 10kg won't be easy...  Time really flies...  Day after day, week after week.  1 hour seems like nothing nowadays.  And a week or 2 seems not so far away.  I have this theory that "as we grow up, we get used to 'time'".  Like when u sit in hot water (bearable hot water) long enough, you don't feel hot anymore - when we have passed enough time, we don't feel time passing by anymore.  Time & Spaces are... miracles... if God is almighty, would He be able to turn back time?  Funny whenever I starts writing on blog, I feel like ... sad ...  Interesting, gotta investigate how come the way things are the way they are...

      Cloudy and Windy all day.  It's my first time this year riding scooters all the way to office.  Rather Stupid, I think.  The reason of doing that still bothers me.  Maybe it's because I'm going to Dan-Sui tonight and may not be able to go home early.  Mom is coming tomorrow and because of her heavy luggage, I shall go airport and pick her up.  As a side note... I'm still not sure if go back for acturary is a good idea...

      So many notable things happened this morning.  But, first thing first...   Congradulations!!!!!!!!!!!! Ken has finally become a pharmacist!!!!!!!!!!! Sincerely glad for you!!! Well done!! Everyone knew you can do it!!!!!!!   This is a super important milestone for you.  Celebrate as much and as hard as you can~~~   Too bad I couldn't be there celebrating with you... but you know I'm so happy for you as well.  -------------------------------------------------------------  2ndly...   Will the damn slow turtle Typhoon ever come?   This morning I've meet the most incredible Sunny-Rain.  It was broad day-light and the sun is shining as hard as every other morning.  The sky was blue with a few clouds here and there, yet, if you feel closely, "THERE ARE RAINDROPS!!"  Thanks to the typhoon, that was an incredible weather...  -------------------------------------------------------------  3rdly, today is the first day this week i'm only 15 min. late to office...  That's not as noteworthy as the last 2... but...

      IF AI advances were to be made within the Matrix, and another war abounded then, with the same results, there would be a Matrix within the Matrix... and then another one, and another, until all you had was a spiral of Matrices beyond infinity and nobody, not even the machines would know what was real anymore...

      Finally......  My busy (?) days are over.  Everything seems to be coming to a nice halt right now.  Of course, there are still some follow-ups to do...  These are the things I have finally done:  1. Unblocked my ubc regisration. (FINALLY!!!) 2. Got ticket to Japan. (FINALLY!!) 3. Michael and Tony left.  Hopefully I can start working out again.  Shall not be too busy after tomorrow (Rola Left).  There are only 4 things on my agenda so far...  1. Rola's b-day 2. Jeremy's vacational weekend 3. Allen coming back (7/5?) 4. Register for courses (7/7)  ----------------------------------------------------------------  There was a super stupid police around Neo 19.  After Room 18 on last friday, I asked him if tony can take alcohol test to make sure if he can drive or not.  But he replyed (with very annoying attitude) "«ç»ò°Ý³o»ò²Âªº°ÝÃD£z?" "§A§â¨®¶}¹L¨Ó, ¤@¦¸©w¥Í¦ºªü".......  What a jerk.  I should have take his name down or his badge number or whatever...  Stupid and useless cops...  ------------------------------------------------------------------  On the other hand... if I were the cop, I can probably list the following reasons why should I be rude...  1. Working so late at a hot summer night really gets on my nerve, and I have to wear this heavy uniform...  2. A bunch of drinking rich kids who spend their parent's money and hook up girls at club.  Well... I reckon that he was just jealous because of stereotype.  If he knew that we were just some normal kids who want to drive safely and make no trouble for other people, he would probably let us take the test.  :)  ----------------------------------------------------------  I ought to put down some notes about °ò¶© and betelnuts, but i'll probably do that until my HELLO is fixed.  ... Jeff. out.

Actually Michael is a good guy to live with, Taiwan's living condition is not as good as other places, but he has no complain at all.  He won't bother my sleep hour.  He is quiet.  All in all, it's not much trouble living with him.  But still, I have 2 problems with his staying (But nothing personall, both are my own problem):  1. It's common sense that a guest coming all the way from the other end of earth, I'll have to take him out and stuff...  But everyday I still have to work --> and that is very tiresome...  Of course, I can choose to sleep early everyday and don't treat him at all, but... I choose to tire myself... it's no one's fault but mine.  2. That's another personal stuff... and it's a long story. Basically, my renter downstairs pays for my electricity - and she complains ALL THE TIME about how much electricity I spend in summer.  She was super annoying and always trying to deduct the electricity from her renting fee.  Anyways, so this summer, (because I don't like her at all), I tried super hard to use as little electricity as possible.  No Air Condidtion at any time if I'm alone in the house.  I would use Fans only. Until Michael came................ Of course, it's not polite to my guest if I don't turn on the air con --> For it is damn too hot in taiwan.  I'm not ¤p®ð, because I don't pay the electricty, gotta nothing to do with me.  It's just that... the renter is doomed to file complain this month... and it's not a pleasant thought... >  Anyhow, Tony & Michael, if you are reading this ...   Tony, next time tell me earlier about the plans. Dai Aho~~~~  Michael, we had a lotta fun together, and I think it's a very great idea to travel around in Asia before you start working.  Although my place can't offer you the best accommodation, I do sincerely hope that you had lots of fun and enjoy the stay in Taiwan.  I'll see you back in Vancouver soon~  Jeffrey... out...

And even better, by screwing them over, it makes you richer~  Appearence can be deceiving...  Honestly... I feel so sorry for Taiwan's MMO players.  In so many ways, they are just victims of the plot of the evil importing company.  Forced to play a game that lacks depth... the only fun you get is human interaction.  But that's the jewel of MMO.  If L II is a single player game, I wonder if it'll sell 1/10 of what they have sold now...

I think at the end the score was like 20 to 10 or something like that.  By the way, Ken, I'm not going to play with you for betting.  Like I wouldn't try to bet with you on basketball --> you are simply too good...

It's interesting to know that only 5% of mammel has 1 single mate for life.  If human genes can be altared the same way, is it a good... or a bad thing?  Sounds like a good idea to me...

Well... maybe it's a coincedence, if he has a SAAB Alchokey as I just posted this morning, (please refer to the previous article), he probably won't die.  Anyways, that reminds me of my uncle who passed away at around the same age last year.  He was because of stroke...  No Alchokey would have saved my uncle.  May all who passed away be able to rest in peace.

Well, in the movie, Aragon doesn't look like anywhere close to 87...  Although he does lived 210 years... so... propotionally, his appearance should be like around 40ish...?

      Yesterday night was the Last Fairwell party for John and Jeremy.  At CashBox Sogo, we sang until 2 in the morning.  It was pretty sad.  And I thought I'm already used to people parting.  I was wrong.  It still gets me when the time finally comes.  When there's a beginning, there's always an end.  Therefore, the only thing endless, would be something that never begins.  ...  Rather sad to be a mortal.  Maybe A. Smith is right; maybe human beings do define our reality through suffering and misery.  Of course, if this world is without suffering and misery, how do we know we are happy when the time comes?  If we are bind to and will never leave people whom we love, will we still precious the days we spend together?  Probably not.

      Last Monday, I had one of the most fun moment with Super Smash Brother Melee (SSBM).  It was major entertaining because, while I'm still the worst, all the player's level are fairly close to each other.  And we had one intensive fight after another.  It was really really enjoyable and super fun.  In the order of 1v1 strength:  Jeremy - Sheik, Ice Climber, Yoshi John - Fox, Link Jeffrey - Pikachu, Samus, Mario, Marth, Fox  At first, we played FFA, stock 3.  And John soon realize that Fox is not really good in FFA and changed to Link. Most of the time, Sheik or Pika win out.  Thanx to Pika's powerful thunder and Sheik's fastness.  The problem with Link is, although he does gets the most KOs, after either pika or shiek is dead, poor Link still has to duel the remaining player.  And unless he has some major % advantage, it's really a tough fight for him.  Link's cool down time, like pikachu, is too long.  And without a good come-back-move, no wonder he is rather weak compare with others of same level.  Later, we play 1v1 loser out.  Because the day before, Sheik really beat the hell out of my Pika, and I've had some Fox nightmare before, so I was reluctant in starting 1v1 tournment. But it turns out that I can really fight even (or almost even) with Fox!  And if Luck is with me, I can also beat Sheik!!  Pika is not a super bad choice of character after all.  And after the tournment, we all laugh at little turtle's choice of characters - punch-bag Browser and feather-light Kirby.  Smart choice... really... no offence...

      Still 1.5 hour to go, Friday afternoon, but I don't feel like working anymore.  Just had a pretty bad argument with one of my best friends, well, it was, rather unpleasant.  He was right on one thing: sometimes I do argue for the sake of arguement, even I don't fully believe the thing i'm defending for, I'll make myself believe it while arguing it.  Even though, I know very well that whatever I said wouldn't prove or disprove anything at the end.  And honestly, he is wrong on one thing: He said I've changed (in a blaming way, at least that's what i felt). He is wrong because:  (I have to make my points clear, so i list them out)  1. There's no need to blame, of course I've changed, after living out a different life, everyone will change.  People adopt to the environment and it should be a good thing.  One can't blame another just because their value is different.  2. It's not "I've change", even it is, it should be "we've changed".  Because, simply, in his eye, I have changed, and in my eye, he has changed.  3. I really don't think we have changed.  I find Grown up people pretty resistant to change.  And you really can't change a person much just in a couple days or months.  The world around us is different now, but we are still the same.  Anyways, I have to admit that it was my fault today.  Maybe the weary of getting out of this office is really getting on my back.  And... if you are reading this, I am terriblly sorry for ruinning your happy mood.  I wasn't being defencive, it was worse, I was being negative. I know you worked very hard last couple month, and finally it's pay-off time.  I should be, no, I AM happy for you.  However, what I've said was 100% true.  I don't think the chance of getting it is high, but if I can find a job I love and live close to the ones I love... what else would I ever want?  Well, I won't find out until then.  Humans are known to be greedy.  But, until then, that's just what I want... for now.

      Here's a little Luigi's Bibliography  Luigi Mario (Japanese: Ç¥Æû?ÇP) is Mario's younger brother in the Nintendo video games. He first appeared in Mario Bros as the second player. His role as the second player continued in Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Bros 3, and Super Mario World.   Luigi's name was inspired by a pizza parlor near Nintendo of America's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, which was called Mario & Luigi's.   Because of software constraints of the time, Luigi initially appeared as an exact clone of Mario, except wearing green instead of red. As technology improved, Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character, taller and thinner than his older brother. Luigi's personality has also developed, and he is said to be more nervous and cowardly than his brother; thus, he is rarely seen.   In Super Mario Bros 2 he was one of the characters you could control, characterized by a hovering jump. This feature made him quite popular amongst fans of the games. Luigi has starred in two games, the first of which was the edutainment title, Mario is Missing, released for the Super Nintendo and PC. It was a fairly lackluster game, involving Luigi traveling throughout the world and answering questions related to famous area he was in (Japan, Russia, etc). It was not produced by Nintendo, and remains one of the few "Mario Games" created and developed entirely by an American third-party developer. His second starring role was in Luigi's Mansion, released for the Nintendo GameCube. He also co-starred in a recent game (being a substitute for Mario doesn't count as co-star) called Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, the unofficial sequel to Paper Mario in which you control both the brothers equally to save the Princess again.   In Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, Luigi was kidnapped by Kamek the Magikoopa. He was freed by Yoshi after the defeat of Bowser at the Koopa Kingdom.   In the remake of Super Mario World for Game Boy Advance, Luigi is slightly more integral; you have a choice between Mario or Luigi. Luigi can jump higher and run faster, and he is designed to be the easier character to play as.   With the debut of Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64, Luigi also gained his own rival, Waluigi (Waluigi is a counterpart to Wario).   Luigi is also a hidden character in the N64 hit Super Smash Bros, and its GameCube sequel Super Smash Bros. Melee. He is a replica of Mario. His Green Missile move is an addition to Super Smash Bros. Melee. It is similar to Pikachu's Skull Bash. His taunt pose is the only taunt pose in the game that inflicts damage; it inflicts 1% damage. Unlike Mario's fireballs, Luigi's fireballs are not affected by gravity.   In the 1993 feature film Super Mario Bros., Luigi was played by John Leguizamo. In this film, Luigi's name is revealed as Luigi Mario, giving a convenient explanation as to how both Mario and Luigi can be known as the Mario Brothers.  I wish I can include one of his picture later..

      Luigi.  Mario's younger brother. Period.  That's what most people can say about him. But Luigi doesn't care.  He follow Mario around and does whatever Mario does, better or worse (usually the later one).  But the world is cruel, his popularity (???), I mean, too many spotlights on Mario, Luigi merely lives in his shadow.  Luigi is not a sad character, because no matter how much fames and fans Mario (even Wario) has steal from him, he doesn't care.  Doesn't care.  When one doesn't care anymore, one becomes invincible.  If you don't care about your lovers, how can she break your heart?  If you don't care about the result of any game, how can you really lose?  Maybe you lose, but you don't feel like losing at all, because you don't care.  Maybe Luigi does care.  And maybe as a compensation for the long forgotten Luigi, Nintendo throw him a Mansion at the dawn of GC.  But... like a big joke, that turns out to be a demo disk, shorter than any Mario games on N64 and SNES.  Poor Luigi.  However, he is still invincible.  He doesn't care.

      "Three rings for the Elven kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarven lords in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die.  One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie.  One Ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all  and in the darkness bind them  in the Land of Mordor where the shadows lie."  And so it begins the great story of the Ring...  After reading "The Hobbits" (Prelude of LoR), I just couldn't wait to get start on the Real Story.  Sure, "The Hobbits" was fun and a great adventure in itself.  Yet the Ring has already played a great part in the story...  1st Chapter, which I just finished yesterday, was all about how Bilbo (The first Hobbit to own the ring) was tired up because of the queer ring and how he threw a last, 111th birthday party and left the Shire.  The movie... was quite incorrect (perhaps misleading), about how the whole story started right away after Bilbo gave the Ring to his heir, Frodo.  In the book, Frodo's adventure does not start until 17 years later, when Frodo is 50-years-old (And that's the Age when Bilbo find the ring).  Well, movies are always misleading. While reading the story, although I was trying very hard to come up with my own "picture" of the characters, but I just couldn't help to refer to the ones from the movie.  Frodo, Bilbo, Sam, Gandalf, Sauron, Elrond, Pippy, Merry, the Dwarves have all printed in my mind by the evil movie...

      The following list will order the things I'm doing recently everyday, and most likely be the topics I'll be talking about recently (In the order of amount of time spend on it):  Working (9hr/day) - Interesting somethings, but most of the time major boring and sleepy.  Reading Lord of the Ring (3hr/day) - Basically all the possible time I spend on transportation (sometimes too packed to breath, let alone reading) + the time I sit on toilet. English version, of course.  I'm not saying the Chinese version is bad (never read it actually), but I've had some pretty bad nightmares with Harry Potter.  So, if you can, original version is always encouraged to read.  You wouldn't want to read English version of ª÷±e if you can read Chinese, right?  I've just finished "The Hobbits" - Prelude to "The Lord of the Ring".  It was... to be honest, better than all the Harry Potters I've read so far (that's all the Harry Potters published so far 1~5), COMBINED!  Actually, that's not a fair comparison.  While both settings are imaginary, the Middle-Earth just makes more sense to me than the Hidden-Wizard World.  After all, Mr. Tolkien's level is totally different than Ms. Rowling (or Mrs., she's divorced, right?).  He is an well-known English Professor and one of the greatest story-teller of all time, while she's just a casual -> professional writer.  But, as I've said, it's not a fair comparison - the target audiences of both books are different.  Lord of the Ring should be read by more mature audiences, I would say 15~99+. While people who are 30+ may find Harry Potter boring and doesn't make any sense here and there. Lack of structure is, in my opinion, Harry Potter's biggest flaw... I can keep going at this, but let's stop here for a sec. I'll get to my opinions on those books someday...  WarCraft III(2hr/day) - As I've mentioned before.  Like StarCraft, good games will not perish in a short period of time.  Ben, you should know what I'm talking about, take the example of Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike (How old is this game?). I'm mainly using Night Elf, {Mass Huntress}, basically these couple days fighting with Jeremy every night until 1 (when I HAVE to get to the bed).  Workout (2hr/day) - I'm still on the bet with Jeffrey, for 5000NT (that's why the 5k after my MSN Nickname), if i lose 10kg before he gain 10kg, i win 5000k and vice-versa. I find it interesting everyday how I'm so unwilling to go, but it feels really good when you get out of there, after a long and intensive workout.  Comics (3~5hr/week) - Death Notes, HunterXHunter, ¦º¯«Bleach, One Piece, Black Cat, Shamen King, LightSpeed Mask 21, Naruto... and many others...  GameCube (1hr/week) - Super Monkey Ball 2, Pokemon Co., Viewtiful Joe, Wario Inc., Soul Calibur. (I'm waiting for my SSM coming back from JOHN...)  Hang out with Friends (???hr/week) - Mostly drinking if I meet with Jeffrey, John, Jeremy. Mostly chatting and dinnering if I meet Julian. Mostly clubbing if with Jason.  Rola (???hr/week) - When she has time, I'll do my best to take out my time to fit hers.  She's another matter I'm so not sure what to do with, all I can do now is wait and see what'll happen later (later is like... 10 years?). Mostly Shopping and talking on the phone.  Basically, other than work, my life is full of Video Game, Comics, Novels, and a little love life (not even love life ba?).  That sounds horriblly like a teenager's life (other than the work part), I guess, I'm still a "Tweenager" - Teenager at their Twenties.  This Life is heading where, I don't know.  I don't want to rate it, either.  Because I believe there's no good or bad. Okay, there is, but who knows? Only Time can tell.  On a 2nd note, this life style won't last long.  It'll end by the end of July, to be exact.  And I'll be heading back to Vancouver by the end of August.  And we shall see what's waiting for me...

      Finally I have decided where this blog will heads to, after a little struggle, that is.  I think it's one of my dictinct characteristic, consciously or sub-consciously, to try to please everyone around me - even though that means I have to do something I'm unwilling to do, to some extend.  After I've read Washingtonesse's blog, I have to say, it has inspired me a lot - not about all the sex of "important" people she've had with, but about the style of her writing.  Obviously, she is having fun writing her own blog - sharing her joy and happiness and sadness for her friends who cares or who share the same interest. (And of course, she's having fun with all the sex and the luxury things she "HAS" to buy...)  I couldn't help to find out that my blog has been... a lot of... CRAPS.  Who am I kidding, I'm not a writer.  When I was writing my past articles, I have a more general audiences in mind - basically everyone I know of.  However, I think that's wrong.  This is MY diary.  This is MY life.  Whatever I'm doing, good or bad, waste time or not, stupid or smart, it shall all be noted here, if I want to.  On the other words, the goal should be to please myself, but not anyone else.  And if anyone who share the interest with me, will come back to read.  For those who don't, I don't blame you at all - for there's nothing to be blamed.  Crap or not.  This is MY diary. Period.

      When I wake up this morning, thanx to the dream I had, I start to hate myself.&nbsp; That's... a rare feeling...  I'm not a perfect person (and I don't know any perfect person),&nbsp; and I don't mind myself to have defect here and there.&nbsp; Sometimes I even enjoy my weaknesses, and if possible, I try to fix my problems like everyone else.  Back to the dream thing...  Probably because of the ice cream she treated me last night, I was rather moved by the ice cream (???), probably beocoz I haven't had any girl treating me so nicely since... a long time ago.  Ken was right.&nbsp; Even if I fail, I get something else invaluable in return... tho I'm still not sure what it is... or it's hard to describe in words...  Anyways, in my dream, I was fooling around with Claire...&nbsp;&nbsp;in my room back in vancouver, but the scene outside the window is still in taipei.&nbsp; And then, at some point of the fooling around process, I was going to praise her, for she looks really cute in my dream.  But then... I said my ex's name instead of hers...  She was furious to the degree that her whole body is shivering...   &nbsp; and I really really hate myself.

      How is this possible?  Once reminded, I can still feel the feeling clearly.  Of how much I have loved and loved by.  And then feels majorly down.  At least, I should be glad that it only occurs when I'm reminded.

      YAHOO~~~   My immediate boss just told me: "Don't have to finish the last batch of work!"   And that sounds like a message from heaven and the most beautiful music from godess~~~~~~   Guess I'll slack the last two days off then ^_^   Hmm... that sounds too unresponsible... I'll try to finish my work.   I won't let him down.   Wait... was that reverse psychology???   So should I slack or not?   Eh... probably ... i don't know... depends on my mood...

Btw, I was kinda decided that if I was dumped by Claire, I shall shave my head... now I was wondering if i should do it or not.  Coz it seems like i'm still going after her... we talked on the phone for like 3 hours last night until I said I gotta goto bed (actually gotta go warcraft...)...  Sign ...

Although I was nervous whenever my cell makes a sound, but I didn't get her msg until 11:00 at night.  Later we talked on msn until 2:30...  To make the long story short... basically she wants me to keep going after her, she said I have super big chance if i'm not leaving.  And I can still keep going after, she can accept long distance relationship...  Err... but the thing is... I don't think I want to go thru that again.  Long distance relationship is not possible for any man.  The ones who can endure it, ought to be called superman...  honestly, that's what I think.  And so... I have no current plan for her other than just wait and see...   Monday  ------------------  The beginning of the last week.  I was at office right on time~ (Good for me, a pat at the back)  5 days left, I plan to finish up all my work before the end of wednesday...  So I'll try to talk as little as possible on msn...  Add oil~ to myself...  Vacation is waiting right around the corner~~~

      Just got home...  Well... after I&nbsp;&nbsp;(sorta) waited all day, all i got is this msg from Claire:  "I'm back, let's talk on msn when u get home"  Actually I just msned her, but no reply yet... maybe it'll be wise if i just hit bed...  Anyways, since I'm waiting here... let me summarize what happened since thursday (proposal day) while I still remember...  Here it goes...   Friday  ------------  Working at day time, of course.  Friday was pretty boring as I remembered, after work, I go straight home because Saturday I have this Company Trip and I gotta wake up by 6:00 on saturday.  Played a couple round of warcraft at home, learned that Jeremy is coming back on saturday (!!!), that's a bit of surprise, in a good way, and then I hit bed by 11.  Oh, wait, Claire phoned me from °ª¶¯ wondering what happen to my DC, it's outta of battery all the time... Well, gets me worry about it a little as well.&nbsp; So I suggested her to get a Roll of Battery and just reload the camera whenever needed...  Seems like a useless and dumb suggestion.  Anyways, after the phone call, I went bed.   Saturday  ------------------  Wake up SUCCESSFULLY by 6:00 and left home by 6:30.  ¦n¤[¨SÃM¨®¨ì¥x¥_£{... ¦­¤WÃM¨®¨ä¹êÁÙÆZ¹LÅ}£x, ¸ô¤W¨®¤Ö¤S¨S¤Ó¶§... §Úªº NeoÂÅ¤Ñ¸¹... ¹ï£{, §ÚÀ°¥¦´«¹L·sªº¥k«áµøÃè£{... ³o¼Ë¤~¤£·|³QÄµ¹î§ì...  7:30 §Ú¬O²Ä¤@­Ó¤W¹CÄý¨®ªº!!!

      OK... I have proposed.   In the least genuine and proper manner...   ------------   We spend the whole day together in a hanging out fashion. Lunch at a quiet resturant and chat till 4, then we went to bookstore for she's looking for a travel booklet to GaoHsung. She's leaving to GH on a 3 day trip with her sis, and that's why she needs a guild book to go around.   During our time in the bookstore, I offered to borrow her my dc... so we ended up in my place. And that turns out to be a really bad move...   After taught her how to use dc, we ended up sitting there doing nothing but chatting mindlessly again. And since she's on my turf... somehow I felt encouraged and suggesteds to go rent a dvd I was talking about back in the resturant. And so we did...   Just Merried - DVD  3 sandwich (Dinner)  1 bag of snack (Blue one for fitting her cloth color)  and  4 smirnoff ice (2 lime, 2 lemon)   are with us when we come back to my place.   At this point I realized that I should have proposed during lunch time, or at least during the movie.   It was a funny movie and so I ended up paying too much attention to the movie than to her... how smart can I be.   So far I have missed 2 big fat chances already.   After the movie, we were drinking... she couldn't drink a lot... probably because she's tired already or something else. "It'd be perfect timing if I say it now", I said to myself. But... the phone rang... was stupid turtle and thank him so much for cooling me down...   After that, it was around 10 already... so I send her home...   ok... three times get it all. Now I am truely the fool.   Everyone been telling me:   it's good for u.  there's nothing to lose.  wouldn't hurt if u try.  be a man and spit it out.   And I admit some part of me really want to feel love again (no... not the dirty part, morons). But as I have stated, it's such an unbelieveable bad timing. 30+ days I have left in taiwan, why do I bother?   Anyways, maybe it's the alcohol, or maybe I was too tired. Later that night, I proposed to her over MSN. I should have at least call her.   After a long silence, she said she's surprised (I don't really believe this part, because I was rather obvious. Maybe she's surprised of how stupid I am proposing over msn...) and she'd like to know when did I start to have this feeling...   I couldn't answer the question... why is that important??? Does it really matter??? So what if I start to like you 10 days ago, 100 days ago or 100 years ago???   At least to me, it seems irrelevant... But, I'm not a girl...   Since I couldn't answer right away, I msn back telling her that we better discuss this matter over the phone, and she said sure.   So I called her back.   What kinda lame answer I told her, I have nearly forgotten. I probably said I've had this feeling since our last reunion about half year ago. Yeah, that seems about right.   And after that, both of us purposely avoid to discuss back to that matter and we ended the conversation in peace...   She's going to tell me yes or no, after she come back from GH. And I really really really wish the answer&nbsp;be a big NONO.   If she said yes, I would feel so sorry for her. And I'll try my best to repay her... and that... would majorly hinder my plan of becoming a Warcraft Master... and GC Pokemon Master... (GBA Pokemon Master, I already am)...   Wants to be loved.......... that's a weird feeling I never remember I've had before.   And probably the only reason that had driven me into this mess.   --------------------------------------------   Later that night, I had a weird dream (dreams are&nbsp;mostly weird). The weirdest thing about the dream is that all my longest and best friends showed up. In the order of appearence in the dream: Young, Dean, Ken, Jeffrey...   I was taking a math exam, seems like a math final.   Young and Dean was taking the exam as well,&nbsp;they screwed me around by hiding my pencil-case (haha, haven't had one for long) and so I had a super late start.   I saw Ken was out side waiting for me. And as everyone finished up the exam, I was the last person left in the classroom still struggling with the test. (Somehow I can still remember some questions, they are really simple, but I just couldn't answer)   And&nbsp;as the whole classroom emptied out, the teacher sits impatiently in front of me (but she told me to take my time, no hurry). And that's when Jeffrey bluntly bumped into the classroom, sat beside me and the teacher, chatted with her a little, and&nbsp;left. (What the hell is he thinking and doing here anyways?)   Ken is still waiting outside and I really want to finish up the exam.   And that's when I noticed it's 8:10 in the morning already... man... I really want to finish up the dream. You know, I'm sure if I fall back to sleep, I can finish the math exam and see what's waiting for me... but... I have to come to office... damn...   Sign... life sux...   It's always so hard to reach what you really want, and sometimes when you really get there, you find out it's not any close to what you have expected.   ... cheer up ... at least I have did it..... no matter how lame it was...

      I dreamed about something really funny...   Not sure if I were in the dream or not, but it's like in one of the teenage-killing movie (Scream, I know what u did last summer.. etc.)...   I (or someone else) was in a tropical resort and that's when an Alien Shark, super smart and fast killing hunting us down one by one.   There's a scene that the whales come bumping on the shore and ask for Whale-King to help them defeat the Alien Shark... and so on...   Funny dream. Tho I was a little scared when I was IN it.   Also I've had another dream about little turtle ere I woke up, and... that makes me worry a little, I'll contact him ASAP today.

       10 Working Days Left.   &nbsp;  And, that is IF I take no more days off.&nbsp; Slacking off at the end IS my problem.&nbsp; I wonder if I can overcome this or not.  &nbsp;  Make a&nbsp;bet with&nbsp;myself, if I cannot come to office everyday for the rest 10 days, then I'll shave my head bold.  &nbsp;  Actually it's 9 days if I go °ª¶¯ with Claire this Friday.  &nbsp;  36 Days left in Taiwan.&nbsp; And now I'm going after this girl.&nbsp; That seems not very logical.&nbsp; As usual, there are no means to justify my action because I can't justify my action.  &nbsp;  If everything goes well, my blog will become Love Log soon.&nbsp; However, it won't last.  &nbsp;  And everything won't go well, I presume.&nbsp; I've talked with her on phone for 2 hours yesterday, and already I feel tired --> this is such a waste of time and effort.&nbsp; I'm not saying going after girls is waste of time, but going after a girl that'll be parted soon is, a waste of time.  &nbsp;  And at the end (if everything goes well), I'll just hurt her and hurt myself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So why am I still doing it? &nbsp; ........... ....... ... &nbsp; Because I'm lonely, I guess.  &nbsp;  Last Friday I was joking with my ex-gf that I'm going after her again.&nbsp; And she replied firmly that she got a bf already and I should quit wasting my time anymore. &nbsp; And that was the moment I felt the lonest ever since she left me. &nbsp;  Love is the cure for loneliness, therefore, I'm seeking a cure.  &nbsp;  There, I have probably justified my action... &nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, I'm rather sick and tired of the whole "slowly-getting-to-know-each-other" process.&nbsp; That's why I felt tired after just spend 2 hours on the phone with her.&nbsp; We could have speak longer, if I didn't quit.   Speaking of the phone call... I have to admit that the things we've talked about was relatively interesting.&nbsp; It could be super obviously already that I want to go after her, ergo, our conversation was mainly focus on what each other thinks of relationship, marriage, kids and future... &nbsp; So all these weird questions like: &nbsp; "Would you look down a&nbsp;girl if she goes after you?" "Would you mind if your wife's salary is higher than you?" &nbsp; Somehow, it seems to me that she wants to take it slowly, step by step. Seriously, I don't mind, and I think it ought to be fun at this point, ere we become a couple. &nbsp;  But the problem is:&nbsp; Time, I DON'T HAVE. &nbsp; And&nbsp;she knows this as well as I do. &nbsp; This problem makes the whole going after process rather awkward and unnatural. &nbsp; So......................................... I decided to speed things up a little.  &nbsp;  Success or fail, I don't really mind.  &nbsp;  Tonight is supposely our first informal date (going out alone).&nbsp; We are going to watch Spider Man 2 (what a romantic movie).&nbsp; And  I'll propose. &nbsp;  Let me rewind a little....&nbsp;  She asked me to go °ª¶¯ on a 3 day trip this Friday.&nbsp; I don't really want to go because her sister is tagging alone.&nbsp; Not that I do mind about her sister, it's just that I don't like going out with odd number of people because 1 will doom to feel left out at some point, especially when you guys don't know each other THAT well.  &nbsp;  Plus, I have a company trip to attend this Saturday.&nbsp; Going °ª¶¯ is rather troublesome for me. &nbsp;  Plus, haven't I just decided that I'll come to office everyday for the rest 10 days???  &nbsp;  Well... if she or her sister find another person to come alone, I might think about it again.&nbsp; After all, I am going after her.&nbsp; &nbsp;  ... back to the proposal part.  &nbsp;  Here's my plan for today:  &nbsp;  - 6:30&nbsp;Dinner&nbsp;at Burger King  - 7:40 Spider Man 2  - 11:00 Coffe Shop in ¾ðªL  - 11:30 Propose  &nbsp;  Seems like a perfect plan~&nbsp; I'm especially fond of the Burger King part.  &nbsp;  ...  &nbsp;  Anyways, I'll c... it seems like a pretty screw-up plan at this point.  &nbsp;  I want to spend some time to describe Claire in detail, but I'll do that if I have time in the afternoon.  &nbsp;  If I didn't do it in the afternoon, and if I didn't success tonight, the reason to do it may not exist anymore.  &nbsp;  That's... that for now, I'll think harder later...

      Haven't had a long and meaningful blog since forever... (all my blogs are meaningless, that's the feedback i'm getting)...  Anyways... technically, I'm very much look alike going after this girl... (since all my friends told me to do so, regardless i only have 40 days left in taiwan... good friends...) but it's still undeniable that i'm still under the affection of my ex-gf...  This is so unfair.  [today is so hot]  If I fail, I have wasted my precious time.  Even worse, if I succeed, we'll still be apart in about an month.  Well.. but since I have choose to ­AÄ_, I'll keep ­AÄ_ till the end, i think.

Fooling around is just a waste of time, and she won't give in as well.  That's not what she wants, and me either.  Guess I'll stay focus and be content by warcraft and pokemon then...

       §ä¨ìªº·P°Ê   Anyone whose been hanging out shopping with me ought to know, I was looking for this DVD for so long.  And thank goodness I had never give up!  The DVD's title is "Man of Honour", a rather old movie.  I been looking it EVERYWHERE!  All the major stores that sells DVD around Taipei Train Station, around SOGO/²Î»â, in ¤hªL©]¥«, °ò¶©©]¥«, and all the video stores in my hometown, ¾ðªL.  Alas, my search was in vain.  Did I forgot to mention the reason?  It was nothing serious, just doing a favour for someone who is/was very important to me...  Luck always appears at the most unexpected moment.  Today I was circling around ¤º´ò... (for some not so bright reason)...  And around noon, I was hungry for I haven't been eating for 16 hours already (on diet).  So I decided to go to this spaghetti place I've been to once before.  But unfortunately, it was not open...  Since I'm still on diet, I don't want to eat anything big, so I changed my mind and decided to go to 7-11 and grab some light-lunchbox.  Anyone who lives in Taiwan shall be as least familiar with the process.  You grab a lunch box off the shelf, pay at the counter and wait for the cashier to microwave your lunch box.  Nothing special.  So I was waiting for the lunch box to be microwaved and so I was looking around, browsing the store. There I noticed a small busket beside the counter with lots of DVDs on sale.  "Well...... what the hell...", I thought.  And so I was reviewed each DVD's title, because the busket was messy and unorganized, it's easy to look over any DVD.  And ... I couldn't believe my eyes when I have found it.  "It's a miracle!!!", I almost shouted out.  Well, I did shouted out inside my heart. ^_^  But there are cashiers and other customers around me, so I have to act cool.  Realized that I didn't have enough money with me, I ran out to my scooter (forgot my lunchbox) and rode to the closest ATM I can find.  When I was back to the 7-11, the cashier looked at me with two query eyes.  Well, I was too happy at that moment so I explained to her how long I've been seraching for this DVD...  And FINALLY...  GOT IT!!  MAN OF HONOUR, ¤J¤â! ^_^

      This very morning, Asia-Pacific Japan's new Leader Ottosan (sounds like this), has arrived to our Taipei office and gave out a quick speech concerning what's HP's strategy in the next half fiscal year...  Eh... the thing is... at the end of his speech, there was a time left for open question.  As a habit, my fellow Taiwan co-workers were all reluctant to ask anything ere forced by.  I had a couple rather good question in mind... but for some reason, I had not the courage to spit them out...  I can probably think of 10 execuses to that, but still, execuses are ... only execuses, they won't change the outcome.  It's not that I want to show off or anything, but somehow I feel regretful and uneasy for not have the guts to stand up.  Just... stand up...

      My back hurts......  Yesterday came the most incredible lighting strom shower I have ever seen.  Blazing thunder lightening the night sky while huge rain drops falling like crazy...  Anyways, it was jaw-dropping.  However, I had neither the time nor relaxing mind to enjoy the amazing storm, because around 23:30, I found that the water has already filled the balcony and almost flooding into my place...  So as the weariness blinded my mind, I grabbed the towel from washroom, left it besides the door, and ran into the stormy balcony with only a mobbing bucket and my underwear.  When I have reached the balcony, I was all soaked and cold.  But the coldness has soon disappeared because I tried very hard to keeping filling up the bucket and pouring the water to street.  After working like a madman for about 10 min, my back hurts, my arms are shaking and I can barely stand the rain anymore.  Even worse, I realized that my bucket strategy wasn't helping at all!!  The bucket was big, and the water I can fill up each time were at least more than 2 Liter.  2L per 10 sec.  Each minute I can remove 12L of water and within that 10 Min. I have at least removed 120L.  But it was useless, the water was still full to the brim and ready to pouring into my place anytime...  I may have only slowed the process...  And that was when I finally start to think.  Even if the bucket works, if the rain don't stop, how long can I stand there in the rain working like this? I couldn't have last 20 ... at most 30 min.  I need to let the water drain itself.  But it was too dark and I couldn't see a thing.  So there I was touching every corner of the balcony and feel with my hand.  With the help of random lighting, I found a big hole, or a small tunnel, against the wall, leading the water to the other side of the room.  I couldn't tell if the water were running out of the hole or coming from the hole, but either way, i have to clear it.  But as I put my hands and arms into the tunnel, it was NOT blocked, which means the water have filled the other side as well!!  The other side of the wall is another bigger balcony, at least 3 times bigger. If I don't find and hopefully clear the outfall, water will fill up my apartment and I'll be living in water world the next day when I wake up...  Running to the other side, and quickly I started searching for the scupper.  Luckily, I found it lay right beside the tunnel which connects to the smaller balcony.  And it was choked with leaf, mud and garbage.  I was rather angry at that moment and throw out everything I could find on top of the outfall and toss them off the street as far as I could.  After about 30 sec, I can feel water running into the outfall with my hands as it makes a HAPPY water-draining sound ^_^.  Later I sit there for about 5 more mins to make sure it's not blocked again by other things and until the water has faded...  Finally, Jeffrey (the stupid ass) has saved the night...

By the way, don't buy any new BMW or Mercedes in Taiwan.  They are fake...  That's... what I've learned from him today...

      This... shall be my last blog done at my office (where I did most of my previous blogs).  I started my blog at this very desk.  And so far, probably 95% of my blogs are from this desk as well.  I've chatted with so many people from here.  I'll miss this beautiful 19" HP OEM Monitor...  Well... that's the end.  Nothing worthwhile to celebrate.  This serves merely as the last of my footprint at HP, for now, or forever.  Goodbye, HP.
