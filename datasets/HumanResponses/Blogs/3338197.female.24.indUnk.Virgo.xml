      Here are the photos of Sean's horseplay - or should I say "dog-play". At Claudia's going away party - for a bet (~$25 in the kitty) Sean decided to see how an electric dog collar reprimanded the dog when it approaches the boundary wire. The manual describes it as "Your pet will receive a mild correction when it approaches the boundary".   The pictures depict what a 'mild correction' looks like on a hairless young lad that crossed the boundary on all-fours (doggy style) and on whose neck the electrodes make excellent skin contact. See if you can spot the actual 'event' in the sequence. :-)  www.unb.ca/geology/party

      Hey All, Back from my little trip to Montréal.  I vow that I shall never go away with the little Chinese man again.  He drove me nuts.  On the way back he kept on going on about all these Chinese geologists that he knew… funny thing was they were all the best in their field, the best in Canada and in fact sometime the best in the world.  And the second best scientists always seemed to have Chinese wives!  After the fifth or sixth time he called yet another Chinese scientist the best of whatever we were all having a hard time controlling the laughter.    On the drive back we took a detour along the St. Laurence River… it was breath taking.  It also allowed for me to see the world’s largest egg and the world’s largest husky dog… haha… I  thought only New Brunswick had a thing for having big dumb statues.  We also drove though this town that had the most wooden sculpture stores anywhere.  I had just made a comment on how many there were and then we stopped at a corner where there was one on each corner.  It was quite bizarre.  We stopped and had lunch in Pocataire, a very small French town, that only has a McDonald’s and a gas station.  Neither Karl or Xueming can speak French, so watching Karl try to order was funny.  Xueming just asked for the same thing but he didn’t even know what Karl had gotten.  I had no problems ordering since the meager French I speak is more than adequate to get by.  When we left I was driving and Xueming was trying to tell me how to pull out of the parking lot.  I was so pissed that I stopped the car and told him that I know how to drive.  FUCK, stupid little man.  I am so mad that I stayed away from the office all weekend because if I avoid him till Monday I won’t have to see him all summer and perhaps never again.  Gotta get going… should get some real work done since I leave for Bathurst next week sometime.

      So here is the second attempt at writing about La Belle Ville de Montréal.  This city is amazing, they have everything here I could ever want.  It would definitely be someplace that I would come and do a PhD, if I could find an interesting volcanology project to work on.  I’ll have to look into seeing what John Stix has to offer for next fall, I here good things about him and about McGill.  I also got to see Allison Rusk talk, and Cliff recommended that I look into studying with her… she does some neat stuff with bubble growth, surface tensions and the degassing in magmas.  Not that anyone besides a small group of people knows what the mean… but its very important in volcanology.    I haven’t really done any site seeing at all… I’ve been busy being a good little geek attending many talks… infact I am sitting in a conference room right now waiting to hear seminars on Mars.  The room is pretty small and always fills up everytime the Mars talks are in here… I’m not quite sure why they wouldn’t have it in a larger room as it is a flashy subject and draws a big crowd.  Ok… here is how geeky I am; there are a bunch of high school students behind me and I think that it so really great that they are interested enough to be here listening to acedemic talks about Mars.  They may not understand much but they are the future of science in Canada and it makes me excited that young people are really interested in this stuff.  My office mate who came here with me is driving me bananas… he is so arrogant and has absolutely no manners, not to mention cheap.  I had to apologize to a waitress this week cause he was so mean to her.  Then he told me to my face that he was Dave’s best and smartest student.  To my face!! I couldn’t even believe that he would ever even think it let alone say to my face.  So I told him to go fuck himself!  And that the only reason he knows more than me is that he is 40 and I am only 24… so no wonder he knows more than me.  This list of things he has done this week is long and it would make me look like an evil woman to sit her and list than all… but its not like I’ve never been called that before. HAHA….. well that’s all from Montréal.

      So, its midnight once again and I am still here working away like a busy little beaver... or slave, however you choose to look at it.  Why am I here so late???  Its either that I am a work-a-holic who is completely obsessed with perfection or that I spend the better part of the day 'fucking the dog' so to speak.  Frankly I think its a bit of both... especially since I spent a good hour and a half at lunch and didn't get here till noon. Hahahaha... you only live once and the little man (my supervisor) only goes away every couple of months... so I try to take complete advantage of him not being here.    I got my animation to work yesterday then changed the stills like 6 times today because every time I got through it I found a mistake.  I just noticed that the phase diagram for water I had in there was wrong, which make me realize that I know way to much about water... and no one really knows what the hell I am talking about so I'll just stop it.  Suffice it to say that its a MAJOR booboo and the little man would flip his lid if he new that I presented the wrong data to 400 people.    Speaking of which... that's 400 people I get to picture naked on Monday.  WHOOOOOOOO... that's a lotta naked people.    Nough for now...

      Ok... so I've been reading Tanya's blog and I'd have to say that she has me intrigued.  So I thought I'd give it a spin... though it may not last for all that long knowing me.  I'm at school, sitting in my office at midnight...supposed to be finishing my seminar for Montreal but I decided blogging would be much more productive.  Only two more days till I leave and I still have to cut like 5 whole minutes out of this thing.  It pisses me right off!!! Who ever heard of going to a conference and only getting 10 minutes... don't these people know that I deserve 15 minutes of fame. hahaha.    On the flip side... what's new here??  Just finished my first year of my master's degree... got a 4.2 GPA (love saying that cause I've never had marks that good in my life)!  Got to go to Italy to take some undergrads on a field trip.  Found out I have a huge crush on a friend...we will see how that goes....my love life has been pretty non-existent for the past 10 months :(  So... really have to get back to the presentation before I get all mega stress and the computer fucks up on me again... I give it another hour!   Ciao

      So I'm two weeks into another summer in Bathurst.  This summer I was thinking that I'd do things a little differently... like have a new attitude towards Bathurst.  How bad can one place be right?? Can't be any worse than Freddy.  Well its going good so far.  I don't completely despise it yet and I don't feel like an outsider, which is due to the fact that people from last year recognise me and know my name.  Today I walked into the laundromat and was welcomed by the same lady who worked there every Sunday last summer.  There is something some what comforting about being in a place where nothing ever changes.    As for the love life.. I'm still working on it.  I'm quite sure he likes me, short of having flashing signs go off to alert me of this LOL.  Everyone is starting to think I'm neurotic, which I am but I'm not sure why it took everyone so long to come to this conclusion.  I'm going down to Fredericton this week and I am staying at his house.  So maybe I should tell the story first.  My supervisor calls and asks if he can stay at my place and that he's thinking of subletting it from me for the summer.  His wife gave him the boot and he didn't know if he should go crawling back or walk away for good this time.  I already had plans of going down to Freddy but it left me with no place to stay, so I asked a friend if I could stay in her room because she's up north for the summer. Of course she says yes and just happens to live with the boy I have the big crush on.  This leads to sending him and email to see if it was okay with him but before he gets back to me the Ol' sup has managed to get himself out of the dog house.  So I assume that I'll just stay at my place but then the boy emails and say that the Ol' sup is back in his own house but that I can still stay in my friend's room, it will be fun to have me around.   So there should be no problem right??  WRONG my life is never simple cause I can't make it simple but it should be simple; there goes the neurosis again.  The problem is that I'm terrified, absolutely terrified about going to Fredericton to see him.  I know that I don't have to stay at his place and that it would still be cool but I'm scared.  So why be scared???  Probably cause I've never had feelings for anyone in my life before I did the deed.  I've always done things backwards or the wrong way, have sex first and maybe I'd like them later.  I made a promise to myself a year ago that I wasn't going to get involved with anyone till I knew that they had feelings for me and not just want to "feel" me.  After a string of bad relationships started the worng way I just wanted to do things right.  So I waited and waited and this wonderful person was sitting right in front of me and I lied to myself. I kept on telling myself that I didn't like him cause he wasn't my type.  I lie like a cheap rug, he's exactly my type, he's just not like any of the guys that I've dated that weren't good for me.  And that's why I'm scared, scared to be with someone who might treat me right. Scared to be with someone who'd be romantic, buy me flowers, take me out to dinner, kiss me just to kiss. Does any of this make sense??  As for the payback I have recieved no word on the screen saver or the sardines.  This leads me to believe that I am in for it in ways I cannot fathom... I may have started WW3 in my office LOL Things should be great when I get to Freddy.  Maybe sardines don't rot and smell the same way salad does.

      I had a moment of brilliance, well more like hunger.LOL.  Its 2 am and I am starving but I have no food and I'm not done printing (I really just started) and there is no food here except for some tabasco flavoured sardines.  But I am starving so eating the sardines was sounding like a good idea, right?  Nope cause they are fucking yucky and gross and oily and smelly... which got me thinking that even though the screen saver was great how wonderful it would be to leave Sean a smelly little treat??? Kinda like salad pay back for when he left me the rotten little treat and went to Morroco!!! So I put them in a little tupper wear dish in one of the drawers by his desk. LOL it should start to smell in here really fucking rotten in 2 or 3 days.  OMG if it gets hot its gonna smell like ass.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I am queen of payback.  PS jelly beans are remarkably filling.

      I figure that I should not break the tradition of blogging at midnight.  Things have been fairly relaxed around over the past couple weeks since Dave is away again, so I've been working a little less.  I even got to go home and see my family for a day!!!  Although, things are pretty hectic right now since I am leaving in the morning to go to Bathurst.  I packed most of my field clothes and gear plus the books and papers I need to finish my manuscripts.  I am taking way too much with me but I'd rather be prepared than get there and realize that I am missing something essential.    Writing a manuscript is rather difficult.  It wasn't really a problem when I did the first draft but since it received Dave's round of corrections its been pretty retarded.  He can be really vague about certain things.... he'll say this section is weak but offer no advice on how to fix it, or he'll say read Lentz (1997) and redo but I still have no idea what to do after I read it!!! I must finish this before I leave my office tonight.  I've been saying I am almost done for the past week but always find more to fix, diagrams to redraft, ect. But today is it... it must be done.  I'm still working on the love life.  I think he's interested but I'm not quite sure.  Some of his signs are there and other days they are not. I've probably had a million opportunities to  bring the subject up but never do.  Its way past a little crush, I really like him.  I just wish I didn't act like I was 12 around him.  Its like my brain thinks of great things to say but my mouth stops cooperating, so I walk around sounding like a blathering idiot.  I hope I can survive this.  Going at his pace, waiting for him to make the first move is definately the best decision for this but good god I am impatient.    K enough for tonight.  This isn't as funny as it usually is, must be the stress of trying to finish this paper.

      Have you ever sent an email and wished that there was an unsend button cause it was addressed to the wrong person???  Well if you haven’t you should try it sometime!  I’ve been emailing my sister back and forth a lot lately, Nessa the one that is hard to get along with.  They are always light and funny and its good to be forming a stronger relationship with her.  She gives me advice on Sean (the boy I have the big crush on) and keeps me filled on the latest Halifax news and I keep her up to date on my life.  Its working out great.  So yesterday I sent Sean an email and then I sent it to her to see what she thought of it (she’s doing a pretty good job of filling in for you, but she’s no replacement)  She emailed me back this morning.  Her response was It sounds nice...like you were glad to see him !  Sean also emailed me back and said the normal Sean stuff and I forwarded to her saying   Hey Nessa, Boys are so dumb.  I just wish I knew if he liked me or not.  I can't tell what he is thinking. GRRRR. I'll be in the office all day so email me back so that we can be amused/awake all day.  I was at the office till 1 am and got up at 7am.    L8rWorm  Except when I looked up as it was sending it wasn’t addressed to her.  It must have hit reply cause Sean’s address was at the top.  OMG OMG how’s that for funny.  Atleast now he has a pretty good idea that I like him and that I am a dumb ass.  What if he doesn’t respond and goes into run away mode??  So the day goes by and there had been no response.  But he’s been keeping some weird hours and emailed me at 2 am so he’s probably home sleeping and hasn’t gone to school yet. But I start to freak out cause he must have seen the email by now but no response. Then I thought should I send him an email saying… what the hell would I even say.  Hi Sean, umm that email was meant for sister cause I forward her your letters.  I like you but I was too chicken to tell you. Later Warna AHHHHHHHHH this fucking sucks, I wish he’d just respond as opposed to not write back. This was not subtle or in person the way I planned to tell him.   Then I decided to take the initiative and write him a letter. Better then waiting around for him to respond, right?  And the next morning I get am email back.  I sat there for a good 10 minutes just staring at the screen cause I had no idea as to what he was going to say.  When I finally opened it I covered my face with my hand and peaked through my fingers.  Much to my relief he feels the same way about me HORRAY.  Everthing just seems to work out in the end :)

      So the weekend went great.  Getting to Fredericton, however, was a disaster.  Before I left I had to print off the manuscript I've been working on. But my CD burner broke so I could burn a CD to print my tables.  So I took them out of an older version and photocopied them, only for the photocopier to run out of toner! AHHH... all this and I have to be on the bus in 30 minutes.  And my drive to the bus station wasn't even here yet but I made it on to the bus in time only to have the bus ride take and extra hour and a bit.  We got stuck behind 2 Canada day parades!!! I now hate parades, what is the point of having a bunch of people drive by in cars waving at you.  Its not like they are the good parades that you see on TV with the impressive floats and beautiful people waving at you, its you neighbor in his beat up Chevy smoking while tailing some shitty wannabe float while his kids wave at you wearing a company logo.  Then I got hit on by this gross old man with no front the who told me I was too pretty to be a geologist cause that's a man's job.  Does this guy even know me... good lord, he's kind lucky the bus was full otherwise I might have lost it and clocked him.  How can he possibly imply that women can't be geologists??  I don't mean to sound all ultra feminist cause I am so not, I realize that there are jobs that women physically can't do because we don't have the same physique as our male counter parts but geology is not one of those jobs.  When we get into Fredericton Parade #2 is blocking off the bridge and we are only 2 block from the bus station.  I had my bag on the bus with me so I asked the bus driver to let me off.  He said no cause of insurance - I could get hit by a car!! Do you see all the traffic that's not moving buddy HELLO we are stuck waiting for a parade to go by.  I had to sit there for an hour and watch all the stupid people again.  Man was a pissed when we got to the bus station.  And then I realized that I forgot my house keys and office keys in Bathurst and there wasn't anyone meeting me at the bus station.  So I walk up to school and luckily Sean is in the office and my spare set of keys is on my desk. SCORE.  As for the rest of the weekend I had a lot of fun.  Did some drinking, watched some fire works.  Edited my paper for the millionth time. Oh and chicken out from telling the boy I liked him (really not surprising). I ended up spending the whole weekend at his house.  We hung out and he's really wonderful.  He even cooked me spaghetti.  And there were comments from the peanut gallery about us including "you guys should just hurry up and get on with it", "can't you see your meant for each other", and my all time fav " but no one is allowed to touch you like that but Warna".  I guess lots of people figured out there was something going on before I did LOL.

      So today is the big day.  I'm heading to Freddy to see him.  I'm nervous, excited, terrified all at the same time.  I've know him since last July and all of a sudden everything is a little different. Hope it all goes well and that I have the guts to tell him how I feel.  My worst nightmare is that I freeze up and play all defensive. Breath... hopefully this will be one of those weekends that will make me exhale.  Version 5 of my manuscript is done.  Hopefully its a little closer to sending for publication this time.  It will still require 5 more drafts but I can't wait to get it out there.  It will be my own little piece of history.  All the celebrities out their get 15 minutes or 15 years but if you are a really successful scientist you get remembered for the rest of written history by some geek, a geek like me.  Ciao
