      Well,&nbsp;I hope everyone had a wonderful weekend.&nbsp; We had a surprise Birthday party for one of my buddies Saturday evening and it went really well.&nbsp; We probably shouldn't have climbed on top of the buildings though...could have shut the party down pretty quickly.&nbsp; Nobody got hurt so don't worry, anywho, we were supposed to go walking Sunday but we ended up getting side tracked with HALO for the X-Box.&nbsp; We had a good time of that though, we linked a couple of them together and went at it, 4 on 4 or something like that.&nbsp; Spiderman 2 is supposed to be playing at the theater on Thursday and there are a few of us that are probably going to be heading to the show.&nbsp; Been looking forward to this for a while, I just can't wait until X-Men 3 comes out, I wan't to see how good Phenix (formerly Jean Grey) is going to be. &nbsp; Well I love and miss you all, J

      Hello everyone, I know I've not really talked to anyone lately but I hope you are all doing well.  I've been really busy lately with work and extra sports so I've guess I've not made the time to stay in contact with you, I'm sorry and hope that this will kinda sorta make up for it.  For those that don't know, I've recently joined a swim team and am having a lot of fun with that.  We normally swim at least 2000 meters in an afternoon, not consecutively of course but fast, and on Wednesday's we swim for distance, at a moderate pace, something like 3500 meters.  Also, within the last couple months I was able to max out our physical fitness test (PFT) at a 300, and have started to run the perimeter of our base once a week, which is approximately 6 miles.  So far, my running partner and I have not been able to get below 42 minutes but he had never run under 44 minutes before I started running with him so I see that as an improvement.  There is supposed to be a challenge coming from our XO to the troops, that he can run the parimeter faster than a team of 5 or 6 could.  I was thinking about running in this challenge but I felt as though it would be unfair so I am thinking that I will run with the XO to help out his time.  Also I figure it will give the troops a little reality shock when we are kicking their butts :).  Aside from that, we have a back yard exercise (BYE) coming up this week and we will be pretty busy with that so I'm not sure if I will get to do any of my extra sports.  Well, I need to get to bed so I hope you will all get to read this and respond so that I need not send out hundreds of emails anymore...cough cough...yeah that's it.  I love and miss you all, Me :)
