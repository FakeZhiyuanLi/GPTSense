						   Some say that meditation gets you closer to God.  In the winter I started meditating. I found it to be very relaxing. Once I got the hang of it I could meditate for 15 minutes and be able to stay up 2 or 3 hours past my usual bedtime with no grogginess the next day.  I have read that you can achieve a whole nights sleep in a good meditation. Does this mean your talking to God? Is that God's goal?  I guess it depends on your definition of God and your definition of talking. Meditation can be anything you want it to be.  I meditate to calm my body, and clear my mind. I have an active imagination. I can get worked up over anything.  Usually something minor will happen, and I'll run senarios in my head which usually ends with me being stressed out. A quick meditation calms my racing thoughts easily.  I enjoy "Getting in the Gap" (no not the store) it is fantastic for people (like me) who have trouble focusing on nothing. A calm voice walks you through the the first verse of the Lords Prayer. Our-Father-Who-Art-In-Heaven-Hallowed-Be-Thy-Name. Between each word focus on the gap between the words, it's very powerful.  The slight hesitation between words allows you infinite time to let go and focus on the nothingness that is everything.  I don't to get too deep, but it's a great meditation if you want to try.  Japa is also a way to meditate. The repetition of the word of God or 'ahhhhhhhhhh'. I have tried this a couple times. You feel a little silly when you start but becomes natural very quickly.  That's all I have to say about meditation for now.

						   Creation vs Evolution   An interesting debate, some say it's not worth debating. It's pretty cut and dry (depending on what side your on). I am a evolutionist.&nbsp; What I don't understand is why can't it be both?   In college I dabbled a bit in the theory of Time.&nbsp; To make a long semester short, my teacher theorized that "time" was different in the past.&nbsp;   In the past the seconds were longer. It sounds easy enough to grasp, but it's implications result in a case for the creationists.   When religious scientists try and prove the creationism theory they are bombarded with 'The rocks are old', 'look at the fossil record', 'look at the transitionally fossils', 'Look at the age and size of the universe'.&nbsp; They started looking for ways to explain this, they joined the dots to find that "time" was different during the 7 days of creation.   Ok, Sounds a little hokey but there might be some valid points.&nbsp; According to the creationists God took 6 days to make the earth/universe and a day to rest right? (I am a little sketchy with these facts)&nbsp;&nbsp;If time was different back then, a second was much much longer, (a&nbsp;second back then could have been years in our current&nbsp;seconds). So a lot more could happen in a short amount of time.&nbsp;   The proof that "time" is slowing down is in the high precision clocks of today. There are two ways of telling time. The Dynamic clock, and the Atomic Clock. The Dynamic clock is how long it takes for the earth to go around the Sun.   The atomic clock is "Time based on the atomic second, i.e. on the unit defined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation from the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom undisturbed by external fields. Leap seconds may be introduced to keep atomic time within 0.9 seconds of Universal Time" as taken from  urlLink www.astron.nl/aips++/docs/glossary/a.html    With that being said, scientists have noticed that every year fractions of seconds have to be added to the atomic clock to keep it in time with the dynamic clock. Creationists see this as a slowing of time itself. The seconds are getting shorter as we progress to the future.&nbsp;   During biblical times&nbsp;people lived a lot (so they say) longer, Adam himself lived 930 years. If the&nbsp;"second" was longer&nbsp;back then in relation to dynamic&nbsp;time (they are independant) then Adam could have easily lived that long.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Does this mean that God created everything in his short time frame?&nbsp;Does this mean that evolution AND creation go hand in hand?     &nbsp;

						   I ve given up naming the chapters (for now) to restrictive.   I am going to talk a bit about religion and how I perceive it.   Religion is so constricting. It&nbsp;takes the fun out of everything. Why is it bad to swear, have sex and be naked?&nbsp; Do you really think God gives a rats ass?&nbsp;   The other day I was scolded at work for saying "Jesus!" (well I had said it a couple times). She considered it a swear and gave the impression that I should feel bad for saying it. I replied  "I know Jesus, and he doesn't mind."   This kind of thing annoys me. I don't consider "God damn it" a swear, I don't consider "Jesus Christ" a swear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize if I am offending you personally. But I am the one saying it. I am the one who deals with the "consequences".   I like God, I consider myself to be God, I consider You to be God.&nbsp;I don't find  God damn it &nbsp; a swear.&nbsp; I am the only one that matters.&nbsp;   I love this place that religious people have invented. "Hell" (another word I don't consider a swear).&nbsp; I am sure its not as bad as they say it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of all the anticipated&nbsp;bad events. 'I am going to get a tooth pulled' you build it up to be this horrible thing, but when your in the chair, it's not that bad.&nbsp; I think hell is much the same.&nbsp;It's built it up to be this terrible place but once your there you'd get use to it.&nbsp; (as long as it wasnt' humid, you can never get used to that)

						   God was driving the 174 Special tonight. I was lucky enough to take that bus home.&nbsp;It was on time for a change.&nbsp;He was young, maybe 27. &nbsp;   He was large and round and&nbsp;wore sunglasses. He&nbsp;said "Hello" and "Thank you" to every person getting on the bus. (Dead giveaway)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   I walked toward the back, then back up to the front. I wanted to be able to say&nbsp;"Thank you" when I got off. &nbsp; He&nbsp;wore sunglasses, and had a black goatee.&nbsp;His arms were covered in fire tattoos...Wait a second? Would God&nbsp;have a goatee and fire tattoos?&nbsp;Most likely (we all&nbsp;remember Ned&nbsp;Flanders as the Devil). &nbsp;   He was whistling "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Odd for July, but very cheery. &nbsp; At my stop God told me to "have a good night", &nbsp;to which I replied "Thanks". &nbsp; I wish I had have said the same back, maybe I'll see him tomorrow.

						   What is God going to do today?&nbsp; &nbsp;   God was woken up around 5:30 am. Two of her favorite beings were walking over her begging for attention. God got up, went to the bathroom and then&nbsp;back to bed. The kids ran downstairs thinking it was breakfast. ("not till 6:30" she says) &nbsp;   God couldn't sleep, her boyfriend kept harassing her. Poke Poke Poke,&nbsp;"what ya doing?", "where are the cats?" God was getting annoyed.   She got up and went to the bathroom and brushed her hair, and went back to bed. Poke Poke Poke, God threatened her boyfriend with eternal damnation. Her boyfriend laughed knowing that doesn't exist.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Six thirty, God gets up (for real this time). Boyfriend&nbsp;says "Come back to bed." So&nbsp;God does, 6:36, "I only have 24 minutes before my bus comes" exclaims God. The cats are furious. &nbsp;   Finally she gets up, gets dressed and goes downstairs. God's cats are in a panic. Breakfast is 4 minutes late. &nbsp;   God gets her lunch ready for work, Left over roasted red pepper pesto on&nbsp;whole wheat pasta&nbsp;with chicken (heavenly), a banana, and a yogurt. God's little sister is in the way, cooking a 3 course meal for breakfast (well one course but it had a lot of preparation).&nbsp;God grabs a bowl of cereal and sits down to watch some TV. &nbsp;   God's boyfriend stumbles downstairs. They sit together watching the news, making fun of the reporters. &nbsp;   It is now 6:57, 3 minutes till&nbsp;God has to leave.&nbsp;A&nbsp;quick brush of the teeth (as&nbsp;tastefully suggested by the boyfriend) and she's out the door. &nbsp;  &nbsp;I have no idea where&nbsp;God works,&nbsp;I do know that she gets off at 5, and usually has to stop at the store on her way home.

						   How better to start a Monday morning than with a religious debate?&nbsp; I started reading a book called “How We Believe; The Search for God.”&nbsp; And felt it was fitting. &nbsp;   My search started (unknown to me at the time) in 1st year college.&nbsp; I was introduced to a teacher that would change my path and open my mind. His favorite saying was “Think outside the box”. What does that mean? What box? &nbsp;  Back then I thought I was thinking outside the box, how wrong was I. &nbsp; My interest started with physics. How cool. I would devour all the literature I could find, I spent a lot of time trying to grasp the paper “ urlLink Atomic Constants in Light and Time ” I would draw light cones with little dots representing ZPE, trying to grasp what the author was saying. When I thought I knew, I realized I wasn’t even close. There was a period of about 10 minutes where it was crystal clear. I still haven’t been able to get it back. &nbsp;   After my war with Zero Point Energy, I moved on to wackier things. The Great Pyramids, Nazca Lines, Mayan Ruins, Atlantis, The Face on Mars, books by Graham Hancock, and&nbsp;Erik Von Daniken&nbsp;&nbsp;filled my head. It was some time before I realized that these books all had a similar theme: God. &nbsp;   Even the physicists that wrote about gravity and time, their ultimate goal was to prove there was a God. What was I getting myself into?

						   "God is a pattern, an explanation for our universe, our world and ourselves. God is the key actor in the story  'the greatest story ever told'  about where we came from, why we are here and where we are going. God is a myth, on of the most sublime and sacred myths ever constructed by the mythmaking animal. God is ultimate enforcer of rules, the final arbiter of moral dilemmas and the pinnacle object of commitment. People believe in God because we are pattern-seeking, story telling, mythmaking, religious, moral animals." - "How We Believe" Michael Shermer   We are pattern seeking animals, an example of this is seen here:      This is called a Kanizsa Square. It works by fooling the mind into thinking there is a square. Is God an illusion created by our brains false boundaries?   It really opened my perspective to why people believe in God.  Some questions that come to mind: A pattern seems logical, how else would God present itself?  Are there patterns to life? Or is it all a coincidence?  What's the difference between a coincidence and a pattern? If there was no one to see the patterns would they exist?  Do you exist only because someone else says so?  It is easy to tell if something is organic or not. Their is a certain recognizable feature that says  alive , does God exist only to the  alive  things? Does an amoeba care if their is a God or not?  Big questions, I have no answers.

      Up until you’re about 20 you get to chose who you spend your time with. In public school you have your best friends, group of people that you play with, have sleepovers with, they are your friends, they are of your choosing and you love them.  As you get older things start to change, you are put in classes with people you don’t know, you’re forced to make new friends and avoid enemies. But you still get to choose.  Once you start working (unless you work for yourself) you no longer get to choose who you hang out with. You are thrown in with a bunch of seemingly random people who share a small common thread which is the work place.  Libra’s mix it up with Cancers, Gemini’s with Leo’s, Aquarius’s with Virgos. It’s madness! For the first time you can’t pick your company.   Sometimes you get lucky. Me, a Virgo works with a Cancer and an Aquarius. I am not sure how we manage, but we have never had a workplace issue. Sometimes the stars are wrong.  The other problem with work is that if you do decide you don’t like someone there isn’t much you can do about it.&nbsp; You can suck it up, or quit. A lot of people suck it up, and suck it up and suck it up, until they are so full of hot air they explode. (I have only seen this happen a couple times.)&nbsp;   It’s a crazy beast. How was it 20 years ago?&nbsp; People found a job and stayed with it forever. There are people working in my office that have been here for 40+ years!&nbsp; Different mentality I guess.   I don’t hate my job, I like it enough. I like most of the people, I have a few friends I can kill and afternoon with, and it’s a strange animal. That’s what I know.

      Friday before the long weekend. Does it get any better?   I guess it could. Its 7:45am and I have a long day ahead of me.&nbsp; I should put an asphalt in the extractor before I start this, that will give me 15min of free time.   2.5 hours later   I got my asphalt in, and its still there. My boss is sick, so I am running the show.  I have only had one emergency today so far. Cross your fingers and knock on wood. I have 20 million things to do before lunch, well only four, but it feels like 20 million.   I think I am going to Cora's for lunch. A breakfast/lunch place with great fruit platters and crepes (sp?) The service is very slow so it should make for a good 2+hr lunch.   My proctors are simmering on the stove, and my hydrometers are swimming in there bath. Thank goodness its a long weekend.

      It's times like these where I miss my friends the most.   My boyfriend just called. He got in an accident at work. He's okay, but it could have been worse. I haven't seen him since Sunday. He's still 3 hours away.   I&nbsp;have one friend in this city, and she's great but I rely on her too much. My other close friends are in Toronto, Nunavut, Australia, and Prince Edward Island. I can't exactly walk over to visit.&nbsp;   My sister is home for the week, so no luck there. I guess I'll have to sit and wait...   I wish I could pick up the phone and chat, I use to talk on the phone a lot. I love talking on the phone, hours and hours. I wish I could walk down the hall and walk into a friends place, kick my feet up and rant about my day.&nbsp;   I have the cats to talk too, they are good listeners, not much for conversation though (unless its dinner time).   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Things I love about Home.   1. Berry season. The berries were at peak ripeness this weekend. My sister and I picked enough blackberries and raspberries to make 15 small tarts. mmmmmmmm  2. Dogs. They are so happy to see you, no matter how long you have been away.  3.&nbsp;Bugs. Their are no bugs in the city. I got about 50 000 bug bites, they rock.  4. The beach. Nothing better than lazing by the lake. Full sun with no one around.  5. Fishing. Even though my fishing rod mysteriously vanished I still managed to go fishing a couple times with my Dad and sisters. Dad caught a monster, I caught a minnow :-)  6. Rain. The rain sounds so much nicer at home. There are no cars or buses, just rain.  7. This week was the first time since Christmas that the whole family was together. Twice a year seems to be most we can manage.&nbsp;It was lots of fun.  8. Tubing. I have never been tubing. (at least not behind a fast boat) Two tubes at a time, 3 people total. So much fun. (My back and tricepts are paying for it though)  9. Swimming. I love swimming. It was the first time this year I have been in.  10. Food Network. I love that channel. I don't get it&nbsp;in Ottawa.

      What started out to be a great day has quickly changed. I have had my first “Reamed Out” experience.  I guess one of the techs doesn’t like the new set up. And instead of telling me like an adult, he decided to yell and embarrass me and my lab partner.   It was quite the scene, he was so mad. What for? We didn’t affect him at all in the re-arrangement of the tech space. We optimized the space so it appears larger than it is. In his mind we “have more room than we deserve”.&nbsp;  I am pissed, really pissed. I could rant on and on about this but that won’t get me anywhere.   I am pissed.  …asshole.

      Yesterday around 4:00 my boss and I decide we need to re arrange our space.   We share a large room with 10 other technicians. (Field 10, Lab 3) We started planning how we could re arrange our space, with in 10 minutes we were scouring the office for extra furniture.   We brought our other lab person into the picture and started re arranging.&nbsp; We got rid of two large tables moved some walls (fake grey cube walls) made some make shift walls out of book cases and viola!&nbsp;at 4:50 we had a totally different space.   Our new space is much better, "the lab" now has its own space. My computer is now blocked from the rest of the office, and my lab partner sits in my much larger cube.   I did some cleaning. Lysoled my desk (lemon fresh) and got rid of some but not all of the clutter.

      Well I screwed up. Stupid asphalt. There goes another hour and another sample.&nbsp; Why am I the only one who can run this stuff??? This is very annoying.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  13:33&nbsp; I went for the fries. They weren't that good. But I am full now, I should be set for the day. I went for two short walks. It started to rain, which is good because its about 100% humidity outside.&nbsp; Still running asphalt, one more to go.   12:40&nbsp; I am resisting the chipwagon...Should I go? Should I not? Its a dilemma. I love fries. I had a sandwich and a yoghurt for lunch... Their is no way that will last me until 6:00...  Should I go for the fries? I'll ask someone to walk with me. That way I get exercise. Yeah exercise is good....so are fries.   &nbsp;  10:42&nbsp; Still running asphalt. I received 3 rush asphalts this morning, so everything gets pushed back. I am taking next Monday Tuesday and Wednesday off!!! I am excited. I am going home and&nbsp;I am gonna swim, and&nbsp;it's going to be sweet.&nbsp; So no Blogs till the end of next week. (My parents have dial up on a windows 95 computer)&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   So I came into work early today.&nbsp; Rolled in around 7:10.   (There is a&nbsp; guy staring at me...Through my window... Does he want me? Should I go out and see what his problem is?&nbsp; There he goes. Wait, &nbsp;still staring, Just moved his truck a little...Does he think I am going with him today?&nbsp; Ok, he stopped. That was weird.)   Today I'll be running asphalt, again.&nbsp; I don't' mind it so much anymore. I like having a job I can be focused on. As long as I have no other distractions.   I watched "The Simple Life" last night, I have to say I love that show. I don't care how rich they are or how snobby and out of touch, its funny. Nicole reminds me of my middle sister. Bad mouth, inappropriate questions, playing guys, but sweet as pie.   This is a pretty disjointed post. I have time to kill between asphalt readings so&nbsp;I may add to it as the day progresses.   I had a dream about a water park. I have had dreams like it before. There was a very large slide (or rollercoaster) and if you went on it you got a free ride. I remember going and not being able to get my free ride.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      That Seinfeld was on tonight. The one where Elaine finds out that her boyfriend Putty is religious. Too funny.   So it turns out that it wasn't  urlLink God driving the bus . It was a guy named Jay.  He was early, outside the bus smoking. He started talking to me. His first question was if I worked at the mall. That's how our conversation started.  He was impressed with my job. I always have a hard time describing what I do to people not in the field. The speel usually sounds like this   "I work for an engineering company; in the lab. I test concrete, asphalt, soils and aggregates".  They (Jay) will ask "how do you test them? Like strength?" ect ect.   He asked to see my pinky ring. That will start the conversation.   I sat up front to continue the conversation. I found out that he has worked as a bus driver for 2 years. He told me about his problems associated with the City taking over the transit system.   He told me a sad story about one of his colleagues died on the job.   Under the old policy OC&nbsp;Transpo would&nbsp;donate a bus to take operators to the funeral. Now that the City&nbsp;has taken over, &nbsp;it was no longer&nbsp;cost effective and scrapped the program. A private bus company&nbsp;donated a bus and a driver to the cause. The Head of OC Transpo put a stop to that, telling the donated bus driver to;   "Get off my property, or I'll charge you with trespassing."&nbsp;   "And they wonder why moral is low" Jay explained.   I was shocked, but not really surprised. After talking to the police officer I am starting to realize that the City of Ottawa is going to hell.   It will only feel like an eternity...   &nbsp;     &nbsp;

      There is something magical about the morning. If I could crawl out of bed earlier I would.  I got up this morning, after a very restful sleep. Muffin didn't even wake me up on his way to work (except for a quick kiss).&nbsp;   When I got outside it was very foggy. Fog always reminds me of the short story by Stephen King called "The Mist". In the story there is a violent thunder storm (..We had a storm last night) and there is a hole ripped in space/time. Monsters come through the hole and start killing everyone. Luckily I haven't seen any monsters yet.   I walk down my lane and I noticed two women having a conversation. They weren't making a sound. It was beautiful.&nbsp; They were using sign language. I thought to myself "everyone should have to use sign language in the morning" subconsciously I started acting out the letters of the alphabet in sign (I forget how to do  q h p x) . &nbsp;It was so peaceful and quiet.&nbsp;   I made my way to the road, the Sun was trying hard to burn through the fog. You could see a perfect circle. I wish I had my camera.   I walked uneventfully to my bus stop. Two girls imitating crows were the only entertainment.&nbsp; I sat and read my book till the bus came. When I got to work the Sun had won. Magic gone, its time to start my day.

      I grew up in the country. Every weekend my sisters and I would go to my grandparents and play on there farm. They lived on 50 acres of land, which had a stream, forest and a small orchard.  When I was in grade 6 we moved into my grandparents house, and the weekends became an every day experience. I miss the country.   I have lived in Ottawa for almost 3 years now. It's a beautiful city with lots of greenspace. But it's still a city. I live in a townhouse next to a very busy street, which is also part of the transitway. It is very noisy.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Every weekend I try to get out of the city, It usually consists of a drive.  I can't say we drive much in the winter, but in the summer we go for a long drive in the country at least once a week.  &nbsp;  Today we left at 10:00, (late start) We drove through Carp, a small cute town outside of Kanata. Made our way up to Arnprior, looking at the houses, scenery, wildlife (2 fawns, 100's gophers, x amount of road kill)Crossed the bridge to Quebec, stopped for groceries&nbsp;and made our way home.&nbsp;A quick 5 hour trip.&nbsp; I love driving in the country. I love driving (even though I seldom, if ever get behind the wheel).&nbsp; It's a great place where you can rant about the weeks troubles, make fantastic plans about the future, still learning about the person next to you.&nbsp;

      Today is Saturday, and I have work to do.  &nbsp;  I started my petrographic analysis a half hour ago. You can only sit doing one of those for at the most 45min at a time. For those who don't know what it is,&nbsp;take about 1 kg of stone, think driveway material. Now analyze each stone, and place it into one of 80 categories. Welcome to my Saturday.  &nbsp;  I have only done 2 of these before, I haven't quite found my niche. I look at each rock a couple times, placing it in different baggies with the assigned number. If one bag has too many stones I think I must be doing it wrong, and re examine the bag. Each stone has to be scratched, and doused in HCL (hydrochloric acid). If it fizzes then half of the categories are gone.  &nbsp;  Once my hands start feeling smooth and kinda itchy I know it's time for a break, the HCL is eating my fingers. This stuff is better than Palmolive!  &nbsp;  So the other times I have done a petrographic analysis was last week, and in third year college. I remember the lab very&nbsp;well as one of the funniest events of 3rd&nbsp; year geology.&nbsp; &nbsp;  I was sitting with my friend, we'll call him "Stupid". Stupid and I are goofing off, bitching about how stupid Petrograpics are, he for some reason punches the drywalled column that's by our table. I laugh at Stupid, he's bleeding from his knuckles.  Stupid,&nbsp;asks "Dare me to put HCL in my cut?",  I think I replied with  "I'll give you a quarter".&nbsp;  So he takes the bottle and douses his cut with acid.  Stupid yells "YEEEOOOWWWWWW!!!" At the top of his lungs. Meanwhile I am losing a lung laughing. He shoves his acid knuckle in his&nbsp; mouth and goes to find a teacher.&nbsp; He comes back a while later, after finding a teacher he says that the HCL won't hurt him and is considers a good disinfectant. I think I'll stick to polysporin.  &nbsp;

      I have stuff in my head that's&nbsp;needs to get out, but I just can't do it.&nbsp; I have only been blogging for a couple weeks, and I enjoy the chance to share my life. But where do you draw the line? I tend to be an open book, but do people want to read about my extreme personal life? Of course you do.&nbsp;Do I want to write it?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I guess I have to think, is this about ratings? Or is it about joining a global community regardless of the content.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I am&nbsp; frustrated, I wish I could open up. I guess it will take time.  &nbsp;  I have been having a recurring dream, I've had it 3 times. All with the same theme, but different variations.&nbsp; Last night I was sure I'd have the dream again. Instead I had another.  &nbsp;   "I was looking out my window,&nbsp;There was a large mound of dirt covered with grass.&nbsp;On&nbsp;top sat a wolf and a large cat. They were sharing the den, they both had babies. I called to my boyfriend to come see, but he was sleeping and refused to wake up."   &nbsp;  With my dream book on my lap I am trying to figure out what this dream means.  &nbsp;  Wolf- A powerful sign of your relationship with your personal family and sense of family.  Cat- Represents your deep intuitive self. Relates to feelings of independence and power. Represent the feminine essence.  &nbsp;  I guess dreams&nbsp;are&nbsp;a way of releasing.&nbsp;If I don't get to talk about what I am feeling, I will dream. Dreams often help&nbsp;me deal with problems or situations, I find with interpreting my dreams I find out what the real problem is, and its often not what I was fretting over the day before.   &nbsp;

      So I am convinced Ottawa is in the middle of a crime spree, or maybe I am just being affected by an ongoing spree.  &nbsp;  Last week I wrote about a jewerlly store robbery that involved guns and the escape of two thieves. This week downtown 3 people were shot, (luckily no one was killed) The bank by my friends house was robbed at knife point, and he got away on his peddle bike.  &nbsp;  This morning I come to work to see a police officer. Someone had busted the window beside mine (I mentioned it in yesterday's blog). And stole my boss's computer.  &nbsp;  Stupid bandits (that's the name my friend and I gave them). They broke the window and stole the computer right off her desk, spraying glass over everything. I guess the bars on our windows aren't small enough to&nbsp; stop the bandits from grabbing the new slimmer dell's we just got.  &nbsp;  Anyway&nbsp; another quick note, The cop also took the cell phone I found last week, he couldn't figure it out either.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      What’s on my desk…  There are two types of office people, those with messy desks, and those with clean organized desks. I am messy.  I love clutter, I pretend to like organization but I always resort to chaos.  On my desk as we speak are a number of useless things.  1- A plant given to me on my birthday last year, it’s very over grown taking over about 1/5 of my total desk space. Hiding in the plant is a happy meal Barbie wearing a purple outfit, a shell, a rock and a feather.  Window sill- I am very lucky to have a window to look out. I face the window, which means my back is to the office, and any nosy parker can watch what I am doing on the computer. (Did I mention I don’t have walls or a door) There is a jar of clay and water that sparkles when you shake it, a “This sink is for HANDWASHING ONLY” sign, stolen from somewhere. And another jar of rocks. 2- A vase with water and a clipping from my plant. I don’t like killing things, even plants. A piece of my plant broke off, so I put it in a vase which takes up some more room on my desk. 3- My pen organizer. This has no pens in it. I see an eraser that looks like a pen and I keep grabbing it only to find that it’s full of rubber and not ink. Two highlighters, two mechanical pencils with no lead, a stash of pennies (that the pop machine will not take) and a stack of business cards. 4- Next is my monitor, an old school 14” beauty. It sits atop a wood plastic thing which allows me to store junk underneath it. Under my monitor is a stamp with my work address on it. A stamp pad, some rocks, more business cards, and a foot to meter conversion sheet. 5- My phone is to the right. It’s brand new, given to me after 1.5 years of bitching. It’s white. Shortly after the office switched to black phones. 6- My mouse pad I have two mouse pads, one on top of another. Solinst “high quality groundwater & surface water instruments” covers my old stick to the desk type. 7- My mouse and keyboard are black, which would have matched my phone if I had of gotten a new one.  They sit in front of me. 8- In front of my keyboard is a paper holder upper thing, always full of reports to be fixed or written.  9- To the left is my inbox. Full of crap that I will never get too. 10- My file holder, full of crap. Mostly filing.   I have a very small desk, the kind they made before computers were invented. The keyboard is at the wrong height. The drawers are empty. (Except for the one I keep snacks in) But I like it, clutter and all.

      I started reading a book last night, it's called "Oryx and Crake", it takes place in the future seemingly after some sort of bio-war. The main character, Snowman is alone, surrounded by genetically modified people. He lives in the forest, naked except for a sheet.   Children come to talk to him. He mostly shoos them away, annoyed with their questions.  The children have no idea about the past, they don't understand the concept of computers, or hamburgers, or even reading. Snowman is alone with no one to understand him.   The Snowman is almost God-like. He lived in the past, and is all knowing to the children. He knows he isn't God, he knows that all the information in his head will be lost.   It makes me think about if I was alone. Surrounded by familiar looking people, but was so far detatched  it was impossible to become close.  Would I try to change my appearance so I could fit in? Would I try and educate the children? Would I keep a paper blog, only to realize that no one would ever be able to read it? What would the point of living be if there was not one around to validate you? The book raises questions about the meaning of life.  Everyone is alone, regardless of how many people same or otherwise surround you.  Not to sound too morbid, being alone isn't a bad thing, In fact, it's a great thing. I enjoy being alone sometimes. Other times I hate it. Sometimes I starve for social contact, while other times I run and hide. I don't think you  appreciate being with someone if you were never alone.  The more I learn the more I see the need for balance. Not just in being alone, but with everything. Embracing the bad things in life is difficult, but necessary. It's hard to see the perfection sometimes, but it's there.   I devoured 150 pages last night, and wanted to stay home today so I could finish it. I guess I should eat my words and get back to work.

      Every so often on my walk home from work I see a ninja.  Strange as this may sound, its true.   The first time I saw him, it was spring. He was fighting another guy and a girl was video taping. They were doing choreographed moves, throws, kicks, punches. It was all very impressive.   Other times I've seen him he's alone, except for his black pug dog tied to a near by tree. By himself he jumps, chops and kicks. He looks like he could be in a Kill Bill fight scene.    Sometimes he has nunchucks (how ever you spell it), or a staff, or two short sticks that he twirls around. I try not to stare as I walk by, but he's the only ninja I have ever seen in person.  I am tempted to just sit and watch, I wish I could see from my window. It looks so disciplined and sharp, yet smooth and familiar.  It would be fun to try, I wonder if I'd make a good ninja...

      When it comes to supper I am a bit of a freak.   Sometimes I'll start thinking about supper soon after lunch. I'll talk to friends at work, ask them what they are having, in hopes of hearing something great to prepare. If I don't hear anything I'll go online and search for recipes, or interesting ingredients.  I love food, I love talking about it, cooking it, eating it, shopping for it. I enjoy the whole process.  I remember a great conversation I had with my middle sister, it was about the mandarin buffet. mmmm prime rib.  At Christmas my Mom has a list. Its not a list of presents. Its a list of food. hor'dourves, side dishes and desserts. We spend hours pouring over cook books, bookmarking the pages, reading and re-reading.   So tonight I had forgot about supper. Not thinking about it at all until I got home and my sister asked "What's for supper". I had no idea. I had a shower and decided to experiment. It started with "macaroni surprise", and ended up being a "tex-mex macaroni and cheese yumtastic stir-fry". I've out done myself.

      Last night I went the  movies. I am sure everyone has at least heard about the guy who went on the all McDonald's diet for 1 month. Well he made a documentary about it.  It was a great movie.  urlLink Morgan Spurlock  the director, did an excellent job turning me off McDonald's and sugary sodas. (I left my half finished bottle of coke at the theater)  The rules to his month long Mac Attack were simple, 3 square meals a day, all from McDonald's, (even the water)  had to eat everything on the menu at least once, and when asked to SuperSize it he had to take it.  Also he had to limit his walking to 5000 steps a day (the typical amount of walking the average American does).  The movie was filled with fast food facts, some of them are posted on his website.  urlLink click here.   One that didn't make the cut is McD's new Chicken Salad. It contains 51 grams of fat and more calories than a Big Mac. (for all you ladies that's 85% of your daily recommended amount in one "healthy" salad)  Aside from the disturbing facts, watching this person over the month was hard. His skin got very mealy and almost green, he woke up with heart problems. His moods mimicked that of an addict, They showed him depressed, then  going through the McD's drive through and getting high as he ate the food.   The documentary was inspired by the two American girls who sued McD's for making them fat. They didn't win. McDonald's make some great points in there case though. "McDonald's: "Any processing our foods undergo make them more dangerous than unprocessed foods" So that makes everything on the menu...  Some people may say that the documentary is stupid. Everyone knows not to eat fast food every day. By day 21 his liver was in such bad shape every doctor told him to get off the diet. His liver had turned to fat, if he started to experience any symptoms to get to emergency immediately.   I don't' know about you, but poison is poison, whether you take it all at once or over a lifetime.   My friend and I went to see the movie at a small theater in the World Exchange Plaza downtown. It was on the third floor. When we walked out of the movie directly in front was an escalator. We both saw it and said in unison "Let's take the stairs."

      This is an interesting question.  How to be happy.   Like previous blogs, I am bringing my boyfriend into this. He's a great example.  Me, I am relatively happy. I enjoy my job enough, I like the people I work with. I have no real family issues, I have a great relationship with my boyfriend, I have great friends that would bend over backwards for me, and me for them. All in all I have a pretty good life. But what does it take to be happy?  For the past two years my boyfriend has worked as a driller. A job he prizes, and brags about. The only problem is...He's not happy. Everyday he would come home and complain about how much he hates his boss, hates his co workers, hates being yelled at, hates fixing the "piece of shit rigs". And that aside he was physically exhausted, knees, back, arms, head, feet. Everything hurt all the time. He would work insane hours, often by himself doing the job of two or three people.  The only bonus to this was he made a shit load of money. His boss would throw money at him to keep him working, bought him a new company truck, new everything all the time.   But unfortunately money doesn't buy happiness.   My boyfriend tried, he bought computers and magazines, and more computers trying hide his misery in the newest video card, or scsi component. Eventually it had to end.  June 25, 2004 marked the end to his misery. He quit his job. I thought he would be happy. But he was not. He was scared, and worried, and nervous.   We went on vacation, trading in his new company truck for a rental car. When we got back we had no truck. Luckily his dad lent him his truck for the time being.   He started his new job this past Tuesday. When I got home from work he was eager to tell me about his day. It was the first time in months I saw him after work.  What's amusing about this story is that my boyfriend now works for a toxic waste removal company. He drives vacuum trucks sucking what ever sludge needs to be sucked. From TCE to human waste. All this at a greatly reduced salary.  I haven't seen him this happy in a long time,  I almost forgot what it was like. He's still worried about money. Who isn't? I just keep telling him that he's happy now, and money doesn't matter.

      I remember a specific Saturday a few years ago, I was around 16 or 17. I was watching cartoons with my sisters and my Dad walks in and sits down. We were watching Bugs Bunny.   My dad starts talking with the characters, and saying everything that was going to happen. Everything to the last detail he knew. I was shocked, "how do you know what's going to happen???" my dad replied "I used to watch this when I was a kid".   Ok that's fine, I watched bugs bunny when I was little, and I still do. But I couldn't' repeat the dialogue or say whether it was an anvil or a piano that was dropped. Or any other cartoons I watched when I was little, I can't even remember the titles.  So why could my Dad after 30 years remember?  Thinking about this I realized that their are cartoons that I can talk with the characters and say what's going to happen next. And I think we all know what it is. The Simpsons.  Are the Simpsons the bugs bunny of our generation? I have watched A LOT of Simpsons episodes. It was the only show I watched faithfully, and still is to some degree. (recently my 6:00 spot has been replaced with spongebob) I know all the punch lines, and still laugh at them. One that comes to mind...   Homer pretending to be Mr. Burns:  "Hello, My name is Mr Burns, I believe you have                                      a letter for me."  Post office worker:  "Ok Mr Burns, What's your first name?"  Homer replies:       "I don't know..."  It kills me, their are so many priceless Simpson quotes.   Sponge Bob Square Pants is the newest show, I don't know if it will have the lasting power that the Simpsons has, but it is still funny. A scene that comes to mind.   Spongebob intimidating Squidward:  "Everyone's and idiot but me."   Funny how both of my examples involve impersonation. I wonder what that means...  Anyway, this isn't going anywhere anymore. Cartoons are great. Do you have a favorite Simpsons quote?   one more Spongebob.  Patrick and Spongebob find a baby scallop. Spongebob: "Oh look Patrick its a baby scallop, it can't even fly yet" Patrick: " Why can't it fly? Is it stupid?" Spongebob: "No Patrick, its not stupid, its a baby."

      Yesterday I was looking at different cell phones online. Telus, Rogers, Bell, Fido, they are all confusing. Week day minutes, weekend minutes, pay as you go minutes, monthly minutes. I just want a cell phone that is cheap and will work all the time.  I don't' care about games, ring tones, or colour screens (but surfing the net would be cool, I think that costs extra).   I want a phone that can call some numbers for free. Like my boyfriend and I each have a phone and we can call each other for free. Does that exist? Or have free text messenging.  I don't really like cell phones, I think because I am scared of radiation. (colour screens VERY bad) But why should I worry? I work AND live under high tension power lines. Anyway off topic.   So my sister and I are out for a walk tonight, there is a nice subdivision down the road and across the train tracks, we like to look at the houses and make fun of the perfectly manicured lawns that have a certain cult feel to them.   Anyway on our way home my sis finds a cell phone, she turns it on and it works. Unfortunately its all in Japanese, we struggle with it like the chimps in "2001 a Space Odyssey" manage to destroy the cover (oops) take out the battery thinking that will reset the language setting. Only to discover we don't know how to turn it back on. What year is this? And I can't turn on a cell phone? I am pretty embarrassed but I manage to turn it back on (who knew the "no" button really means "on" ) And I call home. No answer. I scroll through the list of names in this person's speed dial. Most of them are Japanese. I don't really want to call these random people asking if they know someone who lost a cell phone. Maybe I'll wait for someone to call me...

      I came across this article a few weeks ago. It has stuck with me ever since. I have read quite a few articles on the possibility of giants once walking the earth, and at first I thought it was a scam.  Now I am not so sure, the eye witness accounts of finding  grave sites with super human sized skeletons is interesting. There is a place in the States that was taken over by the government/military after a group of archeologist found skeletons of giants, they had 6 digits and two rows of teeth.   This picture could easily be a fake, but the point of view is real, they are open to the possiblity that giants once walked the earth, because it says so in their bible. If the same thing were to happen in the US or Canada, I am sure science would step up and say it was a freak accident. Then forget about it and eventually say it never existed.  See article at following link.  urlLink  GIANT HUMAN SKELETON ,

      How many people drive to work every day? How many people use roads? I can't think of one person in Canada who doesn't use roads in some way or another. I have spent my summer thus far under a fume hood making sure the roads are good. At first I thought it was ironic that me, not owning a car makes a living at making sure  drivers get to work safely. But then I realized that I take the bus.  A lot of work goes into making a road, my part which consists of testing asphalt and concrete making sure it meets specification is a whole industry. Not to mention the quarries the contractors subcontractors, the readymix companies, the engineers, the technicians (that's me!), the inspectors, quality control, and safety. Its a HUGE process to lay a strip of asphalt.   My knowledge is limited to the testing of materials, including asphalt, and for the past 4 weeks that is what I have been doing at work. Asphalt, and more Asphalt. Split, run, wash, sieve, repeat.  So the next time your on a road. Think about me working in front of hot asphalt ovens, deadly TCE, and annoying buzzers, and thank the hard working contractors who spend all day in the hot sun laying down the roads you drive on.   Ps- I am not responsible for potholes, or traffic jams resulting from construction.  :-)

      My good friend Holly called me from Melbourne last night, it was sooo good to hear from her. It's funny how things happen. Like the night before I got in touch with my friend Chris after mentioning that I wanted to talk to him. There he appeared on MSN after 3 months of not hearing from him. He asked about Holly, and I said that I hadn't talked to her in a couple months.  I had a dream last night about flying, I was going on vacation with Dave and we were at the airport. He was getting lost (the only way to describe it) and I was trying to hold the plane for him. I remember paying a lot for the trip and jumping on the plane at the last minute without him. Needless to say I was stressed. But Dave comes up the stairs and jumps onto the plane as it takes off. I wasn't sitting with Dave on the plane, I was sitting with an old high school friend. Someone I haven't talked to in years. Maybe I should call her? I remember there was no front on the plane and we were in the front row. Just open air. I put my seatbelt on trying to not fall out of the plane. I was thinking to myself "this isn't very safe" the plane was flying down a river only feet off of the top of the water, I heard something about getting to the ocean, then we were flying through this strange town, run-down with a lot of churches. All of a sudden we were going up up up, over the ocean. Then I woke up.  It loosely connects with talking to old friends, but it was a neat dream so I thought I'd share.

      Today my boyfriend shaved his beard. It doesn't sound like a major occurrence, but  I haven't seen him without a full beard in over 4 years. I remember when he stopped shaving, December 31, 1999.  When he came downstairs I could tell he didn't like it, and wished he hadn't done it. (although he had too for his new job) I tried to be supportive, telling him that it looked "different in a good way" it was pretty transparent.   On the inside I was shocked, utterly shocked, I couldn't believe the person sitting beside me.  He was a stranger, a stranger watching TV in my house on my couch. I couldn't stop staring, I felt foolish because I have been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years, but he looked so different it was hard to accept.   He looked the way he did back when I was in Grade 12, and I realized that in all this time he hasn't changed. He is still the same 18 year old I fell in love with. And even though I really like the full beard, (and like my friend once said, his head is 2/3 covered with hair!) I think I will be able to get use to the new baby face.

      It was raining when we left the theater, walking in silence my boyfriend muttered, "we're screwed", "If half of that is true, we are screwed".   I learned a lot from the documentary. I can't say I followed the "war on terror" very closely, losing interest after they pulled out of Afghanistan.   I can remember exactly where I was when the towers were hit. I think everyone can. Sitting in class, a lab it think. Towards the end a teacher walks in and says "One of the World Trade Center towers was hit by an airplane." No one really thinks much of it, the word "terrorism" floats around and I immediately dismiss it. "Their is no way a terrorist flew a plane into the world trade center" I thought to myself.   Then I started watching the TV's set up in the cafeteria, I started seeing the people jumping out of the burning building. Then the second plane hit, right out of nowhere. I remember being glued to the TV, I remember seeing the towers fall, I remember the hole in the pentagon. I remember thinking that this is not a movie.   I enjoyed "Bowling for Columbine", and Fahrenheit 9/11 was excellent (but very sad). Michael Moore, did a great job. I'd say there are two sides to every story, in this case there is the Bush side, and the Moore side. Both people don’t' want to admit the other exists. Moore raises great points, he shows the sad side of war, he gives a voice to the little guy. It just happens to make a great movie. I am sure Bush has reasons besides "oil" for invading Iraq, but they don’t' make good movies. The movie basically follows Bushes life from before he was in office, the joke of an election, then how he handled 9/11. He connects the dots. That’s the best way to describe the film.  I would say that Moore is selective in the facts he shows, and I don’t blame him, He wants to make a point, and he wants it to have a dramatic affect. I'd like to hear what you think after you see it.   The documentary was not a movie either, they are all real people, real families, and real bombs. People are still being affected by the 911 attack. Save us Allah.

      I am not sure what this "Blog" thing is all about, but I am going to give it a shot.  So what is the first blog posting suppose to say? Who am I? Where I live?   Right now I am living in Ottawa, its about 30oC in the shade today and our air conditioner is sitting in the basement, brand new in the box. Its been there for one year today. My boyfriend claims that he hasn't installed it yet because we don't own a VCR, (the instructions are on vhs tape). He can rebuild drilling rigs and has about 10 computers (which he built from scratch) in the basement.  BUT can't lift an air conditioner into a window.  But to his defense he just spent a week driving me to the ocean where it was cool and breezy. Ottawa needs an ocean.

      I enjoy the simple things.  Today is a typical Sunday. Quick trip to the grocery store, caught the end of one movie and the beginning of another, quick nap, and laundry. Now it's 5:50 and almost time for supper.  I am sipping on a glass of chilled white wine, "Alianca Vinho Verde" Product of Portugal. In the last of my wine glasses. I have broken all but one of the set I was given for christmas.  I was turned onto this wine after receiving a bottle from a friend. I haven't had a daily glass since April or May. Wine is more of a cold weather thing for me.  With fall fast approaching I am excited, 1-I get to drink wine again and 2- I start working out. Two great things. I am getting the itch to get back to the gym. Not quite yet though a few more weeks and I'll be back at it for the fall/winter/spring (I have a wedding dress to fit into :-)  Yesterday I filled a vase with a perfect sunflower (picked from my garden) and a bunch of grass. Killer was very excited and proceeded to eat most of the grass in one sitting. Bender followed closely after, chewing on the sunflower leaves. It is still on my table today, a few mowed stalks of grass and the sunflower still as it looked outside.  At the grocery store I bought a few things I don't normally buy; blueberries, and cake mix. When I was growing up my Nanny would make this delicious dessert with blueberries and pineapple. It's so easy and so good.  Take a white cake mix (single cake if you can find it, other wise use half of a regular box) mix the cake mix. Melt half a cup of butter (or less if you prefer) mix the cake mix with the butter (ignore any baking instructions on the box) Take a pint of blueberries and a small can of crushed pineapple. Mix the blueberries and the pineapple (juice and all) in the bottom of a 8x8 pan. Take batter and spread over fruit mixture (you may need to use your hands and place flattened pieces of dough on the top of the fruit don't worry if there are gaps) Cook in 350oF oven until golden brown and bubbly. Cool and serve.  I cooked this earlier, It's cooling on the stove now.  BBQ hamburgers are for supper, with corn on the cob. I husked the corn, leaving the corn hairs all over the floor. I should have gone outside.  D$ is downstairs playing guitar, He's on BBQ duty, might be awhile before supper. At least I have half a glass of wine left.

      I watched the opening ceremonies last night, and I was impressed.  I don't watch sports. When I was a teenager and stuck at home on a Saturday afternoon I'd watch horse jumping, I don't remember loving it, but I would watch it for hours and hours.  The Olympics is kind of the same thing, I am here, Saturday afternoon, Beautiful outside, and I am watching synchronized diving. Why? I have no idea. There is something about the Olympics that I am drawn to. The excitement of the announcers, the determination of the athletes. It's all very exciting.  Last night I was waiting for my partner to get home. When he got home the first thing he said was "Your going to be hearing a lot of this in the next two week 'is there anything else on'?" I replied "no".  It's getting late, I've been watching the Olympics almost all day. I just saw a women lift over twice her body wieght over her head winning the gold. Yikes, 105lb women lifted 250+ lbs. Incredible.   I wish everyone the best of luck in this Olympic games.  Go Canada!

      I am not sure what the day will bring.  It’s raining, cold, and Friday the 13th. So far it’s been a good day. I got to work early.  I put in Dark Side, mellow out to the soothing sound of Pink Floyd before everyone shows up.  I love Pink Floyd, who doesn’t? “The Wall” went 23x platinum, and “Dark Side of the Moon” stayed on the billboard charts for 741 consecutive weeks.  I can listen to Dark Side anytime of day, and sing along to every song (except The Great Gig in the Sky). Back in the day when I drove to work I would blast “The Division Bell” and get through 4 or 5 songs.  I wish I could sing as well as I dance. Then I’d be a double threat. I sing anyway (how does that quote go “sing as if no one is listening”)  “The time has come, the song is over, thought I’d have something more to say.”

      I have a whole team of guardian angels looking out for me. I have a horseshoe up my ass. I have 9 lives. I am knocking on wood.  Yes it's the day before Friday the thirteenth, and I think I used all my good luck up.  My fiance picked me up from work, he wanted to go straight home. I wanted to go to the drug store. He reluctantly accepted.  As we pull into the parking lot a tie rod breaks on the truck. No tie rod=no steering, no steering=crash and burn. The drugstore is next to Canadian Tire  We are able to pull into the Canadian Tire (even with no steering) and within the hour they are fixing it.  This might have been a very different blog if we had have drove straight home.  Thank You God!!!

      If you can get away from the city lights you may see the Perseids in the evening of August 11, or the early morning of August 12th.  Local news channels may have a piece on the meteor shower. Explaining how the earth travels through a field of small particles resulting in a shower of meteors. Every year they predict thousands of meteors an hour. When in reality it’s more like 50.  I have two experiences with the Perseids.  The first one was during the summer between second and third year college. My boyfriend and I went to Parry Sound to visit a friend for the weekend. His cottage was in the boonies, down this rickety dirt road. I thought for sure I’d hear banjo’s at any minute. We found the place, it was beautiful right on the water. The next night we sat out on the dock, with blankets and watched the stars. The sky was huge with millions of stars. The Perseids we small that year, but the shooting stars we did see were spectacular streaking across the entire sky.  My second experience was in Toronto. Visiting friends we made a point to get up really early and watch the meteor shower from the park. The four of us woke up around 3:00 am. We noticed that it was very very foggy. Not discouraged by this we pile in the car and start driving north. We drove for what felt like an hour with no lifting of the fog. We pull of onto a side road to turn around. I remember looking up and seeing clear sky. We exit the car and start looking at the sky. We start seeing shooting stars everywhere. We start counting. It was cold and foggy but we counted 250 shooting stars or a number close to that ;-) Once the novelty of seeing shooting stars wore off we headed back toward Toronto and back to bed.  I doubt I’ll have as memorable of an experience this year, But every August 11th I think of those times.

      How bazaar is rain? Your walking along, and all of a sudden water starts falling from the sky.  A half naked muscle man walks by my window with a trowel and green plastic gloves (looks like a skinny Benicio del Toro), he doesn’t mind the rain, of course he’s not wearing many clothes. An engineer sprints to his car, he really minds the rain, doesn’t want to get his perfect hair wet.  It’s dark outside, really dark. Rain is falling hard splashing on the parking lot. Rivers form draining into the storm sewer, everything stops for the rain.  Now naked man is running, but the rain has slowed…I wonder what makes naked people run?  Most people in the office don’t know it’s raining, a good storm will draw a few people to the lab for a look. We have a large garage door that’s excellent for storm watching.  I went out to the garage to check out the storm, a veteran tech has his dog with him. A cute white dog with short hair, we stand and talk about the weather. A large crash of thunder shakes the building, car alarms go off in the distance.  It’s still raining a half hour later, heavy downpour. There will be floods on the news tonight.

      A new task at work is counting zebra mussels in a microscope. (I’ve touched on it in earlier blogs)  This is a surprisingly fun job. Time flies as you count the microscopic phytoplankton.  The creatures are so small and prehistoric looking. Some have pointed claws like scorpions; some have tails like lobster with long antennas, others are rounded covered with hair.  Most of them are clear, with a dark strip for the spine. Maybe it’s the formalin, or maybe they are clear for a reason.  The zebra mussels have tiny clear shells; they look like baby clams, sort of cute in a “destroying the ecosystem” type of way. They float in among the larger bugs (I call them bugs, I am sure they are fish or shell fish?) looking for something to attach to. The little zebra mussels are called villagers. A cute name also.  The animals in my Petri dish are so tiny. They have no idea what’s outside their little world. They swim around in an endless sea of fresh water, eating what ever they find, being eaten by an endless supply of predators.  I feel like I am sitting in my own Petri dish studying someone else’s Petri dish.   Wasn’t that a Simpson’s episode?

      I didn't think getting another roommate through before I told my sister to look for one.  The extra cash that my sister generates is very helpful, and since we have an extra room my fiance and I decided it would be a good idea to get one.  Not two weeks later my sister says she found a person who could stay for 4 months.  She is coming next weekend to look at the room...This morning I look at the room for the first time with "I have to move all this shit" eyes.  The room is FULL. There is a huge desk (full) of stuff. There are 4 bookcases full of books, there is a closet FULL of outdated computer stuff, guitars, rocks, and other stuff. There are boxes of knitting supplies, kitchen supplies, and old notes from college (why do I keep them?) There are shelves of art samples that I don't really like but keep anyway. My collection of stuffed animals sits on top of a bookcase, consists of:    2 Camels  2 Buzz Lightyear (1 full size 1 small)  1 star dancer  1 chameleon beenie baby  1 tiger beenie baby (fake)  1 lion beenie baby (fake)  1 wind-up koala (musical)  1 hand made doll with plastic face  1 creepy doll with green plaid jumper  1 sand filled lizard.  1 hand made red cat  1 orange cat with tabby blazer   These toys are now placed unceremoniously in a cardboard box waiting for there next home.  There is art on the walls, a Pink Floyd "The Wall" flag (purchased at Woodstock '99), A valedictorian plaque from grade school (his pride and joy), an annoying Ikea light with removable picture things (never used).   The bookcases are filled with books that aren't' good enough for the downstairs bookcase (mostly books on war or military). I am sure I'll have to find room for them downstairs.  There is a filing cabinet full of crap. The floor is dominated with the mattress from one of our pull out couches.   I am listening to Dark Side, "The time has come, the song is over, now there's nothing more to say".  (maybe she won't notice)

      My boss along with the girls from the office took me out to lunch to celebrate my recent engagement to my boyfriend.  It was lots of fun, everyone sharing wedding and engagement stories. There were only 2 people that weren’t engaged or married. So there was a lot of experience.  Who knew they celebrated “engagements” at the Lone Star. But like clockwork after the meal, out comes the waitress with a big foam novelty hat and a triangle yelling at everyone too look at the “engaged girl”  I had to stand on a chair like a moron, while they sang “ball and chain” to the tune of happy birthday, instead of Dear Brandy, they said Dear Loser… Thanks.  It was a strange experience. But the food was good, and the company was good. I got a card signed by most of the people in the office, which was very nice.  YIPPEE! I am getting Married! It becomes more real with every day. Three hundred and thirty seven days to go.

      It's Friday again, where does the time go?  This week was a blur, this summer has been a blur. This morning it's 9oC, and I can feel my allergies starting (2 weeks early).  This weekend I have decided to not go home. I hope it doesn't result in more wedding stuff planned without me. So far the groom's family (who is holding the ceremony) has a band in mind and a location. Both are not what I had in mind. I am sure they will agree with me once I get to talk with them.  Instead I am going shopping with a good friend who is back in the area. After spending 2+months in Nunavut I am anxious to see her.  The sun is making it's way across my computer screen, I can't see anymore for the glare.  I hope everyone in blog world has a great day.

      You could smell fall in the air this morning, It was 11oC when I walked to the bus stop.  Fall isn't a bad thing, but it's August 5th! Ottawa hasn't had a summer (from what I have heard), it's the coolest summer since 1992. I like the cooler weather. Not great for swimming, or my garden, but nicer than 30 in the shade.  Today will be a crazy day. I am doing MTO testing and have to wait until 8:00 am sharp before I can start the testing. (you wouldn't believe the rules) The main stuff should take me straight through lunch, then the secondary stuff will wrap up the day.  I started a new book this morning, I have let the wedding take over my life for the past 6 days and decided that I need some normalcy (sp?). So I picked up a book that was recently lent to me "UFO Headquarters: Investigations on Current Extraterrestrial activities in Area 51" You can't get any more normal than that. It's good so far, typical top secret stuff.  7:45, 15 min till it starts.

      Today I am going to the Cornwall hydro dam to do sampling. I have never been to a generating station and it sounds like it will be fun. Me and a co-worker will be sampling for zebra mussles under the St Laurence river.  If it goes well I'll be doing this once a week for the rest of the summer and into the fall. Afterwards I'll be playing Bio-Tech, sitting at a microscope counting the bastards.  Wish me luck.

      After my first weekend of being engaged I arrive at work…  I had no idea what it was going to be like. With in 1 hour I had people coming up to me congratulating me on the engagement. How did all these people know so fast? I had only told 3 out of 55 people in the office.  I checked my email and the Office weekly summary pops up. #2 on the list is my engagement. Looks like my friend found a quick way of telling everyone.  Soon after I have people visiting my make-shift cube (they even know that my ring is in my pocket and not on my finger) Asking me all kinds of question, luckily I have answers. I am glad I’ve had a few months to secretly plan in my head.  This engagement wasn’t exactly a surprise. My boyfriend and I decided back in April that getting married would be a good thing to do. From there it progressed to me picking out the ring, and him getting it specially made buying it, then a month later proposing.  The more people I talk to the more real it becomes. I had no idea how complex a wedding can be.  Everyone has great advice, and its fun to hear about there wedding experiences.  I think the first thing I am going to do is find a wedding planner. I am so overwhelmed. The perfect person would be my Mom, I hope she’s up for it.
