       I&nbsp;have always been  clumsy &nbsp;and stupid, careless and extremely    pea-brained   , ignorant&nbsp;yet easily&nbsp; BROKEN .&nbsp;but there once came one day where i swore,swore&nbsp;determinantly, that i'll never fall again.     i am not so sure anymore .        &nbsp;

      I've always believed in fairy tale    romance   , being a girl grown up with Disney's Princess and Prince charming.   have I ever been swept away by this power emotion that makes the world go around?   or is  16  too young an age to experience the geniune  love  between two individuals?   i thought i have found it not once, but  twice . looks like i had been blind in my judgement.  I am just a young, romantic girl who wants a guy to love her more than she does, a guy to take charge, a guy to give his support, advice and love. I want someone who enjoys pampering me, who can take me as I am, my past my history,&nbsp;someone looking&nbsp;for a love to last.&nbsp;one who I would never need to put up a pretence, a lover I could show all sides of me, a friend who will always be by me, a person I never have to use words to communicate with,    a special individual  .    is looking for such an individual too difficult in a society where interaction has&nbsp;becomes cold and remote and distant?  Like Disney always portrays it:    someday,&nbsp;my prince will come .     i  hope &nbsp;it exist&nbsp;in our reality world.  &nbsp;

      100 DAYS to go.  will our friendship ever improve? i felt sad when she doesn't tell me what's she thinking. i know there's obviously lots in her mind, but she NEVER says. i always get a shock reading her blog, it upsets me when she doesn't say the smallest things that are on her mind. i find myself learning more about her when i read her blog, the intensity of her crush, the small thoughts that ran through her mind.   i'm all ears, always for her. i hope she knows that.   i read somewhere in her blog saying that she could tell her partner in class everything, regarding from her family stuff to her crush. but i never hear from her.  maybe its me, perhaps i don't put in enough effort. perhaps i don't seem overly concerned.  i love her, i hope she knows.

      i think i just want to be a little more normal today than to try to portray my thoughts in a more abstract way. &nbsp; i'm troubled. there's no denying this fact. while it seems to the entire world that i'm happy, i just feel like i got nowhere to channel my words and thoughts.  I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   if i love u i will let u go no matter how diff it is don't worry i will be fine...    I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   really   I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   don;t worry spread your wings and choose your path, i will support you fully    &nbsp; somehow i feel like i have  hurt a particular loved one.  i love her and respect her from my bottom of my heart. honestly i do, perhaps the choices i am going to make have to have her in consideration. i love you, mrs oon.  &nbsp; i ought to count my blessings. having several friends who pledged to be by me always, i know i'm lucky. joshua, my guides sisters. i don't know about the others.. although the unexpected happens when you expects least.  I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   don't worry of wat i want... like i say i love u enough to let u go    &nbsp;  friendship takes time to cultivate and time to grow . perhaps i am asking too much from people who are unable to give me that much within such a short period of time.  &nbsp; vanessa! i really love you and i'm willing to give you time. though i hope something will work out from it. i hope there will be a time where i can read your thoughts without listening to your words, to be able to be truly myself. &nbsp; I LOVE this GIrl!!! says:   I know we share a special bond and nothing will change that    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  i am not alone... am i?    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I think too much.  I have been thinking about my goal in life, what I want to achieve, who I want to be. What kind of friend I want people to take me as, what do I want people to remember me as?  then yesterday, I was asked a question. What will the scenario of my funeral be? Will there be a lot of people? What will people speak of me when I'm gone?  and I realised the answers to my questions I've been questioning.  what about you? If I'm gone someday, what kind of person would you remember me as?

      115 days to go. Many things happened today.  I don't know where to begin, but I wonder how everything will become. What does the future holds? Who will stay and who will go?  "the alchemist", a book I read yesterday spun me tales and stories about ideas, values and morals. I guess to believe in the present and to do what you feel like doing ultimately leads to your future. So if you want to sleep, you sleep. Feel like eating, you eat. I think that holds some truth.  every action taken today defines the future you have tomorrow.   I'm really thankful for everything I have in my life. The sudden appreciation, made me really glad today. I guess it boils down to how aware you are of your surroundings and the loved ones that care. =D I'm glad I opened my eyes wider.  I wanna tell the whole world how wonderful your life is, if you led a purposeful life. Remember this?  " I'm on the top of the world looking, down on creation and the only explanation I can find. Is the love that I found, ever since you been around, your love put me at the top of the world."    that goes out to all my sisters and my dearie Joshie!

      116 days to go.   in our high paced life, interaction has become more remote and cold. at least, that's what i used to think so.  as i boarded bus 10 today,carrying a pile of files that covered my entire torso, i expected to stand amidst all the passengers. i am not pregnant, i don't see a single strand of white hair on my head yet i was offered a seat! by a small boy who couldn't be more than 10.  touched isn't the word. it was the sudden realisation that a warm touch still exist in our society. it was the sudden comprehension that i couldn't categorize everybody and label them under one. it was also the sudden emotion that surged through me, the simplicity, innocence and goodwill of the boy and his father warmed my heart.  i guess, life is really worth living if you take the small yet significant matters to heart.

      i think thats what it all boils down to--- Perception.  i learnt to apply in life what i learnt in Photography. when you change your angle, you change what you see.   if you try to experience it from all angles, you will learn to realise things/people are not what you think you know.  it happened to me twice this year alone.  the stars are magnificantly bright today, when i changed my perception and look up instead.

      117 days to go.   Happiness is telling people how much you appreciated them.   Happiness is watching their faces lit up with joy when they are told that they are appreciated.   I once boarded this SBS bus whose driver greeted everybody when they boarded, and greeted them goodbye when they drop off. Not many returned his greetings, but i was greatly impressed. He waited for those chasing the bus, and yet greeted them with a smile instead of the usual cursing.   This man changed my perception, and made me realised  a little do go a long way.    i wrote him a thank you note, and the smile he exchanged with the note was priceless.   that's what happiness is.

      prematial sex. teenage pregnancy.   i have a dream.   a dream of the day where i could make a difference in this harsh world we live in.   a fantasy?  i want to teach teenagers about self respect. about self love. about loving themselves, before loving their partner.   these prevalent issues are here to stay. "WHY" is the question i want to ask, "HOW" does true love = making love? at what price are teens willing to sell their soul, their trust?   i'm depressed.

      118 days to go. another  depressing  day.   a mother in the foodcourt, sharing a plate of chicken rice with  her two sons. unable to afford another, they buy another plate, a plate of plain rice.   opposite their table, two teenage girls with their plates half full. they rose to leave.  the newspaper spoke of a the tale of young innocent children, scavaging the rubbish dump to put food on the table while the other end of the earth plays a movie of a man, overstuffed with Macdonalds.   someone mentioned, life is unfair. hard irony, it's true isn't it? peace, love, warmth -- have they all become nothing but myths?

      "Human words Contrived for communication Fail to crystallise the concept of beauty- A notion of elegance That defies tangible classification  Only When we learn to take alternate views And discard the strictures of  Purpose-bound Thought, Can we grasp the outline of Nature's venacular Only then... Can we begin Comprehension and Portrayal"

      Having just watched a documentary about Joel, a young man  scarred and charred by traces of his past , an accident that shaped his being and burns that leaves it marks forever, i felt that i got many blessings to count.  Have you ever wondered what it feels like to have no fingers? Or to no longer need to shape or comb that locks of yours? Being able to walk in being unnoticed, with nobody paying special attention or giving stares that could hurt an individual for life?  Yet he still stand strong, with dignity, faith and forgivness. In a court testimonial, 18 years after that tragic accident, he told the driver that he has no hatred, for   hatred only brings misery  . How true and touching. His apperance and life were moulded in hands of a stranger he never met, someone who had altered his route so drastically yet isn't someone he knew of. And to be able to forgive the man who robbed the chance of living a normal life was indeed a tremendous deed that needs more than just courage.    I have everything   some people longed and are deprived of.  Little things in life that are frequently neglected and overlooked.  The world is full of many such people like Joel. Those who do have everything a simple life grants,   reflect and realise how lucky you are in other's eyes.     Sometimes, money isn't everything that makes the world go round.

      It is a   Monday  .  Yet another   boring   *yawns*  start of the week.  The day where we had double periods of almost everything.  The day I usually feel extremely tired and  groggy.   But   not   today.  The world just glowed today, I feel contented and lucky just to be even breathing. Despite the fact that I've caught a cold. =)  happy . delighted.   gleeful  .  cheery . gay.   ecstatic  . joyful.  euphoric .   exuberant  .  delighted .  thrilled   are the words to describe.  I felt like somehow something have changed. It all just came suddenly, the sudden realisation and appreciation of having Vanessa in my life. Somehow, it seems that our relationship had improved, and that she could understand me. Somehow, somehow. I don't know if what i'm feeling will be for a longer period of time. I do hope so.   Someone out there just filled my head the entire day . The entrance of that person somehow brightened my life. Then again, i question the existance of this feeling I harbour and its significance, i wonder if its real and lasting, if the story would have a nicer ending. My history haunts me, much as I try to forget. So much thoughts, so little time to clear it.  I'm happy, i hope it'll last. =)   Only time can tell  . So true.
