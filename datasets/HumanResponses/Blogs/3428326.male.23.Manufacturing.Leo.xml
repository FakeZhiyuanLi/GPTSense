      like driving into on coming traffic...like getting a rope and finding a tall tree to clime.....like just not getting out of bed......like the world was against you...helpless....depressed.....hate.....love....like hate loves you....like love hates you...like no matter what you do or how hard you try it never gets better....like parking on the RxR tracks and taken a nap in the bed of your truck....like things have to get worse before they can get better but know that the best you have ever seen is worse than you ever wanted...like no one listens...like you listen to no one, or for some reason try to listen but cant or wont.....Have you ever  FELT ??? I HAVE. I DO. I always do and I know no matter what anyone says, its not going to help how I feel.  FEEL  lmmfhfao !!!!  LIFE IS A BOOK. IF YOURS IS GOOD KEEP READING. IF ITS A BAD BOOK, READ ON ANY WAYS BUT IM READY TO PUT MINE ON THE TABLE AND SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S  NOT  IN MY BOOK

      I just got home from  my fist day of work since thanksgiving. Its fuckin 330 in the morning.....Its supposed to be a second shift job. I got in some trouble in November and lost my last job, the judge gave me 6 months to pay my fines...Well 6 months is up in 3 weeks and I haven't paid anything on it yet. Finally I get a job $8 an hour second shift .....My shift starts at 3 in the afternoon. Its a meat packing plant I get to put hamburger patties in boxes all night, its a brisk 48 degrees in there but it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. Most of the people are nice but have no since of humor and the place is cram packed with good lookin girls. At that point most guys would think 'heaven' good lookin women walkin around with T.H.O. all day. Yea that's great and all but I like to know what time I'm gettin off work. This stayin till 230 in the morning just aint gonna cut it.....If I didn't need this job so bad, trust me , I wouldn't be going back tomorrow. I'll tell ya this though, I sent out 3 resumes today before I left for work , let one of them places call me back and I'm out of that hell hole and never looking back, and if they don't call then as soon as these fines are paid I'm gone any ways. My girlfriend probly thinks I'm out cheating on her. I doubt she's gonna believe that they don't tell when you are getting off work until its time to go...Well I got my gripe out for the day, yall taker easy and remember it could be worse.

      yep , I've screwed myself again . I'm currently on probation for my second D.U.I. , 16 months worth and a years suspended license . I live 15 miles from every where which means I'm driving while I'm on this suspention . Well I have to get a job to pay for my fines and costs . To make things worse they want me to go to alcohol classes  and  AA meetings , all well and good except the classes are 3 times a week and the AA is twice a week . That's 5 days a week I'm gonna be in counseling , 5 work week days . The classes are 6 pm to 9 pm , when I start working I'm gonna be working second shift , 3 pm till 11 pm , at least 5 days a week . The problem is this , if I don't get a job and pay , I go to jail , if I don't go to counseling , I go to jail . I have only enough time to do one or the other , not both . Well , I have to see the counselor on Wednesday at 10 am , hopefully we can work something out and make this work or I'm just gonna have to tell my P.O. to fuck off and do my time in jail , which I believe is 6 months (not sure on that one). Well the people are home and I got to get this published and get off here.

      yup I'm still alive....not that any of you care , but here I am. My puter crashed shortly after my last blog, up an runnin again as you can see. I lost half my shit tho and dunno where the other half is . I didn't think I was gonna be able to find my blog again. I got 2 checks in the last 2 weeks , $75 a piece , drank them both up when I should have sent them to my probation . Have to go and see them bastards today , hope they don't throw me in jail . Broke up with my girlfriend last week (giver take a few days) she called beggin for me back , tellin me she was sorry for blowin up at me over hearin a female voice in the background while I was on the phone with her . If she had ask me what was goin on before she cussed me and hung up on me , she would have know that it was my buddies ole' lady and not some chik she imagined I was seeing . That's ok , I think she is gonna give up on being jealous... I hope , heheheh. Never the less I gave her a second chance . Got a new job , worked 1 day was late the 2nd day by 15 minutes , the supervisor said it was kool but not to let it happen again but the temp service that sent me there called me and said that my assignment was finished and they didn't want me back , I'm gonna go ahead and show up on Friday and see what happens . The worst they can do is send me home . Been washin trucks with a buddy of mine tryin to make extra money , I didn't think he was gonna pay me but he dropped off $50 yesterday . Just in time too cuz that gives me just enough cash to fill my gas tank and pay my P.O. for the piss test he popped on me 2 months ago ... yayayayyyayay!!!
