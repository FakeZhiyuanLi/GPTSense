       T  his was a question asked to my by one of my dearest friends, Sarah. Though it was asked to me last week, I am just now realizing that it was kinda funny (yet, somewhat bitchy).       "So Taylor, do you think if you don't make out with anyone for a lot longer, you're going to forget?" ( I made some subtle changes to make it more funny because I'm probably the only person in the world who'll think it's funny) -Sarah  "Um....I don't know, I don't think so. I think it's kind of like riding a bike" -Taylor  (me)     What do you think?

       Oh my god, right now, right this second,  while I'm writing this, my dad is yelling at me. Oh my god. He's telling me I'm basically going to get raped and/or kidnapped because I'm going to a concert thing in a dangerous part of town. Did he care last week when I went, when I wasn't the one driving??  Nooo....he didn't. Huh. Interesting. "Back in my day..I wasn't driving in downtown Grand Rapids...no, I was helping my dad prepare his sermons for CHURCH!" That was a little exaggerated but it's pretty much the truth. I mean, I don't really want to be abducted TONIGHT but if I stay here, in this dumb-ass town for much longer, I'm sure that will change. It's like I can't be killed by a drunk where I live...noo....Because drunks only live there. They can suck it.  Until we meet again...

       I went to visit Grand Valley today. Oh god. I don't want to go! What am I going to do after I get there. I know I'm going to completely freak out. I'll bet you $5 that I'll call my mom sobbing. I'm such a baby. I know it's like a year away and I probably shouldn't be worrying about it too much at this point, but today it kind of set in. And I know for sure that I'll either gain 400 lbs or become anorexic. I'm not sure which. When I get really nervous I can't eat at all, but since there will be good food (there's a Taco Bell!!!) I may just devour everything within a 25 mile radius. Okay, I'm going to shut up now, it's summer.

       Dude, I just got home from playing paintball for 2 hours. It was so much fun! It was such a rush. The first time is was Max and I, one on one. I was screaming and I leaned out w/ my leg to shoot and he got me right in the thigh. I got hit in the face, the lenses of my mask, the hopper, and my finger. The only welt I have though is from the one on my thigh, it looks gross! After the first two games I got over screaming. All the guys I played with were really nice. They didn't let me win or anything, they were cool. &nbsp;I never hit anyone either but it was still fun. I stole this really neat paintball jersey from my brother, it doesn't fit him anymore, and it's really cool. Now my dad is screaming his head off because my brother is spoiled, go figure, it wasn't like my dad raised him or anything. Yeah, right. Whatever.

       ...The name of a band I am going to watch Friday night with Catherine and Zach. Speaking of being in the way, yeah. I honestly feel horrible. I wasn't supposed to be there. I was a growth...a cancerous one. I felt like a pain in the ass and I hate feeling that way. It's not anyone's fault. It's probably a good thing I was forced to feel&nbsp;that way. Sarah has endured her fair share of that through the years. But honestly, I hope certain people don't hate me. I know Sarah doesn't...I think. I don't want them to think I'm just a lemming who follows people around. I'm not that kind of person at all. That's enough of me trying to justify myself. I didn't know what was to come, if I would have....just, trust me.

       Last night was fan-fucking-tastic! I've waited for something like that all...well, my whole life. Three bands...the first, One For The Books, they were the "amateurs," they were HOT and basically all my age. The second, In The Know, they were old, fat, and awesome, the keyboard man was Asian and had a shirt on that said !YO *HEART* CUBA! it was awesome.&nbsp;And the main event, Streetlight Manifesto, 7 guys, the oldest probably 45. The way they dance, it's freaking cool as hell. I wanted to so badly but I had flip-flops on, plus, I was with Josh. If I'm gonna do something like that I need my boos (not booze (sp?)). I don't know what it is about that music that gets to me...maybe it's the trumpets and trombones and the sax. It's so original. I'm dumb because I keep talking about it. I'm going to go there atleast a couple more times this summer. Enough about that. I'm really sad for someone. This person doesn't deserve to be treated the way they are. To be kept up until 4 am upset because everything is&nbsp;their fault?? No...I'm sorry, this person doesn't deserve that. You have to deal with your own things, the other person's reaction is their own, it's their right to act the way they do. Do what you're going to do, be independent and think for yourself. Do what YOU need/want to do. Don't let others controls you. Anyways, it's a beautiful day and I want to go for a walk.

       Yeah, I saw it. It was no illusion. It was RIGHT THERE! The grossest thing I've ever seen in my life. I don't think I'll ever be the same again. I'm traumatized. And that's all I have to say about that.

       Today I went to the fair, yet again. It was fun though, except for the fact I was falling asleep the entire time. Ben called me though and invited me, that made me happy because it means that other people do know that I'm alive LOL. It was fun cause we stole a bunch of 'Got Milk?' pencils, and I drank some milk too, only $.50. It was great because I was thirsty and poor. My webcam is a piece, it is broken or something. I found the receipt though, I'm either going to exchange it or return it. It depends on my monetary situation. I definitely need to put the $33 back in the bank that I took out yesterday for literary purposes.&nbsp;It was worth it though. I wouldn't have traded yesterday for a delicious bass, that's FO SHO! Yumm, my mouth just waters when I think about that frappacino I bought twice. Tomorrow I have to awake at probably 6am to leave here at 6:45 to babysit, it sucks yes, but need the money. Then it's to work at 4 to endure 6 hours of Andrew and his rather large head. Until next time...

        Fuck this stupid invention called the internet. My day would have been&nbsp;perfect if it wansn't for it. Let me see, &nbsp;Steve told me he used to have a crush on me, which is just perfect, just perfect,&nbsp;except for the fact that he USED to have one. He said that he liked me before we really started to talk. I guess that is how it is though, I open my mouth then it all goes to shit.&nbsp; I told him I used to have one on him aswell, it's true, if used to can equal 15 minutes before that conversation happened, then it's true. Honestly, why the hell did he feel the need to tell me that? Yeah, he's an honest&nbsp;guy and what not; but&nbsp;did it make me feel better?? NO. Was I already on the verge of tears?? YES. That was the straw. I can't take it. I don't know why I let things bother me.&nbsp;That shouldn't have made me upset at all. It just made me feel&nbsp;really uninteresting, I have nothing intelligent to say.&nbsp;I just...I need to go to bed. In the morning, it will be a new day, a fresh start. It will be wonderful.

       I feel alot better. I hope you do too.   I kind of have a stomach ache because I ate some cake. It was chocolate with white frosting...mmm. I went to get a second piece though, I took the first bite then this commercial came on T.V.with&nbsp;these kids saying how they were called so fat&nbsp;and they were&nbsp; sad, then SUBWAY opened their eyes, they were like 10 and they had lost weight by eating there. It made me want to cry...I put the cake back.   "...Now we were both in motion again, moving ahead. So what if there were questions left unanswered. Life went on.

And&nbsp;I guess in that case,when that starts to happen,&nbsp;unfortunately, it's going to be out of my control.&nbsp;It may seem like I don't think that is a big deal but I do.

       I went to church this morning. It was 73% better than usual because our regular butch one pastor wasn't there, she's always has a&nbsp;biased opinion anyway. The man who led us seemed really cool...I honestly think I would go to church more often if there was someone I enjoyed in charge. That's just an excuse though I guess. I have so many questions though, if I went more comfortable with our minister I think I could ask them and figure out what&nbsp;I am doing and believing in. It would be better to know what it is I am believing, since I  am  believe in it. This really inticed me to come back next week, (I'll probably go to the early service, I have some "friends" who go to that one) there was this guy who&nbsp;was AMAZING that played the piano and he sang. Let me tell you, Josh Groban, you've got nothing on this kid.   I haven't really done much today. I started  The Catcher In The Rye... it hasn't caught my attention at this point, (page 17)but Sarah said that I'd probably like it. I went to Felpausch and bought some healthy food. Thank God for these new snacks...they are old snacks but they come in packages and are only 100 calories. I've been doing really really well this last week eating and I'm not going to stop. I lost about 4 lbs and hopefully I can lose 5 or so more by the time my senior pictures come around in a couple of weeks. Let's see, what else...I have to go to work at 6, I'm dreading it to say the least. I have to go back tomorrow for a WHOLE day with a manager I don't know. I figure I'll bring some reading material...I'm sure he doesn't know we're not supposed to. If he says something, all I will tell him is, 'Suck it'...ha, yeah right. I would never do that. I would very much want to, but in reality that'd never happen. I've started making a little photo album on bolt. It's not working at the moment, and it's small and sucks but I think I'll to put the link on here so if anyone wants to they can see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, here's a scary thought for ya, I went to yahoo.com and typed in the title of my blog: a day in the life of a rock star. The first listing is of course, my blog. I really doubt anyone would type that in exactly but anything even close to that, it would probably give them my blog as one of the links. And that's all I have to say about that. Until next time...     urlLink  http://bolt.com/profile/photos/index.jsp?memberName=sunfire63&amp;pageNum=1       Who knows if that'll work.

        Today was a long,&nbsp;day. It was about 75% good.&nbsp;I had my cake and let me tell you, I&nbsp;ate it too...yes, I&nbsp;ate it too. &nbsp;I woke up and babysat at 7:30. I went to Nikki's birthday party, that was fun except for the imbreeder stories (I suppose it did make it interesting though), and Cowboy camps they are basically all going to. I forgot that Hailey Norton actually can be nice if she wants. I was kind of depressed though because I had a smi-sad conversation with Sarah about friendship and life. I mean, it wasn't bad but it was depressing, somewhat. Then I'm nervous, like a mofo over absolutly  nothing ! My mind is always racing, except when I count before I go to bed. It's kind of a ritual I've developed when I can't focus on falling asleep. I just lay there and count...it gets my mind to relax. (that was a little bit random)&nbsp;I'll be nervous the rest of my life&nbsp;though, I swear. &nbsp;I just want things to be like they were in 1oth grade. Things have changed with me alot this year...maybe even this past spring/summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly don't know how though.&nbsp;Other people (just one actually) have noticed things though about me. They (he)&nbsp;said I'm different, but  don't know why &nbsp;either, I really wish he could explain what it is, it would just be nice to know. But once again I need to lighten up. I'm going to bed.

      Good lord it's early. I suppose it's lateish but since I went to bed at a ridiculous time when having to get up "early" today...yeah, bad idea. I have to go to work today, I think a couple people might visit me though, so that might help break up my day a little bit. I have a song on my mind:  This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  I'll tear us apart  Can I be your enemy  Losing half a year  Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  Tearing out my heart  I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings disappear  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   Can I be your memory   -Sugarcult  Carpe Diem!

      -Uhhh, I like it like that he's workin that back, i don't know how to act, slow motion for me...-   Today was freaking  depressing ! I woke up, got on the computer, practiced piano, showered, practiced piano, read, watched TV, practiced piano, went to piano lessons, the went to SARAH's house (that part wasn't depressing, except that there was a scary movie!) Yeah, now I'm just comtemplating tomorrow: Work, 10-6. I suppose there isn't much to comtemplate, I go there, give people popcorn for 8 hours, then leave.   I might go on a date next week. I'm excited, unless it turns out badly, then yeah...not really excited. But I haven't really been out w/ a guy (atleast not a "DATE") in like 6 months, which isn't a bad thing but it will be a nice change, I hope.. If he calls me, which he said he would. He  better ! I don't want to make my friend by mad at me and hate me forever though. I just wish we had the same taste in guys. Hopfully if I ever enter into a relationship again I can make better decisions and handle certain things differently.  I don't know, I might get something that makes me happy and it ends up making  me sick. That is always the case with me though; once I get something I want, I don't want it anymore. Maybe lightening up would help me.   *Teen Girl Squad*- I'm  totally  crushing!

       I need to get this all straight. At least down on "paper" of sorts. I might not post this. I'll see how it develpoes.    Zach...he likes me in that  "extra special"  kind of way. I like him, I don't know if it's in that "extra special" way. He's completely the type of guy that I would be in to. But I don't think there is  chemistry  between us. I want there to be.  Curtis...he's  "going after me,"  in the words of, friend/ex boyfriend, Josh. If it's true, I don't think I'd have a problem with it one bit. I don't know what it is about this kid. He does  something  to me. (That sounds weird/creepy)  "We talk sometimes and she wrote me an e mail. I think I'll go for it."  Now Curtis, I've liked him since probably the first 1/3 of second semester last year. I  stopped  liking him when he stopped talking to me for some apparently, unknown reason. I wouldn't want that happening again. I saw him the other day. I think I forgot about him until then. Now I'm having a hard time trying to  forget . I really  hope  he "goes after me" as bad as that sounds.  Josh...The  ex boyfriend , who just, in the past 2 weeks, broke up with his girlfriend of oh, probably 7 months. He told me:  "As much as I think Curtis needs a girlfriend, he can't have you" * "Just tell him you like me, [Josh] a lot"  What is this all supposed to  mean , damn it?! (You bet I tried to get it out of him) We broke up. Does that mean he still likes me, or likes the thought of a girl 24/7? We didn't "click" so to speak. Dose he not remember? We  broke up  for reasons. We had good times. Josh is very capricious with girls. lol...it's his personality; he doesn't go without girlfriends for very long. He's looking already; I  know  it, that's how he is. He'll deny it forever.  "I'm going to try really hard to make it without having a girlfriend through homecoming." "Yeah, good luck with that"     ----------------------------------------------------    Oh you, when you look at me, you make me feel so glad. Oh you, when you smile at me, you make me feel so nervous. Cause you're the one I adore-  Ozma

       Note to self: I've been posting way too much. I need to limit myself to  every other day or so, but this is important!    My frog, Otto, died last night. It was unexpected. I went up at 11:30 to put on my PJs and he was alright, he looked a little tired, but nothing I thought twice about. Then, I went back up to go to bed at 1 and he was dead. Belly up, under the blue thing that shoots out bubbles. Maybe he got trapped. I've had Otto for about 2 months now and I got really attached. He was the best frog ever, and I'm not just saying that because he was my frog. He used to swim into the bubbles from the air pump, get pushed away and keep doing that over and over again, like a whirl pool. He did flips and jumps a lot too. That's what I'll never forget. I cried last night for about 5 minutes straight. I mean, it doesn't take much for me to cry but over a frog? The size of a walnut. I realize though now, size doesn't matter, it's what's inside those counts. :) I'm such a loser! I want to get another frog, to keep Harry (my goldfish) company, you know? I think I'll wait a little bit before I do.   In other news, the newest Employee of the Month at the Hastings 4 is none other than yours truly, ME!! Guess what they gave me?! KERNEL KORN! He's all mine! I'm so excited! It's awesome! Also, I got basically 15 new CDs from Catherine. She got an MP3 and let me copy it onto my computer! I'm so excited.

       I’m sorry. I really am. I don’t know what else to do. When I get “attacked” I don’t just take it (you didn’t literally “attack” me, but it’s like I can’t have my own opinions, I can’t respond). You know that. Why are you surprised? I’ve always done it, and probably always will. That’s my personality. I have character flaws, and you (along with the rest of the world) have them too. Like I said, I don’t know what else to do.      You don’t have to stay, but I hope that you would anyway; all you do is up and go –The Starting Line

       The longest day of my life. It wasn't bad. Some parts were depressing, but all in all, it was a really good day. I woke up today, (yesterday, I suppose, but I haven't gone to bed yet) at 7:30 and we went to visit MSU (Michigan State University). It was fine. I didn't love it. I'm struggling with this whole college thing. I had several mini breakdowns during the long, drawn-out day (at MSU); consisting of teary eyes, nausea, feeling as though my stomach was going to sink to my feet, and one full breakdown after calling someone a "Chink" or something. I'm ignorant. I didn't know it was that bad, after all, Catherine said it...lol. Anyways, everyone laughed, mostly in disbelief, after those words left my mouth. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I started to sob in my mom's lap. I'm such a baby. It was my own fault. I felt so stupid. I guess that's what I get for growing up in a non diverse, Republican town of about 10,000. That's an excuse though. I should know better.  After MSU, we had been planning on going to Skelltones to see some bands play, but we decided against it. Instead we went to Relay for Life. I probably walked about 4 or 5 miles total. But it was just really fun talking. When we came back, after coming home for a couple minutes, I brought some blankets and Cody, Sarah, and I all watched the stars. For the first time in my life I saw not one, but two shooting stars. It was awesome! Ahh...Another embarrassing story: I was walking past a tent thing and I swear, I saw Cody's mom. So I go, "Hi Mrs. DePew!", she looks at me for a second, smiles like she doesn't know what the hell is going on, and waves slightly. As all of that is happening, Cody leans over, laughing...it wasn't his mom. It looked just like her too. I was laughing so hard, making myself cry! I guess it was just a day for tears.  I ran into an "old friend" today.He actually ran into me. It was good ole Curtis! I had a crush on him last year. Then, one day he stopped talking to me. He told me that he tried to e mail me, it came back to him. That made me a little bit happy. When he said, "bye" I swear that he looked at me and did a little eyebrow "thing", I'm sure it was all in my head though. That was it. My day. My  whole  day. Thank you, you've been a wonderful audience!

       urlLink     Okay, so this is my car of choice. HA! Right. Except it's red. Either way, it's broken at the moment. Bummer. I'm carless and boyfriendless. Those two arn't really related, I don't think. Just making a point. So I try starting my car a couple more times, probably 5 or 6, and when it still doesn't start. That's when I pop the hood. I know nothing about cars. At all. Yet, I still open the hood and look under it, thinking, some way, somehow, something about cars will come to me and I'll be able to magically fix it somehow.   urlLink

       I just saw 'Little Black Book' with Cody, Sarah, and Catherine. It was the best movie! It wasn't all cliche` (sp?) like 98.9% of all those other "romance" movies. I loved it. This morning, Sarah and I awoke at 7:30 so we could go take pictures for the yearbook. It was really fun. I was skeptical about wanting to do it but I think I'm pretty sure that I do. The camera we are using is awesome, it probably cost somewhere around $1,300, maybe more, I don't know. After taking the pictures, we came home, made the best pancakes ever, with chocolate chips and blueberries, and watched 'Dawson's Creek', that Dawson, I gotta hand it to him, he is dealt some pretty messy situations, but does he get down, ohh...no sir, he handles them with the upmost maturity lol. I found this great song, the title is the subject and it's by a band called *COUNT THE STARS* You should download it and listen to it over and over until you can't stand it anymore. Here are the lyrics:     This air is contagious No one can save us, nothing this good could ever last And tonight is a drug, that I won't give up This is my favorite addiction The summer comes to a close,and no one knows what we know No one knows  I can't explain, what made me stay I fall into the same mistakes Like all good things They never last The past is past  I'd rather be drowning, than swimming away That's something that will never change I swallow regret, and hope for the best If this is all that i can do  This is why I never try, to make it seem we shouldn't leave This is why I never try  This air is contagious, no one can save us, but I wait  I must confess, I'm not impressed There's nothing worse than losing you I must confess, I'm not the same like all good things

       I was just eating a bagel with peanut butter and honey on it and I realized that I got the peanut butter all over the computer mouse. I'm a pig. Speaking of that, I need to start eating well again, before school starts. I can't start down a bad path again. I think once I can start sleeping in again, I'll be alright. Since I've had to work at bible school this week I've had to get up insanely early and when I wake up early, I eat the world. It doesn't really make sense, but it just seems to happen.    I got my senior pictures taken today. I loved it. It was a lot of fun. I was kind of afraid at first, but after the four hours it took...I got comfortable. What can I say? The camera loves me. hahaha. I got these glasses from the dollar store tonight. They are HUGE and say 'Sexy' on them in Rhine stones. I copied Cody/Sarah/ Catherine. I don't care though because they are so awesome. I got two new CD's today! I burned them, I love burning CD's, especially since I'm broke. I burned the new Taking Back Sunday CD from Sarah and Maroon 5 from Catherine. I'm listening to Maroon 5 now. It's really good! It kinda sucks, we were planning on going for our "annual" skinny dip tonight. I was tired and cranky though and it was bloody cold! Brrr! Maybe another time. It's soo fun! I'm out!

        I have a big mouth. I really do. I can't help it. I always say things and   don't mean to. They just kind of come out in the moment. Sorry.   I'll try to   work on that.    Ben didn't come over. I was kind of looking forward to just hanging out,   just because I don't really have anything else to do. It's alright   though...I've been doing stuff for the past two days and I need to be   by myself for a little bit. Oh, he was going to burn me Big &amp; Rich   too...haha, I'm a hick! He bought it yesterday and we listened to it the   whole time. I started to like it after listening to it 9 times.    We went to Rockford yesterday. We were looking for a store w/   "paranormal" stuff in it. It wasn't really what we thought...there were just   a bunch of witch books. That stuff creeps me out. We also went to   Low's...they were looking for an EMF detector or something. We couldn't   find one. Then we ate at Catina, or something. A nice, cute boy   waited on us... :). When we came back to town, we went swimming and it was  crazy. We played MarcoParker....basically Marco Polo with some   adjustments.   I'm sneaky, let me tell you .   I think I'm going to go see Anchorman tonight. I heard it was bad but   there's nothing much of anything else to do. Plus, I haven't done anything    with Sarah in a few days. I'm broke too, movies are basically the only  thing I can do without having money.   Besides staying home, and that is   boring when I've already been doing that all day. This whole post, I've   just come to realize is about nothing. It's boring, but that's me. Um...I   have my senior pictures tomorrow, hopfully I don't look like a monster.   They usually do a pretty good job of making ugly FAs look decent,   so I think I'll be ok.   //*\\And if these are my parting words, then make this my last request.   Hold me here, until I sleep//*\      ...until next time

       urlLink     Okay, this was a picture taken at the cemetery right by my house, earlier this summer. Isn't that creepy?! Other pictures that we took had orbs in them but this was one of the scariest ones. I know taking pictures at a cemetery is creepy and demented. Sadly, that's one of the most exciting things I've done this summer. HA! I wasn't actually there when this picture was taken either, because I was too afraid, my best friend took this.   urlLink

       Oh god. I'm alive. It was touch and go there for awhile. I went today, with Catherine, to Grant to see this band play. I still don't know where it is and I was there all night. I really didn't know what to expect. We left here at 5:50 almost on the dot and didn't arrive there until 8:30. I can hardly get somewhere when I actually  do  know where it is, let alone have to navigate as well (Catherine was doing a really good job though). Catherine and I had never yelled at eachother that much in our entire friendship as much as we did tonight. It was scary! I probably broke 100 laws just driving there. Luckily, the drive home was a bit easier, that only took us an hour and a half. I learned how to read road signs! I know this is a lot of pointless ramblings but I'm buzzing. Anyway, we got there and it's this campground with all these drunk people smoking, white trash...You know. We get out of the car and we were instantly cast members of The Simple Life 3. We looked  so  out of place.  I got the book The Perks Of Being A Wallflower today, I'm excited to read it! Now for a song...  Staying home alone on a Friday Flat on the floor looking back On old love Or lack thereof After all the crushes are faded And all my wishful thinking was wrong I'm jaded hate it  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  Searching all my days just to find you I'm not sure who I'm looking for I'll know it When I see you Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom Staying up all night just to write A love song for no one  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here  I could have met you in a sandbox I could have passed you on the sidewalk Could I have missed my chance And watched you walk away?  I'm tired of being alone So hurry up and get here So tired of being alone So hurry up and get here You'll be so good You'll be so good for me  *Love Song For No One*-John Mayer
