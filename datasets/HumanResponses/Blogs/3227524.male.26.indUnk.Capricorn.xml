      morning feels so much brighter when there's so much to look forward to. or isit just in de mind?  camera pulak meragam...  slept at 3. woke up at 6. solat and off to work at 7. at home at 6 in the evening with eyes dat looks so red i could be mistaken to be one of those drug addicts.  this song has been playing in my head for too long; dygta - tak bisa memiliki (somehow rather i am unable to access thru the lirik website for this lirik but believe me. its dat good. even for an indon indie band. i think not?)

      my eyes can barely open and i'm straining to see through the open slits. my stomach is growling and there is no food in the house. with my parents somewhere in jurong west taking care of their cucu's, i'm basically forcing my mind to think hard on what to have for dinner tonight. meggi? already checked. none. bread? malas nak goreng telor hancur. will probably go out later at night to the nearby 7-11 to catch something. i don't know what, but it better be fulfilling. there's some strained on my right calf, probably from too much walking. work was as usual. hectic. tiring. wish i could take another 2 months leave. didnt really enjoy my leave last april which was spent mostly deep in my books gunning for the may exams.   its been a long time that i go for jogging and my ippt is due in 3 weeks time. i'm only aiming for a pass but if i get a silver, thats an additional 100 bucks in my pay. but a pass would be sufficient for me. not looking too much in my life. getting mellower each day. its probably the age. not getting any younger. sometimes i feel that its a sin to be feeling this way at my age. should be enjoying life and exploring the world. travel and learn! but when you're living in sunny singapore, there's hardly any time to even ponder to think abt what to enjoy for tomorrow. let alone today!   keluar rumah luar dah gelap. balik rumah luar pon gelap. sigh...bila mau game braderrr.

      alermek just now nearly failed my first aid course sia. kalau fail memang lah tak tahu nak cakap apa. muka pon tak tahu nak simpan kat mana. i don't know why tengah buat CPR tetiba ter-kancheong and jadi gabra. dapat result fail my cpr. kena ambik lagi. for me, kalau sekali fail mesti jadi gabra gila. phobia. still remember that i nearly drowned in a swimming pool. sampai hari ni masih phobia dengan air. even though i know how to swim, tapi bila sekali dah nak drown, terus takut masuk air.   i have a friend dulu yang laugh at me for having phobia in swimming. harlow, drowning is no silly matter ok. antara hidup dan mati. if i see her car, nak pancitkan all the tyres.  anyway that idiot who failed me in my CPR, brother, i'll never forget your face and your name. your name is Kelvin right. one day i see you at your workplace, i'll puncture you car tyres also.  okay peace. marah selalu pon tak bagus. sakitkan hati ajer.

      went for a crash course on first aid today somewhere around thompson. finally managed to understand fully how to conduct a good CPR and a successful heimlich manoureve (i have no idea how to spell this word). you can never know when you might be needed to apply those actions so it doesnt hurt to learn these few life-saving skills.  saluted those paramedics on rounds. strangers basically placed their lives in the hands of these people to save them. angels on the roads as one of my friend would describe them...   .

      i've finally managed to upload my fav song in here. means a lot to me so try to enjoy it...   Melissa    Hembusan angin senja membawaku ke sana Di situ cinta bermula Kau berikan senyuman Padaku yang keseorangan  Hadirmu dalam hidupku membuat ku terlena Di buai mimpi yang indah Kemesraan yang terbina Menghapuskan segala derita  Di tepi pantai ini Terukir satu memori Sungguh indah kurasakan Senyum di bibirmu Sinaran matamu Senyum dibibirmu Dewiku oh Melissa Oh Melissa Kau kupuja oh...  Kekosongan hati ini telah dimiliki Ku tak sendiri lagi Kemesraan cinta kita Kan kekal selamanya oh Melissa  i've first heard it during my NS days in 1999. it kinda makes you wanna go back to the 80's and just immersed yourself in the mood. it kinda makes you wanna drive up to the beach at night, light up that marlboro and just sit by the sea with this song on the background. i still love going to east coast at night, just to sit around watch the planes take off. it stuck with me until today. there will always be a part of your life that you just know that there is that one song that you can never forget. for your information, Helter Skelter is a singaporean band made up of poly students during the 80's. if i'm wrong, pls correct me then.   peace.  bloodshed. 0203.

      life after exams felt queer. queer in the sense that i dont have that lingering feeling of the impending exams anymore. it felt wierd. some kinda loss. such like it felt when i was taking my A levels. or even my O levels. wont be seeing my old classmates anymore. not even looking forward to seeing my new classmates this coming July. school is definitely taking its toll on my life. but if i don't get that degree, i guess it would feel much worse.  work was only sanity.  some people say i'm a strict workaholic. work was my life and studies was just a past time hobby. i dont know how long i can stay working at this pace. magazines always say, stop and smell the roses. dont run, walk, look around and you'll know that the path is never that long and ardous. its the journey that matters most.  i have to learnt to take life less seriously. but poeple all around don't seem to agree to have that same idea. come on buck up! get married! make babies! lots and lots of babies! book that date! book the car! save more money!  what happens to "hey try to enjoy getting married. its only once in a lifetime. why run when you can walk. everything will turn out fine. don't worry too much. just enjoy the moment."  i fel that i understood better what john lennon meant when he said  "life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans"   its time my mountain bike comes out from the toilet and onto the road again. time to travel again...

       "i'll tell you a secret about the gods. the gods...they envy us. they envy us because we are mortal" -troy   humans are a fascinating creature. we are often so busy looking for what's in front of us that we often forget where we are right now. we have our jobs. our careers to think of. our savings and our house deposits and our loans to take care of. that monthly car installments and that payment to take care of.  you ever take the mrt at 8am in the morning and instead of looking down on the floor and walking straight, try walking and looking straight ahead. or even better, try moving your head from side to side while you're walking and you'll see an amazing sight in front of you. instead of that morning sunshine that you can see, you'll ultimately will be surrounded by hundreds of ants scurrying around trying to get nowhere. sometimes its a wonder to see normal human beings waking up so early in the morning, bathed and forcing their bodies out of the house running to work and still be able to look exactly alike with one another.  doesnt matter what perfume you're wearing and doesnt matter if that shirt was just bought or that tie was a gift when i can only see one face on their eyes. its lunacy. now imagine doing like that for the rest of your lives.  it often takes that just one bit of calamity in your life just to make sure that you realised that its not always about you. but i'll guess when that time comes, its kinda will be a bit tad too late. roses don't always stay bloomed all the year round. they wilt and they die.  we all think we'll live forever. but the sad fact is we are not gods and we will not be able to clean our arse using our own left hand for the rest of our lives. because when the time comes when someone else has to come and help us clean that shit, you'll wonder why you've never died earlier.  thank GOD its raining tonight.

      "...she left as fast as the plane would have brought her away. it really doesnt matter how fast it was going. doesnt really matter where it goes, when it wants to go, all that matters is that she has left me here.   "...i wont be long. i'll still be the same as before. and i'll never stopped loving you as much as i've loved you now..."  but you know the reassurance that you desperately need wasnt really there.  deep down inside it just felt as if you were dangling on the edge of your heart hanging on to that solitary hand hoping that it would finally pull you up...  ...and i just allowed myself to slide.  a ferocious wind was blowing and i found myself blown away from that hand. i felt weak. i desperately tried to catch a pole just so i could get nearer to her. but slowly, i allowed myself to release my grip. very little at a time. but finally i let go totally. and i realized that it wasnt that bad after all. i was free falling.   i just allowed myself to slide.  it was so sad how time and space had changed everything. it was so nice when someone thinks you're special, treats them right, their trust in you is so precious. but all the same, we made mistakes and i've used up a few lives..."

      it never fails to amaze me local songs that has graced our local radio. with the likes of art fazil, lovehunters, kick! and so many other forgettable (mind the pun intended) names. came across this website that to me would definitely belong to the same clique as the others.  if you're free go here and listen to the songs.  urlLink www.serenaide.net    .  kinda reminds me of the 80's. personally loved the song named "the girl from katong" which always brings me back to that every mornings where i would spent forcing myself to wake up early, get dressed in my white school uniform and running haphazhardly to that bus stop just to catch a look of that crescent girl.  everybody has their morning fix of coffee. mine would be her smile. =)

      today's the big day. going back to work after a coupla of months of holidaying aka studying, its finally back to the chain gang. devoting a huge part of this body to the very needs of the government.  but before that i still have one more cycle of washing to be done. vacuuming was done well before noon and it was finished off with some mopping that ended up with me breaking the mop stick. i'm still asking myself how in the world did my mop stick broke into two. and my back still hurts for having to finish the last half of the house bend on my back looking like an idiot mopping with a short mopping stick.   gawd.  dusting. washing the dishes. changing the bed linings. enjoying the smooth feel of the clean nice-smelling floor. its not often  that i'm doing this. i could be just one of those mommy's boy that just enjoy cleaning the house when no one's at home. but most of the time you'd often find me lepaking (is there even such a word?) in my room, unbath, unbrushed and unsteady right in front of the TV, the PC and nothing else at all. in fact i've even perfected the art of acting interested while the mom is shouting at me to cleaned my act up.  gayish? sensitive new age guy a.k.a gay? womanly?  nah.  i just love doing this when they least expect it. less stress on the mind. try it.    i dare you.

       ROME (Reuters) - If you are thinking about speeding on Italian highways this year, think twice. You might find yourself being chased by a Lamborghini          Italian police show off their new Lamborghini patrol car during celebrations in Rome, May 14, 2004 to mark the force's 152nd anniversary. Italian police took possession on Friday of a sleek, 500 horsepower, two-seater Lamborghini Gallardo, which can hit a top speed of 300 kmh (185 mph). The sports car, painted in the police's distinctive blue and white colors, comes complete with a flashing blue light on the roof and will initially patrol the Salerno-Reggio Calabria motorway -- a road notorious in Italy for wild driving.  The Lamborghini will also be used to transport human organs for emergency operations.   and here we are chasing speed demons in Mazdas and Toyotas or even BMW's????  life aint never fair. argh!!

      for those that do NOT understand what this story is all about.    " Throughout time, men have waged war. Some for power, some for glory, some for honor – and some for love. In ancient Greece, the passion of two of literature’s most notorious lovers, Paris, Prince of Troy (ORLANDO BLOOM) and Helen (DIANE KRUGER), Queen of Sparta, ignites a war that will devastate a civilization. When Paris spirits Helen away from her husband, King Menelaus (BRENDAN GLEESON), it is an insult that cannot be suffered. Familial pride dictates that an affront to Menelaus is an affront to his brother Agamemnon (BRIAN COX), powerful King of the Mycenaeans, who soon unites all the massive tribes of Greece to steal Helen back from Troy in defense of his brother’s honor. In truth, Agamemnon’s pursuit of honor is corrupted by his overwhelming greed – he needs to conquer Troy to seize control of the Aegean, thus ensuring the supremacy of his already vast empire. The walled city, under the leadership of King Priam (PETER O’TOOLE) and defended by mighty Prince Hector (ERIC BANA), is a citadel that no army has ever been able to breach. One man alone stands as the key to victory or defeat over Troy – Achilles (BRAD PITT), believed to be the greatest warrior alive. Arrogant, rebellious and seemingly invincible, Achilles has allegiance to nothing and no one, save his own glory. It is his insatiable hunger for eternal renown that leads him to attack the gates of Troy under Agamemnon’s banner – but it will be love that ultimately decides his fate. Two worlds will go to war for honor and power. Thousands will fall in pursuit of glory. And for love, a nation will burn to the ground.   i've watched this movie and never has a story made me so riveted to the screen that i've hardly noticed how many hours had passed by. its a nearly 3 hrs epic saga but its so good that its definitely worth paying to watch it on a weekened.   greed. power. anger. cowardice. hatred. strength. and above all. love. love from a son. love from a father. love from a wife. and none to forget.  respect.  the only downside to this movie is the very fact that the man who started this war in the first place is the one still living in the end. that man couldnt even fight using a sword and had to resort using back his lord-of-the-rings-bow-and-arrow skills in order to kill achilles.  it would be much more nicer if orlando *gay* bloom had died instead.  but definitely. a damn good movie. 5 stars.  peace.

      somehow someway or another, most of us sanely goes through this patch safely one way or the other. for me, it definitely hits me right in the eye.   its a matter of whether you wanna stay eyes-closed and stay in the past looking backwards. then you're going to hit something, and you'll keep wondering why life keeps hitting you in the back.  or you can just keep closing your eyes and not moved an inch just to be safe and not get anywhere at all.  or you can casually open your eyes and let GOD teach you how to see how beautiful a black honda civic vti is on ur hands. but dats my fantasy. :)  tim allen summs it up the best. the greatest missile in the world is useless unless its targeted. a torpedo is adrift unless it has some place to go. an arrow is pointless unless it hits something.  you don't get me?  maybe this  urlLink  link   on the story will help you.   thanks to   urlLink ridjal.org    peace.

      my early morning was delicately spent forcing myself out of the bed, into the bathroom and into my t-shirt and jeans. before sanity gets to hit me bulls-eye into the head, i'm in the taxi with my mum and heading to the Jurong West Market which was somewhere near to JJC.  "wait for me here."  i barely listen to what she said before she scoots off into the market looking for whatever things that would make our kitchen smells so good. bought myself The Straits Times, trudged through the crowd and managed to find a seat beside an old pak-cik.  no matter how tired it would felt, it never tires my mind when reading through the papers. and today the forum caught my eyes. you can catch it at this  urlLink  link   .  the forum is simply just a small area inside the news where normal singaporeans can just let out whatever they feel. if its wrong or right or stuffs that should be looked into immediately, its always there. i quote  "  'The Forum in The Straits Times is a good platform for voices which may otherwise remain silent about the little things in life which make us angry, tick or laugh. 'If we start to marginalise the small things and 'small talk', and kill a budding society where people take time to write in to voice their opinions, Ms Lee's wish for more weighty topics will not materialise. 'Do small things not matter? If we can care about small things, small people, we can then go ahead and care about BIG things.'   another portion of the editor's reply really tugged a part of the heart.   and i quote again :  Ms Lee isn't the first reader to write in to express disagreement with the choice of letters published in the Forum. Five months earlier, a reader wrote in to protest against a letter by Mr Paul Armstrong ('Choice Card? Not if he has a choice'; ST, Dec 12) rueing the replacement of the Cold Storage Card with the Choice Card, which would be linked to HSBC's credit cards. To qualify for the new card, one had to first apply to HSBC for its credit card. And to be eligible for the HSBC Gold Card, one had to have an annual income of $30,000. The trouble was, the Armstrongs, who had held a Cold Storage Card since 1959 and had always paid their bills before the due date, were now old and retired, living on their savings and what little interest they earned from their investments. The reader's point was that Mr Armstrong's dilemma concerned only him and was of no interest to others. What he failed to realise was that Singaporeans are ageing fast and Mr Armstrong's predicament would affect more and more people as the clock ticks on. On a happier note, after the letter was published, Cold Storage issued the Armstrongs with a standalone Choice Card   i felt guilty nonetheless. i felt guilty because it is more often than not in doing whetever chores or duties that i have to do every day, i've often forget that my strength wont always be there for me. my parents are old. some day i'll be too.  i really hope tomorrow rains.

      "saya tak mahu sentiasa menunggukan gaji yang akan masuk tiap kali akhir bulan. tiap tiap bulan selalu tertunggu tunggu. dan bila duitnya sudah ada di dalam tangan, kebanyakannya habis dengan membayar  bill bill yang sudah menunggu pula. its a never ending cycle. sampai bila nak jadi begini?" -detik.  after watching that show, it definitely struck a chord within myself. i'm sure i'm not the only one who does this every single month. waiting for the money and spending it all much more on bills and expenses. people say working with the *gahmen* is the most stable job one can ever have. in sunny singapore, most of us wants to work for the *gahmen*. its safe. stable. comforting. finish poly go work with *gahmen*. nevermind that you have to be bonded to them for 5 to 6 years. finish ITE? no prob. work with the *gahmen*. but dun forget to sign on the doted line ah.  its always a cycle. its never ending. people are just so scared of breaking those cycles. too much things we have yet to pay. too much more things that we want to buy. and money is always never enough. sometimes i wonder why our leaders started the term quitters and stayers. must have been based on their own experiences.   how do you actually expect people to stay when there is definitely nothing else to look forward to in here except money and the big houses and those big cars and credit cards....  "pay it forward"  i keep seeing that slogan on tv.  its a good slogan. too bad its in a wrong country. we definitely won't understand even half the meaning of it.

      a cheetah is the fastest moving mammal in the world. the wonder of that animal is the speed that it can achieve while chasing a gazelle on the plains before it can devour that animal for lunch. so whats the beauty of it if its kept in an area all surrounded by wires and gates. nowadays we just simply call that place a zoo.  a calvin and hobbs cartoon really sums up all of the above nicely. quoted hobbs the tiger " if humans were able to keep rainbows in bottles. they would do it."  its never intelligent for humans to play GODS.

      nowadays students can just go to the police, lodges a report againts a teacher simply for reprimanding them for not doing something which they should have done in the first place. of course you'll get scolded for not doing your homeworks. and if u do something worse like play truant smoke or fight, what do you expect teachers to do. just smile and say "boboy/gegerl...next time dont do like this ok? you know its not right kay"??   during my time which was not so long ago, you'll get caned just for speaking against the teacher! not to forget playing soccer in the rain during recess or running away from the nurse. err...sometimes.  its so often that i get to read bloggers who are mostly teachers complaining how miserable their lives are, how cruel life treats them, how i want to find another job, how  i want to get married so fast so i can just make babies and not be a teacher anymore sob sob. misery misery misery. you don't often get those old timers teachers go online and complained about their jobs do you? so whats wrong? are our teachers so plain weak or are the students so plain...powderful?  its a hard life out there when you become a teacher. you're basically waging a war against life, your own life trying so hard to keep yourself sane, against the managament who simply dont understand you, against the parents who simply think that teachers are stoopid good for nothing humans who should actually be like a PC where they can just reprogrammed and press ctrl+alt+del anytime they so wants.  kids nowadays simply don't realised how precious a teacher can be for your own life.   to note: SMU = elite-expensive-school-good-enough-for-those-with-the-money-to-use-as-a-toilet-paper.

      i'm practically straining to see through my slinted puffy eyes while forcing these fingers to dance on the keyboard. the reason? working for 16 hours straight without any sleep in any position whatsoever is the cause of it. and yet tomorrow is another working day for me, a servant of the *gahmen* as what the people in "talkingcock.com" preferssss to describe them. with exams just-a-shouting round the corner, i'm simply left with that little ounce of bite left to carry on this fight. but whose winning? go figure.  the stalker in nisha aziz the movie was caught and punished. seems like it'll be the end of that. or is there? haha.

      it ever reached a point when people at some nook in their career, that they simply just don't care what goes on around their life and ONLY, i repeat ONLY care about their own selfish selves. you ever felt that way before? its getting more tiring working right now and its never about the money. its always about people.  "no man's an island" but it seems everybody nowadays are simply good in making islands among their own bloody selves.  and the only way i always keep myself sane is that one stick of Marlboro thats hanging down my lips. stupid? go figure.

      i was fiddling through the old love letters in my secret stash when i came across this poem a friend wrote.   wahai wanita! keanggunan mu kurniaan ILLAHI petah kata mu bijak bistari keaslian mu membawa cinta murni kehadiran mu sesuci embun pagi walau ayu mu terserlah mencecah pelangi walau harum mu semerbak kasturi walau ilmu mu melangit tinggi wahai wanita! usah menyombong dengan kurnian diberi usah dicalar kelopak maruah mu dengan duniawi akhlak mulia lebih disanjung dikemudian hari kau ibarat sang helang terbang meninggi pabila kelesuan kau hinggap diranting bumi darjat mu tetap dibawah naungan suami tempat berpayung yang setia menanti usah kau lupa firdausi dijanji kecantikan iman lebih diberkati taatlah kepada suami moga tercapai syurga dihajati

       "bungs"  - a term that i would associate with someone who for some reason personal to him or her decides to be merajuk just because he couldnt take a joke. often a shorter word for "bunga" and more often than not only applicable to a GUY.  perempuan kalau merajuk macam normal gitu. its probably in them to feel that way when they got angry or when things don't go the way they wants it to be. tapi kalau lelaki yang merajuk pulak...truthfully speaking memang buruk sekali. well that's what happens to my colleague last night and frankly speaking he's not a young chap. and frankly, macam mana nak pujuk lelaki yang merajuk eh...at times it felt like they are just being childish.   "eh kau ni kan....bungs ah! tak boleh kena sikit. macam pompuan siak"  lelaki merajuk memang buruk. period. tapi kalau lelaki yang dah berumur merajuk...speechless.  anyway i wanna share this one local book that i strongly urge everyone to read. its an oldie but still a goodie. its one of those books that you would constantly read every other day without even getting bored...

      my morning was spent fixated on this piece of news on the  urlLink Berita Harian.   "Singapura - Kadar perceraian di kalangan pasangan Melayu/Islam di sini meningkat sebanyak 27 peratus tahun lalu, berbanding tahun sebelumnya. Malah, jumlah mereka yang bercerai tahun lalu itu mencapai paras tertinggi dalam masa sepuluh tahun. Jumlah perkahwinan di kalangan pengatin baru juga terus merosot dengan usia mempelai yang bernikah untuk kali pertama terus meningkat. Antara sebab utama keretakan rumah tangga, yang lazimnya berlaku dalam lima tahun pertama perkahwinan, ialah perbezaan peribadi, kecurangan, pengabaian, tidak memberi nafkah dan penyalahgunaan dadah. Lebih separuh atau 59 peratus perceraian tahun lalu dituntut oleh pihak isteri."   its a wonderful reading on certain blogs about people who are getting married, who are already married and those who intend to get married. beautiful *peektures* of wedding occasions and colorful dais and pretty people gracing that once in a lifetime ceremony. i've always wondered how much money they've spent just trying to get that picture perfect wedding so that they could remember it for the rest of their eternal lives. often than not, its always the parents money that some are using instead of their hard earned saved wedding cash.  a good advice i got from this book.  urlLink     and so i quote;  Marriage. Almost everyone i knew had some problem with it. Some had problems getting into it, some had problems getting out. My generation seemed to struggle with commitment, as if it were some alligator from some murky swamp. I had gotten used to attending weddings, congratulating the couple, and feeling only mild surprise when i saw the groom a few years later sitting in a restaurant with a younger woman whom he introduced as a friend. "You know, I'm separated from so-and-so..." he would say.   Why do we have such problems? I asked Morrie about this. Having waited seven years before i proposed to Jamie, I wondered if people my age were being more careful thon those before us, or simply more selfish?  "Well i feel sorry for your generation. In this culture its so important to find a loving relationship with someone because so much of the culture does not give you that. But the poor kids today, either they're too selfish to take part in a real loving relationship, or they rush into marriage and then six months later, they get divorced. They don't know what they want in a partner. They dont know who they are themselves - so how can they know who they're marrying?"  "Still there are a few rules i know to be true about love and marriage: If you don't respect the other person, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you don't know how to compromise, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. If you can't talk openly about what goes on between you, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. And if you don't have a common set of values in life, you're gonna have a lot of trouble. Your values must be alike."  And the biggest one of those values?  "Your belief in the importance of your marriage."  -mitch albom from the book "tuesdays with morrie"  its not how nice your wedding day is or how smooth it went for your guests. its the life with her after that day that matters most. i want to believe in that.

      i really have a knack in liking domestic songs from our local bands. somehow rather it seems that our local bands was successful enough in creating songs that was unique and attracting. still remember KICK! and Lovehunters? those were the days man when Perfect 10 ruled my secondary school days and getting a pair of Levis jeans was like a God's given gift from the heaven. those days really was damn slow...  nowadays you hardly get to hear any local band songs on the Perfect 10. kinda sad though...  the roar of thunder was starting to greet us louder each day. and every time i read the news (yes i do enjoy that 10 mins of the day reading my straits times in the kitchen every morning )there's always that bit of news of another *bad* character of us singaporeans. heck, i just saw this piece bit of news on the TV where two grown ladies was seen fighting and jostling and tearing each other's clothings away right on national tv. and the cause of their dismay? cutting queues on the line to let their children ride ponies around the school padang. come on lah people....  ada pepatah melayu berkata...hujan emas di negeri orang, hujan batu dinegeri sendiri. been hearing from a lot of people on the thoughts of migrating. it sounds rather nice wouldnt it? to live simply as slow as you would want in a much nicer environment. everyday of the month, i always go through the same old rituals. setting the deadline to pay my bills. in fact most of my time after my pay day was spent separating my money, deducting whatever that was left and trying extremely hard to save the rest. every single month in every single year that i've started working, i have been doing that.   "kau tak penat? sampai bila..."  sampai bila you want to spend your whole life concentrating on bills bills and even more bills. is that a national hobby for those semi-rich people? or isit just a singaporean past time? when do you exactly find the time to enjoy whatever that you have bought with your hard earned allowance without even thinking of the bills.   i'm trying extremely hard not to get money minded in sunny singapore. trying hard to tell myself what my friend told me years back...  "bila kau mati nanti. kau mati seorang."  i'm past my quarter century point. but i'm already so tired.

      the government is startting a new wave against the fight with cigarettes. and their new arsenal would be gory images of blackened gums, dying babies, families in trouble and lungs that look like that they were barbequed over the pit. and you could distinctly found these images on the cover tops 'cause i've seen them and it does look *yucky* if you intend to display the box on the table top. but would it deter people from smoking?  heck no.  feeling yucky over the images? yes. but stopping from smoking? now dats a different ball game. i guess the only way that someone would stop smoking would be if they themselves had those images within them. if the doctor would show to them the exact condition of their lungs, i guess that would be the only time you'll be totally hell scared.  i would.  scary statitic: there is an increasing percentage of women smokers in singapore. so this is what women equality does to women right? guys mahu mati cepat...perempuan pon nak ikut sama.   peace.

         i was never an avid soccer player. or even a soccer enthusiasts. its usually the occasional soccer thingy at the basketball court or the street soccer court that you'll get to see me huffing and puffing after that small ball. but with the upcoming game later tonight, i may try to rekindle back that interest which died when singapore left the Malaysia cup.   anyway, why would i wanna buy a 70 bucks england jersey for nothing right. COME ON ENGLAND!  ps: i only bought the jersey because it looks nice.  peace. \m/\m/

      its rare that i get to find a poem that sticks to the heartbone. but i apologize if my friend do not agree to the words...   jangan kerana guruh bergempita air di tempayan kaukeringkan, jangan kerana unggas di rimba denak di sangkar kaulepaskan, jangan kerana pelangi yang indah lampu di kamar kau matikan, jangan kerana kerlipan kaca zamrud di tangan kau lemparkan, jangan kerana buih yang indah bumi yang nyata kau tinggalkan...  -abdul rahim awang.(1993)

      i went out for a ride with her again. its only during my off days that we can go out on dates like this. met up with my friend at bt batok before we rode over to bt timah to try out the trail over there. i really need to see whether my *girl* is up to her expectation as before. but even before we could get to the trail, my friend had some problems with the pedals so we then decided to spend about an hour just trying to fix it. looks like my *girl* wont get to taste some mud today. sigh.  anyway while we were enjoying the scenery of cars parking and moving around the car park as we were repairing the bike, i noticed that there were quite a number of monkeys around the area. it looks like a mini zoo down here. its not often that i get to see a real life monkey up close and personal, but my curiosity got the best of me. while chasing after this one small baby monkey, my freinds caught a couple of them engaging in some activities that we humans would prefer to keep it in the bedroom and the toilet. or as some would prefer, the staircase landing of a HDB flat. =)  we decided to go back after that tardy show. seems like that discovery show was too much for us to indulge. sheesh...  "bad monkey! shoo! bad monkey!"

      a south african journalist commented that singapore is filled with souless and money faced people who only cares about their cars, their pursuit of condos, the numbers of credit cards in their wallets and the commas in their bank accounts. i myself find it hard to dispute about that. its a reality fact that most of us here spend too much of our life working too hard for the green bucks. even me. even bloggers that i've read about often too much complain of wanting to run away to sunny australia or other far flunged places just to have a slower pace of life.   i dun deny that there is a lil bit of in me who wants to travel around the world looking for a better place to live in. but everytime i drove back to singapore from malaysia and looking towards those lights at the causeway or seeing the changi airport from the window of the airplane, there's always this feeling of comfortness engulfing myself.   i would never trade that kinda feeling with anything else in the world. even if its filled with souless and money faced people.  =)

      my mum received a call from malaysia late last night. and we received news that my pak ngah (from my mother's side)had died from cancer. so early this morning, quickly called my station to take an urgent leave and drove up to pontian where the latter was staying. since i was not that aufait with the roads in malaysia, i had to thank my uncle for guiding me by driving upfront. after 3 hrs of driving up and down the winding roads of johor, finally reached peradin, pontian safe and sound (phew!)  we were there just in time for my mum to look at his face before they covered him up with the kain kapan. he looked definitely serene as he usually is. his mouth were slightly opened showing his pearly white teeth. it seems like he was grinning at us (mind the pun of coz). sembahyangkan di masjid nearby before he was buried behind the mosque.   it never struck me that much until i noticed that the ones doing most of the work was outsiders and his sons in laws. one of the son was busy looking nice whereas the youngest son was smoking somewhere with his gang. he look so much like a typical drug addict.  but besides all that, i pity his wife who will be staying at the home alone with the youngest son. it would look okay now when there are a lot of people around what with all the grandchildren running about. but when they all will go home soon, i guess the loneliness will sets in somehow.  how do you actually cope with life without that person by your side anymore. how would you actually be able to go to sleep without having that person sleeping by your side. some people will just say, life will still goes on and you have to to be strong. but tell that to a 71 yr old wife who has just lost her husband who has been by her side for the past 50 years. a husband who has gone through thick and thin with her in every situation imaginable in a relationship.  then i think about the increasing divorce rates in singapore, and i wonder...what the hell is wrong with us?  go figure.

      after 3 months of sleeping, finally me and her went our for a ride. dropped by at jurong west to sent some stuffs to my sis-in-law. then rode over to norlin coffeehouse at jurong west for some late night dinner. she was still okay. still reliable for her age and still look gorgeous. after hours of lepaking, my buddies and her then went over to west coast park to see the new Macdonald restaurant which was said to be the biggest in singapore. all the time i was working in the clementi area, this was the first time i saw a Macdonald restaurant just beside west coast park. it was indeed huge by far with both the McCafe and the restaurant together. and whats so nice abt it was it was 24 hrs!. now we have another makan outlet to go at night besides the Mac at King Albert. anyway our intention to go west coast park was to snoop at couples making out but since we came across the new Mac, we decided to snoop that out instead. hur hur.  finally reached home at one. ahhh...the luxury of staying home alone with the air-con at full blast and chocolate ice-cream just beside me.  peace.

       urlLink    angelina jolie  urlLink     its just one of those nights that i just want to see angelina jolie pic on my blog again. hardly ever a girl could attract a guy just from that look on that face. that heck-care-i-dont-give-a-damn-what-you-say face that you could hardly get bored looking at every morning you try to wake up. even without the make up.  i just had my chalet with a few close collegues last few days ago somewhere at pasir ris. had a few drinks here and there, some soccer in the rain, spent most of the time lounging in the pool and the jacuuzi. day dreaming of the day where i could buy a jacuuzi in my future house. have never felt so at ease and so relax with the chalet by the beach, sea breeze running through the rooms and the smell of fire from the barbeque pit nearby.  its very hard for me not to think about the days when maybe ten to twenty years later if i'll still be able to enjoy myself just like on that day. laughing and joking and simply enjoying that very moment with all of my friends without a care in the world. i could have sworn that i must have reduce some of the worry lines on my forehead and maybe some of the white hair on my head. life was crawling in that chalet.  but twenty years later things would've changed. friends would come and go. we'll forget names and maybe faces. i won't be hearing their voices anymore. i dont even know if any of them would still be there with me when its time for me to get old. or when i die.  i really regretted not bring my digicam on that day.

       urlLink    ritchie valens&nbsp; urlLink     every saturday night, somewhere at orchard towers, there's always a scene to enjoy. you can either just sit by the steps, have a drink or a puff and watch the world goes by. or you can follow the caucasians and try to chat up with one of the sisters standing around. or should i say the technical term? loitering around?  its not a fetish for me to enjoy looking at the sisters. so called sisters. its simply a wonder to behold to me to see them behave and dressed in that manner that is simply odd to me. would you not think that since GOD has made you a certain way, why would you want to be in another manner that is just so the opposite? sometimes i may laugh and jeer at them. to disturb them just to get a certain reaction from them. and sometimes i may just keep quiet and just watch them. should we not condemn&nbsp;such actions? isit normal to have most of these sisters from my own community?   such as shakespeare would say if he were still in the era  "if you prick us, do&nbsp;we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die?   but should we also ignore and forget what happen to the kaum dalam zaman Nabi Lut? its simply wrong for any of us to speak in defence of them and ignoring the truth. its simply not right.  anyway it aint fun making too much fun of them. no matter how garang i may be at work or how strict i am with my subordinates. getting chased by those adek adek is no laughing matter boy. seram gila siol! and the manner with which they run, hamkah afik pon boleh kalah. take it from me, i'm simply telling it from my own personal *kena kejar* punya experince.  brr....seram! tobat tak nak kacau adek adek lagi!

      having to enjoy the company of the ringing tone while you're watching the movies is already bad enough, but having to endure the spotlight while that person is sms-ing to another is an added bonus. here you are in the movie theater waiting to watch that movie that you paid for, its a wonder to me why some people can afford to miss &nbsp;most parts&nbsp;of the movie just to answer a phone call or reply to an sms when they can do all that after that movie has ended.  &nbsp; i'd suggest a movie theater where they would give you a pause button specially for you to press just in case you receive any call or any sms. or maybe just stay at home, save that money for some rainy day and wait for that movie to come out on channel 5 or channel i. &nbsp; i give up. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      when i wake up to go to work, i can barely see the sun peeping through the dark clouds. if i'm lucky, i can even feel the heat from the sun as i board the bus. and when i finish my work and start walking back home, i can only see dark clouds following me around. sometimes stars, maybe one or two. it depends.  &nbsp;  its hard for me to ask much nowadays. the money i get month after month don't really feel that much. when you really think about it, it can hardly make you rich in this country. not that i want to be rich. but its just a nice feeling knowing that you have something to dig in that wallet. but how long can you hold on to that dream car? tiredness just slowly seeps in...  &nbsp;  ironically, my needs are so simple. humble delights as one would describe them. a good novel with a nice comfortable chair. rainy nights. a working radio. none of my limbs missing or broken. a good jog. empty libraries. huge book stores. just normal stuffs.  &nbsp;  knowing that everything wouldnt last long. i'm enjoying the ability that my fingers can still type on the keyboard right now.&nbsp; =)  &nbsp;   currently enjoying the book above right now &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i've searched the internet for that elusive korean movie and yet to find one that provides english substitles. and today while walking around the jurong west market with my mum (yes guys do go to the markets with their mums) i've finally found that movie in a secluded small cheena shop that could hardly be described as a VCD shop. so hurrah!  saw a red haired or isit red headed lady taking order from a guy at the hawker centre. tall and white, with blue shorts that cuts to the lower half of the butt, she sports a ponytail which is pink in color. couldnt see the face cause when she turned i was already walking to her other opposite. alas.  note to single guys: the worse place to find an available single girl would be at the market. i have hardly find any cute pretty girls (which are presumed to be single) all around the market. funnily enough the ones that always follow their mums to the market would be the guys (which includes me!). how strange would that be yah?  no wonder we have so many guy-chefs.

      its very hard to produce a very good job well done even though you know your job well but there will always be that one person who puts you down in front of other people. whats even worse is that the other person is your "head" itself. surely he would have known better how good you conduct yourself in the job lest to say some sarcastic comments, questioning your actions as a leader of the team and advising my very own attitude as a leader not to my own self but to other supervisors. you as a supervisor yourself should have come forward to me and give me your own feedback instead of being a "woman" and bitch about it to other people.  anyway bitching is such a degrading word. a bitch is a female dog as all of you might realise hence thats why only they do it. we don't. enuff said. this part bores me with all the constant to n fro bickering over a certain picture. to hell with it.  its coming to 4 years for myself to stay in this room and i'm furiously thinking of starting new and seeing the outside world. maybe walk a bit or drive around. its better than to have a supervisor who likes to *bitch* around yah?

      i love korean movies. i'm a guy yes. but i'm not afraid to admit this fact. yes i adore korean movies. so how many guys that you know of would dare to admit it?  currently i'm enjoying this movie.    crazy marriage - 2002   if that first love don't actually work out. how do you actually try to get over it. i had my first love during my national service. i'm one of those late bloomer guys who don't actually see girls as a personal commodity to be shown off to other people. its more like just another person that i see every other day.   having a girl to me would be just an added burden to myself. financially i knew that its not something that i would look forward to. furthermore most of the girls that i know were still waiting for their A level results. none were able to support me financially. hey i'm never against any girls who are more financially stable than me.   blind dates were a norm. coffee and drinks by the roadside were just me being nice to them. do you know hard it is to talk to someone apart from the normal "hey have you watched that latest movie by so and so and isnt he looks like ya know cool?" or "i mean don't you like linkin park?" its embrasssing for me to admit that i've used that term we all say so affectionately "steady". i guess it does sound cool at that point of time but frankly, truthfully, i've never really sounded a girl steady before. (does that even came out right?)  my first love couldnt work out. so if your first love wouldnt work out, how do you actually go through it normally? let us just know that it didnt work out because i hated choices. and marriage was a bigger choice to me than life itself. marriage is like a whirlwind coming through a town and changing everything upside down. its just a matter of picking up the pieces and try to work everything out or you could try arguing over the matter and start fighting at the pavement and blame each other for what god gave us.   so why do some take the eternal plunge while others simply wait. its never a win win affair. its even harder when you break up and simply wait but at the same time see the other half take the plunge with someone else. you could either smile while seeing her at the wedding or you could just light up that cigarette and close your eyes and try to walk away. and i mean try.  yes i enjoy korean movies. =)

      i have been waiting for season 5 to kick off and personally,  urlLink the amazing race  is one of the most reliable reality base TV shows around. Review for episode 1: size is not a factor when you have to carry a 55-pound side of beef one-half mile to a butcher shop on your shoulder. even a normal size person can choke. maybe even me.    kudos to the midget and her other half wacko cousin. she cracks me up. ha ha ha.  note to myself: spiderman 2 and king arthur after bonus. =)

      i've never liked woody allen. in fact i hated him. for the fact that he married his own step-daughter, he is indeed a good writer. scores of people adores him, and in a funny wierd reason unknown to me, at times i see some sense in what he's trying to convey in his movies.   caught a movie by him just now and i quote:  i remembered a joke. a man sees a doctor about his brother who thinks that he's a chicken. so the doctor then ask him why he never turns his brother in. and he said that he cant. and when the doctor asks why. he replied, "i still need the eggs"  in every sense of the joke, it reflects back on every relationships that we've ever had. relationships are so irrational that its hard to comprehend why two person can be together. why do we often go through a relationship after having to endure breakups after breakups. as what woody allen would say.  "we need the eggs"

      was blog hopping in my weariness when i blog hop to this blogsite and somehow rather than never, the short quirky stories really made me cracked up. often you don't have to write too much, simple can be as sweet as an ice cold cornetto on a humid saturday afternoon. and i quote a story from  urlLink him .   Called some dude last night and he was at the bar. I could hear him loud and clear and he was screaming:  “I CAN’T HEAR YOU. IT’S NOISY IN HERE. CAN YOU SPEAK UP? HELLO? …HELLO? SPEAK LOUDER PLEASE!”   I’m like, you can’t hear me but I can hear you, so why are you shouting, dumbass?! I’ve noticed that many people do that. As if talking louder makes one hear better.

      even though i have failed in trying to catch any of the games on Channel 5 due to me sleeping early even though i have 5 alarm clocks beside me and also due to the fact that soccer bores me at half time. i have indeed promised myself that i will mati mati try to catch the finals tonight which is this morning. Portugal against Greece. i'm rooting for the greeks even though i can barely spelled out their names.  check out the song in the background. been trying to find it for the past 12 years. the year is 1992.  peace.

      right now, my body felt like it could be broken into pieces and be cooked to be made into sup tulang ala carte. something is wrong with my leg joints. i can hear the creaking sounds while swinging it up and down. anlene? for goodness sake i'm only 26! not yet! had my 10km jog in the morning. then went driving up and down jurong west and NTU. finally was back at home by 10.   caught the repeat telecast of Anugerah. discovered that even though you may have teeth jutting out of your lips, by gawd she can really sing! bravo to the lady who sang a blardy good song even though the rest of us are mostly (i'm sure) attracted to those few tooths coming out under her lips. =) and i'm sure most of us are secretly hoping that those tooths would get stuck to the microphone. hur hur hur.  ever had an argument with someone who simply have some way or another are always able to retort back whatever comments that you had for them. that no matter what you can say to them, there is always something that they would find to reply and make everything a whole lot worse than it already was. how irritating can it more be when you know that this blardy argument would go nowhere and the only way to stop it is just to shout  WHATEVERRRRRRR . but its more advisable to shout those words in the middle of the field dead deep at night when the person is no longer there.  sometimes i do wonder why GOD created such irritants.   tiredness is slowly biting into my mind as i crawled to get my degree. but a comic book taught me best how i should think:  sebuah  perjalanan takkan lengkap tanpa berbekalkan secubit perjuangan.  tapi perlu ke berjuang? perlu ke terus berjalan kalau lorong yang bakal kita tempuh tu belum pasti berpenghujungnya?  "kamu belum lalu, macam mana nak dikatakan belum pasti?"  sesuatu yang bakal kita tempuh kamu jadikan perjuangan. dan sesuatu yang kamu telah tempuh, kamu jadikan ia sebagai pedoman sebuah perjalanan.   dan di penghujung jalan perjuangan itu nanti, kamu akan sedar bahawa semua benda yang bersifat baru ada awalan dan akhirannya. "jadi kenapa kamu perlu takut untuk berjalan?"   even a comic book can teach life's lessons.

      currently listening to:   Thinking About You    Been thinking about you, your records are here,  your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there.  But I'm still no-one, and you're now a star,  what do you care?  Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,  shit I still love you, still see you in bed.  But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care  when the other men are far, far better.   All the things you've got,  all the things you need,  who bought you cigarettes, Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?   I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?  These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet.  They don't know what I know and why should you care  when I'm not there.   Been thinking about you, and there's no rest,  should I still love you, still see you in bed.  But I'm playing with myself, what do you care,  when I'm not there.   All the things you've got,  she'll never need,  all the things you've got. I've bled and I bleed to please you.   Been thinking about you.    if you cant understand the meaning of the song, it is intially part of the Manic Hedgehog demo, this touching love song focuses on the experience of being left behind by someone who has achieved fame.   had a bad taste of late supper somewhere at bt gombak. the place was packed to the till with people craving for late night foodies and we barely found a place to sit and have some. the mee goreng that i ordered wasnt what i've used to eat. its when i bought my drinks that i saw that it was a malay guy who cooked it. preferred an indian guy to cook my mee goreng. must have missed that special ingredient thats only found in a mamak sweat. hur hur hur.  sometimes i wonder why people are scared of cats. its just a thought. not a question.   i've yet to sleep since i'm having my cross country tomorrow. its kinda wierd to call it cross country when the run is somewhere at marina bay and there is barely any countryside found anywhere near that place. apart from the thorny esplanade which is gathering dust with every month. maybe they should call the run more like "a run through a lovers corner" hur hur hur  maybe i should call it a day and go to sleep

      i'm bored.  its past 2pm right now and i have no idea what else to do for the day. besides work there is. lepas solat, check on the food my sis cook. looks wierd. maybe i'll skip lunch today and have dinner at work. looks at my mountain bike at the corner, but the weather is so damn hot right now, i don't feel like i should be getting sun burned yet. would probably go to work early for my daily jog before i start work, but my legs kinda feel so tired. furthermore my shoes are being borrowed by my brother for his IPPT. and if i do bring my shoes to work, my colleagues would probably forced me to play soccer tommorrow morning after work and the fact is, i'm just not in the mood to play competitive soccer. and they forced me to play goalkeeper! just because nobody wants to play goalkeeper, so everybody turns to me, the kaki-bangku of the team.  i'm probably bored because financially, i'm spending way too much money this month. bonus is getting in this month, but i just felt that i've spent way too much money. and its getting on my nerves because i should know better that in august i have to pay for my uni fees and its costing me abt $4k. where in the hell am i going to get that amount of money so soon? i'm thinking of paying it in installments but i've yet to go down to the school admin to talk to them about it.   everybody's been asking me for money. and everywhere i go i have to pay money. i'm yet to pay for my car summons and i'm still thinking how i'm going to last until the 10th with only 50 bucks. everybody thinks that just because my rank is higher than the previous year so i must be rich? never hear of the term "besar periuk besarlah keraknya"? and i have this one colleague who keeps asking for cigarettes from me and even though he's still in national service, come on lah, takder rasa malu ke asyik nak mintak ajer. there's always a limit to kindness and unlike some people who can be kind to everybody at all times, my limit is only until my knee point. why should i be nice to other people when i'm going to suffer myself? maybe its time that i stay more at home and just switched off the h/phone cause the bills are gnawing too much into my bank account. damn you Shingtell!  i cant wait for my Playstation 2. before anyone accuses me of spending too much for that game console, kindly take notice that i've been saving to buy that for the past 6 months.   and yet i'm still bored. maybe its time i switched on the TV and forced myself to bite into my sis cooking even though i know its detrimental to my health. the things you do just to please ur family...sigh.

      we had a case where a girl tried to commit suicide by jumping off from a 6th floor hdb flat. but as luck would have it, a tree down below and the muddy floor saved her 15 year old life. with only some broken hipbones and a slight dislocation of the shoulder, she should thank God that she's still alive. some would gather the reasons that a 15 year old girl would try to kill herself due to some boyfriend problems or maybe plain stress. but i'd doubt if you'd believe me if i did tell you the real reason over that jumping escapade. so why would a young 15 year old girl decide to end her life by jumping out of a 6th storey floor?   the answer? her hamster died.   the stuffs people do just to get over death in the family. sigh.

       "there will always be that one moment in time when words can be so useless."    think  a kid ask me why we tend to think faster than we speak. its probably because GOD wanted us to think twice before we intend on saying something not stupid to others so that we won't regret in the near future. but why do you need to think when your utmost actions often betrays your very attitude.   bodoh sombong  if you for once think that at some point in time, you have been stupid, you're even more stupider if at most of the time you refuse to accept that maybe you have been stupid and refused to change. when you've reached rock bottom, the only way is to go UP. but if you start to cry and start to dwell on your stupid misfortune, then to hell with you. its obvious you have refuse to understand the very reason why GOD gave you hands and legs and a brain to think.   time  there's only 24 hrs in a day. only 24 hrs. if you cant even try to spend a minute of the day telling someone how you care for him or her, and started blaming for excuses that you have created for yourself, then you've obviously been living in your own world and creating your own time. might as well you start living in your own island.

      many a times when i'm walking somewhere around somewhere, there'd always be that one chance or point of time where someone will call out my name out of nowhere and i would have no idea who that person was. we would talk of old times and out of courtesy, i'd try to joined in the conversation as much as i could while my head was spinning around trying to find a name from that face. it would always be someone from my primary school days who GOD knows  i no longer remember any of their names or it would be someone from my sec sch or even worse from my god forsaken JC days. my last resort would be by saying "hey why don't you gimme your number and we could meet up one of these days and have coffee? so how do i spell your name? he he. its very embarassing to myself when there are some people who remembers my name so vividly and yet i couldnt even recall their first names. sigh. yet today while walking somewhere around the campus, again another soul calls out my name and start smiling back at me. all that i could do was smiled back at him, give a lil wave and start moving my mouth saying "sorry my class is starting" its only now that i remember that he was someone from my own station. *sigh* i think he was some chinese guy in my workplace. or is he malay? sigh...entahlah.  one day i'll try to upload all the pictures of the people i know plus their names and implant them to my brain. :)

      i used to love going to the zoo. during my time, given the opportunity to see another form of GOD's creation in their own special habitats is a chance to wonder and be amaze on their behaviour. even the preparation itself to go for a visit is an event by itself. SCV dont even exist during those days. and the fees to go to such places was excruciatingly and painfully high, its always one of those special months of the year that you'll get a chance to visit the animals. but as time passes, i now loathe going there. SCV had arrived and within reach around the corner of my room. its really hard not to ignore how miserable the animals would feel having be cooped up in those specially made cages so that us humans could ogle at them. its an agony for me to go there now.  if humans were able to able to keep rainbows in bottles. i believe they'd do it. we are just that cruel. think about it.

       urlLink    rawk chick compliments to  urlLink gum .  urlLink     a fren was chided for being short and fat. "ketot and gemuk" unlike when he was in sec sch the last 5 years where he was not that short nor was he any taller than he was right now. shortness might be in the genes within the family but fat? might be due to his own fault. we had a few laughs. joke a bit more. he wasnt taking it too sensitively but simply joined in the conversation. 5 years of friendship could probably be the reason for it.  its easy to ignore how harmful those words could be. we humans so easily succumb to the very essence of making fun of others. might not be due to their fault, could be due to their fashion sense, style, behaviour. in fact there are so many words that could be found in the malay dictionary. gemuk. ketot. bopeng? bodoh. selenger. rambut macam wire. macam badak. bongok. bengal. bau kaki. i've never been spared before. so many times i've been called cicak kobeng. even from someone close to me. :)  those may be words. but the problem is that, there are only words. words that can be easily used and manipulated and unconsciously, may not mean much to the person spewing those darn words. would hurt a lot to the other party. but how would you know if the other party would only smile and even joke back at you.  when my ketot guy friend replied to the sarcastic remarks, he says that he just wish GOD could forgive you for making fun of GOD's creation. to some extent that's true. we could go on in life accepting that since this is GOD's creation, we should endure and accept it? but how often can you defend yourself by saying that whatever shortcomings that is found in you is often due to GOD's creation. if some others keep telling to your face how stupid you are, are you gonna say that its due to GOD's creation thats causing your stupidity?  would it not be disgraceful to say that since GOD gave you a brain, you're simply not using it to do something about what others are saying about you?  i may be cicak kobeng, but hey i'm trying like hell to get fatter. and i'm making the utmost effort to make sure that i do something about it. :)  peace.

       urlLink    rawk chick  urlLink     its hard to ignore how strong this picture above represents. i'm sorry. its stuck in my mind. :)  ohana. ohana means family. and family means nobody gets left behind. today while on duty somewhere at kallang, i'm taught by the very meaning of not leaving anyone behind. as a supervisor, and as a leader to my own men, i have made a terrible mistake. some of my men were left behind in our haste to leave that place and to me, even though they are okay about it, would mean that i have failed in my duty. its not something that i pride for getting back early, but the fact that i have not accounted for some of my men shows how lacking i am in the *not leaving anyone behind* sector. even in the army, when you go on a mission, its always a first priority not to leave anyone of your men behind.  i vow not to make that mistake again. not only in my working duty, but also in my family. ohana.
