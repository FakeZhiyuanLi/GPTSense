       I woke up 6:43 AM...woke up by my cellphone in the alarm "Hey Ya". My mom will leave the house...she'll stay on Cebu for their reunion! Cebu? Yes. Im not ashamed if my mother is a Visayan. Anyway... I'm not one...I'm a bulakenyo!!   So I ate my breakfast... fresh scrambled eggs... honey glazed ham (glad there still is ham on the market!)...fried rice w/ corn cooked on butter and carrots + greenpeas. (hmmm...our housemaid sure cooks good!). Then...I took a shower...a cool shower. I dressed up in my black accel shirt w/ a hood and got ready to go to the airport with our car.  I'll miss my mom!   ~~~~~  We got home ... gosh it is hot... my black shirt w/ hood fits rainy seasons! Not summer.  We had our lunch... Sinigang sa Baka...and grilled porkchops. And cool mango shake.  ~~~~~  After lunch...went to the computer shop...scanned the ragnaboards...yey...a link to GM-Yukino's blog. I entered the chatroom...and met him. He's such a kind guy! ^_^  I viewed his links...saw Chaos' blog! And saw the link to blogger.com. Nice! I saved the link... played ragnarok! I pity my thief who lost his poring hat in a scam...   Later... I got tired playing...so I went to change my avatar! Now a thief avatar! I made my Laibcoms account... then placed a Goblin avatar. I visited our yahoo goup...  groups.yahoo.com/ragnaboarders !!!! join if you are a ragnaboarder in pRO 's ragnaboards.  Ill be inviting GM's to that group...hope they join...  I checked out thius link...made my blog...made my 1st posts...and now working on this... ugh...i have not eaten my supper yet!! (i remember those NSPC Days...sometimes I dont eat lunch cause they are the foods that I hate! Hi gcel & russel & t.ann!! hi fhelanie,trixie, junibel, jovytte, jelly!!! It is cHukE hir!)   ~~~~thanks for reading!
