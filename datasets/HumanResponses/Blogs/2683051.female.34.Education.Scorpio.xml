						    I'll say it. I'm not afraid. The new Stephenson sucks ass     Review by Jake   I guess its not the *new* Stephenson since the second book of the ass-trilogy just came out. I am talking about  Quicksilver . A pretentious, plodding pile of crap if there ever was one.  You know how everyone you know (or at least, who I know) has a copy of  Ulysses  on his shelf, next to that overblown Dan Brown novel and that copy of that Maya Angelou book from college? Its not that its been read, its just a cultural icon that says, I went to college and I like smart things. Nevermind that its unreadable gobbledy gook and that even *if* you slogged through it, you certainly didn't enjoy it. If you did read it, you did so for the same reason that you eat all your greens and tried Yoga--because the less fun it is, the better it is for you. Now I would argue that books like that are the ones that send smart people to be business majors.  Now I should preface this review (even more) by saying that I adore Neal Stephenson. Love him. He definitely makes the list of older dudes that make me giggly. Read  Snow Crash  and fell in love. Read all the early (and not so good) novels about eco-terrorists and midwest colleges. Liked them too. Gave him to my mom to read. Quote his lines to my geek pals. You get the picture.   Cryptomonicon  came along and I was still smitten. A little lengthy perhaps--but we still had that spark together.   Quicksilver  was the prom date that yaks up wine coolers in the car on the way to the dance. I bullied myself into reading the first 200 pages telling myself that there was going to be this magic turn around point--this hook that would get me through all the educational crap that he made me learn about science and math geeks. And NOT A GODDAMN thing appeared.  Neal is a smart dude and I am sure that had I read the whole thing and the following two books, I would be a better person. A person who does Yoga. But I'm not. I want a book that keeps me up past 9pm on school nights. So read the series if you want to be able to throw names like Leibniz into your party banter, I am sure you will be the better man for it.  I'll be in the corner rereading  Neuromancer .   Bibliovore says it tastes like  organic, wheat-free, sprouted bread or wheat grass juice. It's good for you and you get the moral high ground but it still tastes like shit.

						   Tim Powers,  Declare   The biggest surprises of this book, for me, came after the end of the novel. The first was that many of the characters in the book are based on real people. Not being a spy novel kind of gal, I didn’t know who Kim Philby was nor why I should care. Not knowing didn’t hurt my enjoyment of the novel at all but I was amazed to find out that Powers used every scrap of truth about the real characters that he could dig up. He then built the supernatural pieces to fit into the “real” events.   [The second surprise was that  urlLink Tim Powers  looks nothing like I expected him.]  If you haven’t read any Tim Powers yet then run out and buy  Last Call . So far,  Last Call  is the best and I’ve been slightly disappointed by the others but that hasn’t stopped me from working through the canon. 4 down 7 to go. (I’ve read  Last Call ,  The Drawing of the Dark ,  Anubis Gates ,  Declare ) For all you RPGers out there – Tim Powers is to literature as Unknown Armies is to RPGs. If you liked Neil Gaiman’s  American Gods  or  Neverwhere  then you’ll like Powers. Same kind of unassuming regular Joe heroes getting caught up in un-, sub- or supernatural forces, saving the day and getting the girl in the end. I like that I can depend on Powers not to get too Lovecraftian.   Declare  is lots of fun. Just as well researched as  The Davinci Code  without being as pedantic. Better plot twists. Reminded me a little of  The Eight  (Katherine Neville) only far far better written. OK don’t read  The Eight  it’s not nearly as good as it should be even though it’s all about chess which is cool.   Bibliovore  says it tastes like: The kind of candy you tell your mother is really nutritious. Like peanut brittle – peanuts have lots of protein and that good kind of fat you’re supposed to eat. Or a Tiger’s Milk Bar – remember those? Sugar, peanut butter and vitamins, mmmm. I could always talk my mother into one of those.

						   Greetings. I hereby succumb to the blog pressure.  I promise to keep the navel gazing and politics to a minimum.    What I learned in college was how to compare and contrast 2 novels in 7 pages. I was pretty damn good at it too. I learned pretty quickly, however, that corporations do not need novels compared or contrasted - not even in bullet point format. Corporations, on the other hand, pay pretty well.  This blog is my opportunity to once again write about the books I read. This time I get to pick the books. Hopefully, I will be able to twist my friends' arms for some reviews as well.   I promise to keep the pretentiousness factor down. I promise to write about a wide variety of books.

						    Margaret Atwood's  The Robber Bride  kicked my Ass   Review by Nina   My essay on Margaret Atwood's  The Robber Bride  has been holding up this blog for weeks. I've actually read at least 4 other books in the meantime. I just feel that I have to get this one out of my system first before I can tell you about the others.   The Robber Bride  is about women's relationships with other women, the landscape of women's thoughts and the failure to be emotionally honest with ourselves and others. I have no idea what it would be like for a man reading the book. I imagine it something like  visiting a foreign land and finding a few things familiar but out of context.   Three women, friends because they have all been betrayed by the same woman, encounter their nemesis again after they think they have buried her. Read the plot outline  urlLink here . Several of those reviews refer to the book as satirical but I've completely missed the joke.   The villainess Zenia is a psychic vampire; she exploits every weakness, sucks everything from the characters' lives that she can (money, men, self-confidence) but she must be invited in. She cannot cross their threshold against their will. Through most of the book the women are much more focused on saving and protecting their men from Zenia than they are in saving themselves. They think that Zenia is out to get their men but Zenia is out to get them. They persist in thinking that men are fragile, easily broken and unable to understand the truth (each women's truth, of course, we all have our own truth).  The three women are all broken in different ways, they have had traumatic childhoods and absent parents. They are easily exploitable. To kill Zenia they must both reject her seduction and internalize some of her hardness, her cruelty. Because she exploits their naivete they must give it up for good to rid themselves of her. This hardening--for which they are sadly grateful at the end--is not about loving less but about solidifying who they are in relationship to other people. You may disagree but I thought the ending was hopeful. In the aftermath of the final encounter with Zenia each woman takes a step closer to a more honest relationship with her partner or child.  I'd like to believe that if only these women could have seen a good therapist there wouldn't have been so much trauma. I'd like to chalk it up to generational differences. I'd like to believe that women these days take more personal power. That we're more honest about our motives and feelings. Don't see men as some strange delicate creature to be protected and "saved." I read the whole book thinking that I would never be taken in by a Zenia. That I would never invite her in  - that I'm too grounded in my own identity to be convinced by her lies. And now that I'm done with the book I'm not so sure.  Which brings me to the title. In the middle of the book, Roz goes into her basement and finds the fairy tales she used to read to her girls when they were little. She recalls one phase the girls went through in which they insisted that all of the characters were female. So anyone who read them a story had to read it with all feminine pronouns. One of the other characters, Tony, changes the story she reads them to the Robber Bride instead of  urlLink The Robber Bridegroom .  When Roz asks the girls why, they just look at her as if to say, "you know." The story of The Robber Bridegroom is one of those un-Disneyable Grimm stories filled with hacked body parts. If you read the story with all feminine pronouns you could read all the characters as different women.  While it's easy to see Zenia as the Robber and the other characters as first the victim and then the bride, it's not so clear which character in Atwood's book represents the old woman. I don't think that's the point, however, of replacing all the pronouns. I think that if you read the story with all feminine pronouns then it could also be about one woman.  When the bride-to-be in the fairy tale tells the story of her discovery of the evil nature of her robber bridegroom she starts by saying, "Darling it was only a dream." One technique of analyzing your dreams is to assume that all people in the dream are you. If all of the "shes" are the same woman then each woman is robber, victim, brave bride and rescuing crone. Roz, Charis and Tony's journey is paradoxically both to solidify their identities (by which I mean become more honest about who they are to themselves and in relationship to others) and to learn how they encompass the landscape of woman--villain and hero, virgin and crone. "And this weak and idle theme, no more yielding but a  urlLink dream ..." means that inasmuch as I believe I am the brave bride who exposes and banishes evil I must also admit my capacity to be both the victim and the robber.   Bibliovore  says it tastes like a rare filet mignon, complex and primal at the same time.

						   But they *look* so sweet on that bicycle Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer  If I keep reviewing these nonfiction titles, people are going to start to assume that I am *that* kind of person.  People who want to learn things.  So let's be clear, I don't really want to learn things.  I know some things already and I'm not convinced they are doing me much good.  Plus, to quote Homer Simpson,"My brain is full. When I learn stuff, it pushes old stuff out.  Like when I learned to make wine and forgot how to drive."  But I like Jon Krakauer.  I liked his book about why I don't mountain climb.  I think I liked the one about nature, but I don't remember it very well.  I grabbed this at my local bookstore (Costco) and gave it a try.  I figure if someone smarter than me compared it to In Cold Blood and Executioners Song, it must be pretty sweet. Actually before I get to the Krakauer book, you should know that I read Executioner's Song because I had never read any Mailer and it was the one that I thought was his seminal book.  So there I am, reading (skimming) this huge ass book and about 40% of the way through it, something seemed funny.  It didn't read like other fiction novels, but it was too ridiculous to be true.  And then I found out that it was true.  And that this dude that I thought seemed a wee bit two dimensional, was, in fact, a dude that killed people and wanted to be put before a firing squad in Utah.  It made the book seem a little creepy.  Good, but creepy.  But speaking of Utah.  This book is about the murder of a mother and daughter by her brother-in-laws.  But its really about religious fundamentalism and Mormonism.  The book talks a lot about the roots of the fastest growing religion (over 10 million worldwide) that came from the western frontier 150 years ago.  Its hard to remember that Mormonism has only been around since right before the civil war and therefore the history of its beginnings are a lot more accessible than say, the historical documents at the start of Christianity.  I feel a little sorry for the Mormons, their history is a little less murky than say, Judaism, and the leaders of the LDS church haven't done the *best* job spinning their own history to sound like Noah's arc or Moses and that bush.  All of the fallacies and poor impulse control of Joseph Smith and Bringham Young are right out there for you to examine.   While Krakauer clearly is trying to challenge the Mormon authority and its seemingly blind adoration of its founding fathers,  he makes a decent attempt to say that no organized religion is without its Inquisition, or Crusades or witch burnings.    What makes this book so cool is that Krakauer makes it fun.  He spins a tale and leaves out all that crap you don't care about.  His writing is suspensful and succinct.  He writes like he is telling you a cool story in a pub while some stupid ass baseball game is on.  Its great stuff.  All history should be like this.  He isn't really telling you the story about some famous people, he is telling you a story about someone that made decisions that have had huge repercussions.  And its clear that dude could be you.  Its a book about people searching for something they are missing in their lives.  And it doesn't matter if it was in the frontier or if it was last Tuesday.  And he's great at it.  So check it out.  I promise I will stop reviewing history books and get back to all the Oprah Book Club stuff y'all been waiting for.  Bibliovore says:  Its like getting a box of Sees's chocolates that is filled with scotch-mellos.  You were pleased enough to get the box and now you just have to control yourself from getting a little overfull.

						    More reading for the tanning booth  Things My Girlfriend and I Have Argued About  by Mil Millington   Since we are on a mode of light summer reading, I thought this might be a nice little niblet to offer people to get them through the bleakness of July.  This title may seem familiar to those of you that have seen his website of the same name (I know that you all want me to post that site as a link--but you can google as well as I can, you lazy bastards) in which he lists all of the arguments that he and his partner have had over the minutiae of cohabitation.    This book takes that theme (obviously) and gives it a plot.  Pel and his girlfriend Ursula ( take a moment to figure out who has the worst name)  live in England with their two young sons and spend a large amount of time getting on each other's nerves.  This is that point where I am supposed to summarize the plot so you can all get a sense of what happened as I make my point about global themes and gender issues, but I hate summarizing, so I am going to directly what I liked and didn't like about the book.  Millington has that great dry British humor that seems like its self-deprecating when its actually indicating that everyone else is an idiot. That is one of the strongest parts of the novel.  He has good comic timing and a great way with dialogue that makes the real point of the book, (the couple's incessant fighting), well, funny.  In the beginning of the novel, I was a little uncomfortable about the bickering.  Ursula (yes, she has the worst name) comes across horribly and you feel bad for Pel, who comes across like this browbeaten little man who's just trying to do the right thing.  And then slowly, you realize he's an idiot too.  You realize that they deserve each other in the truest sense of it all and finally, you realize that there constant arguing is really very sweet and that they really care about each other.  In some ways, that's exactly why I liked this novel so much better than  The Corrections  by Franzen.  They had horrible relationships and you didn't feel sorry for them, you just felt bad that you had to know what it was about.  TMG&IHAA is fun because there is something sweet about the feelings behind all the screaming.  Another thing I really liked about TMG&IHAA is that Ursula is German and Pel is British and there are many fights about the differences between Germany and England.  Though they live in England, there is this underlying sense that bad things only happen in England and Pel seems to only have patriotic feelings for England out of guilt and a strong sense that Ursula can't  win.  It had not occurred to me that people within Europe talk smack about one another with the same ferocity as the rest of us and they have stereotypes that never occurred to me.  How foolish of me not to think that there would be strife between people who all look the same (ie-white).  Go figure.  My complaint about the novel is that the plot has a certain "Three's Company" quality that a dose of honesty would fix.  I would have liked for Millington to have gone for a plot that is a little more realistic than the category "wacky hijinks".  But its his first time out the gate and I am going to cut him some slack.     Bibliovore says:  Its like kettlekorn--yummy, but it won't be such a bad thing when it goes out of style.

						    If I Went to the Beach I Would Have Read This  Stern Men  by Elizabeth Gilbert   Finally, I get to read something light and fun. Stern Men is set in the insular and inbred world of Maine Lobstermen. Not just any old lobstermen but feuding island loberstermen from 20 miles off the coast of Maine. The protagonist is 18 year-old Ruth and she's a kick in pants. She's better than spunky, she's a foul-mouthed pain in the ass who desperately tries never to do what anyone tells her to. You get a great feel for the island life and the smell of fish guts. Between the alcoholics, inbred idiots, manipulative upperclass, cheating spouses, misanthropes and letches--every character is about equally sympathetic. I vastly enjoyed not caring all that much about the characters but rooting for them all the same. And of course Gilbert ties everything up in a neat happy ending. Who wouldn't want to know all about the history of the first through fourth lobster wars?   Bibliovore says:  It tastes like lobstah of course!

						    Games in the Final Frontier     The Player of Games  by Iain Banks   Utopia meets empire. In the future there will be no war, famine or sickness. We'll live hundreds of years, regrow our own body parts and secrete all the drugs we want with special glands. We'll have nothing to do all day but play games and have sex but mostly play games. Oh yeah and machines will all be sentient. So begins The Player of Games. The book was entertaining while I was reading it but the after-taste is getting worse. For one thing, at the very end it decides to be a Novel of Ideas (capital N, capital I) but it should have stuck to being a good story. I can't decide if the moral of the story is 'oppressing people overtly is wrong but manipulating them to achieve your ends is right' or maybe 'playing to win is good for everyone even if you turn out to be a pawn in someone else's game.'  Instead of bothering, just go out and read   urlLink Ender's Game   instead. If you missed Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game when you were 15, it's not too late to read it now. It's a far better take on the game-as-war theme. I have to warn you not to get too excited and read the rest of the series. The quality drops dramatically after book 1 and book 4 was almost unbearable.   From the guilty pleasure department. If you really like sci-fi/fantasy about games then I do recommend Piers Anthony's  urlLink  Split Infinity  . It's got plenty of nudity and games and talking robots and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than entertainment. The first 3 books are pretty good but only the first one goes into any detail about the game culture.   Bibliovore says:  it tastes like eating a whole plate of fried cheese appetizers--good, greasy and salty going down but now you don't feel so good. I can't believe I ate the whole thing...

						     Stones for Ibarra  by Harriet Doerr  Review by Nina  You should read this book even if it's not really your kind of thing. A couple, one just over 40 and the other just under, move from the Bay Area to rural Mexico to start up the husband's old family mine. The book feels more like a collection of short stories than a novel. The language is lyrical without being gushing and Jake will be happy to know that Doerr never dips into magical realism. There might be odd coincidences and an oddly humorous but sad bit in which an old priest is followed around by all the village dogs all the time, but there are no miracles.  This isn't a travel book, nor is it some of that "see how poverty makes people noble" crap. Mostly it's about the wife's journey to both understand and deliberately misunderstand the people around her and the events in her life.  It's sad but not that bleak. More on the "relentless tide of fate" side than the "all doom all the time" side. I take great solace in the fact that this was Doerr's first book published and she was 68. That means I have about 34 more years before it's too late for me to publish my great American novel.   Bibliovore says:  it tastes like Chicken  urlLink mole  from  urlLink Montero's Cafe.  Chiles with chocolate means it's rich but not sweet.

						    Tipping Point—Malcolm Gladwell  Review by Jake  I think one of the reasons that I have been reticent to write reviews is that I hate summarizing.  It reminds me too much of those horrible book reports that we did in middle school.  It makes me feel like I need to take notes while I read so that I can provide fluid commentary.  Bah!  I have decided to forego  any reasonable summary and simply tell you why I thought it was cool and if that doesn’t work for you—well….I don’t care really.  I thought this book was totally cool.  Now typically, I struggle with non-fiction because it requires more thought than I want to give books.  It makes me read every sentence when I really want to skim and so I get frustrated when I have to slowdown.  But this book does a great job feeding all the interests I have.   I’m sure that, in some ways, it’s supposed to be about economics and marketing, and maybe it is.   But I don’t care about that stuff, so I’m focusing on the bits I liked.  This book talked a lot about the kind of people that make stuff happen.  Gladwell believes that ideas and trends spread because there are key people that spread it to large numbers of people.  He believes that these key people are charismatic (for a variety of reasons) and these small numbers of people set the stage for the whole market.  And I think he is dead right—it seems so smart to me that these special people turn the tide for the whole market.  Think about it—do you know someone that seems to know everyone?  That when you make a diagram of all the people you know, there are one or two people that link all your different social groups together?    The other smart thing he goes in depth about is the size of functioning groups.  His claim is that any group larger than 150 becomes less effective in a number of areas.  He talks about this in depth by looking at all different types of groups.  I was a little suspicious of this but by the end I bought his line of reasoning and wonder why we often educate our children in huge schools.  So check it out and see if it makes sense to you.  Find the Maven and the Connector in your social group.  Its good, clean fun.   Bibliovore says:   Its like one of those huge taco salads, you keep digging in and finding new, good fatty bits.  Mmmmmhhhmmm guacamole...

      I am the den of slack. Instead of say, working or talking to my child, I am blogging. The child, for the record, slept with a ski cap on because he thinks its cool. Who sleeps in a ski cap when the house is 73 degrees?  He lost a tooth yesterday and so I got to play the age old, sneak while he is asleep and deposit 2 Sacagawea dollars under the pillow. You think this is easy?  It's not.  The little turd is desperate to catch me in the act (not because he actually believes in the fairy, but thinks that it would be cool to *see* me do it). So I have to creep in and try and determine if he is awake and faking it. The big tell is to see if he is snorting. Gryphon harrumphs in his sleep all the time. No comic snoring that you see on Cartoon Network. Oh no. Deep arrhythmic grunts like he stepped in gum or a girl touched him on the playground.  So I stand there. Freezing my ass off at 5am, trying to worm two bucks under the pillow and feel for the pee sized tooth. Thank God I told him that the Fairy thinks its gross to touch the actual tooth and wants a carrying case, like a sandwich bag.  He bought it.  I feel like Indiana Jones. Replacing the golden monkey with a bag of sand.  I reach in while he shifts and throws a leg into the air. I wait. Make sure that he is settled and weasel my hand under the pillow. Grab the bag, deposit the money and bolt back to bed.  I can't believe I am going to have to do this 32 more times.

      Went to breakfast (corn beef hash and poached eggs), with my kick-ass sweetie,  Jamie, yesterday morning and there was a couple with a very young infant to our right.  The mom had a little Betty Page haircut and cuffed jeans.  You could tell that she might leave the house without makeup, but never without lipstick.  A signature stripe of red that declares a certain rockabilly aesthetic.  The dad (I am assuming) was a big dude with tattoos (full sleeves no less) and band t-shirt on.  He had a shaved head and two pierced ears.     In my mind, there is nothing cuter than alterno-people having alterno-babies.  I think that this is because, when you have kids, there is this pull to normalcy.  There is this underlying notion that you put away your childish toys and embrace the mid-western values that supposedly come with having a little one.  Now--of course this is total bullshit, right?  You can be an awesome parent with blue hair and there are a lot of crappy moms with capri khakis and a pair of clogs.    I always come back to this awesome young girl, maybe 8 or 9, hair up on her head in two buns secured with wooden sticks; green sweater, pink pants & little doc martins, walking next to her mom, eating chow mein with chopsticks and talking about some friend that was having trouble with math.  Her mom had a blue stripe down the middle of her hair and a stuffed messenger bag and was nodding sagely about the difficulty with fractions.    You just don't see that in Danville. Or at least, I don't think you do.    I like the idea that urban kids go into the world realizing there are many paths.  I hope they enjoy the one less traveled.  On a more personal front, Jamie and I have decided to go back on hormones in another attempt to conceive.  We have decided to step up the intensity to a level where Jamie is giving me shots regularly.  Ugh.

       urlLink "Somewhere in the ancient, mystic trinity, You get three as a magic number."  I was driving east to work this morning as the sun was rising and listening to School House Rock's "3, its a magic number" and just cried with the beauty of it all.  Now, I  am  running a little emotional today and its true that I had not really finished my first cup of coffee; but for a moment, it all came together.  Gears clicked into place and I had the right music, with the right skyline, and a nice strong cup of coffee at the right time.  So, as I drove through the tunnel to work, all was right with the world.    And I started thinking about Music.  Now, I am no music guru.  I kind of follow the logic of my friend  urlLink Jonathan , who believes that you can only invest so much time in any one habit and music didn't make the cut.  I feel that I can only really fully invest myself in books and so I depend on others to cull good music and send it my way.  But in my small way, I think that music is the soundtrack to the view out my windshield and that certain music needs to be matched with the right view.  I can't listen to Pink Floyd in the daytime or bubbly 80s pop at night.  Am I the only one that cares about this sort of thing? There are bands that can transition a bit better.  I can listen to old Peter Gabriel at night and new Peter Gabriel during the day.  I like the idea of music that soundtracks parts of your life.  I think that others, like my friend Rychard, would argue that music stands alone and should be appreciated in its own right.  He also argues that lyrics destroyed popular rock.  He is more of a purist than I.    I wish that you could have a series of CDs that you could plug into those days that you need a kickstart.    I wish you could buy "Just came out of a three hour meeting to sit in traffic for 45 minutes because some ass-clown can't merge".    Until then, I hope I get more mornings of magical numbers and pink skies.

      Spent the weekend away, in the snow, sitting the ass of various couches (as an aside, there is nothing funnier than watching your 100+ pd. dog sink in a snowbank) and had a conversation with my friend Heather that made me think.  We were talking about how people tend to tell me all their weird sexual issues/concerns/predilections/etc.  Heather's comment was that people just *tell* me things, as though I have some secret power that compels people to tell me about their fascination with women's panties.  When I asked why, she was unsure.  I guess that, on some level, there is some truth in her statement.  But I think that has a lot more to do with my interest in sex than it is in my secret Freudian skills.  What I think I communicate to people in some way is that I am pretty much non-judgemental about sex.  As long as you are consensual, then the sky's the limit.  Think it feels sexy to play roles?  Fist?  Have group sex? Fuck in a bar bathroom? Fuck on the bar?  Great!  I want to know all the fun details.    And maybe that is part of why I am fascinated with sex.  I love that people can engage in an act that can bring them so much enjoyment and that their pleasure is so individualized.  One man's golden shower is another lady's spanking.  I love that people change around sex to meet so many different needs.  It is comforting, dangerous, intimate, powerful and gets a lot of people through their crappy, mind-numbing lives.   And that isn't to say that I think loving sex means that I love having it all the time.  I certainly go through periods where my gears can't seem to mesh right.  I can't get where I need to be to give myself up to sex.  But I still remain fascinated by it.  As I get older, I am far more facsinated by the power of sex and the dance people do to get there.  When people talk to me about their sex lives, I love hearing about the "point A to point B" component.  "So you were at the bar and did you just get in his car or did he flat out ask you to come home with him?"   "Did she just pull you into the women's restroom to hump in the handicapped stall?" "Did she call you back afterwards?"   "Who had the dildo?"   That kind of stuff.  And its *all* interesting.  Even the stories from people who have humped their monogamous partner for 20 years.  How do they enjoy it?  How has it changed?    I guess the take home message from this pro-sex post is that life is pretty dull.  Having judgements about how people have sex just makes your world smaller.  I think that everyone should dig deep into the world around them and see how it ticks.  It certainly makes my day better.

      So I read.  A lot. And this year (more than other years for some reason) I have been pissed off that I have to work so hard with some books.  I could talk about Ulysses or William Gaddis, but I won't.  I will spend a good quality moment or two bitching about Dan Symmons, The Ilium.  OK, lets pretend that I know a lot of greek/roman mythos, which I don't --but have a partner who is a smartypants and reminds me what  Achilles got from the Gods, or what gods humped which mortals, et al. If I hadn't known all that, the book would have been ass.  But *aside* from that, Symmons has gone the sci-fi route of throwing the reader into the midst of a world without bothering to explain terms or societal structures.  150 pages or so, you finally kind of get it, and you end up skimming the beginning to make sure you didn't miss any plot points.   Now the book is well written (for the most part) and that is part of the bullshit--I *want* to understand what is happening.  I want to really figure out all the sideplots (like the blue light of Jewish souls --what the sam-hell is that all about) and I know that he is just manipulating me into waiting for the second book to explain all the crap I missed.   I am left with this feeling that if I had read better I might have gotten something more, something transcedant.  I could have gotten a better grade.  There are other things that piss me off about the dirth of decent, fun books in 2003, but I blew my load on that one.  2004 better kick ass or I am getting TIVO.

      Its been a roller coaster of a week.  Seeing hundreds of gay couples get married this week in San Francisco has made me more proud to be an American than almost ever before.  Certainly it has been the best that I have felt about being American since 9/11.  Seeing people cry and kiss as they celebrate something that should have been their right long ago fills me with warm goo (the good kind).  How can you look at the pure joy on their faces as they commit to spend the rest of their lives together and think that's wrong?  How can you look at those people and tell them they have no right to want a sacred union?    On the other end of the spectrum, Dean has stepped down from the democratic primary race.  Its hard to see him go.  He filled me with a certain Kennedy-ish feeling, like my values had a voice.  Listening to the Governor talk about universal healthcare and the rights of all people to marry had me standing in front of the TV jumping up and down.  My friend Jonathan urlLink   says that Dean raised the discourse by talking about issues that matter and I think he is right.  But its hard to go from being a Deaniac to a "Anyone but Bush" and I am proud of Dr. Dean for supporting the democratic ticket unconditionally by not running as third party candidate.   Goodbye, Doctor Dean, we loved you.  On a personal front, I am going in tomorrow for a blood test to see if I am pregnant.  I think I am not.  But then,  I hate the disappointment of feeling foolishly optimistic.  This is always the hardest part of all the infertility stuff.  The last two weeks, all you do is wait.  We wait to find out whether they worked, and knowing they probably didn't.  I don't know if we will keep trying, Jamie and I have been taking it month by month to make sure that we feel committed.  Our life is pretty awesome, and so if we are unable to have a baby, we will still have all the wonderful things we have now (and more money).

      Life is crap.  My to-do list has grown to such depth and breadth that I require a few different colors of inks to make it less oppressive.  On top of all of that, March is coming and it is the ugliest month.  Why?   Because there are no breaks at all until spring break the first week in April.  Nothing to keep the children from driving me insane.  As a school counselor, I should be immune to the irksome features of teenagers, but March makes it extra hard.  Why? First of all, they are all burned out after 6 months of school. And it starts to get warm outside. And they all break up with their boy/girlfriends because the smell of teen spirit is a siren's call. And the Seniors start to fully realize that they are almost done with the craphole that is high school. And they get into college. Or they don't get into college and all their friends do. And thongs start to appear out of the top of shorts like hedgehogs looking for their shadow. And there is nothing to look forward to. March is the Iditarod of high school.  I am girding as we speak.

      I got spammed an email that read:  "We have lots of mature panties..." (for sale I assume). What the fuck does that mean? And who the hell is that appealing to? Don't get me wrong, I understand the idea that people buy panties to act out their fantasies.  But what does a mature panty indicate?  Ones that don't have the days of the week on them?  (my favorite was always Tuesday, they were pink)  Lets be clear, I think that commercializing sexuality and its fetishes is great (excluding kiddie porn and snuff films).  I think it makes people happy, helps the economy and the world is a better place.  I just want to understand why.

      My man wrote an ode:  Ode: To the Student Not Listening To Me Right Now  My comatose-like student; I’ve toiled long To find the poem, the novel or the song To wake your snow-flake gaze, The frozen stare as I speak right at you, Dispel the haze That shrouds your droopy face; oh what to do With souls which won’t reflect! My stomach upset now That drool is pooling round your desk, Like gooey slime from snoring ogre’s jowels.  My talky-talk, my unsilent failed mime Your mouth, like a castle in peaceful time, Remains open still! Must I declare war to shut that noisy door? I’ve had my fill Of chatter, speeches, beaches with no shore! I try to teach fun words Like onomatopoeia  You whisper so I won’t hear you? Well clearly I can onomato--see-you!  But now the worst: I’ve found the homework hound  The hardest soul to save; no song, no sound  Can break the pensive trance Of scribbles, study sheets and textbooks thick; Math figures dance On paper hid in Hamlet; the romantic To be or not to be reduced to nil. You escape the class frantic, Cornell notes dripping, Chem books spill, And all you catch is “What a piece of work”.  The student listens not: oh woe to you! Wake up!  Shut up!  Put down your work, do! These poets speak Of truth, unseen yet treasure through words won; How gross and weak If you heed not warnings and sleep with your son, Kiss Alison’s bare butt, Or get singed while you fart! The tool to reach you I just cannot find, So since you can’t hear me; you can kiss my behind.

         10 QUESTIONS FOR. . .  Al Franken      Q. 1. Do you think President Bush knowingly and deliberately lied to the American people about the WMD's used as a causus belli, or is George W. Bush so gullible that he was he completely hoodwinked by Cheney and the pro-war neoconservative crew at the Pentagon so that he actually believed that Iraq had all those WMD stockpiles?      A. Americans have to ask some serious questions about this. What did the president know and, if not, why didn't he know it? If, as may be the case, the president did not understand his intelligence briefings, did he ask to have them explained to him? And did he know that he didn’t understand them? These are questions that must be asked repeatedly and in an accusatory tone.  Q. 2. Is George W. Bush unaware that he is intellectually uncurious, or does he "know that he does not know" (to paraphrase Socrates)? What's the worst thing he's done since becoming president?  A. I think he believes that it's not important to be intellectually curious — that's for intellectuals. As far as the worst thing he's done, I'd say it was to hijack 9/11 and use it for his own political agenda. After 9/11 this country was more united than I'd ever seen it. And almost the entire world was behind us. He squandered an opportunity to lead this country and the world into a new American century. It's sad.  Q. 3. How do you counter the misplaced, ill-conceived, malignant idealism of a Ralph Nader campaign without appearing cynical?  A. I think we should just ignore Nader. But I'd encourage Republican friends to take a good, hard look at the Libertarian candidate for president.  Q. 4. The New York Times piece on you noted that you are considering running for the Senate in Minnesota in '08. Are you serious about this?  A. Yes. I grew up in Minnesota and come back all the time. If I thought I'd be the strongest DFL candidate to take back Wellstone's seat, I'd go for it. But I probably should discuss it with my family. Also, I have a radio show to do. First things first.   Q. 5. Developing a Limbaugh-sized audience requires commentary that is simplistic to the point of being moronic and cynical to the point of being paranoid. How could a liberal radio talk show host conceivably rise (or sink) to such a challenge?  A. I don't buy your premise. Their entertainment value is bile and bluster and distortion and lies. I believe the facts are on our side but realize that there's more to being entertaining than just reciting facts. So, I'm going to be funny, combative and charming.  Q. 6. Our nation experiences eight years of unparalleled prosperity and international good will. Then, come election time, 50 percent of our country decides to vote out the party that brought us our good times. Now, on the combined domestic and international fronts we are at an unprecedented low, yet all the pundits are expecting a tight race. What the hell is wrong with us?!   A. I think Clinton made it look too easy. Here he was a successful president with one hand tied behind his back, always under assault by a hostile Congress and the nutcase right. Americans just assumed it wasn't that hard to be president so they took a flyer on Bush. Gore paid for Clinton's sins, and Bush pretended to be something he's not. As far as this year? I believe the mainstream media's been cowed and not doing their job, leaving the right-wing media free to present a distorted view of this administration. I think this is the most radically conservative administration in history and, if we don't get these guys out of there, the deck will be stacked for decades.  Q. 7. Picture it. President Bill Clinton stands before the American public and misleads us into thinking that we were in imminent danger and that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, and we know they have them because we know where they are! We must go to war. With the result the same as it became with George W. Bush, what would the G.O.P. have done?  A. Impeachment.  Q. 8. Granted, Rush is a big, fat idiot, and Bush is an easy target, but I'd like to hear you be more critical of the Democrats — is there anything about John Kerry that gives you pause?  A. Not yet.   Q. 9. Why do liberals like you, Al Franken, hate America?  A. Liberals like me love America. We just love America in a different way. You love America like a 4-year-old loves his mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a 4-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad and helping your loved one grow. Love takes attention and work and is the best thing in the world. That's why we liberals want America to do the right thing. We know America is the hope of the world, and we love it and want it to do well. We also want it to do good.  Q. 10. I've got aunts and uncles who are Republican. I really miss the days when Republicans and Democrats could talk civilly, search for common ground, and agree to disagree on the other stuff. Like my dad taught me, "Reasonable people can disagree." At the same time you lament the debasement of civic discourse, you don't exactly elevate it yourself. Why can't we talk about politics without questioning the motives and intelligence of the other side?  A. Nuts to you.

      Is there a mandatory amount of blogging that must take place per week in order to maintain a certain cache?  My lackadaisical blogging has annoyed enough of my friends that they feel the need to needle me.  But it begs the larger question of what is enough?   For example, in high school there was the unwritten rule that you could not wear the same thing more than once a week.  I think that jeans fell outside that rule, but everything else was fair game.  Was this just for girls?  I don't think so, but I cannot remember high school boy wardrobes enough to look for a pattern.  All I know is that I could only wear my Lacoste polo shirt once a week.   Somehow, I kept that standard in the work place (though I must admit that I am working in a high school). I can only wear my favorite black cashmere turtleneck once a week.   I can wear the same shoes for two days in a row, but not three.   I can wear the same earrings indefinitely unless they are a color and then only as long as they match my skirt/blouse.  I can wear the same barrette in my hair only for two days and then it has to change. I can wear black tights everyday, but not the same color tights every day.  You get the picture.  I also cannot wear more than one color at the same time (unless one of the colors is denim or its plaid).  But that has nothing to do with high school.  Its just that color makes me a little itchy and so I have to limit my exposure.  Left to my own devices, I would wear the same white or black tshirt with jeans and clunky black shoes every day.  Unfortunately, I feel bound by gender code to produce the occasional ensemble.  While we are on the topic, I have been wondering if there is an age when I stop wearing jeans.  When my 501s become old lady jeans, I want to think that I will give up denim with grace.

      And as the minds of most of the people I know turn to cleaning out the dustmites and whacking a few proverbial rugs, I came across this in Salon.  If this is not true about your relationship--you are lying.    I put up with more than my girlfriend does In an ideal relationship, shouldn't the annoyances be equally distributed?   - - - - - - - - - - - - By Cary Tennis    March 8, 2004  |  Dear Cary,   I am a light sleeper, and my girlfriend is a heavy sleeper. She sets the alarm for an hour or so before she gets out of bed. She says she should get out of bed after a snooze or two, but she never does. She does not react to the alarm at all for the first five or so times that it goes off. But I can't stand it, so I get up and hit the snooze button and mutter something to her about what time it is. She doesn't respond to me. Finally she gets up, but by then I'm irritated and mostly awake. Sometimes I lie in bed, wide awake, thinking about how irritated I am. I don't need to get up until an hour after she gets up, but in the meantime I feel like I am not getting real sleep. This morning when the alarm went off for the fifth or sixth time I made a growling noise, and her feelings were hurt. She feels like I shouldn't get annoyed with her for something she can't help.   We've talked about this several times over the past few months. She says that she can't set the alarm for the time she actually gets up because she needs the snoozing to wake her up. I've thought about getting a fancy alarm clock with a beautiful chime that gradually gets louder, but that'll wake me up long before it wakes her up. I've also thought about just getting up when the alarm first rings, and letting her hit snooze until she gets up, but I also hate listening to the alarm beep for 20 minutes straight while I'm sitting in the other room.   Even if you don't have practical advice (which I would dearly love), maybe you can help me not feel like this is a microcosm of our relationship. I often feel like I put up with things that I don't like more than she puts up with things that she doesn't like. I don't put up with them in silence, because I tell her how I feel. But when push comes to shove, most of the time I am more flexible (or something) than she is. Which I take some pride in, to be honest, but then I feel both put upon and guilty for feeling martyrlike.     Sleepy and Grumpy (and Maybe a Little Dopey)   Dear Sleepy,   Microcosm? Microcosm, you ask? Could this be a microcosm? Mon sembable, mon frere, O bleary-eyed, put-upon boyfriend among legions of bleary-eyed, put-upon boyfriends, this is a microcosm not only of your relationship but of all relationships, from the subatomic to the cosmic to the metaphysical. In fact, this phenomenon is described in Cary's First Law of Subjective Thermodynamics, which states that though the total energy in a system remains constant, it always seems like you're putting up with more crap than she is.   It is theoretically possible that your subjective view could be correct: Because energy and crap in the universe tend to cluster, it's possible that you're putting up with more than she is. But it's highly unlikely. What science has shown is that women put up with more crap than men, but they do it invisibly, using methods that can't be seen by the naked eye or even identified with telescopes.   You don't want to know all the crap she puts up with. You're better off not knowing. The last thing you want to do is goad her into telling you how she secretly cringed at that joke you told at her best friend's engagement party, how she can't believe your shoes, how she secretly thinks you're in the wrong job, how she likes your family but feels a little sorry for them because they just seem a little seedy, how ... unless you like the idea of lying on the kitchen floor, crumpled into a fetal ball, whimpering with self-loathing, you just don't need to know.   The funny thing is, you put up with all her crap out of principle, because that's what a guy does, and you feel good about how you put up with it, so you tell her about how you put up with it -- because you love her! -- and when she doesn't thank you, it seems like she's not being grateful or she really doesn't care. What a bitch!   This alarm business is the worst. I still don't understand why my wife can't creep around silently in the dark until I'm awake -- the way I do when she's sleeping. Maybe it's because she never played "commando" as a kid; I kind of like being stealthy, actually; it's a test of skill. But she, she just wants to get dressed and grind some coffee beans.   What I'm trying to say to you, my comrade in annoyance, is that your sacrifices are by nature invisible to the other party, because they are actions not taken. And while they loom large to you, describing them is a no-win situation, because what you describe, when you describe how you put up with something, is you describe your own previously well-disguised intolerance. Intolerance is not admirable. Intolerance of another person's habits is not made more admirable simply because you didn't act on it; furthermore, describing your suppressed intolerance is indeed acting on it. So shut up about her alarm clock already. You're not making any headway.   My brother, my double, you are a man, I am a man, and we men were built to shut up and take it. I'm sorry, that may sound medieval, but face it: We do not whine well; it is unbecoming to us. It only inspires women to heap upon us further indignities.   So I will state categorically: No girlfriend or wife is ever going to not annoy you. All wives and girlfriends will at some point do the things that you describe.   Having stated that, one must wonder: Might there indeed be a man out there who has never been annoyed by his wife or girlfriend? The mind staggers at the possibilities. If there be a man who has never been annoyed by his wife or girlfriend, a man in whose universe the crap is equally and amiably distributed, what manner of man might he be? We must hear from him.   So if there be a man who can say that his girlfriend or wife has never done any of the following: sniffed his laundry with disdain, frowned upon his shoes, kept him waiting in a restaurant, made him buy tampons, criticized his brand of milk, taken money and not paid him back, taken up more than her half of the space in the medicine cabinet, thrown away one of his T-shirts, set the alarm for the wrong time, left hair in the sink, bought an unfamiliar brand of toothpaste, insisted upon strange standards of kitchen cleanliness, suggested they get more pets, wondered aloud about having triplets, wanted to move to a nicer neighborhood without a nightclub downstairs, failed to adore all his friends from work, gone to bed before he was tired, told him afterward what he should have said, asked why he paid so much, not admired his mechanical skills, failed to compliment him on how many pushups he can do, beat him at Scrabble and forgot the score, not gotten a joke or gotten it but found it inane, turned the inside light on in the car and flipped down the visor mirror to apply makeup on the way to a party and then forgot to turn the inside light off in the car, forcing him to ask her to please turn off the inside light, or never in any other way failed to live up to his ideal of the perfect mate, I would very much like to hear from him.   The rest of you men: Soldier on.

      There is this fine line between being inspired and being daunted by great art. When I look at the quilts that these women have made, I am  so impressed by the skill and artistry.  Seeing what women can create with so very little makes my own art seem paltry and unimportant.  How can women weave being an artist into the struggle for survival in such rural poverty?  They say that quilting is the best part of their day, to get together as women and create art seems like such a pure thing.  So take a moment to appreciate true art. I know I did.  http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/

       Some observations from the Davis show :  Punk songs are so cute.  Too bad they are only 90 seconds long.  I love the dude that is crowd surfing when the 90 seconds ends and they drop him like rock.  Poor dude, he might want to ice that.  They have this cool thing where you can buy a CD of the show you just saw and it doesn't have the drunk girl screaming "WOOOO!" in the middle of all the tunes.    I still get excited about wearing my concert Tshirt to school the next day.    General Admission seating is getting hrader for me to handle.  I get a little claustrophobic-y with all the people right next to me.    I love to watch the pit.  I love how it undulates to the baseline.    I got home too late.  There may be some quality nap time under the desk during 5th period.

      One of the great things about being over 30 is that I have made my piece with being a woman.  What I mean is that I know that I am ok with not getting shorter, scrawnier, girlie or quiet.  And that's cool because being tall, curvy, and loud has gotten me a lot of great things.   With that said, I still have small moments of doubt when people brag about how wonderful a girl is by describing a quality that I don't have.  Recently I heard a girl described with obvious admiration as being a delicate little flower.   Lets be clear, I may be a lot of wonderful things--but there's no part of me that is a delicate little flower.  And for a moment,  I was bummed.  I want to be thought of as a delicate little flower.  But then, I don't really.  I like that I am funny and loud and irreverent.  I just think there is this sick part of me that wants to be all things that people find attractive.  I want to be skinny and curvy and smart and charming and dirty and dignified and a kick-in-the-pants.  I want to be everything to everyone.  Sometimes. Most of the time, I like that I am special in my own little way.  I like who I am and how I have grown up.  And that's cool. I will never be a delicate little flower.   But hey, I will never be overlooked either. So I guess its all even.

      Ok, so I have been mulling over how I wanted to talk about this idea for some time.  I have run it by my friends in its beta form and I'm still not sure I can say what I want to the right way.  But here goes. There is this phenomenon that happens with things like blogs (and the entertainment industry--but I don't care about them, so I will stick to the little people) that I am trying to make my peace with.  There are a number of people's blogs or websites that I check in on fairly regularly.  This goes along with the fact that I also google all my ex-friends and lovers to see what they are up to (everyone does that, right?).  Now most of the sites that I check on are of people that I know or used to know, but some (one in particular) I don't know at all.  I have never shaken hands or found out their last name.  I read about them once every few days and see how their lives are going and what things piss them off/make them smile.  And I feel like we are friends. I feel close to them.  When things go horribly wrong for these bloggers, it breaks my heart.  I want to comfort them, send an email expressing my condolences or just let them know I am thinking about them.  But I don't.    Because its cre epy .    Why do I feel close to them?  I think that part of the reason is that though our relationship is completely one sided.  They entertain me, teach me things, tell me how they think, and its like they are letting me into their world.  And so I feel welcomed and charmed by their anecdotes.  But that's not a relationship.  There is no give and take.  In fact, I think you could argue that my desire to turn our relationship into a reciprocal one borders on stalking.    But I guess the big question that I'm trying to figure out is this.  Is it weird to be invested in the lives of others when they are not invested in you? If someone read this and emailed me with their thoughts on this or whether the skateboarding bulldog is cool, would that be weird for me?  One one level, yes.  It would be a reminder that I do not send out my blog into the dark unknown, there are people that read it and think about what I say.  On another level, I would be excited that people out there read it and think about what I say.  How cool is that!    So no real answers I guess.  In the final analysis, I like that I plunge my universe into the universes of others.  And the side effect is sometimes creepy.

      A big shout out to Shaolin for kicking this down:   Madame, ist thou donning space underwear? For thine ass doth lie beyond the physical boundaries of this world!    urlLink http://www.madsci.org/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~lynn/jardin/SCG/    You are as frightful as an engine developed solely for the countenance of sexual inuendo by country music.

      My husband is an English teacher who only teaches 12 graders.  Recently he was absent and sent me this email about the sub:   My sub left a note that said he was uncomfortable showing the Breakfast Club (he called "The Breakfast") because of its "inappropriate language and bad omens".   What were the bad omens?  She was uncomfortable showing a PG movie to 18 years olds?  Does she drink heavily? The thing is, it makes me realize that all the subs I ever had that I thought were complete nut jobs were probably, in fact, complete nut jobs.   Home schooling is starting to make more and more sense....

      In a recent discussion with Shaolin, we talked about how Bauhaus can be really cold and while you can see its impressiveness, you wouldn't want it in your house.  I love Bauhaus for its commitment to form following function, with its long clean lines and stark efficiency, but I  do  think it lacks warmth a lot of the time.  Take a look at these quilts--coming out of east Palo Alto, no less.  urlLink http://www.sushmaquilts.com/pages/03_gallery_wall_full.html

       Often, as a school guidance counselor. I am the lone voice that says things like "You are disturbed that he draws guns in class?  Of course he does, he's angry.  He's 15, looks awful, his parents control his life and he can't drive--its a wonder he doesn't throw stuff at you. He's not going to shoot people, he's just letting off some steam. "   This is not something that my post menopausal women-filled office can comprehend.  Michael Chabon says it far better than I ever could.  So read this and go find some skate punk and buy him a burrito--he's had a rough day.   OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR /NYTIMES.com Solitude and the Fortresses of Youth By MICHAEL CHABON   AN FRANCISCO — Earlier this month my local paper, The San Francisco Chronicle, reported that a college student had been expelled from art school here for submitting a story "rife with gruesome details about sexual torture, dismemberment and bloodlust" to his creative writing class. The instructor, a poet named Jan Richman, subsequently found herself out of a job. The university chose not to explain its failure to renew Ms. Richman's contract, but she intimated that she was being punished for having set the tone for the class by assigning a well-regarded if disturbing short story by the MacArthur-winning novelist David Foster Wallace, "Girl with Curious Hair." Ms. Richman had been troubled enough by the student's work to report it to her superiors in the first place, in spite of the fact that it was not, according to the Chronicle, "the first serial-killer story she had read in her six semesters on the faculty at the Academy of Art University."   Homicide inspectors were called in; a criminal profiler went to work on the student. The officers found no evidence of wrongdoing. The unnamed student had made no threat; his behavior was not considered suspicious. In the end, no criminal charges were brought.   In this regard, the San Francisco case differs from other incidents in California, and around the country, in which students, unlucky enough to have as literary precursor the Columbine mass-murderer Dylan Klebold, have found themselves expelled, even prosecuted and convicted on criminal charges, because of the violence depicted in their stories and poems. The threat posed by these prosecutions to civil liberties, to the First Amendment rights of our young people, is grave enough. But as a writer, a parent and a former teenager, I see the workings of something more iniquitous: not merely the denial of teenagers' rights in the name of their own protection, but the denial of their humanity in the name of preserving their innocence.  It is in the nature of a teenager to want to destroy. The destructive impulse is universal among children of all ages, rises to a peak of vividness, ingenuity and fascination in adolescence, and thereafter never entirely goes away. Violence and hatred, and the fear of our own inability to control them in ourselves, are a fundamental part of our birthright, along with altruism, creativity, tenderness, pity and love. It therefore requires an immense act of hypocrisy to stigmatize our young adults and teenagers as agents of deviance and disorder. It requires a policy of dishonesty about and blindness to our own histories, as a species, as a nation, and as individuals who were troubled as teenagers, and who will always be troubled, by the same dark impulses. It also requires that favorite tool of the hypocritical, dishonest and fearful: the suppression of constitutional rights.   We justly celebrate the ideals enshrined in the Bill of Rights, but it is also a profoundly disillusioned document, in the best sense of that adjective. It stipulates all the worst impulses of humanity: toward repression, brutality, intolerance and fear. It couples an unbridled faith in the individual human being, redeemed time and again by his or her singular capacity for tenderness, pity and all the rest, with a profound disenchantment about groups of human beings acting as governments, court systems, armies, state religions and bureaucracies, unchecked by the sting of individual conscience and only belatedly if ever capable of anything resembling redemption.  In this light the Bill of Rights can be read as a classic expression of the teenage spirit: a powerful imagination reacting to a history of overwhelming institutional repression, hypocrisy, chicanery and weakness. It is a document written by men who, like teenagers, knew their enemy intimately, and saw in themselves all the potential they possessed to one day become him. We tend to view idealism and cynicism as opposites, when in fact neither possesses any merit or power unless tempered by, fused with, the other. The Bill of Rights is the fruit of that kind of fusion; so is the teenage imagination.  The imagination of teenagers is often — I'm tempted to say always — the only sure capital they possess apart from the love of their parents, which is a force far beyond their capacity to comprehend or control. During my own adolescence, my imagination, the kingdom inside my own skull, was my sole source of refuge, my fortress of solitude, at times my prison. But a fortress requires a constant line of supply; those who take refuge in attics and cellars require the unceasing aid of confederates; prisoners need advocates, escape plans, or simply a window that gives onto the sky.   Like all teenagers, I provisioned my garrison with art: books, movies, music, comic books, television, role-playing games. My secret confederates were the works of Monty Python, H. P. Lovecraft, the cartoonist Vaughan Bodé, and the Ramones, among many others; they kept me watered and fed. They baked files into cakes and, on occasion, for a wondrous moment, made the walls of my prison disappear. Given their nature as human creations, as artifacts and devices of human nature, some of the provisions I consumed were bound to be of a dark, violent, even bloody and horrifying nature; otherwise I would not have cared for them. Tales and displays of violence, blood and horror rang true, answered a need, on some deep, angry level that maybe only those with scant power or capital, regardless of their age, can understand.   It was not long before I began to write: stories, poems, snatches of autobiographical jazz. Often I imitated the work of my confederates: stories of human beings in the most extreme situations and states of emotion — horror stories; accounts of madness and despair. In part — let's say in large part, if that's what it takes to entitle the writings of teenagers to unqualified protection under the First Amendment — this was about expression. I was writing what I felt, what I believed, wished for, raged against, hoped and dreaded. But the main reason I wrote stories — and the reason that I keep on writing them today — was not to express myself. I started to write because once it had been nourished, stoked and liberated by those secret confederates, I could not hold back the force of my imagination. I had been freed, and I felt that it was now up to me to do the same for somebody else, somewhere, trapped in his or her own lonely tower.  We don't want teenagers to write violent poems, horrifying stories, explicit lyrics and rhymes; they're ugly, in precisely the way that we are ugly, and out of protectiveness and hypocrisy, even out of pity and love and tenderness, we try to force young people to be innocent of everything but the effects of that ugliness. And so we censor the art they consume and produce, and prosecute and suspend and expel them, and when, once in a great while, a teenager reaches for an easy gun and shoots somebody or himself, we tell ourselves that if we had only censored his journals and curtailed his music and video games, that awful burst of final ugliness could surely have been prevented. As if art caused the ugliness, when of course all it can ever do is reflect and, perhaps, attempt to explain it.   Let teenagers languish, therefore, in their sense of isolation, without outlet or nourishment, bereft of the only thing that makes it all bearable: knowing that somebody else has felt the way that you feel, has faced it, run from it, rued it, lamented it and transformed it into art; has been there, and returned, and lived, for the only good reason we have: to tell the tale. How confident we shall be, once we have done this, of never encountering the ugliness again! How happy our children will be, and how brave, and how safe!

       This is from the Cary Tennis column at salon.com (I think he is a big smartypants)   I am engaged to a fantastic person. For the first time I feel I am with someone who loves me for who I am, and not for who they want me to be. He loves it all, the good and the ugly, and that leaves me feeling very at ease in this relationship. I also feel I've come to a point in my maturity where I can reciprocate such a love.   In the course of planning our wedding, certain issues have come up that never seem to come up until the reality of spending the rest of your lives together is concrete and imminent. We've weathered all of these touchy areas (our mutually dysfunctional family histories, our finances) very well. But there is one thing that has come up a few times that I've been unable to resolve and I don't know if I'm oversensitive about it or whether I have real cause for concern.   Once, when we were discussing various statistics I've read about the success rates of marriage, he asked me on what grounds would I ever divorce him. I had to wrack my brain to think of something that would make me want to lose this valuable person from my life. Almost anything seemed workable when I thought about it. So, I threw out something that seemed not even remotely possible: child molestation. When I returned the question, I expected to get back an equally morally reprehensible reason, something he knew I would never act upon. Instead, he said, "Well, if you gained a lot of weight, I would probably divorce you."        I was more than surprised and I argued with him that he should love me as a person, not for my body, and that there were a myriad of reasons that I could gain weight, other than pure lack of concern for my health and/or laziness. To him, though, me gaining 50 or so pounds meant that I would become undesirable to him and that I had no concern for his desire for me and that I had changed as a person.   It hasn't really come up since then, but last night we were watching a program about obese teens, and he made the comment that he was glad I didn't weigh as much as one of the profiled teenage girls did. I made a joke about being glad as well, but his comments about my gaining weight have been buzzing annoyingly in my mind.       Growing up, I had issues with weight control. I starved myself for a few months as a teenager, but upon hearing from friends that I looked unwell, I began eating again. My stepmother would weigh and measure me every time I went to visit my father until I was finally old enough to tell her to shut up. I had a relationship in my early 20s with a vegan boy who asked me to become vegan in order to maintain the relationship. When he caught me eating (horrors!) something with dairy in it, he'd berate me, calling me weak and unfaithful. My current partner has never made me feel this way and part of me feels he thinks my gaining weight is as unlikely as him committing a sexual crime. I guess I just find his attitudes toward obesity judgmental and not compassionate.   It is unlikely that I would gain an unusual amount of weight, but I don't like the worry of doing so hanging over my head. Am I being overly insecure because of my past experiences or do I have real reason to feel wary of moving forward with this person? In nearly every cell of my being, I feel positive and secure about marrying this person, but I can't let this issue go.   Worried    Dear Worried,   I think you have real cause for concern. If you have a history of susceptibility to body weight issues, and he has an unusually intense interest in your own weight, I think that's a recipe for trouble. Neither you nor he seems to have a great problem in and of itself, but when you're paired, you're like catalysts for each other.   I think you should talk to him again about this theoretical question and find out if he was kidding. If not, it could be trouble. I'm no expert, and so the opinions of some experts would be helpful here. But as a connoisseur of madness, I believe we all carry the seeds of self-treachery, that we sometimes secretly seek out people who hold the keys to our own destruction. Anorexia seems to be a disease of body-hatred, or self-hatred. To put a finer point on it, perhaps we seek to become divine by freeing ourselves of the gross material and animal forces that circumscribe our reality, that burden us with birth, life, eating, shitting, disease and death. We try to displace those irksome terms of service with standards of eternal beauty through thinness and wasting. If so, if that's what the disease is all about, then you may have found the perfect person to trigger that disease, and are thus in some danger of succumbing to it.   You may in fact have that disease in some latent form, and have sought out this man -- or your disease has sought out this man -- so it can fulfill itself. (As addicts sometimes do.) If he were to threaten to leave you if you did not stay thin, perhaps you think you need a man to threaten to leave you so that you can stay thin.   Part of the problem is the assumption that there is a real you that can be loved apart from your body. I'm not sure how much sense that makes. If there were a real you that could be loved apart from your body, what's the sense in getting married? Why not just be loved at a distance? Love is not an abstract essence; it is a behavior. Love is an action performed on a body. I don't necessarily mean sex itself, but I do mean that you have to be there for love -- you bring your body with you. That's a bit of a tangent, but I get the feeling that the mind-body split has much to do with the weight problem: That if the mind were truly sovereign over the body, it could keep the body thin, and thus the refusal to eat is a declaration of sovereignty over the animal. At the root of that is the false notion that the two are split. No better evidence could arise of its falsity than the fact that when the mind gains sovereignty over the body and stops it from eating, the body dies, and with it, presumably, the all-sovereign mind.   The mind is presumed to die unless, allied with the disease of anorexia, there is a belief in afterlife. I haven't really looked into what dead anorexics believed. It's a terrible and tragic thing, and I don't mean to treat it cavalierly: What you hear in my voice, I think, is not a cavalier attitude, really, but an exasperated and tragic anger, such as that I feel when I see heroin addicts die, such as that I feel as I watch Courtney Love fall apart in front of our eyes, such as I've felt when I've seen my friends die from drugs and alcohol. It's not pretty and it's not funny.   So I'm begging you now, get some help from an expert on eating disorders.

      Well, its the first day of passover and I am already staring at my husband, Jamie's hot dog (no, this is not a metaphor) longingly.  I used to think that keeping passover was silly in the same way that I think that any religious dietary laws are outdated and unnecessary.  Can I help it if I love the cheeseburger?  I don't begrudge people that want go kosher--more power to them, but I am certainly not looking to the Torah for dietary guidance any more than if Jamie dies will I become his brother, John's woman.  So why is this year different?  Well, I have come to believe that sometimes its good to take a break from things to give you a better appreciation for what you have.  This became clear when my doctor told me I needed to cut out all the junk in my diet and watch my dairy & wheat intake.  So I stopped eating desserts, drinking lattes and started having more fruits and veggies.  The first three weeks were pretty brutal.  I had a physical longing for cookies,biscuits and a good stinky cheese.  But it passed and I got used to it. There is a huge difference in how I feel physically.  I feel cleaner and lighter and have more energy.  My gastro-intestinal system is pretty pleased with itself.  When the holidays loomed I made the decision that I wanted keep passover.  Just to see how it effected me.  Would I feel even better, more focused spiritually? I think there is something about a physical reminder of your beliefs.  There is something to making it clear that you are a part of a group, especially one that is a minority.  Does it make me feel more Jewish?  Maybe.  One of the things about formally converting is that you are really clear about the choice to be a part of something.  I jumped through the hoops knowing that this was the religion I valued.  This religion was the one that I was the most connected to, that most resembled me.  At the same time, when you tell people that you have converted--there is that feeling from some that you still aren't *really* Jewish.  Which is ridiculous, but still there.  So I sit next to a big pink Matzos box at work and nibble as I plod away at scheduling students into classes.  And I am sure by next Tuesday, I will be jonesing for pizza and beer.  But I hope I get a little perspective on the way.

      Across the street, a house is up for sale.  And if you have $900K you could be the lovely owner of a pristine craftsman with a koi pond.  The owners are very nice people and have put a lot of energy into renovating the kitchen and baths to make them awfully purdy.  Claw-footed tub, Wolf range, the whole package.    It was nice to see what our craftsman would look like if we redid all the rundown parts.  Jamie and I played fantasy house where we imagined what it would be like to have all sorts of saucy appliances that wash your dishes  for you , which seems decadent, and a bathtub that we could stretch out in together and massage each other's feet.  Someday...  I love my house, I truly do, but there are times when all those sterile loft spaces with huge open spaces and shiny new bits call to me in my sleep.  I just keep thinking that I could park my scooter and my 2 bulldogs in the living room and have book shelves that required a built in ladder. Mmmmhhhmmm...built in ladder....

      Ok, well, I haven't actually *read* the  urlLink book , but the review makes it seem brilliant.  Its a collection of notes/cards/detritus that the author has found over the years.  Here is a little sample: A scrawled note on the windshield of his car read: "Mario, I fucking hate you. You said you had to work then why's your car here at her place?? You're a fucking liar. I hate you. I fucking hate you. Amber. PS Page me later."  That is stuff that makes the world go 'round.  F-in brilliant.

      I am reading a book called  urlLink Stiff  that delves into the world of the dead body.  Mary Roach (amusing last name) looks at autopsies and burials and corpses left to rot for forensic science.   She taught me that a dead man can fart.  It's just a great book.  She digs right in there and asks all the really good questions like "how big do testicles get as the body decomposes and swells with internal gas?"  (roughly the size of a softball)  And this stuff fascinates me.   Now I have friends that would be totally disgusted by this sort of thing.  They are completely content not to know that plastic surgeons practice their techniques on decapitated heads.  But I just want to know.  I want to know the how things are going to turn out.  I have always been the one that thought about the gruesome demise of the people I love the most and imagine how I would deal with it.  I sit there, in traffic, and think "Ok, mom and dad both got killed in a tragic mining incident, what do I do?" and then I go through all the possible scenarios.  "Jamie leaves me for that beautiful dwarf we saw at the movies, what do I do?"  And I think about it.  I have plans.  And its not that I want anything to happen to any of them, but I just need to know that I can get through it.  The hardest one to imagine is of course, if something happens to my son.  All I can seem to get to with that one is that I would have to leave the state. But I think I would get through it.  I would go on, heavily sedated but functional.  Sometimes, in fantasizing my reaction to horrible things, I get so far as what color would my new car be after I got the inheritance?  Is this petty?  Maybe.  I need to picture my new world in as much detail as possible.  If Jamie died would I get the bulldog that he wouldn't let me get now?  Would I get four?  And I decide (two--so they wouldn't be lonely and I would name them Fred & Ethyl) so that I know that I would be ok.    Maybe I fantasize about all the details so that I don't focus on the larger truths.  The larger truth that the death of some people in my life would break my heart.  I don't know if, when it all comes down to it, that I will be able to  focus on the details to avoid the loss.  Will having read the book make me more comfortable with my loved one's corpse?  God, I hope so.

      I have been to 5 weddings this spring.  Five. The last one was this last weekend in Paramus, New Jersey and was quite a blow out. It was an Assyrian Orthodox wedding.  The bride and the vast majority of the guests are Indian and so, except for our little enclave of college friends, it was beautiful saris as far as the eye could see. The wedding was 2 1/2 hours long.  The bishop of the church performed the ceremony in this amazing "Elvis in Vegas" robe and had an assistant that held the microphone to his mouth for the hour long diatribe on virginal women serving their men and the mystery of the union (I knew it was a mystery because he used the word in every sentence, around 50 times).  The wedding couple never spoke.  They never kissed.  At one point, he got to tie her up. But not in a saucy way, more like in a binding, I-own-your-ass kind of way.  There were a lot of giggles from my group.  After the epic ceremony, it just got wierd.  The reception had a DJ that announced all the events in a WWF voice.  Here are some of the many tidbits:  --There were two ice sculptures.  One with their names etched in a heart and the other, I think, was a likeness of the two of them, but the nose on the groom had fallen off.    --The centerpiece at our table was a good three feet tall  --The music was pounding Indian rave music.  It reminded me of the Indian music videos you see on cable access channels.  -- Women in saris manage to dance for hours without ever moving their hips.  Its fascinating to watch.  They seem to dance with their shoulders.  The men all grab white linen napkins and use them to wave in the air and snap other men in the back of the head.  Now I know this sounds like something the younger men might do, but I saw a man about 65 snap the forehead of another guy that could have been his son.    --The cocktail hour before the 4 course main meal had a sushi chef, a carver for the rack of lamb, a pasta bar, an oyster bar with a man shucking them on request and four bartenders.  All before dinner.  This wedding may win the award for being the most unique I have ever been to.  I don't know if it tops the pagan wedding where I had to hike up a hill in the rain to sit in the trees with the nudists, but it runs a close second.

      Before I dated my husband, I had never watched a football game other than the ones from high school when I was in the marching band (those were required).  I had seen images of football games when I went to Sears and at my parent's house--but I had certainly not watched a full game.  Superbowl Sunday always seemed like the best day to go the mall.  Jamie is a Raider's fan.  A big Raider's fan from when he was a kid and his dad took him to games.  Dating him meant that every fall Sunday he would park himself and all his grading in front of the TV and watch three straight games.  Drove me nuts.  Bored me to tears.  But in that moment, at the beginning of it all, when you are willing to be astonishingly flexible for your new mate, I sat with him. You know, before you have that first big fight, when you are still all nerpy and smoochy?  Jamie taught me about football.  He explained the plays and the strategy, talked about players and strengthes of different teams.  Told me who to hate (we hate the KC Chiefs and the Denver Broncos) and what all the team names were.  He explained conferences and playoffs and wildcards.  And at some point, by my second season of watching (and the nights of SportsCenter), I figured it out.  I understood what was happening.  I got excited when my guy made that amazing catch that looks fake but really happened.  I realized that I liked football because you just never know.  Amazing comebacks, crushing defeats, all in real time.  Shit would happen and I would jump to my feet screamimg "Run you little fucker!  Run!!!!!"    My friends don't watch sports.  Or care about sports.  Or talk aboout sports.  It says something that they love Jamie in spite of his football obsession.  We call people that are into sports (or seem....sporty) hoopfouls with no small amount of derision.  My friends shake their head that I am excited to get to go to a Raider game (and if you haven't been, there is nothing like it) and accept this new wierd part of my life in the same way they would if I grew a third eye.  Its that "I love you unconditionally, but DAMN!"    I am starting to get itchy for football season.  I hate baseball.  I am excited to see what happens when TO plays for McNabb (he's the one that Limbaugh made the statements about).  I am excited to see if the Raiders will suck less.   I like that I can have meaningful conversations with strangers about whether the Raiders need a better quarterback (they do).  It is a new way to talk to people and its cool.  So right around the beginning of the fall, when school is back in session and the parents are driving me insane, I will throw out the occasional sports rant. I will sit with my man, while he grades essays, and I will read the NY Times sunday edition and watch football.  And if you aren't busy on Sunday, come on by.

      Someone asked me for a list of things they might like to read.  I usually tailor my recommendations to the style of books people have enjoyed over the last year or so, but I like the idea of providing opportunity to try different stuff. I have deliberately picked ones that I think people might not pick up, so don't be shocked that this is the only book list not to include Dan Brown you've ever seen. None of these are the 'best book ever!' If you want that, let me know. Oh--and Shaolin, you can't put any of these on you palm pilot list until you take all those crappy classics off.     Mysteries  (I read a lot of mysteries) Bangkok 8---Burdett Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time----Haddon Motherless Brooklyn ---- Lethem Beekeeper's Apprentice----Laurie King (the whole series is great) Ganja Coast or Season of the Monsoon----Mann   Literature-ish  Best American Non-required Reading 2003----Editor-- Z. Smith My Year of Meats----Ozecki Drinking Coffee Elsewhere----ZZ Packer (the first story is the best) Bel Canto---- Patchett Bee Season ----Goldberg   Non-Fiction  Tipping Point----Gladwell Fast Food Nation----Schlosser New Jack----Conover   I know a lot of these are still in hardback.  Wait until they go softcover--they aren't worth 25 bucks.  If you really dig them, let me know.  Oh--one more thing--I am pretty sure that if I had finished it in time, Jonathan Lethem's Fortress of Solitude would be on the list.

      A shout out to my girlfriend, Waterbones--she took a rant and made it a thoughtful  urlLink essay.   She is a good egg.  Waterbones, you can be in my scooter club anytime.  Clifford Stohl, back in the 90s, wrote a fun book called the Cuckoo's Egg about hunting down an old school hacker.  It was set in Berkeley where he worked at LBL and was a great read.  It was as much about the Berkeley lifestyle as it was about the globalization of computer hacking.  Afterwards, a lot of people looked up to Stohl as an expert on the budding internet.  And so, a few years later, he wrote another book (that I can't remember or find the name of on Amazon) about the internet and communities.  And talk about being poked with a stick?  Stohl railed on the idea that people were spending their lives in front of a computer, in online communities, playing Evercrack and avoiding their next door neighbor.  It didn't help that he lived in this wonderful neighborhood down the street from me called "Elmwood" where there are wonderful outdoor cafes and people who walk their dogs and chat with the flower lady about biodiesel technology.   Stohl's book was, well, bitter.  He was angry at everyone.  And it pissed me off.  I am a huge believer of communities and I have created and maintained as many communities as I can.  But I am also a big extrovert.  And some people aren't.  Some people need the internet as a intermediary, or a safety net, to find people to connect to.  Or they just stay home and develop relationships with people on TV.  I know that I blogged earlier about how people develop artificial relationships with stars (or those with stars upon thars--sorry)  that they have never met because they commit all this time to them.  In that sense, I think television is wonderful.  Some people need it in the same way they need any intermediary to help them experience life outside of their own.  People like me and Cliff Stohl, we can get out there and talk to the weird guy that walks that adorable pug.    I think we need to be careful what standard we hold people to.  Its too easy to believe that our way is the highway.  I get that way with books.  Whenever I am talking to people about books, I am always disappointed that people haven't read the one I want to talk about.    Oh--one more thing--Waterbones--its awesome that you are working through Shakespeare's canon.  If you haven't got to Troillus and Cressida--move on.  It sucks.

      This will not be eloquent.   I am sick to death of those people that, when asked to describe themselves, say "I have no TV."  I don't have a garbage disposal, but somehow that does not make my 5 descriptors of myself.  The part that pisses me off is that people think, when they say it, that it has great meaning.  That is speaks to personal commitment.  It doesn't.  It means that you don't have a fucking television.  The people I hear talking about their lack of  television seem to indicate that they spend their time doing better things.  Curing cancer.  Stopping hunger.  Accessorizing well.   That's bullshit.  People who do not own televisions fill their time with equally banal forms of entertainment.   If you are going to  draw a line in the sand of coolness to indicate that you are indeed one of the enlightened ones--pick something better.   Damnit.

      I just can't give you that last slice of shitty Americana and not temper it with something.  Anything. But if you read this, you have to read the other one as well.  Fair trade. This is just how catty I am. At another school I worked at ( a middle school) there was a great story I was told, by one of the participants, that I will share with you now.  This story does not, I repeat not, best the story that Shaolin can tell about a bathing suit incident when she was in middle school, but its still good. Ok, so BamBam and Pebbles were in 8th grade and totally in love.  In. Love.  Tried to be together constantly to the exclusion of all others.  Drove their friends away.  Drove their family away.  Grades dropped.  So both sets of  parents got together and decided that they needed to stop the relationship before it got even worse and told the kids that they were no longer allowed to date.  BamBam and Pebbles were heartbroken and decided that they were going to run away together.  Of course they told a few of their friends that this was the plan, because that is what 13 year olds do.  One of the friends realized that this was a big deal and told the parents what was happening. In the meantime, Pebbles and BamBam decide that they would pack their stuff and meet at the front of the school before they headed off.  When they got to school, they started smooching and decided, in short order, that *now* was the time for them to have sex for the first time.   Now back at the parent's house, Mom and Dad have called the other set of parents and the police and headed off to the school, which they had been told was the meeting place.  They drive up, along with the police (lights flashing) to see their children, naked and humping on the bench beneath the flag pole.   As the young man in this story finished his story to me, I was a little stymied.  What do you say?   So I told him this: "BamBam, someday you are going to be old enough to go to a bar with your friends.  And you are going to be trading stories about horrible things that happened to you when you were young.  Someone will tell a story that they think is totally humiliating and you will bet them you can top it.  And then you will tell them this story and they will sit there, struck dumb, and then tell you that that is the worst 'first time' story they have ever heard.  Bet big on this one, cause you are gonna win. "

      I want to think that this is a universal truth.  When you hear or see something truly awful, you tell other people about it so that you can scrape off some of the psychic residue.  You don't want to be the only one that owns that story all alone.  You want to see other people gape in horror or whatever it is they do, so that you can look at them and say, "Exactly!!"   I can't be the only person that does this, right?  I'd also like to say that, in my defense, my bro showed me this commercial where a car decapitated a cat and I know that he was trying to do the same thing.  Fucker. But that's not what I'm getting at.  All this is to justify the tale that I am about to tell.   I was at  the blue school in our district (we are the red school) and talking to other counselors about counseling things when I saw a kid in a wheelchair being wheeled across campus. He was clearly a quadriplegic with no sensation below the neck.  I commented that I thought the green school in our district housed the severely handicapped.  The other counselor said he was a special case. Apparently this bright young man went out for football and didn't make the team.  He decided to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head.  He didn't die. He is now a vegetable who has to be brought to school everyday fully harnessed into a wheelchair. He can't speak. He can't really do anything.  I have no idea what the moral of this tale is, but I just sat and watched him get wheeled by and I thought, damn. And now I am telling you.  To scrape off some of the oogie bits. Thanks.

      Its spring at your local high school and as the temperature rises, some things fall into place.  In case you have blissfully forgotten high school and its artificial highs and lows, let me remind you what spring means.  Spring means that you break out all the clothes that make grownups a little uncomfortable.  Spaghetti straps, bare midriffs and micro-minis become the uniform.  I can tell when it hits 80 degrees by the number of pink thongs that I see creeping out the top of a 4 inch denim skirt.  Girls drape themselves in the sun like those clocks in those cheesy Dali prints we all had in college.  Boys, well boys don't look much different in the spring, they never wear coats to begin with, so they just seem a little more tan and there are more baseball caps than in January.  One of the big things that happens in spring is that everyone breaks up.  There are girls in my office every few days, sobbing that Bobby doesn't want to have a girlfriend anymore.  Even though they agreed, back in December, that they would try and apply to colleges that were near each other and she agreed to give him a handjob in the front seat of his Jeep Cherokee after WinterBall.  As they cry, they consume a pound of the candy that I get from Costco and try to make sense of it all.      When boys get dumped it hits hard.  Really hard.  Even though the girls are the ones that cry the loudest and the longest--they boys just sit and look at you.  They feel utterly alone and have no idea what to do.  They don't understand why.  They don't understand how.  They don't eat candy.  They just stare.  Until at some point, they just nod and leave your office.  I wish that I knew how to help the boys more.  I wish they would eat more candy.    Right around late May, things settle back down and everyone waits for the year to end.  The mating rituals have mellowed and people have paired up or pared down.  They are focused on final exams and end of the year parties. But Spring is rough.  Really rough.

      One of the things about spending all your time with high school kids is that you watch them learning about who they are.  You watch them trying on all kinds of personas and archetypes.  They are all going through something that Erik Erickson calls the Identity Formation as they discover who they are, separate from their parents and community.  Its actually pretty cool to witness and about the time they are heading off to the next step post-high school, they are starting to figure some things out.    I always thought that was that.  But I was wrong. What I have realized at the ripe old age of 34 is that you go through identity formation forever.  It hits peaks at certain points, but there is definitely something there that needs to be addressed.  For me a lot of that comes out in outward appearance.  Shaolin and I say that when we turn 40, its all flowy clothes and big cool chunky jewelry.  What I think of as the Ann Bancroft look.  But I struggle with today.  What is a 34 year old?  Does she still get to wear big boots and plaid skirts?  Can she still dye her hair blue?  Maybe....   But I see it in others as well.  It comes across like lifestyle envy.  Its that thought in the back of your head that says ' I could totally live in a warehouse in East Oakland and weld."  or on the other end of the spectrum--"I could be the cool mom in Lafayette as long as we had a pool."  And at first, I thought it was pretty lame.  That desire to always have something you don't is a pretty crappy way to live your life.  But maybe the occasional lifestyle re-evaluation is good--just to make sure that you have the lifestyle that you want.     So maybe the question  becomes, when you're a grownup, how many times do I get to reinvent myself?  Because should you really have to go through life names Karen if Electra makes you feel beautiful and smart and Greek?  I think that its good to take time and look around and make sure that all our crap is the crap we want, because if pride weren't an issue, wouldn't you do some editing?

      Ok.  For the most part, I live in a pretty hoity toity neighborhood.  Sure, we have the cat lady that sits on her dilapidated porch and mumbles. We have the white trash family with a never ending supply of teenagers that stole packages off people's porches last winter and work on endless crappy Monty Carlos.  But by in large, we have families that make a whole lot more money than we do and can do all kinds of cool things to renovate their old houses.  And for as much as I liked my treelined street and attractive well-to-do neighborettes, I was a little embarrassed that its not more diverse or more, well, urbane.  This all changed today.  Gryphon, Jamie and I were walking down the street towards the local toy store to replace the hackysack that the dog ate when I spotted it.  It was in the attic window of a house about half way down the block.  It looked about four feet tall and maybe 16 inches wide.  It was a green Area 51 looking alien inside a plastic tube.  It gazed, unblinking, at the people walking by.  It is the coolest thing I have seen in a long time.  The greatest thing about it is that unless you were looking closely, you would never notice it.    I have to meet those neighbors at the next block party.

      Watching Kobe Bryant make an absolutely amazing three point shot to win the game last night, Jamie and I argued about whether they would make Kobe the MVP with all his baggage right now.  Can you give the MVP award to a man accused of rape?  In talking about this with my buddy at work, he made the claim that they should give him MVP if he deserves it and that he doesn't believe Kobe is a rapist.  When I asked why, he said that the woman had multiple sexual partners before the rape charge (two days before) and that you couldn't determine conclusively that the vaginal trauma she had was from Kobe.    Now this smacks a little too close to the statement "anyone with multiple sex partners can't be raped" which makes me see red and start to yell about laws trying to enforce moral standards on women.  His argument was that in order to convict someone of rape, the evidence must be more conclusive than that, even if it means that men are not held liable.  Which makes sense, sort of, but also means that men are going to get away with raping women.   Now that brings up a whole issue around what defines rape and who gets to make the call. When I asked my friend what he thought happened, he said he thought that she started off having consensual sex and it got more rough than she wanted.  I asked him if he thought she ever said "no." He hedged his answer.  He said that she may well have said no and but it couldn't be proven that he raped her.  And that is where the sticky wicket lay.   Now,  I believe that the minute a woman says no (regardless of whether she means it), he pulls out and goes home.  He can be pissed and frustrated and never call her again, but because his penis is inside her, she gets to make the call when it isn't ok anymore.  But in the bigger scheme of healthy, safe sexuality, I think that I want it to be both fair and clearcut.  And that isn't what sex is.  Its messy and complicated and changes daily.  I want it to be something that is not influenced but the type of people involved.  How do you structure sexual politics to in a way to give it clear guidelines?  Especially in a world that reinforces that women can be forgiven for sexual proclivities if they are intoxicated or under the influence.  In the end, I think that society is pretty invested in sex being messy--morally, physically, emotionally and most importantly, legally.  There is a book called  urlLink The Morning After,  by Roiphe that came out on the coattails of Paglia's sexual responsibility tirades in Sexual Personae that hit home with me.  Roiphe talked a lot about why men have to be responsible for date rape when girls come to the party, get drunk, hump a frat boy, regret it the next day and call it date rape.  She wanted to know why women aren't responsible for the situation they helped create.  Her point was "don't want to be date raped?  don't get so drunk that you put yourself in a situation that might bring it on."  You can call her a misogynist all you want or hail her as finally speaking the truth, but this is what you get when you try and make it clearcut.  And that doesn't make me any more comfortable.  So I think I am stuck in the waffle.  I believe women need to embrace their sexuality responsibly and be strong in the lines that they draw.  I want them to be cynical and paranoid and free and trusting all at the same time.  What do I do with that?

      Reagan died today.  Now,  I usually don't comment on the news, I leave that to Miniver. But I have always said that while I think he was an idiot, the dude put me through college (my father worked in aerospace).    So I tip my metaphorical hat to the man that looked best as a puppet in a Genesis video.  RIP.

      All of the talk about new living pods over at Waterbones has me thinking about the best apartment I ever lived in.  Now in some ways, the best apartment I ever lived in was the first one that I ever rented on my own.  It was a single in Temescal and while the kitchen was literally three feet wide, it was my first home.   But that apartment is full of different stories.  PimpDaddySkippy and I were barely pregnant when we looked at the place on Colby.  I was in charge of the landlord wooing and once she found out that I taught college kids about sex at SFSU, we were family.  She was a wonderful, large lesbian with a hearty beard and an epileptic dog.  She and her girlfriend practiced their bull whip skills in our backyard and she invited me to my first militant lesbian seder (I was, in fact, invited to join the man-free organic farming compound in Idaho that these women ran--which was sweet, really).   The apartment was beautiful and small (very small).  We loved that place with its big trees and sweet neighbors.  We had the beautiful gay men in the front apartment who gardened every weekend and took me with them to Berkeley Bowl to buy fresh cheap produce.  We had the art school kiddies that loved Elton John and made mosaic furniture for fun.  But mostly, we had Shoshana.  Shoshana had the loudest sex I have ever heard.  Screams, moans, furniture breaking--it was hard core stuff happening over in her bungalow across the yard from us. One night, I got a phone call around 10pm from Shoshana, talking quietly.  She wanted to ask me a sex question, but needed to do it in a small voice so God wouldn't hear. Or at least that's what she told me. "Jake,um, when I have sex, sometimes I pee...is that normal?" "You mean, pee after?" "No. During" "During sex?" "Yes" "Do you do it when you orgasm or just randomly?" "I think its when I orgasm, its hard to tell.." "Oh. Well, are you sure its pee?" "Jake, I am not a man." "No, I know that Shoshana, but women ejaculate sometimes and its not pee." "Well, what the hell is it then?" "I don't know, but women do it." "But I do it...a lot." "What does that mean, Shoshana?" "A lot of stuff comes out." "A cup?" "It soaks the futon." "Oh, well that is a lot. But I think its fine as long as you don't get dehydrated and you feel ok afterwards." "Really?" "I'm not a doctor, but I have certainly known women that have experienced what you are and its totally normal.  Though I think you should thrown out the futon." "Yeah, you're probably right."  This opened up a floodgate (no pun intended) of questions about sex from her and her partner, which was fine.  We had a great time talking about sexual politics and gender issues and how to safely clean sex toys....  But ultimately, we had to move into a cheaper apartment.  And so we left Shoshana and her epileptic dog and her screams and her fabulous hummus.  But I miss it sometimes.

      Feminism and I are strange bedfellows.  I suppose I am a feminist--but I would like to think that I don't have to be.  I have had problems with the voices of feminism that seem to paint women into victims in need of societal reform, but I also think there is a new brand of feminism out there that I like a little better, or at least that I relate to a little better.  Shaolin turned me onto this commencement address by a Barbara Ehrenreich (who wrote a book called Nickeled and Dimed) and I think its very smart.     urlLink http://www.barnard.edu/newnews/news051804d.html

      I was sucking time on the internet and wandered onto Nordstrom's website to peruse their selection of flimsy underthings, when I saw they had a whole section devoted to Ponchos.  That means they have to be selling more than one kind, right?  Well, the online store had 16.  16 Ponchos.   Who the fuck looks good in a Poncho?  Its like telling someone they look good wrapped in a burlap bag.  Hell, it is a burlap bag in wool.  You  can't do anything in a Poncho because you can't lift your arms above your elbows without getting a face full of fluff.  You can't wear a backpack.  You can't eat spaghetti in it.  So here is an item that looks like you are wrapped in cardboard that actually stops you from functioning normal and you need 16 different types?  What the hell is the world coming to?  And while I am on a rant, the other day I saw this attractive scrawny girl with pants so low that walking down the street I could see her ass crack.  It was a perfectly fine ass, but isn't the basic job of pants to cover the crack?  I will cut young ladies and fat men slack that you may see the peek of crack while bending over these days, but walking down the street?  I gotta think that if she bent over I could check out her Brazillian, right?  And don't get me started on mini skirts that are literally three inches long.  Its not a skirt, its a belt.   And thats when it hit me.  I am at that age where what coeds wear no longer applies to me or my sense of rightness in the world as we know it.  I mean, I am the girl that wore a garbage bag to school.  I am the girl, as Alysse reminded me, that wore pink hightop Reeboks.  Who tucked her incredibly tight jeans into Ugg boots.  Who ripped perfectly good jeans in strategically sexy spots.    I was no fashion maven.  But sweet Jeebus, I don't need to see ass crack before 5pm.   And don't get me started on thongs.

      Gryphon came home from day camp yesterday explaining that though his counselor is named Rusty, he has kinky red hair  and a good sense of humor and so 10 nine year olds renamed him Krusty.   Gryphon is going to an outdoor science camp that combines the geeky science/bug appreciation part with the outside in the forest all day part, so he comes home filthy, tired and full of science factoids.    Yesterday they made a compass that apparently didn't work since everyone else's compass threw off the magnet.  Gryphon was not impressed.  The day before that they made a ship in a bottle but the glue melted at some point and the ship fell down.  Gryphon was really not impressed.  But the tide may be changing, last night, over a plateful of pineapple chicken, he told me that today is cool since they can make their own Tang.   Gryphon's goal is 15 scoops per glass.   As a general rule, Gryphon's theme is how underwhelming the world is.  He is practicing his cynical worldview a lot these days.  And as much as it naws at my soul to listen to him hate everything, I suppose I am a wee bit of a cynical trash talker and he may, just may, have gotten the idea that grownups talk shit all the time.  Still, the boy needs to learn charm.  He is starting his ascent to pre-adolescent crankiness a little earlier than I thought.  I know that its normal and that all kids do it.  I know that I shouldn't let it hurt my feelings because its not about me.  I know that Gryphon loves me and I love him and we will get through this with minimal name calling.  But sweet merciful heavens, no wonder my mom drinks.    And did I mention that he is 9?  Not 15.  9.  I am totally doomed.   Oh crap, its 8, I need to wake him up.

      Every year two or three of my students come out to me that they're gay.  They tell me like its something I will be shocked by or something that I haven't known since they were a freshman.  They come out in second semester of senior year, when they can see that high school is ending and they don't feel so tethered to high school conventions.  They usually come out to me first and then to their best friend and then hopefully, to everyone else.  Often it is only me that knows before they go to college, but most tell their parents at that first Christmas.  It makes the holidays special.  I have a technique with students that I know are gay (don't ask me how I know, I just do) where I assume they are gay until they tell me they aren't.  And they always do at first.  I make some comment about dating a hot boy to some young man, he denies that he is gay, waits a month and then tells me he's gay.  I think the thing that brings them to me, the thing that makes them trust me enough to tell me is that I don't care that their gay.  In fact, I think I like the gay kids a little more sometimes.  I see gay coupling in the same terms I see heterosexual coupling and it occurs to me that most people don't.  Which is weird because most of my friends wouldn't give a rat's ass whether someone was shtuping a boy or a girl.  Clearly we are the minority.  Once a gay student comes out to me, we talk about it.  I call him on being ashamed and say over and over that there is nothing wrong with wanting to have sex with Ben Affleck.  It is normal.  It is beauitful.  Its the way you feel and how can that be bad?  Sometimes they talk about God and how God feels and I tell them that God loves you for  being honest and true, not for faking heterosexuality.    We talk about how their parents are going to take it.  And here is where I slow it down.  I think that parents that don't love their children because they are gay are bleepin' idiots, but I know that its a slow process for them as well.  I tell kids that telling your parents is a coming out process for them as well and it may take time for them to understand it.  I also caution about safety and making sure its the right time to tell them.  One of my girls got caught the summer after her freshman year in college in bed with her girlfriend by her mom.  Not the best way to tell them.  Interestingly, a gay male student waited a long time to tell his parents that he was gay, even though his two older sisters had come out when they were in high school.  This young man was a competetive figure skater--his parents must have had some inkling.    I will say I wonder if the parents know and just can't admit it.  But maybe they don't.  I have a girl right now who is fianlly admitting to herself that she might be gay.  And its killing her because her folks, whom she adores, are not going to take it well.  At all.  They are very conservative and see homosexuality as both disgusting and wrong.  Its going to be a long road for all of them.  I was talking to my mom about this when I was home last and she was saying, why wasn't there someone like me when I was in high school that I could have talked to about all my problems?  Excellent question, mom.  And that is why I put up with all the awful parents and the boring bits and the drama.  Because I want every kid out there that needs someone to listen to know I am here.  And that I totally adore them.  Every damn one of them.

      I haven't blogged much of late.  I think its the summer and being away from a desk all the time.  I had thought, in the beginning of the summer,  that I would post like mad.   That I would tell all the tales of my youth, not so youthy youth and recent unyouth.  But I really haven't.  The stories are there, don't get me wrong, but there is something about the sun shining that doesn't bring out the writer in me.  I need a good crappy day.  I am starting to look wistfully at fall.  I miss Sundays in the fall when football is on all day and I sit around reading the NYTimes( I save the book review and the magazine for last because those are my favorite). All I have really been doing is hanging out wtih G$ and talking about redoing his room.  Its a little young for him as he enters the pre-adolescent phase and I think its time for him to go to the next level of bed (in his case that means a double bed from a twin with a slide).  One of the things that Shaolin rides my ass about is that I will tell G$ that he can pick what he wants for colors and pictures and then tell him his choice is wrong.  Our conversation goes something like this: "You want what one?" 'That one." "That one?" "Yeah." "But Gryphon, thats...well its just...are you sure you don't want this one?"  You get the picture.  I want him to choose but of course I want him to choose right.  Which isn't totally fair I suppose. But then my mom wouldn't let me paint my walls black when I thought it was the coolest thing ever, so maybe its a right of passage.   I am letting him pick 20 comic book covers that he loves and scanning them so that I can go down to Kinkos and print them up all sexy and put them in cool cheap Ikea frames all around his room.  So I am not heartless.  I didn't even complain that he picked 6 Fantastic Four covers.  Six.    So other than wandering around the house looking at all the things I should clean, I haven't been up to all that much.    **************************  I think that I am going to give an end of the year summer BBQ.  Just open up the house to all and buy a lot of ice.  It will be a good way to determine whether I am pleased that it is all ending.  Its one of those times where I wish I had a huge expanse of lawn so that people could lay in the twilight and drink.   **************************   I am already dreading the parents that are going to yell at me when school starts.  This is clearly going to be one of those years that is all about focusing on that time in the distance when things mellow out and the college app process picks up.  I look at some kids schedules already and cringe that there is going to be some screaming.    **************************  Movies I would like to have lived in:  Philadelphia Story Ocean's Eleven Replacement Killers Real Genius  Unfortunately, in all of them, I would want to be the guy. What does that mean?

      Ok, I don't know that they all smell nice.&nbsp; But I like to think they do.&nbsp;  More importantly, I want you to ask yourself:&nbsp; Do you have a dream bathroom?&nbsp; A spare-no-expense perfect bathroom?&nbsp; I thought I did.&nbsp; I thought it had a huge claw-footed tub where the tap was in the middle and there were nice marble sinks that were roomy and warm and kind of Restoration Hardware-esque.  &nbsp;  But I was wrong.&nbsp; I was in Cody's the other day looking at pictures of fantasy rooms, all far too anaseptic for my taste, when I saw this small book called  Japanese Bathrooms .&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Inside were all these traditional Japanese baths that were wood lined and slightly dim, they were rooms in perpetual sunset.&nbsp; Big square wood tubs with little platforms for rinsing off.&nbsp; Beautiful plants and open windows (less appealing in a neighborhood with a lot of foot traffic), they just made&nbsp;me sigh and relax a little.&nbsp; There were nice little Asian women leaning back as they relaxed in the warm tranquil water, that could totally be me.&nbsp; Just two feet taller and white.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was great.&nbsp; I want one now.  &nbsp;  So that's my dream bathroom.&nbsp;

      You know how people send you links that you never open because they suck ass and maybe you have one friend that always send you the best shit ever? The kind of links that connect you to the power cosmic?   I looked at this site and thought, "God Bless America."    urlLink http://www.uglydress.com/index.html    Pay particular attention to the teal bridesmaid dress that matched the groom's Camaro.

      Well, we are back.  Hopefully at least some of you checked us out on John's site.  There are some great pics and more to come.  Hopefully *not* the one of me peeing on the side of the road (Why does this fascinate men?  Why?).  I am sure that I should blog about my trip at length later, but it is sure nice to be home.  In a house that's much much larger than a camper.   Now I need to go do a crap load of laundry. Peace.

      We have our rules set. We have our "wheel of drinks" made. The CD mixes have been burned. We bought enough beef jerkey in case the bad shit goes down.  (Remember Red Dawn?  WOLVERINES!!) I packed extra clean socks and Neosporin.  Jamie, John and I are leaving tomorrow to see the world.  Or at least Utah.  You can follow our fearless voyage @   jdonohoe.buzznet.com.  Peace be with all of you.  --Jake

      Ok.  Both Shaolin and Marc have been on my ass about not posting--and I must admit, I haven't felt especially profound of late.  But I did spend a few minutes this morning (after I made pasta salad and rice crispy treats) thinking about the difference between new friends and old friends.  Are there fundamental differences between new friends and old friends?  For the sake of my argument, we are going to call new friends anyone that I met and got close to post college and the old friends the ones that I knew in high school and college (the embarrassing years).  Now I don't really think the way that I choose and keep friends has changed all the much, so, by in large, they are similar types of people.  The reason I think this is true is that my old friends and new friends would cross pollinate quite well, I think.    Old Friends These are the people that knew me back in the day.  They have seen me do all kinds of things that I would love to think never happened.  They saw me do back flips off a diving board in nothing but cowboy boots at a cocktail party (it ruined the boots), they have seen me throw (and I do mean throw) myself at men that weren't interested.  They loved me with black hair.  Red hair.  Platinum hair. Big 80s hair.  No hair.  They took a lot of drugs with me.  They had a lot of sex with me.  I think you get the picture. They are the ones that call you on your shit when you make claims about your past that are...well...more metaphorically true than anything else.  I am completely clear that these people love me unconditionally.  And thank God for that.  But these are also the friends that are the most pigeon-holing.  The ones that assume that I am the same as I was in college, that I have the same motivations as I did then.  These are the people that can always bring up those parts of me that I would prefer fade into the landscape of the past.  And lets be honest, I do the same with them.  I struggle with remembering that all the stupid things my friends did were, for the most part, 15 years ago.  Can you really hold them accountable still?  New Friends Ah, new friends.  The ones that you get to make when you finally have most of your shit together.  I have good adult relationships with these people and there is none of that baggage following the relationship along.  Someone that you can choose to edit your past with.  Not lie, but not expose all the stupid stuff that you would like to let go of.  These are the friendships with the good boundaries. These are the ones that are "healthy".  Certainly less intense, but maybe in a good way sometimes.  There is something easy about these relationships.  Maybe that is because your point of context is less lengthy.  Your history is smooth.    But they haven't seen you at your worst.  And I am not sure that I am willing to show them that.  These are not the people that know me and love me unconditionally (except Shaolin--she loves me unconditionally).  They might if I asked them to, but there is no safety in that.  These are not the people I would call when I just did the worst thing ever and need to tell someone about it.  These are the people I explore the new parts of who I want to be with, the SuperMe, not who I was or even, sometimes, who I am.  So what do you do with that.  Is there any big point to be made?  I guess I would like to know whether you can have both.  I want to think you can.  I think people read this and think "of course, you can!"  But can you?  Really?  Isn't there a saturation point in all relationships that you can never transcend?    With that little slice of my brain--- I'm leaving Tuesday on a road trip with my boys.  We are taking an RV to Vegas, Utah and Tahoe.  As we speak, John is making a playing cards that illustrate some of the 30 or so rules that are in play from the time we leave Manhattan Beach.  We have rules that cover drinking, apparel, music choices, driving duties, what you can and can't do in the *one* bathroom and food choices.  Our first stop is Vegas and I am worried we may never leave.

      Just got back from going to MB to see the parental units with their grandchild.  My mother had said that she wanted to camp out in the backyard with him Saturday night which I think was her way of saying that it would be a kids focused weekend.  Which means that my parents would not get drunk and listen to jazz at high, old people volume.  I was wary.  Now, lets be clear--my parents are very cute drunks.  They aren't mean or oogie.  They are just loud.  Loud at 2am loud.  When you're trying to sleep.   It can be frustrating.    But as it was, they were sober all weekend.  We took Gryphon to the SM pier to eat cotton candy and beat my dad at air hockey.  I taught him the basics of boogie boarding and that kept him busy for a few hours.  My mom and I went to the biggest Joann's ever and I bought a bunch of garish fabric.  We had a great time.  I even got to spend fun reminiscing time with my mom and brother about all the commune freakos they hung out.  My uncle Raul with all his hot, cocaine skinny girlfriends, my broken uncle Dan that got horribly scarred by Agent Orange in the 70s and never seemed quite right afterwards, and my uncle Gabby, who my brother Che reminded me, used to always pee with door open.  And then, when he saw you standing there, grossed out, he would greet you like he was getting a beer from the fridge.  All of them naked in the hot tub in Gabby & Sue's backyard.    I am not sure what other families tell stories about, but mine always seem to start off with beer and something gets broken.  But we had a really good time and it was really nice to see my stoner brother and his endlessly patient girlfriend.  It was fun to watch a lot of TV and eat a lot of meat.  I have a really nice, though a wee bit strange family.  God, I love them.    There were some kooky bits. This morning at 7:30, I snuck out of the folk's house to get a real cup of coffee (my parents use Folgers) and  I saw 30 or so people standing around a few cafes looking lost.  Apparently, MB had a power outage that made the water undrinkable for 48 hours.  So no cafes could make coffee and people were sort of dazed.  The barristas were slowly explaining to people how to get coffee in HB and that it was only 5 minutes away, but people were a little slow on the uptake.    Driving the 5 down and back, I saw some strange things in people's cars.  One woman had her dog in the backseat, but the dog was wearing full goggles.  With two straps around each ear, they looked like he wore them all the time.  I thought that was a little strange.  And since Shaolin told me that the windmills on Altamount Pass destroy birds like lettuce, I was looking for little bird carnage the whole way over the hill.  Grossed out, but oddly transfixed.

      I think that y'all should take a moment to observe that while the rest of the country is in the security land of Bert; in NYC, its Ernie.  Ain't it the truth.  So I cut all my hair off.  Well, I cut most of my hair off.  Around 11 inches to be exact. I have the curly version of the 70's surf cut.  But I use more hair product.   I worried that I was going to have impulse remorse.  That I was going to come back after the haircut screaming and saying "Two years.  I grew it out for TWO YEARS!"  But I don't.  I love that I don't have to move it when I lay down.  I love that its not touching my neck in that creepy way that makes me think I am being followed.  I love that I no longer need to carry rubber band around my wrist everywear I go.  God bless my hairdresser for not making me get in between length hair to make sure I was ready.   I think I look saucy.    Alysse is a saint.  She took me under her shopping wing and helped me find black pants.  I am not a good shopper, but she is a great shopper who guided me through the scariest parts of Union Square with an authoritative aplomb that I am envious of.  I had been bitching that I was trying on all these pants and they all made me look like that roll of cookie dough before you unwrap it to make tasty cookies.   I bought two pairs of black pants and a lovely grey dress shirt all under her watchful gaze.  The great thing about Alysse is that while I will simply buy pants to be able to get the hell out of the store, Alysse will not buy anything that doesn't look great on her.  Think about that for a minute.  How many things have you bought simply because they seemed good conceptually?  Or you saw them on someone else and they looked great?  It took me a long time to get my head around the basic principle that everything looks great in a size two and that I need to see it in my size.     We even got to look at the  dept store windows and titter at all the ponchos. I pooped out after a few hours, but she just walked me to BART and then went back into the fray.    I might be almost ready to go back to school.  I just want to find a new lunchbox to go with my back-to-school clothes and I suppose I'm ready.
