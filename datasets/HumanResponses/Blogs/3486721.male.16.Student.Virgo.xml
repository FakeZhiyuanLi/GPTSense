      I was thinking about Bali today. And i realized how much fucking fun it will be. Not only chilling out with friends that are leaving, but Bali itself! Last time i had a fucking blast, and this time it will for sure be fucking fun, probably so much fun that I will end up going again in October!  urlLink    This picture reminds me of the good times of relaxing after spending about 2 hours with George doing jackass stunts off the side of the beach!&nbsp; urlLink

      So me and Niklas were just at the mall, after him buying that crappy Xbox, and he got a call from his dad saying that he has bought a new car. WOW. BMW Z3. Part from that his daid walked in and started talking and watching TV with us. Awsome. I nearly made him give me 100kr! (by telling him that if he gave me 100kr, then I'll invest it and buy him a better car)    		  	 Larry, the funny ass dad

      Today as I woke up i looked out, and YES the weather is finally  good ! The sun has stopped hididing and now I can go  partying  at the islands with my friends. Apart from that, I have to go to the  doctors , take a lot of tests (including a urine test =S).  I'll pass all of them . Apart from that I'm hoping that all these damn grey rain clouds will go away and  let the sun appear for longer !

      Today I had a nice trip which was cut down from 1h 30m to just 10 minutes as I fell asleep right away after getting into the car. The night before I had stayed at Niklas's and we had stayed up all night watching movies cause  the weather was shit  so there was nothing else to do. All movies were good apart from one shitty one called " Dahmer " or something similar to that. I have never seen a movie so boring and so homeosexual as that in my whole life.  FUCK IT! . Pointless piece of crap!     Anyways. I had a boring day since I had to go to Falkenberg to see my grandma (who turned 70) and my other cousins, who all look the same and are still as  boring  as they always are!  Good thing I have FIFA 2004 on my phone =)!

         Look at that shitty weather!  Why does the weather have to be so crap on the day that I will be going to Klippan for a party?! Oh well, hopefully me and the others still end up going to go find some people to chill with and drink beer. Niklas's dad bought fucking 30 crates of beer when he was in Holland and he is letting us have 5!  So that is 5 x 20 = 100 cans to drink!  Tonight should be great, if we till end up going.  Lets just hope the weather gets better!

       Damn . Sweden is fucking nice; alot nicer than I had expected this time. My friends have stopped smoking and they have stayed off the drugs and are starting to become more friendly than they were last year: when i would call them " fuck heads " and they would start swearing back. I mean  what is wrong with being a fuck head?!   (many reasons why, I just can't be arsed to state them all.      All of us + Niklas's dad who just decided to jump in and join us in the jacuzzi to start argueuing about gay rights. Weird Subject. Our final conclusion:  We have nothing against them !  While you are in your own places enjoying the sun, I'll still be in Sweden catching up on old times with mates and teaching them to play football; since none of them can!

      Finally  I'm back  :S. It was good, but there are basically  no one here  apart from omar and some other people. Soon I'll be a loner :(. On the last day of my stay in Sweden I met up with  Rebecca and her hot friend  at an amuesment park: Liseberg. Had shit loads of fun and got pics with it. We ate at a  Eat all You want for 70kr  restauraunt.  GOD DAMN I WAS FULL  after just 2 slices of Pizza. Then we decided to queue up for about 40 minutes just to ride this roller coaster called  Balder ; it was alright. Then snice we were tired we went on a 3D cinema show; where  we were given glasses that look like my mums  haha. During the day we rode many rides! When we got back me and Niklas finished a  whole crate of beer  during the night and watched Camp Jim while cracking up to that gay show. Oh and  his parents walked into the house piss drunk ; after having  drunken shit loads  at the neigbours house!    Robin and the hot girl Rebecca brought with her. And her brother.   The resauraunt where i only ate 2 slices.   After winning an ugly monkey.  	 On the wildest ride ever. Literally. I thought it was damn good, but I won't ever show you the pic of the ride; its embarassing!  	 Oh shit! Pretend you never saw that!   Cool dudes.  	 Rebecca about the leave.   Niklas on the way home.  	 Niklas being a fag and taking photos of himself.   Preparing to drink a crate of beer, after already having 5 cans. ( hence the red eyes )
