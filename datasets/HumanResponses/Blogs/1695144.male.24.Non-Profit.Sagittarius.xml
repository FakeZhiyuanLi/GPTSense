      So Where does new life begin? Where does old life end? Have you died my friend? No?  But die you must for death visits us all First find a place to rest  I do not know where I will rest but God leads me in my search my journey from beloved to beloved lover  Why? I asked myself would God ever want me to act selfishly? Yet strife for eternal life summarizes my last 24 years  Now I only pray that the love God so perfectly embraces me with I can hold creation in

      Finally, after so much time in solitude I realize I was never really alone always accompanied by myself and my own desires never overcoming to dive into the true solitude of everyone of coexisting so as to cease being an individual and therefore to be truly alone the solitude I hated was really my own self worship not the solitude of love

      1.  For about 1 year.  I have a deep desire to grow in my faith.  JVC recommendations from Karen and I am very interested in JVC.    2.  Foreign Languages Day - more stressful than I ever anticipated.  Additional work and responsibilities I was unaware of at the last minute + other responsibilities before graduation.  I tried to spend more time relaxing and I made sure I obtained the help of those who were in a position to support me.  Everyone was better prepared for the event.  It was a success.  3.  Going to college was a major change for me.  I didn't realize it until I was there.  Learning about my family and how to communicate with them and use them as a support system has been very important.  4.  I am a 5.  I respect religious traditions and institutions but I am still exploring what my spiritual life means to me and how I will choose to live it.  5.  VMM retreat in Guatemala (offering the Eucharist service).  I am involved in singing, lector, reading groups and social events.  6.  Yes. My best friends and I continually talk about our faith and what it means to us.  Actually, my closest friends from college are those whom I met through a church sponsored trip to El Salvador.  7. St. John's Parish ... I just arrived.  8.  Prayer, Daily Meditation, Masses, reading.  9.

      1.  Significant experiences in personal development.     a.  El Salvador Trip     b.  College     c.  Cappuchin retreats     d.  El Salvador volunteering      Persons who have greatly affected my life - Father and mother in terms of how I can treat everyone as God's children - story of them picking up a hitchhiker.     Especially difficult experiences I have dealt with by being honest and taking the time to listen, reflect and grow.  2.  The thing I value most about living in community is the sustainable model for a fulfilling life that it provides.  I believe that living in a JVC community includes a full time commitment to all those who are participating in the community.  This means that we will each have more responsibilities than those entailed in our job descriptions.  We will be their to support one another and help each other keep our committments of the JVC NW covenant.  3.  I currently consider the group I live with to be my community.  We are a close group of people who hope to grow together as we share a living space together.  I went out of my way to pick up a video camera for my brother.  I felt like it was not a bad thing because we are all willing to do the same and only expect of others what we try to give them ourselves.  4.  No.No.  5.  Recently I was angered by a co-worker.  I told the person that it was impossible for me to try any harder.  The person simply became angrier.  I finally talked to our manager ... not knowing what the response would be.  It was very positive.  I one time hurt a resident as an RA without knowing it.  Tracy story.  6.  Tracy  7.  Only Zoloft  8.  My parents and relationship I shouldn't have been a part of.  9.  I found challenging, and I believe will also find challenging ... the committment to overcome selfish concerns as to live better in community.  Thomas Merton.  No matter how hard one tries to do so ... it is difficult to do it for the right reasons and not for self idolization or gratification.  It is a point on which I will always continue to grow.

      1.  I am interested in all justice issues.  However, I have the greatest interest in those dealing with latino groups and with the environment.  I feel that I am particularly well suited for working with latino groups due to my experience living and working in Latin America.  Also, I believe that the environment is one place where God's presence is most often manifest to me.  My first trip to El Salvador as a college freshman truly awakened these interests.  2.  I believe that the foundation of my faith as a Catholic calls me to work for social justice.  Jesus' entire ministry was reaching out to those who are excluded and marginalized by society.  Whether it was the social outcasts because of physical sickness or disability (such as the leper or the blind) or due to unpopular life circumstances (such as tax collectors and prostitutes).  Jesus of a kind of justice that unlike our legal justice, always rules to rule in the interest of all living things in creation.  3.  The most profound experiences I have had recently working with poor and marginalized peoples was while I was living in El Salvador.  The most difficult thing for me was realizing that everything I did was optional while those I worked with had not choice but to live in the conditions in which they found themselves.  It was also extremely painful to translate for survivors of massacres as they spoke of the loss of their loved ones.  I gained the most hope from the ability of the people to continue forward and be enthusiastic about changed ... even though it has been a long time without coming still.  I learned that I need to live in community to be happy and healthy and that I will always remain dedicated to the poor and margenalized.  I learned that the people I worked with often do not fit a preconceived mold.  I learned that God is beautiful and works in mysterious ways.  4.  I used to think the poor were always right, just because they were poor and therefore, the closest to the problem.  However, I had an experience translating for a rural Salvadoran woman, who for political reasons, had refused to join part of a water improvement project, believing it was going to cause a later privitization.  I later found her allegations were untrue ... although not unfounded based on other experiences in other parts of the coutry.  Yet, the reason that such a position was taken immediately had to do with the leftist party's policy decisions.  This made me realize that while it is important to respect the opinions of all marginalized people ... it is also critical to be objective as to any task one must undertake in his or her job.  5.  For me, the most challenging and enlightening thing is to be like the father of the parable of the prodigal son.  The father, unlike those who complained in the vineyard, or the younger son, simply act upon a pure, complete love.  This is the love of God.  It is so difficult for me to love others in that way, especially my enemies.  But I must realize that even those disagree with are son and daughters of the one God and must be respected and loved.  From the reading I believe the most personally enlightening and challenging suggestion is to uncover the darkness in life and find a way to deal with it.  I am still trying to find how to deal withe darkness I uncovered in El Salvador.
