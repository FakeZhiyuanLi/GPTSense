      Well my plan of not being on the computer to much lately seems to be working well as i have not updated my blog in about 2 days i think, well thats partly because i have not been on the computer and partly because i have nothing intresting to write about but im sure something will come to me, well first off ill start with my acknoweldgement of the day and that is 'i miss being at school' yes i actually am quite surprised to admit i miss the old building, the old teachers and the old same routine i used to have, i have grown bored of sitting round the house and not seeing my close compadries and maybe this will all change when i actually get a job and have a new routine to follow.....hopefully. hmmmmmmm what else can i write in my new beautiful post, let me think..................oh yes, i am becoming that desperat for a job that McDonalds is looking mildly intresting to me, yes i now i to am fearing for my sanity but i blame mother as she's always on my case oh and lets not forget papa he plays a big part in my moaning at too, and i do think it is mean to gang up on there own flesh and blood!!! Evil i say, and as always i say 'i will get a job when im good and ready' which is true and when i can be bothered getting ready and getting out of the house and looking for one of course. Again i shall leave my blog here at this moment in time and search the net for a job vaccancie. good bye's.

      Well today has been extremally boring, got the usual lecture of why havnt you got a job? and again i replied 'all in good time mamma and papa' but were they happy with this answer? i think not! They tell me to take anything i can get.....and i will with in reason, i have got a brain so i believe i can do better than some places like picking up the litter on the road and other stuff id just rather not do thanx. I have also realised my blog isnt the most intresting of blogs, far from it actually, but then again i use it just a s a diary for me and if other people choose to read it then that is fine but if they say it isnt intresting i already know so please keep them kind of comments to yourself but any others with mere revalence are welcome. I still believe i am spending to much time on msn and have began to limit myself to a few hours each day, hopefully in theese few hours each night i can update my blog with my random thoughts or aims for the day but again i am signing off for tonight. Farewell and God bless.......believe me if i had a good quote to put here i wud....so at least you now know it was in my thoughts.

      During the course of the day i have learned the word 'love' is beginning to loose its special meaning and people use it too frequently without real care for the word, i am only 16 and do believe i have never been in love yet, yes i have LIKED people alot but love at 16.....i think not, and others that believe they are in love already are most likely just in a crush stage! Yes there are the special people who do fall in love at 16 and get married and live happily ever after but seriously i dont think the percentage of this happening is very high, good luck if you believe you are in love at this age and i hope it does work out, i am only giving my personal view that the word has lost its special touch and is becomming less meaningfull.

      So here i am again at my coputer with little else to do, so i have decided to turn up my music and do another post, again i say i do not know what to write about really! but hopefully inspuration will come to me...........hmmm or maybe it wont. I will add though that i believe msn is evil, i spend a little to many hours of my life on it talking to people i know and people who r just added through friends. As much as i love my dear msn messenger it will end up turning me in to a lazy fat little lady who sits at her coputer all day with nothing better to do. I should so as my mother and papa says and go out and get a job but it becomes fustrating and i really believe people should come looking for me, not that im anything specail just it would be alot easier for me that way. Again i shall leave and post again later

      Well from the title of my post you may guess i dont really know what to start talkin about, but i shall try and think of something, but unlike some i just cant write down how im feeling, whats happened to me and so forth and so on it just doesnt come out right and i usually end up confusing myself as well as others, and i usually just give up as soon as i start but i just thought, hey ill give it a go! So here goes, im a usual girl i like shopping and lookin at the cutest boy going my way, i have never had a bad relationship or anything really traumatic happen to me (so far) so im not angry with life or anyone at the moment and i just believe everything does happen for a reason, even the bad things in life. I have a close group of 4 friends who id do anything for and believe they would do anything for me to, i also have many more 'aqauintences' lets say who i like but know most of the girls are probably bitchin behind my back, as it is what most girls live to do for some reason unkown to me, ive finnaly finshed high school now and begin college in september, personally i cant wait to go as i think it will be more relaxed and less boring as highschool was, dont get me wrong i loved highschool at the time but towards the end of may i belived it was the right time to be leaving it as grew tiring, and seemed to be repeating itself again and again, anyway im going to leave this post as it is and will make sure i post more in the near future.
