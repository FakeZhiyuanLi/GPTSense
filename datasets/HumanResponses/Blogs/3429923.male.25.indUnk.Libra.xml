          Yesterday I began  what I hope will become a very in-depth study of the book of Hebrews with two  guys from my church.&nbsp; We had a great discussion digging into the big  picture concepts behind the book and trying to pick out the key passages that  will be critical to our understanding of what we are  reading.         &nbsp;     After we talked, I  have thought more and more about our "evangelical" approach to the Bible.&nbsp;  I think we, and I include myself when talking about evangelicals, are an awfully  conflicted bunch.&nbsp; On the one hand, we want to lift up the Bible as the  only standard for life and our only tangible revelation of God today.&nbsp; On  the other hand, we want to take this ancient and lofty book and treat it as if  it was as easy to understand as a children's story.&nbsp; We want the  seriousness and importance while desiring simplicity at the same  time.         &nbsp;     I wonder if this is  more of a North&nbsp;American phenomenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evangelicals around the  world may not share that very American pragmatism that has infected the  conservative church in the USA.&nbsp; I could be wrong, but I think we bring the  same attitude to Scripture that we would to the newspaper, magazines, or even  larger works of literature.&nbsp; We want Cliff's Notes, not the real  deal.&nbsp; It is just so practical to simplify, or at least believe that you  can simplify, all things, including God and his revelation so that everyone can  understand.         &nbsp;     Yet, as we began to  debate the larger themes of Hebrews yesterday,&nbsp;and as I reflected on its  relevance to my life, I was struck by how complex God is at all times and in  every way.&nbsp; Who are we, as 21st century evangelicals, to wrap him up so  neatly.&nbsp; We take this ancient document, the Bible, which we believe to be  the very words God has given to man, and we put together tidy outlines and  simple 3 point sermons to apply it to our lives.&nbsp; We may&nbsp;have "6 Steps  to Spiritual Success," and "7 Habits of Highly Effective Christians," and "3  Keys to Overcoming Our Fears," but we lose a vision of the awesome power and  character of the holy God we are listening to through the  Bible.         &nbsp;     I think clear and  concise sermons are a must, and every preacher better organize their thoughts  into some kind of outline, but in the midst of that, they must also hold up the  mystery that is God's word.&nbsp; How can I understand?&nbsp; How can I pretend  to have all the answers?&nbsp; How can such a small group of Christians,  American evangelicals, believe that we, in the grand scope of history, are the  ones who got it figured out and simplified to fit into our busy  lives?         &nbsp;     May we always have  the humility to say "your thoughts are not our thoughts, and your ways are not  our ways."&nbsp; God is mystery, as is so much in his Word, but the real miracle  is that he bridged the gap between mystery and our reality to meet us  here.&nbsp; I hope I will grow every day in my experience of that mystery and  the humility that says I can't figure it all out, but I believe  nonetheless.

          This is a useless  piece of information, but something I just discovered this  week.         &nbsp;     You can make  Microsoft Excel talk by using the "Text to Speech".&nbsp; Go to View / Toolbars  / Text to Speech and you get the controls.&nbsp; Anything you type into a cell  can be spoken back to you in a very "Hal" or Stephen Hawking type of  voice.         &nbsp;     While it may be  stupid, it can be a nice diversion during a stressful day.&nbsp;  Enjoy.

          I found a great new  site in step with the themes of the emergent church  http://www.the-next-wave.org/ .&nbsp;  It's worth checking out.&nbsp; Especially good today was an interview with one  of the leaders of a new church in the San Diego area talking about a "missional  community" and what their fellowship looks like ( http://www.the-next-wave.org/stories/storyReader$297 ).&nbsp;           &nbsp;     Anyway, it seems  like a cool place and one I'll be back to again.&nbsp; One last thing to check  out on the site is the links on the top right to the daily prayers and  devotionals of the Catholic church.&nbsp; Even if you're not catholic, the  material for focused times of prayer and mediation could be  valuable.

      This is my first attempt at blogging.  Thought it might be fun and a good exercise in self-expression.  Anyway, I'll have more up soon.
