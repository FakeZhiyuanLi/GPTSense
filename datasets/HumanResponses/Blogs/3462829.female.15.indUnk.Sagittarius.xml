      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [CHORUS:] When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating life Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [Chorus]  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along  [Chorus]

      hey.. sometimes do u ever wonder why the fuck people talk about u when they really dont give a shit about u or what u do they just want to try to make ur life a livin hell yeah that is what is fucking gay.. people dont know shit about u or ur life.. but they want to make bull shit comments anyway.. so if u only have a couple of true friends why should u care about what anyone else thinks or does.. people are so fucked up these days.. they cant stop and think about what is really goin on in their life.. but they have to be in someone elses.. if u hate someone so much then why do u talk about them.. or do shit that reminds u of them.. why should u really care.. sometimes i just wanna give up everything and not worry about all this shit anymore.. but i realized that that will be stupid and selfish.. and people need to learn that people CAN change.. but their heads are so far up there ass or their b/f's to realize that!!

      if they have to comment on my blog and sign anonymous instead of coming to my face and sayin it then that is what is gay.. i dont care if people comment on my blog i really dont give a shit what people think about me.. yeah i used to but now i dont give a damn cause it isnt affecting me.. if someone hates someone so0o much and think their blog is so gay why the fuck do u read it stupid ass people!! its not that hard to stay out of someones life that they hate!! but i dont really care do whatever the fuck u want your just wasting ur time making comments about someone u hate

      Usher Confessions (Interlude) [Usher talking on phone]Hello? Yo I'm in the booth  I'mma call you right back Nah I just gotta put this one part down  I'mma call you back I'm at the studio man  what--Man quit playin' with me man No for real don't play like that Are you--are you serious? How you know? Put that on everything. DamnI'mma call u back I'mma call u back... [Intro]Everytime I was in L.A. I was with my ex-girlfriend Everytime you called I told you, "Baby I'm workin." (No!) I was out doin my dirt (Oh!) Wasn't thinkin' 'bout you gettin' hurt(I)  was hand in hand in the Beverly Center like man Not givin' a damn who sees me So gone (I know)So wrong (Just listen) Thinkin' I got it and left you sittin' at home Thinkin' about me Bein' a good girl that you are But you prolly believe you got a good man I man that never would do the things  I'm about to tell you  I've done Brace yourself It ain't good But it would be even worse  if you heard this from somebody else (oh no) [Usher speaking]I know you hate me I know I hurt you But there's more listen... Watch this... [Chorus:] These are my confessions Just when I thought I said all I can say My chick on the side said she got one on the way These are my confessions Man I'm thrown and I dont know what to do I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all Damn near cried when I got that phone call I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do But to give you part 2 of my confessions [Verse 1] Now this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do Got me talkin' to myself askin' how I'm gon' tell you' bout that chick on part 1 I told ya'll I was creepin' with, creepin' with Said she's 3 months pregnant and she's keepin' it The first thing that came to mind was you Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true Third thing was me wishin' that I never did what I did [Chorus] [Verse 2] Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth Said it ain't gon' be easy But I need to stop thinkin',  contemplatin'Be a man and get it over with (over with) I'm ridin' in my whip Racin' to her place Talkin' to myself Preparin' to tell her to her face She open up the door and didn't want to come near me I said "one second baby please hear me" [Chorus] [Breakdown] This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do To tell you, the woman I love That I'm having a baby by a woman that I barely even know I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this And hopefully you'll give me another chance This ain't about my career This ain't about my life It's about us  Please [Chorus]

      hateful hearts, abusive hands someones spirt is torn apart a pretty face, a perfect place only she knows what it takes a beautiful dove, a smile full of love all she needs is a friendly hug bleeding tears, a hurting soul she's all alone freezing in the cold bright lights, painful needles only ONE person stands there with her  as she lies in the hospital  brusies,cuts, a few broken ribs but not as painful as the heart she fears.                          *amanda*
