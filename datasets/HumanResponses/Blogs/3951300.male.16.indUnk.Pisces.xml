      I was with my mom riding to the store one night when I saw a guy, shabbily clothed and long dirty hair with a cap on to cover the top, and he was about to get on his bike, and I watched him as my mom was pulling in and he was putting his bags of food in his baskets located on the front and back of his bike and he was making sure everything was just right, and I felt a sadness dwelling in me, I felt his pain of no one knowing he even existed, everyone in their nice cozy vehicles passing him by as he tried desperately just to make sure he wouldn’t lose anything upon his journey to his home or wherever he was going for that night. I think it is so sad that we Christians can be so Holy and so pure but we can’t even stop to help someone who isn’t so holy and so pure, and some times it makes me mad to know that we can go spend money to read our nice Christian books by great Christian authors but we can’t even help someone who is tying bags to the rails of his baskets, so that on a bike ride home they will be safe. I think we American Christians have forgot the values of Christianity, I think we have forgot what Christianity is and why we are called Christians, and as we pop the trunks of cars to put in our nice good neatly packed groceries, we forget the guy on the bike is taking 15 minutes just to make sure he can keep his safe, because he can’t lose anything, because when he loses something it may cost him more than just money it make cost him 3 or 4 maybe even 5 meals that were suppose to last him through the week. So go and live your American Christian lives the way you want, but I choose to live mine like Jesus, because Christianity is about being like him, not like Billy Bob or sally sue.  May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd

      Well I really love this story, it's one of my favorite's, so I hope you enjoy as well...  I remember, you know, you go to these parties on Saturday night and people would say, about 8:00 on Sunday morning "Whoa, I have to go - I gotta get to church!" People would say, "Why do you want to go to church, all those hypocrites." And I say, "Look, why do I want to stay here with all you hypocrites?" (audience laughter) I never knew why going to church made you a hypocrite. They'd say because you go to church and you're all "Holy, Holy, Holy" for two or three hours, and then you go home and sin. I'd say "exactly!" (audience laughter) For two or three hours you're doing pretty good! (audience laughter) Maybe the problem isn't that you go to church, maybe the problem is that you go home!  I never understood why going to church made you a hypocrite either, because nobody goes to church because they're perfect. If you've got it all together, you don't need to go. You can go jogging with all the other perfect people on Sunday morning (audience laughter). Every time you go to church, you're confessing again to yourself, to your family, to the people you pass on the way there, to the people who will greet you there, that you don't have it all together. And that you need their support. You need their direction. You need some accountability, you need some help.  Saying someone is a hypocrite is such a sore thing to say. It's kind of like saying they're human. We know there are people who think better of us than we know they have reason to. Funny thing about the whole thing. I love the story about Jesus calling Nathaniel. I think it's so funny. That he calls him and he says, "O behold an Israelite in whom there is nothing false." And Nathaniel, I love this, because he's like "Oh, how did you know me?" And Jesus said "Look, before you ever saw me, while you were still sitting under a fig tree, I saw you." And Nathaniel, who had so casually met the Lord, suddenly was crushed by the knowledge that God has of him.  I think it's funny that when Adam and Eve sinned, they covered themselves with a couple fig leaves. Then Nathaniel, who I think the Lord said sarcastically "O behold an Israelite in whom there is nothing false," he was sitting under a whole tree of those leaves. I think we all do that too. And we have reason to. If you knew what I was really like, you wouldn't pay to be here. I'd have to go out and get a real job (audience laughter).  The thing that's so funny about all that though, is that God does see us as we are. And you can't fool Him. And what's even funnier - you know the story about Jesus and the rich young ruler? I love that story. And you know what I think is really funny is that in all three of the synoptic Gospels, that story immediately follow the story of Jesus blessing the children, which I think is a hysterical story, because you think about the apostles and how they're good Hebrews and they're good monotheists and they're probably really struggling with the idea that God can become flesh. Lucky for Jesus they weren't Greeks - they never would have bought that.  They finally begin to get a hold of, they get a grasp that maybe God can become flesh and dwell among us, maybe God can be a man, and then they come back and not only is God a man, but He's acting like an idiot! He's hanging out with a bunch of kids. He's blessing them, you know, and you think "How do you bless children?" Well, the best way I know is that you pick them up and you just throw them as high as you can, and you catch them right before they splatter (audience laughter). You get down on all fours and you run around the room and you let them ride you and you buck them off. You beard them. You put your mouth against their bellies and you make funny noises. Here's Jesus probably doing all this business.  His disciples were humiliated! And they said "You should not be making such a fool of yourself!" And I love this, Jesus says, "Here, look, look fellas. I'll call the shots here. I may be dumb, but I am God. And I'll tell you what else, if you wanna come into my kingdom, you'll come in like one of these or you won't come in at all." What is remarkable is that in all three synoptic Gospels, the rich young ruler comes up immediately afterwards and asks the stupidest question in the Bible, which American Christians in the twentieth century perpetually ask, and it's such a hack off. "Good Master, what must I do that I might have eternal life?" And the reason this is such a ridiculous question is because while this young ruler is coming up with this brilliant question for his big photo-op with the Master, the Master had already answered the question.  Jesus had just got done saying he must be like a child, or he cannot come into My kingdom. And this guy comes up and asks "what must I do?" It's not what you do. It's what you allow Christ to do. This young man was so arrogant that when God Himself spoke, he didn't bother to listen.  And here's the amazing thing in the Gospel of Mark, which you know is the briefest of the Gospels. And anytime you come across a detail in the book of Mark, take note of it, because he didn't waste time. He gives us three details that the other two synoptics leave out. He says this amazing thing - that Jesus looked at the man. Jesus, who was God, is so humble, that when this man, who was a mere mortal, who would like you and me someday be dead and no more, and would just stink up the ground for a while and then that's it. This man would not listen to God, but God is so humble that He took note of this man. He looked at him. And when God saw him, He loved him. And it was because God loved Him, I think, that He spoke.  Some of us are so afraid that God's not going to look at us. So we're out there doing all sorts of things to get God to take notice, but folks, God notices you. The fact is, He can't take His eyes off of you. However badly you think of yourself, God is crazy about you. God is in love with you. Some of us even fear that someday we'll do something so bad that He won't notice you anymore. Well let me tell you, God loves us completely. And He knew us at our worst before He ever began to love us at all. And in the love of God, there are no degrees, there is only love.  So tonight I'm going to say to you what the angels said to every character in the Bible that they encountered, except for Mary, the mother of Jesus. They said "Don't be afraid." We've got a little while to go yet in this life, and it's a scary thing, but don't be afraid. Be of good cheer. He has overcome the world. And He has chosen to dwell within us. And we ain't all that big a deal, but our Savior is. He will walk with us through this life, and when it's over, He will raise us up again, and take us to be where He is. Not because of what we've done, but because of who He is. Because of the love He has for us.  So go, and live in that awareness... love one another... read your Bible... wash your dishes... make your bed... and don't be afraid.   May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd

      Well I said I wasn't going to post I was just going to leave you with Rich Mullins, but tonight as I began to pray for my mother and her court case, I began to look up scriptures and all of a sudden I was becoming consumed with just trusting in God, and so I decided to post this hymn along with many, many scriptures that may be of help to you, they certainly are to me.  May God Bless you and Keep you, Bradley Floyd  I have decided to follow Jesus; (3x) No turning back, no turning back. The world behind me, the cross before me; (3x) No turning back, no turning back. Though none go with me, yet will I follow; (3x) No turning back, no turning back. Will you decide now to follow Jesus? (3x) No turning back, no turning back. From the song "I have decided to follow Jesus"(Composer unknown/Indian folk melody)   -----------------------Scriptures------------------------------------ The Anointing breaks every yoke ... and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.Isaiah 10:27   But Jesus looked at them and said to them, "With menthis is impossible, but with God all things are possible."Matthew 19:26   Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and youwill find; knock, and it will be opened to you.Matthew 7:7  ... casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.1 Peter 5:7  But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength;they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shallrun and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.Isaiah 40:31  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadowof death, I will fear no evil; for you are with me;Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.Psalm 23:4  Praise the Lord!

I am with you always, even to the end of the age.Matthew 28:20   If God is for us, who can be against us?Romans 8:31  Until now you have asked nothing in My name.Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.John 16:24  In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?Psalm 56:11  This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both secure andsteadfast, and which enters the Presence behind the veil.Hebrews 6:19  Oh taste and see that the Lord is good;Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!Psalm 34:8  Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.Lift up your heads, O you gates! Lift up, you everlasting doors! And the King of glory shall come in.Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah.Psalm 24:8-10  Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everyting.Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.Philippians 4:6 (New Living Translation)Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication,with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.Philippians 4:6 (New King James Version)  It shall come to pass in that day that his burden will be taken away from your shoulder,and his yoke from your neck, and the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.Isaiah 10:27   And Jesus came and spoke to them,saying, "All authority has beengiven to Me in heaven and on earth.Go therefore and make disciples ofall the nations, baptizing them inthe name of the Father and of theSon and of the Holy Spirit, teachingthem to observe all things that Ihave commanded you; and lo, I amwith you always, even to the endof the age." Amen.Matthew 28:18-20  Stand fast therefore in the liberty by whichChrist has made us free, and do not be entangledagain with a yoke of bondage.  I have Decided to follow Jesus, there is no turning back, I have decided to trust in Jesus, he will prevail, he will prevail!!! Put your Trust in Jesus, for he will prevail!!!- Bradley Floyd.

      Well I would just like to say that I have decided to take a break from my post and giveway to a great storyteller and singer Rich Mullins. Rich Mullins died in an automobile accident back in 1997. It was a loss to the Christian World. Rich Mullins is most familiar for his song "Awesome God" and&nbsp; "Elijah." The following is from a concert in 1996, I hope you will find time to read this, it's pretty funny. Anyway's God Bless...  I went to this church one time where they wanted me to dance. Those churches always scare me (audience laughter). That's why I so glad there are denominations. I think it's wonderful, if you want to dance that you can go to a church that does that, I just don't want you to do it at my church. We just like to sit still. Anyway, I went with a friend of mine. We got there, and everyone's dancing around, and I was doing my Hoosier thing (audience laughter). This lady came up and said "Dance brother, don't you have the Spirit?" And I went, "Wow, you know, I didn't realize that dancing was one of the fruits of the Spirit... or any of the gifts either. I didn't know that was the equivalent of being spiritually vital."  And she went, "Well, David danced."  And I said, "Well, right lady, in his underwear! How far do you want to take this?" (audience laughter) So I think dancing is fine for those of you who like to do it. The most reiterated command in the whole Bible - you might not know this, but the most reiterated command in the whole Bible is the command to sing.  So, I figure when you find a command that is easy to follow and fun to follow you should follow it a lot, because not all of them are that easy. And certainly some of them are less fun than that. So, in the effort to up your chances here tonight, we're going to ask you to sing. This is kind of a song about growing up in Indiana, but it's also kind of a song about living in the presence of the God who is eternal, and who doesn't change. If you want to sing this, please do.

      Well this is kind of a long entry, but it is worth the read... God Bless...   I remember one time, Beaker and I were hiking in the Appalachian trail and he met some friends of his and they all went in... (Rich immediately rewords himself)... they were all talking about school which I didn't want to talk about because I've been in school for so many years it's not interesting any more... (Rich pauses while audience laughs)... and uh, of course that happened after third grade... (more laughter from audience as Rich continues)... so I walked into town. It was about a five mile walk from the campsite down in... down the trail... down into town... and when I got there, I went in and was having a steak, and this guy started talking to me and we had this great conversation; we were having a good time and he said, "Hey look, it's dark and it's five miles up the road to your campground. Why don't I drive you up there?"  And I said, "Hey, great!"  And uh, so we got in his car and just as we pulled out from under the uh, last light in that town the guy said, "You know what, I should probably tell you that I'm gay."  And I said, "Oh! I should probably tell you that I am a Christian."  (audience applauds, but Rich continues...)  "...and Christians and gays are really a lot more alike than most people think."  And he said, "Well, what do you mean?"  And I said, "Well, I think that gay people are people who desperately need to be loved. And I think Christian people are pretty much the same."  (audience applauds loudly)  And he said, "Well if you want out of the car..."  I said, "Why?"  And he said, "Well, I'm gay and your Christian."  I said, "It's still five miles and it's still dark." I'm not crazy.  (laughter from audience)  And he said, "I thought Christians hated gays."  I said, "That's funny, I thought Christians were supposed to love. I thought that was our first command." (audience applauds loudly again)  He said, "Well, I thought God hated gays."  I said, "That's really funny, because I thought God was love."  And He said, "Well uh, do you think uh, God sent AIDS down to punish gay people?"  And I said, "Well, in the same sense that he sends bankruptcy on farmers and presidents on voters."  (audience laughs at presidential remark and Rich pauses before saying...)  "...that there are consequences for our choices and sometimes we have to bear the consequence of other people's choices."  And then he asked me the big one. He said, "Do you think I will go to hell for being a gay?"  Well, I'm a good Hoosier... (audience laughs) ...and I puckered up to say, "Yes, of course you'll go to hell for being gay." Now folks, I will tell you the truth. I got ready to say, "Yes, of course you'll go to hell for being gay," and when I opened up my mouth it came out, "No,... of course you won't go to hell for being gay." And I thought, "Oh my god, I've only been in New Hampshire for one week and I've already turned into a liberal." ...(audience roars out loud in laughter)... What am I going to tell this guy now?  You know there are times when we think we are God's messengers, when we think we are the mouthpiece of God. And God really needs fewer mouths than he needs ears... (audience cheers approvingly)... And there are times when we think we've got it all together. And we meet somebody. And they ask us the right questions. And we get to find out something about God that we learned when we were little because our moms and dads read it to us, and because they took us to Sunday school and we were told over and over the great truths of the scriptures. But we forget them because we get all caught up in how cool we are.  (Getting back to his story, Rich concludes...)  I said, "No, you won't go to hell for being gay any more than I would go to hell for being a liar. That nobody goes to hell because of what they do. We go to hell because we reject the grace that God so longs to give to us... (audience applauds)... regardless of what we do."

      Hebrews 11:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Break Down - "Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see." - NIV  I usually don't care for the NIV&nbsp;Bible but I thought I would break it down with a NIV verse, because this certain verse is actually pretty close to the KJV 1611 edition.  I like this verse, it tells very quickly and very deeply what faith is. Faith is always misunderstood. You see faith is not about saying "I know God will", no! Faith is being absolutly sure of that which you have hoped for, and even though you may not see it yet, that it will come.  LoL I hope you get the point lol, just a short post for Monday  May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd

      Well I usually don't write much but I love reading and today I notice that Sunday's paper is always much broader and larger and so I thought hey I think I should do that on Sunday's Post, so that's just what I will do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :)   So instead of 1 story I am going to give you 2.   My&nbsp;Sleeping Leg and Sleeping Spirit  Well when I started this post my leg started&nbsp;falling asleep lol. I like to assume the indian position while typing and it can sometimes cut off circulation to my left leg. I know your thinking what on earth does that have to do with God? LoL. Well Actually allot more than you may realize, see just like my foot, when our need for God becomes inactive our spirt becomes sleepy and when it falls asleep it&nbsp;becomes hard to wake up and can hurt in the healing process. So if you feel that you are falling asleep with God then I suggest assuming a new posture.   Getting the Picture...  Today My mother took a paint job, for a little while the picture looked great, but then she started painting the kid in the swing and from far off he looked disfigured, but from close up he looked great. I think we&nbsp;to often look&nbsp;up close at the picture in our lifes and don't want to change it but God is telling us to step back and see the&nbsp;disfigurement and correct it. All the Time i have friends who wonder what&nbsp;God&nbsp;has instore for them and they&nbsp;fail to see that God has a picture perfect life instore&nbsp;for them, but first they have to change.&nbsp;   May God Bless you and Keep You,  Bradley Floyd

      Among ancient Greeks the runner who won the race was not the man who crossed&nbsp;the line in the shortest time, but the man who crossed it in the least time with his torch still burning. We are so often so busy with life's activities that we are in danger of allowing the torch of our spiritual life to become extinguished. A good woman once said that in the rush and hurry of her life she felt in danger of being "jostled out of her spirituality." There is a real danger of being too busy to be good, of running too fast to keep our torch burning.   This week I have been real busy, busy with family and busy with band stuff and busy with the website you know and I know that they are spiritual thing's i am doing but yet my focus is not on keeping the fire lit but getting finished on time, it can really be a struggle.   So as we live our busy lives let us remember to slow down a little bit and put a little time in for god. I just finally got a second to write this blog lol. Now it's time to have some God Time.   May God Bless You and Keep You,  Bradley Floyd

      You are familiar, no doubt, with one of the most famous paintings ever done by any&nbsp;artist: The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci, that classic portrayal of Christ and the twelve apostles at the table.  Many students of art history believe that the painting, when first created, was somewhat different from the version which we now see. There was initially, it is believed,&nbsp;an exquisite lace border on the tablecloth. When, immediately upon completion, daVinci invited a group of art students to view his masterpiece, they were immensely&nbsp;impressed by the delicate design of that lacework. They studied it intensely and praised&nbsp;it highly.  Upon seeing the reaction of these young men, the artist took up a brush, dipped it,&nbsp; and made a few long strokes across the canvas, obliterating the lace. Then, with uncontrollable feeling, he shouted, "Now, you fools, look at the face of Christ!" Many times we look for Christ only for the good things he possess, just like the exquisite lace border on the tablecloth, we get traped in the good things around Christ that we forget to&nbsp;notice Christ.

      546 times is the word love found in the bible. That's 546 more reasons to use it :).   Mark 12:30 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'[ urlLink 1 ] 31The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[ urlLink 2 ] There is no commandment greater than these."   Pretty much that means to love God and to Love people. So go out and use that word!!!!  May God Bless You and Keep You. Bradley Floyd

      Well as of late King David has really been in my thoughts, I just got done reading  PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE  and a lot of times it talks about being more like Noah and Moses, and don’t get me wrong they’re great guys and we should definitely be more like them, but also we should be like King David, he had an ambition that all the other ambitions covered up. We can call it his Secret Ambition ;). He had an ambition to have god’s heart, a pure, loving, merciful heart, and although he failed many times to satisfy God’s quench for him to be clean and his own quench to be clean, he never gave up. The funny thing with David is, is he could do a very sinful thing one day, and then dance with zero dignity for God the next day. And that’s just what I want to do I want to be undignified for God. I want to be able to break the shackles off of me so I can dance. God’s purpose is not to watch you do bad and then whip you for it. NO!!! God’s purpose for you is for you to learn that he sent his son to die for&nbsp;you and to truly know what that means, also to not be embarrassed to talk about and to stand up for your God. Let us be like King David, let us break our shackles off and dance before the lord.   Irish Psalm -  Dance as if no one is watching  Sing as if no one is listening  Live like you’ll die tomorrow, and die knowing you’ll live forever!!!   I love that Psalm, but I can love it till I turn blue in the face, but until I live it, it’s just a phrase.   May God bless you and keep you,  Bradley Floyd  P.S.  Be God’s Undignified servant!!!

      Your love is perfect When I love you I have no Fear Your love is perfect When I love you I know you are near  Your love is perfect Perfect for me Y our love is perfect It's all love can be  Your love is perfect In all of your ways  Your love is perfect I will worship you all of my days  Because your love is perfect Because your love has no fear Because your love is perfect I know that you are near  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This poem was written on account of this scripture -&nbsp;1 John 4:18 "There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love." I have been in love with things of the world, they have left me lonely, but I am in love with God and he has keep giving me joy!

      "I 'm Just A Nobody Telling Everybody About Somebody Who Can Save ANYBODY!!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE LORD'S BASEBALL GAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freddy and the Lord stood by to observe a baseball game.&nbsp; The Lord's team was playing Satan's team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord's team was at bat, the score was tied zero to zero, and it was the bottom of the 9th inning with two outs.&nbsp; They continued to watch as a batter stepped up to the plate named 'Love.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love swung at the first pitch and hit a single, because "Love never fails."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next batter was named Faith, who also got a single because Faith works with Love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next batter up was named Godly Wisdom. Satan wound up and threw the first pitch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Godly Wisdom looked it over and let it pass: Ball one.&nbsp; Three more pitches and Godly Wisdom walked because he never swings at what Satan throws.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bases were now loaded.&nbsp; The Lord then turned to Freddy and told him He was nowgoing to bring in His starplayer.&nbsp; Up to the plate stepped Grace.&nbsp; Freddy said, "He sure doesn't look like much!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satan's whole team relaxed when they saw Grace.Thinking he had won the game, Satan wound up and fired his first pitch.&nbsp; To the shock of everyone, Grace hit the ball harder than anyone had ever seen!&nbsp; But Satan was not worried; his center fielder let very few get by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went up for the ball, but it went right through his glove, hit him on the head and sent him crashing on the ground;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the roaring crowds went wild as the ball&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; continued over the fence . . . for a home run! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord's team wn!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord then asked Freddy if he knew why Love, Faith and Godly Wisdom could get on base but couldn't win the game.&nbsp; Freddy&nbsp; answered that he didn't know why.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord explained, "If your love, faith and wisdom had won the game, you would think&nbsp; you had done it by yourself.&nbsp; Love, Faith and Wisdom will get you on base but only My Grace can get you Home:'For by Grace are you saved, it is a gift of God; not of works, lest any man should boast." Ephestians 2:8-9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Psalm 84:11,"For the Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from those who walk uprightly."

      Another Lonely Saturday night, ready for sunday to be in sight, anew week soon will start as a lonely saturday breaks my heart.  &nbsp;  That is how I felt, I guess sometimes we feel so lonely, we feel so bored, we just feel like we are ready to fall apart, but the whole entire time there's Jesus, we forget that we can just turn to him. He is so great, I think some of us&nbsp;feel that we cannot lean on the unreconizable, because he is so hard to get, but God is reconizable, he wants us so bad to turn to him when we are lonely, when we are barely holding on. I have forgotten many times I could do that and should do that. So tonight, although I am somewhat in a lonely state and just want to sleep the day away, I know that if I turn to the supernatual, to the reconizable,&nbsp;that I will no longer be in this mood. God is with us, God is in us and most of all God wants us.  &nbsp;  So tonight I'll turn to Jesus, tonight I'll turn a little Chris Rice on and fall on Jesus. And although my sky is dark I know that the light in the distance is coming for me. I just got to wait for it to carry me away.  &nbsp;   urlLink Genesis 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  &nbsp;  God doesn't want you to be alone.  &nbsp;  If your sad, Cry to Jesus  If your falling, Fall on Jesus  If your joyfull, dance for Jesus  And Live - Chris Rice  &nbsp;  May God Bless You and Keep You  Bradley Floyd

      Well I think this is really a struggle even with the non-christians lol buy probally more so with the Christians. Since we should know that these things of the world are wrong.  I think the great thing about being a Christian is we have an image to uphold, see we as Christians are the front-image of Christ since the world can't see Christ themselves we must show his love, his grace, his mercy and his life to all though us. And that scares me because all the time I'm so scared of mis-representing God LoL, and at times I wish I could be of the world and just not have to face the reality of Christ with in me and Christ Before me. So with that I hope this next story blesses you and keeps pushing you to be more like Christ and less like the world.   Painted Sticks One Sunday a preacher told how, while sitting in his garden, he had watched a caterpillar climb a painted stick that was for decoration. After reaching the top, the caterpillar reared itself, feeling this way and that for a juicy twig to feed on, or some way to further progress. Finding nothing, it slowly returned to the ground, crawled along till it reached another painted stick, and did the same thing all over again. The preacher said: "There are many painted sticks in the world-those of pleasure, wealth, and fame. All these call man and say, 'Climb me to find the desire of your heart, fulfill the purpose of your existence, taste the fruit of success, and find satisfaction, but they are only painted sticks.'" Solomon tried to find the purpose of his life in the world's "painted sticks." He gave his heart to seek wisdom, but learned that it was "vanity and vexation of spirit" (Ecc_1:15). He then turned to the pleasures of the world for meaning in life. He built great houses, and gardens, and pools. He had servants and maidens; in fact, he had all that a man could desire. Solomon's comment on pleasure as a true source of happiness, however, was, "All was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun" (Ecc_2:11). After trying all that the world could offer, Solomon's final decision was, "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man" (Ecc_12:13).

      Greeting the King Noble men were gathered together in London waiting for the King of Great Britain. They all knew him personally, yet they all honored him as their king. When he entered, they stood solemnly to their feet. "Take your seats, gentlemen," he said, "I count you as my personal friends." And then joking he added, "I am not the Lord, you know!" Immediately one of the noblemen, a Christian, said, "No, sir, if you were our Lord, we would not have stood to our feet; we would have fallen to our knees." - Brad

      Whale Songs According to research conducted by the National Geographic Society, the 40-ton creation of God-the humpback whale-has a fascinating singing ability. Recordings have been made of the humpback whale singing in various pitches in solos, duets, trios, and choruses of dozens of interweaving voices lasting from six to thirty minutes. What an experience it is to hear, over one's own stereo system, songs from the ocean depths-sung by 40-ton whales! The passage of Psa_148:7 comes to mind: "Praise Him down here on earth you creatures of the ocean depths."  Keep us in your prayers and May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd

      Well I decided tonight to put all the parts together.  Verse: Mat 8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.  Jesus was a homeless man, he said it him self in Mat 8:20 when he said that he "the son of man had no where to lay his head." WoW to think that our God, Jesus Christ, the one whom we call savior was homeless, now sure there were places he could sleep but never a place for him to call home. I guess this was because Jesus knew that he was only visiting for a little while, that he would soon be leaving, that he would soon be gone, and that this earth was not his home like wise this world is not our home, we are just traveling through this world as visitors. One day our father will call for us and we will go home. How AWESOME!!! But this verse "Mat 8:20" really humbles me and makes me reconsider what I have done and how I can be just like Jesus knowing that this world is not my home and therefore give all I have 'cuz it ain't goin' to heaven with me anyway's. As the Shriners Moto goes "No Man is Taller than The One Who Stoops so low to help a needy Child."  I hope you enjoy these stories. Please write back if this story has blessed you in a certain way. May God Bless You and Keep You,   The Higher the Bamboo Grows, the Lower It Bends A government official who came into President Lincoln's office was startled to find the chief executive shining his shoes. "Sir," he gasped, "surely you do not polish your own shoes!" "Of course," replied the humble President. "Whose do you polish?" The greatness of a man is evidenced by his humility. In the words of an old Filipino saying, "The higher the bamboo grows, the lower it bends." All of this is illustrated in the life of Jesus. "Jesus did not come to be served but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many" (Mat_20:28). The highest title God ever allows in His church is "servant." Am I willing to serve people as Jesus did? I know, I cannot die for people to save them as Jesus did, but I can "die to self" to enable me to tell people that Jesus died for their sins, and thus serve them in the greatest way possible. When I humble myself, then God will give me the grace to grow into maturity where, I like the tall bamboo, can lower myself to serve those of "low esteem." Notice, "Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited" (Rom_12:16). How tall are you spiritually? Tall and flexible enough to serve people in all kinds of situations?  "Brokenness... God uses broken things. It takes broken soil to produce a crop, broken clouds to produce rain, broken grain to give bread and broken bread to give strength. It is the broken alabaster box that gives forth perfume. It is the broken Peter, weeping bitterly, who returns to greater power than ever."

      Well I hate to end with just this story because there are so many great one's, but I promise to write only 3 parts :) so here is the conclusion, and this one really broke my heart.  May God Bless you and Keep You, Bradley Floyd  When Someone Is Needier Than You In a leper colony clothes arrived for distribution among these outcasts of life. One little leper boy was asked what he needed most. He replied, "My hands are still good so I can mend my clothes when they need it, but there are some lepers who have no fingers, and some whose hands are so crippled or sore that they cannot use them. When their clothes get holes in them, they cannot mend them but must see the holes get bigger and bigger. I am thankful for my good hands, so please give the clothes to those who cannot mend their own. They are more needy than I." How we need such unselfishness. We should never complain when we know that there are others who are needier than we are.

      Which Was Neighbor? A certain woman went down from Washington to Richmond and ran over a spike which punctured her tire and left her stranded by the side of the road. After raising the hood of her car and tying a scarf to her radio antenna, she locked the door handles and sat in the car, praying for the Lord to send help! By chance, there came a limousine that way with a bumper sticker that read, "Smile, God Loves You!" When the occupants saw the stranded woman, they passed by in the far lane-without smiling. And likewise, there came a sports car with a CB radio and a bumper sticker saying, "Honk If You Love Jesus!" The man who was driving passed by in the far lane without honking and without using his CB to tell the Highway Patrol about the woman's dilemma. But a certain working man, as he traveled to his job, came to the spot where the woman was and, when he saw her raised hood, white scarf, and flat tire, he had compassion on her. He stopped his old beat-up pickup-which had no bumper sticker-and crossed the four-lane highway, and offered to change the tire. The woman opened the door and gave him the key to the trunk. The man took out the spare tire, jacked up the car, removed the flat tire, and replaced it with the spare. When he had finished, the woman tried to pay him. He refused the money, saying, "If my wife were stranded on the highway with a flat tire, I'd want some Good Samaritan to stop and help her out." He returned to his bumper-stickerless truck, smiled, honked at her, and went his way. Which of these three was neighbor unto her who had a flat tire?  Christ doesn't want to be on a bumper sticker on a nice fancy car, Christ wants to be in your heart. Matt 5:8 Blessed Are the pure in hear for they shall see God.

      Once a young couple lost their only child, a beautiful three-year-old daughter, as a result of a freak accident. Unable to justify this tragedy with their concept of a loving God, they went to their minister for help. "Why?" they asked. "It was God's will," the preacher told them. The couple just couldn't accept that the passing of their little daughter could somehow serve God's will, and they sought out another preacher friend. He quoted yards of Scripture, trying to give them comfort, but his verses fell on deaf ears. Finally, the young couple turned to a frail elderly woman in their church. Surely, she could give them a reason for the child's death, but the old woman didn't utter a single word. Instead, she tenderly wrapped her arms around the heartbroken couple's shoulders, and together they cried the hurt away. Sometimes when theological answers are not easy to the complex misfortunes of life, perhaps we just need to hush our babblings. Sometimes when answers aren't easy, our best statement is silent caring.  Tonight I want to take a moment to talk about Compassion International. This is a Christian Charity Organization, check them out at  urlLink http://compassion.org , that I really feel strong about and hope that while reading a seeing what they do that you will also develope this trust and strong feeling's toward these amazing people. Compassion International is a non-Profit Organization that not only takes the money that you sow and gives it to the kids but also spends times with these kids and teach them of christ. I hope that God will set it in your heart to do what you think is write.  May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd.

      Well this is last post, and I think I leave on a good note with this one. May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd   It Makes All the Difference On a crowded street of one of our large cities, a young man was snatched from the path of a speeding truck, his life saved by a venerable-looking man. Still breathless from fright, the youth thanked the one who saved his life and then was lost in the crowd. Two weeks later in a crowded courtroom, an anxious young man stood in the prisoner's box to be sentenced for murder. "Young man, have you anything to say before the sentence of death is passed upon you?" "Why! Yes! Yes, Judge," the youth responded, "you know me." A silence moved like a shock wave over the courtroom. "I'm sorry. I cannot place you." "Yes. Surely you remember. Two weeks ago. At Main and Seventh Streets, you saved my life. Surely, Judge, you can do something to save me now." A silence pervaded the courtroom. "Young man, now I do remember you. But that day I was your savior. Today I am your judge." Today the Lord Jesus Christ wants to be your Savior. If you refuse Him and His grace, one day He will be your Judge.

      Well I think god is wanting a part 2 to this story lol.   Christ the Way On a dark and stormy night, a child was lost in the streets of a large city. A policeman found him crying in distress, and gathering enough from his story to locate the home, gave him directions after this manner. "Just go down this street half a mile, turn and cross the big iron bridge, then turn to your right and follow the river down a little way, and you'll see where you are." The poor child, only half comprehending, chilled and bewildered by the storm, turned about blindly, when another voice spoke in a kindly tone, "Just come with me." The little hand was clasped in a stronger one, the corner of a warm coat was thrown over the shoulders of the shivering child, and the way home was made easy. The first man had told the way; the second man became the way. This is exactly what the Lord Jesus Christ has been for us. From eternity He has told us that He is the Way. He has to become our Light also, to lead us to the Way.  May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd.

      Well Yet again I have another post, tonight though I really feel like God is talking to me so I'm going to keep on listening and keep on posting till he say's he done with me LoL   Christ the Savior A native of interior China wanted to become a Christian but couldn't understand how Christianity was superior to Confucianism and Buddhism. One morning he came to the missionary in a happy mood saying, "I dreamed last night, and now I understand. I dreamed I had fallen into a deep pit where I lay helpless and despairing. Confucius came and said, 'Let me give you advice, my friend; if you get out of your trouble, never get in again.' Buddha came and said, 'If you can climb up to where I can reach you, I will help you.' Then Christ came. He climbed down into the pit and carried me out." It takes the Savior of man to do that. Only a Savior would stoop so low as to save a sinful soul like yours and mine.  May God Bless You and Keep You, Bradley Floyd

      "Well sometimes my life just don’t make sense at all when the mountains look so big and my faith just seems so small, so hold me Jesus ‘cause I’m shaking like a leaf, you’ve been king of my glory, won’t you be my prince of peace." – Rich Mullins  This just maybe one of my favorite Rich Songs it always get's me thinking of how God is using me and though I sometimes have the hardest times getting through the simplest things of life like learning to love and be loved, and getting stuff done in what time we have, I know that god is still walking with me and still carries me when i can no longer walk...  The Story of Footprints... As I prayed Jesus allowed me to look back in my life as I looked back I saw their were to sets of footprints in the sand, so I asked Jesus "Who's footprints are these?" Jesus Replied "Those are mine, walking with you" And then I noticed that sometimes there was only one set of footprints and so I asked "Jesus, why is there only one set of footprints? Is this when you left me to go through life alone?" Jesus calmly smiled and said "No, those are my footprints, there is only one set because you were to weak to walk so I carried you"  MAN!! That always get's me in tears to think that Christ loves us that much.  The Story of the heavy Cross... Jesus this Cross is to heavy, could you not give me a lighter one please? Yes my child go into that room and pick a smaller one. As I entered the room I saw all these huge crosses so I said "Jesus, who must carry these? He replied These are the one's I carry, cannot you carry this tiny one upon your back?  Isa 53:3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Isa 53:4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. Isa 53:5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. Isa 53:6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. Isa 53:7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. Isa 53:8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.  This is the God that we so often misunderstand, he has done so much already, if he choose's to do more it is through the kindness of his mercy.

      The Right to PursueSomeone cursed Benjamin Franklin, charging that the Constitution of the United States was a farce. "Where is all the success that it guarantees us?" he sneered. Franklin, smiling, answered, "My friend, the Constitution guarantees only the right to the pursuit of happiness." Psa_34:14 tells us to not only seek peace but pursue it. Psa 34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  As we head towards another one of those elections that are so intense let us remember that as a nation we should seek peace and pursue it. It is not about who is the smartest nor who is the richest, it about who's after the pursuit of righteousness and the integrity of all nations to act on it. We live not in society that is given anything but in a society that is given the right pursuit so let us pursue, and though the battle for that pursuit may be long and vigorous let us remember our fathers words "I am with you always." - Bradley Floyd

      Well as get ready to head for the sack, I thought I'd let all you other lonely people out their know that you are never trully alone.  urlLink    Lonely tree in the midst of others.... Good Verses for this entry....  urlLink Psalm 77:7-13   urlLink Isaiah 53:4   urlLink Isaiah 55:8-9   urlLink Matthew 5:4   urlLink Matthew 6:11   urlLink Luke 22:41-45   urlLink Romans 7:18-19   urlLink Romans 7:24-25   You who live in heaven Hear the prayers of those of us who live on earth Who are afraid of being left by those we love And who get hardened in the hurt Do you remember when You lived down here where we all scrape To find the faith to ask for daily bread Did You forget about us after You had flown away Well I memorized every word You said Still I'm so scared, I'm holding my breath While You're up there just playing hard to get You who live in radiance Hear the prayers of those of us who live in skin We have a love that's not as patient as Yours was Still we do love now and then Did You ever know loneliness Did You ever know need Do You remember just how long a night can get? When You were barely holding on And Your friends fall asleep And don't see the blood that's running in Your sweat Will those who mourn be left uncomforted While You're up there just playing hard to get? And I know You bore our sorrows And I know You feel our pain And I know that it would not hurt any less Even if it could be explained And I know that I am only lashing out At the One who loves me most And after I have figured this, somehow What I really need to know Is if You who live in eternity Hear the prayers of those of us who live in time We can't see what's ahead And we can not get free from what we've left behind I'm reeling from these voices that keep screaming in my ears All these words of shame and doubt, blame and regret I can't see how You're leading me unless You've led me here To where I'm lost enough to let myself be led And so You've been here all along I guess It's just Your ways and You are just plain hard to get Copyright 1998 - Liturgy Legacy Music / Word Music / ASCAP
