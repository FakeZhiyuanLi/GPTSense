      You know, it's a shame after 60 years politicians are still exchanging Hitler insults. I thought I might have heard the end of it after Moveon.org's ad and Bush's (oh, I never meant THAT!) ads that mixed in a little Hitler footage in case anybody forgot...enter that murdering bastard Kim Jong-il. Even the Koreans are jumping on the Hitler bandwagon these days:  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3589766.stm .  Sorry, fellas...Hitler is so...well, so  last century.  Get your marketing people to get something more edgy, you know, to suck the kids in. Hitler just isn't doing it for me anymore.  It happens when you run something into the ground like that. How about we reserve calling someone a fascist murdering bastard for the real fascist murdering bastards, not the drive-thru clerk who tells you extra dipping sauce will cost you extra.

      From the Associated Press:  urlLink http://apnews.myway.com/article/20040823/D84KU3QO0.html   I know the US is supposed to be morally superior to the insurgents we're fighting in Iraq.  If that includes not bombing a building into the Stone Age where a known insurgent is hiding in his cowardice just because we're afraid of insulting somebody's imaginary friend in the sky, then I don't care one whit about being morally superior.  Bottom line, we've lost our tactical advantage.  We've let Al-Sadr slip away in the night and who knows if we'll be able to pin him down again like that in the future.  I don't care if the people over there think it's a magic building or not...right now it's being used as a military fortification filled with enemy combatants, and we need to treat it as such.  Do you think if things were the other way around they would hesitate to blow up a Christian church just because world opinion of them would suffer?  I doubt it.  If the insurgents are so pissed off because of the "foreign occupation" then join the democratic process we've started there already and turn it into whatever kind of religious fundamentalist "democracy" (cough, cough) you want after we leave.  It's going to happen anyways.  You're just slowing up the process of the US getting out.

      From WorldNetDaily:  urlLink http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=40096   The Kerry campaign is threatening to sue television stations that are running the new ad by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and Regnery Books, the publisher for the SBVFT's book,  Unfit for Command .  You have to be friggin kidding me.  If you can't take the heat, Senator, get out of the kitchen. In case you've been asleep for the last 6 months, Bush had to contend with Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  and didn't resort to whining and threatening legal action...give it a rest and maybe just shut up (like Bush did) if you're not going to address the accusations directly. You don't have to, if that's your prerogative.

      From SFGate.com:  urlLink http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/08/20/MNGQ28BM1O1.DTL   Somehow Drunken Master Ted Kennedy got on the secret government "no-fly" list and isn't pleased about it. Cry me a river, Teddy, just don't drive your car off into it.

      we can't have rational political debate in this country any more.  Here's just one example of the rabid speech coming out of some liberals' mouths these days:  urlLink http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0818-11.htm

      From the NY Times:  urlLink http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/27217.htm   Why is everybody so hung up on sexual orientation?  If McGreevy wants to have gay sex in his off-time, then I don't think it's anybody else's concern except his wife's.  He spoke up promptly and that, at least, is to be respected.  It's more than Clinton did, arguing over the definition of "is".  He's also probably doing the right thing keeping quiet what with the extortion charges still pending and all.  Why are the Republicans making such a big deal about when he'll actually step down?  Do they really think that a special election will yield a Republican governor when McGreevy's polls have gone UP since the scandal broke?  More moralistic posturing from the Right, in my opinion.  If he's stepping down just because he's gay, or because he got nailed for an extramarital affair, then shame on him.  If you love the cock, just say so, McGreevy, get on with it, and shut the hell up.  What makes me laugh is that Cipel is saying he's not gay.  Could have fooled me!

      From WorldNetDaily:  urlLink http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=40062   Kerry's campaign is requesting that Regnery publishing withdraw from distribution the Swift Boat Veterans For Truth's new book  Unfit for Command  as it contains falsehoods and blatant smear against Senator Kerry's war record.  Give me a break. If we can all tolerate Farenheit 9/11, then we can tolerate a book by SBVFT that not near as many people will read. F 9/11 was a much more available media to the American public. I don't think  Unfit for Command  is going to make that big a splash.   urlLink

      I've never read a "current events"-style political book, but I think I'm going to read this one.  I caught Ben Fritz on The Daily Show the other night and he made quite an impression.  He basically praised the Bush administration for being so meticulously clever with how they present what's going on and deal with crises.  He was very dispassionate and seemed to focus on the psychological aspects of the PR facet that have worked so well.  It looks more tolerable than the obvious propaganda like in Farenheit 9/11.  I'd call it a tactics study.  By my figuring there's about a nickel's worth of difference between 95% of the politicians that have made it far enough up the food chain to be in national elections.  Don't get me wrong, some are better than others, and there are honest and passionate civil servants at all levels...just the higher up you go, the more you compromise your ideals and engage in the political back-scratching.  I think it'll be an interesting read.  I'll chime in again when I finish it.

      Ok, I might as well start off with my lame-brained conspiracy theory about Japan.  As many of you might not know,  Mobile Suit Gundam  is a televised Japanese anime series that was aired in 1979. The idea of Mobile Suit came from the powered suit of  Starship Troopers , a novel by Robert Anson Heinlein (my all-time favorite author). The original  Mobile Suit Gundam  takes place during the One-Year War in the year Universal Century 0079 (U.C. 0079). During this time period humans live in orbiting space colonies called Sides. The ruler of Side 3 declares war against the earth for the independence of the colonies. The story is about a crew of Earth Federation Space Forces on a space ship called White Base that fight against the Principality of Zeon using human shaped weapons called Mobile Suits. The crew of White Base fight Zeon using an advanced Mobile Suit called Gundam, that is more powerful than any weapon that Zeons have previously produced. In the process, the Gundam's pilot, Amuro Ray, and the other draftees are exposed to the harsh conditions of war, participate in many brutal battles, and experience the tragic trials and consequences of the conflict.  (from wordiq.com)   Given that the people of Japan have been bombarded with the concept of Mobile Suits as future military hardware for the last 35 years, it's no wonder that the Gundam Pilot Academy was started in 2002...   2-22-02---- First Mobile Suit Pilot Training Simulator From Mistubishi - Banpresto - Sotsu Agency From   Newtype Asylum  : February 22, 2002: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (Japan), in asscoication with Banpresto and Sotsu Agency, has produced   Gundam Pilot Academy   (tentative title) - the demonstrative version of the first ever mobile suit pilot training simulator in history, which is currently on exhibit and free testing for customers at "The AOU 2002 Amusement Exposition" (International Exhibition Hall 2 "General Zone") from February 22-23, 2002 at the Makuhari Mess, Chiba City, Chiba, Japan. The training simulator - with simulates the cockpit of RX-78 Gundam during the classic 'Jaburo Invasion' as shown in Gundam 0079 animation series - has a maximum of four players capacity, in which the MS piloting and shooting will be handled by the two front row players, and all four players will experience the training inside the simulator, which is equipped with 100 inches big screen image with picture generating equipment powered by high-speed processor, and the 24-bit digital sound source for high quality stereo surround sound; Each pilot's seat can experience the training fully in front, rear, left, right, plus shakeing up and down with maximum acceleration of 0.5G, all courtesy of a 6-axis electric motion base which are used in actual operation simulator for airplane.     And then only a few months later, Mitsubishi made it back in the Japanese news by The National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) granting Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. a prime government contract; developing the H-IIA Standard Type Launch Vehicle:   urlLink http://www.jaxa.jp/press/archives/nasda/2002/11/h2a_20021120_e.html   Hence my name: Mobile Suit Pilot X  I know this is old news but it's a "theory" I've held for a while now.  Anybody else see a pattern developing here? It's a lot of dots to connect. :)  I'd move to Japan if it weren't for their complete ban on private ownership of firearms. At any rate,  Go spacenoids! ^_^
