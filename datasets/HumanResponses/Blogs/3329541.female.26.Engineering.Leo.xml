      As this is my very first blog post I figured that I'd start out by explaining how my wife and I came to call ourselves Mr & Mrs Potatohead.  Amy has always been big fan of Pixar's Toy Story. So on our first halloween together we went to a party that required us to dress up. I remembered how much she liked the show so I suggested the Potatohead's. We were quite creative and came up with some great costumes. Since then it kind of stuck. In fact on our wedding night we didn't want to be "found" so we used the Alias of Mr & Mrs Potatohead.

      I thought I should get a little bit of info on here as you have only had input from the Mr.    Mr. Potatohead and I have been together for about 5 years now, we knew each other in highschool but never hung around in the same crowds.  I didn't realize what a gem he was until we met each other in Costco a few years after graduation.  We chatted there and exchanged email addresses.   He tried to email me but it did not work so he was going to give up. The next day he saw me in the mall and asked me to confirm my email, so he resent it (turns out my email was full so I cleared it out).  I think that we were meant to be together cause if I hadn't decided to go to the mall that day we might not be here today.     Remember that little  decisions that you make each day can change your life forever. Just look at us.

        Nothing like a  spirited drive through one of BC's great windy roads. Still haven't got the new car going super fast, but it does well enough to have some fun... The A/C is sure nice during this little heat wave.    Friday night was the typical setup the tent and inflate the bed for passing out in later on. Amy was on the ball and remembered pillows so sleeping was very comfortable. So comfy that we were able to sleep in 'till 9am which is pretty good for camping.    Saturday was a good day. We had a quick breakfast and headed out to do a Geocache in Edgewood which is quite close to Whatshan lake. The cache was located on a nice rocky beach with rock statues as far as you could see. Geocaching often involves finding that oddly placed rock, but every rock here had a purpose. Immediately after getting out of the car we could here a flute in the distance. Looking out across the bay we could see a well tanned naked man standing on a rock across the bay. Finding the cache wasn't too bad, and the container was really neat. It looked like a military grade decontamination kit.    Back at the camp site the 'grownups' were getting ready to put on the annual game of Uh-oh for the kids. To some it up, basically the adults spent 45 minutes trying to gross out and soak their kids.    Later in the day the adults played a game called 'Better Wed, than Dead', which is like a newly wed type game. The Mrs. &amp; I came in second place beating out Vern &amp; Karen who desperately wanted to win.     Sunday morning I got a chance to water ski, that was fun.... It has been a while since I've been able to get out on a ski, and I paying for it today with sore back muscles.    That about wraps it up for camping at Whatshan Lake.

      The final two days we quite uneventful. My stomach started bothering me so I just tried to stay mellow. By the evening I was feeling better with the help of ice cream and beer.   This morning (the 4th day) we packed up everything and dropped a microcache off at the KVR bridge that crossed over the river.

      When you fall off a horse you have to get back on again.  I started off looking for the instructions for the burner again. I looked in the bag for them and saw this curious little disc. Ah, that must be why I it was shooting gasoline straight in the air... It needed the deflector disc. Now I can make my morning coffee.  With a couple cups of coffee in me, the Mrs, a few friends and I headed up the mountain to find the  urlLink KettleTop  geocache. The cache involved a 300M climb that started on trails, but then just turned into the group of us scrambling to the side of the mountain. Once at the top the view was breathtaking... or was that the climb?  That geocache marks that our 30th find.

         Happy Canada Day. Setup at the site went fine, and we spent the afternoon with Ryan's family a few sites over. Dinner time came soon enough so we went back to our site and started to make dinner. Amy said that she would require some hot water for dishes so I decided to try out my new Primus multi-fuel burner that my best man had given to us as a wedding present.      Uhm.... I'm thinking he was trying to kill us. See, I'm not really much into reading instructions so I just flew at it. I primed up the bottle with the correct number of pumps and started turning on the fuel. Lighter ready and lit waiting for the first hint of fuel. Nothing. It must need more fuel, so I turn up the dial ever so slightly and bang! A six foot flame torch just inches from my curious face.   So after that I started reading the intructions a little bit and played with it some more and still nothing is working right. Well, maybe I'll try again tomorrow.      Mr. “Flame Kissed” Potatohead

        Our trip up here was a little squishy with four of us in a Ford Ranger, but we managed.  We arrived at about 10:30pm and pretty much unpacked and went to bed.     The next morning was Helga and Jeff's turn for breakfast, they made scrambled eggs and hashbrowns. Yum. After breakfast we went to Albas to see the falls. It was beautiful and there were so many falls all along the river. I took lots of pictures. When we were done hiking we were ready for a swim.  The lake was beautiful and it had a sandy beach, so we spent the rest of thr day there.  That night Nikki prepared lasagna for dinner, it was delicious. We proceeded to get into the games, of course there were drinks involved.  After a few rounds we decided it was time to go to the dance here in town. When we arrived there was terrible Ricki Martin music playing. Nikki was not feeling well so she went outside and started to run around the tables outside, so I followed her. We created quite a show for all the boys at the party. We then left but Nikki did not want to go in the car as she thought it would make her sick. Nikki, Vicki and I all walked back to the cabin. On the way Nikki did get sick anyway.  Nikki's aunt Gloria followed in the van, I climbed in the van part way as I had run back to tell Gloria to just go ahead but she felt better staying to make sure we were ok. Nikki finally climbed in the van and we told her to count to 60 three times so we proceeded to count out loud. I guess at the cabin people were wondering what was going on cause all they heard was a speeding van and counting. Afterall the excitment we were ready for bed.    Sunday was our turn to make breakfast, we made breakfast fajitas, they were delicious. After breakfast we went up to Seymour falls.  It was amazing. We decided that today was beach day, so Vicki and Ryan packed us a lunch and off to the beach we went. It was another perfect day so we worked on our tans.  No one signed up for dinner so we went to the local restaurant for dinner.  We got back to the cabin started a fire a just took it easy.     Monday morning Vicki &amp; Ryan made pancakes and bacon. Delicious! The whole process was quite entertaining. Time to pack up and head home. What a wonderful weekend!
