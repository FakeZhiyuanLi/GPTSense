       O n my second appointment with the phase therapist he felt that a doc should check my knee out although I have an appointment scheduled for Monday. This was prompted by the fact that he was under the impression that the graft was from my hamstring muscle, hence the bruising on the underside, and not from a donor tissue, i.e. allograft. So the doc to be on the safe side, although he felt my bruising was ok not too bad, suggested I have doppler imaging done on my thigh. Well this machine is a pretty cool device. The nurse put the probe on my thigh and then with her hand pressed my near my hamstring muscle. On the speakers we heard a loud gurgling sound, which I presume was my blood going through the veins!! The first time I was wondering what was going on. Actually those interested (seldom few to none I presume) should ask Saurabh he was watching the monitors. Well anyway she did this from my thigh to my calf muscle. In short my blood vessels are fine and there is nothing to worry about.   F urther development on post surgery news. I can finally lift my left leg with my knee brace on. This is pretty good progress considering the fact that 3 days back I was having a really tough time lifting the leg without the brace. This is primarily due to fact that my swelling has vastly decreased and I have more control over my knee.   A fter my appointment with my doc on Monday I shall venture going to school. Need to begin preparing for the lab class I'll be TA'ing this fall. This sem is going to be one kicker of a sem, have a course in Physics and Math and TA'ing not to forget the research work, something that I have conveniently side lined!

      Woow has this been a ride of sorts. The build up to the surgery was a through mix of feelings. However, once I was in the hospital gown and the i.v. was in all nervousness was gone.  For those who get queezy reading medical jargon on Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstructive surgery please skip the next bunch of lines. The rest may read on. Well this is what I have done to warrant reconstruction of my torn ACL. My first injury was while playing basket ball. Jumped for a rebound only to land awkard enough to stretch the ligament. The second injury was probably a month and a half later which was while playing volley ball. This time the knee poped while I was reaching for the ball on my left. This was followed by a third injury around two weeks later again while playing volley ball. Input from the doctors side were prescribed pain killers and no mention on the possibility of torn ligaments. These three injuries was followed by a fourth while playing badminton and by then the knee was weak enough to give way on the lightest application of weight on it. The finally injury and which I guess completely messed it up was while playing cricket around two months back. This has prompted a through check up involving MRI scans (the bills of which have just arrived, *sigh*), violent shaking of the knee by orthopedic doctors, and taking down the history of my injury on 5 occasions. The end result of this check up being reconstruction of my left knee ACL. The two options given were: 1) If I don't plan to play any sports and pretty much limit my self to a desk job or a life of equivalent excitment, then surgery can be skipped, or 2) If ever the urge to do any sport with minimal involvment of the leg or go on treks, hikes, etc., then surgery is a very realistic option. The only catch with option 2 being, expected time for full recovery is between 8 months to a year. As of now, I'm on week 1!!  Had my surgery on 12th August, exactly a week ago. Post surgery, I'm in a knee brace from hip to toe and have crutches. Must say one hep knee brace it is. Malvika, Saurabh, Sanketh, Vipul, Arul have been like helping me around pretty much around the clock. Many thanks to them and plenty more to come :)  Time to get back to Colin McRae Rally and then probably get to sleep.
