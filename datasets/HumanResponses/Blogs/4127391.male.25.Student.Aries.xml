      I am presently in the small town of Forest, Ontario in the local library (which used to be the local railway station) doing some much overdue research.  Many have asked me since I moved to the US about Canada's relationship to the Queen.  So here it is, in a nutshell.  Canada is a member country of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Queen is presently our Head of State.  However, over the past century and a half, Canada has grown in its independence from Britain with several notable events, the most important of which was the birth of the Canadian Federation in 1867.  In 115 years, Canada would get its own flag, national anthem, and eventually, full control of its government...   The fundamental text of the Canadian Constitution was the British North America (BNA) Act, 1867, by which the Canadian federation was established, uniting what were then British colonies. The Act was a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament, and as such could only be changed in London. After Confederation Canada gradually assumed more autonomy over its own affairs until its independent status (and that of the other self-governing dominions) was recognized in the Balfour Report of 1926. Beginning in 1927, discussions were held about patriating Canada's Constitution -- transferring amending authority from the British Parliament to Canada - but governments couldn't agree on constitutional amending procedures. Consequently, when Canada officially ceased to be a British colony with passage of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, authority to amend the Constitution remained with the British Parliament. In 1949 the Canadian Parliament was given a limited amending power in areas that did not concern provincial jurisdiction. Despite many discussions and several formal conferences, agreement on a comprehensive set of amending procedures proved elusive for more than 30 years.  Enter: Pierre Elliot Trudeau.  With Quebec under Renee Levesque resisting at every turn, Trudeau took matters into his own hands and organized the repatriation of the Canadian constitution.  The objections of Quebec have nothing to do with any great desire of theirs to remain subject to the British Parliament, but to the intense hatred of the Quebecois for Trudeau, who they saw as a traitor.   I mention the repatriation of the Constitution because there are still many members of the British Commonwealth who have not done this, and so this distinguishes Canada.  So after 1982, Canada's dependence on Britain and her Majesty has been minimal.  Practically speaking, the British Parliament has no influence in Canada's affairs.  But Canada does rely on the Queen for various ceremonial activities.  Most importantly, the Queen issues a "Speech from the Throne" which opens Parliament each year.  Actually, the Governor General (presently Adrienne Clarkson) writes the speech and reads it in the Senate Chamber.  But it is an act of the Queen and requires her consent.  Secondly, all honours issued in Canada, like the Order of Canada, flow from the fountain who is the Queen.  Aside from those things, she opened the Montreal Olympics and made a few visits here and there.  So there you are.  There  is  a Queen of Canada, much to my surprise.  Sorry for the false information that I have been giving all this time.   But if I were at a dinner party with the Queen and the Prime Minister, I'd toast the PM first.  Heck, if I were at a dinner party with the Queen and the President of the Windsor Lawn Bowling Association, I'd toast the latter and maybe then give a head nod to Liz.

      Well, I'm off to the true North, strong and free for a week. So there won't be any blogging, since my mom's igloo doesn't have the internet yet. But here are some great Canadian jokes to ponder while I'm gone:  * What is the definition of a Canadian?  - A disarmed American with health care.   * How do you get 50 Canadians out of a swimming pool?  - Say: "Could you please get out of the pool?"   * An Englishman, an American, and a Canadian were at a pub, and each ordered a Labatt Blue. At exactly the same time, a fly landed in each of the man's beer. The Englishman pushed his Labatt away in disgust. The American picked the fly out of his beer and continued to drink. The Canadian picked the fly out of his beer too, and then he pinched it and started screaming at the top of his lungs: "SPIT IT OUT! SPIT IT OUT YOU MISERABLE BEAST!"   *You might be a Newfie Jedi if...  - You use your light saber to quarter moose. - You have heard the words, "May the force be witt ya by'!" - You eat bottled ewok. - Even C3-PO has no freeking clue what you are saying. - Your father has said to you: "Come on by' son, come on over 'ere to the dark side there and have a Labatt witt yer old man there." - Chewbacca leads your dog sled team with honour. - Your jedi robe is made of seal skin.   * You know you're a Canuck when...  - You design your Hallowe'en costume to fit over a snowsuit. - You understand: "Could you please pass me a serviette, I just spilled my poutine." - You dismiss all beers under 6% as "for children and the enderly... and for export to the US." - You have more miles on your snowblower than your car. - Your fridge is filled with  bags  of milk. - You spent last May 2-4 lounging on your chesterfield watching the Stanley Cup playoffs. - You have to go back inside because you forgot your toque, eh.   That's it there, eh.

      Any Catholic who has read Plato's Apology has had the fleeting thought that Socrates should be canonized. Of course, the thought must be merely fleeting because he died over 300 years before Christ was born. But it is startling to read, especially in the Apology, Phaedo, and Crito, that Socrates went willingly to his death, looked forward to the afterlife, and forgave the man who fed him the hemlock. Here are some great quotes from his last days on Earth:  “To fear death, gentleman, is no other than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.”  “Gentlemen of the jury, I am grateful and I am your friend, but I will obey the god rather than you, and as long as I draw breath and am able, I shall not cease to practice philosophy.” (Compare this to St. Sir Thomas More's last words)  “I have a convincing witness that I speak the truth: my poverty.”  “It is not difficult to avoid death; it is much more difficult to avoid wickedness, for it runs faster than death.”  “A good man cannot be harmed either in life or in death.”  “Now the hour to part has come. I go to die, you go to live. Which of us goes to the better lot is known to no one, except the god.”  I will continue to post evidences of his saintliness as I read them. (All of the above are from the Apology).  I just learned something very interesting too.  There is a rumour that Mel Gibson's next movie might be "The Death of Socrates" or "The Passion of Socrates."  Unfortunately, it would concentrate more on the flaws of the democratic system than on the holiness of Socrates.  Here's a link to the sketchy source of this info:  www.lewrockwell.com/baltzersen/baltzersen9.html

      Ya, don't hit the button that says "Delete blog." It doesn't delete an individual blog. It deletes the whole thing. That's why a window comes up that says: "Are you sure you want to delete the  whole  blog?" And if you're thinking to yourself, "No dummy, I just want to delete five words of my blog," then think again. Because by  whole blog , it meant: whole blog.  I discovered that google cached my blog, which is nice.  I'm only going to resurrect my blog on why I chose the name "Saint Socrates" for this blog.  I've also added a link to that blog that leads you to a source which claims that Mel Gibson might make a movie called "The Death of Socrates."
