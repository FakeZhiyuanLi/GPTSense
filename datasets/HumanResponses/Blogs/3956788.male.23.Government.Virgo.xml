      Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle and the Limbo of the Lost, a geographical area of about 3,900,000 sq km (1,500,000 sq mi), between Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and Melbourne in Florida (located 55°W to 85°W and 30°N to 40°N), in which there have been numerous unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.   The mystery dates back as far as the mid-19th century, with a total of more than 50 ships and 20 aeroplanes having been lost in the Triangle. One of the more notorious cases was the disappearance of Flight 19. Five United States torpedo bombers left Fort Lauderdale on December 5, 1945, on a routine training flight in good conditions. None of them returned. Even the seaplane that was sent out to find them vanished. Other stories about the region include ships found abandoned with warm food left on the tables and planes that disappear without even making a distress call. The absence of wreckage is often cited as proof of the mysterious power of the Triangle.   Explanations are legion, and include death rays from Atlantis and UFO kidnappings. Less fantastic analyses suggest that fierce currents and deep water could explain the lack of wreckage, and point out that several of the losses attributed to the Bermuda Triangle actually occurred as far as 1,000 km (600 mi) outside it. Furthermore, military and civil craft pass through the region every day without mishap. As deep sea diving techniques improve it is likely that more of the lost vessels will be recovered, but it is equally likely that the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle will linger in the imagination for a long while yet.

      Loch Ness Monster, creature that, according to legend, lives in Loch Ness, in Inverness-shire, Scotland. Several sightings in the water of a large, hump-backed animal with a long neck have been recorded, the oldest one being in the 6th century. Reported sightings dating from the 1930s (around the time a road was built around the loch) marked the point when public interest really caught hold.   Doubts over the existence of the creature continue, however: some alleged sightings were later confirmed as being hoaxes and there has yet to be a scientific verification of the legend, despite a number of searches undertaken, including expeditions in the latter part of the last century that involved experts from a range of fields and the use of high-tech sonar equipment.   One theory used to explain the eyewitness accounts and inconclusive photographic and film evidence is that the creature is an example of a plesiosaur that has survived from prehistoric times. Other ideas put forward include the ripples and splashes being caused by earth tremors, and the presence of animals (including deer and dogs) or inanimate objects, such as logs, in the water.   A tourist industry built on the legend has flourished, and visitors flock to the banks of the loch in the hope of seeing “Nessie”.

      Spontaneous Human Combustion, phenomenon of a human body catching fire as a result of supposedly internally generated heat. In folklore it has traditionally been ascribed to supernatural causes, but there are now generally accepted scientific explanations that remove the element of spontaneousness. In all cases the victim has either died alone in a small-enclosed area with no witnesses, or the evidence is poor and unreliable. Consequently, many explanations have been put forward including divine punishment, excessive alcohol intake, stress, bacteria in the body becoming unnaturally hot, and static electricity. How the human body could generate sufficient heat to burn, without affecting the local environment, remained a mystery until the 1960s when the “candle” or “wick” effect was proposed. The theory states that the body can be slowly consumed by a flame of relatively low temperature (about 500° C/932° F) using clothing as a wick and body fat as fuel. When there is poor ventilation, oxygen is soon used up by naked flames (caused by an external source, such as a dropped cigarette), which then reduce to a slow smoulder. The melting body fat is drawn on to the clothing, which acts as a wick, and then continues to burn over a period of hours. Fire damage is limited to the area occupied by the fuel source, that is, the body, as insufficient oxygen is present to allow burning when the fuel is spent. As fire burns upward, lower extremities of the body below the point where the fire has been introduced can remain unaffected.

      Mary Celeste or Marie Celeste, an American brigantine found in the Atlantic Ocean on December 5, 1872, abandoned but under full sail.   The Mary Celeste was built in Nova Scotia in 1861. It left New York for Genoa with a cargo of industrial alcohol on November 5, 1872. A month later the crew of the Dei Gratia, halfway between the Portuguese coast and the Azores, discovered it. Of the captain, Benjamin Briggs, his wife and child, and the other crewmembers there was no trace; the ship’s only lifeboat, sextant, chronometer, and logbook had also disappeared, but its cargo remained intact. The naval court at Gibraltar investigated the case but could not come to a satisfactory conclusion about the fate of the crew.   Since that time many explanations have been proposed, ranging from the predictable (the crew abandoned ship fearing it was about to sink) to the fanciful (the ship was attacked by pirates or a giant squid, or the crew fled believing cargo was about to explode). Nonetheless, the disappearance of the crew of the Mary Celeste remains one of the most famous unsolved mysteries of the sea. The story is immortalized by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in “F. Habakkuk Jepson’s Statement”, a short story in his collection The Captain of the Polestar and Other Stories (1884).   The ship continued to be used to transport goods until in 1884 her last captain loaded her with cheap cargo and deliberately ran her aground on the Rochelais coral reef off the coast of Haiti. The attempt to defraud the insurers by claiming that the cargo had been valuable failed when the ship failed to sink quickly, and her captain was imprisoned. The last resting place of the Mary Celeste was discovered by an expedition led by the author Clive Cussler in 2001.
