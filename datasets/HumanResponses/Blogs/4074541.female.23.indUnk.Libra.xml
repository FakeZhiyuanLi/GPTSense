       Okay so it's a job perk. I get to watch my soap. As long as Princess - my kindergarten girl - isn't around, I get to see how the residents of Salem are doing.&nbsp; Mr. Moose - the baby - doesn't care. He likes the theme music.     &nbsp;   I'll admit I was getting annoyed at&nbsp;Days lately. This happens to me every summer. They start focusing on the teen plots in order to market to kids who are out of school. It makes perfect sense but the teenage/college&nbsp;characters are really aggravating. And I was especially bothered by the recent replacement of the actress who played Belle. Now Belle was never my favorite character, but the old actress was at least easier to watch. She was...&nbsp; meatier (in personality - I don't mean body type). The new one is sort of waify and whiny-breathy. I kept waiting for a big draft to come along and blow her away to the tropical island.    (Was the sudden long hair supposed to confuse us into not realizing that it was a different Belle?)    Soooo - after being especially repulsed yesterday ("Sean would never do that! He doesn't even like girls!") I was pleased to discover that they've replaced the actress again. So I'll be looking out to see what I think of this one.     &nbsp;   I've been watching Days of our Lives for ten years... most of the days of my life. And my mother watched it when I was a kid, so it's in the family. I don't watch any other soaps - except for the opening of Passions because Mr. Moose and I both really like the themesong (he is a musical moose). I like Days  because &nbsp;it is unusual and incorporates bizarre spiritual elements and it's not based at all in reality. However... this island thing is getting to be a little much. How is this possibly going to work out without completely ignoring many things that already happened?  Color me skeptical. And it's time for Sean to get out of the cage. Really.   I do have to admit that one thing I'm really loving is the return to masculinity oozing manly-men. That pleases me immensely. The sensitive wimp of the 80's and 90's seems to fading, at least on Days. I like the forceful bit myself. Speaking of - the Transformation of Lucus is really doing it for me (although Sami's bipolarism is starting to give me a headache "Get out! But I love you! But never come back! But let's get married!").

       My job generates interest. Unless you grew up in an affluent suburb of a major city, you might not know about nannies as professionals.&nbsp; I get a lot of questions and confusion. Don't you have to be British or something? (no) How much can it possibly pay? (you'd be surprised) Don't you want to do something more challenging and fulfilling? (you are an idiot)    Being a nanny has its ups and downs - up:&nbsp;you get to spend the day at the zoo instead of stuck in an office. Down: you have to work for crazy rich people. It is my opinion that the vast majority of rich people (and by rich I mean that they can afford to pay an educated, intelligent adult to come into their home 50-60 hours a week and raise their children for them) are completely insane. The people I work for are great, and this is a good job (if it wasn't, I would quit in a heartbeat).&nbsp; They love their kids, they aren't cheap, and they usually treat me like a human being.   But consider this:&nbsp; They paid half a million dollars for a regular old 3-bedroom house because it is in the most desirable neighborhood in the area. They pay $10,000 a year to send their daughter to a prestigious kindergarten (she had to have an IQ test and an interview to get in). They pay an interior decorator $200/hour to tell them what color to paint their walls. And they pay me more than the average income for a family of four in the United States. So I guess they are financially insane... Actually they are just stuck-up. They want the best - and what costs the most must be the best. And they are completely and utterly clueless about how the rest of us get by.   A recent conversation:  Me: That would be nice, but I don't know how I'd pay for it.  Her: Don't you have a CD you can cash?   I'll tell you more later. Right now the baby's crying. I'm going to hold him and hug him and kiss his little nose... like J Lo says, my love don't cost a thing. Not to him anyway.   &nbsp;

       I hate someone famous.  It's not fair. I don't even know him. I'm sure he's a really nice person. But I hate him.  CB - my employer - has recently become best friends with Famous Person's wife. And my life has changed. Mrs. Famous Person has a complete domestic staff, no job, and as far as I can tell absolutely no responsibilities of any kind (okay, she has to find the perfect dress for movie premieres and other Famous People Gatherings). Anyway CB envies and emulates Mrs. Famous Person to the extreme. CB wishes to be a Woman Of Leisure... but unfortunately (for her), without her income this family cannot afford the kind of lifestyle that allows her to be good enough to be best friends with Mrs. Famous Person. So it's become kind of a Spoiled People's Catch 22. And who suffers most? The nanny, of course.  Since meeting Mrs. Famous Person, CB has become stingy with her days off. She wants to save all her vacation days for those time with Mrs. Famous Person calls to make plans. So when nanny wants a day off, the answer is always "I just don't have that many vacation days left this year" which is a perfectly good answer until nanny sees that CB is taking days off to go designer boutique hopping with Mrs. Famous Person.  I used to have several half-days every summer because CB only works half-days on Fridays. But now Friday afternoons are filled with shopping trips, coffee meetings, and playdates at the House of the Famous Family. (I have to stay here and take care of Mr. Moose because God knows no one wants to be dragging a baby around when they are trying to have a playdate with the fabulous).  The fact is that I have nothing to complain about. I am bought and paid for every weekday all day. If she wants to sit here and stare at me or go running through the mall naked, it doesn't matter. She can still require me to be here. But she could choose to give me a break. She could choose to think of me just every once in awhile. And that's what really sucks about it. I just can't handle people like her... or at least I don't handle them well. When it suits her she can be so nice and caring, acting like we're friends, telling the kids that I'm part of the family. But when it comes down to sacrifice, she makes it very clear that I am her employee and I exist to be there for the times she doesn't want to be.  And that isn't the complete truth. The truth is worse, in fact. Actually deep in the heart of this nanny, I know what is really going on. CB is terrified of her kids. And dates with Mrs. Famous Person are a great way to not have to spend time being a parent. She can handle Princess, but being alone with both of them scares her out of her mind. And so when I'm not breeding animosity like yeast, I feel sorry for her. I can imagine that it must be pretty awful to feel totally incompetent with your own children.  So call me Friday afternoon. I'll be here. Just don't ask me to see his movie.
