      Come notice me And take my hand So why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...  ~ Britany Spears, Everytime~

      Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans? Tight on the top with a belly button ring A little tatoo somewhere in between She only shows to me  Hey we're going out dancin' she's ready tonight So damn good-lookin' boys it ain't even right And when bar tender says for the lady what's it gonna be? I tell him man...  Chorus: She ain't into wine and roses Beer just makes her turn up her nose And, she can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne No Cuervo Gold Margaritas Just ain't enough good burn in taquilla She needs somethin' with a little more edge and a little more pain  She's my little whiskey Girl My Ragged-on-the-edges girl Ah, but I like 'em rough  Baby got a '69 mustang four on the floor, and you ought to hear the pipes ring I jump behind the wheel and it's away we go Hey, I drive too fast, but she don't care  Blue bandana tied all up in her hair Just sittin' there singin' every song on the radieo  Chorus x2  Whoa she's my little whiskey girl my raggid-on-the-edges girl Ah, but I like 'em rough Yeah, I like 'em rough I like 'em rough
