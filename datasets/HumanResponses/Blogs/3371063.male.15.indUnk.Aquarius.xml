      as you may have noticed, i use the words tis, twas etc. alot. i only wish there were more of this it + is contraction-like things. who will join me in a revolution to create more??  t'will, t'had, t'am, t'are, etc. will be added to the english dictionary and the world would will be a better place...  *note - this may require the hypnosis of several/all english teachers in the U.S. so come prepared. All revolutionaries meet at my house friday night for an important meeting and plans.   slowride...

      as i explained in absolutely no detail last post, band sucks. Here is where i go into extreme detail : band sucks,  alot . thats all you must know.   3 hour band practice... at priory... walking about 3 miles... with a basedrum... one 5 minute break...  enough complaining - listen to our new limelight show, its THE best last show. its like a season finale for a tv show.. except it doesnt suck. Limelight will be back next season!!(year)to take over the world! i mean.. u didnt hear that  ok back to complaining - AHHH band sucks!   ok enough complaining - bharats leaving fenwick... thats depressing, kinda.

      Hey listen to the radio show of the century. tis at www.fenwickfriars.com, click internet radio, click "limelight", and listen to all shows there. It might take a total of about 3 hours, but its for a good cause. Think of it this way: its better than making out with a dead man(?).  yes, so as i said my name is alex. theres some other characters on the show, but im probably the coolest.   um . . next monday is our next show. if u want to earn my respect, listen to it live. We might have a guest whos gonna play some geet for us but we shall see.  next are my personal reflections on band: it sucks  and umm,  don't join  although there are some really cool people in band. basically everyone is awesome, excluding a certain few, but thats beside the point.  yeah! no sarcasm later
