             you are violet  #EE82EE         Your dominant hues are red and blue. You're confident and like showing people new ideas. You play well with others and can be very influential if you want to be.  Your saturation level is lower than average - You don't stress out over things and don't understand people who do. Finishing projects may sometimes be a challenge, but you schedule time as you see fit and the important things all happen in the end, even if not everyone sees your grand master plan.  Your outlook on life is bright. You see good things in situations where others may not be able to, and it frustrates you to see them get down on everything.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

      Billy Joel - Vienna  Slow down  You crazy child Your so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you’re so smart, then tell me why are you still so afraid Where’s the fire? What’s the hurry about? You better cool it off, before you burn it out You got so much to do, but only so many hours in a day But you know that when the truth is told, That you can get what you want or you can just get old Your gonna kick off before you even get half way through When will you realize, Vennia waits for you  Slow down  Your doin fine You can’t be everything you wanna be before your time Although it’s so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight To bad that is the life you lead You’re so ahead of your self that you forget what you need Though you can see when your wrong, you can’t always see when your right You got your passion, you got your pride But don’t you know that only fools are satisfied Dream on! But don’t imagine they’ll all come true When will you realize, Vennia waits for you  Slow down  You crazy child And take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile It’s alright. You can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize, Vennia waits for you. That u can get what you want or you can just get old Your gonna kick off before you even get half way through When will you realize, Vennia waits for you Why don’t you realize, Vennia waits for you When will you realize, Vennia waits for you

      Chapter One: Of Snowballs, short skirts, and noble mitzvahs  Christmas break was over and everyone arrived back at Dracnoria with the holiday spirit still not wholly shaken from their souls. Maple Felithelle was dropped off after a three hour drive car ride where she had been forced to listened her Dad's music and although a few of the songs weren't that horrific (not that she would ever admit that) Maple greeted the sanctuary of school with much more enthusiasm then normal. After the customary good-byes Maple's sorrel eyes scanned the jam-packed entry hall for her two best friends. Almost instantly she spotted Ophelia Uta partly because ophelia was a good bit taller then most of the gir|s and a fair few of the guys and partly because she was the only one in the school with long, shiny, caliginous purple hair.  Slinking though the crowd Maple hopped infornts of Ophelia and yelped,"Vous avez effrayÃ hors de moi!" "Have fun with Madam Stepmother?" Maple knowingly inquired with a hidden grin. "Picked up some French but that's about it," and disgusted look overcame her usuallytranquill face as she said this, "After two weeks of her cooking the rubbish they feed us here sounds scrumptious." Maple shot her an understanding look but knew to change thesubjectt, " So, anything worth hearing happen in however long you've been here."  Okay-I have to go meet someone so I'll type the next 9 pages later.

      5 countries since 1990 are known to have executed prisoners who were under 18 years old at the time of the crime - Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, USA and Yemen. The majority of known executions of juvenile offenders was in the USA (6 since 1990).   Great list to be on, eh?  But really, I have mixed feelings about the death penalty,especially when it concerns kids (yeah, I see the richness in me saying that considering I'm 13).  As an atheist I can look at it two ways:                 -Death is the sweet relief that those who deserve the death sentence don't deserve                 -Death is the way to destroy him, the whole eye for an eye thing that is more of a justice thing then a 'make the bastard suffer' thing   The first one is what I stand by (yeah, aren't I a vicious little sprite) because I think anyone who kills so many times or so heinously doesn't deserve to die, they don't deserve the peace of being nothing any more-they should suffer living in prison and knowing that they will remain there forever, knowing that they are hated and that if they were to be freed society will never forgive them for what they've done.  I suppose the reasoning those with religion use is that when they are dead, God will judge them and punish them according. So death isn't just taking someone's life but sending them to whatever version of hell they believe exists.  Of course I stopped believing (if I ever really did) in that silliness years ago so the question I must ask is, Is it better to not exist, or to exist for years, decades in jail before not existing? Is living worse then not existing?  Once I clear that up with myself I'll tell you which side of the capital punishment fence I'm on.  Til then-I'll meet you on the fence post.
