      I sit here, just looking at him. Cars, buildings, busy people passing by.  He seems preoccupied. I wonder, is he thinking about us? I smile as I stare at the one thing that changed my life. My thoughts drift to the day I told him what I felt. Tears.. I remembered. And a lot of love. I smile again...First gear... Second... third... Eyes on the road. Not even a trace of happiness on his face. I wonder. Religion? Money? Sex? Is love ever enough? Whatever happened to us?  Sigh.  What's  your problem?  Smile. I'm alright. First time I fall this deep. First time I'm messing up. First time I love anyone more than myself. First time I hurt someone so bad. Like a duckling in a vast lake. I feel lost. This love... so unfathomable. This love... so new. Consumes me like fire.  Twenty-three years I waited. I'm not about to give it up. The ups and downs. The laughter and the tears. There's an inner sense of happiness. Ride on... 100.. 120 on a winding road. Makes my stomach sick. or not? Hold on. Seat belts tight. Makes me want to scream sometimes. Good? Bad? Definitely nice. Hang on... crazy feeling I can't have enough of. Like a bad medicine you get addicted to.  I turn to him. I'M SORRY. Hugs. Kisses. Don't ever do it again.  And I love you so.  Yes, he loves me. Every day... feels good just knowing that.

      And Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings. This house is uneasy. Unlike my recliner in the office. Sleep through the day... easy. Step out of the fridge... and I find you. My comfort. My shield. My life. Oh you're on the phone. I'm sorry. Warm iced-tea in a white-tiled dining/locker room. Toothpaste-on-a-toothbrush in my mouth afterwards. Breath meant for kissing. Good morning!  What's for lunch? Let's eat Chinese. Nooodle time. Yawn. Yawn. Yawn. I love you. And you love me too. Perfect day. A movie. In my house... quick shower. Put on fresh clothes. Back in our home... with a recliner in the fridge. Regular days... I am living. I am alive.  Now I woke up... and my pillow is wet.  Sundays are for weeping, and early Monday mornings.

      First quadrant. Friends chatting. Sex rings and stuff. Mya got irked. She was hurt. I’m an asshole. Always have been. Old and wasted, and definitely an asshole. That’s what they think. That’s what she thinks. I say to myself… hey it’s ok, every family’s got one nowadays. They all laugh. They all enjoyed the joke. What joke? I was serious in a way. Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m still an asshole.   Too much confidence can kill a man. I believe that everything I do is always right, so it’s always ok. And it only follows that everything I say is just. Why do I think that way? I smile and I say to myself “you’re an asshole!” and it feels good. Do I shun myself from other people to let them know that I’m a tough guy so they won’t mess with me? Probably. Yeah, that surely explains it. A bully. I walk through life knowing that I am king, and I own you. No questions. I own you.  Pause. A long one. Thinking. It felt bad didn’t it? Why do I feel bad? Mya got irked. She was hurt. And I’m an asshole.   Mya still loves me.

       creaks in the wind   time passes whether you want it to or not.  i decided to take a back seat and let the scenery run by.  like watching things happen to somebody else who just happens to look like me.  no pain no happiness no fear no pride. took a vacation from myself headed nowhere. nowhere.  ended up in regret somehow.  tried to get back in the game but got swept in and couldn't find my feet.  i took a long time of stumbling around; taking too many looks behind; falling to my knees.  getting back on the horse isn't the tough part, i believe its staying in the flow so you don't fall off.

      I stare at my half-empty glass of golden bliss that sends chills down my throat, while this stupid guy on the boob-tube pretends he’s the president of the USA and declares war over Vietnam. Wanted to call someone, realized I don’t have a phone. Wanted to buy one, realized I’m short by a buck.  Buck-naked man drinking beer. A knock. Someone at the front door. Stairs leading down. Door swung open. Hi bro, wher’ve ya been? Back to the stupid guy/president.  Outside… must go out some more. No, not some more. Must go out. Always in-front of the boob-tube. Climb more trees, play more games… hide and seek. Ride my bike, fly a kite. Hey bro, let’s go swimming. Hey mom, hey dad, take me to a movie?! Grandma, grandpa… are we gonna go on vacation? My computer broke… that’s it for the games.  And then I turned 27 again.

      I bumped into a friend the other day. Haven’t met him for about a year.  Small talk about past trippings. Rock concerts and alcohol shots. Made me feel old. When my mom and dad would lecture me six years ago I would readily tell them to leave me alone ‘coz I’m old enough to know what I’m doing… how I wish now that I am not old enough to know any better. Mya would definitely disagree. I was told that I feel old because I always think I am old… I think I am old because I’m surrounded by young people who think they are already old enough. I don’t really dig old people. They are always serious about life. Why is everybody in a hurry? Life is spinning around me so fast I could scarcely keep up. Does anybody ever really stop to ask what would he or she be ten years from now? Answer: older. Smarter or richer or poorer are just a product of time. The only thing that is definite with time is age. Ten years from now I will be a lot older… will I be happy? Well, I am happy now. If I look back ten years ago I was also asking myself what I would be in ten years… answer: Happy. Content? Well, just happy. I have someone who makes me happy. But still I feel old.  Mya still disagrees.

      The clock breaks the silence... it's six in the evening, got out of bed. Poured hot coffee that would perk me up the rest of the night, audio slave cd in my boom box... nextdoor neighbor yells. Bath time. Hey dude, put on yer jeans, gonna be late for work. Sunglasses at seven o'clock PM. Time to log in. Calls, calls, calls. Sighs. A long one. Why is this sigh extra-ordinarily long?! Oh yeah... I remember. Just remembered. I'm in a rut. And I can't get out, not yet. So calls, calls, calls... and more calls. Lunch break. Lounge. Sleep. Not really!!! Pretend to be asleep??? Most likely!!! Lunch break's over. Oh shit, two more hours. Well, it's an all night thing. Log out guys. Ooops, not so fast... post shift meeting. Kill me now, please!!! At long last, time to go home. No??? oh yeah, more work. Pantry... number seven please (hot choco). Call center life...   And I'm a Mechanical Engineer back in college.

      Never had I seen a girl who is truly an F1 addict. You can see the passion in those eyes... the way she talks about it, the way she gazes steadily at the boob-tube this one time I sat with her to watch the ending part of a not so great of a race. Imagine, the end part, not so great a race, but still it sparked something in those eyes. She has the heart. She has the spirit. If she was one of those seatbelt strapped German race car drivers behind that blazing red tiny contraption with a stallion as an insignia, she'd be a God, not much like myself, but a God indeed in her own right. And since I know a lot about how a car ticks more than your average guy, she bombards me with questions always with a grin on her face trying to digest what I am about to tell her... digesting it already even before I could answer. I play hard to get. Though it pisses me off sometimes because just the thought of tinkering with an engine sickens me (imagine growing old as a kid cleaning carburetors and changing engine oil for your dad, not to mention entering an  engineering school in college), I envy her because I once was like her, but I lost the passion. I lost the heart.  A question: Why?  Do you really want to know?  Normally I would answer I had gotten tired of it.  But I never did.  It is who I am... not just what I do.   But I steer away from it for the moment, because it is hard for me to be who I am where I am right now, because right now, what I do is all I can afford to be. But she drives me. And it makes me want to be somewhere else. Where I can be who I am for her.  And the green light flashes...

      A bitch from hell. Workstation drama queen. Power-tripping pale lesbian. Hormone deficient homo erectus. How do we blame her? Trigger-happy lazy bone. Is she suckin' too much caffeine? Nicotine dependent hairless ape. Manual driven automobile incapable. what a wus! Always sees me for the wrong reason. Pretensious friend... wolf in a sheep's clothing. Why do you think you rock? My ass!!! If stupidity can be bought, you'd be priceless. Name as sweet as a peach... you foul my tongue in disgust. Why do you push me so? Don't touch my love. Nobody can.  Why do you test my patience? Don't make my love cry. Nobody can get away with that. Don't tell my love where to sit. Don't tell her where to go. Not even you can do that.  Who the fuck do you think you are??? I am a grasshopper, yes. But you are no dalai lama. Get off my back.  And now a cite form.  Of course you know...  This means war.

      Stop... look... and listen! Are those people's eyes that stare at me/us? Must be somethin' on my face... on my nose? Or perhaps there's somethin' 'bout you. About you... yes. About me. About me. What about me then? Is there somethin' I did... Somethin' I failed to do? People lookin'... starin'. Talkin' to each other, behind our backs. Behind our backs! Friends they are. Talkin' about somethin' on your face... on your nose. Or perhaps there's somethin' about me. About me. Yes. About me. Not gonna ask what about me... I know. Thanks for the sugar on my lips.  And then Shakespeare:   "There are more things on heaven and earth, Horacio, than your so called philosophy."  Stop... look... and listen!

      It’s cold outside and you sit in your garage… double shot of Jack Daniels coming right up. Straight-no-chaser, just how you like it. Puffing on your Marlboro 100’s… red. You have a grin on your face. I love the smell of clams on your grill… while dried leaves fall all around the place. What are you staring at? You stare into space like you’re looking at the woman of your dreams. Why do you have tears in those beautiful brown eyes? Your brother sits with you, talking carelessly… about how things will be alright. About how we all face hard times in our lives. Why won’t you let go of that bottle? Why do you smoke so heavily? Why do you kill yourself? You just sit there numb… dead from the inside-out.  Like an empty shell impervious to cold.  I shake my head… you poor soul. You are so lost. Why are you alone in this?  Long night. Tough week. You lose yourself over that red bell pepper with cheese wrapped in egg  and cold milk straight out of the fridge. Your mom is talking to you… you have no idea what about, your head is pounding. Your mouth so dry. Hang-over. Straight into your mouth goes an Advil out form the closet. In and out of your ears is your mom’s early morning lecture. Do you wanna talk about it? She asks. A big gulp of milk to wash down that oily egg concoction. It all wants to come out again. It’s a weekend. Weekends mean no work… no greasy fingers and dirty tool boxes and screwdrivers that you turn and turn, ‘til your hands hurt and bleed and makes you not want to see another mechanical tool ever again.  Relief. An escape from the things that occupy you and makes you forget. Forget about your past. And how it betrayed you. Forget about how we all face hard times in our lives. Like what your brother said. It’s a weekend. And you remember well on weekends.   I made you stand up from where you were sitting. I threw your Jack Daniels and Marlboro 100’s in the trash. I caught your attention from staring into empty space. I gave you your life back again. And gave you company. I made you forget everything that is putting your life on hold. I set you in motion. I set you free.  Don’t go back into the dark… it gets so scary sometimes.

      Tell me how much it hurts... and I will say to you I'm sorry. Show me how much I betrayed you... and I will calm you down as if to a lake. Should I turn back now and leave you to the wolves? Or protect you with all my love and soul? The latter seems more appropriate... but that is not to be deliberated. I give you my pain that which is love... and I give you my hell that which is my soul. Ease my suffering by easing the pain. Take me out from hell by cleansing my soul. I will give you my all while you owe me nothing in return. And this is how much I love you.  Kiss me when you see me... and I shall writhe in pain for it will be death to depart from you afterwards...  my love.

      This morning I woke up with the smell of toasted bread and melted butter, with the strong scent of brewed coffee on a hot teapot. Quiet. Airless. Humid. Hot. My body is sweaty all over. My thoughts are throwing off pictures of yesterday’s events. Tears. Pain. Sufferring. Betrayal. The hurt in her eyes were unbearable. Sorry. Not enough. Her tail lights shining brightly while she cried on her way home. I know she did. Leaving. How can I bear the thought of losing her… never! Hot coffee on a teacup is strange, but then again, I am hungry. One sip, one bite. And I see her face in my mind. Will we ever have breakfast together again? When the door swung open I knew it’s time to go. It’s 7 o’clock in the evening, and my morning bird now sings, and it’s time to go to work once more. I will be waiting…  &nbsp;  you are my first thought in the mornings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Frightened, feeling approaches, terrified we run away. when it comes near we panic... and we always panic when we cant understand things.  -------------------------------------------   Uncanny just the mere thought of its presence, "it" being the subject of pitiful misjudge, seemed enough to obliterate that years-long to develop courage. that sole apparatus responsible for our good grip at life.  -----------------------------------------  what if some entity just decided  to tell us the truth, to reveal the reality, tell us that these are just illusions  We are in the state of Maya.   but we run away from it we're scared scared of something different different from what we know unusual from the truth that has so long been identified by the society and so tediously but consistently been honoured by us--  the subjects of this confusingly confusing world.   the truth approaches  and we run away  we cant control our emotions then we get scared scared of the ultimate truth  we only entertain what's familiar, different always sounds like a lie to us.

       IMAGINATION   I was watching my favorite soap opera, Dawson’s Creek, when to my genuine surprise Pacey stunned me with a line he was delivering. He was arguing that the finest form of entertainment or pleasure can only be achieved through anticipation, meaning we’ll achieve the most blissful entertainment through anticipating and assuming the outcome or being of things. He said, when we are experiencing the uncanny state of being in love, we try to have this deep delightful contemplation and reflection followed by an attempt to describe and be fascinated by the faultless form or conception of love that we have in our minds. We assume/imagine scenarios wherein we’ll feel that love is perfect and always exuding happiness, like thinking that you’re dating your subject of hormonal affection in the most magnificent manner. You even perpetually try to have this thought run over your head, because only through this can you more accurately define how happy loving and being loved is.   There are things better kept in our heads for us not to spoil its essence.

      “Heaven and Earth are impartial, they treat all creation like straw dogs”  This phrase serves as an ultimate reality blow to all those "arrogantly conceited" people, whom in some inexplicable manner succumb themselves with the idea that they should be accumulating all the possible materialistic wants that they oblige themeselves to need and bleakly suppose that the heavens and earth both connived to give them biased treatment whenever they were not able to grab what they’ve been ravenously craving for. And also in the case of the catatonic and neurotic-depressive people whom “in the slightest provocation would leap at each other’s throat” (sorry Jessica Zafra) only because they feel so abandoned and not living and as always blames the inequality of life.  Well all the predicaments that we are situated into occurred simply because we have contributed something, even a very minute factor, that resulted to that specific dilemma. These wild concoctions over us being unfairly dealt with by the Heavens is the traditional scapegoat of those losers who claim that they should be the victors.

       BEAUTIFUL   With the ardent obsession that we have towards acquiring and only entertaining what is beautiful, the definition of ugliness constantly widens and becomes more present with as much intensity as that of we want it to vanish.  We merely perceive things as beautiful only after evaluating and comparing it to all the other beings that exist. The more we seek and brand something as beautiful, or visually pleasant, the more we tend to make the other things ugly because one has to suffice the quality of those who were tagged as beautiful. Basing from the “Status Quo”, people applaud the beauty of a certain person or thing always and/or only at a specific span of time. Meaning, they say you’re beautiful now but months after they found a new and more beautiful being than you are, you all of a sudden become ugly.  With the very same principle, the existence of good and evil can as well be related. When we see things as good, it is solely because we have witnessed or experienced evil things.    Evil and Good are innately paired.

      Hatred has always been the product of loving.    first u feel like love could be the sole source of bliss in this generally mad world. but when u have finally received that love that u've been cravin for ur entire life. then u'll realize that it is just one of those addictions that this world has created to keep themselves busy with. and like all other kinds of addiction, this will seriously endanger your health.    u think that tiny bit of love is enough to break-even all those amount of pain and suffering that entails to it?  i need to understand if any risk is worth taking just to belong to that ubiquitos, society-induced, sado-masochistic, most celebrated hypocrisy that has so relentlessly turned the world into a love-cracy.   Enough dosage of this would definitely blind, numb and dumb us. It will make us feel nothing but its inhibitions. And that I think is the only bliss it could offer, it makes us feel nothing. We consistently become apathetic to all the norms. We become one with our inner self.    ------------------------------------   contributed by :  tha motha fuckin' grasshoppah    Christianity in itself is a freakin’ stupid story altogether that I feel so sickened about it because it is obvious that it is just a story based on all the lies that the people of the church would want us to believe. I’m not saying this because I hate the christian religion that I grew up with, it’s just how the whole freakin’ story is trying to mold each person with lies, lies, and lies. Take this one example. Mary, the mother of Christ, could do nothing but shed a tear when her son Jesus was being tortured to death by his agressors. Who in the right mind would believe this? MILLIONS! Why? Because she has been described as an idol that we should worship. But if you scrutinize it deeply, the female mammals would even give their lives to protect their children. She did not even raised her voice in protest of what the romans are doing to her son and even when the jews sentenced her son to death by crucifiction. If I was the mother of Jesus Christ in these times I’d take a fucking blowtorch and burn everybody’s asses in that freaking place.  So what I’m exactly saying is, for every action there is always an exact and opposite reaction.  Why would God send his son to die on the cross for the sins of all mankind? Why not kill a turkey instead? Anyway, He's God... that can be done! You do the math!   ------pang addict ano?    (gawa ni glen "scammer" disu)

      ant under my shoe   So a brother now walks through life as indepentdently as he can and with no one to share his woes and conquests as&nbsp;I tell you now that that is the most simple way of saying "fuck you all" to the world that is full of shit and and mostly full of sick fuckin' bastards who are good for nothing but make life more complicated by simply being the asshole that everybody so much hates and on top of all this you are powerless because he can do whatever he thinks he can do to you no matter what you think, say, or do because you are insignificant and just an ant in his great big world that he is in control of and for that you are in envy of his power and that you want to grab him by the throat and just squeeze and squeeze until the precious life in him goes out and all he can see is the dimness and the flickering light that slowly burns out that is his life and through all this all of which that he had done through out his stupid and meaningless life will flash through his mind's eye and he will writhe and squirm and scream for he knows where exactly he will end up and where else but in the bottomless pit of hell where sufferring is the game of the day and that no amount of prayer would actually save his hide and be that as it may we all know that &nbsp;you would still hate him for all the shit he's put you through and all the fucked-up lies that he told about you and how he made fun of you in front of your other friends and how he stole your girl and ravaged her while you respected her when she was in your hands and how he goes about telling all of this to everybody that you know be they family or friends altogether while they laugh at you and mock you for being weak and stupid and insignificant just like an ant in his great big world that he is in control of. (Gasp)Tell me... brother!Deep down in your soul, between these two guys...Who would you rather be?

      I am the real Bunnyman. Lord Almighty.  Wont you come with me? Sweet bliss.  A stiff neck viagra stuck in my throat.  Earth shatters, leaves falling ecstasy.  I need you. I want you. Do you mind?  I will conquer I will seize.  Wine bottle emptied. Skin turning red.  Sweat. Hot breath. Pulsating.  Eyes dilating. Trembling. Gripping.  I am the real Bunnyman. Lord Almighty.   And now you know me.

      "D'ya thank ye can ever gut a pig boy?" his stepfather asked while he was watching him disembowell the beast that his mom will serve for them for about a month. His bloodied shirt is what interested Billy... he was thinking what it would be like if it was his own blood that was dripping on his shirt and not of that stupid beast that was whining just a couple of minutes ago, with its neck now torn open and its belly exposed to the sharp blade that his stepdad grinds on a stone every now and then. The beast was huge, but so was his bastard stepdad. "Go and geet me a buckeet of wa'er, ya good for nuthin' stoopid lame!" as he kicked the pale towards Billy. He was motionless for a second, but when he saw the behemoth move forward with his eyes crossed he knew it was time to get that water, or else he's be shoved back in the pen with those pigs, not to mention having to eat nothing for days except for left overs that he'd share with those whining beasts. He heard his mom's footfalls, the barn door opened and she swayed in, drunk as usual. He went out with his head bowed down to where the well was, pulled the rope 'til his hand hurt. What little muscle he had as a kid. "Damn this well is deep" he muttered to himself. When he stepped back in the barn with pail in hand, he saw the bastard on top of his mom, with the blood on his shirt. The fuckin' bastard was giving it so hard to his momma that&nbsp;he never even heard him come in, and his mom just laid there looking at him grinning. When he was done he threw a piece of meat at her and ordered her to prepare for lunch.  Billy didn't mind seeing that. His mom was still beautifull at thirty five, and her body was still that of a prom queen. He would dream of her every now and then. That was his secret when he was&nbsp;a boy. His deep, dark secret.  "Ya like wutchin' like that ey Billee? Maybee eet shuddah been you who wus lyin' back eer instead of yer momma ey?" he said while cupping his balls. Billy ran inside the house in pursuit of his mom who was still drunk as hell. She was still naked when he went in, and he could tell by the looks of it that she was not in any way gonna prepare anything for dinner. She went into her room, sat on the bed and took her bottle by the neck and chugged far too many. She fell to the bed unconscious. He went closer to look... her bossom was as white as silk, with its pink nipples pointing upwards. He wanted to touch them but he was afraid that old fart would come in any minute. Billy was hard as a rock now. And he ran back to his room crying. He heard the door slam shut in her mom's bedroom. He heard the fuckin' bastard yelling at his mom who was way knocked out. All of his shouting were nevertheless disregarded. Then he heard the shower turn on.  He stood up and took somethin out from his dresser drower. A picture. His dad. His real dad. He had died in a stupid war. He was a soldier. He never saw him though. He only heard stories of him that his mom would tell him every now and then. Of how his dad was a good for nothing son of a bitch who had left them to fight a stupid war and died on them without even marrying her, and how he should never be like his dad when he grow up, a good for nothing son of a bitch.   He ran outside the house...  picture in hand.  He sat back in the pen with the beasts.

      "Are you gonna have the usual?" the waitress asked as he sat there drinking his whisky laced coffee. He nodded without even looking up at the lady and exhaled the smoke that he had been holding back deep in his lungs for the longest time. The restaurant is almost empty at this time of the night when most of the townsfolk are already in bed, or watching porn with their wives that they treat like whores out of some corner in the alley. Children mostly stay up late but not to go out in the streets but because their stupid parents are having another one of those fucked-up issues again that would send a patrol man into their house because the next-door neighbor stuck her goddamn nose in some other people's business again. This time of the night nothing much happened, except for the occasional drunkards sleeping on the sidewalk throwing up their guts out, and begging to have a light because they could not find a decent job because the society would not accept a man who had gone buck-naked and is good for nothing but to drown themselves on that intoxicating spirit. He was sober though, Billy.   Ten minutes later he was served with the lousiest pancake anyone could ever imagine. And the butter had not even melted on top of that three-layered spoil. It was half burnt, the kind that any amount of syrup would not even sweeten one bit. But this is his "usual", and this is how he liked it served. The bastard. He took one bite out of that shit, took out five dollars in his pocket and some change for the annoying waitress who did nothing but stare at him the whole time Billy was sitting there. Billy knows what she wants... and he's not about to give it to her tonight. Maybe some other night. When she's not so welcoming and fucking her would be more fun. Men really has an appetite for resistance.   Closing the car door after him, he rested his head on the steering wheel... moaned and yelled 'til he hurt his throat, fell silent and slept.   "Wake up, you cursed devil. Wake up and make her bleed. Get in between those fat thighs of hers and make her bleed. You know how she likes it. You know how WE like it. Wake up or you never will."   And he threw his head up back in the seat...

      His clothes are dripping water straight out from the lake where he had just taken her. His clasped hands are trembling as he sits on a rotting tree, his eyes fixed on the spot where he stood with her a while ago… his breath steaming while she cries for help.  “Shut the fuck up!” he said… talkin’ to nobody in particular.  “It’s already done… she’s in the bottom of the goddamn lake! So shut the fuck up!”   He stood up and got back to his car, lit a smoke, and drove as fast as he could… steady.   The demons in his head had stopped talking right now. “It’s already done!”

      So a brother now walks through life as indepentdently as he can and with no one to share his woes and conquests as&nbsp;I tell you now that that is the most simple way of saying "fuck you all" to the world that is full of shit and and mostly full of sick fuckin' bastards who are good for nothing but make life more complicated by simply being the asshole that everybody so much hates and on top of all this you are powerless because he can do whatever he thinks he can do to you no matter what you think, say, or do because you are insignificant and just an ant in his great big world that he is in control of and for that you are in envy of his power and that you want to grab him by the throat and just squeeze and squeeze until the precious life in him goes out and all he can see is the dimness and the flickering light that slowly burns out that is his life and through all this all of which that he had done through out his stupid and meaningless life will flash through his mind's eye and he will writhe and squirm and scream for he knows where exactly he will end up and where else but in the bottomless pit of hell where sufferring is the game of the day and that no amount of prayer would actually save his hide and be that as it may we all know that &nbsp;you would still hate him for all the shit he's put you through and all the fucked-up lies that he told about you and how he made fun of you in front of your other friends and how he stole your girl and ravaged her while you respected her when she was in your hands and how he goes about telling all of this to everybody that you know be they family or friends altogether while they laugh at you and mock you for being weak and stupid and insignificant just like an ant in his great big world that he is in control of. (Gasp)  Tell me... brother!  Deep down in your soul, between these two guys...  Who would you rather be?  &nbsp;

      As i was sucking this big lollipop cookie while writing this uneventful way of screaming on top of your lungs aching to be heard and be noticed for the great many things that you have shared which is writing, and yet i am always compelled to feel that greatness and aura of independence in the cool streets of baguio. All alone, no one to look after you, hell they care you sleep at Burnham Park and wake up still wearing same unwashed office clothes and yet get the smiles and the non-chalant feel of fellow workers who have no idea of what underpaid is and yet still are compassionate and&nbsp;dedicated with there&nbsp;means of living and&nbsp;about their way of life.  Not as liberal as what we hoped it to be, well, it is a choice and lifestyle. maybe its because of weather that it seems so perfect for a little birdie like me. Or maybe it was a wrong assumption of a birdie getting the poopoo days counting up here, ei?  The nightlife has yet to see the fresh feel of my wings brushing in their faces down the crowded and rowdy streets of session, legarda and nevada square. I love it.  It was an epitome of the real orgasmic wings of freedom indeed. better watch out dorm boys birds peeping down ready for the plunge of the hot, entangling shower of hot water on smooth skin with hairs falling down the drain. Well, heres a cold tub for you to sulk in my friend.

      I am the real Bunnyman. Lord Almighty. Wont you come with me? Sweet bliss. A stiff neck viagra stuck in my throat. Earth shatters, leaves falling ecstasy. I need you. I want you. Do you mind? I will conquer I will seize.  Wine bottle emptied. Skin turning red. Sweat. Hot breath. Pulsating. Eyes dilating. Trembling. Gripping. I am the real Bunnyman. Lord Almighty.  And now you know me.
