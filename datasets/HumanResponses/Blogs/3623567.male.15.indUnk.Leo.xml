      All of this working is really wearing me out.  Yesterday i was burned pretty bad so kev had to take me home aroun 4.  I did 7 driveways that day so that just added to it.  Adam and Kev had a late night last night so both of them were out of it today. Adam, Dave and I finished one driveway before Adam called it quits.  Good call because its pouring right now.  I really dont have much to say ne more

      So i went to work with kevin today and we all went out in 3 different trucks.  I rode with my bros friend Adam and his cousin dave.  It was pretty fun.  We were the only crew who got somethin done before noon.  And i finally met Dustin "Stupendous Man" who i have been playin CS with for the longest time. I willa admit that when i first saw him it looked like he was blind.  His eyes are like all one shade of color but hes still seems pretty cool to me.  According to the secrety (Terry) there was a "Sow" developing west of us.  "Sow" must be code word for a storm cell....crazy woman...  So after we got done and all cleaned up and what not Kevin, Adam and myself all went out to LoneStar.  It was a blast.  Kevin and Adam were such pimp, apperantly their in there like 3-4 times a week just to see Holli with an I.  They were layin there mack down and we wer all being perverted like always.  But it was way to much fun. But Holli asked for kevin and adams number, so i think one of those guys are gonna be tappin her by the end of the summer.  Its prolly gonna be me tho.  So after we got done there we went over to adams house to shoot some pool and play some Polish PinPong. Ill explain that later.  It started to rain pretty bad so we hurried up and got home.  As soon as we got back to adams all you hear was this big "BOOM".  A fucking bolt of lightning hit the transformer in adams back yard and started up a big ass fire.  I didnt see it.  Ill admit i was scared as shit and ran into the middle of the room being the big pussie i am thinking imma get hit my lightning.  SO the power lines and transformer are on fire and u can just feel the house shaking.  The floor underneath ur feet was just like "Errrr" it was the freakiest thing.  The lites were flashing like crazy so me and kev helped adams mom unplug a bunch of crap.  It took like 20 minutes for the fire department to get to adams but by that time the fire was long gone.  So adam and i hung back looking out the window while Mr."Hardass" kevin went out side to investigate. All you hear was a little bit of cracking, then "BOOOM" right near kevin outside.  Mrs.Kelley, Adam and myself though Kev was a goner.  So kevin took me home around 3:30 so that him and adam could go lay their mack down on holli and some of her other friends. Well i think thats enuff for my exciting day.

      It really didnt seem like i was gone 2 weeks but i guess it was.  I had a blast with all the people in StoBro A.  I havent choked up or got teary eyed in a while but today broke that.   Its hard no too when u spend 2 weeks with strangers that become really close to you.  So i was really sad to leave and i miss it already.   I really miss all the people in TST and i cant wait for the reunion.  Well as far as Brit,  I guess i give up. Havent heard from her in a while and it would be pointless to keep on trying.  On a happy note i have a 360$ check waiting for me and my B-Day is right around the corner.  Ill ttyl, bye

      So after i get back from work at 7:30 today i slave over the computer WAITING for Brit to get on.  Dan said she was over at his house becuase she went to the movies with Justine.  So dan being the awesome person he is told her to get online when she gets home.  And that was about an hour ago and still no Brit.  If shes not on by like 12 or 1 im goin to bed and wont be able to talk to her till fall.  Im so freakin tired as it is right now so the odds arents looking very well.  I gues im gonna go.  Ttyl YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGG                                                       -Semper

      I have been sitting at this computer for the most hours straight than i have ever done before.  Im waiting for Brit to get on so i can talk to. I know when she does get on it isnt very often so i might aswell be here to talk to her.  I really hope she gets on later tonight so that i know im not wasting my time just sitting here.  Shes the only person on my buddy listen who when they sign on, makes a noise, so whenever i dose off and hear that noise i will know its her.  Sounds kinda corny but it help big time.  I will most likely be making an ass outta this whole ordeal but its worth a fight.  I have had to wait 2 times long periods of time today.  1. Waiting for the FedEx guys with my comp parts. 2. Waiting for Brit to get on which might never happen.  I know im just rambleing on but its either IM someone on Aim right now, or just talk to myself in here.  Daves acting different today, not in a bad way. Hes not his usual funny Dave, its the hey man how u doin i know how u feel kinda Dave.  Maybe he just wants me to turn gay so he can have his way with me, lamayo.  Well, i suppose its time to go wait some more.  I will most likely post again since i will prolly be bored. ttyl                                               -Semper

      So now that i realize how much i like brit, i cant.  She lives with her mom god knows were and never seems to be in Pinckney were i can see her.  So i find that likeing her is useless no matter how hard i try.  I havent said ne thing like this in ahwile because i havent met a girl with as great of a personality like her but it really sucks.  And dont even tell me that thers more fish in the sea because its been over a year and no bites.  So now im depressed and cant get her outta my head but i guess i will have to eventually.  Well i guess on a happy note, my comp parts are here and in good conditon.  Bye...                                                              -Semper

      So i have just about one of the best time of my life today.  After work i hung out with Westy and we wer invited over to Mr.Halls house to go swimming.  I will admit i was a little scared at first knowing there was going to be 2 beatiful girls there.  But when i got there i got a little loose....not in the ass.  Ne ways, i started to loosen up and have alot of fun.  We were over at alainas pool first with a bunch of people watching over us, then we decided to make a run for it and go to Brits pool, which was right next door, we all got out once and we wer all in there from about 7-10.  And it was a blast.  So im totally likeing Brit, even tho she prolly gonna end up reading this sometime soon.  So i can either make an ass outta myself, or just someone to talk to.  Hope all goes well either way.  Im out.                                                    -Semper

      It rained late last night and all this morning so i didnt have to work, which is cool in a way.  Its my last week for a while.  Im have a state board meeting to go to saturday and sunday.  Then on sunday im going right up to SpringHill for 2 weeks for TST.  I really dont care about working, im looking to work with the kids in StoryBrook and meeting some new people.  I could use a few more friends.  So right after i get outta SpringHill its right into drivers ed. Im somewhat looking foreward to it, but ide rather work for my computer than waste my time learning how to drive. Owell, i might get afew days in after drivers ed.  Then a few weeks after that, its Back To School. Things might be different this year so MAYBE i might have more fun.  So i keep meeting people over this blog stuff and its pretty cool.  The latest is Autumn, She seems pretty cool to me and she left a cool comment so it sounds like we have some stuff in common.  Well, i really dont have ne thing else to say ne more so ill wrap it up.  Goodday                                                                        -Semper

      The summer weekends are different from the school weekend.  School weekends you get to catch up on sleep and what not.  Summer weekend? nah, you work saturdays, and u get a sunday off.  I dont mind, im "Bringing in the cabbbage"?.  And it also took me about half hour to figure out who "ED" was, then my brain started kickn into high gear, and i finally got it. Sealed 5 driveways today.  Came home took a shower.  mom and step-dad left for upnorth to check on the cabin were building.  Then my dad came over, went to brighton, got chinese, went to bestbuy, got ice cream then came home. I bought some cooling system stuff for the comp, and i love it.  Im done for now, ttyl                                                                 -Semper

So last night me being the genious i am, got 2 monitors runnin off my comp.  3 hours and 2 retorepoints later i got it all under control.  Im workin tomorrow which is kinda hard to belive.  Then maybe im goin to hang out with my dad in Ypsi, i feel bad for the guy.  He had to go move in with some lady whose house hes been workin on. owell, hes safe.  He wants to take me to the elvis fest on sunday,  ahhaha, it sounds like uber fun.  Hes my dad, and i havent seen him in like 3 months so i dont mind.

      I gues im posting so soon due to popular demand, haha.  Sunday was alright, nothing really great happened and it was pretty boring.  We swam for 2 hours, the othe kids plated eucher which was a waste of time and then we started a movie.  Nothin really happened  really happened between me and Brit.  I dont know if she likes me or not or what.  Girls are confusing.  So i guess u can say that i had a good time.  When i got home and old friend said "Happy Birthday Chris....Well......3 days."  After she said that i was really confused until i realized that i had forgotton it was my birthday.   A kid.....forgetting his own birthday.  I just have had my mind on other things these past few weeks.  To me its just another day and shouldnt be recognized what so ever.   So my birthday is tomorrow and i had a chance to go to hooters whith the guys from work but i passed it up and slept all night.  I cant belive it, a 14yr old, forgetting his 15th bday and not wanting to go to hooters,  What is wrong with me.  Well  i passed it up kuz i had a really bad headache and i was tired.  So i went to sleep at 5pm and woke up the next day at 6am......i slept for 13 hours.  So today i had alot of energy and kept people laughin.  I guess im goin to dk right now with my mom for shits and giggles.  Ttyl.                                                                                               -Semper

      So i havent posted in a while but i spent my whole pay check.  I spent 182$ on this little electric crotch rocket.  It is by far my most favorite toy above all.  It goes 12mph and i ride it 24/7.  My bro got one too and we have been runnin around my driveway for hours at a time.  And on an even better note.  I found out that Brit thinks im a really sweet person and wants to get to know me before we go out and im goin to a pool party posibly this weekend.  Awesome? Yes? YEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH.  I guess im ending on a good note for once.  Ttyl.                                                                                                                            -Semper
