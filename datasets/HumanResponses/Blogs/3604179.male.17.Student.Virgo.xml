      Well, the inevitable happened today, we lost, but my softball team actually had a rally to make the game fun and exciting. The final score was 12-10. Seeing we were hitless through 2 innings, I felt it was a great night. Myself, I went 2-4 and got robbed in the 6th(our games our 7 innings). I saw the outfield had played me in, and we playing me to pull, so I hit one straight up the middle. The score was 12-10 at the time. Runners on 2nd and 3rd, and I hit it well. Too bad it was caught because the left-center fielder came out of nowhere and barely made the inning ending catch. I felt no shame though, I did the best I could. It doesn't help that in the bottom of the 7th 2 guys pop up in foul territory and then the 3rd grounds out to second to end the game. Oh well I guess, we did the best we could to make it interesting. 1-5 is our record. GREAT! Well I'm hoping work goes well tomorrow, and on Wednesday I can go hit up some fireworks. It outta be a great week. Another thing about softball, I am now hitting 8 for 12 which matches my season hit total from last year. I went 8 for 24 last year. Great to see I'm hitting a little better. Well I'm down to 11 or 12 dollars for the rest of this week. YAY! I think I'm going to cash in the change tomorrow sometime. Hopefully I don't go broke this week. Later everyone,  Big Pimpin' J (I wish)

      Wow, I'm tired. Well today I had a great migraine so all hell was breaking loose. I could actually feel the beating of my head like a heartbeat almost. I had a nice little fun time with that. I had 5 of my relatives over also this weekend. I always love that. Oh well, I guess, at least school's out and summer's going great. I couldn't catch the lunker today, I was disappointed in myself. I went fishing in a man made lake. Fun stuff. It was great. I haven't done anything worth while this summer yet. Looks like I need to head over to the dells or something. Well, good old softball tomorrow, hopefully it won't be as ugly as last week. I was about to off myself from last weeks debacle. I love the way our team bonds together to win. HAHAHA, wow. Hopefully we can score more than 4 runs tomorrow. I'll be happy to play at least. 1-4 is not a good record. Oh well, I guess, I'm out there to have fun. Too bad losing isn't very fun. I've kinda forgotten how good it feels to win. I'll update you on the situation tomorrow, hopefully no more migraines, that way I won't waste half my life sleeping away. I could use a woman right now, I'm very bored, and I know I won't be asleep until 3am. Cya later everybody, hopefully your summers not as depressing as mine has been. I think I'm going to go cruise grand for some ladies. Too bad none of them want me, it'll be a cold day in hell when I stop complaining about having no women. Wow, am I cool.

      Well I didn't make it to BWW for some 30 cent wings. Too bad, I missed out. Well today was boring, yesterday, I forgot to talk about this, but the cable went out. No Internet, NO TV! I almost died of boredom. I almost jumped for joy when it came back on today at 12, but 4 hours later, I had to go to work. Too bad, couldn't enjoy it long enough. Good thing next week I'll be workin' 12-4 instead of 4-8. YAY! Well I enjoyed it when I got home, and now I'm on the internet again. I'm still recovering from the UGLY game yesterday. WOW, I've had enough of that. I bought my mp3/cd player today, so that's exciting but other than that, my life is boring. SAVE ME FROM MYSELF! Well it's getting late, Hopefully tommorow will be a fun day. I need to get outside and run.   J

      Well, here I am, only one year away from graduation, and summer is finally here. Now that I am done writing school papers, rough drafts, algebra problems and such, I'm ready to sit down and write again... Interesting huh? My school year ruled, funny that I already miss it. Being at home sleeping till 12 works for me though. I got my first job last summer, my driver's license, my first car, the list goes on. This year was fun. Well the first part of summer has been cool. Laker's Suck, I'm glad they lost the finals. Hockey's over, too bad the av's don't have the cup. Oh well, The Brew Crew is off to a great start. People might say, oh there at .500 whoopee doo, but I like the fact that they are winning. I haven't seen a winning season that I can remember in my life for the brewers. Hopefully this will be the year. Well, as long as I'm on the subject of sports, I might as well talk about ultimate Frisbee(Which is a hardcore sport!) especially when you play it with 15 people. Great times. Yesterday I had my first fishing trip of the year. Too bad it was at a hatchery. We weren't supposed to catch Bass because supposedly they kill there young if you catch them when they're spawning, but unfortunately, I felt the big bite, and before I knew it, I held up a 18-20" bass which is probably eating it's young at this very moment since I put it back. Wow, aren't I smart. Well anyway, that's not where it ended. After the fishing, I got to play softball, OH BOY! Coming into the game, our team was 1-3(The win I wasn't there because of my awesome chance to play guitar in the school pop concert, which was very fun indeed) So I was hoping that I wouldn't experience another loss. Coming into the game I had went 5-7 with a double and rbi, and had made no errors in Left Center Field(For all who don't know, our league allows 4 outfielders) My dad is the manager of the team and also plays. He told me I would be sharing time with another player and would sit on the bench for 3 innings, GREAT! Well the game didn't start off too well. We went down 3-0 in the first, and a lot of controversial calls by the umps lead to some fuss. I am playing in a league full of people who range from 16-75. It can get ugly, and it did this Monday. We hit horrible, and one of our players got kicked out, and I made an error(WOW, you kinda knew it would happen eventually) You would have had to be there to believe it. We lost by the 12 run rule in the 6th, We suck. I vaguely remember the bloop single I had in the 6th inning which was my only AB of the game. It was quite embarrassing, but it's over now, and I have to let it go. Maybe next week we'll get a win for me FINALLY! Yea, I bet. Well I'm finally done writing this post which took me almost a week to do, I'm cool, I'm hoping to write more tomorrow, of course not as long. Have fun everyone, your finally done reading this.

      The Week: Tuesday - Work, Felt Great after a softball win, buffalo wild wings. Wednesday - Day off, bored. Thursday - Work, Fun playing PS2 at home, in other words, Bored. Friday - Finally did something fun, went to the dells. Stayed at a hotel, had some fun.  Saturday - Woke up having 5 hours of sleep, went mini-golfing, took 3rd out 4 people, ran out of money. Sunday - Back to Wausau, went to bourne supremacy. Good Movie, straight up great.  Softball Update - This week was the battle of the highlands... Rematch, after our great lost in 5 innings last time, we were looking for a better battle. After the first inning it was 1 to 0. Good game starting, but then... red started swinging and batted 9 runs to take a 9-1 lead going into the 6th inning. We hadn't hit all day, but finally we hit a little. 3 runs came in and the game was 9-4.&nbsp; We then shut the team down and went into the 7th down by 5, our team hit and hit and got it to 9-8. Our best hitter came up and popped up, it was barely caught, and the game was over. A good comeback, but coming up short. I was 0-2 with a walk. My average dropped to .500 so I guess it's not too bad yet. Oh well, a close game is better than a whooping.&nbsp; Better luck next week. My Indiana trip starts on thursday, I'll tell ya all about it later.

      Well, Tonight, Hell Froze Over, Our team stuck it to our opponent with a onslaught of hits. 18-10 was the final and I went 2-4 with an rbi and a run scored. We are now 2-7. We&nbsp;are coming back, WATCH OUT HIGHLAND RED. It's about time that both teams win though, our one win before this, the red team lost the same night. A great night for the teams. We have to face each other next week. The red team is superior, but if we can hit like last week, we'll win. I'm not expecting to win, but it'll be a fun game either way. I'm going to have fun watching the Family guy dvd right now, YEA!!!!! I'm a little happier tonight. JUSTIN "WE FINALLY TOOK IT TO EM'" HURLEY

       Well My Week Really didn't have a whole lot to it... On Tuesday night after an easy day at work I watched the All-stars battle it out. The brewers pitchers did well, two scoreless innings. The NL got smoked though due to the fact that Clemens didn't have his best outing and the Manager, Jack I can't I coach an all-star team Mckeon decided everyone of his Marlins should bat, what a DooshBag. On Wed, I didn't do anything special, I&nbsp;was merry. On Thurs., Work sucked as usual, Then I went up to Merrill to watch a baseball game and get some cheese curds. It was 8-4 the "good" team was losing when I left. Well with 1 inning remaining they came back and won. The team went on to win the tourney and go to state. On Friday, I went to Tony Roma's and hung out at the lodge. Fun Fun. On saturday, I helped replenish the driveway. I got 10 unexpected dollars for it so that was good. I also went golfing at 7:30 in the morning and shot a 59 on 9. I sucked, but my game had some high points, I almost chipped in from 45 feet away, and I putted well, but my driving.... it needs to be fine tuned. All my drives either went left or popped straight in the air and landed 20 feet past the women's tees. Well after that, Sunday came, I was on worship team playing guitar. Not exactly fun, but whatever, after that I got to watch the brewers stick it to the cubs AGAIN! They actually ended up splitting the series 2-2 with the cubs. I then watched some more baseball. Our church had a woodchucks game(The Wisconsin Woodchucks are a College Summer League Team)&nbsp;set up where we got free food and the ticket for 8 dollars. Good deal. The players did well and won the game 6-4. Although it was never that close till the last inning. Then Monday Came Softball.... I'll tell you about that later.

      I was too tired to write the softball update last night, so I'm going to do that for you all tonight. The Highland Blue Sluggers did it again, scoring 2 runs. Impressive! I went 1 for 3, not a bad night I guess. I just exceeded last years hit total in 8 less ABs. We lost 5-2 to a team we really should have beat. We made some solid defensive plays, and I thought it was going to be our night finally, but nope, our team couldn't hit anything... so we're 1-7. Highland Red lost to the only team we've beaten, so that kinda sucks, they are a better team by far, and should have beat them, but it was the same story. They only could manage a 6 runs and lost due to a rally it the 7th(last inning). Well, Better Luck Next week, Hopefully I hit a dinger, maybe that'll spark the team, lol. I wish I could hit a softball that far. I have fun no matter what happens, it just kinda sucks when you forget what winning feels like. Still a long way to go in the season. All-star game was fun to watch today, Sheets and Kolb together gave only 1 bloop-single up. Great job by both of them. Too bad Roger Clemens needed to not give up 6 runs in the first inning. I guess the brewers won't have home-field in the World Series, hahaha, I'm dreaming. Maybe a couple years down the road. This years team might make the playoffs, but I can't see them in the series, I will lose my mind if they do make the playoffs, that would be a dream come true. Well I'll write later, gotta go write my new story tenatively called "The Life." I'll tell you all about it when it's finished.   Justin "Slugger" Hurley

      Well, I have a lot to talk about in this week's post. Yup, I'm only going to do them every week plus a softball update.  If I have a big day, I will put in a extra one, but otherwise, forget it, It's too much work.  Last week was fun, First July 4th came, The fireworks were cool as usual. My mom and dad had there friends from indiana come. They have an 8 year old with an unbelieveable amount of energy. He kind of got annoying at times, but he's a cool kid and I dealt with it. We went boating the Saturday, and i went tubing(now that I look back, I would have much rather fished). My back was sore after that, wow.  On Monday, we had a day off from softball, and holy crap did we need it. I felt great. No losing today, but we get to play again tommorow and get crapped on. Well, if there's any team to beat, it this team I guess. I'm ready, problem is, who else on my team will be... Getting back to the week, The Brewers defeated the Cubs(YEA BABY!) 1-0 on a craig counsell home-run. The Cub fans at my house were disapointed, and made the excuse ben sheets was on the mound, and they would lose the rest of the games in the series. Tuesday, I accomplished what felt like nothing at work, I was just too excited for the brewers when I got home, and the REAL GAME on Wednesday. The Brewers Won Again, With Victor Santos on the mound 4-2. It was great. I couldn't wait for wednesday. We headed out at 2 to the game and got there around 5:30. We tailgated with subs(not a real tailgate, but good enough). I felt alone, there were 70% cubs fans their. I was ready for the sweep though. The Lowly Number Of Brewer fans that were there held up brooms in honor of in there minds an inevidible sweep. Well, I was hoping they'd win, but I didn't know. Our seats were awesome, above the foul pole, HAHAHAHA wow. It was ok though, what a rush. 43,000 others were around me. Doug Davis was on the mound for the brewers, and ended the inning quickly in the 1st. The brewers didnt do much either. In fact the game didn't get good till the 3rd. Lyle Overbay singled, and then ginter knocked him to second, and then wes helms brought him in making the game 1-0. Davis continued to be strong. in the 4th or 5th I don't remember, Craig Counsell singled, and then Geoff Jenkins came to the plate. he hit the ball higher than the stadium and then it seemed like it was going to be caught easily by sosa in Right Field. I couldn't see it from where we were standing, but then the Crowd erupted into a frenzy, i thought a good catch had been made by Sosa, but it was the brewers fans cheering, and bernie took the dive down the slide. A homerun, It was looking good! The brewers added one more run later, and Davis threw an 8 inning shutout, handing the ball to mike adams, a reliever, not Dan Kolb the closer, to end the 4-0 game. The Brewer Fans Stood up and chanted sweep as the ball went over the bat of the Cubs batter for strike three to end the game. What a game! I loved it. Our Friendly Cubbie fan that we brought along thought it as the most boring game he's seen. Me and My bro were lovin' it. As we made the trip home, I realized one thing, I had to work tommorow. Thursday, I worked in the truck for the first time in awhile. My work day sucked again. Friday, Same old $#!+ different day. At least I got to see king arthur and have some breakfast at denny's that friday night. Grand Slam Breakfast's for Dinner are freakin' good. Saturday, Sheets pitched his butt off and the brewers won again. Sunday, the brewers choked to end there pre all-star break record 4 games above .500 It's been a great season! Hopefully it will continue. I get payed tommorow, YES! I'll get ya the softball update tommorow. Also Sunday, I found a camera tape of some footage back in 8th grade that I have, SCARY! I was weird back then, I taped girls. I couldn't believe myself. I'm glad I don't do that dumb stuff anymore. It was a good memory though to look back on. 4 girls, 2 ugly, 2 hot. Too bad I haven't hung out with them since the beginning of my sophmore year. Maybe someday I will again, doubtful, but just maybe. One of em' I saw at best buy, but didn't realize it till I was out the door, I wanted to go back in and say hi, but... nevermind. I need to get some f***in' balls dammit. Cya everyone, Lata, J. Hurley

      Well I haven't updated for about a week so I have to force myself to write. Well, our softball team... jeez, on Monday, my brother had to play because none of our players showed up. Yes, that's right we had to play with 9 fielders instead of 10. HAHAHAHAHA, and to make things better, I played 2nd base!!!! HAHAHAHA, and my dad put our really 2nd baseman in the outfield. Well, you think it's over don't you. Nope, to cap things off, we were facing a team that has not lost! Yea, put that together and you have what happend, a 25-0 4 inning shutout. OUCH! I went 0-1. I made some plays at 2nd base, but our regular 2nd baseman wasn't exactly an outfielder... He dropped 3 very catchable balls. Oh well though, it's not like it mattered. we're 1-6 now. I'm just hoping next week we can win for once. After Monday though, my life became awesome. No, I didn't get a girl or anything. Just got to see Spider-man 2 at the opening show at cedar creek, 12am on wednesday. Fun stuff. I get to go boating tommorow. My dad's wealthy friend with his chevy surburban with dvd/game system players mounted into the seats for his kids, and the bose speakers came to town. (Very high up guy!) His boat is getting XM satellite radio put into it tommorow. Wow, I wish I had that kind of money, don't we all! Oh well I will just enjoy it while they are here, and hope I become as successful as him. I'm glad to be writing again, pray i get some lovin' this summer, Somethin' has to come up, I am feeling lonely. Oh well, 4th of july coming up, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS! I have my ammo all stowed away. My brother's friends dad is out of his house, and it's time for some explosives. Great show. Next wednesday i get to go to the Cubs Vs. Brewers. I am a huge BREWER fan, and I am hoping they destroy the cubs, but it will be fun either way. The brewers are in 3rd place as of Today(.5 games out of the wild card) YEA BABY. 5 game winning streak, it's a great feeling to see a team that has barely had 60 wins last season almost get to that mark by the all star break. 41-34, I'll take that anytime from the brewers who have went to the WS once! WOW, what a team. Let's just hope this is going to stay for awhile. cya lata everyone, ttyl. SAVE ME SOMEONE! J (Hopefully I can grow some bigger balls sometime this summer)
