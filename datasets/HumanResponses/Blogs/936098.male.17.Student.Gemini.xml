      Just recently, Sara's been getting emails from some Spanish guy or something, and then today I received an email from an Indian guy, talking about how his family leads a church there and is helping out his community a lot. It was a really long email, and it said his family encouraged him to be pen pals with me. Pretty funny. The subject of the email was "Dear Friend in Christ!" and he ended the email with "Thanking you." He also gave me this  urlLink URL which doesn't work , and I found  urlLink this one that does .&nbsp; In the mean time . . . Blogger is looking kind of flabby around the HTML, and I had a lot of fun in the past few days, despite the lack of sleep. I'm glad we got to hang out with Tim, Brice and Steve, although it wasn't for very long. I don't really have time to post in detail about that, or going to Sugarland today, but it was a pretty great weekend.  Does this blog exist? Is anyone reading this? Do you people think this blog is a waste and that we should just keep two old blogs? Does anyone other than Donna, Sara, and Ugly&nbsp;read this or intend on commenting, ever?

       This post is dedicated to the memory of Ronald Reagan, who passed away earlier this millenium. Thank you, Ronnie, for two great months of funeral memories and media exaggeration of the importance of your death. We are indebted to you for giving us something to fill our newspapers with.   For our English class, we were given two assignments to be due this week: a "narration essay" and a "description essay." Except, neither are really essays, and the assignment is a lot more strict than the names suggest. The "narration" secretly has to be something that happened to us, and it has to have a conflict, so it's a combination short story/memoir.  Then the description is really a description of a person, so it's actually a profile.  And he suggested combining the two assignments, so now it's a short-story-memoir-profile-essay.  And since each one was supposed to be 1Â½ pages, and he never gave us a real length requirement for the combination, mine is barely 2 pages.  I almost turned it in today but we have to have a rough draft so I'm changing five or ten random words in the story.  Yesterday, when we walked in the door Sara's watch turned to 9:41, and the class starts at 9:40 supposedly. The instructor called us late, then insulted us a few times. So today we walked in at about 9:31, and almost everyone was already there. Then, at about 9:33 he started calling role. Sara said "so apparently he calls role before the class even starts."  We've been trying to play DDR everyday, and we've been pretty successful.  I think Era is still my favorite DDR song--there are songs with more intense or difficult steps, but I really just like the song a whole lot. We've actually played a couple that weren't Abyss or .59. Exciting.

      The site lost about 27 MB of extra weight because I deleted so many images that had "_small" at the end, and some other unneeded stuff. I wasn't expecting it to free so much space. Unfortunately, it's taking 9,00 years to upload, so I'm going to go to bed and check it out when I get up.

      After we watched Vegas Vacation and left Sara's dad's house, we realised we had a lot of time, so we went to the beach and looked at the stars for a little while. We could only see half the stars because of clouds, and lightning was increasingly rampant. RAMPANT. There was a cop driving by, and then he stopped and turned around, so we thought he was going to steal our fireworks but he didn't. My hero.   Little did we know . . .   a few minutes after that we were wishing he had stopped us, because it started raining out of nowhere. And it wasn't pansy rain, it was Brazoria County rain, meaning raindrops the size of basketballs. We couldn't see a thing past the water. It was nearly impossible to know if we were headed out to the ocean or about to slam into a dune--the only thing we could see well enough to use as a point of reference was a trashcan, until another car appeared. We asked them how long until another access road, and they told us a couple of miles. The water was rising, and we were in it. Sara's car was repelling the basketballs pretty well, but her tires needed a miracle to . . . not . . . get stuck in the sandy mud. I thought we were going to be washed out to the ocean; the water was probably six inches deep at least in some parts, and it happened pretty instantly. We were trying to find an access road but it was impossible to tell if we were passing them because the rain was so intense. (If we had been on any other road we would have had to stop and pull over to wait out the intensity of the rain, but obviously this was the worst of our options at this point.) I decided we should pray, so we held hands and I prayed out loud that God would make us safe.  Less than ten seconds later , we saw the headlights of a truck on the access road, turned in, and followed the Bluewater Highway towards home.

      I'll go ahead and blog about yesterday's events.  We went to English and discovered that we have a different teacher. He's an older man that kind of reminds me of Mr. Hendrick. He seems nice enough, just a little talkative. After English I went home and cleaned my room/bathroom and took a shower. Then Mark and I went to my ( . . . ?) Nina's house to give her a bunch of shirts that Donna had asked me to drop off for her brother-in-law. While we were there we decided to pick up a few jigsaw puzzles because she is the queen of them. When I asked her if we could take two or three she said "Take ten!" so we took 15. That should keep us busy. After Nina's house we went to El Superior to eat cheese enchiladas for lunch. For 15 minutes we were the only people in the entire restaurant. It was really cool. I feel guilty for leaving so much queso left in the bowl. It was so delicious. We walked over to the Pet Shop to look at fish and aquariums because I'm going to buy one soon. Mark pet this hairy pig-dog thing almost the entire time because if he stopped it would bark at him. We went to his house and worked on  urlLink our website  for a few hours. And then we drove to my dad's house. We ate dinner and watched Vegas Vacation. I'll let Mark take it from here.

       (And then I remember purgatory.)  Today I listened to 106.5 a lot. I decided I like it better than 103.3 because it's more dramatic music, with less accordion. Less. We heard the word "corazon" (heart) in a song, and we both noticed it. I always point out how much they use that word in Mexican songs. Then, a Dr. Pepper commercial came on. (El sabor de la originalidad?) Somehow, they managed to say "corazon" in the Dr. Pepper commercial too. Then, on the way home, I left it on and I heard another song with "corazon" in it. Three in a row.  A pretty extreme storm happened lastnight, and I would blog about it but right now I'm going to clean my room. I just though that "originalidad" was definitely worth mentioning briefly.

      Sara, I don't have administrationalism on this blog yet, so we should fix that. (I'm mostly posting that so I won't forget.) Are the URL and title tentative? I think we could do better.  I just danced with a pool cue for a guitar, through all of Devil in Jersey City, by myself . . . again. What a hot CD.  I'm excited about cheese enchiladas for lunch.  All of a sudden it's raining, with I'm excited about cheese enchiladas for lunch. urlLink sporadic  lightning. I'm going to go ahead and turn the computer off . . . after Delirium Trigger ends. . . .  And this isn't a blog merger. It's a blog marriage.

      Yesterday I went crazy getting completely registered for the first semester of English IV at BC, and afterwards Sara went crazy changing to the English class that I was signed up for, so now we both have it from 9:40 to 11:09 every morning until early August. About ten minutes ago Chess said, "Happy summer. Enjoying no college?" I ran into my room and slammed the door.  The class was very easy today. . . . And since I don't know where my mom is or what she wants me to be doing right now, I'm going to post about it, elaborately. The teacher was completely new, and called it "Brazoria College" on accident, and then corrected herself. The teacher seems pretty nice, but at the same time relatively incompetent. Kind of like Mrs. Munson. Except Mrs. Munson wasn't very nice.   I think that people in general are pretty fascinatingly terrible so here are some interesting and excessively detailed descriptions of the people in our class: There's a woman in our class who's probably around 30 who told the teacher a lot of terrible stuff, since we spent the whole class period talking casually. First the woman went outside for a smoke break. Then she said, "You do NOT want to see me when I haven't been smoking." And she told us about how she had been smoking since she was 14, she spent her senior year in alternative, she knows where there are whorehouses in town, she did drugs and alcohol but found them less addictive than cigarettes, and then comes the most illegal part--they started talking about police, and the woman said, "how do you think I got off my probation early? You pay off who you gotta pay off." Everyone in the class was pretty disturbed and/or alarmed by her saying that, and she said it in a very matter-of-fact way, like someone would say, "my pickup was making fun noises this morning, and then I found out the fanbelt was loose."  The kid who sat in front of us was a senior at B'port, and he said that he was going to be a pre-med student, and then he cussed a few times, talked to no one, laid his head down like a kindergartener, and walked out twenty minutes early.  There was a girl who had made a face when she was three years old, ignored her mother's warnings, and got her face stuck that way. She was looking around the room while people were talking, and for the entire class period, her face seemed to say, "why isn't anyone licking my shoes?"  The guy who sat next to Sara was really goofy. He said he was home-schooled. He had his shirt tucked in, he was unshaven, and he had pretty big glasses. He was passing around the role sheet, and he slid it into Sara's water, which fell over, and he laughed in a really goofy way.  Well, I'm done talking about those people, and I'm pretty sure that was enough to keep anyone from ever looking at this blog again. So there you go.  Sara's at work right now, and I want to help my mom (who is home now) but she's on the phone, and has been for about ten minutes.  Who thinks that Sara's blog and my blog should get married? Any opinions? You wouldn't have to read about the same day more than once. Ehh? Ehh? Okay, I give up. I'm going to find something else to do.
