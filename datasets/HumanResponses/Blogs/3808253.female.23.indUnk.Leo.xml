						   Yes, you're supposed to analyze from "The pastel house by the shore" to the end of the novel.  Please remember to analyze, rather than simply giving your subjective opinion or reaction.  BH

						   The paper is on the passage that begins with "The pastel house by the shore" and ends with "such fine American beauties."  (last page of the book)  I believe he wants a reflection.

						   I don't quite see how the umbrella as a phallic symbol in this story. Suzy has always felt that Grace and her family had abandoned her, and now, as she is alone facing the rain and the indifferent world, her only protection is the stranger’s umbrella, therefore Suzy suggests the umbrella as a ‘weapon’. She is used to deal with her problems without asking help from her family, or sometimes, she would seek help from men like Damian, Michael,or Caleb. Being a loner in this world, the umbrella is her only shield and self-defense weapon. Therefore, Suzy feels safer after she took the umbrella, and ‘she can leave now, out into the torrential sea where her parents wait’.

						   Just wanted to know if there were any reactions to my reading of the umbrella passage.  Remember, it's Freud, not me, who says that umbrellas are phallic symbols! (bet you never thought of this, did you?)  Anyways, to recapitulate.  Freud says umbrellas are phalli, and that broken umbrellas are castrated phalli.  Suzy remembers that she has left her umbrella on the train...And when Bob makes the racist mistake of identifying her with Grace, she asks whether she left an umbrella there the other day.  Bob then lets her rummage through the bin where lost umbrellas are kept, and she chooses one, and this becomes "a weapon."  Two points.  First, if umbrellas are phalli, then they imply a connection with the girls' father and, by extension, Korea.  A lost or broken umbrella suggests a broken connection to family and to tradition.  Second, Suzy takes the "all Asian girls look alike" racist assumption of Bob and uses it as "a weapon."  If the broken umbrella suggests a lost tradition and the emasculation of Asian authority, then Suzy's appropriation of an anonymous umbrella and her use of it as a weapon is an affirmation of her identity.

						   I believe that stereotypes are everywhere and i agree with Professor Huang when he says positive stereotypes can also be looked upon negatively. For instance being a "model minority" is a good thing, looked upon as acculturating easily into the American mainstream, becoming successful easily, yet it is not as easy on the inside as it looks on the outside.

						   Hi All,  I realized upon reflection that the one paragraph I assigned for the second paper is a bit short, so I've decided to extend the passage to the end of the novel.  So the passage now begins at the same place "The pastel house by the shore" and ends with "such fine American beauties."  BH

						   We signed up for presentation dates on Thursday, week 1.  A lot of people just signed up for the date that they want to present and not the subject.  Some poeple did say what they were presenting on.  It looked like a lot of the dates were taken.  So if you were planning on doing a presentation with someone, that doesn't look all that possible because a lof of the dates were taken.  I think he said 2-3 people a day. The TA mentioned in section that each person was to present for about 15 minutes. Hope that helps.

						   Hi All,  One of your classmates emailed me a question regarding Monday's assignment.  I'm pasting my answer below...BH  Hi andy...Well, you can think of it as a compare/contrast if you want, but there are many ways of doing compare/contrast-- not necessarily Fanon says a, Sollers says x, Fanon says b, Sollers says y...Essentially I want you to think about what the two texts are saying about race and ethnicity and somehow put them together...You could, for example, interpret the Fanon through the Sollers text, using the Sollers as a lens...is Fanon's text a good illustration of what Sollers is saying, or not?  There are other possibilities as well.  As far as "Who is Ethnic?," it's an excerpt from the intro to a book, so it does end abruptly after three pages or so...   BH   ps I'm posting this to the blog so others may benefit as well.     -----Original Message-----  From: Andy  Sent: Jun 24, 2004 10:25 PM  To: jaygee@umail.ucsb.edu, benhuang@earthlink.net  Subject: summer 5        hey, I was just wondering if you could shed a little light on exactly what you expect from the first paper, is it compare/contrast?  What is the format.  Also, the article "Who is ethnic"....does that end after 3 pages or so like I think it does?  I only ask that because the supposed article that starts on 133 has no title and seems to start out of nowhere.  It has to be different, now that I look at it closer.....totally different article page #'s....so what is its title?? _Andy

						   This was an interesting film. This film reminded us of the roles Asian women play that I have glazed over for quite some time. I am just excited that Asian women have been able to break into the Hollywood industry and become successful. I feel that the Asian women play stereotypical roles because they have no choice but to take what they can get. I believe if they do not accept the roles provided, the director can easily find another replacement.  It really hit home to see how the random people walking on the street perceive the three Asian actresses. It confirmed the testimonies of women who claimed they received weird stares as if they were aliens when wearing Chinese customs or acting out Asian stereotypical roles.  This was a great film and I think this movie will get people to re-evaluate how we are perceived in the media and to question discrimination in society.

						   I choose to remain optimistic about the portrayals of minority groups in media culture and how they will evolve in the next few decades.  The media culture of today is, of course, driven by 40- and 50-somethings, but who is to say who will control the viewpoints once this (our) generation grows up?  I'm of the opinion that generalizations and stereotypes will further dissolve with the passing of subsequent generations.

						   Someone in class today said that the "MEDIA" reinforces stereotypes.  The "MEDIA" creates these stereotypes. I took a class on Chicanos/as in media last quarter and strongly recommend for further reading on how these stereotypes are created C. Ramirez Berg. The video in class today was very powerful.  Those three stereotypes of Asian women are everywhere pay attention!

						   Hey,  To those of you who are trying to save money on books, I was able to buy all five books on half.com for under $30 dollars. Because Professor Huang gave us the breakdown of what books we are going to read during what week, you should get most of the books on time. I thought this might be useful information to some of you.

						   Notes for today's lecture have been posted on ERES.  Someone came up to me after class today saying that he had a scheduling conflict regarding the section.  I wish to restate that attending section is mandatory.  If you cannot make it to the section as well as the lectures, you should drop the class.  Regarding pagination and the readers-- the readers have a table of contents which lists the authors alphabetically, then gives the reader page number the article starts on.  This is the easiest way for you to find each reading.  Please bring the text(s) we are reading to class with you on the dates they are assigned-- and also the following day(s) if we don't manage to cover them on that particular day.  Tomorrow's readings concern stereotyping and gender roles...feel free to post any thoughts you ahve regarding this.  BH

						   Just wanted to extend an apology to whoever it was who said that Ishmael was Abraham's son.  You're right.  John pointed out to me the next morning that in fact, Ishmael was Abraham's son by Hagar (I think that's her name)-- Isaac is his son by Sarah...BH

						   Prof. Huang,   My name is Shannon Wicks and I'm in your AA studies 5 class.  I'm having a mini- crisis.  I left my copy of "Eating Chinese Food Naked" at home on accident last weekend.  I went searching to buy another copy, but unfortunately have not found one in the UCSB bookstore, the Isla Vista Bookstore and all the borders bookstores from here to ventura.  I was wondering If you had any idea how I could get a copy of the book so that I can complete the writing assignment for next week.  Thanks,                                                   Shannon Wicks                                                    shanniew02@yahoo.com

						   We didn't get a chance to talk about Linmark's story today.  Perhaps it's just as well, seeing as few people had the reader.  But if you have any responses to the story, or to the other readings we've done so far, please feel free to the post.  I've also just put up the Sui Sin Far stories on the ERES website-- they should be available for downloading late this afternoon. BH

						   Here's the latest version of the presentation schedule.  Please note:  For T  7/8-- those doing Laundry-- there's actually a well known sociological study entitled, simply, The Luandryman, but it was written a couple of decades ago and I'd prefer if you could find more current information.  Also, can one or two of you also do something on Chinatown, Chinese Immigration, etc. in the early and mid-29th century?  Books by Ron Takaki, Sucheng Chan, Xiaojian Zhao, and a book called Longtime Californ' would be helpful here.)  For W 7/7, Carina is doing Chinese Lesbians (Asian Lesbians is fine-- you should be able to find stuff in a book called Q & A).  Nic, I've moved you to this day and would like you to do something else on the Asian gay community.  Frances has left you to join Amber, so you'll be Carina's teammate.    on R 7/8 Yangzhong, Regina and Wil-- I'd still like you to do Chinese Garment Workers-- but in your discussion could you also cover the action taken against Jessica McClintock?  For the following week-- I think there are too many people doing Disney Ethnic Characters?  Does anyone wnat to do research on Chinese opera?  BH

						   I&nbsp;thought it was &nbsp;interesting how Raymond feels uncomfortable discussing race politics with Betty,&nbsp;even though&nbsp;he&nbsp;&nbsp;did it constantly&nbsp;with Aurora. With Aurora, it seemed that he felt 'more Asian' than her, and therefore she needed to&nbsp;be taught&nbsp;how to become more Asian. (It's also interesting how Raymond doesn't seem to take into consideration that Aurora is also half-Irish, as if that side of her ethnicity is irrelevant or unimportant because it is 'white.') But with Betty, I think Raymond realizes that she has more 'ethnic clout' than him, since she herself immigrated from Vietnam, whereas Raymond is a second generation Chinese.&nbsp;And when Betty describes Aurora and Raymond as living in the same world, I think Raymond becomes aware of&nbsp;the flexibility and subjectivity of ethnic identity. Whereas before he viewed ethinicity in terms of either you're Asian or you're white, he now comes to realize that&nbsp;other factors contribute to identity formation as well, such as where you&nbsp;grew up and what sorts of experiences you've had. (Ie. Fighting in the war is not the same as living through the war.) This was my favorite&nbsp;section in the book because I felt that&nbsp;Raymond&nbsp;was humbled by Betty being 'more Asian' than him, and I think this was a factor in his abandonment of critiquing Aurora. &nbsp;

						   Hi All,  In response to a student query on how to prepare for the Final:  Anything is fair game, but if you know the novels really well you should dofine.&nbsp; Make sure you know the basic facts (characters' names, who did what,etc.).&nbsp; Also think of some of the major themes we've talked about.&nbsp; In the passage ID section and the essay section, we'll be looking for how you are able to interpret and integrate what you've learned...be prepared to compare texts...

						   i agree that a person needs self motivation to get into gang relatied activities.. but gabe was not that kinda person.. in the begining of the book he used to try to explain to Tomas why it was wrong... his conscience dint allow him to become like Tomas.. although he listened to Tomas all the time, dint mean he wanted to be like him.. he was the child who helped around the house.. who was alwasy there for his mom.. he was the good kid.. if it was self motviation then Gabe would have become a good person.. it had to be influence from an outer and closer source and the only source he had was Tomas.. so i dont know .. i still think Tomas influenced Gabe in become the way he is.

						   I am inclined to believe that Gabe needed his own motivation to follow Tomas (without incentive, he was no better than Tomas' attack dog).  When their mother's honor was under scrutiny, Gabe was more likely to lose himself in Tomas' world.  Regarding the entrance into a life of gang alliances and crime, a person needs to be driven by something (be it the desire to fit in, the desire to protect him or herself, etc.).  The yoga mom gave Gabe a reason to become an active participant in Tomas' crimes.  What do you think?

						   i dont understand why gabe leaves home.. and sells buster and takes tomas's car. is it becuz tomas beat him up or are their other reasons. ... to reply to teh earlier post about Gabe's behavious.. i think it was in him all the time.. but ti was supressed... although one mite think that Tomas was not reason it happened, he was a major part of this. he influenced Gabe alot... Gabe like wat tomas did, with the dogs and how he behaved so therefore he started behaving like that.. i dunno.. this is my opinion..hope it helps

						   Gabe's change of behavior didn't take me by surprise, because I suppose I saw it coming. The changes in Gabe are definitely drastic, but I doubt Tomas was the one that influenced Gabe; rather Gabe chose to make those decisions... what do you guys think?

						   Hey everyone! I just wanted to make a comment on the movie Better Luck Tomorrow, which I really like so far. I was wondering if anyone else had noticed that Stepahnie's family seems to be white: when Ben went to go study at her house a little boy with blond hair opened the door and when he was looking at a framed picture on her shelf it appeared that her parents were white too. This suggests that she's either adopted or a stepchild of one of the parents, which can be related to the situation in American Son, where the two sons are half-white, or not fully Filipino.  It seems like whenever we talk about issues of identity we assume (including myself) that everyone is either completely white, or completely Other.I wonder how Stephanie relates to other Asians and how other Asians relate to her because of her white family.

						   I think for the interpreter question that Suzy, as a girl had assumed Grace didn't know how to swim. Because&nbsp;Suzy didn't know how to swim, and they had supposidly taken&nbsp;classes together. (I think) &nbsp;Grace was such a mysterious person to Suzy, that it was hard to actually say something about her without hesitating. Suzy didn't realize until later, when she was told that Grace did know how to swim, that in fact she was a great swimmer.

						   well i was going back through the interpreter&nbsp;book for some reason and i got confused about the whole swimming deal with grace.&nbsp; earlier in the book suzy says that neither of the two had ever learned how to swim when they were with their parents.&nbsp; but at the end of the book all of a sudden we read in italics that grace was a great swimmer, that she could swim through any waters.&nbsp; so i am just a bit confused, was there a section in the reading that i missed?

						   This is in response to Prof. Huang's blog from last Thursday. I agree that aggressive anger does very little in the long term to resolve the issue of racial sterotypes. Chin's labeling of certain Asian American women as 'sellouts' seems odd to me, because it seems to ignore the fact that women did not create their own stereotypes either! She did not choose to be labeled as exotic and meek, and therefore shouldn't be seen as such just because she chooses to date/marry a white man. And as Cheung comments, Chin appears not to realize (or care) that his anger and insistence on 'tough' Chinese-American men, may drive a wedge between Asian American men and women by enforcing patriarchy. I can understand WHY Chin is angry, but I just feel that his rage is so misguided, and there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it...

						   Hey all, I just wanted to post a copy of an excellent 2nd paper for those who would like to see one. It's a good example of the depth of analysis and close attention to the text that we're looking for. john &nbsp; The Lost Swimmer’s Beacon  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suzy and Grace Park, the two sisters of Suki Kim’s semiautobiographical narrative The Interpreter, seemed to be coexisting distantly with parents in a country that was as foreign to them as the concepts of family and home.&nbsp; Suzy, whose perspective was presented in the novel, never quite felt entirely Korean or American.&nbsp; She was always perceived as the “other” by others and by herself.  "The pastel house by the shore.&nbsp; The sunlit faces of her parents."&nbsp; Suzy secretly coveted what other, seemingly assimilated Americans had, like her college roommate with Jen and her family’s East Coast home.&nbsp; Words such as “pastel” and “sunlit” suggest beautiful, picturesque scenes and radiant, smiling faces.&nbsp; Suzy observed none of that growing up, in a “house” that was always moving and parents who were always troubled.  "Not guilty, never guilty, never having crossed the line between what is family and what is not, what is right and what is deadly wrong, what is Korea and what is not home."&nbsp; The line, while being one defining other and same, encompassed all the turbulent aspects of Suzy’s broken life.&nbsp; Her family was distant, her family was doing things that were “deadly wrong” in the eyes of the Korean community, and neither Korea nor America ever felt like home.&nbsp; One was the source of the Park sisters’ otherness, and one was the geographical location in which they struggled to belong.  "The line was always there.&nbsp; The line had been marked from the beginning, tightly woven around the two girls who couldn’t find their way no matter how hard they tried."&nbsp; The “line” between who belonged and who was “other” was a vague, vexing construction that always made Suzy the other woman, the other race, and the other daughter.&nbsp; It was woven around her so tightly that she could never extricate herself from the status quo; she continued to be haunted and made restless by her otherness.&nbsp; Grace took a different approach to life and still never managed to find her way by overcoming the otherness that was manifest in her dual personalities.&nbsp; She was involved in her parents’ treacherous affairs yet was simultaneously always rebelling.  "...unless their parents went away, unless their parents sailed a boat never to return, unless their parents drove to work one morning and never came back… " Suzy’s quest for closure of the murder of her parents drove her to learn more about herself, about her family, and about her sister.&nbsp; She discovered motives behind her parents’ distance, motives behind Grace’s deliberate alienation from her, and motives behind her constant searching.&nbsp; The murder of her parents was the catalyst that initiated Suzy’s search for herself, and the murder of her parents forced her to look beyond constructs such as the line separating other from same.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At the end will be the lighthouse.&nbsp; At the end will be a new country.&nbsp; She could swim through any waters." &nbsp;Lighthouses exist as beacons to wandering ships, just as Suzy’s parents, their ashes scattered by the Montauk lighthouse, existed as beacons to focus Suzy’s misguided pursuits.&nbsp; Nobody was ever able to tell Suzy what she wanted, not even herself, but after she spent enough time searching for the clues to her parents’ tragic disappearance, she ended up finding explanations of things which defined herself.&nbsp; Solving her own life’s mystery and learning about who she was instilled Suzy with a new sense of family, new self-awareness, and new confidence to “swim through any waters.”  &nbsp; Thanks to Morgan for sharing this.

						   Hi, Just read the last two posts and wanted to respond. Oranges-- I thought it referred to Agent Orange, the cancer causing herbicide used during the Vietnam War.  Many people (Vietnamese and Americans) have suffered horrible effects from Agent Orange-- cancer, birth defects, etc. AA Men-- quite interesting comparison between AA Men and Af am women.  Chin's anger may be understandable-- but what are its implications?  If AA men feel excluded from patriarchy, then does aggressively trying to claim their share in it provide a viable answer?     Interestingly enough, alot of AA women complain that when AA men criticize them for going out with white men, the basis of the criticism is that AA women somehow are "THEIR (i.e. AA men's)" women.  The AA men, in contrast, argue that it isn't a matter of patriarchy or sexism, but one of assimilation-- that AA women who go out with white men are "selling out."     Ironically, Chin himself has a white wife...And Bruce Lee, the icon of Asian masculinity, also married a white woman.  Is there a double standard here?  Or is it okay for Asian men to go out with white women because that's somehow breaking a stereotype, whereas the reverse simply reinforces it.       Read the Cheung article for the literary ramifications of this.  Also, stay tuned for American Knees!  BH

						   Hey guys. I was just thinking about the article by J. Chan (Contemporary Asian American Men's Issues). The plight of Asian American men reminded me of something that I learned about in a Women's Studies class: the plight of African American women. African American women feminists were misunderstood by white feminists because of cultural and racial differences. But they felt they were also being oppressed by African American men in the struggle for civil rights because of patriarchal structures. The same thing appears to be happening with Asian American men. They are excluded from patriarchy because of certain stereotypes that depict them as passive. But they also seem to have issues with Asian American women, who they believe might be selling out or propagating certain stereotypes. This separates them from the two groups they would seem to have the most solidarity with (males and Asians).  I thought this was really interesting because I never thought of males as being oppressed before...so I can kind of understand where Frank Chin's anger comes from....

						   GOod day everybody~!!! As I was catching up on my reading (hehehe) for Donald Duk, I was trying to figure out the meaning of the "orange" that American cong referred to that was in his heart. I'll take any thoughts or comments but wait, am I going to be able to figure it out throughout the novel? If that is the case hush hush~~ if not please share...  Thanks~!!!

						   Hey...has anyone finished reading Eating Chinese...? i don't think I really understand what the trip to Florida is supposed to symbolize. Is Bell using it as a form of escape from her marriage? Or does she just miss having Ruby around the house as her little girl? Also, is Ruby torn between her Chinese and American identity or is she just undecided about her relationship with Nick? Or are these two situations intertwined? Let me know what you guys think...

						   If any of you guys want to view the panoramic movie for yourselves, it's in my directory at http://uweb.ucsb.edu/~morganism/school/laundry.mov  You have to have the latest Quicktime plugin, and you just click anywhere in the image and drag it around as though you were looking around 365 degrees!  :)  I think it's kind of neat, anyway...

						   Dear All,      Linda has generously given us permission to reproduce her Assignment One, which John and I both thought was outstanding.  BH     Linda Ngov Huang/ Gamber Asian American Studies 5 06/28/04		               Is Everyone Ethnic?  	If ethnicity is nothing but a term used to differentiate people, is the body also a basis of differentiation?  If so, then Werner Sollors’ thesis that everyone is ethnic becomes problematic.  The reason being is that according to Franz Fanon’s essay, “The Fact of Blackness,” the body, particularly the black body, is the site of alienation.  Hence, if the body is indeed an ethnic factor, then the usage of ethnicity has negative connotations.  In other words, when looking at the term ethnicity, one cannot ignore that it means to describe the “Other.”  However, because Sollors asserts in “Who is Ethnic,” that ethnicity is a universalist term that includes dominant groups, he underemphasizes the negativity that is associated in the usage of ethnicity.    	To Sollors’ credit, his investigation on the historiography of ethnicity does highlight how ethnicity is often used to mean “nonstandard.”  He mentions that even by the mid-nineteenth century, when ethnicity was finally defined as a person’s particular race or nation, the word was still only used to point out a person’s difference to the dominant group (Reader, 130).  With the acknowledgement that use of ethnicity often coincides with discrimination, race, manifested by the body, must be included as an ethnic factor.  Fanon explains the experience of being trapped in a body that is racialized.  He states, “In the white world the man of color encounters difficulties in the development of his bodily schema…A slow composition of my self as a body in the middle of a spatial and temporal world—such seems to be the schema.  It does not impose itself on me; it is, rather, a definitive structuring of the self and of the world-definitive because it creates a real dialectic between my body and the world…” (Reader, 95).  Ethnicity is the dialogue that differentiates the “Other” from the dominant and the racial body is the feature that places a person into the category of the “Other.”  Since the colored body is registered as different to the white world, race, as an aspect of ethnicity, is negatively viewed. 	The understanding that ethnicity has negative connotations is lost though when Sollors argues that dominant groups are also ethnic.  One reason that he gives for his argument is that ethnic studies have emerged from the Afro-American Civil Rights Movement and that “an omission of the Afro-American tradition in a discussion of ethnic culture in America would create a serious gap in our reflections” (Reader, 131).  This statement is problematic because as we have learned from Fanon, African-Americans are not part of the dominant culture.  In fact, their colored bodies make them ethnic because they are different from the preferred majority (whites).  By absorbing African-Americans into the dominant group, Sollors removes the injury that comes from being ethnic.
