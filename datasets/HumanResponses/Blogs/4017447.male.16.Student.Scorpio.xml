        "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the  selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity  and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is  truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike  down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to  poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay  my vengeance upon thee."

I mean, the graphics are spiffy and sound is engrossing. I even jumped the first 8 or 9 times a monster jumped out at me. But after an hour and a half of the *exact* same thing, it begins to wear thin.    The description of this game was right, a remake of the original Doom, with new graphics. That's it. Nothing new in terms of gameplay. Sneak around. Get spooked. Empty your clip into a zombie. Move on to the next room. Ho-hum.    Glad I "tried it before I bought it."
