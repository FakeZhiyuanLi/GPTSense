      Hey Folks,   Welcome to my blog, (one of those high tech type things that I picked up in my government days). On this blog, I'll try to post on a more regular basis than my mass e-mails stories of my adventures and such from around the world or at home...we shall see, so on with the blogging.   Take care,  Noah

      A favorite song of mine, all that is wrong with society summed up in a beautiful spoken word poem (Take that suchy):  DJ Vadim ft Sarah Jones - Your Revolution (DJ Nappa Remix)  [Verse] Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Not happen between these thighs Not happen between these thighs The real revolution ain't about booty size The Versaces you buys, or the Lexus you drives And though we've lost Biggie Smalls Baby your notorious revolution Will never allow you to lace no lyrical douche, in my bush Your revolution will not be killing me softly, with Fugees Your revolution ain't gonna knock me up without no ring And produce little future emcees Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not find me in the backseat of a jeep With LL, hard as hell, you know doin it and doin it and doin it well doin it and doin it and doin it well, nah come on now Your revolution will not be you smacking it up, flipping it, or rubbing it down Nor will it take you downtown or humpin around Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs Your revolution will not have me singing, ain't no nigga like the one I got And your revolution will not be sending me for no drip, drip VD shot And your revolution will not involve me, feelin your nature rise Or helping you fantasize Because that revolution will not happen between these thighs No no, not between these thighs Oh, my Jamican brother, your revolution will not make you feel bombastic And really fantastic And have you groping in the dark for that rubber wrapped in plastic You will not be touching your lips to my triple dip of french vanilla,  butter pecan, chocolate delux Or having Akinyele's dream, m-hmm a 6-foot blowjob machine m-hmm You want to subjugate your queen? uh-huh Think I'm a put it in my mouth, just cuz you made a few bucks? Please brother please Your revolution will not be me tossing my weave And making me believe I'm some caviar-eating ghetto mafia clown Or me giving up my behind, just so I can get signed And maybe having somebody else write my rhymes I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown You know I'm Sarah Jones, not Foxy Brown Your revolution makes me wonder, where could we go If we could drop the empty pursuit of props and ego We'd revolt back to our Roots, use a little Common Sense On a quest to make love De La Soul, no pretense But your revolution will not be you flexing your little sex and status To express what you feel Your revolution will not happen between these thighs Will not happen between these thighs Will not be you shaking and me *yawn* faking Between these thighs Because the real revolution, that's right I said the real revolution You know I'm talking about the revolution When it comes, it's gonna be real It's gonna be real It's gonna be real When it finally comes When it finally comes It's gonna be real, yeah yeah http://www.thetastates.com/lyrics/dj_vadim_ft_sarah_jones-your_revolution.txt
