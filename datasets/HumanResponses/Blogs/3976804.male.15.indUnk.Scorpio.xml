       Today I was busy, but I never left the house. That hardly ever happens! If I'm busy, then I'm usually out doing stuff with friends or what not. But today, I had stuff I wanted to do around the house so this was a new experience for me. So ya I woke up at 11ish and ate my cereal (the breakfast of champions). Then I kind of bummed around. Watched tv and stuff. But around noonish, Elijah and I decided to clean the kitchen for mom. What the heck. We didn't have anything  else  to do haha. So we did that and it took  forever . We had to hand wash TONS of dishes and stuff and then had to clean off all the counters and stuff which had been pretty junked up in the past couple days (no thanks to Elijah and I&nbsp;leaving everything out that we had used in the kitchen that day haha). So after we did that, I read some more of my summer reading stuff. Then we decided to go ask this kid that lives across the street from us to ride bikes. He's  really  quite and shy and doesn't have alot of friends so we decided he might like it if we asked him to do something. So we rode bikes for a while and then came home and ate.....SPAGHETTI. Probably my&nbsp;2nd favorite meal ever. Lasagna comes in at an easy 1st. So ya and then Elijah and I had a vicious Nok Hockey tournament. And if you don't know what Nok Hockey is......then too bad because I'm not explaining it haha. It was really kinda funny actually because I broke one of the pucks in half lol. I banged my stick on it and it just split in two lol (I'm telling you, I wasn't  born  with these massive muscles). Good thing we had&nbsp;a spare puck. So we were able to continue our tournament. And I'm not going to say who won.......because its my blog and I can say what I want ha! So after that, we went outside and did a white boy And 1 session. It was amazing I tell ya. AMAZING. You would think we were black if all you&nbsp; could see was our moves and not our skin. And here I sit, telling you about my incredibly cool life. Well I'm done here

        Yesterday was a good day. I&nbsp; wasn't overly busy, but I didn't get overly bored. So I had a good balance. I woke up at 11:30 and hopped in the shower to get ready for this little SLU reunion thingy that we had. So Casey picks us up at like 12 and we went to the thing. Well since like half of our school was at camp with FBCEuless, it was me, Elijah, Danielle, Casey, Kirsty Wallace and Matt Dickey lol. So it was&nbsp;a  very  small crowd. But it was good. So we got home at like 3ish and kind of just hung out until 6 and went to church to set up tables and chairs and crap. It was  pouring  rain and Elijah and I didn't think anyone was gonna show up because it was like 6:35 and NO ONE was there yet haha. So we kept joking that it was gonna be just our family so we would have plenty of room to eat lol. But people started to&nbsp;come so our theory (or as Brian puts it, theroy lol) was ruined. Well, normally after we all eat, Elijah and I go outside and ball it up with all the guys from church and its really fun because none of them play sports so we look like we are halfway decent against them lol. But no diss to my church boys. Just making a point. But anyways, ya we go out there to play basketball and its still raining like crazy but we didn't care so we went out there and ended up playing for like an hour and got soaked to the bone. On the way home we had to return Driver 3 to Blockbuster so I go in with soaking wet clothes and everyone kind of stares at me weird when I go in. I had on a white shirt too so people were probably just gawking at my massive pecs. But anyways, I walk up to the counter and was like "ya this is late so I have money to pay the late fee." And the guy was like "uhh ok thats gonna be $6.75." Well I only had a 5 dolla bill so I had to go back in the soaking rain and get an extra dollar and 75 cents from mom and go back in and pay the dude. So I finally get that done and come home to a night of tv and reading lol. Thats what I like to do when it rains. And unfortunately, one of the downsides to having a sattelite dish is that the signal goes out when it rains alot. So tv was crossed off my list so there was nothing left to do but go back in my room and get some reading done. So that was good. I got some catching up done and it was nice. And ya I couldn't really go to bed for some reason so I kept getting up and reading some more to try to get myself to sleep. So ya thats all that happened yesterday. I guess I'll put something up tonight about today since you all care so much haha. Well, I'm Micah, and you stay classy San Diego.

       Well today was an eventful one. I had to wake up at 9:30 which is freakin early for me, and do yardwork and laundry. So I had to eat my honey nut cheerios, stick a load of laundry in, and go whack weeds. But I had to keep coming in every 30 minutes to switch out the laundry piles. Like take the clothes out of the dryer, fold them and put the wet clothes in the dryer. And then I would have to put a different load in the washing machine. Aren't I just the cutest little thing? Doing laundry and everything. So ya I had to tear Elijah away from his precious IM conversations and get him to fold laundry while I finished in the yard. Then I had to come back in and vacuum because my dad was having some meeting that night. So I vacuum and then make Eli go do his part in the yard while I took a shower so my dad could take me to go see a movie at my youth pastors' house. So then I went and saw Gladiator at my youth pastor's house with some people from church. Ya I like going over there because he works for Sarah Lee&nbsp;so they have TONS of cookies and biscuits and just anything having to do with dough lol. So I never go hungry and its&nbsp;very nice. I had kind of seen Gladiator before but I wasn't really paying attention cuz I was at a birthday party and we were all hyper so this was technically my first time to see it and it was really good.&nbsp;So the movie ends and Heather, my lovely friend from church, takes me to Casey's house. So we hung out at her house and watched In Living Colors which is some old sketch comedy that Jim Carrey used to do and its pretty funnny.Then we went and saw Anchorman. Which by the way is freakin hillarious. Nothing quite tops Napoleon Dynamite though. So ya I don't really know what else to say. I'm just rambling most of the time anyways but now I am totally doing that. Well I'm tired. I'm out yo

       Well yesterday I woke up at 9:30 so I could have time to do 2 loads of launry an yard work only to find out that I didn't even have to do my yardwork. So I guess that was nice. So I get all the laundry done and pack my bag and head off to Marble Falls to see all my old buddies. So we get in the car to meet my friend Taylor halfway. But, before we can do that, we have to go try to get Eli's flip-flops only to find out they had dissappeared lol. So we get into Marble Falls at like 5:30 and eat dinner and then go to Taylor's play practice. Come back home, eat peaches and ice cream and then play video games, mess around on the guitar and talk to people so it was pretty fun.  So ya now today we woke up and ate breakfast tacos and have been playing pool and Driver 3 lol. We finished up the night with pool, Halo, Red Aler 2 (which I don't play, I just sabatoge the other players) and finally, Goldmember.

       I didn't get a chance to write yesterday but not much to talk about except for one thing so I won't bore you. Ben came over and we had a good time. Got semi-hyper and just had a good time being together again. I hadn't seen him hardly all summer.   Well today I went to the eye doctor in Dallas. To be specific, Texas Retinal Associates. So you're probably wondering why I went to a retina specialist. Well it's because last summer I started hemoraghing (I know thats mispelled, but it means bleeding) in the back of my left eye. So ya the blood like blocked all my vision so I couldn't see. And its been a problem this whole year and to make a long boring story a  short  boring story, I found out today that my vision isn't getting any better in that eye. It kinda sucks because I already had terrible vision before, so now I have a whole new obstacle as far as it comes to every day reading and basic stuff like that. So ya if you ever see me sitting 2 inches away from a tv, its because I'm legally blind lol. So yes that was my adventure for the day. I was pretty happy today because normally it takes like 3 hours for me to get out of there and today it was only 1 hour so I was glad not to waste an entire day at a freakin doctors office with a bunch of old people. Apparantly, the condition I have is normally developed by OLD people lol so ya. It's like being in a retirement home because me and my dad are like the only ones who can breathe on our&nbsp;own&nbsp;and walk without something by our side lol. Ya my dad looked pretty young and hip in there. I was proud of him lol. Well thats about it. To whoever actually reads this, thanks for reading my thoughts haha. Ok I'm out!    &nbsp;

        Well, to start things off I just wanna say that I&nbsp;don't even know if anyone is gonna read this mug, but I just like to write stuff so bear with me here. Well today&nbsp;I saw like the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's called Napoleon Dynamite. And it's about this nerd kid and ya its just freakin hillarious. So that was really funny. I'm glad I had Ben next to me laughing at everyting even though he's seen it like 4 times already lol.&nbsp;Nothing really profound for the day but I'm sure I will have some coming up haha. &nbsp;
