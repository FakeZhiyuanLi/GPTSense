        It's awful.  I'm going for it full time this semester, but that means I'm taking five classes. I have a class on Monday night from 7-10 PM, a class Tuesday morning from 11-1, a class on Wednesday morning from 9-12 and again from 7-10, a class on Thursday from 11-1 and again from 7-10.  I get Friday off, w00t!  But yeah, with the commute and all, this  sucks .  I'm going to be gone all day Tuesday and Wednesay, it doesn't really make sense to try to come home in the middle of the day, I'm not sure that'd even be possible!  I'm going to try to get an internship or a volunteer gig or something for those two afternoons a week that I'm going to be stuck there.  Or else I could just go and do homework during that time.   So I have to figure out my overall schedule for next semester.  Since I'm getting a laptop, I think I still will be able to do some work during that time period, but I don't know....let's see:  On Monday, I guess I'll get up around 6:00 to go running, then I'll come in at 7 and do weights or stretching or Pilates. At 8:00, I'll eat breakfast, shower and get dressed.  Then I'll go upstairs and work until noontime.  At noontime, I'll go out running again or I'll go practice soccer or shoot some hoops or do SOMETHING for an hour and I'll eat lunch, too.  Then, at 1:00, I'll work again until 5, when I leave to school.  I'll get home and go straight to bed.  Tuesay is an easy day.  I'll get up at 6, run, come in at 7, do weights/stretch/pilates.  At 8, I'll get ready for school.  I'll get out of school at 1 PM, come home, go to soccer, eat dinner, do Monday's homework and work until bedtime.  Wednesday is a very long day, I will not shower and I will eat in the car.  Get up at 6, run, and go to school.  Get out of class at noon, eat lunch.  Do homework from Tuesday. Finish homework around 3, do something productive until 7, go to class, come home and go to bed.  Thursday is another long day, I'll get up at 6, run, come in at 7 and do weights, stretches or Pilates.  At 8, I'll go through my routine and leave for school.  After class, it'll be 1:00, so that leaves six hours.  I'll eat lunch, I suppose and then I'll work Wednesday's homework assignments. Finish homework at 3:00, then do something productive until 7:00. Class till 10, come home, go to bed.  On Friday, I'll get up at 6, go through my ususal routine, do Thursday's homework, work until 4 PM, play soccer, eat dinner, and work until bedtime.  Saturday - Sleep in, and all day work.  Play soccer. Go out and have Social Life at nighttime.  Sunday - Sleep in, all day work.  Work on Personal Hygiene such as repainting nails and such.  That's do-able.  That's not so bad!  .

      My brother shaved his head last night. He shaved the front of his head completely, but the back of his head still has hair (I guess he couldn't see that well), so he has the weirdest look now. HAHAHA. His head was all cut up and bleeding from the razor, the worst shaving job I've ever seen in my life. He's really sad because he's losing his hair and he's only 22 years old, but what can you do about genetics?     I went swimming this morning. It's so very energizing to dip yourself in freezing cold water first thing in the AM. I'm still wet, though.     Perhaps you're wondering about my blog title. Well, "tyler4president" is my username elsewhere, generally on the Aerosmith message boards. And I really believe strongly that STEVEN TYLER SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! What a great leader of the free world he'd make! Aerosmith could play the innaguration! = ) For once there'd be decent music, right? He'd give his state-of-the-union address from a scarf-draped microphone. And there'd be no scandal or guessing about his drug-addled past, since it's all so out in the open anyway. I was going to start a campaign to see how many Aerosmith fans I could get to write in Steven Tyler's name on the ballot in 2004 if nobody decent was going to run. I firmly believe that democracy is all about voting for who you REALLY WANT and that it's stupid to vote for the lesser of two evils or to vote for one guy just to shut another out. I started the whole "Tyler4President" thing to show people that our election system is a moronic joke and so I could thumb my nose at "democracy," but then Ralph Nader threw his hat into the ring this year, and I kinda really do want Nader to win, so I'm going to vote for him and you all should too if you like him well enough. DON'T VOTE FOR KERRY JUST TO GET BUSH OUT OF OFFICE, THAT'S NOT WHAT DEMOCRACY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT.    I have no profound thoughts for you at this time.  Perhaps later, after I've eaten something.      My big plans for TODAY include:  -Returning books to the library.  - Doing some work  - Going and getting an ice cream cone (blueberry?)  - Working on my index so I can release it finally  - Watching the democratic national convention, fun.

      I went to the beach all day today. And I have a horrible sunburn, too.  Sex.  I suggest that you read  The Naked Ape  by Desmond Morris to get a basic idea on what I think about sex. I really like that book a lot - although it is dated, and you can tell that he came up with a lot of his ideas in the 1950s, I think it's the only book that takes an objective look at human behavior. Morris tries to help you to step outside of humanity and look at our species as if you were a naturalist or a zoologist observing the behavior of any animal in its habitat. A lot of other attempts to talk about the behavior of human beings get screwed up by all our self-glorification. I love the  Naked Ape  because Morris tried so hard to steer clear of that.  Anyway, read that book. Sex is a completely morally neutral biological function. Like eating or sleeping or going to the bathroom. It is not inherently wonderful, it is not inherently wrong. It's neutral, it just exists, it's a fact of life. Humans have sex in order to perpetuate the species. No, God doesn't think that sex is evil or sinful. This is how most of the more complicated creatures on earth go about the business of reproduction. Sex is a function of the body. That is all.  Humans, however, attatch special meaning and a lot of weight to the sex act because of our niche in the ecosystem and the way that we've evolved. Unlike most primate species, we have a very strong tendency to form pair-bonds. You can't just undo several million years of biological programming because you've decided that monogamy is repressive! In virtually every mainstream culture on earth, pair bonding is the rule. In some societies, you may have multiple wives, but you can't have sex with just anybody. Having indiscriminate, casual sex has been generally frowned upon since the beginning of history! This suggests that there's something deeper than arbitrary social rules at work here. There's a good reason for the human instinct to form pair bonds - humans have a very lengthy period of infancy. A typical chimpanzee reaches full brain development in three years. It takes a human 22 years. A human female is sidelined for  years  caring for her young. You can see why it's so important for the male to be involved in rearing. Do the majority of human females find it at all easy to raise a child without a partner? No, because it's so contrary to our biological programming. Humans have a deeply-rooted biological drive to mate exclusively. This is why we've developed so many emotional feelings about the act of sex.  It's not fair to compare humans to other animals, because other animals occupy different niches, play different roles and have evolved differently depending on what has worked best for them over the ages. Exclusive mating has worked for humans, but it's not for animals like cats who are solitary hunters and whose offspring are grown in a year. Cats don't seem to attatch much feeling or emotion to sex, because they don't need to. Cats attach A TON of importance to the act of hunting and killing, because they have to. Every species has its own thing. The fact that we attatch great importance to sex is an idiosyncracy of our species.  So sex is a morally neutral act. Like eating. But there's a huge difference between eating to ensure your survival and stuffing down a dozen donuts in one sitting. The same applies to sex. Having sex is fine. Having indiscriminate sex with every member of the opposite gender you come across is quite another matter. You don't need to eat a hot-fudge brownie sundae just because it's there. Likewise, you don't need to have sex with the cute guy at the party just because he's there. IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF CONTROL!  I honestly feel that we live in a very sexually repressed society. I think that all this obsession with sex is a compensation for that. Don't forget, this country was settled by Puritans, and I think that the "Puritan" mindest is so deeply entrenched in our whole way of thinking. I think that there's very much a sentiment that sex is "forbidden" and "wrong," and ooh, if you have sex, you're doing something NAUGTY! It's so weird, like porn mags and sex shops, it's always like "Ooh, satisfy your naughty secret pleasures!" What on earth is so "naughty" about sex? If sex were just more out in the open and if people accepted that it was just a biological function, a part of life, like anything else, we'd probably be far less obsessed with it than we are.  I always hear "If you were at ease with your sexuality, you'd be having a lot of sex. People who don't have sex are repressed." But part of being an empowered woman at ease with her sexuality is understanding that sex is a profound act of expression that is special enough that it ought not to be shared with just anyone with a penis. I don't think that abstaining from sex makes neccessarily makes you a loser or is neccessarily a sign of insecurity or fear. It can be, but on the contrary, I think that very often, excessive casual sex is an indicatication of low self esteem...having sex does indeed affirm your sexual attractiveness and lovability, at least for awhile.  I really have no problem with premarital sex as long as you're in an actual relationship. I think that being married first is probably better, because you've got to be pretty darn committed to take that kind of a plunge, but, no, you're not going to HELL if you have sex with your fiance or your serious boyfriend. However, I don't think that empty sex neccessarily adds anything to your life at all.  Having sex to keep a guy is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.  There's no rules for what makes a relationship work out. Some people have sex on the first date and they stay together for the rest of their lives. Some people date for five years, then they finally have sex on thier wedding night and they're divorced a year later. So "doing the best thing to make a relationship work" shouldn't be the main factor in deciding whether or not to have sex with someone.    "I know some girl who waited two years to have sex with a guy, and then he dumped her right after." Okay, then, so she found out he was a jerk. Good thing she found out, now she's free to find somebody better. That's not a reason to rush into sex early. He still would have been a jerk if she'd slept with him after two weeks. A jerk is a jerk, you can't engineer your sex life to de-program jerks and make them love you.    You can't make anybody like you or love you. Either he loves you or he doesn't. Jumping in to sex too soon or putting it off too long isn't going to change that.   <>Really, I don't know why some girls are so concerned with "keeping" guys. If he's worth it, he'll stay. If he's not worth it, get rid of him. There's no reason to fuck around wasting your time. Say "Oh, well, I had sex with a loser," then pick yourself up and find someone who's not a loser. Believe it or not, there are plenty of guys who aren't losers.  "Well, look, if you don't have sex with me, I'm going to get another girlfriend!" To which I've said "Okay then, it was nice to know you!" I mean, hello. Why even waste time with a guy like that? There are thousands of men out there. I don't understand why women waste time pining over men who are assholes! And don't even tell me "All men are assholes." I know  many  men who are really good people. My brother, my father, both my uncles, all of my cousins, the majority of my closest friends, online and off. They're out there, you just have to look for them.  And last of all, it's really about being able to practice self-control.  ------------------------------------------- WE LIVE IN THE MOST GLUTTONOUS, OUT-OF-CONTROL SOCIETY. --------------------------------------------  Sex, being a basic biological drive and all, is one of the basest aspects of our nature. Much like eating, peeing or sleeping, it's not very "highly evolved" to devote vast amounts mental energy to thinking about it. We're so into this self-glorification, but when you look around, there are an awful lot of humans who are mainly preoccupied with eating and reproducing themseleves.  There are so many other things to think about and do. No, sex isn't the highest glory to which man can aspire. No, it's not the funnest thing ever in the world, although, like eating, it certainly is quite enjoyable because it satisfies an important biological drive. I'd be lying if I said I didn't really love sex or if I didn't really love eating nice ice cream sundaes, but sometimes you have to know when to say "I don't really need to have sex right now." And you have to realize that it's a base, animalistic drive, it's not exactly the pinnacle of the human experience.  I don't think that orgasm is the best physical feeling in the world. It's second. The BEST physical feeling in the WHOLE WORLD is the feeling that you get in the bottom of your stomach on a roller-coaster drop. Whhoooo yes!  I need to get myself to Six Flags before the season is over.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MORE FUN THINGS FROM DEEP WITHIN THE BOWELS OF MY FREEWEBS ACCOUNT.    Here is my friend Justyn with Steven Tyler.  This is his sig pic.    Lol, Jarod was having fun in Photoshop and he turned Brad into the Statue of Liberty.    This is one of my sig pics, it's an MSpaint "drawing" of Aerosmith.  Aren't I talented? Yup, yup.     Haha, another sig pic I have.  This is a popular saying among Aerosmith fans.      Joe Perry's hot sauce, haha, the first time I saw it on the supermarket shelf.     HAHHA, It's  LENNON  and Stalin!     LENIN AND MCCARTNEY!!!!     Another Aerosmith sig pic.  HAHAHA, I made one with the headds of the star trek guys too, but I lost it.       My favorite sig pic ever. Toonses found this photo for me and said it reminded her of me, cause my username is "Tyler4President."         BUMPER STICKERS!  The top one was ripped from Bush-Cheney 2000.    Another one of my favorite sig pics.  This is Aerosmith's bass player, Tom Hamilton, dressed up as Martha Stewart.    It's Led Zeppelin!  Just a little sketch, I think I made John Bonham look like Charles manson.      Tyler's (AWFUL) front handspring.  I don't think he's going to have immaculate, Soviet-like technique anytime soon.

      Wow, I'm so proud of my productivity.   I love love love Italian Garlic and Asiago Cheese Bread from the Stop&amp;Shop bakery department, that was my dinner and it was great!! I had pineapple too!! Nothing better than a slab of bread with some pineapple on the side.  So, I was going to write a big rant on my thoughts on marriage, but since I lack mental energy tonight, I will merely discuss my perfect ideal mate. I wonder if he actually exists!!   Here is my ideal husband:       1. He must bathe regularly. Okay, this is really important, because I've dated a lot of tortured artists and tortured guys in bands (I'm a magnet for this sort) and a lot of these guys practiced poor personal hygiene. I have a soft-spot for men with long hair, but you have to WASH IT once in awhile. And change your underwear every day. And wash your clothes regularly. Etc.         2. He must have good manners and the ability to be respectful to others,  especially  my parents. Good manners come naturally when you have respect for others. A lack of manners is generally a symptom of a lack of respect. I don't wish to be with somebody who can't extend basic courteseys to others.         3.He must be ambitious and have a good work ethic, I don't care for slackers, I'm not going to support a guy.        4.He has his own life, his own interests, his own group of friends. He doesn't cling to me or try to keep me all to himself. OMG, I hate it when guys are like "Boo hoo, you don't pay enough attention to me" Maybe if he had a life of his own, it wouldn't bother him so much! I'm not going to be there for a guy 100% of the time, and I don't want a tagalong clone of myself. I want a self-sufficient individual human being who brings his own life and interests to the relationship.        5.He loves animals. The best judge of a man's character is your pet cat!  I can't be with anybody who disses my cats.         6.He's got a great sense of humor and makes me laugh without even trying.         7.He likes to have deep philosophical discussions, but he can do it without being pretensious.       8.He's emotionally stable. No mood swings or flying off the deep end all the time. I prefer to keep stable, level-headed, even-tempered people as my friends.        9.He's not a worshipper at the Shrine of Materialism. He realizes what's important in life, won't go spending all our money on wide-screen televisions, expensive furniture and other uneccessary, useless junk.        10. He's very passionate about his hobbies, interests, career, and life in general. Passionate people are interesting people, and I wish to marry someone interesting who won't completely bore me. Also, people who are passionate about their careers and hobbies and such are far less likely to become clingy and possessive and to try to latch on and suck all the life out of you.            11. We agree upon the definition of the word "fun." In other words, I would not marry a man who thought that hanging around at different bars qualified as "fun." I'd like a guy who'd like to do a lot of the same things I like to do, like go hiking or boating on the weekends. I mean, differing interests are fun, it exposes you to fun pasttimes you might have never known existed, otherwise. Exact clones bore me, but so do people who just want to hit the clubs every night.         12. We agree about basic things like having children and whatnot.         13. and he finds my idiosyncracies endearing rather than annoying    14. We agree on important values. Ideas about morality, what's important in life, etc, etc, and things like that.    You know what they say ususally ends up working out the best is when two people have similar values and come from similar cultural backgrounds, but they have opposite personality types. I don't know, I see that with my parents. My parents are both WASPS, but my mother is so moody and hyperactive and high-strung and cuckoo all the time, wheres my father is an even-keeled vegtable. They get along great most of the time though! Anyhow, that was pointless. So much for my promise to not write stupid, boring blog entries! This is like the fifth completely inane entry in a row.    I want to get to the beach more often for these last couple weeks before school starts! I think I'm going up to the house in Maine for a week, the week after next. I need to stay home next week to watch the Olympics, but next week I think I'll go up to the house in Maine and chill out for a week or two before I go back to school.    I think I'll go to the beach tomorrow, that will be fun!  I have to use these last few weeks of summer up!

      The injuries have already started! Oh, no, I hope there's not many more by next week! I hope none of the Americans get hurt. So far Amy Dodsley, Danielle Kelly, Andreea Munteanu and Lenika de Simone are out with injuries. :( I'm so sad that Munteanu is out! Noooo. I hope nobody else gets hurt between now and next week, this is agonizing. I love the USA training leotards! Very Soviet-chic, don't you agree? [ urlLink  USA training leotards ]  I have to update a few sites and reply to some emails, plus I'm really hungry so I can't think right now, but I'll be back later with a longer entry. A recent discussion at PJB made me think a lot about marriage and stuff like that, so I'll be back with a big long rant. TTYL!

      I saw the Village and it was really interesting.  I don't know how to discuss it without giving away the whole entire plot of the movie, but it was really interesting.  It was really about xenophobia, or whatever - people wanting simplicity and peace and happiness in their lives, separating themselves from the world and finding that passions can flare up and you can't run and hide from pain and misery and such.  I really liked it.  There's a twist at the end that makes you want to re-watch the whole thing from the beginning (much like the Sixth Sense), but I kind of figured out what the twist was going to be as soon as Ivy's father took her into the shed.  It was really good though, I liked it....it wasn't what I thought it was going to be, like from the previews and the first hour of the movie.   There's this lady who posts on the Aerosmith boards, and did you know that her brother was the film editor for the movie?  Her little niece and nephew were even in the wedding scene, but she said they got edited out of it.  I have more photos!!  This is the last of them for a time...    This is Andrew with Abby as a kitten and the late Tommy.  In the living room here in the current house in Connecticut.    Here's me with Andrew, my father and Sam at Mt. Greylock up in Northwestern Mass.  See, my back is to the camera so you can't see the idiotic face that I'm making.  Sam looks little in that photo.  I think I was about to pass out from eating too much candy up there.    There's me and Liz on our graduation day.  I look so stupid!  We're standing in front of Maria Hall. I hadn't slept the night before and we both had terrible hangovers.      Ooooh, there's me when I was like five.  I was so cute!  What HAPPENED?!!?!  I think I'm at Damariscotta Lake in Maine.  That arm belongs to my father.    Here's another of me from ages ago.  Look, Tommy was a tiny kitten in this photo!  I miss him, he was the most irreplacable cat.  The best cat ever, I loved him.  This is the bathroom in Maryland.    This was a dance recital in second grade, I think?  I'm pretty sunburned here.  I was so cute, how did I turn into such a dork?!!?!    What am I doing here?  I'm at Six Flags in New Jersey, I think!  And I'm really cantankerous because of all the lines.  That is my "cantankerous" look, like I'm on the verge of tantruming out.  More later on as I find them and motivate myself to get them onto Freewebs! =)

      To blogging! Right, twice a day two days in a row now.  Well, I'm going to see "The Village" today, and I'll be back tomorrow with a review, if I liked it.   I had some random photos online in my freewebs account that I'd like to post right now!    This is a photo I took of myself because one of my online friends wanted to see a photo of me. I think I'm really tired here, because it was late at night and I'd just gotten in from a night out.  I'm impressed that I was able to focus my camera that well while it was pointed at me!    Here is a photo of myself, my cousin Jimmy and Andrew on the porch in Maryland.  Andrew was going through a chubby phase right then.      Here's a photo of Andrew and myself sitting on the couch in our old house.

      Happy belated birthday to STACY!  I think the two most embarrassing things that ever happened to me in my whole entire life were the following.  1) On the first day of sixth grade, I was at a new school in Maryland. I didn't know where anything was and I was too shy to ask. I had no clue where the girls' bathroom was, so I just decided to wait until I got home to go pee. Unfortunately, by midmorning, I really had to go. By lunchtime, I had to go so bad that I was shaking and I couldn't think of anything else. As I was eating my sandwich, my bladder just let loose and I peed right there in the cafeteria. I got up and ran out with pee streaming, lol. I don't think anybody even saw me or noticed, but it was HORRIBLE! I ran straight to the Nurse's office and I cried. I wanted my mother to come pick me up and let me switch schools or move back to Boston, but she just brought me a fresh change of clothes. Lesson learned: always make sure you know where the bathroom is and use it before you get desperate.  2) In my junior year of college, I was going out with Mike, and Liz and I decided to double-date at Nashoba Valley Ski resort. Liz's boyfriend was really into snowboarding, and Mike already know how to ski so the guys took off and hit the slopes, while Liz and I stayed behind at the lodge and tried to master the bunny slope. So, okay, neither of us had been skiing before and it was all we could do to get from the lodge to the bottom of the bunny slope. We were slipping and sliding every which way, we fell over a few times and couldn't figure out how to get back up. It was funny. Then we had a ski lesson and for the first 15 minutes, it was going okay, but then the ski instructor took us to the top of the slope and I was flying! I couldn't stop, I was out of control. Near the bottom of the hill there was this whole group of people standing around - old people, little kids, etc, OMG. So I'm careening down the hill, and I crash into these people and knock over like four of them. IT WAS THE WORST THING EVER! Liz was laughing hysterically. Lesson learned: Don't ever try to ski again!!!!  The time I humiliated someone else the worst was when....  In church, once, the other first-graders and I made praying hands out of construction paper. We then stood up in front of the congregation and gave a little speech. I forget what we were supposed to say. The other kids started joking around saying things like "These are little hands that you can eat potato chips with!" "Or you can use them to pet your dog!" So I jammed my construction paper hands up one nostril and yelled "OR YOU CAN PICK YOUR NOSE WITH THEM!" My mother died right there and she sent me to my room for two days! Also, I humiliated her the time when I was like, four and we were in the supermarket and some big hairy man passed us in the aisle. I hung out of the cart and said, "Hey, mister, you're pretty ugly!" The guy just glared. My mother said "Oh my god, sir! I am so sorry!" And I said "No way, we ain't sorry!" And stuff....I humilated my mother a lot, I think.  I will humiliate my younger brother quite a bit later today after I scan some old photos =)

      I've been reading a lot of blogs lately, and I've come to an important realization  - PEOPLE ARE BORING!  I used to think that I was the only person in the world who had no life and led a completely dull and monotonous existence, but from reading blogs, it's clear that pretty well everyone on earth is really boring.   Your typical blog entry is like this:  "I hate my job, my job is so stupid, my boss is a jerk!  I love my boyfriend, he sure is great! I love, love, love my boyfriend!  We snuggled some tonight and then we ate some pizza.  I sure do love pizza!  It's great, especially with pepperoni topping!  I should quit my job and work in a pizza restaurant instead, I love it so much!  I got a new shade of nailpolish today, it's pink!  I sure do love nailpolish.  Look, here's some photos of my cat!  Here's a survey, wow, I'm bored."   OMG, SO SEE, there are so many boring people in the world.  It's not just me, it's like everyone.  The whole blog thing is supposed to allow average people to freely exchange great ideas, but most people write about stupid crap in their blogs.  So you know what?  I'm not going to write about stupid crap anymore.  I'm only going to write about my daily life if something out-of-the-ordinary happens or if I feel a legitimate need to truly rant and rave.  Otherwise, I'm going to just write about other things.  My views on life, my political and religious ideologies.  Things like that.  Consider this a miniature editorial column, or something like that.   My day-to-day life will leave you catatonic.

      I'm aiming for 95 theses, right, but as of now all I've got is 43. So it's halfway there! I've decided to keep it here for posterity so I can keep adding to it.  Of course I don't think I need to explain what the 95 Theses are, (unless you slept straight through your high school history classes) but for those of you who need a refresher, during the Reformation, when the Protestant church split away from Catholicism, Martin Luther made a list of 95 things that really ticked him off about the church and went around nailing this list to church doors. I figure that there's a lot of things about modern-day Christianity that tick me off too, and there's sure a lot of things I'd love to nail (or, well, duct-tape) to church doors.  People always accuse me of holding religious beliefs that I don't buy into. Athiests have accused me of being a Bible-beating born-again Jesus freak and Fundamentalists have accused me of being a hellbound devil worshipper because, in fact, my beliefs lie somewhere in the middle. I always feel caught in the middle between the sceptics and the believers. I tell people "I'm not a Christian, I'm an EMILYIST." So these "43 theses" kind of explain what "Emilyism," or my own personal religious views are all about. So from now on, everytime anyone asks me to clarify my views, I'll just refer them to this handy link.  No of course i haven't gotten it all worked out. I'm only 25 years old. Should you have all your ideas about God and the nature of reality and the way the world works figured out by the time you're 25? I don't think so.   urlLink Emily's 43 Theses

      1) Remember my "doelcamylime" livejournal where I wrote endless rants and analyses of Olympic contenders? Yeah, I've thought so long and hard about that that it makes my brain hurt to think about it. I am happy with the team, I understand why Annia is on the team even though I thought Chellsie would be named to the team instead. I've defended this team so much online and offline, I'm sick of explaining to people why this is the best possible team we can be sending. In the end, nothing is for certain, the 6-3-3 format is like sudden death, but this is the team with the best shot at a gold medal. Nobody was "screwed." Hollie Vise, Chellsie Memmel are world champions, sure, but that's what happens with this kind of depth - there's going to be amazing gymnasts who could win Olympic gold medals and they're not going to be on the Olympic team because there are only six positions available. And that's why it's such a huge honor for the six who  do  get chosen. Any way you slice it, some incredibly talented kids are bound to get left off the team, but would it be such an honor if they all got to go to the Olympics? Making the Olympic team is so incredibly meaningful because so few actually do make it.     2) I'm quite sick today, I have a very bad head cold. I was supposed to go to the doctor to find out what's wrong with me today, but he cancelled and I'm going in on the 17th now, so I assume that it's not that serious. I'm designing a logo and website for a local rock band, so I guess I'll stay in and do that today since I'm so incapacitated. I want to go play soccer tonight, but I'm not sure I ought to, being sick and all.  3}  Jamin is sooooo sexy.  He looks like a young Joe Perry, he's great at soccer  and  he and I have long meaningful conversations about why Windows XP sucks as an operating system and why Linux is so much better. Ahhh, it's too bad he's so much shorter than me. I can only seriously date men who are taller than I am. I wish I could feed Jamin magic growth pills or something, and make him six feet tall.  4) I hate having hair. It's too long, too thick and there's too much of it. It gives me a headache unless I put it up, but I think that wearing it in a ponytail constantly is ruining my hairline. I'm getting that Courtney McCool semi-bald look around my hairline, it's bad. I have to find another option, barettes or clips, perhaps?  5) I love Metallica. Eric R. Danton is a moron. Eric R. Danton makes me mad constantly. He hates everyone and everything. He tries to sound all "discerning," but he just comes off like a little negative prick.  6) I should seriously start my own company where I give Aerosmith-stalking tours to Aerosmith fans. My father mentioned that he knew this woman who gives Bruce Springsteen tours in New Jersey, so why can't I do the same in Boston? Think of how many Aerosmith fans would love to see all the sights like 1325 Comm. Ave, the temple that Joe Perry used to work at, or the Orpheum theater. Boston can be a frustrating city to navigate, but I know the city, the streets, the subways and trolleys like the back of my hand. The Full Aerosmith Walking Tour is pretty physically demanding and takes me about 7 hours to complete, so I guess I'd cut it down to areas that are T-accessible. Pretty much everything Aerosmith-related in Boston is on the Green Line because, after all, they are affluent white people. This woman I know online offered to pay me to show her all the Aerosmith sights in Boston....seriously, why not? It would be tons of fun and a bit of extra cash.  7)  Jay Adeff takes beautiful photos.  I want to make some wallpapers from them.  8)  I'm going to eat brownies for dinner!!!!!  I LOVE BEING SICK.  9) I can't wait for school to start back up again. I like to be fawned over by professors and to be told how brilliant I am. I'm not a huge fan of other people, but self-employment really takes you away from the world. I spend so much time alone in my "office" with nobody but my cats to keep me company! Half my friends are all online. I have no life.  10) See, I added links to the sidebar>>>>>>>. I've got some fun sites like the Onion and the Weekly World News and Landover Baptist as well as some serious sites. If you like Russian history as much as I do, visit Marxists.org, it's an AMAZING website, a massive archive of just about every major speech and written document in the history of the Soviet Union. I wish I had a site like that, it's so impressive what they've done.  11) I love to ramble. I'm going to post my 95 theses here soon, like tomorrow, so Julie won't have to read them because she says that my last 5-page dissertation on religion made her climb under her bedcovers and scream! Rambling is so much fun. Seeing as how I can't stay on topic for more than three sentences. I'm the queen of veering off on tangents, aren't I? I think Julie should be happy that she has never talked to me offline, because I talk like I write, cause I talk and write like I think. I can't help it, though.   Wellll that is all. I really want to go play soccer, but I can't hardly breathe, so I might hyperventilate and die in the middle of the field. So I guess I'm going to watch "Tiger Cruise" on Disney, work on this new site, lie in bed and eat my brownies. Signing off.

      Abby  is such a drama queen!   If anyone was legitimately in need of a cat shrink....She makes SUCH an issue of EVERYTHING and she storms around in a constant snit.  "Oh, woe is me!  So full of suffering, this life of misery!."  For example, she's not allowed outside.  The woods behind our house are full of coyotes and birds of prey,  Katie got EATEN one night and Kira died from a bite.  Abby got her ribs broken once, and apparently, she didn't learn anything from it.  It's just too dangerous for cats to be outside at any time.  Abby seriously overestimates her ferocity and her size and she doesn't realize that there are so many bigger, badder predators out in the woods that would see her as snack food. So she mopes about constantly and whines about the injustice of it all.  She sits upstairs on the windowsill like a damsel in distress, locked in her tower, with this look of utter misery on her face.   And then there's the Zorro issue.  She HATES Zorro. She's all like "MY LIFE WAS PERFECT UNTIL THAT LITTLE SNOTFACE CAME ALONG!"  They fight constantly.  Zorro is larger than Abby, but Abby must constantly Dominate everything and she hisses at at Zorro everytime he walks into the room.  There's this cardboard box in the upstairs hallway, and Abby always has to DOMINATE that box.  One night, she found Zorro sitting in her box, and she was completely outraged.  Zorro does have his bratty qualities, but Abby's always outraged and bullshit over something.  And talk about a finicky cat, if you feed her something she doesn't like, she goes through this elaborate routine of scratching at the floor vigorously, turning in every direction.  She doesn't like most things, she only really likes Friskies.  She always has to make a scene.  The slightest thing is cause for massive drama.  The other day Tiffany came over on the back porch and Abby was arched up and growling like "I'm gonna KILL YOU, TIFFANY!!!"  I wonder what she'd say if she could speak English.  I really wish I could get inside her head once in awhile.  Zorro is a cat too, but he has such a great attitude and he's so laid-back.  I'm sure that if they could speak English, they'd both call up and order in seafood and nag us all the time.  If Sammy could speak English, he'd be a grumpy old man.  He'd say things like "YOU CALL THIS TURKEY? YOU GOT THE WRONG BRAND OF SLICED TURKEY! I WANT BOAR'S HEAD HONEY MAPLE TURKEY, NONE OF THIS CHEAP STORE BRAND TURKEY LOAF!"   I'd LOVE to write a novel about all of my pets, they're all such characters.

      And I don't know if I can make it through the next two weeks waiting for the Games to start. It's like waiting for Christmas, combined with the nagging fear that somebody's going to break both her legs before August 15th.  I think that the IOC should consider adding a new Olympic sport, "Rock and Roll Acro." I think that my ultimate USA team would be Steven Tyler circa late 80s-early 90s and David Lee Roth circa the early '80s. And my ultimate British team would be the boys from Westlife. What a showdown that would be! Every time I watch my Aerosmith tapes or see that Van Halen "Jump" video, I always think "You know, this should be an Olympic sport...." I've always wanted to see Tim, Elfi and Al voice-over an Aerosmith concert. "Wow! Great form on that triple-turn-microphone toss, but, oh no! He missed his hand on the crotch-grab, that's going to be a deduction..."  Look, I put up a photo of myself in my profile. It's from a couple years ago, I don't know why I always make moronic faces at the camera. I swear, every photo of me in existence has me making a stupid face at the camera. This was the least-stupid one I could find, and I'm STILL making a face. I'm such a loser.  I seriously want to make a site about Al Trautwig and invite everyone to participate. I was talking to Stacy and Brittany and Rebecca and everyone thinks it's a good idea =) I want to make an online collection of Al Trautwig's greatest quotes from NBC broadcasts; I could even install a PHP script or something to automate it so that people can log in and add their own favorite Al sound bytes.
