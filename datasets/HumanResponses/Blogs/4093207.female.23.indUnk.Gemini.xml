              I remember   when I first met you, I never did pay any much attention to you; I didn’t even utter one word to you. Little did I know that you would play the biggest part in my life; that you would cause so much chaos and disruption in my so called- peaceful love life.

        Just when I thought I was done with love You unexpectedly came into my life Am I a fool who fell hastily in love? Or just a victim of the situation  Confused and hurt Is this how loving you should really feel? Scared and tormented by your deceptions I don’t even know which part of me is real  I gave my love in vain Leaving me all alone With my heart you have broken How was I to know you could hurt me this bad?  All alone in my room Watching the rain falling You don’t even know how lost I am Tired of your lies and deceit  You won’t see me cry in pain Outside the rain will hide the tears Burning me inside out Leaving me deserted and stumped  Didn’t know that there was someone else If I have known I wouldn’t settle for second best My feelings you did hurt But I will cry no more, no -no I’m over and done with you

       I finally set myself free from all the hurt and pain you had brought upon me. It took me a long time to finally realize that I could be a much better person without you.  You only caused me so much pain and suffering by being with you.                     You lead me on to something that wasn’t there.   Bakit? Anong nagawa ko para tratuhin mo ako ng ganun? Akala ko porke’t matanda ka sa akin, eh, mas matured ka kesa sa mga naging kasintahan ko. Pero mali pala ang aking akala.   “Never assume or presume”.   Napakabait ko talaga, kasi kahit na niloloko mo lang ako at pinaglalaruan, iniintindi ko pa rin ang sitwasyon mo. Pilit kong kumawala sa iyo pero, ayaw mo e. Bakit? E wala ka namang naramdaman sa akin noong una pa, how much more ngayon?  Ilang beses na akong nakipaghiwalay sa iyo? Di pa nga tayo nagsasama ng anim na buwan, nang naisipan ko nang kumawala, pero ano? Wala, nagpanic ka at tinanong mo ako kung bakit? At ako naman si tanga, pumayag na subukan uli natin. Ilang beses na nangyari ang ganitong sitwasyon? Dalawa? Tatlong beses na ata.       Kahit anong pilit kong umalis at mawala sa buhay mo, ayaw mo. Bakit? E sya naman ang mahal mo eh? Ikaw na mismo ang nagsabi na sa kanya mo naramdaman ang TUNAY NA PAGIBIG. At kahit sa huling hantungan dalahin mo ang pag-ibig na iyon para sa kanya. At kahit, na pangalawa ka lang sa buhay nya, tatanggapin mo yun, basta makita at makapiling mo lang sya. Sinabi mo rin na kahit na may iba ka na, pag napagisip-isip nya na mahal ka nya ay tatanggapin mo siya uli at iiwanan mo kung sino man ang kasintahan mo. Aba, ayaw kong ako yung babae sa buhay mo na iiwan mo para sa kanya.   Hindi ako ikaw.   Iba tayo ng pananaw at prinsipyo sa buhay, kung ikaw ok sa iyo na maging “second best” sa buhay nya, ako HINDI. Kaya kong mabuhay nang wala ka. Nabuhay ako noon nung wala ka, of course mabubuhay ako ngayon mawawala ka na. Masakit sa una pero alam kong kaya ko ito. Kung nakayanan ko ang mga pangloloko at kasinungalingan mo, malamang mas makakayanan kong tumayo sa sarili kong mga paa pagwala ka na.  Bakit di mo na lang balikan sya tutal sya naman talaga ang mahal mo. Di ba’t ikaw na din ang nagsabi na makakahanap din ako ng taong magmamahal sa akin ng higit pa sa pagmamahal na maibibigay ko sa kanya? Na mas mahihigitan pa nya ang pagtrato nya sa akin kesa sa pagtrato mo sa akin?  Handa na akong iwanan ka; handa na akong mawala ka sa buhay ko. Panay pasakit at sama lang ng loob ang iniwan mo sa akin. Wala na akong pagmamahal na nararamdaman para sa iyo. Pagod na akong magpasensya at umintindi sa iyo. Ngayon, alam ko na kaya kong harapin kung ano mang pagsubok na dadating sa buhay ko. Kaya ko naman talaga iyon, napasandal lang ako sa iyo nang sobra eh.   This time I am learning to breathe….

       Of all the things that happened in my life, meeting you was one of the greatest things that ever happened to me. You gave so much of yourself that I don’t even know why I deserved so much blessing. I thought that you will be my saving grace that I’ve been searching high and low.       Things were great between us, though there were a few bumps here and there, but over-all I can say we had a great time together. You helped me be who I am now and I know you wanted me to be strong and have the confidence that I still need. You made me see that there’s more to life than fairytales and happy endings.    Out of nowhere you started to drift away, not even knowing why things got out of hand. I thought maybe we’ve been spending so much time together that the mystery is no longer there. It was then I decided that maybe we need some space to figure out what we really want. That was when I went away.     Now that I came back, I thought things will be much better; you’ve been paying so much attention to me; the same attention you gave me when we first met. I thought great things are getting better; space was really the only thing we need to rekindle that special closeness we’ve once had. But that didn’t last.    Subsequently you started to drift away, for the second time around. It hurts so much that I don’t even know what I did to make you act that way. I thought it’s just a phase that you’re going through, since I’ve been gone far too long.     Then you drop the news that I never expected from you. I never thought that you’d hurt me this much, and it hurts like hell. You told me you can’t lie to me anymore, that you can’t give me what I deserve. That I deserve a whole lot more than what you’re willing to offer. You’re heart is not there anymore, it wasn’t even there to begin with.     It took me by surprise that I can’t think of any reasons why this is happening to me all over again. I thought that I maybe jinxed and I’d better stay clear from all this serious commitment stuff. And perhaps I just have to let it come to me and not look for it. I care so much about you and God knows how much I try to suppress what I truly feel.    People come and go everyday in our lives. Some for fun, others are for tears. While most simply passes you by. I don’t know where you are, maybe a little bit of everything. Whatever the case may be, you’ve touched my life like nobody has. And fate just has a mean way of teaching me that some good things never last.    Despite of what happened, I can’t find it in my heart to hate you. I’ve learned that you cannot make someone love you all you can do is be someone who can be loved and the rest is upon them. I know time will only tell, of what is in store for me. I know that eventually everything will fall right into place. And if it’s really there, love will show itself truthfully.

       My Immortal Evanescence    I'm so tired of being here    suppressed by all of my childish fears    and if you have to leave    i wish that you would just leave    because your presence still lingers here       and it won't leave me alone    these wounds won't seem to heal   this pain is just too real    there's just too much that time cannot erase       when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears    when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears   and i've held your hand through all of these years    but you still have all of me       you used to captivate me by your resonating light    but now i'm bound by the life you left behind   your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams    your voice it chased away all the sanity in me       these wounds won't seem to heal    this pain is just too real    there's just too much that time cannot erase       when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears   when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears   and i've held your hand through all of these years    but you still have all of me       i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone    and though you're still with me i've been alone all along

       "When we meet the right person to love, When we're at the right place at the right time, that's chance.   When you meet someone you're attracted to, that's not a choice.    That's chance.   Being caught up in a moment (and there are a lot of couples who get together because of this) is not a choice.    That's also a chance.      The difference is what happens afterwards.   When will you take that infatuation, that crush,that mind-blowing attraction to the next level?   That's when all sanity goes back, you sit downand contemplate whether you want to make this into a concrete relationship or just a fling.   If you decide to love a person, even with his faults, that's not a chance.    That's choice.      When you choose to be with a person, no matter what, that’s choice.   Even if you know there are many people out there who are more attractive, smarter, and richer than your mate, and yet, you decide to love your mate just the same, that's choice.      Infatuation, crushes, and attraction come to us by chance. But true love that lasts is truly a choice.    A choice that we make.   Regarding soulmates, there's a beautiful movie quote that I believe is so true about this:    "Fate brings you together, but it's still up to you to make it happen."    I believe that soulmates do exist, that there is truly someone made for you. But it's still up to you to make the choice if you're going to do something about it or not.      We may meet our soulmates by chance, but loving and staying with our soulmate is still a choice we have to make.   We came to the world not by finding someone perfect to love, BUT to learn how to love an imperfect person perfectly. "    ---from the bulletin board from Friendster

       Sweetest Goodbye Maroon 5  Where you are, seems to be as far as an eternity   Out stretched arms, open hearts and    If it never ends, then when do we start?      I'll never leave you behind, or treat you unkind   I know you understand. oh...   And with a tear in my eye give me the sweetest goodbye, that I ever did receive      Pushing forward and arching back   Brings me closer to heart attack   Say good bye and just fly away    When you come back   I have some things to say      How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone when you get home?   Dream away everyday try so hard to disregard    The rhythm of the rain that drops and coincides with the beating of my heart      I'll never leave you behind, or treat you unkind   I know you understand. hey, oh, oh...   and with a tear in my eye, give me the sweetest goodbye    That I ever ever ever did recieve      How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone when you get home?   There must be someplace here that only you and I could go   So I can show you how I feel.      Pushing forward and arching back   Brings me closer to heart attack   Say good bye and just fly away when you come back, I have some things to say      How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone when you get home?    There must be someplace here that only you and I could go   To show you how I feel...feel...feel...feel      -- this song truly depicts my mood... need i say more? *winks at cindy*

        I’ve been searching for so long For a love that’s true Finally found someone Thinking you were the one  But I was wrong You broke my heart in two Told me you never did love me That you love someone else  Why does it hurt so bad? Why can’t I just forget you and go on with my life? I gave you my heart, my all Why does it have to end this way?  Now all that I could feel Are the tears falling down on my face They can’t seem to stop No matter how much I try  Loving you hurts so bad Memories are all that you left behind Missing you more and more each day Knowing that it’s not me you’re longing every night
