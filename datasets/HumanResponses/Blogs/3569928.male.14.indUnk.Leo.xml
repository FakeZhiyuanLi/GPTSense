       we took a day out in bath. but unfortnately i could only skate for 2 hours due to having work that night and the buses stopping early because they are shit. we saw two kids having a fight and one of them pissed on the other kid which was quite funny even though i missed it. tim and adam skated the newish driveway rail and showed evry1 up that was with us.

       We took a trip to NASS this weekend and i have just arrived home. The weekend started off with alex and i arriving at the showground with too much stuff and pointless changes of clothes. We realised we were struggled so phoned james for help. He soon arrived and took our stuff.&nbsp; he went to our camping spot and set up my tent.&nbsp; He is a darling that james. So evrything was sorted for the weekend except for plans. We never had plans so we just monged and whinged and cooked food and listened to tessa ramble on about wiggers and racist terms that she banned from our camp site. There was a lot of whiteys around this weekend a lot of tent trashing. Today(sunday) after james,luke,jared,adam(fukin stoned tried to bash my tent in but forgot his instead),kath and ellie left the rubbish wars started. Everything was throw from sandwiches to metal poles. the smelly campers created a storm of camping shite that flooded eachothers areas. It was great fun untill two people had a punch&nbsp;up which was actually funny except for the guy who started it got a beating haha. Everyone this weekend behaved like fools. Adam thinks i have a grudge or somesort of hatred against him and likes to threaten me. I am not sure why but his antics kept us very amused. Overall the weekend was great and we are all definately going next year.
