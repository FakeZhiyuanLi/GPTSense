       The boys were rained out for all games today and will have to play at least 3 tomorrow, weather permitting. I guess Lyle didn't love us enough to put pictures on the blog so he didn't see that Jackson's toes were supposed to be crossed. That's okay cuz I have Megan's crossed for tomorrow. I just explained that as the next youngest it was her duty. And as soon as Erika gets home and fulfills her motherly duties she could uncross them. On a good note the boys did get to go to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. So that was definitely a plus to not playing. Our house is still in Dodger mourning. We have lost 4 of our favorite household players, Paul Lo Duca (Whose first major league game Adam and I attended), Juan Encarnacion (whose autograph Adam just got last week), Dave Roberts and Guillermo Mota. Although we acquired Brad Penny, Hee Sop Choi and Chuck Finley, our team will never be the same.

      If at first you dont succeed try try again.  I dont know what happened to this post and I cant remember word for word what I wrote, but here is the gist of it.  Adam called and said they walked 4000 miles in the opening ceremonies, he didnt realize that as an athelete you are in the openeing parade not sitting on your bottom watching  it.  He took some pictures, so again I will need that tutorial shortly.  He is worried about not being able to play because of the thunderstorms you midwesterners are allowing to happen, so Jackson has to cross all his toes on one foot for good weather and the ones on the other foot for good games for his favorite boy cousin.  He saw Aaron Carter and was in teenage boy heaven with making fun of him w9ith his friends.  RThe rain started before Little Richard could begin his performance so he missed out on that (he would have liked that one).  No sign of W.  and let's keep it that way!  I just checked Yahoo weather and it is cloudy but 82 in CLeveland, sounds like soup.  hot and humid, eeww!  They havent posted any results.  The last game for today should be over about 6pm Eastern TIme.  On a side note, I think I ruined Adams day yesterday when I told him about the MASSIVE trade the Dodgers made of 3 of his favorite players.  I really dislike Frank  McCourt.

      I just got a call from Adam, they've arrived in Cleveland safe and sound.&nbsp; They are attending ( feasting  is how he put it) a reception for all atheletes before they go to their dorms.&nbsp; Kathy sent her digital camera with him, so sometime between now and Tuesday when he gets home, Erika or Gretchen will have to teach me how to post pictures.&nbsp; If you want to keep track of the games, I think they will be posting scores and info on the website  urlLink http://www.childrens-games.org/ &nbsp; (Erika it made it a link automatically on the PC)&nbsp;

      Well, I didnt get the job.  They "chose" someone whose department is being dissapated.  It really is a let down, this is one I really wanted.  I hate when they interview for show.  I know there are laws and union contracts and you have to interview everyone eligible, but those of us who understand that you would prefer someone or you have to place someone should be told ahead of time so we dont get our hopes up!  AArrgghh!  It is just frustrating.  So my next move is to put my resume out to the real world again.  I hate to leave the district, great beneifts and vacations and all but I also will hate to lose 2 months worth of pay.  On a happy note.  Adam has his reservation for Cleveland, the boys are all flying together on Thursday morning.  After an hour and a half layover in Nashville they should arrive in Cleveland about 9pm.  The opening ceremonies are on Friday with Aaron Carter singing the National Anthem (Megan doesnt understand why Adam isnt thrilled) and President Bush making an appearance.  Truthfully I would feel safer if he just stayed as far away as possible.    Yesterday was pretty uneventful, laundry all day before the cruisers return and take over the machines.  Then practice for Adam.  When we arrived at 5pm someone asked the coach what time to come back and pick up his kid.  The reply was "DARK".  Well at this time of year that can be anywhere from 7:30 - 9:30 so us girls went to the movies.  We picked up Kayla on the way and went to see Cinderella Story.  WHile not a bad movie, it is not something I would have seen if not for Megan (age 12) and Kayla (age 9).  But is was air conditioned (quite cool actually) and dark and quiet so all in all it was very relaxing.

      Today was a busy day.&nbsp; I took Mel, Meg and Adam to Universal Studios.&nbsp; I don't know how much they liked it because the only roller coaster had a 60 minute wait and they chose not to wait that long.&nbsp; I however had fun seeing all the different shows and going on the tram ride through the back lot.&nbsp; At one point near the end of the day Adam is playing a basketball game and Megan says to me can I go over to the water?&nbsp; Sure I reply thinking nothing of it.&nbsp; Next thing I know Megan is soaking wet from running through the squirting water fountains!&nbsp; Of course this was right before we were planning to elave, so not wanting her wet jeans on the seat of my car, we buy her a new outfit to put on.&nbsp; Now, amusement parks don't really sell "outfits" per se but they do sell alot of pajamas and since wearing your pajamas in public is perfectly acceptable in LA thats what she wore.&nbsp;   The kids opted not to have dinner at Hard Rock Cafe at City Walk so we went to BJ's in Burbank and gorged on great food and the most wonderful dessert in the world the pizookie.&nbsp; I can't find a website for them so I will just have to describe it to you.&nbsp; It is a fresh baked huge chocolate chip cookie with a pile of ice cream right in the middle!&nbsp; YUMMY!  Megan turns to Mel as we were leaving and says I don't think I can eat for a week.&nbsp; Well the week is over she promptly came home and had some pudding.&nbsp;   Time for bed for me.&nbsp; Adam has practice with his travelling team tomorrow.&nbsp;

      The interview went well, I think.  The position is in the Public Information office at the District.  They deal with all news media and city and county officials.  When I arrived I was waiting in the foyer when someone rushed out of the Superintendents office needing to retrieve an article from the local paper the Glendale News Press.  Well, I happen to read that paper everyday online so I went onto one of the computers and brought up the site and searched for the article and printed it for him within about 3 minutes.    So that was a good start.  There was 13 questions that I feel I answered well.  I should know the outcome by early next week.

      Wow, I didnt realize how interested everyone was in Adam's baseball career.&nbsp; Ok, I found out about Clevland about a week and a hlaf ago.&nbsp; The city of Glendale is sponsoring a team.&nbsp; I have not heard back yet about the playing time.&nbsp; TOnight we fill out information and find out about flight information.&nbsp;   As for the link, you can only make it a link on a PC.&nbsp; All this really cool stuff like font and everything is not available on a MAC, which is what I have at work.

      Oh well, we blew their streak.  We had great seats for last nights game.  Field level righ behind 3rd base.  Adam got 4 autographs and before the game and came up to the seats with the biggest grin saying we can leave now.  Well we should have.  ALthough we rallied in the 9th it wasn't quite enough.    Jackson would have a very cute new Dodger outfit if his cousin Melody wasn't so mean.  Just because Erika once stated he doesn't need anymore clothes she believed her.  Oh well there will be other games without her around and we will spoil him then.  Adam and I have a big meeting tonight, he is going to Clevland next week to play in an International Children's Games thingy  http://www.childrens-games.org  All we pay for is the airfare.  The kids stay in dorms and play against other kids from around the world.  So if anyone will be in or around Clevland next week go see my boy play.  I am a little nervous about sending him alone but  he will be with friends.

      Last night was my first night home without any baseball.  So of course we vegged out in front of the TV.     I just can't get enough reality shows.  I guess my life is so mundane I must live vicariously through others!  I watched the first episode of the new Trading Spouses last night.  If you get a chance to see arepet of this it is hilarious.  Two women from completely different backgrounds change places for a few days with a payoff of $50,000 at the end.  There are a few catches of course but the two that traded this time is like Florida from Good Times and someone from Dynasty.    Of course Big Brother is my all time favorite.  If you haven;t watched your tape yet, you should move away from this blog.  I can't believe eraser head took off Paris Hilton!  It is fun to watch with us at home as we rename everyone on the show.  Nakomis/Nebraska/Nickle  what the heck is her real name anyways?    Amazing Race is awesome once again , but why does it have to be on so late?!?!?!  Shmirna and Mirna provide plenty of comic relief throughout the show.

      I have an interview on Thursday for Administrative Secretary Confidential in the Public Information office at the District.  For those of you that aren't aware, I am looking for a new job because the school I am at will no longer be yera round as of the 2005-2006 school year, which means I will not be a 12 month empoyee.  I will have 8 weeks off in the summer UNPAID!  My last resort is to get a new job outside of the district.  I have my transfer papers in to try for any open 12 month 8 hour positions.  So keep your fingers crossed for me.

      Oh well, our Junior boys all stars put up a great fight but lost their second game in a double elimination round last night.  The only good news is I don't have to drive to Palmdale through the fire storm anymore.  I think I got the smell of smoke out of my car.

      Okay I might as well jump on the band wagon.  If I get realy good at this I can put pictures up as well.  And although my children are cute, they are not nearly as cute as Jackson.

I tried to write them to a cd for Gretchen but of course there is something wrong with my writer. I will try to get one done before Melody goes back there for a visit.

      We rolled into the house (a wonderfully clean house, thank you Ris) about midnight last night.  Just got up watched a little world series action (mom are you watching this year?).  Going to Costco and then will post tonight or tomorrow (I have taken the rest of the week off of work to recover from this weekend) with a try at posting pictures.

      I don't know how many of you have tried to pump information out of an exhausted 14 year old boy before, but it aint easy.  The team walked off the bus looking like zombies, they had not slept the night before, too much adrenaline I am sure.  On our drive home to his bed, I got a call from a co-worker offering me free Dodger tickets and parking, as I was going to decline because of exhaustion this person ion the back seat woke right up and insisted that we go pick up Melody and go.  Good thing we did because parking was right next to the entrance.  Our seats were irectly behind home plate, and the DOdgers played a great game.  So throughout the night he spit and spouted tiny bits of information about the trip.  I will post those when I am home at a PC and can do so with formatting.

      Due to a glitch in my ability to not only remember to set up a VCR but to also explain to someone over the phone how to do it, we missed all 3 shows last night.  SO be fruitful in your comments so we can enjoy through you.

Adam called me a little while ago and let me know they went undefeated and will receive the Gold medal at the closing ceremonies tonight.  I have just landed back on Earth (but have yet to stop crying) so it took me some time to get this post up.  Erika very nicely sent me training on pictures so as soon as I get some they will be up.

      http://www.childrens-games.org/results_frame.html?event=baseball_boys.html  You can go to the website and get updates on the games.  We found out last night that the team was supposed to be on Good Morning America today but I have not been able to watch it here at work.    But I have set it up to tape at home.  As soon as Adam calls me I will update everyone.

      The boys got to play today and play they did.  They beat the S. Korea team 18 to 0.  ANd also beat the Newar NJ team (I don't know the score.)  So they are at this time the #1 seed.  According to Adam they are guaranteed the Bronze, if they win one game tomorrow they will get Silver and if they win both games tomorrow they get Gold.  So all in all a very good time is being had.  The Rock N ROll Hall of Fame was a bust even the old guy (coach Steve my age) said it wasnt worth the time or admission price of $20.
