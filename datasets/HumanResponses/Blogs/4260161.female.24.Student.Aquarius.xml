       Procrastination is my middle name. It never fails that whenever possible, I will procrastinate until the absolute possible last minute. That explains why I haven't done my assignments even though school starts in 4 days. Nice, huh?       My mom consistently warned me that it was a bad habit. A very bad trend to start in elementary school that would certainly catch up with me in middle school. Well, it continuted in middle school and the warnings increased: 'this has to stop before high school.' You cannot start writing a paper the night before it's due. Yet the whole time I was bringing in A's she couldn't complain tooooo much. "It will definitely ruin you in college. College kids don't do that." Personally, I don't think it was the proscratination that caused my A average to drop. I think it was the FUN. and the beer. But anyway, I still procrastinate because I work better under pressure. It's hard for me to concentrate on something that isn't due for another week. If I read it now, by next Thursday I'll have forgotten the details.    My little sister is currently at day #1 of orientation at another law school in the south. Hers is ranked higher than mine, if you're wondering. But I had more fun in college. Her graduation present consisted of all my first year supplemental materials wrapped up in pretty pink paper. She was impressed by the number of presents until she started opening them. haha.

       I wonder if politics ever play a role in Olympic judging?  That may be cynical, but the thought crossed my mind.

       I discovered blogs recently, and I'm hooked. I came across one while trying to look something up about lawschool. And that one was linked to another, which linked to another and so on. It's an entire community of law school blogs. So then I tried to find a blog written by a prosecutor or an assitant DA because that's what I'm interested in. I found numerous blogs by defense attorneys and public defenders. But no prosecutors. I probably didn't look hard enough - or not in the right places. So I decided to just start my own.  I'm fascinated with criminal law. Not the fictional t.v. shows like CSI but stuff like Court TV and documentaries on A&amp;E and Discovery. The   urlLink  Innocence Project    facinates me. What sparked my interest in criminal law? Watching   urlLink  The Fugitive    with my parents and later learning it was a true story. The details are mind-boggling.  So, anyway, I decided I'd start writing about my experience in law school. I'm a rising 2L and classes start next Monday. I bought my books yesterday. Just under $700. ouch. That doesn't include supplemental materials.  Last thing: I highly recommend summer school. I think the professors are in a better frame of mind (even though I hear they get paid less for summer classes). And I think they curve higher.
