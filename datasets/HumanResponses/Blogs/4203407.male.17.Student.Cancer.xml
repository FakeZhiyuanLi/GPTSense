      I couldn't think of a better title. Things are going pretty tickety-boo at the moment. I mean, the '2' on my mobile phone broke, and my courtesy mobile has been blacklisted; BT has been really out of sorts, possibly because he has a hairball lodged in his throat; and Ed's away, but I'm feeling rather emotionally sprightly. I've been tidying my room up a bit, coming up with big plans for OddBlog.  I had some weird dreams this morning, but I can't think what they are. Some probably had to do with next year and what it'll be like. Actually, the night before last I got into two massive MSN convos - you know the ones, where some bone-head (usually Ben) invites hoardes of peeps who you don't know for some kind of nerdy kick. In the second one I met a couple of gays from the West Country/Wales, so I kind of got into that mood - with people from school like Ben and Dave still in the convo. I think next year I'm definitely going to be outed.

       Although it was more a kind of fantasy, as I was awake at the time. Basically, the year had been taken to some kind of creepy mansion for no discernable reason (some kind of field trip). The teachers were totally scared of the monstrously lurchsome inhabitants of the mansion, but who they nonetheless had to comply to. They were eerie. Anyway, we all had our dorms, which were admittedly large, but for some reason we all just accepted (though disliked) these Lurchers kept wanting to inspect them, during which time all four inhabitants would line up with military sharpness while they came in.  Anyway, one time Alex invited me up to the top floor, but instead of going to see him, I got into Nick's room. The arrangement of people in there was weird: on my right was Stuart Watson, with massive hair. To the left was that guy from 6th form. I presume he was joining us on our field trip as a kind of peer envigilator, but I never questioned this in the dream. Nick was to the forward right, and Al Glaister was to the forward left, though he was absent from the room. Nick got me playing some kind of weird interactive video game, which I shall now proceed to fail to explain...  There was a large screen on which a weird bulldozer vehicle (one of the semi-devilicious ones you might see in The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror short 'Homega') with various traditional monster on board who had a kind of water pistol, which was what I 'fired' at. They also threw kinds of flamanges at me, which actually fell down on me in my chair, which was supposed to be my car. One of them was going to hit 'the car', so I held out my hand and knocked it to my left. There then followed a long arguement. Apparently, because it had "hit the wall of a Stannah stairlift" I had lost the point. Pointing out that there was neither a Stannah stairlift nor a wall there was pointless: there was one underneath the floor. Pointing out that carpet, floorboards and the ceiling separated the flamange from the wall of doom was also pointless. Then we decided to play another game, one in which Stuart and 6th form guy joined it. I can't remember how it went. I think 6th form guy was playing the part of an alien, and my part, when I asked, was irrelevent, other than that I had to follow the rules. They completely went over my head, but fortunately we were interrupted.  Unfortunately it was the lurching master manequins of the place. While the inspection was carried out, I was stuffed into the space behind the drawers in a bedside cabinet (Stuart's) where, to my shock, there was a naked person also hiding (it didn't occur to me to question why at the time - I was half asleep!). I did ask him why he hasn't escaped earlier, and he said that the Lurchers keep constant surveillance of the dorms beginning with an inspection, and going on for an indeterminate length, so if I myself were to leave the hiding spot immediately after the inspectors had gone, I'd be picked up on camera. Yeah, not so much logic, but then these big guys were freaky - there was definitely something spooky going on in this place. Needless to say I got caught.  I was dragged by two large brutes down the hall, but I was reaching out for Nick. I got dragged past my own dorm and somehow managed to bash open the doors and call out to him for help and stuff, but of course everyone was pretty dazed by it, and no doubt intimidated by the monstrous hulks. I broke into the next room along, too, which was Ed's, and somehow managed to stumble into it despite the two large beasts trying to hold me back. More of them were drafted in. (pause in typing while I'm invited into a mass convo.) So now I'm just getting desperate, and my desire not to get dragged away is just giving me superhuman strength. And more drones are pulling at me, until they stretch out the door (big rooms remember, and I'm reaching for Ed on the other side of it). They've lifted all my limbs off the ground, but they still can't pull me back.  Eventually someone decides to start a fight with these bozos, and everyone joins in, but eventually I get dragged away and taken down to the cellar. And that's basically as far as the dream went. Mum kept phoning me, since I've had to send my phone in for repairs (a broken 2 button) and my temporary replacement is actually blacklisted and won't connect to the Orange network, so I had to get up. It actually sounded like a decent premise for a film, but then this is coming from a guy who thought he could turn his life into a series of dramatic TV episodes.  Bah, another mass convo. I may have outed myself. I'll get back to you.

      Oh God... I was just browsing a TS2 Forum, and the question of 'How much Insomnia have you clocked' came up, insomnia being how long after midnight you've played for. One person has played from midnight and beyond for 3 days. 3 days! I then go on to read about even more people who say they would spend all their time in exactly the same way, and that they love using the Forums, etc., etc.  Omigod!  That is so sad. I don't want to be like that. I want to go out and have fun. I want to read and watch movies and listen to and create music and draw, all with artistic thoughts running through my head. I want to finish TOE, I want to play in a band, I want to experience a wide and rich variety of forms and styles of entertainment. I want to swim and play some kind of sport regularly.  Gawd, now I'm all depressed about how my life is panning out. The summer holidays suck. Owww, my belly hurts. X-(

      Yeah, what with uJournal having packed in, I thought I'd take the initiative and switch over to Blogger. I've been using it to host my Oddworld news blog for some time now, as uJournal was insufficient for what I wanted to do with that. However, uJournal continued to suit me for my Quotidienne... Until now. Not that I'm upset with the people behind uJournal. They've offered a fantastic service for me over the months... in fact, over the years.  I won't bother uploading anything from my uJournal to here, as I painstakingly did with OddBlog. For one thing, my last few updates probably won't have survived, though I'm confident the most of them will have. Now... I have about a week's worth of events to detail to you.  :-p  Tuesday was, of course, the day I went into the city to meet Jonny. That didn't go as well as planned. I had planned to take Jonny to a cafe or something afterwards, buy him a drink, and have a really good chat with him, which I'd actually come up with quite spontaneously with Nathan the night before, after ages of agonising over it. However, as it happened, Jonny had to leave by 4, and even then overstayed by 20 minutes because of all the trailers and adverts they show. King Arthur was a good film, though. I was amused when Jonny leant over to me and pointed out that "there are no mountains there." Funny, I always though the area north of Hadrian's Wall was somewhat mountainous, it being Scotland and all. I was also amused by Swordy's random showing up. He just plonked himself next to me, much to Jonny's delight and my exasperation. He asked me if he should leave, but I told him not to. I couldn't tell Jonny anyway.  I now believe I'm actually over him.  Thursday saw me in the city with Nick. We met up in Ster and went and saw The Stepford Wives, which was much better than I expected. In fact, I most enjoyed it. Afterwards, Nick and I enjoyed a stroll and a chat before we headed back towards Nando's and lunch. I was a bit disappointed by not getting a tub of their great mayonnaise as I did last time I was there with Ed (I detest most mayonnaise, but Nando's is brilliant and I love it), and also they had changed the menus to get rid most of the fun, lively remarks such as "Enjoy passionate debates," and so on. Afterwards, Nick didn't have much time til' his bus arrived, so we walked over to the Castle Gardens, with me complaining about all the muffies that would be there. I told Nick to guess. Finally I told him, bwahaha.  I spent much of Saturday working, which threw Ed's and my plan to meet up sometime before he left on holiday into a somewhat last minute caper. Ed was meeting with someone he has, ahem, taken a liking to on either Sunday or Monday, though this was conveniently cemented to Monday, meaning I could enjoy Sunday afternoon with Ed. As it happened, 'enjoy' was a somewhat laughable term. We met, Ed being much impressed by my new look (so he tells me, at least :-p), and went upstairs to chat to Al and persuade him to give us free tickets. After that, we ate at Nando's (of all places!) where our chicken breast burgers were decorated with Fast-Food-style plastic cheese, which fortunately was alright. 20 minutes later, and we walked out of what I can safely say is the shittiest film I have ever seen. Don't see Thunderbirds. It's shit - and I enjoyed Lost In Space, so take heed of my words. The Thunderizer... Uck. The last straw was "Time to Thunderize."  Tragically, since Ed was now free, it meant he had to take his sister swimming, so once again my outing with someone was cut short (gee, three in a row, what a fab week). We quickly ran off to Nando's because I'd left my sunglasses there (clever!), then were much amused by there being no bus for Ed to get home on, on a Sunday. Although there was really, it was just not going to the nearest stop, so I did really have to be abandoned again. Still, we had a great chat in the intervening half an hour, and I finally realised that Norwich is dull and there is remarkably little to actually do.  I guess I can breeze over the last couple of days, as all they have involved is personal downstairs problems and me teasing Peter over the webcam. Dad has gone to London, so while Mum is at work, I'm free to clothe myself however - or however much - I want.  ;-)  On Monday I did phone Ed in the evening to ask how things had gone that day for him, but he was busy at the time, and said he'd phone me the next evening, which went without call. I got home from Granddad's this evening, and made sure to do a 1471 - only for Ed's number to be read out. Hahaha, what bad luck. I speculate that Nathan is a good friend and told Ed how *devestated* I was that he didn't call me back. And now Ed's on holiday, tsk.  Still, Meyer has just this very evening invited me to his birthday city adventures. Current plans, as far as I am aware, involve eating at Pizza Express and seeing The Bourne Supremacy (and not Aliens Vs. Predator, because despite Will's claim, that doesn't come out here for another two-and-a-half months, hahaha). Nathan is even coming, and I've been trying to drag him outside all holidays. I guess he'll only comply to the posse spirit. *sigh*  Well, here's to tomorrow, and all the nothingness it will bring.
