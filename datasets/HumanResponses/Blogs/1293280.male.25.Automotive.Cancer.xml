        Bombs Away  My application to the University of Denver thing is now on its way to the land of rich white folk. Ain't no one who can stop me now! Except for the people controlling the application process.  An aside: I went to go and beg my High School newspaper advisor for a letter of recomendation. Par for the course, the people you haven't seen for years always remember your worst qualities. (i.e. "You could never make a deadline! I hate you!" I made the second part up, but it was in the subtext of what she said.)  While waiting to talk to her, one of her students approached me: "So, who ARE you anyways?" Me: "I'm one of her students from way back..." Kid: "So has the publications room changed alot since you were here?" Me: "Yeah, you could say that. We used to be in another room, I graduated in '97." Kid: "Woah, that IS way back." Me: "Shut up, kid."  That last part I made up. In reality, I got on my motorized scooter and sped off into the sunset looking for prunes.

        Ideas I wish I'd thought of... (Part 1)  Title: Quarterback Justice Squad  The Premise: Joe Nameth and John Elway travel across the universe righting wrongs as they ride the Two Horses of The White Porsche. They are The Quarterback Justice Squad.  Credit where it's due: This idea sprung forth from the fevered mind of Kurt Card sometime after his meds wore off. Now if I can just convince Nameth and Elway to sign off on this I'll be a rich man.

        Time to pack my oxygen tank, I may be going to Denver...  Yes that's right. Denver. No, I didn't win a contest. Tomorrow, I send in my application for The University of Denver's  publishing institute. They only accept about 96 people, so why not throw my hat into the ring?  One of the boring goals of the seminar ( I assume that most of you have stopped reading by now) is job placement. The success rate is pretty decent, from "Send my things!" to "You start in a month...if you don't piss us off." So maybe I won't use my BA to work at the mall for the rest of my life. Who knew?  I'll know by Tax Day. So cross your fingers or whatever you got and maybe this July I'll get to do my best Dennis Hopper imatation. Don't get it? Rent   Blue Velvet.  ... and watch it with your mom. (Misleading people is funny.)

        I think it's over...  Well it's been almost a full week, but I think I'm free of that damn cold. This thing just would not die.

        "Well, everyone IS talking about it."                                    OR "I've got a bad feeling about this."  I had decided to do my best to stay away from current events but a low-flying plane from the local Air Force base put things in perspective for me.  Within the course of a day things have gone from bad to sweet-fuck-all in regards to world events. If history is recorded properly, this could go down as one of the most opposed wars ever. And as Americans it seems that all we can do is shake our heads and frown disapprovingly.  I have lost a lot of faith recently. I fear that the system no longer works and the people are left with out a choice. We can picket and protest as much as we want, but no one is listening anymore. We have not yet lost out voice so I have yet to lose all my faith.  The correct term for what is going on right now is "War by Sleight of Hand." Look close at the last two years, The War on TERROR wasn't going so hot...The most powerful country in the world can't seem to catch ONE MAN and attention is redirected. Iraq becomes a problem again and we jump right into North Korea's business as well.  Which cup is the ball under? How many more embarassing failures can we execute before G.W.B's term is up?  And somewhere, deep in the heart of Texas, G.W.B. Sr. screams, "AVENGE ME!"  And like a good son, Jr. says, "Okay..."

        Down with the sickness  I seem to have picked up some sort of virus on St. Patricks Day. Cleverly disguised as the common cold I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I'm dead. At least that's how I feel.  I think I'm going to go drink a bottle of Nyquil. See you in a month...

        Amos 'n' Apathy  Recently, why not more than an hour ago, it was brought to my attention that I appear to care about very little. Admittedly, I keep my cards close to my vest. But as one who would fancy himself some kind of writer, I'd like to think I have a vast myriad of emotions.  And as a guy I know that I should only feel: Hot, cold, sleepy, angry and happy. (Don't let that last one get out)  So, as the Budhists would do, I must find the balance. The first question I ask myself is: "How does this affect me?" At the end of the day I don't really give a shit what Avril Lavigne does, she'll be gone soon enough.  The people in my life, there's the rub. It's the direct interaction between me and all of you that makes me who I am. And while I don't always seem 'all there,' the gears are turning. The human condition, I could write a book...maybe.

         12 Angry Men  Like most people who can't afford a decent computer or ISP I am on AOL. The "Us Weekly" of the web, filled with meaningless factoids, graphs and pretty, pretty photos. One such waste of time I happened upon was "Celeb look-a-likes."  A dozen random people with their pictures placed next to a famous person they vaguely resemble. And that 'vague' with a capital 'V.' And, oh yes, it gets better. From "#1 Pam Anderson is a woman. You are not." to "#12 What's Pam Anderson doing with that dirt-pig?"  None of these people ranked above a five on average.  Now maybe it's because of people who go through and give everyone a '1.' Or maybe we place too much emphasis on celebrity.  Honestly, giving people a '1' to drag the average down. Just when I thought I had lost all faith in humankind....  And for the record... I look like MTV newsman Gideon Yeago I date Julianne Moore. And I once knew Courtney Love and Fred Durst.

        Wait...What?  So this question was posed to me recently: "You're paying five bucks a month for a website that no one is going to look at?" "Yeah," I responded, "that's about the long and the short of it."  So, why am I doing this?  Because I'm an American! That's why. And as an American I feel it necessary to shoot my mouth off at every little thing. Even if I'm right or not (My track record usually leans toward the latter). When did this country start going to hell? And if you're saying when Bush was elected, that's too recent.

        The Future Is Now  Holy crap, the ammount of trouble I had to put my personal tech support through to get a picture of an old man flipping the bird was just unreal. So the short answer to the question that nobody asked is: "It's magic."  Well the plus side to this inane little venture is that I got a couple of emails out of people I haven't heard from in ages. What's that? 'I could write them?' Well, I'll have you know that I'm a busy man... That's right. Those Star Wars dvds aren't going to watch themselves. And I'm sure my job would just fall apart if I didn't show up...  So, in summation, write me an e-mail. And would it kill you to call your mother?

        Booze Fueled Mayhem! ... Or not. Ventured out to the edge of creation tonight (Oxford. Trust me, it's way the hell out). I was reminded of the 3 qualities of things: Good, bad and free. While I don't normally drink whiskey sours, it was free... So why not?  In news that doesn't relate to my drinking problem: I had the day off. So I covered alot of ground. Most of Southeast Michigan in fact. Detroit, Dearborn, Novi and Oxford. With the way gas is priced now I must be out of my mind.

        More Wrong Ideas  I've decided that my comic book will center around the misadventures of Bob The Big Ol' Baby. (Get it? B.O.B.? Yes? No.) Anyways, there seems to be a new breed of 'super-baby' being produced today, many of which will out weigh me by their third birthday.  I don't know how any of this is possible, seeing as the baby's mommas claim only feed them five grapes for breakfast, lunch and a sensible dinner. Regardless, Bob will go on many zany adventures upending cars, breathing heavy and teaching us all to love again.

        This is for my homies in lock-down...  Shout out to my dawgs in the corporate sector! Keep reading this crap an I'll keep writing it.  Anyways, I made a trip to the ol' Barnes & Noble last night and was unable to walk away without purchasing something. For all the 20-something out there (and whoever else reads this): Go purchase 'Box office poison' by Alex Robinson. Be warned. It is a graphic novel (10 cent word for comic book).  It's a nice slice of life style comic for the post college set. It's well written and covers everything about being young: Relationships, shitty jobs, fears about the future and so on.  While I'm at it... Read 'King Ink' by Nick Cave (Same guy that fronts the Bad Seeds). It's poetry that'll make you squirm in your seat. 'Elephant' from the White Stripes is a good listen too. Mort Crim in the house.

        Ideas I Wish I'd Thought of Part 1.5  I just got the memo, The Q.B. Justice Squad is now the Intergalactic Quaterback Justice Squad. Kurt Card is the Captain, we're all getting Dragon skin boots from Macy's and will travel the universe righting wrongs. Then Kurt shot me with a bb gun. Then I shot Dave, he shot Dylan and then it was my turn again.  Booze and boredom DO mix. They mix well.

        "Hey neighbors. How y'all doin'?"  Saw the White Stripes last week. Here's the breakdown: Before the show even started the "Drunkest Man in the Universe" sat behind us. He kept quoting lines from the song "Little Acorns" and reeking of J. D. The first opening act, The Go, were alot like The Black Crows. That'd be nice if I thought the Black Crows were cool. The second act took the sucky cake. If you ever hear of a band called Whirlwind Heat...go the other way, plug your ears or slit your throat. I've been instructed to use the word 'Tourettes' to describe the lead singer. Done and done. But here's my take: If James Brown was a 13 year-old white kid with C.P. and fronted a band that consisted of drums, bass and a Moog synth. That's what this band was.  Anyways, The White Stripes put on a great show and made up for all the drunk guys and shitty bands.

        ...Now give me back those five weeks of my life  After weeks and weeks of waiting I received word from the Denver Publishing Institute yesterday. And it went a litte something like this:  "Dear Eric, Thank you for you interest in the Univ. of Denver's Publishing Institute. While your application was a strong one, we'd like you to know that we hate you and have a personal vendetta against you. Yes, you.  Your name has been placed on our waiting list of other people with "strong" applications. A space may become available. But don't hold your breath.  Don't call us,  The P.I. staff"  It was by far the most sugar coated rejection letter I have ever had the pleasure to read. They've even fooled me into waiting for them to call. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to sit by the phone.

        ...Now give me back those five years of my life  Well, after months and months of waiting I just now got my degree in the mail. Graduated on December 12th and the degree was supposed to be mailed within 10 weeks. Four months later...WSU is clearly a model of efficiency.  At least they spelled my name right. Now back to the business of getting on with my life.

        God Hates Michigan  Yes, it's true. Within last 5 days or so the weather has gone from the promise of spring straight back to the hell-frozen-over landscape of winter. And it's April. For those of you lucky enough to live outside of MI, this wasn't a 'mild dusting' of snow either. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a sizeable dent in the squirrel and hobo population.  Thousands of people without power. Car accidents out the yin-yang. It's the end times.  Next chance I get, I'm out of this state.

        "The Velveteen Touch of a Dandy Fop"  So... Nothing better to do than watch "I love the 80s" on VH1. I can barely pull myself away from the TV to the computer. Anyways, after that decade I'm surprised I turned out the way I did.  1984: He-Man and "Purple Rain" kind of a mixed bag of sexuality. Throw Madonna in the mix and you've got a genereation of confused kids. Thank Jeebus for Transformers. 1988: Wow I hate "Rosanne."  That show was NEVER EVER funny. It was about as funny as "The Cosby Show." Don't get me wrong, Cosby's stand-up kills me every time... But Rudy and Theo learning life lessons and teaching us how to love again. Fuck off. Still we got the Ed Lover dance. And Jeff Kuhnie will never let you forget that.  But goddamn if Punky Brewster didn't grow up hot.  More on the 80s later. Because they say 'Write what you know' and the 80s are such a fertile breeding ground for I don't know what.

        This just in...  Contract negotiations with the spider monkey set to take over the role of Eric Henson have fallen through.  When reached for comment the spider monkey's agent said, "Due to prior commitments Mr. Monkey has opted to pass on the prize role of Eric Henson. Please look for his new project, a weekly television adaptation of the film "Outbreak," in the fall of '03."  It is rumored that Henson's people (?) are looking to fill the role with Henson's very own resurrected zombie corpse. Johnny Depp has signed of to voice the zombie and Tim Burton is set to direct.  Said Burton of the project, "It will be better than 'Planet of the Apes' but not as good as 'Frankenweenie.' Kind of like 'Nightmare Before Christmas' if I had directed it.

        Eric Henson, Dead at 23  An industrial accident, that is already being called "shocking" and "mildly erotic," has claimed the life of promising young layabout and troubadour Eric Henson.  He leaves behind no will and no heir to claim his empire of crap.  The role of Eric Henson will now be played by a spider monkey.

        Buy This Book Part II  In my quest to keep myself entertained at work I often stumble upon things that are too good to keep to myself. "A Year At The Movies" by Kevin Murphy is my most recent find. Murphy, better known as Tom Servo from MST3K, has set out to see one movie a day (in a theater or public venue) for an entire year.  Now I know that this may seem like a dusty book on film criticism... but it ain't. The tag-line for the book is "One Man's Filmgoing Odyssey and it is indeed that. Murphy is truly in love with the movie going expierence and it shows.   If you hate multiplexes or Hollywood crap (cough*Matrix*cough) this is a book you should read.  Next in Eric's Book Club is "Mike Nelson's Death Rat!" We'll see how that one goes.  In other crap related news: I read that The Matrix isn't doing as well as the suits had hoped. Boo-hoo. If you have the time hop on over to aintitcoolnews.com and read the review posted there.  Harry Knowles (who I think wrote the review) writes in circles trying to justify to himself that it was a good movie. The review is typically long-winded and his complaints are backed up by lame praise in an attempt to cancel them out. It's like five years ago when I was trying to stick up for The Phantom Menace.  "Well...The lightsaber duel at the end made it all worth while!"  What can I say some folks just like stupid movies.

        I've come back to tell you about... THE WORST MOVIE...EVER!  Okay, I've been a bit busy as of late so let's get to it. Before I begin a short quote from Mike Nelson's book 'Movie Megacheese.' If you don't have it, buy it.  "We live in a world that has laid untold riches at the feet of Keanu Reeves as reward for his ability to say the word 'whoa.'"  Now onto the good stuff.  The Matrix Reloaded is not simply the worst movie ever. It is the worst THING ever. Never before have I encountered a movie with such obvious contempt for its audience. You hate the movie and it hates you right back.  It's a little known fact that if all the slow-motion in the Matrix was shown at regular speed the movie is cut down from a robust 138 min. to a  mere 27 min. 38 sec. Seriously, the movie starts with a slo-mo motorcycle crash jumps to a slo-mo back-flip and meanders into a(nother) slo-mo fall out a window, guns-a-blazin'.  But it was all a dream.  At this point the movie begins an hour of long and pointless expostion. They return to a place that's not the Matrix and is populated buy hippies and their drum circles. Vague references are made to a nebulous back story not covered by the first movie. They can be filled in by cartoons and video games and if you haven't bought them now... you're less of a person.   So after the explanation of nothing (everyone speaks in euphemisms or riddles) they go back to the Matrix to look for...stuff. But not before an artfully shot hippie party/love scene. So, let me get this straight, evil machines have banished humanity from the face of the planet and the 'rave' culture survives? Great. I hope I was one of the first killed when they took over.  In the Matrix more vague statements are made and slo-mo fight scenes are had. Every frame of which is slowed down, showing the violence in a new and (almost) pornographic light. Don't get me wrong. I love violence and I love pornography, but in the case of the Matrix it's a long way from chocolate in peanut butter.  The special effects in this movie caused me to look a bit more closely at the term. When they say special they mean "special." As in "Missing a chromosome or three." One of the things I like about the medium of film is the suspension of disbelief aspect. When somebody is replaced with a 'digital double' you know. The computer's movements seem even more blocky and wooden than those of the real actors.  Which brings me to the stars of the movie. All actors involved were more than likely shot-up with barbiturates or reading thier lines from cue cards held off camera. People (well, alright, me) say jokingly that they've seen better acting in porno movies. For once it's REALLY TRUE. No person in this movie ever really emotes or gives the sense that what they are doing (saving the world?) really matters. Love relationships between characters seem strange and cold, people are introduced in one scene as being important and are never seen again in the movie. The main character actually disappears for 14 min. leaving all the others to fend for themselves. They even manage to introduce a character at the very end of the third act who has never been mentioned, or even alluded to, in the movie.  Being part two of a three part trilogy was rough on this movie and the viewers. At the end of the first Matrix all is tied up. Neo is "The One" and about to board the Pain Train set for all points in the Matrix. All's well that ends well, right? $$$ not exactly. Neo's role in this movie is much less than the all-powerful One we were lead to believe. He's more of the One-half. He can get into long fight sequences but can't determine if he really has free will or is pre-destined to do everything he's doing.  Everything about this movie was bad. The acting was sub-standard, the fight scenes were boring and uninspiried and the cliff-hanger ending was worse than most soap operas. I really expected to hear "Bum-bum-BUMMM!!!" at the end. Then the trailer for M3 takes what little wind the ending has (He makes it out of the coma!).  So why go see a bad movie? I saw the first one in the theater, was sucked in by the spectacle of it all and gave it an unsure thumbs-up. I rented it, watched it alone and only then did I realize what a bad movie it was. Of course maybe I'm just doing this to be contrary, but I really think this movie sucked. For once, words fail me. I knew it was going to be bad, but I tried and tried to view it objectivly and still I was left loathing the movie.  I hate, hate, HATE this movie. I can't wait to see how god-awful the next one is. From here on out it's all just morbid curiosity.

        Oh, the waiting...  So right now (yes, this takes place in real-time) I'm waiting to hear back from my DM. She'll make me an offer to take over the one store and I'll take it. She was supposed to get in contact with me on Monday.  I'm not nervous about not getting the job. I just want to find out how much I'd be making. More money means having cash to pay bills, rent and maybe a new car. Early estimates place me at having a roommate and an economy car. Which I'm okay with.  The next step after this is finding a REAL job. Retail management is not quite my life-long ambition.  ...And X-2 was uber. Saw it twice so far.

Granted, it is one of those cheap months that you don't get the full 31 days out of but oh, well.  Well, the summer movie season starts tomorrow. Who's going to see X2 with me?  And whopee, we get TWO Matrix movies this year. It's like finding dog crap on both of your shoes. Am I going to see them? Well, I have to have something of no importance to complain about and I don't know if I can wait for the last Lord of the Rings movie. Yes, Frodo Lives...and that's the problem.  Maybe Frodo and Sam will let go of their macho hobbit charade and GET IT ON. Just like Harry and Ron will in Book 5. Yes? No.

        ... And the reviews are in.  Just finished reading 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' and there is a reason that the book sold 5 million copies over the weekend. That's right 5,000,000. Now, I'm not one to scream praises from the hilltops... So the highest praise I can offer is this: If the book were a person, I wouldn't mind having a beer with it. That's it. For the more standard fare: The book was well written, Rowling has no trouble finding the voice of a 15 year-old, pacing of the story was excellent and etc. etc. At a robust 870 pages it moves right along and doesn't lag as much as the previous book. The only problem that I had with the book (it's one that I'm sure is is lighting up message boards everywhere) has to deal with the death of a main character. I'm not going to say who and ruin the surprise. That'd be low... But there was no body ... Or maybe I'm just in denile Even though this is book 5 of 7 it really feels like a mid-point to the series. Sweeping changes were made that should carry through the next two books. So are we going to have to wait until 2006 and 2009 for the next two?

         The Anti-update  This isn't a real post, just more of a reassurance that I still draw breath. And a warning... Don't be surprised to find that my site doesn't exist next month. See, my billing info has changed and I can't (or am not being allowed to) find a way to update it. The section of the site is "supposed to be up next week" and that was three weeks ago.  So we'll see, yes? Any complaints, complements, condiments or consolations can be sent to me via trancejedi7@aol.com that works if you have AIM also.  Who's ready for new H. Potter? Grethen, Dave, .Org, and my mom? Well, if my mom's into it... it's bound to be wide reaching pop culture event. Why, I even saw a guy with velvet cape at the mall today. But he was hanging out around the Hot Topic. Par for the course I suppose...  Well, I'm off to paint on my lightning-bolt scar...

        FahrFuckYouVhen  ...Is what I would say to my higher ups if I get a job with Volkswagen. My aunt (who works for said uber-company) keeps bugging me to put together my resume (pronounced 're-zoo-may') and she'll put in a good word for me.   Now, I am kind of leary of my relations 'putting in a good word for me.' Mostly because all my friends with family connections are still jobless. Then my aunt mentioned something about me getting a posting in the chicagoland area.  I nearly spilled my beer. Nearly.  Let's recap: 1) Working for the Master Race 2) Bitchin' employee discount 3) Far away from Michigan, the mall and even farther away from Ohio.  Fits all my requirements. In a perfect world I'll be tooling around Chicago in my Golf or Jetta being 20-something and looking damn good while doing it. Just like one of those shit sitcoms on NBC.  ("SitCom." Not really a word... More of an Americanization of two words. Situation +  Comedy=Sitcom. Two syllables in lieu of seven. Do yourself a favor, take the scenic route when speaking. You can appear smarter without actually BEing smarter. I've used this for years)

        What Ever Happened To...?  Marcy Playground. Hit it big with their song "Sex and Candy" back in '98. And that was it. The curse of the fickle public is what happened, everyone wants to hear "Sex and Candy" and nothing else. Which is a damn shame. The rest of their first record is excellent.  A couple years back they released "Shapeshifter" one of my all time favorite records. Seriously, go and buy this if you don't own it. Due to record industry shake-ups the third record ("MP3") is in limbo.  As I type, I'm sweaty with the anticipation of owning a bootleg copy of MP3. Now, I know bootleging is wrong and I'm only hurting the rich, rich record companies... But I will buy a real copy if and when it comes out.  That being said, one of the directors of The Matrix (it took TWO people to direct that?) is being hailed in the press as either a transvestive or potential trans-gender-er. This has nothing to do with him making a bad movie. The fact that he's a BAD DIRECTOR has everything to do with him making a bad movie. Let it be know that as I type this I'm wearing a sassy garter belt and panty combo... So soft...

        Skinny Man's Lament  Plowing thru a mall yesterday (not THE mall. Just A mall) and I happened upon a body mass index scale. If you're not familiar, I'll break it down like this: You insert 50 cents, select age, height and body type and then it gives you results.  I'm five pounds over-weight. Must be all that fast living I do.   Not that I'm bitching, but it is nice that all my pants fit now.

        Damn! Somebody got to it before I did!  Just picked up a cd today by MC Honky! called "I am the messiah." So... I'll have to rap under another name, seeing as this guy ( a.k.a: E from the eels) has it covered. It's a great, original CD check out mchonky.com, only because I haven't yet.  Tonight, I went to Buffalo Wild Wings. My punishment was getting a container of spicy garlic wings dumped in my crotch. Little bit of a drag... and it only adds to my hatred of public places. So, let the "tasty crotch" jokes begin!  The wedding on saturday was a wedding. And that's it. Everyone played their parts perfectly, everyone would be lucky to have such a great wedding. With an open bar. That's the Rosetta Stone for the wedding puzzle, free booze. You would all do well to remember that.

        Funny Books  Reading. The act which separates literate people from illiterate people. What you're doing right now (god willing). As of late, I've been reading books that have been written to be funny... with mixed results. I read "Knight Life" by Peter David and "Good Omens" by Neil Gaiman and some other guy.  "Knight Life" is a skewed modern take on the King Arthur legend. Take the King put him in modern NYC and watch the fish out of water hilarity ensue. Good but not great.  A solid 'B.'  "Good Omens" features two things I hate. The cover features the words 'a novel' and two it's a co-written book. Another 'B.' If it was under one author's control I feel it could have been a little more fully realized.   So, two books, both written to be funny... Were they? Yeah, but my sides haven't split. I did smile, smirk even... but laugh out loud? Nope. Humor is hard when put in the mold of the written word.

        ...Must...keep...going!  Crap in a hat! Tomorrow's friday! A day off! A pay-day!   But I still have to get up early, get a hair cut (gotta hide the gray), and make an appearance at work. I swear, if I can make it to the end of the week... I don't know where I was going with that. Something to the effect of "Give up 'blank'" or "Be a better..."  Okay.  I got it.  I'll give up caring and be a better drunk. There. I'm sure that made a lot of people happy.  Anyways, saw a FREE screening of "Pirates of the Walt Disney Ride" today. It was supposed to be "Leauge of Etc." but that fell thru. A free movie's a free movie, that's what I say. All in all a good flick. Johnny Depp owns the movie and if not for him this could've been a huge turd.  Still haven't seen 28 Days Later. I likes me some zombie movies. Maybe this weekend.

        Should've stayed in Chicago  It's been nothing but problems since I've gotten back. Demolition of my workplace started on Tuesday. I found this out on Monday. We stayed open today, even though we had no stock and our store was (is) a big hole in the wall.  If that wasn't enough, my car decided to take a shit on me. Several hundred dollars later, I'll be getting it back.  Now I have been stewing, so I gotta look for that silver bit around the big gray cloud.  Well, I get to find out about the wonderful world of car loans! And I get to find out what it's like to be in debt up to my ass! I've never felt more American  ....

        72 hours, 72 beers. Coincidence?  ... Or: 18 hours sober now. And not by choice.  My statement from the first was prophetic. I can hardly remember any of my weekend. That is thanks to a 12-pack of Miller Lite, a 30-pack of Pabst, and a 30-pack of Old Style. Let it be noted that I did not drink all 72 by myself. If I had I would be A) dead and 2) as great as I think I am. Also I'm not counting the drinks from the record release party we went to. Let's just say we had a few. A few being more than two by a bunch.  We got into town about midnight on thursday and stayed up til 5 drinking. Slept most of the day on the 4th went to a bar-b-q and then the previously mentioned party and then stayed up on my friend's roof until the sun started coming up. I'm sure the  neighbors loved us. More of the same on Saturday.  The only draw back to the trip was that we had let a bunch of other people know we were going to be down for the weekend. It's kind of hard to make it to lunch when you're passed out drunk. Y'know, I think that qualifies me for an intervention. Missing appointments and what not. And we had called a lot of people too. So we're sorry and we're giving up drinking (water).  Well, I'll be back in the city next month. You hear that Chicago? I'll be back for round three!  More on this trip as pictures get developed. Oh, boy...

        The Liver is Evil. It Must Be Punished.  Well, come thursday I'll be departing for Chicago for the 4th of July weekend. If all goes as planned I won't remember any of the trip to share with you.  And we're going to go to two deck parties in one night (!) If you follow the news in Chicago this may be of interest to you. But I have it on good authority that Allah will save us in the event of a deck collapse.  Salami & Bacon!

In all seriousness I did catch a few seconds, and it went a little something like this: Justin, 50cent, Justin, Justin, 50, Justin, 50/50.    Other News  Well it was bound to happen. It's new car time. Come Tuesday I'll have myself a new ride. Yes, one with a CD player AND Air Condtioning AND Heat. Watch out world 'cause I got brakes that work now.

        ...And God said unto Eric, "Plug one more into the outlet. What's the worst that could happen?"  ...Clearly he's a vengeful god.  I believe the old saying is: "Modern man is one hot meal and shave away from being a barbarian." ...or somesuch.  So how did I spend my thursday night? Why, I was protecting the fire from those who would try and steal it. Actually, I went for a nice post-curfew walk. It was nice to see my neighborhood in complete and utter darkness. I believe the term 'surreal' fits for once.   No street lights, no nothing. Just darkness. If I wasn't such a pillar of the community I would have gotten some good lootin' done.  Where I was when the lights went out: Work. When it became obvious that the lights wern't going to come back on any time soon (after about 5 min.), i went to my car to check out the deal on the radio.  To put it in the words of one lady passerby: "Holy shit."  Never before had I heard my plight descibed so eloquently.  So I went home. I was going to go early anyway, thanks to some disease-bag of a child who had infected me with some damn monkey-virus days earlier. Seriously, cover your mouth kid. I'm just now starting to shake this thing.  For the duration of the "BLACKOUT OF 2003" I lay on what felt like my death bed. Sweating, coughing and producing various pieces of modern art with my nose on the medium of tissue paper.  Then the power came back at about noon,I decided that I would not be dying today and hit the shower.  And then it took me two days to find a Burger King that was open.

        Detox  What a short weekend.  It was a weekend filled with beer, spending money and the unintentional neglect of ALL my friends. Yep ALL of 'em.  And, if I hadn't figured it out the first time, I've discovered that 3 days in Chicago is about the same as a long day in the real world.  When I quit my slave job for a career I'm going to spend a week down there. Do everything and see everyone.

        Gone Drinkin'....   Things were starting to look up there for a second... But what a shit week.   I'm going back to Chicago for one of my shortest trips on record: Thursday night to Sunday night. The SHORTEST trip on file is held by two of my friends that boozed and all night drove to Chicago.  When they got there they turned around and went back. They had college finals to take for god's sake!  That's what it feels like I'm doing.  It begins in T-minus 18 hours at the airport bar.  This one's for babies and Jesus.

The only reason I do this is to keep my skills (I use that term loosely) fresh.   I know very few people visit this site and I don't care. The running joke has been to install a counter on the site forever stuck at one and one half. Hell, Jo-Fixxx-It said he would visit more if I put up some Korean shit-porn.  So, I'll continue with my own myopic (look it up) view of the world. Making up nonsense stories when they need to be made up and generally having a good time.

        Right now...  Still recovering from last night. When I woke this morning it felt like I had either a railroad spike or icepick jammed in my left temple. Then it was off to work.  Gors brought by his (rented) Hemi earlier, went for a spin in that. Still felt a little green afterwords. But, damn, if that thing isn't fast.  Now it's late and I should be in bed. But here we are. Maybe some people are born daysleepers... I have to wonder how I'd function in the real world.

        I update because I must...  I just got finished doing an artist's bio for a web site. A step in the right direction I'd say. As soon as the site goes live all will be revealed (Artist AND Web address). Personally, I'm all worked up about it.  Other news...  Go buy the new Eels CD "Shootenanny!" One of the best listens I've had this year. It doesn't hurt that it helps me get thru a shift at work either. So buy it... hell, buy the whole Eels catalog while you're at it.  Tomorrow... later today? At any rate, I have a day off. So let's all go to the movies! And when I say 'let's all' I mean 'just me.' Time to go sit in a theater on a rainy day and enjoy an indy film... before the Main Art is bulldozed.  A shame, I know. I haven't read anything official yet, but that's the word on the street. I saw so many of my favorite movies (or films, depending on how snobby you are) "Chasing Amy" when I was in high school and most recently "Bowling for Columbine" and "Cowboy Bebop." There were also countless other movies I saw there from so-so to just plain weird. Now I feel a wee bit guilty I didn't see more of the cult classic films they ran on Friday and Saturday nights.  Well, from now on, whenever I go to Royal Joke (or Toke, whichever) I'll be sure to park my car in the lot where that theater once stood. Make sure to pour some out for your theater homies. Respect.

        Mr. Wiggles 9/10/03  On the subject of blogs:  "No one wants to read your online diary. No one. No one cares that your dad is 'Such an asshole' or your mom 'sucks hard.' No one gives a fuck about your 'stupid trig test' tomorrow. The only people who come to your site are your equally lame-ass friends and perverts like me, looking for pictures of you in your underwear. I say, get rid of all the writing, invest in a high-end digital camera, and post more pictures of you in that hot pink thong you know I like."  When you're right, you're right.

        Ho-lee shit...  This is as close to "instant karma" that I'm ever going to get...  So, last month I went to Chicago (yep) at some point in time I gave a copy of my friend's cd (Jo-Fixxx-it: Broken, hermitsite.com. Buy two!) to the guys @  40 oz. Comics (The cool cats who drew my picture. Go to their site.) they in turn pass the cd off to tlchicken.com.  Turns out this website reviewed his cd and loved it! Now I'm as pleased as piss for Fixxx getting the recognition he deserves. Who knew all this good karma would come from something I'd almost forgotten I'd done?  Now we send them Eye Spy's cd...

        Well, since you asked...  Over the last week or so I've had quite a few of my relations, well-wishers and hangers-on of my family ask me "So, what about your writing?"  Now, it would be nice (albeit, uncharacteristic) of me if I could give them a straight answer. It usually starts with "Well, ya see..." and ends with "...because I need to eat/pay bills/live."  Don't get me wrong, I do have some ideas. But the creative process is much like the time Gors took twice the recomeneded dose of Keopectate and didn't dump for about a week. What I'm trying to get across is that there is quite a bit of working, straining, sweating and screaming before you're left with something you're proud of. (I do realize how all this ties together and all I can say is that it's all true).  So, yeah. I gots an idea. Now what do I do with it?

        Marvel's Epic line tanks...Again.  This update's for the comic book fans... As the headline stated Marvel's line of creator-owned comic books (Epic) has gone down the tubes again after only 3 titles. Epic will still exist but will focus on film projects and whatnot.  Marvel's mistake was making the risky move of starting off the line with a romance book. Sometimes risks pay off but not in this case. And they got a decent writer too! I'll read almost anything Mark Millar puts out, but I simply have no interest in romance. Ask any of my ex-girlfriends, hey-oh!  No my dreams of producing a Marvel/creator-owned comic have exploded on the launch pad. Along with the dreams of Dan and Heidi (Now they finally have their names in  print). But this is about me! ME!  So... back to self-publishing?

        The Final Flight of the Intrepid  Got rid of my old car yesterday, but not before one final injustice. While trying to check under my seat I set off the car alarm. Had to go back into the dealership get my keys and shut off the alarm. Then I gave the car the finger and sped off in my new ride.  My new car is new. That's all I can say. Only had six miles on it. SIX! That's a trip to Burger King.

        Halloweenie  Oh, yes. The day is almost upon us.  Given my background in folklore (I took a few classes, hardly enough to qualify me as an expert. But close enough for funk, I say) I wanted to pass on some good ol' spooooky stories. All of them true. All of them involving me. Mostly because I can't write about anything else...  When I was in seventh grade I was finally allowed to go trick-or-treating on my own. Given my new found freedom the night hardly seemed long enough, but in hindsight it seemed to go on forever.  Everything happened in one night. About five or six of my friends and I set out for  the uncharted territories east of our old elementary school. By the end of the night we had been jumped by some other guys from our junior high (they wanted candy, but didn't want to work for it) and we had pillowcases full of loot. In my 12 years on the planet I had never seen such a haul. But I digress.  The weather was what you typically expect from October. Not chilly enough to be cold, but cold enough so that smells carried for miles ( Candles in pumpkins, dead leaves, etc.). Half the group had gone home leaving me and two of my cohorts to travel down a dark street.  As we meandered down the street a figure came around the bend. He was taller than any man I had ever seen before and dressed as some kind of hooded monk. Clothed in a brown robe and sandals (yes, sandals) he carried a long staff topped with a crucifix. But no candy. Not even an apple with a razor blade in it or any of the other stuff you would expect a psycho to carry.  The closer he got to us was directly proportional to how scared we got. By the time he stood directly in front of us we realized that we could not see his face. It was covered mostly by his hood and some kind of dime store mask. But that wasn't important. He stopped. We stopped.  And there we stood.  Some one said "hey" or "what up" to him. He just moaned or grunted. And then silence.  Then he shuffled past us.  We watched him walk down the street and turn at the corner.  Then we ran like hell.  No one was ever going to believe this.

        "...And even if nobody loves you, you've still got the love of the loveless."  Sage words.  I saw the Eels perform on Sunday night and it was awesome. I went with my cousin and his girlfriend, had a great time and still insist that anyone who reads this buy the entire Eels catalog of records.  While at the show I more than started to realize that I have fallen into a "look." Ah yes, a "look." Thick-frame glasses, messy hair and a general feeling of ennui place me squarely within some kind of sub-culture. Geek Chic, perhaps.  Not sure how I feel about this. But I do feel the need to claim that I dressed this way first and that I have never, ever, been cool.   Speaking of not cool (clever segue), I was able to cultivate a strong distaste for the kid in front of me. There's a difference between being into a sub-culture and trying too hard.  This guy was the latter.  From his opening statements about R.E.M.'s last tour ("I mean, I LOVED 'Reveal' but, c'mon, play some stuff from 'Murmur!'") to his corduroy blazer (complete with band buttons) and his Yo La Tengo t-shirt, this guy was born to be on my shit list.  Now, I normally have a very "live and let live" attitude (believe it or not). But when the level of bull shit being cranked out is enough to gag an old cattle farmer, I tend to cast a very critical eye upon the shitter.  He danced like everyone should be watching him and not the band, yelled about how drunk he was getting and (sigh) high-fived his buddy when their favorite song came on.  I hate. I hate a lot.  But the man know as E and his band out shone all of this. I had a great time.

        Wes Szarejko: Old Woman Magnet  I think the title says it all.  Some older lady, who had more to drink than us, could not get enough of my friend Wes.  Personally, I think Wes should've thrown her a bone. But that's just me.

        E.A.'s Bookclub 2.0  After you've gone to Markchristopher.us, purchased his cd and had a lengthy meditation on how Ohio should be given back to the natives...Read these books.  "Fugitives and Refugees" and "Diary" both by Chuck Palahniuk. One's true the other's not. Guess which one?  "Blankets" by Craig Thompson. If you've grown up in the mid-west over the last 15 years or so, you should be issued this "illustrated novel" (Re: comic book).  It's over 500 pages long. Don't be scared, I read it in one sitting. But only because I don't have a real job.  Go see Kill Bill too.

        The Shame to the South  Just got back from Cincinati. Feh.  I had to drive down for a work-related meeting stay the night and drive back.  Now, it's a well known fact that when you're entering Ohio the sign reads: "Ohio... You've sinned in a previous life!" And it's true. It's the most boring state of the union well past Montana and Idaho.  However, I did win an award for "Best Penetration" (?) Of course it was in reference to sunglass and watch sales. I did find it hard to accept the award with a straight face.

        Soft, soft Man-Hands  Those would be mine. I was informed yesterday that I have unusually soft hands for a dude. Caught unawares I could only respond: "I... moisturize."  I spent the rest of the night inviting people to partake of my soft, soft man-hands.   I'm going to try healing people next.

        Old Man Strikes Back  Amazon.com. What a way to go about reclaiming your youth. I just picked up Jim Henson's The Storyteller on DVD (the ONLY way to view things, or so they tell me). So, yeah, "The Storyteller"...all sorts of fables and fairytales retold WITH MUPPETS! Or, more accurately, puppets from Henson's creature shop.  It's awesome. Try and deny it. You know you can't.

        Creative Windfall  I feel like writing a play. So I guess that means I'm going to.  Now, the play is the thing. But, what's the thing about? Need some inspiration. How did they do it in the old days?  Peyote and Absinthe?  Hmm, That'll probably get me naked and arrested. Again.  Well, off to find inspiration.... it's a big world.

        Sittin' 'round the campfire...  Makin' prank phone calls. Like the pioneers used to.  Some friends of mine, the Triad of Mikes, are still in the mind-set of finding prank phone calls funny. Which is good. The last time I didn't find a prank call funny was the Jerky Boys movie. Try and think of a semi-dramatic situation in which a prank call MUST be made.  Pretty hard, huh?  Now think of enough situations to fill one 90-min. dog turd of a movie. Not very funny, eh?  Back to the topic at hand. If there ever was a reason to get your name taken out of the phone book, these guys are it. God help you if your name is Richard Handler.  I think they may have broke the mold by calling an Alaskan cab company and asking for a pick-up in Michigan. The call lasted in excess of 5 min.   "There's an Eskimo on my porch! He's drunk-as-shit and you need to come get him!"

      Eat & Drink  ...and so it goes every thanksgiving. I had quite a bit to eat today, hitting both sets of grandparents houses.  My grandmother on my mom's side pulled this one out at dinner (in typical grandma fashion): "I want everyone to think of one thing that they're thankful for and keep it to themselves."  Inside my head: "............" or "(elevator music)" whichever you feel is apt.  So I drew a blank. I guess I was just trying not to think of the obvious stuff.  So, who's thankful for what?

        Keeping Busy  Sometimes I set the bar too high, even for myself.  This week's project-of-the-moment is an E.A. X-mas cd. It's chock full of all sorts of weird holiday music weird people. If you see me ask for one. I should be done with the first batch of them by the end of the week.   Sometimes, I wonder if I keep myself busy to keep from thinking about things I'd rather not think about.

Two folks who know far more about computers than anyone ever should. I'll have their sites linked on the side of the page. Peep!  Also every post now concludes with a comment button.

      E.A. Cubed  I'm still in the getting-to-know-you phase of my new job. What I've gotten-to-know is that a vast majority of my co-workers are incredible cynics.   So I should be right at home, yes?  Not necessarily. It may be that I have no intention of having my soul crushed that gives me pause. A lot of the other cube-dwellers don't have much outside their cubes. Hopes, dreams, aspirations, or even, sweaty, sweaty fantisies. Nothing.  Theirs is a cynacism that has been earned. Mine is just a charming defense mechanism.

        Precious Things  Up until yesterday, the last time I had to suffer the indignity of buying a PINK cd was in 1995 (Sunny day Realestate's eponymous cd). There aren't really many places I could go with this post... it's just me putting myself up for criticism again.  As for what the cd was? Well, I'm sure someone who reads this has an idea (Hell, I seldom know what I'm talking about). I guess this is just my open love letter to whoever that is.

Well, it was good. Not quite uber yet, but I've got  a ways to go.  Being on a set schedule and not working weekends is going to rule. More time to devote to my writing and more time to sleep late on Saturdays.  Updates on office life to follow...

        Wayne Henson: Hardcore  My dad is home from the hospital and recovering from his shoulder surgery. He had some kind of nasty little son-of-a-bitch called a bone spur removed from his shoulder.  Last night was spent mostly in a post-op haze and today he sat around and watched movies. Here's the fun part: He's only taking his pain meds (750 mg Vicodin) when it's time for bed. Having been laid open less than 24 hrs ago he's dealing with the pain in a fashion that is no less than super human. Or stupid.  And he could probably still whip my ass with his left arm. Respect.

        WORST. MOVIE. EVER!  So, Gors and I went to see the Matrix for a larf... to see how bad it was. I had no idea that anything could have been worse than the last installment. But here we are.  I can structure my entire argument around these two lines of dialog from the movie:  BAD CHILD ACTOR: Are you from the matrix? NEO (monotone, sleepy): Yes. No. I don't know.  I could go on and on about how I hated this movie. It'd make me very happy. But it would also be beating a dead horse. This movie was terrible. Avoid at all costs. Anyone who tells you they liked it is either lying or retarded.  Oh, and, Neo and Trinity die. They don't beat the machines, they call a cease fire. AND they leave it open for a sequel.  God help us.

Pick a house at random, sit in bushes.  Wait for telemarketer to call (So alone).  Light lunch.  Work on beard.  Go to pet store, yell at goldfish.  Get out the white pages, look for Peter Gozinya.  Call Mr. Gozinya.  Look in mirror, reflect.  Quick shower and cry. Dinner with the folks. Gotta keep up appearances. Then it's time for mischief...

        Return of the Halloweenie  Never did carve that pumpkin.   Anyways, went to some party about an hour away from where I live. It was in a field. Newcastle and Jim Beam were the order of the night.  I'm told I disappeared into the woods for somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 + min. Eventually I came back. Where I went...no one knows.  Work was a mess on Saturday. But that was my own fault and I'm okay with that.

      Never really did get to that part of the post.  "When we last left our intrepid hero is was three-thirty, Christmas Morning..."  Well, I had made it home alive. My other Christmas gift to myself.  X-mas was, as usual, spent with my dad's side of the family. And it was good. Aside from a mild rough patch...everything went as it should.  Saturday I went on a mild bender with Gors, Byers and Jo-jo Nasty. And when I say 'mild' that translates to 'only spent part of sunday in bed.' I must be getting old, we all had trouble keeping up with each other.   Ah, well. Que sera, sera...

      It's four in the morning, the end of December  I'm writing you now just to see if you're better  New York is cold, but I like where I'm living  There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening.  I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert  You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record.   Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair  She said that you gave it to her  That night that you planned to go clear  Did you ever go clear?   Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older  Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder  You'd been to the station to meet every train  And you came home without Lili Marlene   And you treated my woman to a flake of your life  And when she came back she was nobody's wife.   Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth  One more thin gypsy thief  Well I see Jane's awake --   She sends her regards.   And what can I tell you my brother, my killer  What can I possibly say?  I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you  I'm glad you stood in my way.   If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me  Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free.   Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes  I thought it was there for good so I never tried.   And Jane came by with a lock of your hair  She said that you gave it to her  That night that you planned to go clear --   Sincerely, L. Cohen    leonardcohen.com urlLink

      So, Christmas was good to me. How 'bout you?  Christmas Eve my mom's side of the family came over and made various noises and smells. Then it was off to the church for my bi-annual pilgrimage of being a seat holder.  From there I went out to the House that Gors built. His family is spending the holiday in Arizona and he, like I, has to work. So I brought the Christmas noise and Jo-Fixxx-It showed up also. I ended up staying there until the wee hours of the morning....Three friends sitting, talking, playing video games and making the holiday their own.  I left his house at about three a.m. It had snowed and the roads were for crap. I threw in the X-mas CD I had made and took the long way home. No one else was on the road, it was just me and my thoughts. My Christmas gift to myself.

       I just got some CDs from my cousin  urlLink MarkChristoper.us  (plug,plug,plug), and they all rule.  1) urlLink The Flaming Lips "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots"  A lot of people have been bugging me to get this disc for a while. I have it now and it's great. Very sonicly (is that a word? I should know...) layered and interesting to listen too. Put on an animal suit and dance around.  2) urlLink Electric Six "Fire"  I'm not sure what to make of this disc yet. It's loud, which is always cool. It's fun. Details to follow.  3) urlLink Starsailor "Love Is Here"  Don't know where these guys come from. It's in the quiet and moody vein with a little bit of a Radiohead vibe. Only it makes more sense. It's also not quite as bland as Coldplay. I'm going to see them at St. Andrew's next month...  I can safely recommend these CDs to anyone reading this. Who's listening to what now?

      That quote is from William Dement. He wrote a bunch of books on the study of sleep. So act like you know, got it?  Last night I had a dream where I was receiving Christmas cards from certain un-named parties.   Within the context of the dream the cards were entirely surprising, given that I would have never expected one from said person or persons. Even though I was surprised, the card provided an odd sense of comfort.  Aside from being a passing entry in a dream journal, I find myself wondering what it all means. So I'll be taking a trip to the ol' book store to consult the thickest "Dream Dictionary" or other volume of pop-psychology that I can find.

      All things said and done, I walked away from the Office Christmas party with...a fondue set.  Everyone else got a bottle of booze. Not me. I get the joy of fondue.  How the system works: You bring in one wrapped and unmarked gift, get a ticket and when your number's called you have the oportunity to: a) pick a mystery gift or b) steal someone's previously unwrapped gift.  I chose 'a.' Foolishly. I thought I was getting a Jack D. gift set. Surprise! Fondue.  Someone shouted I should keep it at my desk.  Well, I'm off to make fondue.  Son of a bitch.

      On sunday NBC showed the modern classic "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation." Fully edited. My dad and I sat and watched some of it and laughed at the spots where the funny was supposed to be.  The other day the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company, act like you know) ran the movie in all it's filthy glory. We laughed harder.  American censorship is a strange beast.

      Went to the store last night in search of Dr. Pepper. What I walked away with was somthing far better (in addition to the Dr. P).  While I was parking my car I spied an unattended shopping cart. On the lower rack of the cart (y'know the place where you put things when you want to forget them) was a 12-pack of the old butt tape. Free toilet paper.  So I looked... No one around for miles. I invoked the rule of finders keepers and the t.p. was mine.  Once inside the store I saw that there was a sale on CDs. Sgt. Pepper's for only $10? Too good to pass up.   And I got my Dr. Pepper too.  As far as days go, this one was alright.

      I went and saw Rufus Wainwright tonight. The show was great I was there with some of my friends and a good time was had by all parties involved.  After the show I went looking for my cousin Mark Christopher and his girlfriend Bethany (see that link on the right? Click it after you're done reading this) Sadly, I didn't find either of them.  So I decided to wait out in front of Saint Andrews for a bit, the chances of me seeing them being a bit better. Instead I saw Rufus Wainwright. Got his autograph, shook his hand etc.  Dumb luck strikes again.

      "Marked by abundant inventiveness or productivity  "  Or  When it rains it pours. I was unable to sleep last night because I had to many ideas rattling around in my head. So I got up and scribbled down some ideas in my trusty... Journal? Notebook? I don't want to call it a diary.  No. That sounds like somewhere I write down my secret crushes. Haven't had one of those in the better part of a decade.  Eventually, when the Sandman schooled me with his blackjack full of dream sand, sleep came. But not for long. I feel asleep on my arm and woke to a cold dead thing attached to my shoulder. I thought I had stroked out while I was sleeping. But I didn't smell toast.  So instead of pins & needles I was treated to cotton & railroad spikes. What a way to start the day at five A.M.  Why can't my ideas come at a more reasonable hour? Perhaps when I'm in the bath? Or writing in my pink, frilly diary?

Considering that I've been here 2 months I think it's understandable that I've grown tired of looking at his shit.  Now my cube is very orderly, very...German. Some may say uber, even.  I spoke with my cube-neighbor and he informed me that the previous guy was "a very odd bird indeed."  "More so than me?" I inquired.  "Is that possible?"

      Is pretty much how I spent my Saturday. The basic premise of the above mentioned party is: Buy a keg of cheap beer and a pack of red plastic Solo cups, charge 5 bucks a head and invite everyone and their friends.  Which is about where I came in. The friend of a friend part. Funny part was the place I was going to was actually the place of some one I used to work with. So I didn't feel bad about putting in $5 for shit beer. Keeping kids off the streets. A good thing.  So now my coat smells like a poor person (stale cigarette smoke, which, after a fashion, smells like urine). And all I got out of it was some damn goofy picture and...and...that's about it.  I should have stayed in.

      I'm really starting to sail in muddy waters here. Because, I have a personal trainer. I guess he comes with the membership. A word of advice for those of you thinking to join a gym: Stay away from the personal trainers. They can, and will, hurt you.  I guess my primary goal here is to hide from my trainer. The goal of getting buff like "......" is secondary. (The new game is whenever I use that phrase, substitute some actor that underwent crazy physical training for a film. Example: Hugh Jackman in 'X-2'. Fun!).  Actually, I take that back. The real primary goal is to stay away from the guys who run around balls-naked in the locker room. Secondary: Hide from trainer.  Tertiary(? Putting the English degree to use here): Buff like "......"  Ahhh. I think I blew something out while typing this.  I can't believe I've joined a gym and have a trainer. Everything in my life has gone wrong.

      More likely than not, the answer is no.  However, I did join a gym. Why, swimsuit season is only 6 months away!  All kidding aside, I really need to boost my activity levels. I've yet to determine the exact bit of  my subconscious that spurned me to join a gym. Hell, I haven't even seen a commercial for a gym lately, and I know how susceptible I am to advertising.  Predictably, I did feel out-of-place walking into the gym. Every fiber of my being was screaming for me to run, smoke a pack of cigarettes, down a burger and drink a case of beer. I could deal without the other people there too.  You know, the guys (and gals) flexing in front of the mirrors. Making eye contact with only themselves. Secretly starting to fantasize about their reflections coming out of the mirror and having their way with...themselves.  That's why I'll be sticking to the machines. No free-weights for me. No sir.  The best bit is the trainer they want to set me up with. Some chach that started talking about customizing my diet and work out plan. Apparently, the phrase "Dude, I just want to hit the bikes and a couple of machines and be done in an hour" doesn't translate with these folks. Maybe if I'd flexed it...?  If I start shaving my chest, please, someone stage an intervention.

      I had another one of "those weekends." Not exactly a lost weekend by any stretch of the imagination, but more weird than most by a furlong. Saturday started out kind of quiet. Went to a bar and sat in a corner.  Took part in a Miller Light/Bud Light taste test. You could tell which one had been watered down, so I guessed the opposite and won a prize. A neat-o Miller flashing button! I hate Miller. Hmm, I hate light beer too.  After the bar was an after party, a new concept to me. There I got to watch, against my will, mind you, Villa wrestle a naked man into submission.   We walked in and there it was: Fight Club with no pants. Kind of hard not to look at. Very easy to run away from. I left feeling better about myself.  I did get this from somebody: "Has anyone ever told you that you look like that guy on TV (blank)?" I politely replied 'yes' and wondered why looking like a grade 'B' pseudo-celebrity was cause for celebration.  I also got this one: "Hey, fuck that guy!" (points at me). No, that wasn't a request to have me buggered. I was just minding my own business and offended someone. But, I'm okay with that.  Another Saturday night turned Sunday morning.

      While I was waiting for the concert to start yesterday I stood in the freezing cold doing battle with all of Detroit's elements. That gray salt slush, winds that'll strip the skin from your bones, and the homeless.  Yes, I did get my mini American flag. Doing my part to help out the veterans. Or something along those lines.  While I'm thinking of it...Why did I get singled out? The three pop-punk high school girls behind me were flush with cash and new "torn" clothes from the Hot Topic.   Karma I guess.  Starsailor was great, especially for it being the first night of their tour. The opening act was something from the Howie Day-John Mayer camp. He was good...but nervous.  My right ear is still ringing.

      Sitting at my desk right now, waiting for lunch to end. I could go back to work early...that statement is so dumb I won't even finish it.  Can't wait to get on out of here, I'm going to see Starsailor tonight.  Yesterday was a great day for work. Took my lunch at noon and the office closed at three. Something about snow or something.   Even though I'm legally considered an adult, snow days still rule.

      Took some quizzes on quizilla.com. Ready? Here we go!  Movie I most belong in: Fight Club  How evil am I?: Mostly evil  Music knowledge: I should work at the record store from that Cusak movie  Greek god: Morpheus  Element: Water  Personality: Artistic  Simpsons character: Mr. Burns  X-men character: Professor X  Star Wars knowledge: Jedi Master  Most of these I agree with...and no I didn't go back and alter the quizzes as I saw fit.  Ah, the quiz. The great equalizer of mankind.

      Saturday.  Went to The Magic Stick with Wes and Co. All the hippest suburbanites and Wayne State expatriates gather there to listen to rock bands that start with "The" and bowl.  Got lit on the way down there and Wes started causing trouble as soon as we got in the door. While I'm not exactly privy to the nature of the comment he made to this girl, she was going to "kick his ass" and "take all of you fuckers on."  We where there for a while before we bailed. Returned to the safehouse, drank some beers and peed in/on/around things that were never meant to be peed in/on/or around. All things considered, a pretty full night.  A full night that ended about 4:45 this morning.  I don't exactly consider my life a mess, but this is a good start.

      Went and saw David Bowie on Friday. I have to say that the show was exactly what I expected...Exceptional. He played for about 2 1/2 hours and had some excellent between song banter with the audience.  He played the 'classics' and some new stuff. I'd go again if I had the chance. Pretty spry for a 57 year old man. And, yes, he did play "Panic In Detroit." Four songs into the set, no less. I suppose it's good he got it out of the way early.  "Detroit, you crazy bunch of motherfuckers!" Always sounds better when coming from a sophisticated Brit.

      I do mean the day of the week. I don't have any feelings of ill will toward the ice cream and hot fudge.  When I was younger (if that's possible) I always hated the seventh day of the week because it served as a reminder of what was to come. All the home work I had not done and having to go back to school for another five days.  That's probably why I opted not to pursue teaching as a vocation.  "Good morning, students. I know you hate being here, but Mr. Henson hates being here more. Read chapter three while I sleep under my desk."  I can work my way through a Monday, it's just the ticking clock that is Sunday I can't stand. Now, Fridays and Saturdays...those are my days. Wednesdays are cool too (new comic day). Thursdays I'm kind of indifferent to.  Wait. 'The Cosby Show' used to be on Thursdays and I hate that show. Fuck you Thursday! You too, Sunday!  I've been writing a lot lately. That must mean I'm getting ready to do something stupid. What it is, no man can say.   Well, I feel like I've accomplished something. I've declared war on two days of the week. That must count for something.

      Can't sleep.  Oh, don't get me wrong, I'd like to. I just can't. What with all the injustice in the world and all....   It feels like I'm not firing on all eight cylinders right now. Doing anything other than staring at the idiot box is a major chore. Like writing this post. Do you know how long it took me to write this paragraph? The answer ain't pretty.  I may as well tell a story.  My dad's best friend went to U of M during the late 60's. (Now, if that's not an adequate job of setting the scene, I don't know what is.) He lived in an apartment building with, logically, a bunch of other college students.  His upstairs neighbor worked on a rather interesting schedule. Speed (amphetamines) to stay up and cram and then a little of the "ol' herb" to relax. So, for most of the semester he was awake and with nothing to do.  Well with copious amounts of free time and the advent of cable T.V. years away, he was left to his own devices. What is one to do? The answer: Read Webster's Dictionary. Four times.  The kicker to the story is that he used to incorporate all his new knowledge in to his vocabulary. And it worked! He was able to amass a tremendous understanding of the English language, thanks to drugs.  I'm not saying this is the right way (in fact, it's pretty far from right). But wow, you've got to admire his commitment.  So I salute you sir! Thanks for making insomnia your bitch and giving hope to the rest of us.  I'm going to call it a night. I've realized that this degenerated into non-sensical rambling somewhere around the second paragraph.

      New Year's Resolutions...Who's going to make 'em? Not I.  If anything, I sould resolve not to change for this coming year, or, change for the worse.  I do suppose that the concept of 'starting fresh' is a compelling one to many people. What's the fun of starting fresh? Throwing away everything doesn't sound good at all.  Well, I'm off to take up smoking and politics.

      Year in review '03  Looking back on the year that was, I can see that it was split into two parts. I say parts and not halfs because things in life are rarely symmetrical. Sure it would be nice and tidy if my year went: January to June and then July to December.   The two parts of the year would have to be labeled 'decent' and 'so-so.' I'm not about to say which part of '03 was which...that would be telling. Needless to say, I went through a few changes this year and I was able to make it out alive. Albeit a little different, but alive.  Well, here's to absent friends and the year that was.

      2/28/04: 8:17 p.m.  Running east down 9 mile road last night, I almost stopped to wonder why I hadn't stopped at an ATM  prior  to seeing my cousin's gig. How was I to know there would be a five dollar cover?  Regardless, I ran down 9 mile, across (and up) Woodward to the nearest ATM.   Or so I thought.  The nearest ATM was, in fact, two buildings (in the opposite direction) from the cafe where my cousin was playing. It found this out on the way back to my car, which was parked in front of said ATM.  Back to what's important.  My cousin, Mark Christopher, put on an awesome show despite the fact that he was near losing his voice. I'm sure if it was going then, it's gone now. Talk about sacrificing for your art...  The next show is April 1st. Mark your calendars.  The remainder of my night unfolded in this order: Drinking and playing pool. Then drinking and getting shot with a BB gun.   Just when you think you've hit bottom....  Current mood: After the fact.... Current music: EyeSpy: Semantix

      As far as days go this one gets a thumbs up...  Got an e-mail with from my boss telling everyone in the office that I had dealt with the most clients yesterday and that everyone else could "suck it." In my acceptance speech I stated that "I have no one left to envy. I envy you for having me to envy." Most of this is true.  Got my $1,000 Herman Miller Aeron chair delivered to my desk.  (An aside: The gentleman who delivered my chair asked me if I had signed for it yet. I said 'no.'  To which he replied, "That's cool, man. They'll just take it out of your check." I went pale (-er than usual). He was only joking.)  Then my Aunt delivered unto me a donut from a place called "Krispy Kreme."  Current mood: Smug Current music: Mr. Zebra

      Man, is it ever nice outside today. So, of course, that makes me less than willing to be sitting at my desk right now. The thing with Michigan is that you never know if winter is still lurking around the corner, waiting to bitch slap you with a blizzard or some other nonsense.  Still, it's the simple things that make life worth living. Driving to get my lunch with the window down...made it all worth while. Why, soon it'll be warm enough to drink outside, pass out and not be in any immediate danger of frost bite.  Today would have been a great day to take it easy. Sit on the porch and just exist...

      Goddamnit! It's not "Kitchen Fresh Chicken"...it's "Kentucky Fried Chicken!"  The only reason KFC started using the short-hand version of their name was not beacuse "it's not chicken any more"....It's because they didn't want the word 'Fried' in their name! Once people figured out that fried food isn't exactly good for you they knew they were fucked! And now they're trying to change what their name means!  Don't fall for it!

      Why does Adam Sanlder make movies?  The answer may surprise you...To keep Rob Schneider working. It's true. Schneider pops up in damn near every Sandler movie. Cajun guy, Delivery guy, Cajun guy in hell. And now... Hawaiian guy (In the yet-to be released 50 First Dates)  In case you haven't seen the trailer for this crap, I'll break it down for you...It's essentially "Memento" for retards. Drew Barrymore (....) plays a woman with no short-term memory. Adam Sandler plays the man who loves her. Rob Schneider as Sandler's Hawaiian side kick.  But wait! What about all Schneider's other movies? Read the credits! All produced by Adam Sandler.  Why all this? Rob Schneider is the devil and Adam Sandler has a contract with him. It's the only way I can explain their mutual success.

They did a lot to go beyond their novelty act appearance, who would have thought that they're actually talented musicians?  I've never really understood the purpose of concert reviews other than "it was a great show, why didn't you go?" So, I'll just say that this show had everything..even costume changes.  Don't forget, the only person who will rock you harder is  urlLink Mark Christopher . On April 1st.

      Out today: The new Marcy Playground record, cleverly titled, "MP3" (see it's their  third  record, MP  3 ...Get it?). Anyways, I got a bootleg copy of this CD about a year ago and it was awesome, I didn't think that it could get any better. Low and  behold, after some finishing touches, it's one of their best efforts.  Go to their website  urlLink marcyplayground.com   Has anybody heard anything about the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs? All I know is that MTV is telling me to like them, and MTV would never lead me astray. Right? Should I believe the hype? C'mon, they were nominated for a Grammy. A Grammy! Seriously, has anyone heard anything good, bad, or indifferent?  Don't forget  urlLink Mark Christopher  on April 1st! No it's not a gag! Stay out late!

      I wanted a new tie.  A simple want, I know, just something to make my wardrobe a little more respectable. With that in mind, I went to the mall where they have ties.  Admittedly, I know very little of fashion. If a tie is anything other than a primary color or has a pattern to it, I'm sunk. So I usually need help matching a shirt with a tie.  Somehow I had found my way into a men's clothing store where disco music blared and many of the fashions confused and frightened me. Nevertheless, I had found a tie that I could not match with my shirt. I was lost.  Enter the salesman whom I asked for help, or to at least direct me to a saleswoman (who would have better fashion sense than someone with a 'Y' chromosome). I never thought he would one-up my expectations.  He called over another salesman who can only be described as Prince's twin mixed with a little James Brown. He immediately dismissed two of the ties as "boring" and what follows is a direct transcription of our conversation:  "Well, honey, I just don't know 'bout those two. But I would go with this one if you want to be daring."  I was faced with questions I had never before pondered. Do I care about things beyond the tie matching? Does this tie match? Do I want to be daring?  Anyways, I decided to buy the tie and it does match my shirt.  Thank you gay, black man... urlLink where ever you are .

      Yesterday, I indulged my inner child yet again and went on a toy hunt with fellow geek Villa (his link is on the side of the page). When I say "toys" I do mean action figures and the like. Star Wars, Transformers, even G.I. Joe. All part of my plan to escape adulthood and remain juvenile forever.  The toy hunt can be traced back to man's earliest hunting and gathering instincts. In the modern world food & shelter are almost givens leaving modern man to fill the void with other things (baseball cards, comic books, plates from the Franklin Mint). Now, that I've intellectually justified it  to myself... I needs that super-poseable Clone Wars Clone Trooper! Gah! It continues to elude me!  I could also go on to say that I'm trying to "buy back" my childhood one piece at a time. "Why did you have to throw away all my toys mommy? Why?" Clearly there could be some deeply rooted psychological factors coming into play here. Regardless, toys are fun and I like fun things. Ergo, I like toys.  Anyways, the toy hunt covered multiple cities, townships and even two counties. What did we find? That Wal-Mart is a white trash mecca (we already knew that), Meijer stores are open 24 hours for a reason and....Absolutely nothing, that's what. Still, it was a fun way to kill a couple hours and a quarter-tank of gas.  I also learned that Black Widow venom is an untraceable poison. Untraceable.  It's hardly Homer's "The Odyssey." But it's the closest we'll get in suburbia in this day and age....and that's alright with me.

Thank God I showered this morning or else the stench would be unbearable.  I just didn't have any great motivation to leave the house today. That, and the outside is scary.  Oh, if I could only play this out longer...   Well, it's back to the grind tomorrow. A world of pants and people, cabbages and kings.  Current mood: World weary.

      Gather 'round young ones... I'm gonna tell you all about a little hole in the wall called the Locker Room Saloon.  I'll preface the story with the supposition that everyone knows Flint, Michigan is the armpit of the state. Nothing Michael Moore can say, or do, will ever change this. Now, by making Flint the armpit we can extrapolate that The Locker Room (located right here in Utica, MI) would be some kind of festering pimple on the back of the state.  That being said, The Locker Room is a charming local tradition of the tri-county area where young and old gather to bang on things with sticks. Yes, a bar where drunk folk are encouraged to be wacky and drum on anything and everything.  The Locker Room experience unfolds as such.  Pay a $5 cover to get through the door and stand in line. You are then presented with one (1) playing card and two (2) "drum sticks." I use the quotes because the sticks are actually doll rods, roughly the same size of drum sticks.  Anyways. You're ordered to get your fist drink at the bar and then mingle. I should have put mingle in quotes because you're really standing shoulder to shoulder with some dude that reeks of 'Drakar' and puts turtle wax in his hair and some woman who out weighs me by at least 50 pounds. Nothing against her, I'm a skinny white man so it's not hard to be larger than me.  You're then assigned a section. Red, blue, yellow, left side of bar or right side of bar. The section also comes with a waiter bearing a clever  nom de guerre  like "Tackleberry," "Beaker," or even, "Cooter."   Then there's the DJ.  Imagine every shitty wedding DJ that you've ever come across, okay? Now, when these men eventually hang themselves in a closet somewhere or drink anti-freeze their damned souls are funneled into this one being of pure evil.  Yes, a man so evil that he will pick you out of a crowd and order you to have a good time by leading the rest or the bar in the "Hustle" or "Chicken dance." He also serves to pit different sides of the bar against another in shouting matches...only to declare that everyone's a winner so the "prize" of dollar shooters goes to all.  So that's the basic premise. People stand on furniture and bang on things with sticks. (An aside, I once heard that the sticks were outlawed for a time because a fight broke out and someone was stabbed with one. I'm not stating this as the Bible truth, only a colorful urban legend. Way better than the murder house.)  I almost forgot about the playing cards! The playing card that you're given when entering, in theory, has a double that's given to a member of the opposite sex. So, you could hook-up with somebody solely on the basis that "we're both 'sixes'!"  This is how my parents met.  The Locker Room is a hive of scum and villainy, the likes of which I haven't seen since the Mos Eisley cantina in  Star Wars . It's small, cramped, stinky and, worst of all, my Budweiser was warm. It's not fun at all. How this place has been open for twenty-plus years escapes me.  It honestly does.  How did I wind up there? Well, I do have some kind of genetic memory that the place is a shit-hole and should be avoided at all costs. But what can I say? My curiosity got the best of me. Now I know for sure that the place is a shit-hole. Mystery solved.  What kind of playing card did I get?  Ace of Hearts. No lie.

      Today, my mom clues me in to the fact that she just had a life insurance policy drawn up for me.  "God forbid anything happen to you," she says.  I think my mother is trying to kill me.  "We'll at least be able to afford to bury you." she says.  I ask if they could just drag me out to the shed behind the house and leave me there. I also felt the need to point out that I would not be in any position to argue.  Did you know that insurance pays off triple if you die on a business trip?  Right now, as I hover near the quarter-century mark, I'm not even sure that I want to be buried. Maybe I want to be cremated and thrown to the winds. Or put in a Folgers can and forgotten about. The point is that I'm not sure.  Should I write up a will? Keep it in my desk drawer? I have to make sure that all of my pornography is properly disposed of prior to my demise...  Still, it was one of those moments where you're confronted by your own mortality and it kind of weirds you out.  The fact that my mom mentioned burying me about a dozen times within 15 minutes didn't help either.

      So...I saw "The Movie."  In summation,  the movie was mostly hype. I'm not saying that it wasn't good...It's just that if you make an ultra-violent movie about the Jesus, you're going to attract your fair share of the curious public.  Mel Gibson is kind of a heavy-handed director, given the subject matter it's kind of hard not to be.  I was also surprised by the number of kids at this movie. They were everywhere. Nothing like putting the fear of God back into the children.  There was also the fair share of people that  should  have the fear of God put back into them. All the time with the talking...and the cringing...and the gagging.  I think Gors put it best when saying that the movie should have ended with this:  THE END. NOW GET YER ASS TO CHURCH!

      It was kind of a drag being stuck at my desk today.  Today would have been a good day to sleep late, go to the library/book store and maybe take in a movie.  Or watch the entire Star Wars trilogy in my underwear. One of those two things. They're interchangeable. Really.  For some odd reason I don't find rainy days to be depressing. I've got nothing against a sunny spring day, that's why John Rayban invented sunglasses. But, given a choice between the two, I'd pick the overcast day 9 times out of 10.  I guess this means I'm destined to move to the Pacific Northwest.  Current mood: Steady as she goes... Current music: In Time: The Best of R.E.M.  P.S. This has got to be one of the gayest, live journal-esque posts I've ever done.  If you're not sorry you read this, you should be.

      That's right, I've got may bag packed and I'm heading to the Windy City for the next four days.  I know little other than that I get to wear a tux and that I'll be a drunken mess for 3/4 of the time I'm there. 1/2 of the 1/4 is reserved for sleeping which, roughly translated, is the flight to and from the city.  Deep breath and....  I'm out!

      Apparently I missed this morning's meeting at work.  I'm sure it would have helped if I had been  told  about it. As it turns out I was the only person left off the e-mail list...so I did have a legitimate reason for missing it.  Oh the sweet taste of vindication.  So now, I get an hour away from my desk, after lunch, for the catch up meeting. That'll be nice since I'm pissing away my lunch hour to go home and finish packing.  I stayed up way to late last night screwing around with my suitcase which caused me to over-sleep this morning. Guess I would have missed that meeting anyway, huh?

      Last night I had one weird-ass dream. I was even debating about putting it to paper it was so damn weird.  The Cliff's Notes version is this... The world was being invaded by aliens and it was Christmas time. Seems pretty bland when I actually write it down but it was enough to wake me out of a sound sleep.  Maybe I should lay off the Sci-Fi for awhile.

      It is with the deepest sorrow that I must announce the passing of the Black Penis (aka Rocket_Number3). The website is gone but his antics will live forever in the hearts and minds of teenage girls everywhere.  Although, I wouldn't be surprised if the B.P. popped up again... You can't stop the Black Penis. You can only hope to contain it.

      This morning I was at the bank making a withdrawal from my checking account. Fascinating, I know. After saying as much to the teller she asked:  "Checking or savings?"  Maybe she didn't hear me the first time. It's happened to me before, so I says:  "Checking."  "Well, just make sure to note it in your check book. You don't want to bounce any checks."  I didn't know what to say. I had plenty of money in my account. Did she know something I didn't?   After the initial feeling of "wha?" passed I felt like telling her to get fucked. Who was she to tell me how to manage my finances? Is there a 'busy body' alert that comes up on the screen when the account dips below a certain amount?  Besides, it's payday tomorrow.  This is also why I do most of my banking on-line.

      When I wrote that last entry I think my brain was still shrunken from the night before. Not to tear down that entry or anything. That's about the most accurate representation of the night in question.  I'm sure I could have waxed poetic about Detroit's Eastern Market for a couple additional paragraphs. However, the desire to get the drunken truth out far outweighed sentiment.  After I saw Kill Bill Vol. 2 I was able to go for a nice long ride. Put the car windows down and everything. Did a lot of thinking too.  That's right...thinking. Not drinking.   ...Assholes.

      If there's one thing I enjoy about life it's that it can always take a turn for the unexpected.  My mission for Saturday night seemed set: Attend an art gallery show, see Motord Bob perform. So it was written. So it should be done.  Also, the word had come down from on high that there was going to be a party of sorts. The message on my voicemail stated this: "Dylan says we should get drunk tonight. Jim Beam drunk."  My plate was rapidly becoming full.  Phase one consisted of me going to the art show and watching the band do their thing. I also learned that I can't afford art. The gallery I went to is located in Detroit's Eastern Market...the last place I would have thought of for an art gallery. That's what made it so intriguing.  From there I shot back to the 'burbs to Dylan's apartment. When I arrived this is how it went:  Me: What up? Gors: Hey, bitch. Dylan: Not much. Living the dream, escaping reality.  From there, we sat on the balcony all the while  being circled by a police helicopter. Clearly, the knew where the night was going before we did.  Then Dylan received a phone call. Then we were in a limo.  One of Dylan's friends is a limo driver. He just happened to be in the area after dropping of a bachelorette party and had some time to kill.  Have you ever taken a limo to the liquor store? I have.  Being in the limo was cool and the gang, but it did have its drawbacks. First and foremost, it smelled like hot ass. Not "hot ass" in the sense that "wow, she has a hot ass." It was more along the lines of "I got soaked on Splash Mountain and I've been walking around a theme park, stewing in my own juices, all day" hot ass.  From there the limo took us to the bar. It's always a good idea to go to a bar where your friends know the waitress. I seem to recall getting shots with out asking for them. That's about it.  From there the waitress took us to a house party. There was a skateboard ramp in the basement. The basement had low ceilings and I smacked my head on one of the cross beams. I later admitted to feeling a bit concussed.  eventually, I wound up at home. When I arrived, I seriously thought about sleeping on the front lawn. It was that nice. Then I realized that the sun would be up in a matter of minutes, went inside and passed out. What a night.  There are bits an pieces of the story I'm leaving out for time's sake... It's the details that are going to make up the bulk of the comic/novel/play I may or may not write one day. So why bother to put them down in writing now?  Next: Sunday (or "The flip side of the coin")

      I don't know why, but April has been a busy month for me. I'm constantly on the move from one event to the next. I've even started hitting "snooze" on my alarm clock...and that's something I never do.  What an existence! I'm so "busy" that I don't have time for introspection anymore. I suppose that's a good thing. Too much thinking will drive you nuts.  Next stop on my tour is the Majestic Theater. I'm going to see the  urlLink Electric Six  tonight. Danger!

      I went out on Friday night...with people I work with. I'm sure that anyone who's reading this will attest to the fact that I am not a very social person. What I am, however, is an alcoholic. And so it was with the promise of a free beer that I ventured to a bowling alley.  It was a bowling alley that I had been to before with some of my more rowdy friends, making the events that were to transpire that evening all the more surprising.  When I got there it was about 8:30 p.m. and some of my co-workers had been there since six. It was understood that I had a bit of catching up to do. With my free beer in hand I proceed to participate in a activity called "mingling."  Oh, how I mingled. Drinking my domestic beer and dispensing with the wry comments as I am want to do. Then this happened:  "Shhhey...You aren't BO-ling."  "I'm sorry. That's really not for me."  "C'mon! We'll be a team."  "I don't like bowling. I like drinking."  "Yer shy, aren't you?"  "No, it's just that I can't bowl. I have pins in my wrist." (It was either that or say that I was 'limp wristed.' I didn't want to seem any more ambiguous.)  "Give me your shoe. What size do you take?!?"  "I don't know. I won't. I didn't. I can't. Wooden leg. Wooden leg!"  So I was off the hook. Shortly after that we were thrown out of the bowling alley. Mind you, it wasn't just a bunch of rowdy interns and contract employees. My boss, the person in charge of my entire department was leading the charge. She was upset because I wouldn't do a shot. Did I mention she's supposed to be retiring next year? I think I feel emasculated.  The end result of the evening was that I met a bunch of people I had yet to meet. Why, I'm even supposed to be having lunch with a couple of department heads tomorrow. I'm also rather pleased that I only had to pay for 1/5 of the beers that I drank.  I think that the following quote best sums up the night:  "Y'know, man, you're alright. I don't mind it when you come down to my desk... you're alright. We should hang out more often."  Meeting people is easy.

      Unlike most of the other nonfoolish holidays, the history of April Fool's Day, sometimes called All Fool's Day, is not totally clear. There really wasn't a "first April Fool's Day" that can be pinpointed on the calendar. Some believe it sort of evolved simultaneously in several cultures at the same time, from celebrations involving the first day of spring.   The closest point in time that can be identified as the beginning of this tradition was in 1582, in France. Prior to that year, the new year was celebrated for eight days, beginning on March 25. The celebration culminated on April 1. With the reform of the calendar under Charles IX, the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, and New Year's Day was moved to January 1.   However, communications being what they were in the days when news traveled by foot, many people did not receive the news for several years. Others, the more obstinate crowd, refused to accept the new calendar and continued to celebrate the new year on April 1. These backward folk were labeled as "fools" by the general populace. They were subject to some ridicule, and were often sent on "fools errands" or were made the butt of other practical jokes.   This harassment evolved, over time, into a tradition of prank-playing on the first day of April. The tradition eventually spread to England and Scotland in the eighteenth century. It was later introduced to the American colonies of both the English and French. April Fool's Day thus developed into an international fun fest, so to speak, with different nationalities specializing in their own brand of humor at the expense of their friends and families.   If you believe I wrote that....APRIL FOOLS!  No, seriously....it's all true.

Optimus Prime (the action figure) and I are going to have a wonderful commitment ceremony in Hawaii this summer. Of course, you're all invited.  urlLink Villa  is even going to be our ring bearer.

I can't speak for myself today Cause the love that I know Is only good for one roll in the hay Love was never in the limelight Love couldn't last through the night Cause the that I've known Is always casting out the first stone  And if I ever live it down I might be surprised I wish you just knew it I wish you just knew it I wish you just knew your Uno   urlLink Clicky

      Man, it's nice outside today.  It's the kind of day made for staying inside and hiding from the sun. Now, that's exactly what I'm doing today at work but it's not how I ideally would have executed it. Video games are frowned upon by my higher-ups.  Four more hours. Maybe I'll go for a bike ride when I get home and then the gym after that. Maybe I'll catch up on my DVD watching (they're starting to pile up). Maybe I'll write the great American novel and sell the movie rights to Miramax.  Maybe I'll crack open my journal and put pen to paper for the first time in weeks.  Maybe it's time I get back to work.

      Got back to Michigan last night. Went back to work today.  The first part I'm okay with, the second part not so much. My vacations are fun but they never seem to last long enough. It always seems like I end up needing a vacation to recover from my vacation.  Still, I do get a shortened work week....which I think is pretty boss. The city of Chicago always seems to give me a little creative kick in the pants, too. I've got some ideas that I need to get out on paper before the week is out.  Back to the grind.  p.s.

      Ooooh, spooky. Just saw the title of E's last post. Maybe I'm psychic. Or just psycho. It's really all up to you to decide.  It has been decided by Mighty Lord Playstationicus that I shall never again be allowed to leave my apartment. And if by chance, I defy the Mighty Lord Playstationicus, the Slightly Lesser But No Less Mighty Civilization Threebus will smite me back into the chair, bitch. Seriously. I got the  urlLink EyeToy  thingy, and it's got this game called "Groove" which is similar to DanceDance Revolution (Which whenever I see it, I'm too terrified to try it out. I can just see all the gothbois laughing when I screw up, and my fragile ego just wouldn't be able to take it. The thing that makes Groove different is that instead of just stomping on a pad, you're actually ON THE TV. There's a little camera that is live feeding your dance moves onto the screen. You've got to hit all of these targets in time with the music. Now that I think about it, it's a lot like  urlLink Amplitude  or  urlLink Frequency , in concept, only your hitting the targets with your hands instead of pressing the buttons. And this game? Massively, massively addicting. Like the first night I got it I spent three hours playing. Seriously. I gots problems.  And Civ3? Yeah, I picked up the expansion pack to that for  my husband. Apparently, it's got a two player mode. He says, "Y'know, if you ever want to learn to play this, do the tutorial or whatever, it'd be really cool to play the twoplayer game." And me? I'm all giddy like a school girl. Really? Me? You want to play with me?! In all of three seconds I've gone from Civ3 widow to... I don't know what. A bigger geek than before? Is that even possible? I'd like to think I've not plateaued on the geek scale. That would be frightening.  So, yeah. Clearly psycho.

      As of late, I've noticed a glut of comedy/talk shows that start with a name and end with some kind of bizarre adjective (i.e. "Jamie Kennedy Experiment," "John Henson Project," and the "Graham Norton Effect.")  Near as I can figure, none of these are experiments, projects or effects. Unless the goal of these three quantifiers is to piss people off...they're a rousing failure.  Still, I could not help but imagine what I would do if I had shows of the same name...  "The E.A. Henson Experiment" This one should be good because the experiment in question centers around something I read in a comic book.  Why is it that toast, when dropped, always lands butter side down? Why do cats always land on their feet? If a piece of buttered toast is tied or otherwise bound to the top of a cat, would this not be a cheap and efficient form of anti-gravity?  Think of it... vast fleets of starships powered by tabbies with buttered slices of Wonder Bread strapped to their backs. It could work.  "The E.A. Henson Project" The way I see this one is kind of a "year-in-the-life-of" type thing. I apologize for phrasing it as such, but I hear that's the way they do it in Hollywood. How else can you explain the new Hillary Duff movie? "It's like Cinderella...but with a cell phone." Who funds this shit?  Anyways, it'd be some of the standard reality show pabulum where I have cameras follow me around. The whole show would consist of me working a dead-end job, acting immature and otherwise avoiding adulthood.  "The E.A. Henson Effect" This one I still have on the drawing board. What I envision is basically the effect I have on people. How do people react when they have a little E.A. Henson up in their mix? The answer may not surprise you.  The answer is: basically the same. Being a cipher people pretty much go on about their daily activities when I'm around. They always say that "it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for." Not so. I'm really not looking to disturb anyone else's shit.  The real meat of the show would come from when I get to know somebody on a personal level. Then the fun starts. It ranges from me being weird to the point that they think I'm retarded to me being quiet to the point they think I'm retarded. That and me driving people away. Always with the driving people away.  The show would be a nice little romp through my brain and to the outside world. I'm thinking Discovery channel. Like one of those "Tourette's" specials, only more swearing and twitching.  I think that all of these would work. Think about the shows that are really on the air. Are these any worse?

      It's just now occurred to me that I sit next to the Xerox machine at work. What a perfect excuse to dust off that hackneyed SNL character portrayed by Rob ("I'm in every Adam Sandler movie")Schneider.  It's pretty easy. I just take someone's name and add "-inator" to it and follow-up with "a-lama-ding-dong." For example, "Craiginator! Craig-a-lama-ding-dong."  Of course all these are followed by a "Shut up, Eric." Or "We all hate you. Know this."  I never said it was easy being me. However, at times, it is fun.

      I had a weird dream last night. As I've discussed in previous postings I believe that dreams can mean something. Dissect this one as you will...  I was out and about one day and had gone to the store. When I came out of the store my car, surrounded by a crowd of people, had four flat tires. If they weren't totally flat, they were almost there. What was I to do? For some reason my friend was there and offered to take my care to the tire store (where else?). I sat on the curb and waited for my car to come back.  Run with it!

      The Christian rock band Creed has broken up. Praise Him!  We will no longer have to be subjected to shitty god rock and songs about Scott Stapp's illegitimate son. Can I get a witness?  I'm sure we haven't seen the last of them... But, small victories and all that.  All this and Ronald Reagan died too! I just wish he'd take the Reaganites with him.  As Gors so eloquently put it: "Well, the old cocksucker couldn't hang on forever!"  When I presented my dad with this information, he came to the same conclusion I did: "Creed broke up because Reagan died?"  Close enough, dad. Close enough.

       Oh, man... I'm starting to experience "compressed time." Every day seems the same as the last, I don't know if I'm coming or going...everything seems like a copy of a copy of a copy.     &nbsp;   Part of this resulted in me not signing my time sheet this week. No signed time sheet equals no paycheck. No paycheck equals a trip to the blood bank. At least they'll feed me there.     &nbsp;   That, and other random weird stuff. I can't remember what days things happened or what conversations I had with people. The phrases "did I talk to you about this?" and "I said what?" are becoming more and more common.     &nbsp;   Monday thru Friday is a blur, punctuated only by my alarm clock and the noise my head makes hitting the pillow.     &nbsp;   Then there are the weekends. Sleeping in and wasting time. I don't feel like I'm doing anything with my life and the weekends only seem to magnify that feeling. It's a vicious circle I'm going in, I work all week and with my free time I don't feel like working on what makes me happy.     &nbsp;   It's like when people say they need a vacation from their vacation.     &nbsp;   In other news, I was offered a sideways promotion this week. The word promotion is usually associated with good things, but this gave me pause. Being moved to a different department to "better utilize my unique talents" gives a sense of permanence to my job. The like me enough to keep me around, eventually pick up my contract and set up a 401k.     &nbsp;   I'm too young to be thinking about the rest of my life. &nbsp;&nbsp;

      okay here's some pics from friday.&nbsp; next time i'll be sure to try and move around the room a bit more for better angles.&nbsp; the place was kind of packed in the front so it was a bit difficult.&nbsp; also having 2 beers at a time didn't help.&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe a little less black and white also.                                       &nbsp;

       urlLink Pretty please ?     Jason is a writer and performer friend of mine who is putting together a tour of the UK. Let us let him explain:       Every October I visit a different country for a month, doing poetry shows and writing down my experiences in my journal. The next spring I then collect the journal entries and photos from the trip and publish them as a full-length tour book. (Last year's tour was of Germany;  urlLink click here  to read that book online.) The way I finance these trips is to pre-sell the tour book directly to readers, and then send them a copy of the book after the tour is over. I also accept out-and-out donations, corporate sponsorships, and donations of goods and services.     Donate. You need the good karma.      Donate. It'd be really nice of you.

       This post was written from E's bunker five miles beneath the surface of the Earth...    My website comes equiped with this nifty little SiteTracker thing that tells me who (Domain name)&nbsp;has been looking at my site and how they got there. Here. I mean....forget it.   Now, while I was browsing today's report I noticed that one of the domain names was of the USMC. Now, I don't know what else that could stand for, other than the obvious, but I do now know that the military-industrial complex is out to get me.   They've realized that the statute of limitations is up on any kind of legal action that could be taken and now they're out for blood. Or is it oil? I can't remember what the liberal media keeps telling me...   For now, I'm going to remove myself from the public eye (even more than I already have) and wait for this to blow over. I stocked my secret bunker with Softbatch cookies and Gin...enough for me to live out the rest of my days. Which, on that diet, should be about a month.   I've already sold the movie, T.V. and book rights to Miramax. It will be the most thrilling tale of nudeness, junk food and drunkenness since  Jayne Eyre.   Panic attack!

      Why, that's how I came up with that title.&nbsp; I owe everything to not sleeping.  &nbsp;  Willpower. Some people have it and some don't. Actually, you can replace "willpower" with just about anything and that statement remains true. But for the purposes of this post I'll just stick with keeping things black and white.  &nbsp;  Have you ever been completely committed to anything? Idea or otherwise? What keeps you going?  &nbsp;  Quitting smoking. Saving cash. Not changing. Not picking up the phone. Be a better human being. There are any number of reasons that keep people going.&nbsp; What is yours?  &nbsp;  Force of will. Either committing to doing something or keeping from doing something. A battle of wills against yourself! I wonder why more people don't have split personalities? I suppose it can be justified as being "good" for yourself.  &nbsp;  I was never exactly sure where I was going with this.&nbsp; Just something I'd been thinking about.

      So...  I'm sitting on the couch last night, contemplating the wasted wreck of my life and I get a phone call.  A call? Me? You know I'm going to answer.  Why, it's noneother than "Your Standard Jerk" occasional contributor to this here site.  "Dude, I've gotta question for you: What was the name of the plant in " Little Shop of Horrors ?"  "Audrey. Audrey II, actually."  "Ha! Eat it, fuckers!"  "...I'm sorry?"  "We had a bet. I won. Thanks, man."  Now, the thing that interests me about the previous exchange is the conversation leading up to the phone call. There must have been nothing good on TV. Never in a million years would I have expected that phone call.  But I'm sure there was no doubt in Y.S.J's mind that I would know the answer to that question. This isn't the first time I've been called on to answer some obscure question.  Am I forever cursed to be the guy that knows everything about pointless shit?  "What was the flower shop owner's name?"  That'd be Mr. Mushnik...fuck.

      I rolled in this morning at exactly 5:10 a.m.  Screaming east down M-59 I watched the sky turn from a deep indigo to a hazy pink. Just me and my car trying to make it to bed before the sun came up. I had solidly split my time between trying to stay awake and pointless introspection.  Let me tell you, being alone in a car (in the dark)is quite conducive to psychological self-examination.  Anyways, back to the previous six hours.  How did I spend my evening? Drinking? No (well, maybe a little bit). Debauchery? Hardly. Drugs? Never.  I spent the evening being cross-examined by two of my best friends and re-hashing recent events in my life. Neither of these things are particularly therapeutic nor helpful.  Nobody knows how to turn the screws like your friends.  Of course this only took up a fair portion of the night. But what we spoke of brewed in the back of my mind (like it wasn't brewing before this) until the long car ride home.  Once again, I made it home in one piece. The birds had already started singing and night was slowly giving way to day. I got in bed ready to sleep but unable to. I tossed and turned for awhile and eventually I fell asleep...  ...Only to be awakened by my asshole neighbor mowing his lawn three hours later.

      That's right it's day number 9,125. 219,000 hours, 13,140,000 minutes and 788,400,000 seconds...and I feel every bit of it.   I'm 25 today.   Half way to fifty. One quarter of a century.  There's no denying it, I am solidly in my mid-twenties. A milestone, I'm told. So am I supposed to grow up now?  I'm not one to freak out about getting older...I'm just growing into my "old soul." I guess I'm just a perpetual optimist, this year will be better than the last year. Or maybe I'm just in perpetual denial.  The headline of this post reminds me of a song I once heard from a musical I've never seen. Maybe I'll take in some culture this year. Maybe I'll finish writing that play this year. Maybe I've grown out of procrastinating.  Maybe, maybe, maybe.  Who wants a spanking?  I still don't know where I'm going, but I can't help but look forward to the future.  The immediate future includes a trip to my favorite pub tonight. I have it on good authority that beer does not taste as good anywhere else. I tend to agree.  The far future is hard to define, always is. Here's a prediction: Minor/major victories, crushing defeats, laughter, love, loss, family, friends and all the other cliche bullshit. You know why things become cliche, don't you?  Because they're true.  That's life.  ....and I feel every bit of it.

       This morning, my group leader put this quote on the on the dry erase board: "Only you can prevent forest fires. -Smokey the Bear."  These messages are usually intended to be motivating or uplifting, my GL decided to buck the trend by being wonderfully irreverent. Playful satire aside, he was ultimately wrong.  Pop quiz: True or false? Smokey the Bear is his correct name.  Answer: False. Here's why...    "In 1952 Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins wrote the anthem that would cause a debate among Smokey enthusiasts for the next several decades. In order to maintain the correct rhythm, the writers added a "the" between "Smokey" and "Bear." As testament to the song's popularity, Smokey Bear became known as "Smokey The Bear" to many adoring fans, but in actuality his name never changed, and he is still known correctly as Smokey Bear." (from the   urlLink  official site   )     Again, I must ask why I know this shit.

       1) Don't have a keg at your house warming party.      2) Incoherent drunks can provide hours of entertainment for both you and your friends.      3) Said keg would be considered "common source" alcohol. Making the people supplying it the responsible parties. That makes it easier for said incoherent drunk to deny responsibility for his actions!
