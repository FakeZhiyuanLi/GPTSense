      Leaving for a bit of a vacation tomorrow. Going to D.C. area. Have a layover at  urlLink O'hare  which I just found out was a  huge  airport. I printed out a map of the terminal that should help me out. I will be going to  urlLink Playa del Fuego  while I am there and also  urlLink Aquarium  in Baltimore. I am also going to see  urlLink Reverend Horton Heat  . I have never seen them play.

      Ok well. Posting this so I can actually have a real first post. I am still working on the aesthetic of the page. Basically this will just be something of a learning tool for me. An experiment sort of.  Right now I am listening to the   urlLink Gunslinger Girl    OST which a friend of mine in Japan sent me. He also sent me some ep but have not gotten around to looking at them. It is not out in the U.S though and if I am not mistaken the only thing available is fansubs. Story does seem interesting.

      Well it&nbsp;looks like I am not doing to well a job of keeping this updated. I suppose my only consultation is that no one comes here so I don't feel so bad.  &nbsp;  I believe that one of the reasons that I am not updating as much is that I am not normally online in the summer. I end up reading.....a lot. I'm not reading Angels &amp; Demons anymore, but have gone on a rash of reading *gasp* girly books.&nbsp; I am not going to name any because I feel a bit embarrassed. I don't normally read girly books. I pride myself on not being girly so to concede and do something that is hard for me to swallow. I am stubborn.  &nbsp;  Now on to more interesting things.     A  urlLink friend  of mine sent me  urlLink this . I am fan of  urlLink Warren  and his weirdness.  One of my favorite sites  urlLink Red vs Blue  has just wrapped up season two and will soon be sending out the DVD's. They say the end of July is when it will be shipped out, but with will all the critiquing they did of the season one DVD, I do not expect Season two it until middle August. Still, I will be overjoyed when I do get it.   Don't ask me how I found  urlLink this  site, but if you have heard the  urlLink SoBe  commercials you will understand.

      hmmm. Well, what to catch up on.  Having a co-worker whip me up a new machine. He is going to keep a couple of things from the old one, but here is the new stuff I am getting.  40 Gig IDE UDMA ATA/100 WD 7200 RPM 8MG 256 Meg PC3200 DDR 400 52x CD-ROM  Gigabyte 7N400-L Motherboard/AMD 2500XP Retail Box 256 Meg AGP DDR FX 5700  My friend dropped my monitor that I have and I am pretty sure it is DOA. So I think I am going to get a flat screen. Kinda interested in this  urlLink Samsung . Nothing super crazy.  I just got a  urlLink gmail  account. Have not looked at what all is neat about it yet.
