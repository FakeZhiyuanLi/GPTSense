      Before I ever even got my camera, I was a big fan of long-exposure photography. As a frequent visitor of  urlLink DeviantArt , I was exposed to a lot of different photographic styles. Long-exposures of cars at night ranked among my favorites. Once I got my camera, I absolutely had to try my hand at them.   urlLink     This is the first long-exposure shot I took that I felt was good enough to keep. On my way home from the mall one night I pulled out my camera and shot about 20 frames of cars passing by a plethora of locations. This was before I got a tripod, so I was resting the camera on concrete barriers, the ground, anything I could find that was more stable than my own two hands.   For this particular shot I set up the camera on a metal pole (the ones that are about 4' tall - I don't know what they're called) at the side of a quieter-than-most-Hong-Kong-roads road, set the shutter for 5 seconds and waited for a car to come by.  Car! Click.  I was immensely happy when I saw the shot - it turned out far better than I expected. The blue headlight streak is, I think, way cooler than the standard yellow/orange color. Also, the blurriness of the leaves (it was pretty windy) add an almost surreal characteristic to the image.  Since I was basically a complete novice of a photographer at that time, I hadn't anticipated the streetlamps to come out so strongly, and especially not in the awesome star-patterns that they did. The brightest lamp really keeps the left side of the shot from being too dull.

      During the summer, my family and I went to visit my mum's aunt and uncle, who live on a farm.  Leopard Skin  is one of the shots I got there, and one of my favorites from my collection.    urlLink

      While I was staying with my aunt and uncle in Minnesota this summer, I spent a lot of time with their dogs. A few days before I left, I decided I'd do some portraits of the dogs and get prints to give to my aunt and uncle as thank-you for-letting-me-stay gifts. Here's what I got:   urlLink      Sphinx  is a photo of Boston in a very typical pose. She always sits on top of that couch, and wags her tail like mad whenever someone's in the room. To get a good, sharp image I cut her tail out of the frame and use a very fast shutter, to reduce blur - it still took about 5 shots to get a sharp enough one.   urlLink     This one,  Boredom Sets In , is my favorite of the two portraits. Pugsley, as she's called, turned out to be a very uncooperative subject. Whenever I put my finger on the shutter-release button she seemed to deliberately look away - at the wall, the ceiling, anything other than in a direction that would work for me. I ended up putting my finger on the button, waiting for her to settle into a typical, adorable pose and then holding out my left arm, snapping my fingers to get her to look where I wanted while taking the image. I think the time spent was worth it, as my aunt and uncle were extremely happy with the photos.

      Well, this is my first entry, so I picked one of my most recent photos to start this phlog off. Comments are welcome and encouraged on all entries, especially if you can constructively criticise them.   urlLink     This photo was an experimental shot for me. My grandma has a bookcase containing an entire encyclopedia at the top of a very dark flight of stairs. I noticed them for their uniformity, and started shooting them. Since it was so dark, I was leaving the shutter open for 5 seconds per shot. I was inspired by a Jim Brandenburg photo, and decided to pull the book out slightly, open the shutter and stick my hand into the frame halfway through, being careful not to move the book (which was rather precariously positioned) and trying to control the shaking of my hand (curse you, caffeine!) to produce a sharp shot. I love how it turned out.
