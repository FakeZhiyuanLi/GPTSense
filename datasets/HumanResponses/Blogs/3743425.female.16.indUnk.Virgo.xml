       Who needs 'em? Right?  Well, that's a big no for me. I desperately need summer vacations to cool or seemingly boring places. These trips rescue me from my very work loaded school year; which lasts from August to June! So far I have been to Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, and Pensacola , Florida. Not many places but I have some great memories from 'em. Like in Pensacola, my sister's friend Emily came. She helped me plan a guy approach, to some guy I had never met even tho he was super hott (with many more t's I just can't fit that many on one page)! So, if you have some funny summer stories, share them wit me, k?!!! Don't leave me hangin'! Bye.

           Passport  is a summer camp for  one week in one of these four states: Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida, or Missouri. I have been going for 3 years now, and it is so much fun! Each day we have breakfast, morning devotion, morning celebration, bible study, mission projects/lunch, free time, supper, evening worship, and a party! The mission projects are divided up among each bible study group as: painting/cleaning, yard work, working with children, abused children/adult centers.       This year I worked with Amanda Hambrick's bible study group on Week 1 of camp. We went to an old church that was converted to a day camp for children ages 5-16 from all over the world. (Mostly underprivileged or adopted children). The camp was called "Americana", and is a non-profit organization. The camp provides each child with a nutritious lunch, daily field trips, a library, art room, music room, gym, and playground!       There were seventeen people in my bible study group, including me. Their names were: Chelsea Jackson, Michael, Chris Haney, Kaitlyn Wille, Chelsea W., Cole Phillips, Ben Shippey, Kim Canady, Becca Furr, Melissa, Amy, Jessica Kimberlin, Rachel, Christina (Tina), Josh Balsom, Kevin, and me. I loved getting to  know all of these people with their fun and unique personalities. Especially "The Chelseas", and all of the funny and kind things we said to each other. Remember when we three sang Grease songs together when we were scrubbing windows, guys? That was so fun.       Well, now you all know something about my summer that I do every year. This is the only trip I plan ahead for each summer. And anyone can go on Passport with any church that goes, as long as you are in 7th grade to 12th grade, you are eligible! So find out now what churches near your area are going to Passport Mission Camp, and I encourage you to sign up!

      I am posting this segment because a lot of times people (including me) ask crazy, odd, and sometimes down right silly questions. SO...think, please, next time you ask someone a question. For instance, in court, do not ask the judge or anyone else around you to define simple words like, "Could you please define the word 'where'." Come ON! When the attorney approaches you in the witness stand and asks, "Where were you on the night of July 12th, 1999?" Do NOT say 'could you please define the word 'where'.' okay? Anywayz, so back to my original statement. Maybe these pointers will help me and others to think before asking a question. Thanks, and "I'm outie".
