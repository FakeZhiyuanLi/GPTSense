      So, I had two topics I was considering for today's entry.  A lengthy discussion on contemporary labor relationships and the status of capitalism, or my trip to the  urlLink Museum of Science!   Don't worry, its the latter.  Spent the morning at Boston's Museum of Science.  I get in free because I work for a non-profit cultural institution.  Yay me!  I wanted to get there today because they were having an exhibit closing this week that I haven't been able to see called "Speed".  It was very hands-on and kids-oriented, so it wasn't really as fun as I'd hoped, but probably would have been nice for kids in groups.  Some of it was interesting, though.  Had a little thing that let you do your own animation, which was cool.  On my way there, I walked through an exhibit on  urlLink Microbes, sponsored by Pfizer.   I'm not going to be too hard on the Museum because this was very clearly labeled on the sign that introduces the exhibit (although its not on their website), BUT the exhibit had some pretty obnoxious corporate shilling.  Its a traveling exhibit thats a few years old at this point, but it reminds me about why corporate sponsorship is dangerous in education/museum.  The way it was set up, I was left with the impression the Pfizer single-handedly won World War II.  Okay, I'm exaggerating (slightly) but it heavily tied Pfizer to the discovery of penicillin in a manner which wasn't entirely historically accurate.  I imagine if I sat through the whole video display, it'd have been more clear, but it was definetly misleading.  (Pfizer didn't discover penicillin; it also didn't discover the original research which discovered penicillin;  it was just tapped to aid in production once it became clear that a drug from penicillin had considerable potential)  But aside from creepy corporate influences, the exhibit had an infant-sized iron lung which reminded me how damn scary Polio must have been and how incredibly thankful I am to live in a world where fat people qualify as a major health concern.  It may be wrong, but at least they only got to hassling us because they cured stuff that was really frightening.  Just the thought of people trapped in Iron Lungs for the rest of their lives was shocking.  We all owe much thanks to Jonas Salk, and should be thankful of where we live, because  urlLink Polio hasn't yet been eradicated.   Anyway, one more thing on the exhibit I want to comment on.  They had a game/exhibit called "Race a Bug" which was a badly designed 3D racing game involving microbes going through a human body.  There was an on-going naration in the game (which lasted WAY too long) and it kept fitting in these fat-baiting remarks.  I mean, its a freaking game, and it keeps saying how the body in the game needs to lose weight.  Yuck!  So, after learning how Polio saved the planet, I went into an IMAX film,  Top Speed  which was basically about people and things that go fast.  A lot of it was a love-fest for athletes, which kinda annoyed me, since in the details were bits about how horribly dangerous these sports are and produces numerous injuries even for a good athlete.  This is what we have to aspire to?  Putting our bodies in unnecessary danger for the persuit of health?  We're not talking aerobics or anything here, but mountain biking and 24-hour road races.  It was scary just watching the mountain bikes as they hoped along some picturesque rocky desert-type terrain.  No thanks.  I'm not nearly that enamored with the thrill of cheating death.  I'm much happy playing fair with death as opposed to tempting it.  So, those are my pointless thoughts of the day.  I'll consider subjecting you all to my diatribe about labor relations some other day.  Oh, and  Good Will Hunting  is on Bravo now.  I take back anything positive I said about Ben Affleck's performance.  It was much more of an absurd chararicture than I gave him credit for.  Big props to Gus Van Sant for the directing, though.  I love the atmosphere he creates in the film.  Its all very real.  Except for Affleck.  I'm loving the ambient noise in the Harvard Square scene with Matt Damon and Minnie Driver.  Everything about the film grounds in reality, which is so important for a story of someone with unreal abilities.  Except for Affleck.  Though, to be fair, Affleck was good in the final scene, but that's only because he has to act with his mouth shut so he doesn't get to ruin things.

      So, I was on  urlLink IMDB  looking up celebrities born the same year as my girlfriend as she's about to have a birthday and is anxious about her age.  I thought I could logically reason out of this by pointing out hip, young celebs who are the same age as her.  I keep noticing it in recent months, so I figure I would sit down and come up with names.  Found some good ones, too, but naturally, this isn't the kind of thing you can argue against as age is such a screwed up concept in our society.  I did manage to make myself feel young, though, when I checked out my own  urlLink birth year.   It seems I was born in the same year as such luminaries as Ashton Kutchner.  (shudder)  Also Joshua Jackson, Countess Vaughn, the guy who played Jake Sisko on DS9, Sisqo, Josh Hartnett, plus size model Mia Tyler, Ethan Embry, second best comic actor of his generation, Topher Grace, and the best comic actor of his generation, Jason Biggs.  Not like any of them make me feel old, (although Embry and Hartnett have both played homicide detectives) but man does Ashton Kutchner make me feel young.  I mean, he's the epitome of horribly immature actors.  Oh, well.  Anyway, if I want to feel old I just need to watch MTV and realize that I'm no longer in the young demographic they are going for.

      After the somber nature of my last two posts, I wanted to post something a little more frivelous for the weekend.  So, lets discuss Martha Stewart's pillows.  And no, that is not some kind of play on words.  I litterally mean her pillows, available at K-Mart.  I bought a pair of them a while back.  I was less that satisfied with my pillows, and I felt I needed another set, anyway, to complete my bed.  So, her's were on sale and they looked quite comfy so I picked them up.  They are quite comfy, but they get horribly misshapen at the drop of a hat.  They rarely resemble pillows in any meaningful sense, and I can't get them back into any normal form.  Its really annoying.  Especially since my old pillows were so dependable at keeping their form.  Oh, well.  What do I expect when I get Pillows from someone who committed Securties Fraud.

      One of the reasons I was prompted to write about Victor Salva is what has been going on here in Massachusetts with the death of  urlLink John Geoghan.   He was serving a sentence of 10 years for a lot less than Salva served 15 months for, though, in fairness, Geoghan was suspected to have done much, much worse than Salva did.  His death has brought no comfort to his victims.  They understand that this is not justice served.  They wanted Geoghan to serve his sentence and face further justice for his crimes.  Which reminded me of how serving time often gets devalued by death penalty advocates.  In my book, rotting in prison has to qualify as more punative than a quick end to one's life.  Why have we gotten into this mindset of thinking prisoners have it easy?  Since when is prison life fun?  We underestimate the value of freedom and liberty when we suggest that life in prison is not a harsh sentence.  The death penalty is a tough issue for me.  I think the notion of it as a deterrant is a joke.  The death penalty is applied so inconsistantly, that it'd be silly to think it has any use at discouraging crime.  As a punishment, though, I tend towards having some sympathy to this arguement.  If you take another persons life, it makes sense that you should forfeit your own.  Trouble is, the system is horribly unfair.  The stakes are so high that it demands a system which is beyond reproach.  I think such a system just isn't possible, and that our current system is disturbing far off the mark.  I just can't support it.  I can understand why someone would think it is a fair punishment, but it just isn't applied in a fair manner.  I have a special understanding of how unfair the justice system can be.  An uncle of mine was wrongly convicted of murder back in the 80's.  The prosecutors and police withheld evidence.  He was able to get the conviction overturned and was never retried, but it ruined his life.  This stuff happens, and we cannot let this stuff happen with someone's life at stake.  That's why we just cannot trust the death penalty.  The stakes are too high.  We can correct an error when we jail someone.  We cannot take back a lethal injection.  Hopefully, I'll get back to less serious topics, but I wanted to get this out.  Thanks for putting up with me.

      Okay, I'll get back to real issues later tonight, but for now, I want to make a plea to my readers.  Do NOT see  Jeepers Creepers 2  this weekend.  Its director, Victor Salva, does not deserve your money.  Why?  Because he is a convicted child molestor.  Moreover, he coersed his 12-year old victim from a movie he was directing.  Especially disturbing is the fact that the film was recently released on DVD.  That is, the film that served as a method for him sexually assaulting a young boy is still making money for Salva and MGM.  The production company, run by Francis Ford Copella, actually sued the VICTIM when his mother pulled him off the movie when she discovered her son was abused by Salva.  Thankfully, Salva is a moron who FILMED his crimes.  With this evidence, he was able to plea bargain himself a sentance of 15-months.  Now, he cracks jokes and decieves people about the nature of his crime.  He may have done his time, but he's never demonstrated any interest in apologizing for his actions.  He also keeps making movies about children, although studios have at least the intelligence to not let a child on one of his sets again.  I have very little tolerance for child molesters.  It is an act which horrifies me to my core.  Sexual abuse of children is about as unforgivable as it gets, and our society is FAR too leniant against these scum bags.  15 months is not an appropriate sentance for rape, especially with a child victim, ESPECIALLY when you taped the damn thing.  There is nothing we can do about that, now, but that doesn't mean this criminal deserves our money.  I have very little desire to forgive child molestation.  Especially when the scum bag exhibits little or no remorse or desire to rehabilitate.  Especially with what we've seen about the prospects of rehabilitation for child molesters.  Moreover, there should be consequences for such beahvior.  There are plenty of people who who have never forced a 12-year old boy to perform oral sex on them who aren't getting to write and direct movies.  I would say that it would make some sense to put convicted child molestors who used their job in the film industry to procure a victim should go to the back of the line.  I have never seen any of Salva's films.  I'm not going to.  Especially what I have  urlLink read  from those who have seen his work with an understanding that the director is a child molester.   Powder  is said to have strong allusions to an outlook which is textbook for child molesters where they feel alienated and superior to people who don't "understand" their relationships.  The first Jeepers movie, too, has been said to have some creepy moments that had nothing to do with its horror movie pretext, but rather with the real horrors Victor Salva has committed.  Sorry, I know I'm really going off, but this is something that really bothers me and I get reminded with every ad for the film that this scum bag is continuing to get to persue a profession after he used the profession to molest a 12 year old boy.  I just don't think that is right, and I urge you not to give this man any of your hard earned money.  Oh, and as to the comparisons to Roman Polanski and Woody Allen that inevitably get brought up whenever anyone tries to point out Salva's crimes.  First things, first.  Pretty much everyone knows what Allen and Polanski did.  Not everyone knows what Salva did, so it merits discussion so that people who don't want to support child molesters can make the informed decision to stay away.  Next, Allen was accused of child molestation but it was never proven.  What he did with Soon-Yi Previn was bizarre and wrong, and he did a great deal of emotional harm to the children he shared with Mia Farrow by breaking up their marriage in such an indefensible manner.  All very wrong, but also not criminal and certainly not on part with forcing a child to have sex with you.  As to Polanski, I don't want to go to see his films, either.  I went to see  The Pianist  under duress and only because I didn't pay for it.  I've never rented any of his films and I never will.  He raped a young girl, and it was not consentual as some like to pretend, and I still have no tolerance for that.  I'm still upset with myself for going to see  The Pianist  and I doubt I'll ever go to a Polanski film again.  But there is a difference here.  Polanski did not use his job as a director to acquire his victim.  The other difference is that Polanski never paid his debt to society.  He fled.  As many problems as Polanski has experienced in his life, I can't respect that.  BUT, he did go through a LOT in his life.  A lot more than a guy like Salva who caught ever break you could.  Salva wasn't imprisoned by the Nazi's, and didn't have his pregnant wife mudered by Charlie Manson.  It doesn't excuse Polanski's crime or his fugitive status, but it sure makes his case different from Salva.  I also don't believe any of Polanski's films can be interpreted as an justification of child molestation.  But, yeah, I don't want to go see his movies either for the same reason as Salva.

      So, I've finished  Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them  by Al Franken.  I really enjoyed it.  Its clearly a satire, and Franken is at his wittiest, but also frequently genuinely outraged.  A chapter on Paul Wellstone's funeral was especially emotional and a very good demonstration of the way stories get manipulated by the "fair and balanced" press.  This is satire taken seriously, because he understands that these are serious issues.  He makes a solid case in spite of himself.  Also, practically none of the fat jokes that made me uncomfortable with the first book.  They were all in one chapter which I just skipped over, too.  The first book always troubled me because I wasn't entirely sure how much of the endless fat jokes was satire.  I mean, I understood in principle.  He was satirizing the break-down in public discourse precipitated by people like Rush taking cheap shots against a 12-year old Chelsea Clinton.  I don't think Franken really believes the fat jokes are, themselves, justified and proper.  The thing is, I'm not sure he doesn't mean them anyway.  Some comments he made about Chris Farley when he passed away were frustratingly fat hating.  I don't believe he thinks its right to make cheap insults at the expense of fat people, and did it in his first book just to prove a satirical point.  But, I don't think he's at all respectful of fat people on his own, so the satire seemed a little too true.  This reminds me of my unending confusion on how to take Comedy Central's  The Man Show.   On the one hand, it seems so hopelessly over the top that it must be satire.  And there are moments which seem clearly intended to mock men and their habit towards "manliness".  But men have a nasty habit of not getting satires of manliness, and other elements of the shows are viciously reactionary and entirely unredeemable.  Fortunetly, I'm decidedly not their target audience so never watched much anyway, but I'm usually left with the feeling that its half-satire, half-serious, and I'm not sure how to take that.  They have new hosts, now, though, so I'm curious how they are going with it.  Joe Rogan, for instance,  is a mixed bag.  While he sometimes comes off as pretty mean-spirited, he's in the "equal-opportunity hate" kinda vein and has absolutely no tolerance for bigotry.  He's very libertarian-style in his thinking, and I can respect that.  Besides, I liked him on  NewsRadio.   But, I'm guessing it will probably keep to the formula of satire that's too truthful.  But, given how unmotivated I am by giggling and jiggling porn-star types, I think these questions will remain unanswered for me.

      Yeah, that's right.  I mentioned a cat.  Aparently this is a blog rite of passage.  And I just thought it was a kitten leaping on my lap.  hehe  For the record, I am a cat person, but I'm not one to discuss them.  For starters, I don't have a cat.  Nor do I want one.  I'm not that keen on being responsible for another living thing.  I don't have plants, much less pets.  I'm happy only having to look out for myself, thank you very much.  I mean, I'd love to have a cat, but I'd be too scared I'd do something horribly wrong or not give them enough attention or something.  And the hair would get over everything!  My interaction with cats consists of my girlfriend's three cats.  She just got the kitten.  Was just going to mind it for a few days as her landlord was giving it up, but the kitty grew on her.  The darn thing is just so completely cute.  This must be some evolutionary trait.  Their cuteness is a means of survival by encouraging humans to grow attached to them while their cuteness persists.  This one just oozes the cute.  It's incredible sweet and affectionate.  It always wants to be around people, and rushes into a room whenever you're their.  Its also really playful.  She has this toy called a  urlLink cat dancer.   Just some wood on a wire that cats aparently cannot avoid swatting at.  The kitty is going nuts with the thing.  It has a wall mount, too, so it can just entertain itself with the thing.  Of course it leaps and flails about like the cutest thing ever.  Worked, too, as he convinced my girlfriend to keep him.  Her other cats are less enthusiastic, but at least warming up to him.  And as long as he stops waking me up by biting my nose (I think he's trying to suckle... yeah, AW!), I'm cool with him, too.  Even if he interupts my blog before I get to discuss  urlLink Ben and Jerry's Organic Strawberry  (not a fan) or  urlLink Cabot Chedder Slices  (BIG fan).  So, in conclusion, I'm a cat person but I don't want a pet.  Or fish.  Might want a Bonzai tree, though.

      The  urlLink Honda Element  isn't nearly as cute as it thinks it is.  Its the plastic paneling that kills it for me.  I know its supposed to be functional, as this is an Extreme Sports kinda car, but its just so damn ugly.  The only ones that kind pull it off are the silver ones, because its a light enough color to pull of the contrast with the dark plastic paneling.   urlLink Ben Affleck  should pay  urlLink Kevin Smith  to put him in movies.  I like Affleck, and all, but the fact is that when he's in a Kevin Smith film his acting is taken to another level.   Chasing Amy  and  Dogma  stand out for his best acting work by a wide margin.  Most of the time, he just mugs for the camera and allows himself to be Ben Affleck, movie star.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the worst thing in the world.  There are a number of great entertainers who forge a career playing themselves in every role.  Think Alec Baldwin.  Has there ever been a movie where he wasn't overtly Alec Baldwin?  Its the Cary Grant school of being a movie star, rather than acting.  The thing is, Affleck is GOOD when he works with Smith.  He should have been nominated for an Oscar for his work in  Dogma.   At the least, he could be taken seriously as in the running.  Ditto for Chasing Amy.  You think that was the case for Armageddon or The Sum of all Fears?  Or the absurd impressions he passes off as acting in  Good Will Hunting  and  Gigli?   (okay, he wasn't bad in  Good Will Hunting,  but there were a lot of moments where he was unintentionally amusing)  He makes his bank because people know he can act up a storm because they saw it with Kevin Smith.  I'm just saying.  Man, fresh tomatoes are good.  I mean, really store-bought are such a pale replica of the real thing.  Ditto on Strawberries.  Just got Al Franken's new book.  it was published a month early to capitalize on publicity.  Its good stuff.  Very, its funny cuz its true, though, which is also frightening.  And no fat jokes, yet, which is good.  I think I need to go now, because my girlfriend's new kitten just jumped on my lap, and seriously, do you think anyone can ignore a cute kitten?

      So, I'm watching this movie and it is quickly established that one of the lead characters is fat.  Fine, no problem with that.  Then, it is also quickly seen that this is him in the past, and now he's thin.  As the movie progresses, it pretty clearly establishest that his weight was a physical manifestation of his emotional problems and now that he's moved past it, he's thin.  Its all very "mature" rather than the vacantness of, say,  Amercian Sweethearts.   I find it just as offensive.  In the first place, its lazy filmmaking.  They are using fat as shorthand for emotional problems.  It almost doesn't need to be said that his fat is a reflection of some  psychological damage, but they say it anyway.  As if everything in life can be easily explained through psycho-babble.  Which really isn't the point of the film at all, except about fat.  Now, I might be okay with this if it was an occassional portrayal of fat characters, but this is it.  This is the only portrayal, and that makes it a reflection of bigotry.  Fat people are so narrowly defined on film that it becomes easy for people to see in such a one-dimensional manner.  Hell, just watch Oprah or Dr. Phil.  Fatness is regarded as an easy question.  Clearly, we've got emotional problems.  After all, the movies said so.  Its insulting, and it is frustrating, because this is damn near IT.  Not much else to say.  Just wanted to vent as yet another movie uses my body as shorthand.

      So, I was planning on writing an entry about what songs I'd like to do with a cover band, but I've decided I need to think about it more.  So, you get a little meandering post about little things.  I'm actually wondering if my long rants are perhaps off-putting.  Oh well.  Its my blog.  The  urlLink big fat blog  has relaunched with a new look and some new features.  Included are two new columnists, who just happen to be among my readers.  Of course, all of my readers came from the BFB right now, so this is probably new to no one.  Anyway, what I really want to discuss is something I just saw on Comedy Central's  Insomniac  with Dave Attell.  If you haven't seen the show, it basically is light-hearted but ultimately very earnest exploration of the nightlife of various cities.  This episode had him in England where he toured the offices of  urlLink Scooter Man  and I can't even begin to say how impressed I am.  Basically, this is a fleet of chauffers with mini, foldable scooters.  When you get drunk, you call them, and they send a guy out on one of the little scooters.  The scooter folds up into a dufle bag which gets put into your trunk.  Its actually small enough to fit into the back seat of a Cooper Mini if you really wanted it to.  They then drive you home.  As their motto says, "you drink, we drive".  I can't get over what a brilliant idea this is.  They set the price on the idea of it being cheaper than the price of cab ride home and then a cab ride back to get your car.  Not being much of a drinker and nothing of a driver, I don't really know much about the experience of drinking while you have your car out with you, but I've got to imagine a service like this is quite useful.  Anything to discourage drinking and driving is good in my book, and these seems like a really smart idea to provide a useful service and also protect the public.  Not, lets just see if someone tries this in the US.  Or maybe someone already has.  What?  You expect to be look it up?  P'shaw!

      My god, were the old Charlie Brown cartoons horribly depressing.  You ever sit down and try to watch one of them again?  They will leave you horribly distressed.  No wonder Charlie Brown's got such self-esteem issues.  He gets cruelly abused at every turn.  I was reminded of this watching  I love the 70's  on VH1.  [by the way, has vh1 stopped even pretending to be a music channel anymore?  i can't quite tell]  They had a clip from the Thanksgiving special where Chuck is predicting the outcome of a soon to be futile effort to kick the football, and it is revealed that he expects to DIE.  This is a kid's show and Charlie Brown is talking about how the ball is going to be pulled away and he'll  slam down to the ground and to his DEATH.  Man, they don't make kids shows like they used to.  This just reminded me, though, of how painfully depressing the Christmas Special and the Halloween Specials are.  Its not just that Chuck hates himself.  People really do hate him.  And for no apparent reason.  I mean, Charlie Brown's a nice guy, but everyone just holds him in such horrible contempt.  Indeed, they often don't even know why they hate him.  They know he's a fine fellow, they just don't like him.  It just makes you sad.  That's the appeal, though.  How many of us have felt horribly lonely and unwanted?  We can identify with Charlie Brown without any forced happy ending appended.  Its a pity party, but that serves a purpose.  We love Charlie Brown, because we feel like we know what he's going through.  The redemtion doesn't have to come from the story (though there is usually some manner of happy resolution), but rather from outside the story in that we connect with Charlie and as such don't feel so lonely anymore.  Because her was this dumb, put-upon, shmuck who was going through what you were going through.  Its not just Chuck, though.  The whole Peanuts gang are a veritable living (well...) encyclopedia of pyschological problems.  Something for everyone, I supposed.  Chronically depressed?  Charlie's your man.  Obsessively lovelorn?  Just check our Sally (or Charlie, or Lucy, or Patty...).  Unwilling to join the real world?  Just grab a security blanket like Linus.  Lucy is cruel to hide her own unfufilled longing, Schroader is an egotist, Snoopy has delusions of granduer, Marcie is a socially inept submissive, and Patty is basically abandoned by her parents and DCS case waiting to happen.  But, it all works because their flaws are allowed.  They are permitted to be flawed, depressed little kids.  And, from these depths come great insight and philosophy.  Such is life.  You find your happiness where you can, and you endure the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.  We are all blockheads.

      Well, after that over-long diatribe about cartoons for adults, I figured I'd switch back to something quick and easily digestible with some of my silly little life's ambitions.  Nothing high-minded.  Just a normal, self-involved "things I want to do before I die" kind of list.  Here goes...  1.  Become a Size Acceptance Activist.  Meaning, not just someone who just posts on the web boards.  I don't really feel like I can be as powerful a spokesperson as some of the really great Fat Activists, like  urlLink Marilyn Wann.   I also don't think I can carve out a niche by doing something genuinely revolutionary, like  urlLink Jennifer Portnick .  I'm more the type to be either a foot solider or an administrator.  Seriously, in high school, my public service work was on a Drug & Alcohol abuse task force which mostly did planning and coordination work.  No high-profile stuff like working in soup kitchens or building houses for Habitat for Humanity.  I've always felt like I'm best used doing the behind the scenes work that needs to be done.  I've got some ideas on how to develop a role in size acceptance, and this is something I trust I can check off the to-do list.  2.  Be mentioned in a major metropolitan newspaper.  Been there, done that.  I was heavily quoted in an article about Boston pedestrians in the Boston Globe.  Yay me!  3.  Sing at Symphony Hall, Boston.   Also, been there, done that.  Not a solo performance, or anything.  It was with my college choir.  It was a big deal, though, as we were specially invited by the Boston Symphony Orchestra to perform a set for an open house event they held.  We were the only not BSO group performing, actually, and since it was an open house, it was a packed house.  It was really awe-inspiring and I will never forget walking out onto the stage with 2,500 faces eagerly looking on.  4.  Get published.   A book would be nice, but I'd settle for a byline in a respectible newspaper and/or magazine.  5.  Discover the body on  Law & Order.    Yeah, now its time for the silly ones.  I want to get a part as one of the people who discovers the dead body at the start of  Law & Order.   Its not like this is the cream of the acting crop, and its not like I don't have some experience with acting.  I really want to be able to die know I was able to say, "Oh my God! Call 911!" to all of America.  6.  Get into the  urlLink IMDB.    Gotta love the Internet Movie Database.  One of the more quietly iconic sites on the net.  Yeah, I know ambition #5 would get me in, but only as a Notable Guest Star, and that doesn't really count.  Bit part in a movie, story by credit, director, whatever.  I just want to be able to do a search for "Brian Stuart" and actually find myself.  That's all for today.  Hope it wasn't too long.

      There is nothing funnier on television right now than Cartoon Network’s  urlLink [adult swim]  block.  Well, maybe The Daily Show, but frankly, nothing else is even close.  Hell, the network promos that air during the commercials on adult swim are funnier than most of what is on television!  Adult Swim is Cartoon Network’s programming block featuring more mature cartoons.  Some are comedies, other are action cartoons from Japan.  The programming is constantly changing and surprisingly responsive to its viewers.  They’ll even respond on air when a show is taken off the schedule and they might even bring it back.  Some shows are cycled on and off the schedule to keep things fresh.  It’s really come up with a strong identity as a programming block rather than a collection of individual programs.  This is actually something Cartoon Network does better than anyone else on cable and it builds a heck of a lot of brand loyalty.  This brand identity is really built with the network promos they run between the shows.  They are brilliant and unabashedly self-referential.  They are also so simple you have to admire the audacity that a network was willing to even do this.  It is just white text on a black screen.  Some show-specific promos mix things up with silhouettes of characters.  All with some cool funky jazz/rock music playing in the background.  Some are jokes about the programs, often very random at that.  Others are just weird meandering thoughts.  Kinda like reading a blog.  These promos themselves have inspired fan sites, which has to please the network.  A lot of networks have tried to make their self-promos this memorable by just making them weird, but they really haven’t worked.  I can think of those bizarre VH1 commercials with the rapping kittens with the simplistic collage style animation as a good example.  They just leave you with “huh?” rather than anything genuinely memorable.  Adult Swim gets it right and they give me a reason to stay focused during commercial breaks, which has to please their advertisers.  The comedy section includes a mixture of Cartoon Network’s original programs reruns of shows that originally ran on network TV but were canceled before their time.  This is actually something Cartoon Network has really pushed since the major success of  Futurama  and the subsequent success of  Family Guy  reruns, but its been a part of the adult swim block from day one.  By the way, if you haven’t seen  Futurama,  do your self a favor and tune in.  It is the best animation seen on television ever, with hilarious writing and acting to go with it.  The original stuff, though, is insanely brilliant and wickedly subversive.  This basically started with the long-time hit,  Space Ghost: Coast to Coast.   Cartoon Network has a huge archive of animation and are very willing to go all post-modern and revisionist to appeal to the post-Gen X’ers who like that sort of reimagining of their childhood.  VERY willing.   The best example is Harvey Birdman.  They take classic superhero, Birdman, and reinvent him as a lawyer fighting to protect fellow Hanna-Barbara cartoon characters.  It’s not afraid to make all sorts of outrageous jokes at the character’s expense.  Shaggy and Scooby?  Arrested for pot use.  Yogi and Boo Boo?  Boo Boo is an eco-terrorist.  Dr. Quest and Race Bannon from Johnny Quest get into a custody battle when their “relationship” falls apart.  Fred Flintstone?  Mafia don.  It all looks great and is so absurdist that its fantastic.  The action shows are mostly Anime stuff.  I’m not a big fan of anime, but this is the best of what’s out there.  Two shows have even managed to win me over for being so distinctly un-anime.   Cowboy Bebop  is just a great sci-fi show with very little of the usual nonsense that bogs don’t most Japanese animation.  It is episodic, yet evolving, and has some great action scenes and smart writing.  Plus the best soundtrack you’ll ever find on an animated program.  The other end of the spectrum offers  FLCL  (pronounced Fooly Cooly, I gather).  The show is so bizarre that it just grabs you.  It only has 6 episodes, so it’s not too overwhelming of a narrative, but it’s all wildly experimental as it shifts from different animation genres not just within an episode, but often within a scene.  A lot of it is very “anime-esque” but it’s as if it’s trying to deconstruct the genre’s clichés.  The subject matter is very adult and Cartoon Network really went out on a limb putting something this weird on.  Its scheduled to go on hiatus soon, so catch what you can.  Also, though it is neither anime nor part of the Adult Swim block, check out   urlLink Samuri Jack   on Cartoon Network.  I love the stylized look, but the storytelling is some of the best I've ever seen.  Very creative stuff, and it completely works.  The unfunniest thing on television? Well, that distinction goes to Adult Swim’s imitator over on Spike TV (formerly TNN).  Its just not funny or entertaining.  You’ve got Kelsey Grammer in the Flash animated  Gary the Rat.   I watched the debut, and I’ll be damned if there wasn’t a joke in the whole thing.  You’ve also got Pamela Anderson as Stripperella, which is just a thin excuse to show naked cartoon women.  It also had a horribly anti-fat debut episode.  Finally, you have the “new” Ren and Stimpy cartoons.  They should have just kept to running the classic Ren and Stimpy stuff.  The new ones are overtly adult, which really seems to have elevated the need to write smart, subtle gross-out humor and its all just blatant.  We all knew something was going on with Ren and Stimpy, but we didn’t need to have it explicitly explained that they are gay.  Its not funny to see Ren and Stimpy arguing over who is the “pitcher” and who is the “catcher”.  It’s just boring.  It’s a shame because I loved the original back in the day, but I can see that it benefited from the restrictions Nickelodeon place on it.  It forced them to be creative instead of just falling back on cheap humor.  So, that’s about all I have to say about the state of adult animation.  (Believe or not, this is the edited essay).  Cuz gosh knows you wanted to hear them.  Now, if you excuse me I have to go kill myself because some CNN reporter just asked a US soldier serving in Iraq about how great their tour of duty has been for weight loss.  *shudder*.

      Those who know me in the real world will inevitably learn very quickly that I am a notoriously picky eater.  I am oft reviled for only eating 5 things.  Now, I contend that this is a gross overstatement of how picky I am, but I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the most open-minded eater ever.  And I hate spicey food, which seems to comprise the great expanse of cooking options.  The weird thing is, I love cooking shows.  Not all cooking shows, mind you, although I could easily watch any cooking show as kind of dead viewing.  I watch and enjoy despite the fact that not only will I never make any of these things, but I wouldn't even like them if I did make them.  It started with Iron Chef but I've come to be a huge fan of  urlLink Good Eats  with Alton Brown.  Its fun, not over-involved, and is just good television.  Its also gotten me the closest to actually mimicking a TV chef.  Alton spoke of the wonder that is cast iron and helped convince me to buy a cast iron rill pan from  urlLink Lodge .  Suffice to say, I've been very pleased.  He also first introduced me to Kosher Salt.  Now, my girlfriend helped along here when she made me fresh popped popcorn with kosher salt, but Alton Brown first planted the seeds.  Now, I'm huge into Kosher Salt.  I haven't used my Table Salt in nearly a year.  I'd probably be getting an Iodine deficency if I didn't use Iodinzed salt on my lunch most days.  ANYWAY, on  Good Eats,  Alton has this flip top device for his Kosher salt that I have long coveted by have not been able to find anywhere.  My girlfriend actually went on a pretty extended search for it last Christmas trying to get it as a surprise gift knowing how much I wanted it.  She struck out, too.    The cool thing about this item is that its relatively shallow and has a top which can be raised with a trigger.  This makes it perfect for adding a pinch of salt to something.  Right now, I'm just dumping out a bit of Kosher Salt into my hand and pinching from that.  This usually wastes a lot of salt, though, and is a bit of a pain to begin with.  Alton's device just looks so simple, so perfect.  So, I keep trying to sneak into every kitchen's good store into what has felt like an increasingly hopeless search.  Until yesturday.  I happened to do a websearch for Good Eats and discovered that Alton Brown had his own  urlLink website.   On his home page was a mysterios text banner reading "Salt Cellars are in".  Was this my long-sought for Kosher Salt holder?  Indeed, my hopes were realized.  He actually sells the Salt Cellars directly.  And a thing of beauty they are!  So now, at long last, I can fully persue my kitchen dreams of pinching salt just like my hero.  Yay!  I've seriously been wanting one of these for years, and now it is within grasp.  Like I said, Yay!  Have I mentioned that I'm easily amused?

      Its actually kinda funny that I just saw American Splendor because one of my dream creative projects is to write and illustrate a comic book.  One of many dream projects.  I actually wrote a play in high school but never got to produce it.  It wasn't a very good play.  Loaded with unnecessary pop-culture references and all the characters sounded like me, which is a problem I have when writing fiction.  I've occassionally dabled with the idea of doing a movie but I haven't got the guts to gather the kind of debt that would be needed.  I still ponder it, though, if digital film-making can get realistic enough.  It gets back to wanting to tell a story.  Short of blogging, there aren't really good ways of doing that these days.  Its funny that a comic book has become my most attainable idea.  I was never into comic books as a kids.  I actually love the idea of superheros.  In movies, cartoons, TV shows, I'm always a sucker for a superhero.  I just could never get into comics.  They were always so convoluted and difficult to jump into.  But, I'm not opposed to the idea of a graphic novel and have a lot of respect to folks who do it.  The other funny thing is that I can't draw.  I mean, I'm better than Harvey Pekar.  I can do a nice little sketch, I just can't really compose a scene.  What I can do are some neat little computer graphics trace drawn from photos.  I've developed a nice little style to it and its fooled me into thinking a graphic novel might be a realistic method of creative expression for me.  I just need to figure out how to write a comic book.  hehe.  A little detail, I'm sure.  In other news, I aparently have a whooping 4 readers.  Woo hoo!  All who know me from Size Acceptance sites.  I know some might find it weird that I haven't mentioned fat issues much yet, given how wildly passionate I am about it in other venues.  I think to a large degree, I get talked out elsewhere and am frankly happy to lend my voice to the chorus at  urlLink Big Fat Blog  for instance, rather than just rant by myself.  Either that or enter the fray that are the NAAFA boards guns a blazing.  Fat politics really bother some people and they don't like that size acceptance is promoting something they don't like.  Some sites are able to foster a positive and supportive atmosphere despite occassional incursions from these trolls.  Two good examples I highly recommend can be found on my side links.  Others aren't so great, though.  Which is a shame.  Trolls come in and set up shop and intimidate anyone who disagrees with them.  But anyway, I'm sure I'll talk fat here, but until then, check out the BFB for all of the great folks posting there.

      So, I took a trip out to Boston's only non-profit art deco movie theatre (it said so, anyway, although it actually isn't in Boston) to catch a free screening of the forth-coming indie film  American Splendor .  Based on the cult comic of the same name, it tells the story of Harvey Pekar, hospital file-clerk in Cleveland.  The comic book is a weird mix of autobiography and meandering philosophy and the movie tries to recreate this by employing a really weird narative without actually going too far.  There is a story being told and its mostly linear.  The biggest trick is naration from and frequent appearance by the real Harvey Pekar.  He is, indeed, a very interesting character.  His apperances also include many of the other "real" people in Harvey's life and in his comics.  They lend a lot of credibility to their portrayals and are pretty fascinating in their own right.  The mix of documentary and fiction is even brought into the movies plot as it is commented on by the real Pekar.  All in all, it could have come off as an overwhelming gimmick, but I really think it was sold perfectly.  Paul Giamatti is brilliant as the fictional Harvey Pekar.  He's easily the bright spot of the film as some of the other characters are a touch over played.  His nerdy friend Toby, though, seems to be overplayed until the film introduces us to the real Toby and it becomes aparent that he really is as painfully nerdy as the movie made him out to be.  It actually becomes quite funny as we see the real Harvey and Toby talking (with their actors sitting behind them) and you see just how dead-on the portrayal is.  Still, given the conceit of the film as being a self-aware recreation of a recreation of reality, it is to be expected.  (Actually, a further level is brought in as the fictional Harvey views a play within the film based on his life, meaning we are seeing a recreation of a recreation of a recreation in a recreation of a recreation.  Get that?  The story is focused on examining the plight of the mundane and the struggles of what is often demeaned as ordinary.  His life is admitedly not extraordinary, but that doesn't mean it is ordinary, either.  It is a fascinating story with some great philosophy at times.  Harvey really is living the American Dream, if he doesn't always realize it.  No, his comic book never allowed him to live off his writings.  But he got to tell his story.  Much like I and so many other blog writers are doing, but he did it at a time when not everyone could just sign on and tell their story to the four interested people.  As such, his ordinary life was able to speak to a much wider audience and he was able to tell the story of his life.  That's the real American dream, I'd think.  The chance to tell our story and be remembered.  I highly recommend this film.  Great flick.

      Ah, that's right!  I meant to post every day.  Well, its before midnight, at least.  hehe  So, did you hear about FOX suing  urlLink Al Franken  over the phrase "Fair and Balanced" which apparently is the official property of Fox.  I swear, the jokes write themselves.  I'm not crazy about Franken's fat-baiting, but FOX is motivated by nothing less than bitterness.  Their court brief goes into much detail about how unfunny Franken is, as if that mattered in the least.  It also commits what I have to assume is liable when they insisted he was either intoxicated or deranged for confronting their poster boy, Bill O'Reiley.  Or is that slander.  I guess Fox isn't familiar with the concept of satire or fair use.  I don't think Franken could have come up with a better publicity stunt if he tried.  Fox is reminding us, yet again, that Ann Coulter is not as unrepresentative of the "mainstream" right as most of us would like to believe.  Its not too far from her accuasations that dissent=treason to Fox's detirmination that dissent is actionable.  It'd be funny if it wasn't so damn sad that this is really happening.  And in other news, I've been commented on!  YEAH!  That brings readership of this blog up to a whopping  urlLink two,  including myself.  Woo hoo!

      Okay, so I promissed an introduction, so here it is.  Why am I writing yet another blog dealing with absolutely nothing of importance?  Well, oddly enough, because I was inspired by a friend's  urlLink online diary.   Her diary deals with a lot of deeply personal issues and is cathartic, informing, and brilliant literature all at the same time.  I am consistantly impressed with what she is able to do with her web log and it has gotten me excited about writing again.  When I was in high school, writing was a major part of my life.  Primarily through wildly unstructured stream of conscious poetry.  I committed myself to writing something every day and I kept to it.  Was it all great literature?  Heck, no, but it kept me working at it and thinking about writing.  So that's what I am trying to do again.  My mind is constantly racing with any number of creative ideas that I never follow through on.  So, I figured, as I tried to get back to exploring my creative side, why not start small.  Hence, the disorganized meanderings that will appear here.  Now, I'm an opinionated sort, so expect ranting about more important matters than parades and vanilla flavored cola.  But, expect a lot of self-important discussion, too, and just my random observations on my life and times.  I might even get serious from time to time, but I usually hover between angry and passionate so serious doesn't get much room.  Will it be great literature?  I doubt it.  But it will be writing, and that's the point.  For now, anyway.

      I promise, I will eventually post an introduction.  But until then...  PEPSI VANILLA!  I cannot tell you how happy I am with this.  I'm a huge Pepsi fan.  I've always liked it much better Coca-Cola.  Plus, I'm a huge Vanilla fan.  My favorite ice cream is genuinely vanilla.  I like Sky Bar's just because they are 1/4 Vanilla filling.  I'm a cream soda fanatic.  So, when I heard about Pepsi Vanilla coming out, I was quite eager and I just picked up my first 12-pack today.  Yeah, I'm making too much of it.  But, sometimes its good to excited about the little things.  The big stuff is always so difficult to get your head around.  There is always so little to be excited for because there is always so much to be done.  So, I get excited for  urlLink Pepsi Vanilla,   urlLink Limited Edition Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,  and the impending release of  urlLink  NewsRadio  season sets  on DVD.  And action figures of the  urlLink Swedish Chef.   Its good to be easily amused, sometimes.

      Okay, so I'm sitting here signing up to finally join the much ballyhooed blogging revolution and suddenly I hear a drum beat.  I dismiss it, thinking it surely must be someone upstairs listening to music too loud.  It quickly becomes apparent, however, that the drum beat is growing closer and is now joined by a brass accompaniment that has all the earmarks of a marching band.  A parade, I wonder?  Now, I'm about a half-block off a major road, so this isn't out of the question.  I go to put on some sandals and walk outside to see the parade as it passed when it became increasingly apparent that the parade was much too loud to be even a half-block away.  Sure enough, a peek out my window revealed a band dressed up like police officers drumming away as they marched in front of some religious statue which was covered in fake dollar bills and an honor guard holding the Italian Flag marched in the distance.  Ah.  A Saint's Day.  A phenomenon I hadn't the occasion to witness, which is odd since I grew up and have lived in very Catholic (and more the point, Italian Catholic) neighborhoods.  Yet, here it was marching down my side street awaiting people to come from their houses and deposit money with the cash-happy religious statue.  It looked like Jesus, but so do half the Saints, anyway.  Doing a web search, I now believe it was actually a Feast Day for San Lorenzo.  Who I believe is actually Saint Lawrence who was the namesake of my first school.  Which is weird, because I'm not Catholic, but I'm told my mother didn't trust our public schools until she knew she couldn't trust the Catholic ones.  Naturally, the very small parade was followed by an old guy pushing a shopping cart full of unlicensed balloons of Spiderman, Clifford, and other children's characters.  Cuz, really, would it be a parade without unlicensed balloons?.

       urlLink Read this  in the  New York Times this morning.  (its from Sunday's paper)  The US Government is pulling out all the stops to promote the forthcoming redesign for the $20 bill.  Instead of the usual PSA's, they hired William Morris and having a full-on marketing and public relations plan, including product placement.  Product placement?  For money?  I want to make fun of it, but its actually not a bad idea.  Just funny to contemplate officials from the Treasury in pitch meetings with show-biz producers and writers trying to snag a guest spot for the $20 on an upcoming Law & Order.  Still, this is the way to build awareness and get a lot more exposure for their money.  The government usually does things the old way, so it is kinda refreshing to see the real beauracratic element of the Federal Govenment really thinking outside the cliched box for once.  Its also revealing to learn that when you see Letterman crack jokes about the $20, its not just irreverant humor.  Its the product of a meeting the Government had with the show's writers.  They wanted the new $20 to be made fun of, and pushed for it.  Makes me wonder about some other odd topics that find their way into Late Night monologues.  At least I can rest assured that  The Daily Show  wll do a hilarious bit on it.  And that's apparently just what the  urlLink Bureau of Engraving and Printing  wants.  And if it gets me blathering on about it in my blog, all the better.      Above product placement has not been paid for.  hehe

      In spite of being well aware of the premieres of every god-awful sitcom on the fall line-up, I seem to have managed to be completely unaware of the impending season premiere of the one show I bother to watch,  Friends.   Yeah, its a bit of a guilty pleasure, but the show has its merits.  And its the final season, too!  Man, how'd I miss it?  I'm very disappointed in NBC.  Eager to avoid such a similiar fate with the other couple of shows I watch regularly anymore (and I actually like TV) I paid a visit to the beloved  urlLink TWop  and the less well known  urlLink TeeVee.   I swear, TeeVee has got some of the funniest television writing I've ever had the pleasure to read, and I highly recommend reading their archives.  Today, they mock  Boston Public's  effort at a "ripped from the headlines" story that actually dates back 12 years by suggesting next week, they will cover the Rubix Cube.  hehe.  Also, in their annual effort to put odds on what horrid show will be the first to get canceled, they come up with some predictably funny stuff.  Seems this year features a proliferation of CSI rip-off's.  On the NBC series,  Las Vagas,  they suggest that it's pitch would have been "Its CSI: Miami, only in Las Vegas!"  Man, that had me laughing.  I know its bad form to just repeat jokes, but seriously, give TeeVee a try.  They've got great instincts for television and are damn funny.

       UPDATE:  You know what, never mind.  NAAFA doesn't deserve the help, because they clearly don't care about creating a safe forum.  I've put in a lot of energy into defending that board, even though  some  moderators (by no means all) kept making snide remarks whenever they got the chance and wouldn't even apologize to me personally after accidentally deleting all of my posts.  But I stayed patient.  When we were told that trolls would be dealt with, I did my best to bite my tongue.  But, they again demonstrated their lack of committment to making that forum safe for their supporters.  An individual who previously announced that he'd verbally assault any fat people he encountered is still allowed to post.  He said that a month ago.  And a week ago, he compared NAAFA to a cult.  And today, on another board, he fantasized about my death, putting me into the esteemed company of Jennifer Portnick and Marilyn Wann in the people who's deaths have been brought up at that site.  But he still gets to post at NAAFA.  I might calm down later, but for now, screw them.  I tried to help, and the powers that be seem to have no motivation to providing any respect towards me.  If for no other reason, I don't want the trolls to latch onto me as an "acceptible" target who the moderators will allow to be attacked as a pretense of attacking NAAFA.  I was happy to take the slander and threats because I felt the cause was worthwhile, but its clear to me now that they just don't want my help.  Well, the don't have it.  You want to post about fat issues, go the  urlLink BFB  or  urlLink Fat!So?   Right now, I just don't think NAAFA deserves any help.  Sorry this is disorganized and completely reverses my earlier post (see below) but I'm just really upset right now.  It bothered me to see me slandered in such a violent fashion, but then to see that same individual STILL posting at the site I'm trying to stand up for was just too much.  I just feel ill right now.  I put myself on the line for NAAFA, and it just feels like the response was a great big "Fuck You".  So, I'm just walking away.  If NAAFA doesn't want me, I'm happy to oblige.  I tried to help.  I tried to change the tone by not allowing the negative voices to overwhelm all others with their single-minded hatred for Size Acceptance.  I was prepared for people to come after me for standing up to their prejudices and arrogance.  I felt it was right, so it would be worth all the pettiness of all the trolls.  But now, I just feel sick, because now the one place I felt I could feel safe has just left me feel profoundly unsafe and unwelcome.  So I'm just going to walk away.  I know I was preaching to the choir to begin with, but don't feel any need to heed my request.  No show of resolution may be enough of the board will continue to permit negative attitudes to run rough-shod over the people who actually believe in NAAFA's mission.   ORIGINAL POST  I know I'm preaching to the choir, but any of the fat activists among my readers who are not posting at the  urlLink NAAFA Discussion Forums,  let me personally request that you sign up and join the conversation.  The NAAFA boards have been going through a sustained troll attack for months, and some head-way is finally being made in eliminating the troll influence.  Unfortunetly, the months of people they have turned away by their inflamatory rhetoric has damaged the community.  Now, given time, things will naturally get back to normal.  My concern, however, is that the trolls have set up a NAAFA hate board and are patting themselves on the back and pronouncing the "death" of NAAFA because they succeeded in driving out so many.  (Of course, they all keep blaming this on NAAFA, when really they are just complaining that THEY have been banned for their repeated attacks and insults.)  I want to show them up.  These are horrible people who entertain violent fantasies about Fat Activists on their site, and where the "moderate" voice they are so bitter that NAAFA wouldn't endorse is still obsessed with calling Size Acceptance liars and fools and what have you.  Yeah, and they are honestly surprised that they weren't allowed to keep posting this on a Size Acceptance board.  I want the recovery of the NAAFA board to be visable and unmistakable.  I'm not claiming I am a big NAAFA supporter.  In fact, I've been meaning to write a post detailing my problems with supporting NAAFA.  Still, I set aside my differences when I post at their site because I'm not too short-sighted to ignore the good that is done by NAAFA's membership and activists.  So, for anyone who has been avoiding posting there, I ask that you reconsider.  And whether you can or not, I urge you to find people who may be able to join the discussion in a positive manner and urge them to join.  I don't want to make things any easier on the people who want to bury Size Acceptance, and one way to do that is to prove the NAAFA forums can be a vibrant and productive place.  I know there are such places out there on the net, but the NAAFA-haters only see what they want.  I want to make it very, very hard on them to not see the NAAFA boards as a positive community in their enforced absense.  So, please, visit and ask others to do so as well.  I know you may not feel like you can, for whatever reason, and that's find.  But I wanted to make the request all the same.  Thank you.  That's all I have to say.

      Just in case anyone was curious, the above is what I spent my weekend doing.  (images now deleted)  Okay, not doing as in performing, but I helped it happen so I think I'm owed some credit.  hehe.  It got international attention, which is obviously very cool, and I really enjoyed the production.  But, I'm not going to babble on about it.  Just wanted to mention it.  And yes, the women were flying.  I might repost the images once the troll influx ends.

      Keeping the serious political tone of my last post, I've been wanting to write my impressions of the field for the Democratic Nomination in 2004.   I'll go over each of the nominees in ascending order of how seriously I, personally, am taking their candidacy.  This won't be a very in-depth study.  For that, I highly recommend  urlLink Slate's Ballot Box feature.   Just my own feelings here.   The Hopeless    urlLink  BOB GRAHAM:    Who?  I mean, I follow politics and even I don't have much of a clue about this guy.  I mean, I know his credentials, I just don't know what he stands for.  Doesn't seem to be much to run on, though.  I have heard that he really led the way on these photo-op friendly day-job campaign trips.  You know, where a politician does the job of an ordinary person and gets his picture taken and all that.  Governor Mitt Romney in Massachusetts did that and ran an ad which foolishly touted this as a reason to vote for him.  Of course, Massachusetts did.  Ugh.  But, while it usually just a craven photo-op, Graham apparently had done something with it and really means for them to be educational experiences for him.  So kudos for that, Bob Graham, whoever you are.   urlLink  CAROL MOSELEY-BRAUN:    Yeah, I think we all know she doesn't have a chance.  She did well in the Senate, but not really all that well.  Her partisan style seems more suited for the House than the Senate, and especially not the White House.  Still, she does raise the question of who the highest elected black female Republican is.   urlLink  DICK GEPHADRT:    Has anyone bothered to tell him that he's not going to win?  I always find it so sad when people like Gephart seem so convinced that he has a shot.  Yeah, I know, he's leading in some "polls", but it doesn't take a Political Science major to see through this.  He's too much a politician and too obviously ambitious.  I know Labor loves him, but they don't love him enough to push him to the nomination.   urlLink  DENNIS KUCINICH:   In a proper year, I should have said Kucinich first, but alas he's got even more blinded aspirants behind him.  In fairness, I don't think Kucinich thinks he has a chance, so that makes his campaign a bit easier to take than the preceding three hopeless candidates.  Yeah, I know I'm a progressive so I should like him, but I just don't.  He's uninspiring.  I'd love to see a passionate and articulate promoter of the liberal cause run for the nomination.  But Kucinich REALLY isn't it.  His progressive credentials are very debatable, too.  I'd really recommend checking out  urlLink Slate's Flip/Flop feature  on Kucinich, but I'm sure there are even better sites out there.  But, he's just here for awareness, so I'll allow it.  But he doesn't have my vote.   The Hopeful    urlLink  JOE LIEBERMAN:    My former Senator and the former vice-presidential nominee.  I was okay with Joe as veep, but much less so in the big chair.  Gore's undercredited liberal roots softened Lieberman's conservative leanings, but I don't trust Joe on his own.  Still, he's got tons of recognition as a former VP candidate and that makes him a serious contender.  I'd be shocked if he wins, though.   urlLink  AL SHARPTON:    I'm as surprised as I'm putting Sharpton so high, too, but he deserves it.  He's probably the most committed progressive voice in the campaign, though Kucinich usually gets that nod.  He's also done a lot to remedy his past mistakes and it talking like a politician in the good ways.  He's definitely not out to hang the Democrats out to dry.  He's here to raise awareness of issues, and I think he's going to do a good job of that, and hopefully shore up support for the party among Sharpton's faithful.  He's no Jesse Jackson, but he's also no longer the on-time Al Sharpton.   urlLink  JOHN EDWARDS:   Clinton II.  Honestly, its  like Clinton all over again, except more-so.  He's more attractive, and even better fundraiser (I could be wrong about that, but what the heck), and seemingly more liberal.  I'm kinda stunned that he hasn't stepped out as one of the front-runners.  He talks a very good game, has shown great personality in his appearances on  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,  and a genuine working-class background and the wherewithall to campaign to working class people.  He does seem to be confidant, so I'm going to allow the he may know more than I.  I think he's banking on a big win in the early South Carolina primary.  I hope he's right, because there is a good chance the party will lose the Senate seat he's already given up.  I still don't get that.  No matter what the polls say, I do think Edwards will be just a breath away from the front-runners come primary season.   The Hope    urlLink  HOWARD DEAN:    Dean is actually part of the downfall in my friendship with the ex-roommate I discussed a couple days back.  We were casually discussing politics and I mentioned that I thought if Dean could find an issue, he could really be a credible candidate.  At the time, he was beyond a long-shot.  Just one of those home-field guys who foolishly thinks that they can parlay a regional advantage in an early primary into a real campaign.  Of course, it never happens like that, and Dean seems to understand that.  But, back then, he just looked like he was wasting his time.  My roommate was aggressively dismissive of the notion and when I challenged her reasoning (that the nation hates Vermont because of Jim Jeffords) she responded by shutting down the conversation and insulting me.  ANYWAY, Dean hasn't campaigned like a regional, and found his issue.  I figured it was going to be health-care reform, but it turned out to be the war.  He's got some appealing points, but ultimately it all falls flat.  I like the idea of a Howard Dean candidacy, but I'm concerned his support is largely knee-jerk from anti-war folks and lacks real depth.   urlLink  WESLEY CLARK:    I've seen a lot of people say that Kerry has the most to fear from Clark, since he matches Kerry's military background and then trumps it with those four stars.  I actually thin Dean is the big loser, and Dean knows it.  Clark's real strength is giving the anti-war folks a better candidate to fall behind.  There is a long tradition of pro-Peace generals running for office, and there is good logic behind it.  After experiencing the horror of war, especially as a commander within the military system, you gain a profound appreciation for peace.  Clark is a very attractive candidate because his take on foreign policy really resonates with a lot of Americans.  His stance on domestic issues?  Well, its considerably less developed, but he's got time.  At first glance, he seems to be campaigning for the Vice Presidential slot on the ticket and is wisely letting himself get checked out by the press up-front since he's got so little political experience.  He may be much more serious than that, though.   urlLink  JOHN KERRY:    Kerry would be the front-runner if it weren't for all the people assuming he'd be the front running and declaring him dead-on-arrival for not being so.  With Clark and Dean now firmly entrenched in the front-runner role, Kerry might have the room to grow.  He's got the goods policy wise.  He's definitely a strong liberal.  Yeah, I know, he gets slammed for having too many nuanced positions.  Well, I like nuance and I'm not convinced that will be a problem with the voters.  He's also got electability all over him.  I know, my state's last nominee didn't go so well.  But, I do recall a certain war hero/Senator holding his own back in 1960.  Kerry's mix of dedication and passion could really play well.  I know his passion hasn't yet come out, but it will.  Just wait for the advertising to start up.  Kerry can really build momentum at that stage.  He's my early vote, but its still much too early to firmly decide.

      Just a quickie, this morning.  I noticed on  urlLink Yahoo  that US stocks are set to open lower because of the weak Dollar.  This seemed funny to me because when the Bush administration engaged its "Screw the Dollar" policies which have undone all the efforts in the Clinton administration to build a strong Dollar, I kept reading how this was good for the economy.  You see, a weak Dollar is good for exports, as we can make more back selling goods in countries whose currancy is strong in comparison to the Dollar.  It also discourages tourism out of the US, but encourages tourism in.  So, basically, the average American who wants to visit Paris is screwed (but, really, they're a traitor anyway for wanting to visit France) but the Frenchman who wants to, say, the monument to Marquis de Lafayette in Washington, D.C. is in luck.  So, weak Dollar is good for the US economy!  So why is it dragging stocks down?  Well, as you might have already guessed, its not that simple.  In addition to screwing over folks planning European honeymoons and border-jumping Canadians trying to get cheap booze and cigarettes, there is a downside for the US, too.  For starters, the weak dollar is bad for the rest of the world.  Remember that whole global economy thing?  The stock market is so knee-jerk that anything which is bad for the rest of the world will be bad, here, too.  Also, a little fact that seems to have slipped past the single-minded advisors in the White House is that most of our corporate borrowing comes from international investors.  A weak dollar makes for a bad investment for them, which hurts the bond market.  Obviously, there are trade-offs in both directions, but the Bush defenders repeatedly talked about the weak Dollar as if it was magical.  Kinda like the tax cuts.  I guess it still is the economy, stupid.

      Two people I wanted to mention.  First, John Ritter.  That makes me very angry.  Its just so sad and frustrating.  He's someone we should have gotten to enjoy for so much longer.  He is just such a brilliant comedian.  The best physical comedian since the silent film era.  Hands down.  And even when just playing small roles, he made you want to watch.  He had such charm, such effortless grace and flair with comedy.  Its not like he was in the best shows ever made, but he was just so damn good in them.  To lose him so young feels like an awful shame.  I wanted to see more of him.  I wanted to keep laughing.  It reminds me of how I felt when Jim Henson died.  More than the kind of respect and admiration I feel when more elderly performers passed on, I felt angry.  I felt upset.  I wanted more.  I couldn't just be glad for what we had.  It bothered me that there wouldn't be more.  Its not like either of them lived fast.  It was just stuff that happened.  The other person I wanted to talk about is Cass Elliot.  Specifically the magnificant A&E biography that debuted today.  It is such an incredibly show.  I love it.  It has none of the usual sensationalism of her story.  It treats her life and her work with respect.  It didn't regard her death as the inevitability of her weight and it actually agressively responds to that stupid myth about her choking to death.  Indeed, it also had the guts to deal with her chronic dieting not as a failure to achieve a goal.  It pointed out that it destroyed her health, which has been quietly known for a long time, but always inconvenient for many.  It acknowledges her fame as unlikely, but not as if it was some bizarre thing.  They respected the fans she had, rather than treat them like freaks.  It allowed that she was a sex symbol, and though it didn't examine whether this was in part *because* she was fat, it certainly didn't bog itself down obsessing over it being "inspite of" her size.  Also, I guess because of John Phillips death, they felt they could dispense with some of the myths of her inclusion with the Mama's and the Papa's.  Her band-mates reversed the prior story that John didn't think her voice fit with the group, and bluntly said that they felt John didn't want her because she was fat and that two never liked each other.  It didn't romantize her.  It was honest about her lonliness and her long habit of getting crushes on men who weren't interested.  It also had Denny Doherty admitting (as he has in other documentaries on the band) that he completely regrets not returning her affections and that he felt he had it dead wrong.  It did talk about her great popularity and her many close friendships.  It also honestly treated her career to a proper perspective and context.  I think I've seen all the specials on Cass and the band, and I never got the understanding of her life I did from this show.  Even on basic stuff, like her post Mama's career.  It was very informing.  And two final things it reminded me of.  She has an incredible voice.  Really amazing stuff in everything she did.  I'm wishing we had a good file-sharing network so I could download all her stuff right now.  (I know enough to know much of her output is likely unavailable on CD)  Also, she was really, really, really hot.  Great to see a bit more of her than those awful dresses she wore for the Mama's and the Papa's TV appearances.  She was an incredibly beautiful woman, and it does give me some hope that she was able to make it so big.  I think American would really take to another Cass Elliot, if only Hollywood would give one a chance.

      I guess its "blast from the past" week for me.  Had two quick encounters to people who used to be a major part of my life, which was weird.  Saw my former roommate on Wednesday.  I was in a car with my girlfriend and she pointed out a woman crossing an intersection ahead and said she thought it was my former roommate.  I looked and thought it didn't look quite right.  But the time we started moving again, though, I realized it was her.  I was very glad I was in the car.  My roommate was a really rotten person in a lot of ways.  She was a pathological liar and used her lies to really exploit people's emotions.  She was also wildly irresponsible.  I'm not sure she ever paid a bill while I lived with her.  She also treated me like dirt.  It boiled over in a big fight that was clearly not going anywhere so I just walked away from it.  Man, did that get her.  She yelled at my closed door for 30 minutes.  The flipside, though, is that I really needed her.  We moved in after I broke up with my ex-girlfriend and I really needed her help and support.  For that, I do appreciate her, but all the same, I'd rather not have to deal with her ever again.  I'm not going to waste time and effort hating her.  I just want her behind me.  Speaking of my ex-girlfriend, I just saw her for the first time in about a year and a half.  Just an odd running into each other thing while neither of us had the time to talk.  Its not that I hate her, but I'm still very angry.  I loved her and I left our relationship feeling very betrayed, very hurt, and very changed.  I was honest with her, and she took advantage of my honest in order to lie to me for two years about something very important to me.  It made me feel so worthless, like a loser.  I eventually got sick of feeling like that and I knew I had to get out.  But, It has made me less trusting and less open and I hate that.  I'm afraid now, and I hate it.  But I don't hate her.  You just have to let that go.  I'm hurt, but its not worth it.  I just want to get away from those feelings and get back to where I once belonged.  Oh, well.

      Since there was some confusion about my post from yesturday, let me make it perfectly clear that it was a joke.  No, I don't get mullets, but I obviously don't care that much about it.  I'm sure plenty of folks with mullets don't get my long hair.  Its their right.  I made a little joke out of my bemusement with mullet aficianados, and that's all it was meant.  Some jokes are made with malice.  If I wasn't clear about that, I apologize, but joking of this fashion has a long history and is intentionally of little consequence.    It was meant as a pointless and acknowledgedly petty joke.  That's all.  For more about the rich tradition of mullets, you are welcome to visit  urlLink Mullet Junky.  (be warned, some gratutitous anti-fat jokes are contained within)   Update:  That being said, I might as well get it out right now.  Somethings just bother me.  Somethings I just don't get.  Does mean I have a problem with people who are different?  Nope.  Just means I don't get it.  I don't get mullets.  I don't get golf.  I don't get tacky plaid clothing ebelished with images of Disney characters.  I don't get those sickeningly cute Mary Englewhatever illustrations.  I don't get Lifetime.  There, I've said it.  Some things, I just don't get.  Doesn't mean  I hate them.  I'm sure plenty of people don't get classical music, cartoons, action figures, DVDs, and long sideburns.  Good on them!  That being said, the comparison drawn by a comment-leaver between hairstyles and fatness is an inappropriate one.  Even if I was passing judgement on mullet-wearers, their hair-style is a choice.  Being fat isn't.  It is assumed to be a choice by those who wish to pass judgement, but a basic element of Size Acceptance to correct that myth.  I do not believe anyone is suggesting that mullets, for instance, are something you are born with.  It is a choice you make.  For instance, though I am unqualifiedly opposed to appearance based discrimination with regards to one's natural make-up, I am not opposed to businesses basing staffing, in part, on a person's chosen dress, hair style, facial hair, etc. that a person has either changed from their natural make-up (such as hair-dye) or has chosen to adopt.  I may generally disagree with such decisions, but I don't think they are wrong.  Except in public school, where unless you are portraying an explicitly hateful message with your experience, students should be free to express themselves as they please.  That being said, part of my confused tone may have come from the fact that I am less bemused and more seriously disturbed by comb-overs.  Aside from the visual aspect, I don't like comb-overs because they are an effort to disguise something perfectly normal.  I am not happy when a fat person bases their clothing or hairstyle on trying to disguise their fat.  Such approaches assume a negative about something which is inheriantly nuetral, and that is a major cause for concern.  Do not mistake me, I do not condemn these individuals, but I cannot support such actions, either.  They go against the core of my beliefs in Size-Acceptance that we should accept our bodies as we are.  As an additional arguement, I pointed out that comb-overs (much like most "slimming" clothing) just doesn't work at disgusing what you are ashamed of.  The best way, and the most productive way, to deal with such issues of shame is work on not being ashamed.  Not to hide behind a thin whisp of hair in a desperate bid to pretend you are something you aren't.  There isn't anything wrong with being bald and more than there is anything wrong with being fat. I'm not going to condone any efforts to express shame of either.  That being said, that's all I have to say for now.

      Admitedly, I have a bit of an ecentric history with my hair.  At somepoint in my freshman year of High School, I got it into my head that I wanted to grow my hair out.  I think I saw Jim Carrey on the Tonight Show wearing his hair moderately long over his ears and I wanted to try it.  But, I just kind kept growing it out, and eventually had some decently long hair and was occassionally wearing it in a ponytail.  I cut it off after doing a play that summer where it needed to be long, but then just grew it out again.  Didn't cut it for well over a year, I think and had some very long locks.  I usually wore it down, too, because you can get away with that while in school.  This long/short cycling continued through college and I eventually just let it grow out for about three years.  My hair is never quite what I wish when its long.  It gets a bit of a flip in it that is tough to manage, but it generally looks very nice all the same.  But, after college and getting into the workforce, I was wearing it in a ponytail every day.  I wasn't crazy about it in a ponytail, its just what was needed.  I should have just cut it then, but I didn't.  Just stuck with it out of a lack of inertia.  I occassionally had my ex-girlfriend braid it, which I loved but which was not something I could pull off on my own.  So, I cut it.  Its been moderately long every since.  My current girlfriend did  something to it recently that I loved, but didn't want to admit I loved since she seemed to want me to be humorously annoyed with her fiddling with my hair, but I should get her to show me what she did.  It pulled off the over the ears look I really like as well as a neat swept over the forehead.  Its a bit retro, but I'm generally a fan of retro hair-styles.  Basically, this is all to say that I am a man who cares about hair.  Which is why I really don't get two hairstyles some men don.  They are so universally and properly reviled, that I just don't know why some people keep up with them.  I mean, I don't want to be judgemental, but some of this just looks silly.  I'm very open-minded with hair, in general.  Its just these two that set me off.  The first is the mullet.  I don't get that.  Its universal short-hand for horribly low-class.  Its like you're advertising how out-of-touch you are when you have a hairstyle which is so widely seen as a joke.  It just looks silly, too.  I mean, either grow it long, or don't.  Don't make it look like you couldn't make up your mind.  I just find it a bizarre hairstyle.  But, I guess some people think its cool.  Not so with my second hated hair style.  That's just something people where to try to lie to the world, and it REALLY doesn't work.  I'm talking, of course, about the combover.  Honestly, how do men convince themselves that it looks okay to do that?  Its always horribly obvious and slimey and disturbing.  Its a hairstyle of deception and its doing a bad job of it.  Instead of making someone not look bald, it just makes them look bald and dealing VERY badly with it.  Its not covering up something you are insecure about.  You want to do that, you buy a hat like Ron Howard.  Instead, it just draws attention to the insecurity as well as what they are insecure about.  Please, men, if you are bald, just deal with it.  Comb-overs aren't fooling anyway and they make you look like an idiot.  Especially the guys who have the combovers of the single strand across the top.  As if the rest of the world will encounter them exactly as the carefully positioned themselves in the mirror.  Just stop it, already.  All men with combovers will look better without them.  Really.  Just look at Rudy Guilliani who implausabily stuck with his combover even after it was a national joke.  He finally gives it up and it makes him look considerably more distinguished and attractive.  Sorry, I know this is a very uselessly snarky post, but if I have to see another embarassingly bad comb-over or mullet, I'm afraid I might scream.

      Just saw the new UPN series,  Eve.   It had a fat character (just for one episode) and some pros and cons, which is kinda the nature of any fat character on television these days.  The Cons: A few fat jokes were made at her expense.  Not  wildly malicious jokes, but annoying jokes all the same.  Also, it opened with her not fitting in a wedding dress being designed for her by the show's lead character, which is a pretty loaded visual.  Middle-of-the-road: I'm reading a lot into this, but one of the jokes at her expense intimated that her husband to be was an FA as another character remarked that he had a pattern of dating larger women.  I'd be reading way too much to find that to be a positive, but it was a background remark that wasn't wholly negative.  Positive: As you may have gathered from my prior remarks, she was a bride.  You mean fat girls get married?  I thought that only happened on the WB.  Any time a fat character is presented as a real and happy person, its a good thing.  Not to mention that she was marrying a perfectly attractive gentlemen.  (with a Latino name, probably some subtext here)  Not that I'm too big on weighing a fat woman's worth on her ability to get a conventionally attractive mate, but its still an important departure form the limited image we're currently allowed of the prospects for BBWs in the dating world.  More importantly, one of the times a joke was made at her expense, she was allowed a nicely snarking response.  While she took the crack on her with relative grace, the object of her swipe was enraged, with heavy context to assume she was actually jealous of the fat bride.  Finally, and most covertly, the solution to a wedding dress which has proven too small was not a crash diet, as we'd often see in a sitcom.  Instread of "fixing" herself, she had the dress fixed.  I know, I'm reading a lot into this, too, but the subversion of expectations is a lot more plain here.  Now, in fairness, she wasn't really that fat.  But, clearly her weight was meant to be a function of her character so I'm not going to complain too much.  Its not like they were trying to make her out to be hugely fat, or anything.  She was what she was.  Mixed messages, but what else is new.  I'm not surprised with the negatives, but I am pleased with the good side of the portrayal.

      I finally saw  About Schmidt  and  The Hours  this weekend.  I enjoyed  About Schmidt  quite a bit, but I didn't really think it was an extraordinary effort.  Very subtle writing, which I appreciate.  The never beat you over the head with the film's point.  Even the emotional final scene played more ironic than moving.  The film kept hinting at greater meaning, but that was part of its conceit.  It seemed a study of the mediocre.  A study of the soul-killing conformity of society through someone who doesn't break out of it.  We see him stiffled.  We see his rage.  But, nothing really happens.  And that's the point, it seemed.  Like I said, nothing extraordinary, but I enjoyed.  I have to say, I didn't get  The Hours.   I mean, I understood it.  I just didn't get it.  Where Schmidt was relatively subtle, Hours really did beat you over the head with it.  The multiple storylines really didn't pay off for me.  It just seemed like three underdeveloped stories.  It was more gimmick, more gag, than useful device.  Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep's characters were so overdone that it was just boring.  Especially Moore's repressed 50's housewife.  I mean, we get it already.  Its a set-up that's been used since the freakin 50's themselves.  I'd have been more impressed if the 50's and present day situations had been swaped.  At least it would have been different.  The acting was quite nice on both counts, but I've seen better from both actors.  Heck, we saw better from Steep that year with  Adaptation's  marvelous performance.  Nicole Kidman did stand out as Virginia Woolf, but that story felt the most underdeveloped.  Perhaps because it had the most potential.  But, I guess no one is rushing out to make (or rather, market) period films about female authors.  Oh, well.  The one thing that really impressed was the acting from the supporting cast.  All of them stood out.  It was quite a switch from Schmidt where many supporting roles were played by non-actors to drive home its maddeningly ordinary point.  Here, we had a whole slew of people who've done great work on their own with standout performances in the supporting roles.  I can't think of a one I wasn't quite impressed with, but also none that stood out so much as to distract from the picture.  The perfect ensemble effect, I'd say.  About all that really worked, though.  Everything else was so unaplogetically manipulative that it just annoyed me.

      I wasn't really sure I wanted to write about 9/11.  I was half wanting to write some intentionally light and just act like nothing was happening today.  Kinda the blog equivilant of UPN running the premiere of  The Mullets.   But, I expectedly didn't want to do the anything equivilant of  The Mullets.   I also didn't write anything too political about the exploitation of the tragedy by some for political gain, but that'll get me too mad.  I just want to tell my own personal story.  I didn't find out about the events on September 11 until shortly after 10am.  Back then, I more studiously followed my employers directive to only use my computer for work related activities.  I hadn't been on the web.  The office seemed quiet, especially given how busy we should have been that week.  (Our annual meeting was at the end of the week.)  But, it wasn't enough to catch my attention.  "The South Tower of the World Trade Center just collapsed."  A co-worker quietly announced this to the office.  My first thought was whethere there were any towers at Boston's World Trade Center at the water front.  The remark didn't make sense to me.  I just didn't get it.  So, I figured I could do a quick web check to see what is going on.  I still didn't get it.  I went to Yahoo and they just had a brief AP story.  It was unreal.  It didn't make sense.  This couldn't be true.  So, I went to Boston.com.  They had pictures.  I just stared at the image of the explosion caused by the second plane.  My heart dropped.  This wasn't real.  But, of course, it was.  I gathered with my co-workers in front of our television and saw the lone North Tower standing amid a cloud of dust.  I looked over and saw a much smaller building on fire.  "Wait, what's that on the left?"  "The Pentagon."  "THE PENTAGON?!?"  I still didn't get it.  We were being attacked.  At that time, there was worry about tens of thousands of people in the towers.  It was too much.  Then, the announced that another hijacked plane was in the air.  It had crashed by then, we now know, but its not like there were cameras trained on rural Pennsylvania.  They knew very little then, and what we did know was that planes were hijacked out of Boston.  There was a lot of worry around, but most people stuck it out.  Even as the massive lonely towers of the Back Bay emptied blocks away.  We had to.  We had work.  My girlfriend at the time frequently went to the Prudential Center after getting off her overnight job.  I was worried that she might be stubborn and go anyway (not knowing it was a moot point since the building was closed) so I franticly tried to call her.  It took about three tries to get through.  I quickly asked if she could go straight home after work.  She indignantly asked why.  By the tone, I could tell that she wasn't just being stubborn.  I asked if she had watched TV at all since she got up, and she said no, and got worried and asked what had happened.  Which, meant I was going to have to tell her.  I was going to have to explain something I didn't even understand myself.  I tried to just do it as calmly as possible.  "Early this morning two planes were hijacked out of Boston..."  "Oh, my God," she interjected.  As I continued, she just gasped as the horrible story kept going.  "...at 8:45, one of the planes flew into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  At about 9, another plane flew into the South Tower of the World Trade Center."  "At about 9:45, another plane was flown into the Pentagon.  A little after 10, the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed."  She gasps very loudly at this point, and was clearly overcome at the thought.  We all were.  "Shortly after that, part of the Pentagon collapsed.  At 10:30, the North Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed.  At some point, another plane was crashed somewhere near Pittsburgh.  They think there might be other hijacked planes, but no one really knows for sure right now."  I was shaking the entire time.  I am shaking right now just recalling it.  She was stunned at all this, and I let her go to turn on the television like the rest of the nation, and start trying to understand it.  One thing I remember about that day was how quiet it was whenever I left my office.  A fighter jet flew over head during lunch, and you could just see the entire street stop and jerk their heads up trying to see what that was.  Everyone was completely on edge.  Staring blankly, looking defeated.  We found out that day that a woman who volunteered where I worked (specifically as a consultant to my department) was on Flight 11.  I know I wasn't effected the way many people were, but it was very difficult to comrehend that I knew someone who was among the first to die that day.  I went home that night and watched TV until 4am.  I know most people hated the news coverage, but I really needed it.  I needed to understand that this happened.  I needed to comprehend it.  I needed to see what had happened to let it sink in.  It hurt every time, but it was so difficult to grasp that I needed to see it.  I watched the video of the clouds of smoke billowing through the streets of Manhatten, frantic people running from it.  I saw every new video with interest, as part of the experience I needed to understand.  I watched as they discoved video of the first plane strike.  It took two years for another view of the first plane to show up, but video of the second strike kept popping up.  The ones that were the most difficult to watch where the ones from the ground.  At least, when the networks ran them with the original sound.  It *was* disturbing, but we needed to be disturbed.  How else could we react.  I viewed some of it again today and had the same sick feeling as you hear the plane roar from out of the cameras view and into the screen.  You saw it as the person holding the camera saw it.  You felt their fear and their horror as the plane banked into the building, sending an unimaginable fireball into the air.  It did a lot to make it real.  To make it something I could understand.  I needed that.  I later learned that someone I went to college with died in one of the towers.  He died a hero.  He was a volunteer firefighter turned investment something or other.  That day, he took out his red bandana, and proceeded to save many lives, eventually sacraficing his own.  My parents saw the second tower strike live.  My mother was listening the radio when a caller came on talking about a fire at the Twin Towers.  She turned on the TV and saw the helicopter footage from the New York stations.  Then, another plane came into the screen and disappeared behind the South Tower before an explosion was seen.  As the days wore on, we all tried to pick up and move on.  They said irony was dead, but it lived on.  They said things would never be the same.  That's true, but things are never the same.  When The Onion finally published again, entitling its coverage "Holy Fucking Shit", it signaled that we were getting back to normal.   urlLink  American Life  Turns into Bad Jerry Bruckheimer Movie   meant a lot to make things feel okay again.  With the captions reading "Actual photo from real life", it made it feel okay to laugh again.  It helped getting things back to normal.  Everyone has a story from those days.  Everyone has something to say.  If anything, the events brought us together through common experience, and a common compassion for the lives lost.  For those 3,000, we will remember.

      Don't worry, I'm not being horribly callous with my post topic.  Just ironic.  See, I saw a commercial today for something that just struck me as totally absurd.  A few years ago, the good people behind  urlLink Kahlua  started making these Kuhula mixed drinks.  Ordinary mixed drinks, well known to many, but now pre-made for your convenience.  Stuff like white russians and the like.  Nice idea, I thought.  I mean, I was sure they were a major rip-off, but whatever.  It seemed like a fresh way to capitalize on a popular cocktail made from your drink.  Its gone too far, though.  It started when Bailey's introduced Bailey's minis.  Now, I  love  Bailey's.  Absolutely adore the stuff, especially on the rocks.  But "minis"?  Its just Bailey's in a small container.  I don't get that.  Is it that difficult to pour the damn stuff into a glass?  Did we need to make such a dramatic contribution to consumer waste but putting them into tiny little containers?  Was there that much demand for Bailey's on the go?  Its not like the stuff is cheap, but now you're ripping people off without giving them anything.  The sillist, though, seems destined to be the most overmarketed.  Have you seen these new "Bacardi and Cola" ads that play off like they are some kind of 80's interracial crime-fighting duo?  Oy!  But, seriously, we're talking about a freaking RUM AND COKE!  You notice what's the brand name that got attached to that drink?  It sure wasn't Bacardi.  Besides that, its a RUM AND COKE!  At least Kahlua mixed in alcohol.  Bacardi is just adding some crappy non-brand cola and acting like its special.  Its a RUM AND COKE!  Sorry, its just that bares repeating.  I mean, c'mon!  That's going to far.  Let the people obsessed with getting drunk easily stick to their shitty bear and leave the hard stuff to those of us with the wherewithall to poor a glass of Coke with some Rum.  In fairness, though, it bares some mention that I don't even like Rum and Coke.  Now, a Malibu and Coke is something I like, which is downright bizarre.  I mean, I hate Coconut and I prefer Pepsi of Coke.  Malibu and Pepsi doesn't work, though, because the Pepsi is too sweet, and for some reason I like the Malibu's flavor in spite of my resistance to coconut.  Go figure.  But, being the "Girl Drink Drunk" that I am (as if I've ever been drunk!) I don't even get to the Malibu and Coke, much.  But, it did get some play in the Barenaked Ladies song, "Alcohol".  Great song, by the way.  I'd suggest buying the album but I absolutely loathe the record industry and they way the spit on their artists.  I meant to write about that a couple weeks ago, but the topic branched off into a wide discussion of labor relations that wasn't really going anywhere so I decided not to sit down and put it to paper.  Er, well, put it to bytes, anyway.  But, if you have a friend who has the album, Stunt, give it a listen.  Its a very fun track, followed up by one of my personal favs "Call and Answer".  That's just one of those songs that I really, *really* get, and completely appreciate.  But, I digress.

      Yeah, I know I've put it off, so here it is at last.  When I was in high school, my class (as in, class of 1996, not an individual class room) needed a fundraiser for our eventual prom.  I was actually my class Vice President my freshman year.  I didn't win any election, mind you.  It was uncontested.  I lost pretty much every election I participated in until college when, against all logic, I won a national office with a Jesuit student organization.  So, I could muster up support to head my Junior class, but I was find for a national leadership role of an organization which nominally represented tens of thousands of students.  But, I digress...  At my high school, there were a bunch of established fund raisers that kind of rotated among the classes.  They weren't that impressive, and ours was especially lame and we quickly realized we needed to come up with something better.  One of our advisers had seen another school which did a male beauty pagaent and it was a huge success.  So, we set out to do our own.  The idea of a male beauty contest was because we basically wanted this to be a bit of a joke.  We figured that a contest for the women of the school would end up getting overly competitive and not nearly as fun as it should be.  Guys could be counted on to be just self-centered enough to do it, but too insecure in their sexuality to take it too seriously.  We let all the clubs and sports teams sponsor a contestant and did a proper beauty contest, complete with dramatic entrances, swimwear and evening wear competitions and even a talent segment.  We first did it my sophomore year.  I wasn't in it, that year.  It was almost all seniors, that year, although my freshman brother was in it.  We were lucky to have the help of a senior who was a budding producer.  He handled sound and set design and brought me in the help run the ancient stage lights.  I'm shocked I didn't die manning those things.  Over the next two years, he came back from college and made the whole production progressively more extravagent.  By my senior year, there were three video screens with fully produced videos and music for each participant. and elaborate lighting design.  He basically paid for it all as he made the contest into school work.  I was very interesting in getting into the contest as soon as possible and did it my junior and senior years.  It was a lot of fun.  The other side of our concerns about a female contest being too competitive was that the potential audience would respond very differently.  We could rely on the women of the school to come out and happily cheer contestants of all shapes and sizes, and cheer with genuine enthusiasm.  We knew darn well that many of the men in school would act like complete dicks if they were in the audience rather than on stage and turn it into a generally unpleasent experience that would be more of a lust fest than fun time for all.  Sad but true on both ends, I'm afraid, but such is high school.  But, I did have a lot of fun.  Its funny, because I had a lot of self-image troubles in high school, but always had a real streak of vanity.  But, I strutted my stuff as a geeky, lanky but shortish (not really, but compared to expectations of maleness...) guy.  As opposed to the geeky, fatish but shortish guy I am today, of course.  And I loved wearing the tux.  I've always enjoyed being well dressed.  We actually got a tux rental place to donate really top of the line tuxes to us for the weekend which was really cool.  We all had to wear them for school, too, to promote the contest and the tux shop.  (nothing comes for free, of course).  I even got to sing in front of an audience.  About the only time I got to sing just by myself for an audience.  I did a sappy love ballad my first year that got a great applause.  My senior year, I went more goofy and retro by really hamming it up to "All of Me".  I didn't win either year.  I'm sure I wasn't even close, but that definetly wasn't the point.  So, that's my beauty contest story.  I'm sure I got details wrong, but you get the idea.  Well, Bebop is on, so I must take my leave.  I'm debating getting the series on DVD, but it costs so darn much.  Oh, well.

      Sitting here, watching  Cowboy Bebop  on [adult swim] and realizing what an unfortunate story they did.  It was great when I first saw it, but its been given another meaning due to events in history.  In Bebop, Earth is next to abandoned due to an accident which destroyed the Moon sending asteroids down on Earth.  But, some people stay, and our heros find themselves there this episode.  The story progresses with a nice space chase and one of our heros trapped in a decent into Earth's atmosphere.  A crusty, old-fashioned mechanic from the surface comes to his rescue.  And here is where it gets unfortunate.  It was really a great idea.  The mechanic rescues our hero in a present day space shuttle.  It was totally character appropriate, and also had the cool visual of seeing a space shuttle in a sci-fi context, alongside more futuristic ships.  Really neat way to lend realism to the show.  But, you may have guessed the problem by now.  The shuttle chosen made great symbolic sense as it was the first shuttle sent into space.  Columbia.  To make matters worse, the rescue leaves the Columbia with its heat-resistant tiles badly damaged, endangering re-entry.  So much so, that the shuttle makes a crash landing.  All great stuff at the time, but now a little uncomfortable.  It reminds me of the scene in  A.I.  where they come upon the ruins of the World Trade Center in the flooded New York City.  History, unfortunatly, has undermined these creative ideas.  But, that's the price of science fiction grounded in reality.  You have no guarentee of what the real future will bring.  No one could have thought of NYC without the towers.  No once could have thought of another shuttle falling to Earth in pieces.  But, its something we need to allow for science fiction which seeks to bring a realism to the proceedings.  The real future won't always agree, so we need to look at the story on their own and without the knowledge of what has come.  I was going to post some general housekeeping issues (including the beauty contest story), but I'm getting very tired and I just had to retype this damn post, so I think I'm gonna get myself some sleep.

      So, I was looking for something to write about today.  (aside, I keep starting entries with "So, I was..." aren't I?  Sorry)  I have a few outstanding topics (fantasy album project, why  Deep Impact  is a good movie, random thoughts #2, a review of my favorite movies, the current state of cable television) but I want to spend more time writing them.  I'll probably do one tonight, but I'm really itching to write something now.  So, I was surfing through  urlLink Aimee's archives  and found one of those random survey type things.  My entry writes itself!  Too good to resist, so here is my offering for the morning...   1. Your name spelled backwards:  Nairb   2. Where were your parents born?   Milford, CT.  Unless the were born in the hospitals in New Haven.  I'm not 100% sure.   3. What is the last thing you downloaded onto your computer?   Wish I was at my home computer to check, but I'm pretty sure the last thing I downloaded was a program for wiping out  Spyware off your computer.  Well, except for porn, of course.   4. There was no question number four.     5. Last time you swam in a pool?   Too long.  I think April 2001.   6. Have you ever been in a school play?  Yep.  Many times.   7. How many kids do you want?  Until I'm convinced I could be a good father, I'm not sure I want kids.   8. Type of music you dislike most?   Country.  Not roots-type stuff or old-school Country and Western, mind you, but the mindless, jingoistic pap that is just crappy pop music with an accent.   9. Are you registered to vote?   Heck yeah.  I actually pre-registered before my 18th, and just got confirmation of registration in my new town.   10. Do you have cable?   Oh, yeah.   11. Have you ever ridden on a moped?   Nope.   12. Ever prank call anybody?   No.  Although, I have on rare occassion made a malicious call to a rude wrong number caller.  You ever get those?  People who repeatedly call you and then hang up when you answer the phone  and they realize their mistake?  I find that very annoying, and if it happens repeatedly (I got 4 calls from someone last week doing this), I might call them back from the Caller ID and just hold the receiver out.  Still, they aren't as bad as the people who have a wrong number and doubt me when I tell them so.  Like I don't know who lives in my own house!  But, I'm off on a tangent...   13. Ever get a speeding ticket?   I don't even have a driver's license.   14. Would you go bungee jumping or sky diving?   Probably not.  I've considered bungee jumping, but ultimately I'm not much into death defying.  I'd much rather cultivate a nice respectful relationship with death, thank you very much.   15. Furthest place you ever traveled?  Prague   16. Do you have a garden?   No.  I'd need dirt, I suppose.   17. What's your favorite comic strip?  Tie between Get Fuzzy and The Boondocks.   18. Do you really know all the words to your national anthem?   I'm a singer, so yes.   19. Bath or shower, morning or night?   Shower.  Never have time for a bath.  Always in the morning, though I'd probably do better to take them at night.  Maybe once it starts cooling down I'll try that.   20. Best movie you've seen in the past month?   American Splendor   22. Chips or popcorn?   Popcorn, as long as its good.  Not any of that pre-packaged junk.  Popcorn is meant to be popped.  Not eaten from a bag.   23. What color lipstick do you usually wear?  Um, maybe this survey wasn't meant for me.  hehe   24. Have you ever smoked peanut shells?  People smoke peanut shells?   25. Have you ever been in a beauty pageant?   Um, actually, yes.  Twice, and I wasn't a baby, either.  Long story.   26. Orange juice or apple?   Orange.  I HATE apple juice.  But, the Orange has to be no pulp.   27. Who was the last person you went out to dinner with and where did you dine?   Went to The Outback with my girlfriend.   28. Favorite type chocolate bar?  Snickers, I guess, just slightly over the Reese's Fast Break.  Unless Reese's Peanut Butter Cups count as chocolate bars.   29. When was the last time you voted at the polls?  Last November.   30. Last time you ate a homegrown tomato?  Last weekend.  Its nice to have a girlfriend who gardens.  I had sandwiches with fresh mozzerella and homegrown tomatos.  Mmmmm.   31. Have you ever won a trophy?  Yep.  Yay, youth sports!  Not like I had to be good or anything.   32. Are you a good cook?  I hold my own, but I wouldn't say I'm good.  I can follow directions, though.   33. Do you know how to pump your own gas?  I still don't drive.   34. Ever order an article from an infomercial?   Thankfully, no.   35. Sprite or 7-up?   7-Up all the way.  I'll take Sierra Mist over Sprite.   36. Have you ever had to wear a uniform to work?   Thankfully, no.   37. Last thing you bought at a pharmacy?   Generic Pain Killers, I imagine.  (not sure which one, though) ADDED: Shortly after posting, I went and got some Werther's Original candies from a CVS.   38. Ever throw up in public?   If I had, I'm repressing it.   39. Would you prefer being a millionaire or find true love?   I don't really think of true love as some unattainable concept.  At least not yet.  So, for now, give me my millions.  I feel relatively confident that I can find true love anyway.   40. Do you believe in love at first sight?   Not really.  At least not how I define love.   41. Ever call a 1-900 number?  No.   42. Can exes be friends?   In theory, sure.   43. Who was the last person you visited in a hospital?  Gosh, it was probably a long time ago when my aunt had her first daughter.   44. Did you have a lot of hair when you were a baby?  I think so, but I don't have a pic to refer to, so I could be remembering photos of my brother.   45. What message is on your answering machine?   A very plain message.  I only ever had funny messages when I was in college.   46. What's your all time favorite Saturday Night Live character?   Brian Fellows.  Its just so bizarre.   47. What was the name of your first pet?  Penfold.  A Hamster.  Much love to anyone who knows why I named my hamster Penfold.   48. What is in your purse?  Maybe there was a male version of this survey somewhere back in the annals of blog-dom?   49. Favorite thing to do before bedtime?   Watch TV, but I do that all the time.   50. Favorite song?   "Down Under" by Men at Work.   51. Who is your best friend?   I don't really have one.   52. Worst?   No one currently, thank goodness, but I'd say my ex-roommate and a "good" friend from high school (RG) would take all-time honors.   53. Favorite sibling:   Carly   54. Least favorite sibling:   Kyle, but its not like I dislike.  Just there are only two.   55. Favorite class?   Either television criticism or Acting Techniques.  The former earned me my only collegiate A+, and the later was a blast.  My final involved scripting and choreographing a stage fight with one my classmates (who I think has gone on to be a writer in Hollywood, or so I hear)   56. Are you addicted to AIM?   Not currently, and never really addicted.   57. What made you happy today?  This.

      The over name-changing SPIKE TV (formerly The NEW TNN, formerly The National Network, formerly The Nashville Network) debuted their entry into the reality TV world tonight.  Now, genrally speaking, I HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE Reality TV shows.  I don't want to see a bunch of idiots acting like scumbags.  That's why I don't watch C-Span.  (rimshot)  Give me scripted comedies any day.  But, I was intrigued with the new  Joe Schmo Show  as its a genuine twist on the genre.  Its a satire of reality shows AND a reality show.  The show is based around a fake reality show with actors and writers all manufacturing the fun.  Well, except one guy.  One guy isn't in on the joke.  With good reason.  The show is really all about him and how he thinks its all real and all the effor that is being put in to the effort to deceive him.  Its an ambitious effort, to say the least.  And the guy is just so damn sad.  He's a law-school drop-out who lives with his parents and delivers pizza.  And his efforts on the show are just so patheticly awkward.  I mean, he's got self-confidence, you have to give him that, but it just feels squirmy when he's out there fashioning himself as a leader of the "contestants" and you know the joke is on him.  I had trouble watching some of it, actually, just because it was so sad to see someone so earnestly embarassing himself.  It also gives you an appreciation for the effort reality shows must put in to ensure people like Joe Schmo don't get on air.  I mean, he just doesn't know how to handle himself.  He speaks awkwardly and unintentionally foolishly.  He just comes off like the dumb pitiful schmuck he probably is.  Which really is reinforced by his obliviousness to what is going around him.  The actors around him repeatedly screw up and over-act, but he doesn't get it.  In many ways, its really a reality show about the actors and how they are trying to deal with this.  I'm sure they didn't mean to, but they come off about as pathetically as the lead, just in a different way.  As brilliant a satire this is, you can't really escape how impossibly cruel it is.  This whole great big production, all for the benefit of one helpless loser.  Indeed, it all seems too much.  He seems too effortlessly awkward with the camera.  He seems too oblivious to what's going on around him.  You have to wonder if they'll satire the usual "twist ending" of reality tv as we discover that he's been in on the joke the whole time and it was really the hired actors who were made the fools.  Indeed, its so obvious that I'd be a lot more impressed if that's not true and they stick to their intended cruel satire.  Not sure I can get into, though, as it just makes me feel so dirty.  I don't like watching people embarass themselves.  It's always bothered me when a character is going to do ths stupid thing we all know they are going to do and can't stop them from doing, even though they will end up horribly humiliated for even thinking it was a good idea.  Even though I think it'd be a bad idea for the show, I almost want to find out that the lead is in-on-it.  Just to know all this pitiful behavior wasn't real.

      I referenced my odd library of fiction a while back, so I thought it would be interesting for you all to see just what that library is.

      Or rather, whining about writing.  I'm not getting nearly as far into sketching out my NaNoWriMo novel as I wanted to be by now.  It hasn't helped that I've been either stressed or sick or both since Columbus Day.  I haven't even had the time to write long overude responses to the wonderful  urlLink Aimee,  to whom I owe about a million emails.  So, just get myself thinking about my novel, I'm going to tempt fate and write about what I'm planning on writing.  I always find it dangerous to get ahead of myself, but what the hell.  I always do it anyway, so no need to keep up the pretense.  I had a few ideas before I zeroed in on the one I've been "preparing".  Two sci-fi kinda stories and one not.  I'm going with the one not, in large part because the idea was so small.  The novel is meant to take place over one day, in fact.  That's part of the gimmick I mentioned in an earlier post.  Every chapter will be an hour and their will be 24 chapters.  Basically, its the day in the life of a college dorm.  I always remember this one day my freshmen year when everything got turned upside down.  I was actually sick that day and slept through most of it and was just weirded out when I woke up in the middle of the night to find everything was screwed up.  Long-time couples had broken up, friends were hooking up, couches were stolen.  So, the idea of a day of hell has always interested me.  Plus, I figured, I could use the large base of characters to flesh out the plot when the gimmick proved more of a liability than asset.  Not that I'll really be writing a novel with 50 equal characters.  There will be three primary characters who begin the story and then end it.   They are the core of it.  Then, there will be 2 or 3 secondary plot lines to flesh things out.  Most of it will be intentionally light but thoughtful, though I'm heavily tempted to do a heavy story out of nowhere in the last few chapters.  It'll probably depend on where I am with my word count when I get to the wee hours of the morning.  My problem is that I've got very little planning on who the cast of characters will be.  I mean, I know the central trio very well, and I have a loose idea of what will go on around them, but its all the side stuff that I'm lost on.  Especially what I'm going to have everyone do and how they will get there.  I want to eventually set up a hook-up between two of the leads, but I'm not sure how to get them there.  The 24 hour idea makes that tough.  I have to establish these relationships in the coarse of this day, after all.  And it isn't helping that I have no conception of how long it will take to tell this story.  Sometimes, I'm worried about making the word count.  Other times, I'm worried about writing too much.  I'm inclined to just take it easy, though, and do the whole fly by the seat of my pants thing.  Just dive right in and see what happens.  I have such phenomenally low expectations, after all, that I can hardly end up disappointed if it doesn't go anywhere.  But, we'll see.  Maybe, in spite of myself, I can write something with a purpose and quality narative.  I'm not betting on it, though, but stranget things have happened.

      WARNING.  This is some heavy stuff and I don't really go anywhere with it.  Just be warned.   60 Minutes  is doing a powerful story on the Theater seige in Moscow last year.  It is very illuminating.  It is drawn from an HBO documentary, "Terror in Moscow" which will be re-run next week.  The most important message that it delivers is a reminder of why there cannot be a knee-jerk condemnation of terrorism.  Although the methods are deplorable, they can be understandable.  There is a world of difference between a group who is suffering extreme abuses from a ruling power resorting to these actions, and those who are just doing it to advance an ideology.  Simply put, there is a difference between the Timothy McVeigh's and Osama Bin Laden's of the world and the Palestinians, North Ireland Catholics, Chechens, and other such groups.  I deplore their tactics, but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't sympathetic.  I can write off the terrorists who are fueled by hate.  But those fueled by a sense of self-preservation are much more challenging.  These are people who are involved in a genuine struggle which is taking the lives of so many around them.  Their tactics are wrong, don't mistake me.  But these aren't impossibly evil people.  They are humans and that is something we need to confront.  The Russians didn't do themselves any favors, either, in trying to get the terrorists portrayed as impossibly evil.  All the more so now that we can see some of the film from inside the theater during the seige.  Although the terrorists were completely prepared to die for the cause (and completely expecting to) they were also clearly ready for a dialogue.  The Russians tried to claim that their attack occured because the terrorists started killing hostages, but that was a blatent lie.  Although a hostage was killed, it was about as accidental as it could get in that kind of situation.  It certainly wasn't an assasination.  The Russians knew this.  They had already planned to attack the hostages after tricking them into thinking the Russians wanted to talk.  Then, the Russians pumped in a gas to incapacitate, well, everyone.  The lead terrorists understood what was happening and left to another position where they put up a final fight with the Russians.  Left in the theater were the so-called "Black Widows".  These were female terrorists who had bombs strapped to them which they were prepared to set off.  Except, they didn't.  They could have killed everyone, including the Russians who raided the building after the gas took effect, but it didn't happen.  Instead, once they were all unconcsious, they were all killed by the Russian soldiers.  I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, really, but I'm also not going to condemn it.  The women could have killed a lot of people if they were playing possum, and I'm not sure the Russian army made the wrong choice there.  But, its still killing someone in cold blood.  Do you risk the killing a lot of people or do you kill a defenseless person just to be safe?  It seems like a complicated question.  Except for one thing.  The Russians killed a lot of people all on their own.  Now, just to be clear, NO hostage was killed in the process of raiding the building.  No hostage in the building when the Russians started gassing the building was killed by a hostage taker.  Not a single one.  They were all killed by the "recovery" opperation.  A whopping 129 of them.  For a variety of reasons, too.  Some were killed because they were left unconscious laying face-up in the rain and they choked to death.  Others never recovered from the gas because the authorities have never admited what was in them and they waited days before even giving doctors a clue of what was killing these patients.  To be sure, it was the terrorists who put the hostages in harms way, but that should not remove responsibility on the Russian authorities to seek to protect them.  Yes, they saved hundreds, but 129 people is still 129 people.  I just think of the scrutiny given the US government over the seige at Waco.  There is an example where I'm not sure we did things right and I think lives were lost because of how our government acted.  And there has been considerable media, judicial, and legislative scrutiny of those actions.  Indeed, a quick study to refresh my memory revealed an overwhelming majority of sites which are extremely (excessively, I would say) critical of the government's action.  And here, there is a legitimate arguement that the deaths of the people in the compound are the responsibility of people inside the compound.  No such arguement can exist in the Moscow Theatre case, yet the international reporting is largely deferential in some measure.  The Russians have been brazenly lying about the seige from the begining, but the facts aren't as easily covered up as they were in the Soviet Union.  2 people were killed by the terrorists.  129 were killed by the Russians.  (and no, I'm not counting the dozens of hostages killed in that number)  In America, it is easy to see terrorism in terms of black and white, good and evil.  That is what our experience with terrorism has been.  It has been 9/11.  It has been Oklahoma City.  It has been the Trade Center bombing.  So, it can be easy to view other struggles with terrorism around the world in the same light, but this would be grave mistake.  We mustn't give oppressive government's a blank check to do whatever they want in the name of combating terrorism.  Its just not that simple.  And we sully our nation's good name when we rubber stamp some of the brutal efforts around the world.  The real crime is, its not just England, Russia or Israel that we're talking about.  Although in each country, I feel they have committed horrible acts but I don't see them in good/evil terms either.  They are complex issues on both sides and both can elicit sympathy and condemnation.  Though I'm annoyed at our silence in the face of some of the shamefully haphazard attacks that have been launched on Palastinian civiliains (I'm sorry, but no one can justify sending missles into residential areas to carry out political retribution assinatiations), I'm more troubled at the way we are rubber-stamping the actions of governments we know damn well are being oppressive.  Nations we can see in black/white, good/evil.  Because we're letting them get away with murder, literally, as long as they say they are acting in the interest of homeland security against "terrorists".  Sorry, I know you guys the light stuff, and I half-considered switching gears half-way through and instead commenting on the 60 Minutes story on Undercover Marketing, but I just wanted to get this out and its my blog so I get to do that.  hehe.  Just be glad I'm not talking about Baseball.

      Actually took until 1987 to get into watching  I Love the 80's Strike Back  on VH1.  Man, I could comment about just about everything.  I mean, Wesley freakin' Snipes was the guy threatening Michael Jackson in the "Bad" video?  But, what I want to comment on today is something which took me entirely by surprise.  "Flowers in the Attic" was about incest?  Seriously?  Man, was I oblivious when I was 9.  And, I want to thank everyone for their encouragement in my novel post.  I was really too overwhelmed to know what to say, but thank you all.  Really means a lot to have such supportive comments when I really wasn't looking for anything.  I mean, I was just whining without purpose, but thanks everyone.

      I've been strongly considering joining my readers Aimee and Kell in participating in the National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo).  After all, I started this blog as a means of getting back into the habit of writing.  It seems only fitting to jump into such a bold challenge and see where it leaves it me.  There is one problem, though.  I suck at fiction.  Poems? Cool.  Editorializing?  I'm there.  Plays/screenplays?  All over it.  Stories?  Now, there is my problem.  Its never something I've gotten the hang of.  My writing is too dialogue heavy.  Too self-consciously unconventional.  Too visually oriented.  And, there is the added problem that I don't read fiction.  I'll be posting my personal library of novels soon, and its just down right amusing.  I own two novels that I didn't buy for school.  Well, not counting the Hitchhiker's Trilogy, anyway.  The closest thing to a favorite writer is Douglas Coupland, and I've only read two of his books.  I like reading quick stuff, not long stories.  Even the novels I bought for school, I mostly skimmed with a couple notable exceptions.  (I  love  D.H. Thomas'  The White Hotel)   Who am I to think I can write a novel?  Well, for the most part, I'm playing to those insecurities.  For one, I'm not going to sign up for the competition until I'm at least half-way through and with good reason to think I'll be able to finish it.  I'm employing a literary gimmick which should give the novel more structure and thus easier for me to write.  I'm also writing a broad story without pretense.  I'll save my good writing for when I think I'm a good writer.  Just doing a silly little story for now.  I'm going radically between feeling unprepared and over-eager to get started.  I like the idea of the challenge and I am interested to see where it takes me.  Also, I'm debating discussing my ideas here, for fear of jinxing myself by talking about it.  We'll see, I suppose.

      Well, didn't take long to do that again.  I highly recommend checking out Tish's commentary on Average-size Privilege over at  urlLink Fatshadow.   It is extremely well-worth reading and contributing to the discussion and I highly recommend any of my readers who haven't yet seen it to go and check it out.  Look for her entry on October 15.  The other thing I've been reading today is about the scary views of a Christian extremists in a very high level post in the Defense Department.  Because his cronies are keen to bump him up the ranks, they are down-playing statements which aside from being profoundly bigoted, are putting men and women in uniform in very real danger by inciting Muslums to respond with the same level of righteous violence he exposes.  Thus is the story of Lt. General Jerry Boykin.  Check out the report from  urlLink the L.A. Times,  or from  urlLink NBC News,  or from  urlLink Salon.   It is some pretty disturbing rhetoric this guy has been saying to churches.  Some of it, he even says in uniform.  Despite many complaints, the Defense Department refuses to do anything about it, saying he didn't break any "rules."  Yeah, because aparently judgement calls aren't made at the Pentagon.  I guess someone endangering our foreign policies and our soldiers on the ground is okay, because it technically doesn't violate any rules.  Its all very disturbing, indeed.  But, it seems, Boykin has the answer to how we got stuck with W. as our President, according to  urlLink Salon's Joe Conason.   He reports the general as once commenting, "George Bush was not elected by a majority of the voters in the United States.  He was appointed by God."  This level of religious extremism has no place in our government or the military.  Its no wonder Muslum nations doubt our intentions when the hatred of this nutcase is so easily tolerated.

      You know, I don't post enough about just what I'm reading.  I usually feel that unless I have at least something to offer, I should just keep it to myself.  But, I keep thinking I should do more of that, so here we go...  Last month,  urlLink Slate  ran an illuminating two-part story on how the majority of people in the draft Hillary for President movement were actually conservative Republicans who were just salivating at the mere thought of getting to attack a Clinton some more.  There is actually a book writen by some GOP idealogue laying out her "scheme" to run for the White House.  All this in-spite of her continually consistant "I'm not running" stance.  Its all a funny little portrait of the single-minded obsession of many of the kind of folks Al Franken talks about.  I guess they didn't think they were funny enough.  Seems they are now attacking Hillary for  urlLink running a bad campaign.   You can't write a joke like that.  I mean, what can you do but laugh.  Meanwhile, Hillary continues to establish herself as an entirely competiant and effective representative of the people of New York.  No reason I can see for her to stop doing something she's clearly very good at.

      I guess it shows just how straight-laced I am that I  still  have no fucking clue what was in the cigar box in the 1987 anti-drug PSA where the dad confronts his kid only to learned that his son learned drug use from him, all right.  It was always a silly commercial as the kid keeps trying to answer his dad but the father keeps intereupting him to shut him.  Daddy was probablly doped up, though, so what are you gonna do.  But, I'm still mystified by that drug paraphonalia.  It looked so scary and, well, complicated.  I mean, this kid didn't look like someone who was into hard drugs.  Maybe a joint with friends, but what was that stuff?  Heroin?  Cocaine?  I still don't know.  But, I guess I'll be doing this kind of flash-back shit a lot because VH1 will start airing their sequel to "I Love the 80's" next week.  Appropriately named, of course, "I Love the 80's Strikes Back".  Hell, I even watched "I Love the 70's" and I genuinely wasn't there for that.  I really hope the release it on DVD, though.  I love this sort of meaningless pop-culture nostalgia.

      I seemed to have surprised at least one of my blog readers when I went off about ESPN a few days ago.  Yes, I like sports, and I keep meaning to write an entry on my thoughts about the major sports in the US, but I keep not getting around to it.  Ah, well.  I do want to at least get out my thoughts on the baseball playoffs as I've been a baseball fan the longest and this year's playoffs are some of the best in recent memory.  The games have been close and well played with a lot of history around all of the teams.  But, I just want to discuss the four remaining teams.  I will probably completely bore most of you, so be warned.   MARLINS  I'd like to root against the Marlins because their 1997 World Series championship is one of the low points in baseball history.  It was probably the only time a team genuinely bought a championship, and they promptly dumped the team in the off season.  It was horrible to watch and awful for the sport.  But, you have to appreciate the way the team has managed to rebuild itself and get back to this place.  They are a fun young team, there is no denying that.  Still, they are young team with little fan support, so its tough to pull of them.  Especially with who they are facing in the National League Championship Series.   CUBS  You have to like the Cubs.  They are the classic underdog.  Their fans have been waiting nearly 100 years for a World Series victory.  For much of that time, they weren't a contender, either.  They've had some great players and even better fans who are some of the most loyal in baseball.  The current team are a great bunch of players, including one the game's best ambassadors, Sammy Sosa.  Yeah, I know the cork incident, but he built up enough good will before and since that he deserves some lee way.  The Cubs are just a good baseball team that's handled a lot of ups and downs in recent years and a lot of downs in their history.  But, the fans stick through it.  Hey, I know they aren't perfectly loyal and their are a lot of fair weather Cubs fans, but with what they've been through, I'll allow it.  It would be great to see them make it to the series, and given that I'm a National League fan (I'm old school, like that) I'll happily root for them there.  Plus, they have the benefit of having Dusty Baker as their manager.  Dusty was shoved out of San Francisco after taking the Giants to the World Series last year.  He's one of the best managers in the game, and the Giants didn't show him proper respect.  Now, the Giants lost in the first round of the playoffs, and Dusty is still there.  I'd love to see him back in the series and take it home, too.  I can be very loyal to players and managers in sports who I think do a good job and aren't respected by their teams.  I love the idea of them sticking it to their detractors, and I would love to see Dusty go all the way.   YANKEES  Fans of the Yankees are some of the most spoiled in baseball.  The Yankees are never far from a World Series and consistantly field a solid team.  So, its easy to root against them.  Especially given the idea most people have that they buy their championships.  But you know what?  The Yankees don't buy championships.  The win because they spend their money well.  A lot of their money is spent keeping players, not buying them.  Plenty of teams have money and go no where.  Plenty of teams have no money and win.  Yeah, the Yankees have money and that sure helps, but they also spend it right.  They don't have a flashy team of super stars.  They have solid players who play well as a team and pick up the slack for their team mate when needed.  They also have a great manager in Joe Torre.  I may not want to root for the Yankees, but I have to respect them.   RED SOX  Ah, the cursed Red Sox.  Given that I live in Boston, you'd think I'd be a big Sox fan shouting "Cowboy Up" (long story, which I don't really get) at every opportunity.  But no.  Yeah, I know they are a hard luck story like the Cubs.  But the Cubs fans were loyal through the lean years.  The Red Sox never really had lean years.  They weren't loyal out of devotion.  They kept rooting because they LIKE losing.  They like having something to complain about.  I know that's getting cliche to say, but its damn true.  Trust me, I'm hear.  Red Sox fans are the most impatient, whiny, ungrateful, self-important fans in all of sports.  And that's saying a lot given the sense of entitlement that you find in Yankees fans.  They don't express their loyalty through fierce devotion, but rather through knee-jerk hatred of anything that isn't Red Sox approved.  We are seeing that clearly now after the absurd antics at Fenway Park for Game 3 of their series with the Yankees.  We saw Red Sox players act like complete morons as Pedro Martinez threatens Yankees and Manny Ramerez gets nutty paranoid and starts a brawl over NOTHING.  But is that the story?  Nope.  They are blasting a 72 year old Yankee coach, who has apologized, for charging Pedro after Pedro taunts him.  Oh, and they are also obsessed over the story about how two Yankees allegedly beat up a grounds crew worker who was behaving horribly unprofessionally by rooting against the Yankees from the Yankees own bullpen.  I say allegedly, because the Yankees players insist they just asked him to stop taunting them and the guy picked the fight.  Frankly, I believe them, because I know what dicks Red Sox fans are.  But its important that I say allegedly because NO ONE ELSE IS.  I swear, all of the media outlets around here are treating this as fact.  Just another thing to add to the collective persecution complex found in Red Sox fans.  The Sox fans don't deserve a winner.  They don't want one, either.  I'm hoping they don't get it.  So, weird as it is for me, GO YANKEES!  Okay, I'll try to avoid sports for a few days so I don't piss off all of my readers.  hehe.  Oh, and a special shout out to my blog reader  urlLink Aimee,  who I hung out with yesterday.  Woo hoo!

      I saw the new Quentin Tarrentino film last night,  Kill Bill.   It is a far more challenging and difficult movie than anyone seems to be giving it credit for.  The movie is very disturbing, and I think that is the intent.  Rather than movies  which desensitize us to violence, Tarrentino seemed interested in RE-sensitizing people to violence by letting it be horrible, graphic, and shocking.  The risk when trying to do something like this, of course, is that you can get two unintended responses.  You can disturb people too much.  That's certain a fair reaction to this film.  The violence is pretty awful and it is tough to take because the volume of it is just so beyond comprehension.  The flip side is you get people who still see it as entertainment, even though that is what the director is deconstructing.  Or is it?  I'm not completely sure.  Which is why the movie is difficult on the viewer.  Is it gratuitous violence, or is he exposing the entertainment of violence.  Is it over the top to lessen the effect or heighten it?  Tough to say.  I do want to learn more about the director's intent and when I do, I may comment more, but I want to post some quick thoughts now.  Aside from the violence question, it is a brilliant work of art.  Agressively bold and daring and with a total understanding of the film and the motifs in play.  He wields his deep awareness of the film to heighten the experience.  Some fight scenes are played sans musical soundtrack, allowing their brutal nature to be alone on screen.  Indeed, the sound effects are amped to jar the audience.  When the music does come in, it is either disquieting or operatic.  The irreverence of some of the music is made more obvious with the contrast to the music-less scenes, but others are played as a stylish ballet.  And really, that is all movie violence ever is.  It is a choreography, and Tarrentino delves deeply into wire-fu techniques for a surreal take on the viciousness images flying by.  Everything is played out in its own way to make the contrast and distinctions more apparent.  The violence is made all the more graphic because so much of it comes from the blade rather than the usual method of movie body counts, the gun. Vastly more.  I can only recall one gun death off-hand.  The effect of this is to personalize the violence and limit the audience's ability to disconnect.  We're used to seeing movies where the "hero" mows down countless villains with a machine gun.  Here, she holds a sword and the impact is not distant but intimate.  The question of the nature of violence as entertainment is a very relevant one.  Movies often let us off the hook when they ram a massive body count into our open eyes.  Its okay, they are aliens.  Its okay, they are zombies.  Its okay, they are terrorists.  Its okay, she's a robot.   Kill Bill  doesn't seem to want us to get away with that disconnect.  It is a daring and risky move, to be sure, and some people will not be able to handle the violence, and specifically the knowledge that some people  are  being thrilled by it.  I don't blame them at all for that response, but I do think the movie is more than that and though I caution you to be aware of what you are getting into, I would certainly recommend the film.

      Well, let the Recall Arnold campaign begin.  Oh, love the non sequiter at the end of  The Daily Show.   "This has been a presentation of ABC Sports".  I don't get that, but I still thought it was funny.  I missed the first few minutes, though, so maybe it wasn't much of a non sequitar as it seemed.  Not sure which time I got "non sequita/er" spelled correctly, so I'll leave them both.

      I don't think I even want to know how things turn out in Cali.  I'll watch  The Daily Show  but I'm just really dreading the notion that this scum bag is going to get elected in what is a farce to begin with.  All the more so if fewer people vote for Arnie than voted against the recall.  This isn't Democracy.  It's a joke.  I half-want Davis to resign right now, thus ensuring the recall becomes a moot point.  But, I know that would blow up in the face of the Democratic Party, but it may be worth it to avoid Governor Terminator.  His supports have no idea what they are doing.  Literally!  I mean, they don't know what he believes what he stands for or anything.  Just that he's a good "leader".  Really took it to those machines, after all.  This was all funny a while back, but the wave of stupid is continuing unabated.  I have to worry that people just won't wake up to this once he gets into office.  I can't console myself with the notion that he'll kill himself, because there is no reason he should have gotten this far.  I can respect a Republican candidate I disagree with.  Its the system.  I can deal with McClintock winning (he won't) but Arnie is another thing entirely.  He's mocking politics.  Mocking Government.  Mocking all that our forefathers worked to ensure.  And the fact that he doesn't get to make crappy movies for a few years is very little consolation, either.  Ugh.  And I don't even live there.  Cali has problems, but Grey Davis is WAY down on the list.  How about reforming that disgustingly unfair property law?  Man alive.  California has what might be the most immoral tax code in the history of tax codes.  Even worse than taxation without representation, because that had no pretense.  How is this not more of an issue?  It can be reformed WITHOUT raising overall taxes.  But, of course, the people who'll pay are the wealthiest and greediest.  Arnie included.  I just don't want to look.  It's like a great big car wreck.  At least the baseball playoffs have been interesting.

      I was considering posting on the Arnold situation, since I know several of my readers are Californians.  At some point, I wanted to make the point of how Cali is at risk of electing the worst governor in US History.  It took about a second for me to realize that was a dangerous overstatement.  I was mostly thinking about Reagan and Ventura.  As nutty as them running for office seemed, both had political experience before running for Governor.  Ventura was a mayor, after all, and Reagan was (rather improbably) a union president which is essentially a lobbying job.  They weren't political novices, in spite of their colorful backgrounds.  Arnold, however, falls into the recent category of political newbies who are impossibly wealthy and just go straight for the big prize.  He's got a lot of company.  My current governor is one of those types.  Jumped right into running for Senate, lost, and then went on to win the governor's office.  Inevitably, the think and campaign on the notion that since they were successful in business, they must naturally be successful in government.  The Perot arguement.  Of course, its bullshit, but especially so in Arnold's case.  I can at least understand the point when a person built a business from nothing.  But Arnold?  His fame is because he has muscles.  That's it.  I mean, I don't mean to knock acting, but any notion that this work prepares a person for government is downright bizarre.  So, basically, I just wanted to point out unprepared Arnold is for office.  And, of course, his widespread problem with sexual harrassment/assault (which, for all the Arnold supports, is NOT the same thing as "womanizing" so you can stop comparing  him to Clinton, or Kennedy, or whoever).  But, I immediately realized that it was just silly hyperbole to say he's the worst governor ever.  I mean, surely  we've elected some real nutcases in the last 200 years.  Probably more than a few people who were criminally corrupt, maybe even a murderer or two.  And I think it took me about 30 seconds to remember the horrible leaders of segregation who have a lock on all of the "worst governor" slots in recent memory.  Which got me curious, who is the worst governor in US History.  When I researched my article on the Democratic Presidential candidates, I came upon references to Kucinich being selected as one of the worst mayors in US history by an academic panel.  Surely, such information would be available for our nation's governors with a simple google search.  Nope.  Pretty much ever reference to "worst governor" was a partisan attack directed at whoever is currently in power or recently in power.  Much of it was directed at Grey Davis, but I found references to most of the states in the union where the sitting Gov has been described by political opponants as the "worst governor" in the state's history.  Democrat, Republican, whatever.  Even the genuinely courageous and Nobel Peace Prize nominated George Ryan of Michigan. (UPDATE: Who, yeah, I know was a crook, but still)  No acadmeic information at all.  Ah, well.

      Fourth post of the day! Woo hoo!  A quickie this time around, though.  Just wanted to say that my boy,  urlLink Alton Brown  is getting parodied in a Burger King commercial.  You know you've made it when a fast food franchise thinks you're an appropriate subject for a commercial.  Its kind of annoying, since its such a stupid ad, but its pretty much the definitive proof of pop culture status, so big ups to Alton for the parody.  You've made it!  (yeah, I know I just called a tv host my "boy".  Just trying to mix it up a bit and bring bad use of slang from 3 years ago to the blog)   CORRECTION  Well, turns out I was seeing what I wanted to in the Burger King commercial.  They had another ad which featured Food Network's Rachel Ray which made me re-examine my assumpsion that the ad was a mimic of Alton.  Turns out, the chef included is a Rick Bayless, a well-known chef and author from Chicago who has a show on PBS which basically does the whole take you through a market thing.  Which is hardly Alton's trademark or something unheard of for a food show.  d'oh!  So, my apologies for jumping the gun on this one.  Although, am I the only one who thinks its a little unseemly for TV chefs to be endorsing a fast food restaurant

      You know, I'm actually glad that Subway sandwiches suck, because otherwise I might be pissed off at their continually insulting ad campaign featuring Jared.  The series has built him up as a literal cult figure with worshipers and everything.  That's why I've identified them as the "Cult of Jared" ads.  The obsessive adoration of Jared has just been really disturbing, but obviously with the general adoration of weight loss in our society, most people don't see that.  It'll be tough to miss it now.  The latest duel campaign from Subway makes the religous nature of their product unmistakable.  For starters, there are the "It's okay, I had Subway" ads.  I didn't really see this as much until I found an article at  urlLink Slate  that was seeing this the same way I was.  I know I found the ads vaugely objectionable and stupid, but frankly Slate is right.  They are treating their product as a redemption.  Sure, its a joke, but how much of one?  You have to wonder after seeing the ads Jared is staring.  What Would Jared Do?  You know, like Jesus.  Ugh.  Yeah, its played for laughs, but after years of their Adoration of the Dieter, I have to wonder.  When we start seeing stained glass windows at Subway, I think we really need to start worrying.

      I have another thing to add to the list of things I don't get.  These big, front yard, holiday balloons.  Just started last year, didn't it?  With those big ugly pumpkins on Halloween followed up by Santa's and reighndeer and snowmen for Christmas.  It was cute the first time I saw one.  Significantly less so the next 50 times.  But, they're back.  And it seems the valuable cartoon character liscences are getting in on the action.  On my way to work, I saw an 8 foot tall  urlLink Winnie the Pooh  dressed up as Dracula with his arms stretched out and his cape unfurled.  Yeah, I don't get that.  I mean, I have issues with Disney properties, anyway (although the REAL owners of Winnie and friends are about to put some legal smackdown on Eisner and friends) but who puts down $50 to $100 (sorry, its apparently $80.  $80!) for one of these monstrocities?  Its just scary, but not in a Halloween kind of scary but more Governor Terminator kind of scary.  I just don't get it.  I mean, other holiday fads have come and been played out before the next holiday arrives.  Icicle Lights, for instance.  Remember how awe-inspiring those were at first site and how fast you were sick of them?  But at least I understood them.  Inflatable lawn ornaments just scare me.

      The scum bags from the hate site are making it MUCH easier to laugh at them.  Aside from their ever present hypocritical blather ("How dare you not think what I think" followed quickly upon by "How dare you not let me think what I think") their personal attacks against me are getting increasingly bizarre.  It started over at the hate site with mocking some poem I think I wrote when I was 16 which I would be the first to admit was bad.  Took about a second for their arguement to devolve into spelling flames, long the last refuge of the moronic.  They also started trolling this blog for "proof" of what an awful person I was.  Like how I was obsessing about junk food in my first post.  Well, actually, it was my second post but I'm sure it seemed much more dramatic to lie and say it was my first.  Of course, I also brought up DVD's and action figures in that post and it was intentionally frivelous to begin with, but I guess it "proves" that I'm a gluttonous monster of some sort when I really present myself as eating healthy all the time.  You'd think I would have known better than to betray such a lie in my own blog.  Well, if I ever claimed to eat health all the time, that is.  I've usually be honest to a fault about my eating.  Am I perfect?  By no means, but I can still see that the numbers just don't add up.  By strict formula, I shouldn't be the weight that I am.  And that's as someone who admittedly doesn't eat "right" all of the time and isn't really all that fat.  When I see much greater challenges to the math than what I even see in my own life, I am quite rightly skeptical of that.  But, that's too much to respond to, I guess, so the rewrote my position so they could respond to it in a pity manner.  Things got really funny over here, though, when one of the most obnoxious and violent of the hate mongers tried to "expose" my hypocracy.  Now, strictly speaking, he was pointing out an inconsistancy of fact, which is not hypocritical by any definition.  He seemed to have spent quite a lot of time digging through Usenet postings and elsewhere and was apparently quite proud of himself for exposing me.  You see, he found one instance where I said I was thin, and then another instance where I said I was fat.  Goodness, what a hypocrite I am!  Of course, the statements were made a good 6-7 years apart.  And both were 100% accurate when they were made.  Basically, his "hypocracy" was akin to saying that in 1996 I claimed to be 18 years old, yet today I claim to be 25 and then accusing me of lying.  The funniest thing, though, is the discovery, much to my surprise, that I suffer from  urlLink Asperger's syndrome,  a disorder likened to autism.  After all, they think they read it somewhere, so that makes it an appropriate topic of discussion.  I must be quite the success story, then.  Asperger's is identified by poor social skills, an extreme discomfort in social situatins, a general lack of social awareness or nuance in language, limitations in imagination and creativity, physical awkwardness, difficulty in writing and math, obsessive compulsice, etc.  Funny that being socially inept hasn't kept me from holding a job which involves public speaking 20 times a year.  Funny that it didn't keep me from being elected to national office in a student organization covering the only national system of colleges and universities.  Difficulty in math didn't keep me from taking two years of calculus in high school.  Difficulty with creativity hasn't kept me from singing at the White House, staring in school plays, or writing a play.  My problem certainly isn't that I am obsessive compulsive, but a classic "Jack of all trades, master of none".  I was a chronic underachiever in college, hardly the brilliant eccentric classified by Asperger's.  And though I admit that I suck at athletics, my physical akwardness hasn't kept me from holding my own in a dance number or two in my time.  And my job is hardly the kind of obsessive, literal work that a person with Asperger's can excell at.  My job is primarily creative in nature.  But, this guy read it somewhere, so I guess its true.  Just wish someone bothered to tell me at some point in the last 25 years.  You'd think that I'd have known if I was autistic, but I guess not.

      Can't say how pleased I was to be able to leave on ESPN this morning to watch the Sunday NFL countdown.  I haven't watched it all season for one very offensive reason who finally got himself into enough trouble to get himself fired.  Oh, sorry, I mean offered his resignation in a way which had absolutely nothing to do with him being fired and humiliating him and going for the usual save face offered his resignation thing.  Yep, Rush is off ESPN.  I'm surprised it took him this long to stick his foot into his mouth.  He said something VERY predictably racist.  His defenders keep insisting its not racist, but bullshit.  Oh sure, he was "really" attacking the liberal sports media.  (Liberal  sports media?!?)  Yeah, right.  He assumed that the accomplishments of a black man couldn't possibly be true and had to be the result of some big conspiracy that desires a successful black quarterback.  He injected race into a situation it had NO business being brought up, for the purpose of discrediting the accomplishments of a black man.  Damn right, that's racist.  The object of his attacks, Donovan McNaab, had responded with utter civility.  He has handled himself remarkably well after having his ability question in such a disgusting manner.  I've watched Donavan since college when he played for my alma mater's conference rival, Syracuse.  The guy has the goods, and has put together more than a few MVP caliber seasons in his still young career.  Might he be overrated?  Maybe, but it sure as hell isn't because of his race.  He's also consistantly impressed as a man of great dignity and sincerity and he's impressed us all with his actions this past week.  He's a class act, unlike Rush.  The actual Football experts who shared the show with Rush were attacked several times this past week for not standing up to Rush's vile remarks.  Appropriately, they opened the show with a sincere apology and explanation.  Simply put, they were focused on doing their job and commenting on football.  Rush's social commentary didn't really register.  I can understand that.  I got the impression that none of them were happy with Rush's inclusion on the show, but they were repeatedly reassured that he's keep his social agenda off ESPN.  They heard him say McNaab was overrated and started thinking how to respond to that.  They just didn't grasp the complete point he was making until they'd already set themselves to refuting his basic point.  Afterwards, they were rightly disgusted and probably had a lot to do with ESPN asking Rush to leave.  I was skeptical from the start that Rush wouldn't keep his mouth shut, but besides that, I was deeply offended that ESPN would hire someone who expresses such contempt and hatred for people who have the same ideas and values as myself.  With him on the show, I wanted no part in it.  I'm glad to be able to return, but still very disgusted with ESPN.  This is very much like MsNBC's past situation with hate-monger Michael Savage when they were stunned that he did all the things he did before they hired him.  Rush's remarks are NO surprise, and the people at ESPN and its parent company, Disney, should be ashamed of themselves.  But he's gone, and has the duel embarassment of being investigated for rather massive and serious charges of drug abuse.  Couldn't happen to a more deserving fellow.  But, I'll stop talking about sports now.  Its one of my quirks.  In spite of being an artsy type (though not quite a metrosexual), I've always enjoyed watching some sports.  Mostly baseball, as football is too obviously cheering for clothes, but its not like much else is on Sundays.

      On to happier subjects.  And yes, I know more people urged the novel subject, but I didn't want to do it while the trolls are still bothering us.  But, yes, I am considering NaNo, although I have deep concerns about my ability to write fiction.  But I do want to talk it out a bit, and I'll get to that eventually.  So, I went to see  Lost in Traslation  over the weekend.  I actually really liked Sofia Copella's first film,  urlLink  The Virgin Suicides.    I really liked the subtle and sure way she tells the story.  Most directors, even good ones, feel the need to be horribly blunt in their films.  Basically, they've been taught to assume their audience is painfully stupid.  Which sucks for those of us who managed to get past 1st grade.  The worst of them are just completely insecure in their ability to tell a story that they keep pausing to reiterate points that probably could have been left unsaid to begin with.  They don't feel like anything can be left for question.  Sofia is clearly well versed in the genre of film and has a lot of courage and conviction to tell her stories in such a subtle and often unstated manner.  I don't know if some people are annoyed with some of the quiet, often silent, scenes in her movie, but I loved it.  It created a really beautiful atmosphere that allowed the characters to become very real.  I loved that not every scene was a slave to plot.  I loved that the "plot" itself was prefectly clear.  Even when it was doing things that could be cliche, it didn't conclude the way it might seem.  The cliches became deconstructed.  The movie was both slow and frenetic, creating a real sense of the spark between the two lead characters but having patience to show their affection and frame it with the swiftness with which they take to each other.  They let the relationship not fall into any preassumed concepts, while touching on them all.  Its not quite a friendship, not quite a love affair, not quite a father/daughter thing.  It does all this without falling into any of the traps of those concepts, while still getting to explore elements of them.  It shouldn't have worked.  I mean, as a rule I'm very disinterested with these older man, VERY younger woman deals, but this just worked for me.  I was quite impressed with Scarlet Johansson playing Charlotte.  I liked her in  The Man Who Wasn't There  but this film obviously gives her more to work with.  She's got a very natural charm and she plays off other actors so well.  Really looking forward to seeing a lot more from her, especially since she's really young.  In the supporting cast, Giovanni Ribisi does a really good job playing Charlotte's husband.  He really found the right balance, matching Bill Murray's unseen wife in being unsympathetic and sympathetic at the same time.  You understand the lead character's disenchantment without hating their respective spouses, which I thought was a very daring but effective choice.  It made me respect the story a lot more to not just demonize the spouses.  You've also got Anna Faris playing a thinly valied send-up of Cameron Diaz.  Her ditzy and oblivious actress was very well done.  She wasn't just a dumb blonde.  I mean, she was dumb and a blonde, but it wasn't a one-note thing.  At her best, she was harmlessly oblivious.  At her worst, moronically self-important.  It was a nice little dynamic, but I was puzzled a bit that her movie star had no significant interaction with Bill Murray's movie star.  Ah, Bill Murray.  Great work.  Perfect balance between comic and staight-man.  Murray is really an underrated straight-man, and it really shines here.  He doesn't do that fuction as a befuddled type of straight man who just sets up the joke.  Rather, he acts as a kind of eye of the hurricane, remaining calm while a lot of absurd stuff goes on around him.  But, not as if he was overwhelmed by it all, but rather confident and bemused.  He also flashes his comic skills at a number of points.  He's got a great dead-pan delivery that really sells the character rather than concentrating on the joke to the expense of his portrayal.  He manages this all with ease.  He also shows a lot of sincerity and depth in his interaction with Charlotte.  Murray is also a very underrated actor, and I hope he gets a richly deserved Oscar nod with this role.  He was robbed for Rushmore, which probably was a better chance since it was a supporting role, but I do think his performance is better here and I hope he can power out some notice.  I really strongly recommend this film.  The visuals are wonderful and the story is refreshingly intelligent and quietly told.  I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to Sofia Coppela establishing herself as one of the great American writer/directors.  It does seem funny, though, that she may well be the talented one in her family.

      Sorry, I know I promised a reader's choice, and I will get to that later (movie review of  Lost in Translation,  by the way, and yes I know I am creatively counting the votes) but I just wanted to discuss a little more fat acceptance before moving on.  Something that bothers me the most about the trolls who are going after NAAFA is that they make out NAAFA to be in intolerant.  Why?  Because we believe differently than them.  That's it.  That is what they twist into hatred of them.  Because we believe differently.  They feel we shouldn't be allowed to have our own site to discuss our beliefs.  They think we have to constantly be forced to justify ourselves to the people who disagree with us, and naturally no justification will suffice.  After all, we're wrong.  We can't justify ourselves.  We are promoting "lies".  So, what they are saying is that WE can't have our opinion.  They show no respect for our beliefs.  They insult them in the harshest of language, and then act like the problem is that we aren't open to different ideas.  It is a sickeningly hypocritical position, and rightly earns the anger of those they are telling to shut up.  Then the respond by saying that we "hate" them.  The people who call us liars, who insult our intelligence, who say we have no right to our beleifs, and we are the ones who hate them.  But, every fat activist has to go through every day of their life with countless people who don't agree with us.  How could we possibly get by if we were so intolerant to disagreement?  The truth is, we accept disagreement.  We understand it.  I mean, if their weren't people to disagree with us, their would be no us.  But, most people who disagree with us at least respect that disagreement on some basic level.  They may not like what we believe.  No more than we like what they believe.  But, they won't act like we don't have a right to our beliefs.  They won't act condesending and obsessive about the fact that we disagree with them.  And we don't do so in return.  If someone doesn't like my beliefs, that's fine.  I don't like dieting, after all.  I find it really sad that some people feel they have no option but to lose weight.  I think it is sad that they think this is the answer, because I know they will be disappointed and I know their is a better way.  But they don't have to agree with me, any more than I should have to agree with them.  All I ask is for respect for the disagreement.  Some, however, cannot offer that.  And that's where the trolls come from.  They cannot accept that people have different opinions than they do.  They cannot tolerate this disagreement.  That's really sad, but it also makes me angry.  My committment to fat acceptance has been a profoundly positive force in my life and the lives of many others.  How dare they say that we have no right to this.  They don't have to agree.  They can disagree with all the passion I show.  But don't come to our sites just to condemn us for having these opinions and try to shame us for not endorsing weight loss.  My problem with the trolls isn't that they believe differently from me, although they like to pretend that is the case.  Its that they cannot let me believe differently from them.  I've never gone to a weight loss support group to bash its participants for wanting to lose weight.  I know what they are feeling.  I don't like it, but I won't condemn them.  But, when you come to my support forum to take cheap shots at my beliefs, that is just unacceptible and intollerant and I can't accept that.  None of us goes through life seething with rage against dieters.  We are committed to fighting the culture of dieting and those who promote it and those who wish to destroy us for believing differently.  But, we've all had to make our peace with dealing with such individuals.  I have plenty of friends trying to lose weight.  They know how I feel about it.  I don't bother them about it, and they don't bother me.  Its just respect.  And when someone doesn't offer that, you're damn right I'll get mad.  Respect our right to our beliefs.  That doesn't mean you have to like them, but respect that we get to have them.  Don't act like we committ some great offense by having come to different conclusions than you.  If you do act like that, you have no right to act all stunned.  What you should be is ashamed of yourselves.  Not for the difference of opinion, but for your hypocritical intolerance for us just having a different opinion.  We all get along just fine with weight loss supporters every day of our lives.  Its really just YOU who we have a problem with.  All right, I've said my peace.  Now, on to Bill Murray.

      I've been feeling sick pretty much all day, for all the wrong reasons.  You might get an idea if you see my altered request below.  The violent hatred some people feel towards people who don't agree them just stuns me.  I'll agressively disagree with someone, but I generally try to keep on the ideas, or the tactics of the person.  I'm not saying I've never gone personal, but usually only after being fed up with someone else's personal attacks.  But I can't stand people who demand I accept their opinion, and when I don't, they accuse me of forcing my opinion on them.  Its tough, because those kinds of actions just are outside any concept of logic.  Hypocritical people are impossible to deal with rationally, because they've already decided their ideology overrules even basic consistancy.  They bash my beliefs but then they accuse me of being "intolerant" for not appreciating them coming into a forum for something they hate to bash my beliefs.  I mean, I know these people have to rationalize their actions somehow, but whatever perverted logic is employed is just beyond me.  But it frustrates me that I put myself out in the line of fire for an organization that has no interest in preventing even the most violent haters from participating.  The only good thing is the I know join the select company of Jennifer Portnick and Marilyn Wann as people who've had their death's fantasized about at a certain anti-fat hate-mongering board that's been set up.  It may have hurt to see such hatred directed at me, but as Marilyn is fond of pointing out, it must mean I'm doing something right.  Sorry if this didn't make sense to any of you, but it was necessarily meant to.  I just wanted to ramble on a bit.  Thanks for listening.  Oh, and any genuinely interested new readers I get in the next few days (not that I'm expecting any) you'll have to take my apology in advance if I get trigger happy and delete your comments.  Please, just try again and be patient with me.  This site address was posted at the same site where someone was fantasizing about my death, so I'm inclined to think some trolls might come this way.  I, for one, have no tolerance for people using my site to attack me.  They want to waste their time making up stories and hating me, they can do it on their own damn site.  So, if I do get any innocent folks in the crossfires, please accept my apology and I hope you can be patient with me.  Hatred is a bitch, but as disenchanted as I may be right now, I'm still not about to back down to people who just cannot tolerate someone having an opinion which isn't theirs.  Okay, enough ranting.  I have to get ready to watch  The Daily Show  anyway.  Thanks to all the good people out blog-land.  I love ya!  Seriously, now more than ever.  Oooh, and just to go out on a positive note, I've had some posts running around my head the last through days, so everybody leave your pick for my next topic in the comment field, and I will endeavor to oblige.  The choices are:  Television Review of the NBC Sitcom, "Couplings" Movie Review of "Lost in Translation" Why male riders on mass transit suck My thoughts on writing a novel  So, reader's choice!  Lets get this puppy back on track.

      Much talk in the news about the President's "surprise" visit to Iraq.  The Administration is spinning this as some daring act of heroism on the President's part.  I suspect most of America is responding in the manner my mom did.  To paraphrase, "Damn right he should be going over there after he's had all of those people risk their lives for him."  My mom was a big supporter of the bombing or Afganistan.  As was I, actually.  Indeed, as was most of the international community.  But like me, and most of the international community, she's never seen the connection  to the War on Terror and the War on Iraq.  A couple years ago, my mom was being down right jingoistic, but now she's been completely put off by Bush.  I guess it just goes to show its not just the good will of the world he has squandered as he has turned attention away from an increasingly active Al quieda and to the hardly imminently threatening Iraq.  So, upon hearing that he was visiting the troops, she thought it was literally the least he could do.  Of course, he's also facing some pretty tough questions from the White House Press Corps over this.  Mostly because he just pissed them all off by lying to most of them for weeks and hand-picking a select group of reporters who got to tag along.  It reminds me of Valentine's Day in elementary school when it was made very clear to me and my class mates that we had to get Valentine's for everyone, lest anyone feel left out.  I guess they didn't touch such lessons in sensitivity to other's feelings back when Bush was in grade school.  The greater concern is whether those invited were chosen because they were especially friendly with the White House.  And, of course, the President does himself no favors when he basically tells the left out and lied to reporters that they should be thanking him.  This is not to say that a level of secrecy wouldn't have been warrented.  Regardless of my personal feelings about his job performance, I certainly can acknowledge that a great deal of care is needed when visiting a war zone.  And while it certainly has hints of his grandstanding habits, I am sure the troops appreciated it in a way that the crew of the Air Craft Carrier the White House placed just out of sight of San Diego wouldn't.  Still, it all just feels so over the top.  Like W. realized he could live out his spy fantasies as he sneaks around "undercover" posing as a couple with Condi Rice.  And of course, his paternal instincts kept kicking in as he threatended to turn Air Force One around if the reporters didn't behave.  Seems like this all could have been accomplished if the President planned to have Thanksgiving Dinner at a military base in Germany but was really bound for Iraq.  Then you can get a full press contingent who just don't know the scope of their visit until they find themselves getting off the plane in Baghdad.  The other thing is, it doesn't seem like it was all that safe.  I mean, he did fly one of the two planes outfitted as Air Force 1.  Even with a fighter patrol and AF1's impressive defense measures, seems like that would be a pretty noticable target.  They actually were spotted by a British Airways pilot.  I'm not expert, but you have to think that some Iraqi with a beef against the US might have noticed it, too.  But, they felt it was secure, so I'll go with their judgement.  I'm more concerned by their typical stand-offish response.  I'd be more impressed with this sort of thing if  it wasn't always so overtly orchestrated or if they weren't premptively defensive.  It is reminding me of the minor out-cry over Bush's plane hopping on September 11.  A lot of people were fairly upset that our President was not providing visible leadership in one of the darkest hours of American history.  But the Secret Service were also fairly concerned about safe-guarding the President's safety.  The nation hoping made sense, even if the risk was slight.  A few people would find issue, but they really weren't being fair.  And yet, the White House still felt compelled to lie about it and make up a story about how they knew Air Force One was being targeted and they had to evade attack.  It was all fantasy.  They had no such information.  Now, they didn't have  any reason to lie.  They had a reasonable explanation and an understanding public, but they still were making up stories.  That's really disturbing all on its own.

      Sorry for the last post, but I just had to say it.  Funny way two months of daily personal insults can take their toil.  I hope everyone's Thanksgiving is going well.  Turkey Day has never been a big deal to me, probably because I'm a vegetarian.  My Thanksgiving memories are of being at relatives and feeling uncomfortable at everyone trying to accomidate me.  That's the thing that sucks the most about being a veggie is other people feeling bad about not accomidating you.  I genuinely don't mind.  Obviously, its something I'm used to and completely understanding about, but it makes me feel bad that they are feeling bad, and its all just a big vicious cycle.  So, the last two years, I've just stayed by myself all day.  Actually, I did that the previous two years when I lived with my ex, but that was mostly because I wasn't allowed to see her family so the option of spending the day with her was out of the question.  BUT ANYWAY... I've just kept to myself the last two years and I really don't mind.  Its kinda nice.  I'm making some Salmon Mignon, got myself one of those little Frisbee pies so I've got that covered, and am just going to chill out.  Watch some parade, watch some football, and just relax.  I actually have to work on Friday (and Sunday, for that matter) so the little break will come in handy.  Might even catch up on some email I've been long delinquent on and maybe right some posts I keep meaning to.  Maybe if I toss them all out at once, my cyber stalker won't know what to insult!  Now there is an idea.  But, until then, my best wishes for a happy holiday to you all, and special good wishes to Kell and her progress with NaNoWriMo.  Happy Thanksgiving!

      Some folks over at the BFB may have noticed that I've been hounding a particular poster and I thought I'd explain my actions fully.  "Mary" is the same person who has posted here under a number of nick names, most recently as "Timmy the Troll".  In addition to posting a host of bigoted and hateful things here on a daily basis for over two months, he/she also encouraged others at a hate site to troll my site.  And yes, they ARE the same person, even if Mary sneaks in a post pretending otherwise.  She posted as Timmy and as herself with the same IP address on the same day while she was also posting at the BFB.  And it is an absolute certainty that she encouraged others to join in harassing me.  Sorry, but I don't find her claim of innocence to be remotely true.  You don't get to round up people to attack someone, and they act like you had nothing to do with.  He/she is a pathetic liar and just a sick excuse for a human being.  No, I don't play nice with a person like that.  Funny thing happens when you viciously insult someone on a daily basis for two months.  Moreover, his/her pattern of posts on the BFB have been textbook trolling.  No, not of the outrageous variety, but rather of the kind who tries to change the subject from advancing the civil rights of fat people at every turn.  His/her posts are uniformly counterproductive, but in a subtle enough manner that it may not be apparent unless you knew what he/she is up to.  I'm hardly clairvoyant.  I just know who was responsible for organizing a troll attack on this site.  I also know that she used the same MO at NAAFA's site where she tried to make an issue out of a non-issue just to change the subject and put fat activists on the defensive for something they didn't even do.  No, I don't appreciate that.  I'm sick of it.  I'm fed up with people like that.  You folks don't see the effects of his/her attacks on this site.  You might see an occassional post before I can delete it, but I doubt you understand the scope of what he/she has been up to.  I'm not kidding when I say his/her harrassment has been a daily affair.  Indeed, it's contributed to a drop-off in my posting because I am just so sick of having to deal with their personal insults every time I post.  I'm frankly more sick to see that person posting at a site that should be a valuable resource, and I'm not just not going to stay quiet about it.  I'm not going to play nice with some cyberstalker.  I'm just not.

      Some very positive news out of the Bay State this weekend.  While Massachusetts has tended to poll in favor of gay marriage, the numbers have always been close.  Back in April, it was 50% supporting and 44% opposing, and that was before the jump in opposition that was seen in national polls after the Lawrence decision from the Supreme Court and Canada's move to legalize gay marriage.  One might have suspected a surge in opposition after last week's court ruling.  Actually, it was the opposite.  Well, kinda.  Support stood firm at 50% but opposition took a steep drop.  Also, opposition to a Constitutional Ammendment banning gay marriage was even stronger, sitting at 53% opposed.  That has to be a positive sign that the Commonwealth can hold the line on this, even if the politicians try to dump an Ammendment in our laps.  Especially since the soonest it would be on the ballet would be during a mid-term election year with a Governor race to boot.  A high turn-out would reduce the chance for a bill with marginal poll numbers to sneak through.  When asked about affording the legal rights and responsibilities, some polls saw the numbers climb very high, in fact.  Up past 70% support, actually.  This offers more reason to suspect that if this issue can be framed properly, that support will jump.  If people know this discussion is about the civil institution and nothing to do with their personal religious beliefs, I think a lot more people would be uncomfortable opposing gay marriage.  All interesting signs.  One negative, though, is that the state's Governor and Attorney General and blatently misinterpreting the rulling as permiting Vermont-style civil unions instead of marriages, when almost all legal scholars and observors have noted how emphatic it was they were talking about marriage and that "seperate but equal" wouldn't remedy their concerns.  But, I suspect the politicians are intent on calling the court's bluff on this one, and the court could well back down.  I'd be comfortable with a seperate system, as long as it was called marriage, too.  Either that, or start calling all civil marriages, civil unions and be done with it.  In non-gay marriage related news, I'm increasingly pissed off with these anti-baldness ads.  It seems like once or twice a year, some baldness "cure" puts out an ad which is just out-right mean-spirited, and that time is now.  Honestly, I can't think of a better case of someone promoting a stigma to promote their product.  Not to say that there isn't stigmatization of baldness in our culture, but there is still something uncomfortably annoying about the way they are trying to promote those prejudices.  I regard baldness cures in pretty much the same light as diet products to begin with, but outside of the dreck from Stacker 2 or, apparently, Amstel Light, they usually aren't just mean when promoting stigmas.  Still, I'm not sure their faux emotional promotion of the same stigmas is any better.  In a lot of ways, I can see how the mother who tells a story of how their child hated them for being fat doing a lot more damage than the gleeful cruelty of of an actress portraying a girlfriend bashing the boyfriend's formerly receeding hairline by means of praising his hairied self.  But, lesser of two evils style discussions like this are always dramatically uninspiring.  (yeah, i know that makes no sense, but it sounds nice)  But the cruelty of the baldness cure ads increasingly seem to be more interested in promoting stigmatization than in just taking advantage of it.

      Been debating topics to write about for a few days.  I've been really burned out all month from work and haven't been writing as much as I'd like.  Thank goodness I abandoned NaNoWriMo, because I'd be in no shape to write anything.  But, this isn't a whine about work blog.  Not that I think my superiors are web saavy enough to find me anyway, but I *really* am not interested in either boring you with that or dwelling on work on my own time.  Been thinking about writing a follow up to the gay marriage debate.  For all my hand-wringing over worries of a back-lash, I've also found two reasons to look more optimistically at the situation.  For one, gay marriage in Massachusetts is inevitable.  Its gonna happen, that's pretty clear right now.  That means any move to ban gay marriage is going to be a move to revoke people's rights, a move to end happy marriages.  I'm not sure that will sit well with a lot of people.  Arguing for the status quo is always easier, and in 6 months, gay marriage is going to be the status quo in the Commonwealth.  The debate of gay marriage is dominated by moderates who currently disagree with gay marriage, but not that strongly.  It may really challenge those people when real faces are put on this issue.  Also, I'm encouraged that the GOP wants to make an issue out of gay marriage in 2004.  I think they are radically overestimating how much this means to that vast expanse of moderates.  The people in the middle are precisely the type to be motivated by discouragement over the jobless "recovery", massive budget deficits, and the lack of focus in the Iraqi occupation.  Abortion never ignited these people.  Why is gay marriage going to?  The real kicker is I think a lot of those people actually would support gay marriage if they thought about it too long.  Especially since the GOP seems ill-prepared to keep the gay-hating attack dogs at bay, which will really put off the moderates.  The hyperbole employed by even Republican leaders is going to annoy people.  This maybe a deciding issue in 2004, but only if the GOP is hanging themselves with it.  But that's about all I have to say about that.  Thought about doing my second random thoughts post, but I really only have  one random thought.  How long will it take Ashton Kutchner to get washed-up enough to be doing Old Navy commercials?  Oh, and White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures freaking rule.  I wish they'd make that a perminant variation.  Its easily the best of the Reese's limited editions this year.  I hated the Honey Roaster ones.  Bleck!  And did you know  urlLink Bloom County  is (kinda) coming back?  Opus anyway.  Really, this is too important for a random thought.  I loved Bloom County and Outland back in the day when I was too young to understand all of it.  Its due back in the form of Sunday only strip starting this Sunday.  Expect it to join Boondocks and Get Fuzzy among my linked comics.  I've always loved the funny pages, especially the artists who really respect the medium.  I'm still a little annoyed that we don't get any more Calvin and Hobbes.  I'd also LOVE to be able to own all of the Peanuts strips over the years.  Schultz *made* comic strips what they are.  To paraphrase Get Fuzzy's aritst, all comics are either rip offs of Peanuts or rip offs of Far Side.  (Darby Conley actually said that all comic strip artists fall into two categories: those who started out ripping off Far Side, and those who won't admit they started out ripping off Far Side because they still are).  Have two longer posts I want to write, but I suspect they'll bore the heck out of my readers.  Well, except the troll who can always be depended upon to read very closely to find out the best way to misrepresent something to justify his/her obsession with me.  With the impending release of X-Men 2 on DVD, I kinda want to talk a bit about my super-hero fandom.  You see, its funny because I hate comic books, but love comic book movies.  That's pretty much the jist of the considered post, except I also bitch about why Warner Brothers is planning a new Superman movie instead of trying to build on their already successful Superman property,  Smallville.   I also wanted to write a bit about my thoughts about being a moderate progressive (which in non-progressive circles means a solid progressive) but I think I've overdone it with politics in the last couple of days.  So, I write about nothing much.  Just be glad I'm not discussing the latest episode of  Angel  or something horribly bloggish like that.  hehe

      The top court in Massachusetts just tossed out  a ban on gay marriage in Massachusetts and have ordered the legislature to fix it within 180 days.  The kicker is, they specifically stated that Vermont style Civil Unions would not satisfy the court's concerns with the law.  Simply put, seperate but equal ain't enough.  Hawaii and Alaska both saw the same thing, but each were able to get amendments passed.  Although an amendment to the State Constitution would probably pass, it also seems like there is enough support in the state Senate to prevent it from getting out of convention.  What's more, procedures in Massachusetts would prevent such an amendment from taking effect until 2006, at which point the genie will be decidedly out of the bottle.  I'm frankly stunned at this.  It's been hanging for about 6 months as the Court considered the case, a really extraordinary length of time for deliberation.  Moreover, I was expecting the court to take the stance lower courts did, that this is an issue that is best left to the legislature.  I kinda agreed with that, too, but never very strongly.  I am deeply concerned about what damage could be done to the movement for gay rights by too much coming too soon.  I mean, the Supreme Court only recently decided that having consentual gay sex was a protected activity, and even THAT caused an outrage.  I worry that more mainstream unease with homosexuality could be ignited if the marriage thing came too quickly.  At the same time, it is impossible to ignore how many extraordinarily important changes took place in this country because the courts stepped in.  Indeed, the only important change in civil rights that took place without the courts was the abolishing of slavery, which the Supreme Court got very, very wrong.  They got segregation wrong, too, but they also took the opportunity to fix that.  Sometimes, that is the only way for change to take place.  I guess my concern is that I don't think this is the only way to break down bans on gay marriage.  I think it is increasingly clear that things are moving overwhelmingly in the direction of supporting gay rights, and it may well have happened within a decade or two on its own.  If, however, constitutional ammendments are passed, that will make things MUCH more difficult.  Especially in the thankfully unlikely event that a federal ammendment gets passed.  But, even gay marriage opponents don't think that's a good thing.  A few of them aren't as hypocritically conservative as others.   urlLink Former Rep. Bob Barr,  for instance, is at least consistant to his philosophy.   Hardly a friend to the gay lobby, he is the guy who spearheaded the stupid fight for the Defense of Marriage act.  But, he's at least being consistant.  The DOMA allowed states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed out of the state and denied federal benefits to gay partners.  Seemed like a much ado about nothing, at the time, but it seems Barr has a soft touch.  He's an ardent federalist, and doesn't like the idea of meddling with the constitution to either restate what the DOMA already does or more importantly, forbid states from setting their own marriage laws as they sit fit.  He is, it seems, one Republican who really means it when he says "State's Rights".   He doesn't just want it when it serves his idealogy.  I still think the guy is dead wrong, but I do admire ideaological consistancy like that.  But, for now, a huge victory for gay marriage may be 180 days away.  I just hope it isn't a prelude to a lot of huge setbacks.

      Have I mentioned how much I hate the music industry?  Because I really hate the music industry.  They are destroying music, running their business like idiots, and then they blame their fans for their troubles.  I've never downloaded an album I could have bought.  I have bought albums because I had downloaded tracks, though.  I'm not alone, either.  Downloading has, at times, made me more motivated to be interested in music.  I'm lucky that my favorite band,  urlLink R.E.M.,  is astonishingly downloader friendly.  Although in this day and age that's really just being fan friendly.  I'm amazed at what they do for their fans interested in their work, and it has managed to increase my interest in one the handful of acts I'm really interested in.  A while back, they released an entire album online.  Not new stuff, granted, but it was an album of remixes from their most recent album.  A mixed bag, but it was just plain awesome that they did it.  Even offered album art to download.  They've also offered their explicit endorsement to a fan downloading site which fosters trading in bootlegs and B-Sides among their fans.  They even got better when they recently offered access to ALL of their videos and some live video to boot.  Yes, ALL of their music videos.  How cool is that?  I mean, this is a band known for their cutting edge and creative videos, and they've got it all there.  This is an act doing things right.  They've also got the clout to do that.  Most artists are too busy being stuck in the disturbingly unfair contracts that are standard in the music biz.  Any time the music companies claim they are doing things to protect the poor artists, they are lying.  Its that simple.  Did you know a musician whose music is sold online as a download is still charged in their royalties the cost of damaged CD's?  Do you know how many pennies an artist receives from those low-overhead music downloads?  Do you know the music companies aren't even bothering to PAY the artists for the download services they set up?  I recently bought an MP3 player.  Well, okay, not really.  Its one of those CD players that can play CD's burned with MP3's.  A cool comparmise from a real MP3 player.  But, it requires blank CDs, which I've started using a lot.  I stocked up on them years ago when I first got a CD burner because they were dirt cheap.  And I mean CHEAP.  I got 250 blank CD's without paying a cent through really generous rebates.  Now, I wouldn't expect that forever, but the regular price was still good.  Now, they cost a ton.  And why?  Because they are secretly taxed and the proceeds go directly to the music companies.  Its supposed to also go to artists, but guess who isn't paying the artists their share of these taxes?  The tax is secret because its built into the retail price of the blank CD's, much like blank cassette tapes.  The theory is that it is to pay for the music downloading that goes.  But, you pay whether you use the CDs to back up files or to burn music.  Doesn't matter.  Everyone pays.  Which is pretty much when I stopped feeling remotely sorry for the music industry.  Why shouldn't I steal music when I've already been fined just in case I steal music?  Honestly, how am I supposed to think what I'm doing is wrong when I'll be punished for it whether I do it or not.  What's frustrating is that the companies are sitting on a goldmine in their back catalogs.  This is stuff they aren't making a red cent on, but absurdly get to control.  Dump all of that great old stuff on a site, charge a low monthly or  yearly fee, and allow unlimited downloading.  And don't handicap the files, either.  Allow them to be used however the buyer pleases.  Fair use is protected in the US, even if the music comapnies don't like it.  I can tell you I'd sign up for that.  I remember a Mama Cass special a while back (check my post from 9.20.2003) and I kept thinking that I'd love to hear more of her early folk stuff.  But I'm no idiot.  That stuff is non-existant on CD.  I'd have loved to have been able to just jump online and download it.  I can think of tons of stuff I'd love to have.  Yes, it'd cost money to set up, but this is stuff they aren't earning a dime on that could definetly bring in some cash.  Plus, it'd work to preserve culture, which ought to be an obligation of the Music Industry.  But, as we've seen with the attacks on copyright limits, the entertainment biz doesn't much care about advancing the arts and sciences.  Ah, screw it.  I know that this is vitriol. No solution, spleen-venting, but I feel better having screamed. Don't you?  (Major brownie points to anyone who can identify that without googling)

      This is what you get for pandering to the jingoistic American Legion.  I wanted to like Wesley Clark, I really did.  But I cannot support a candidate who believes in  urlLink meddling with the first amendment.   We have never passed a repeal of our First Amendment rights, and we never should.  Freedom of expression is perhaps our most important liberty.  It is supremely American and it is an insult to all that our flag stands for to suggest we roll-back those rights.  This is a liberty our founders took very seriously, and it is something every American should be proud of.  I got to sit through a day long American Legion propaganda session when I did Boy's State in high school trying to pressure us to support their effort to re-write freedom of expression.  Their lack of a coherant point was breath-taking.  It was pure jingoism meant to indoctronate 16 and 17 year olds.  Indeed, the whole flap over flag burning is a much-ado-about-nothing scenario.  It's a fake issue.  Flag burnings happen so infrequently as to further make a mockery of the supposed justification of re-writing the constitution.  This just doesn't deserve such attention.  Its an issue being exploited by people.  This is no reason to undermine the Constitution.  America is more than a symbol.  It is more than 13 bars, 50 stars, and a field of blue.  What makes our nation is justice, liberty, freedom.  That is what our soldiers fight for when the fight under our flag.  This is what my father and my grandfather fought for.  Not for the flag itself, but for what it means.  Frankly, I think it represents a massive failure in teaching civics that this is not just understood.  That people don't understand that the flag is nothing compared to what this nations really stands for.  We, as a nation, clearly have not adequately informed our citizenry of what it means to be an America.  Our Constitution ought to be much more sacred than our flag.  Even if you don't think people ought to be burning flags, how can you think it merits meddling in such a genuinely sacred symbol of America.  I don't like it that people burn the flag to make a point.  I think it is callous and unproductive.  But that is their right.  If it is okay for someone to promote horrible racism, how can we say that burning some fabric is the more heinous crime?  Both are bad, but also are proof of the resiliency of the American nation and the American spirit.  Someone burning our flag is no threat to our nation.  How dare we repeal the first amendment to outlay such an unimportant issue.  We should not embarass the generations to come with the specticle of a crossed out amendment.  We made a mistake once in our history, and it remains a national shame that we abused our Constitution over such a trivial issue as alcohol.  There are important reasons to ammend the Constitution.  Flag burning is most decidedly NOT it.  Some say that this amendment is intended to be for our veterens.  Rather than tamper with a liberty those veterens served in defense of, why not provide more health care for those have performed duty for the armed forces?  Why not shore up the benefits our injured soldiers can recieve.  A former POW who was shot twice in the line of duty was offered a paltry 30% disability.  That is respect for our veterens?  Effort that could be spent protecting those who risk life and limb for all that that this nation stands for is instead spent pursuing a silly perversion of our Constitution.  So, I have lost a great deal of respect for Wesley Clark.  He was pandering to an American Legion audience.  He should know better.  As should Dick Gephardt and Dennis Kucinich who have also consistantly supported repealing a freedom of expression.  Howard Dean has gone the route of attacking the first ammendment but not clearly stating that HE wants to attack the first ammendment.  I don't get it, either, but thus far he hasn't had the power to actually make this issue a problem.  And much credit must be given to John Kerry, John Edwards, and Joe Lieberman who have defended the sanctity of our Constitution in the US Senate, as did Carol Moseley-Braun when she served as Senator.  I can't find what Al Sharpton thinks, but I guess he doesn't support amending the Constitution.   I still single out the Senators who have made a real contribution to defending our Constitution and am especially ashamed of the Representatives who made a contribution to meddling with it.

      Not long after I "gave up" on my novel, I started reconsidering what my issues were.  I largely decided that my concept was the primary problem and it was just too weak for what I wanted to do with it.  Now, when I first thought about doing NaNoWriMo, I had an idea pop into my head right away but I dismissed it as too science fiction-ish.  This wasn't entirely fair, as the idea was really a sort of post-modern after-life mythology, but it seemed close enough.  When I gave up on the college story, though, I reconsidered my original idea.  In about 6 hours of thinking about it, I had a very fully formed plot, a strong cast of characters, two alternative endings, and a very good understanding for the physical reality of the novel.  I was feeling very secure, and very silly for my prior defeatism.  But, I continued to procrastinate the actual writing.  I finally sat down today to work on it, and I tossed off 1,000 words in about an hour.  Problem is, I hated it.  So, I'm back where I was before, only with a better idea now.  I'm still thinking overly visually.  I'm seeing the story, but that doesn't mean I'm translating it well at all.  I still have the basic problem that I don't know how to write fiction.  Based in no small part to me not reading much fiction.  I'd like to get back to it, so I'm thinking of the project on hiatus, but I have no illusion that I'll be able to do anything this month.  But, I'm really excited about the idea which leaves me a little creatively frustrated.  Ah, well.  For another day, I suppose.

      I saw the new holiday comedy  Elf  over the weekend and was quite amused.  It worked on just about every level and had quite a few laugh out loud moments, which is saying a lot for me.  I like my comedy, but I'm usually amused inwardedly, you know?  But there were more than a few moments when I just burst out laughing.  Will Ferrell as Buddy the Elf is used to perfection.  He carries the movie but manages to not get old.  He threatens at a couple points, but the director held firm and rode through the rough waters.  This is what Ferrell does best, without a doubt, and his given the room to do what he does, but not more than is needed.  This is best accomplished by an outstanding supporting cast that is more than capable of holding their own with the sceen stealing Ferrell.  James Cann is very suited to the role of Buddy's Naughty List residing father.  He's bad, but not so bad that his redemntion seems inappropriate.  Zooey Deschanel is a revelation as Buddy's object of affection.  Its a too small part, but Zooey's work makes it hold its own.  She was really so good that I was surprised I hadn't seen her in much.  Especially when I realized what I recognized her from were from two great films,  Almost Famous  and  The Good Girl,  I was stunned that I haven't seen more from her.  She was really spot on.  I can't even quite explain the effect she created, but it was that kind of awkward, counter-culture cute that seems to go over well in Hollywood and I didn't really see what seperated Zooey from, say,  urlLink Maggie Gyllenhaal  who seems a lot more recognizable.  There's also some other actresses doing this sort of thing that I can't remember right now.  ANYWAY, the supporting cast also featured some great turns from Faizon Love, Mary Steenburgen, Amy Sedaris, and especially Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father and Ed freakin' Asner as Santa Claus.  How cool is that?  ANYWAY, the story is really held together by excellent writing.  A lot of time is taken up in setting up the story, which means they do kind of rush the resolution.  This bothered me at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I saw this as a good trade-off.  Setting up the North Pole so well allowed them to go where they did with Buddy's character.  It had to be understood that he really wasn't an idiot, just very very earnest.  It wasn't just him, after all.  We saw it.  It really gave them a lot of freedom to do a lot of funny stuff.  It also made the quick resolution make some sense, as we could understand what an honest and genuine person Buddy was, we could understand how he could change these people so quickly.  But, that's reading a lot more than is necessary into what aspires to nothing more than being a fun Christmas movie.  Good for adults, good for kids, and quite possibly a holiday classic in the making in the mold of  Scrooged.   (I'm always amazed at how an agnostic like myself can get into Christmas every year, but I guess that's just a testament to what a secular holiday it has become.)

      Governor Elect Schwarzenegger is hiring a private investigator to investigate allegations of Arnold's wide-spread groping.  Um, huh?  His hiring a private eye to find out if he, himself, has done anything wrong?  I feel bad for the people who didn't vote for Arnold, because you got stuck with a REAL piece of work.

      Right in my own proverbial backyard, we had 8 of the 9 remaining candidates for the Democratic nomination appearing at a Rock the Vote forum/debate at Fanuial Hall.  I missed the debate, both in person and on TV, but have been checking on the stories to find out what the deal with Howard Dean's  urlLink confederate flag comments  were.  Now understanding the context, I have to say that I do think Edwards and Sharpton were wrong to attack him for it BUT that Dean did an  urlLink embarassingly bad job  defending himself.  If you're going to take the route of a defiant defense, you should be able to put up a good one, and Dean didn't.  The shame is, he did have a good point, but even I didn't get it until his last remark.  And his initial comment didn't provide ANY of the context which made the remark a statement in support of racial diversity rather than pandering to racial tension.  The other thing I noted in the candid photographs of the event is how all of the candidates were clearly getting along, inspite of the bickering that went on in the debate.  That is a powerful image that the Democratic Party NEEDS to use.  Primarily elections need to be divisive, but we also need to show a unified front.  I trust that is the belief of everyone in the race (though I have concerns about Sharpton due to past behavior, and Kucinich due to current remarks) and this needs to be stressed.  The primaries are important, but do not show a lack of resolve on the part of Democrats.  It better not, anyway.  Any progressive who tries to claim there is no difference between a Democrat and George W. is going to look like a damn idiot now.  They did back in 2000, mind you, but Nader was able to sway enough people with his false advertising.  We mustn't let this happen again.  The other big issue, of course, is what they were wearing.  To appeal to young voters, the candidates went casual to varying degrees.  Mosley Braun, um, well she looked normal.  So did Lieberman and Sharpton who came in wearing jackets which they both shed for the forum.  Which actually left Sharpton looking kinda silly since his was a three-piece suit and he kept on an unbuttoned vest.  Meanwhile, John Kerry lost a jacket, but he was already tie-less.  Dean had no jacket, it seems, but he did have his sleeves rolled in a manner even I (a compulsive sleeve roller-upper) found goofy.  And finally we had the turtleneck twins, Clark and Kucinich who just seemed out of place.  Clark had on a black suit with a black turtleneck, which was really forboding on camera.  I think Kucinich did the same, but lets face it, he will never look forboding.  Other then that, I have no idea what happened.  Eh, I'll find out tomorrow on  The Daily Show.   I really need to pick a horse soon, though.  I was really high on Kerry, but I'm still quite open to Clark and Edwards.  Massachusetts' primary elections are early enough that they might still matter, but late enough to lose the non-starters.

      I don't like my novel.  Its got no plan and no point.  I should have planned more.  I might try to plot it out a bit more, but I'm considering it on semi-perminant hiatus.  Not that I'm completely undaunted.  My greatest flaw here was haphazard planning.  I may try to do some reading of appropriate books for inspiration, a bit of research, some actual planning for the plot, and maybe a whole change of outlook on the project.  As I'm pretty sure it won't be done this month, maybe I'll drop the novel concept and move back to my old idea for writing a graphic novel.  We'll see.  See, this is why I didn't think I was going to go through with this.  hehe.

      So, I had a bad experience with a doctor yesturday.  Of course, it was an eye doctor but it does go to show the dangers of doctors abusing their authority.  I went for my first eye exam in about two years.  I've worn glasses since I was 5, so I'm well versed in these visits.  I picked a new guy, because he was close to my apartment and got an appointment for my vacation week.  Just looking for the basic exam and to get a new prescription because my current glasses are showing their age.  I also have a coupon for a $40 gift certificate when I get my glasses at this great little place in Boston called S.E.E.  I should have expected problems when I had to wait an hour and a half for my exam after I got there early.  Suffice to say, I was not thrilled.  But, what happened next was the real problem.  The doc takes a visual exam of my eyes, does the Glaucoma test, does the wall test, and that's it.  He didn't actually check my prescription.  You know, the "Is it better now... or now" test.  Its such a familiar part of an eye exam that its even gotten into commercials.  None of that.  He pronounces my vision with my glasses to be 20/20 or better.  He then proceeds to lecture me about how near-sighted I am (like I wasn't aware) and start insisting on me getting a referal from my primary care physician so he can dilate my pupils.  Now, this always happened as a normal part of the exam before, but whatever.  I already knew I wasn't coming back to him so I tried to put him off and ask about getting my prescription.  The guy refuses to write me a prescription.  He insists I come back for that.  He proceeds to then say I need to come back THREE more times and starts suggesting ways for me to make a reason for my PCP to give me a referral.  I'm just too upset to even know what to do.  I should have held my ground, but it was intimating.  I mean, I tried to bring up what I needed, and the guy flat out refused me.  I called my HMO and they were uniformly unhelpful so I called back my doctor and insisting on getting a prescription saying I didn't know when I could come back due to work demands.  They were also unhelpful but acted like they'd see if he could mail it to me.  Its all so frustrating.  It was supposed to be a simple little eye exam and its just left me feeling helpless and frustrated.  I don't appreciate someone taking $15 from me and gosh knows what from my HMO just to make me wait 90 minutes for a 5 minute exam that wasn't even complete.  And I expected my HMO to be more interested in a doc trying to extort additional visits from a patient, since they are paying more of that then I am.  The only good thing is I had this appointment this week because my annual eye exam is done by calendar year so I can get another as of next week and have it paid for.  They better, anyway.  I'm also going to talk to my employers insurance agent (who is not an employee of the HMO but an independant guy who handles a lot of accounts with them) and see if he can do anything since he specifically said that's what he was there for.  Wish me luck.

      Okay, so I finally saw Shallow Hal, only about 2 years after it was released.  Quite a hot-button issue in the fat community with a lot of people making judgements sight unseen, myself included.  You know what?  We were right, and we didn't need to watch this garbage to know that.  Everything that upset people at the time was entirely accurate.  The only problem was that some people expected us to be won over by the heartfelt ending.  They refused to admit that we had a right to see it as condesending and insulting.  I'm sorry, but "I love you anyway" just doesn't feel quite as nice as "I love you" no matter how much you want it, too.  The movie's producers seem to be missing a point even made in the movie.  Just because a conditional love is offered doesn't mean a fat person won't see through it.  Still, the real devil is in the details.  Oh, forget the absurd sight-gags that really upset me before I saw the film.  The just plain stupid attention to detail is what really irked me.  They actually seemed to have the Rosemary character down at a couple points, but the character kept contradicting herself.  I mean, we do see her being realistically self-conscious when showing off her lingerea to Hal, and that felt very honest.  But, the scene before she is being the same way about wearing hot-pants and a belly shirt in front of her parents.  I mean, I understand where the character is coming from, but I also don't get why a self-apologizing fat person would even own hot pants or a bikini.  They made her apologetically fat when it was convenient and uncompramisingly fat when it was convenient.  There was just no consistancy.  I'd have found it all much more satisfying if her character had been more defiant and self-confident.  Or, at least give us reason to think Hal is giving her such self-confidence.  I just didn't see that developed, so it all felt pieced together.   And honestly, 1 boyfriend?  I mean, I know it happens, but still, its not that common either, is it?  Again, the movie just promotes a ghetoization of fat people rather than challenging those perceptions.  It pretends to be unconventional, but only after it makes time to acknowledge all the conventions.  Heck, even the Peace Corps was a stupid plot point, since they actually wouldn't allow a woman like Rosemary to participate.   I know the Peace Corps was really just a punch line, but its a reminder of just how shut out fat people are.  And I still can't get around the "in spite of" ending.  Give us something.  Some acknowledgement that there ARE people who would honestly find Rosemary beautiful.  We're here.  Get used to it.  But no, she's doomed to "in spite of" and told to be happy about it.  All the movie really does, then, is to defend the status quo and only dare to suggest the perfectly conventional message.  Safe, perhaps, but nothing edgy about.  Just more of the same.  Give me "Inclusive of" any day over "In spite of".

      I have a couple weeks off to celebrate the season.  Going home for a week and then just hanging around for a week.  Should be a nice relaxation.  Work has been very stressful for a couple months and it hasn't helped that I've been sick off and on.  Lots of little frustrations, too.  It doesn't help that my girlfriend's been so busy with buying a house that I've hardly seen her for weeks.  And even before that, we had a stretch of about two months where we were alternatingly sick.  Not like I haven't seen her, its just not the full girlfriend experience.  But, its understandable.  Just not helping with the stress.  But, I get to go home and play with my dad's big screen television and computer.  Generally not do much.  And that's not bad.  So Merry December to you all, and you can still comment with an email to get my online Christmas Card.  Hope life holds you well.  Opps.  I forgot I've been using lower-case in my titles.  Good thing I can fix that. hehe

      I really REALLY  REALLY  feel bad for any children or young adults who get subjected to a  urlLink Kidz Bop  CD or video.  Have you seen the commercials for these crimes against nature?  Basically, they take pop songz and santize them by way of having them sung by kidz who can't really sing, but you hope no one notices if you get enough of them together to sing in a very large group.  Judging by the video, these are those disturbing children that I'm pretty sure are produced by Disney in labs.  You know, those bland, attractive in that manufactured to specificationz way, who've clearly been bred for acting in Disney movies.  I'm guessing the Kidz Bop kidz are the rejectz from the Disney factories who are bought wholesale.  All very disturbing.  My favorite Reese's Limited Edition flavor (check out my first post for more), White Chocolate, is back for good.  I'm so psyched.  I can stop hording the White Chocolate miniatures now!  I think the Inside Outs are now perminant, too, but I didn't really care for those.  The flavor balance is just all out of whack.  Has anyone else noticed the subtle fat hatred in those Jazzy ads for Chili's restaurants?  You know, the ones with some "regular person" singing about Chili's in some style of music.  There are about 4 of them, and they all follow the same pattern.  Start with a wide shot of regular person singing.  Cut to food.  Cut to regular person at the restaurant with friends.  Logo.  Close up of regular person signing.  All except one.  That one happens to have a fat woman as the regular person.  It skips the at restaurant with friends and the close-up.  It only has the wide-shot.  It all seems kind suspect to me.  I mean, its JUST the fat woman who doesn't get the close-up out of all the ads.  That seems too convenient to me.  Meh.  I'm all done with my Christmas shopping.  Yay!  Woo hoo!  Not that I'm a last minute type, but I have a nasty tendancy to fret about gifts so much that I don't even have them come Christmas.  I freak myself out much more then necessary.  I had a brief period of panic that I was going to do that again and just got something impulsive for my girlfriend.  But its something.  Its the thought that counts, not the overthinking.  Speaking of my girlfriend, I'm now dating a home-owner.  Again, woo hoo!  And, also, that's kinda scary.  Not as scary as when I first found out an exgirlfriend was married.  And that happened when I was 20!  I don't have many ex's either.  hehe  Red Sox fans are the most self-important, self-absorbed sports fans around.  They don't deserve a World Series victory, and I hope they never get one and that every star player their turn on gets one.  Already happened with Roger Clemmens and Wade Boggs and Mo Vaughn had a near miss.  Looks like Nomar gets to be the next to try to show-up the team and fans which responded to his loyalty and unfailing dedication by treating him like dirt.  Oh, that's right, no one here cares about sports.  I'm sending out an online Christmas Card this year.  Respond to this message with your email if you want to get one.  Unless you already got it.  That is all.

      Final designs for the Freedom Tower complex in NYC were  urlLink unvailed today.   Still not sure what I think about them.  Some of the renderings make it look stunningly dramatic and others make it look underwhelming.  I should preface this by saying that I personally thought they should rebuild the towers as they were.  Aside from being a nice big FU to the people responsible for the destruction of the WTC, I actually liked how they looked.  I know architects slammed them, but there was just something about their simplicity and bluntness that really worked in the urban environment.  In cities, we always see buildings shoe-horned to fit the surroundings.  That was actually an artistic conceit of the Hancock Tower in Boston, which I actually like a lot.  Still, there was something refreshingly defiant about the Twin Towers.  Not only did they have the balls to build a big box in the biggest city on Earth, they went and built another right next to it.  They demanded attention.  Which, no doubt, is what made it an attractive target as well.  As stunning as the Freedom Tower appears to be, part of the design seems intended to deflect attention. A VERY significant part of its upper struction looks skelatal, which has the effect of making the Towers seem transparent.  Like its trying not to be notice.  Something just doesn't sit right with me about that.  I don't like the idea of us trying to bind ourselves in the face of threats.  I am encouraged by the idea of standing front and center.  It projects strength, perminance.  As beautiful as the Freedom Tower is, it seems like an effort at camoflage.  Pretending nothing was every really there to begin with.  Actually, I'm most initially impressed by the sister structures which occupy the Trade Center land.  Towering about as high as the meaningful part of the main tower, they also rise above the buildings around it.  The slanting roofs make for a powerful addition to the skyline from the Statue of Liberty.  But, the execution will be key.  Maybe the computers are ghosting the top of the tower too much, and it will really be a visible and tangible proof of the tower's reach towards the sky.  Maybe the companion buildings will be colored drably so they don't make as potent an addition as they might.  But, its all interesting, and I'm eager to see it proceed, even if its not what I would have liked to see.

      It seems that the No. 2 fugative in the world has been caught as we dragged a bearded  urlLink Saddam Hussain  out of a hole.  A couple of thoughts...  Damn good we got him alive.  It frustrated me to no end the way we murdered his sons.  Not that they are good people, but that they could have led us to their father and provided other valuable information.  Oh yeah, and be brought to justice the old fashioned way.  Instead, we sent an absurd ammount of manpower into a residential neighborhood rather than wait them out.  This left the disturbing prospect that we were either lied to about Iraq's WMD threat or that the one man who would know where they were was still out there.  Guess that last one is crossed off the list, as long as he didn't supply anyone else with the info in the 8 months it took to catch him.  That's another thing, 8 months?  And he wound up being exactly where we always thought he'd be?  Am I missing something here?  Why did it take this long when he was still out by his hometown?  Finally, one thing keeps popping into my head every time I hear this refered to as perhaps the most extensive manhunt in history.  I hinted at this in my opening.  This better not be the most extensive manhunt in history, because there is someone out there we need to catch even more and we've been actively after him for over a year longer than Hussain.  Remember what started the whole War on Terror?  Wasn't Saddam.  It was someone else who is apparently still out there and  urlLink well funded to boot.   But we caught Saddam.  So I guess the administration is hoping people will forget about what really started this and how we never did catch the No. 1 fugative.

      Sorry.  I know I haven't posted here in forever.  December is my busiest time at work, especially last weekend.  I actually worked both days during the Blizzard.  Wheeee!  And apparently people in Massachusetts completely freak out in the face of snow, buying bread like they are getting trapped for winter.  But, I keep thinking of things to write about, really.  I just usually collapse long before I can get around to writing them.  So what finally inspired my return to the blog?  Me being pissed of.  Sorry to do this to you, but my friend at work has left early and my girlfriend is busy buying a house and out of range for me to bitch to, so you get stuck with it.  People really suck sometimes.  I went to lunch today.  I was only buying lunch because I've been too exhausted and sick to get into work on time, much less make a sandwich on the way here.  So, I went out for pizza.  My favorite place, unfortunetly, was out of Sicilian which is the only stuff they do right, so rather then wait for hot sicilian (which is not that good to begin with, and would be undercooked because that's what they do when someone is waiting) I went next door to a lesser pizza joint with higher prices.  Not much higher, but considering a better place is right next door it still strikes me as pretty ballsy.  Anyway, I get my pizza, and they stick two pieces of Sicilian on a paper plate.  Not a great set-up, but whatever.  Problem is, some guy is crowding me to begin with and as I'm trying to get off to a table, he bumps me causing me to drop the pizza.  So there is $5 wasted.  An accident, sure, but caused by him crowding me to begin with.  The real kicker is, the guy doesn't even acknowledge any of this.  Acts like its all on TV or something and didn't involve him.  Doesn't apologize at all, even after I glared at him.  Really pissed me off.  Mostly, though, because I'm not out $5.  I spend money on some frivilous things, but I utterly hate wasting money.  Drives me insane.  Really just bothers me very deeply.  Not sure why, because its not like I'm a spend-thrift.  I just like getting my money's worth on things, and getting litterally nothing just doesn't sit right at all with me.  It just leaves me completely crest-fallen and upset.  So, that's what just happened to me.  Sorry to stick you with it, but I had to get it out to someone.  Stay tuned for something better later.  I promise.

      I had a BIG MOMENT last night.  One of those signs of adulthood.  Probably one of the last I will experience, actually, as I'm really getting a touch too old to have any Adult Firsts.  But at least one was left.  I got my first Christmas Tree on my own.  Woo hoo!  Out of college, I lived with my now ex-girlfriend and she had a fake tree which predated me and I never really felt was mine and besides, was fake.  Last year, I opted not to get a tree since I was not on good terms with my roommate and my now girlfriend had one at her place anyway.  She  lent me a little fake tree which suited my needs, anyhow.  But this year, there is no fall back.  My girlfriend is probably not getting a tree at all since she will be moving just before Christmas.  I have big living room just begging for a tree.  I thought about getting a fake one, but one wiff of the massive wreathes in my office building's lobby convinced me that I needed a real tree.  I'll be decorating it tonight.  I have lights which I used to decorate my windows last year and picked up some ornaments at le Boutique Target.  Have to let the branches drop first, of course.  Which is essentially all I know about Christmas trees.  Its a nice looking sucker.  Not too big, but nicely full.  I'm all excited.  I woke up and the pine scent was just all over the place.  Gotta love the real deal.  And I've always been a sucker for room's lit by Tree lights.  Its one of those enduring childhood memories that always moves me.  I can't wait.  The funny thing, of course, is that I'm celebrating Christmas at all.  I'm religious non-committed, after all, being an agnostic.  Just goes to show how secularized the holiday has become.  Although, I've always been a sucker for the Charlie Brown Christmas special precisely because it is so religious.  I am not be of faith, but I have tremendous respect for those who are and do it right, encouraging others not by bluster or force but by living as examples of the teachings of their faith.  The Charlie Brown special is doing it right.  Reminding us what Christmas really means, both if religious and secular terms.  Its one of only a handful of Christmas specials which is explicitly anti-consumerism, and you have to love that.  Even The Grinch can't quite claim to be that as its more interested in stripping away the artifice to show the true meaning.  That's not quite the same thing as Chuck's explicit condemnation of consumpsion celebrating.  And I respect the hell out of how they do it.  Painting Christmas without Santa and Rudolph and Snowman but rather with the hope of the Savior.  Christmas get's slagged for being an unimportant religious holiday, but Charlie Brown provides an important rebutal to that line.  But, I can't say I went with Chuck's choice of trees when I got my $40 Air Freshener.  At least's not some weird color or made of aluminum or (shudder) inflatable.

      It seems the Pentagon is considering battlefield use of the  urlLink Segway Human Transporter.     Haven't we put the men and women of our armed forces through enough?  Those are those bizarre little two wheel scooters that balance themselves in some complicated and ingenious way that you don't quite understand but is supposedly one of the most brilliant inventions ever even though it looks kinda goofy and no one can actually imagine people using the darn things.  Supposedly, its virtually impossible to fall off the thing.  Although  urlLink our President  seems to have managed to fall off the un-fall off-able Segway.  (Seems he forgot to turn it on)  But our soldiers?  In battle?  Do we really need to spend the millions you just know we are spending to figure out that a battlion of Marines puttering around on scooters is not likely to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy.  Somehow, I just can't picture some exciting and inspiring military combat video game involving scooting about.  And for that matter, what the heck is with all of these exciting and inspiring military combat video games?  They seem to be all over the place.  Forget the handful of blatent exploitations of the Iraq war.  I'm talking about the combat simulators, usually either based in modern day urban warfare situation or in World War II.  There just seems to be so many of them.  I understood it to a point, butthere is a point when it just feels like too much.  My dad is into them, and he actually served in the armed forces.  Okay, he served in the Navy and JFK and John Kerry notwithstanding, that's not really a combat activity, but it still seems weird that a vetern would be interested in playing pretend soldier.  Still, it seems a bit more understandable for him than for the majority who are playing the games who surely have never even been remotely in combat situations.  The weirdest are the games that do multiplayer "death-match" games in their real World War II.  That just freaks me out.  I mean, I can sorta wrap my head around doing honor to those who fought in defense of freedom in World War II against the Nazi's with video games which chronicle their couragous efforts.  Video games aren't just play anymore.  They are a way of archiving our culture, our history.  But using this as a backdrop to kill people over a high-speed connection just seems weird to me.  Oh, well.  I guess mine is not to question why.

      My girlfriend and I broke up tonight.  Her call, but I can't say I really had much to disagree with.  Its nice, but its been going nowhere fast.  And she's been a little testy with me lately, and didn't want it to get worse, which is certainly a good idea.  I was feeling about the same way, but I guess I was just hoping to get some of the nice times back again.  I felt like we weren't getting to be together much lately, and I missed that.  My one regret is that we weren't really able to get back there before calling it quits.  There was one night a couple weeks that was just really nice.  But, ultimately, all it ever got was nice.  Its sad, because its not like it was anything bad or really difficult.  But it was just nice.  Its a weird feeling.  I mean, a lot of me is really sad, but also releaved that she said it and I didn't have to.  It just confused me.  Its not easy to break up with someone just because its only nice.  But, better to break up now before we get to a point where we resent each other.  So, here I am.  Single again, and again worried.  Took a quick glance at online personals and was quickly depressed at the "full figured but working on it" posts.  Finding someone who is into fat acceptance isn't easy.  I really loathe the BBW Dance scene.  They've gotten so that you've got many more women focused on weight loss than not, and that's just depressing.  Not to mention the fact that I tend to be shy when I meet people, and don't really have a circle of friends in Boston to go to a BBW dance with.  Even there, I can't feel like a woman is going to really want to be with an FA.  But its a little early to get fatalistic, I imagine.  Oh well.

      So, I think I mentioned a while back that I've pondering the future of this blog.  My posting has dwindled a lot lately, for a variety of reasons.  Just busy for one.  Also, I'm frankly not interested in posting somewhere where I'm just going to get harrassed by some troll who got here from some fat hate site.  Like, say, NAAFA.  Primarily, though, I'm concerned about pleasing my audience.  I know somethings interest people more than others.  Lately, I've been very interested in politics and have posted about it a lot, but a lot less than I wanted.  Sometimes, I want to post about baseball or the football playoffs, but I know you guys don't care about that.  This also keeps me from promoting this site.  I have a link at the fat related sites I post, but not other ones, because I'm too concerned about the inconsistant focus.  I mean, I'd like readers, but I know I'll just turn off a sports fan with a lengthy post about John Edwards.  And as to political sites I visit, are they necessarily going to give a damn about non-political fat issues as an introduction?  So, what do I do?  Decide to focus on one subject?  That'd make sense, but I've never been good at concentrating on one goal.  I always want them all.  So, I'm thinking I might just start several new blogs to post on my interested subjects.  I figure I'd have 4.  One for fat issues, one for politics, one for sports, and one for pop-cult stuff.  I'm thinking about keeping this blog as a kind of clearinghouse for all posts, and obviously some stuff would be cross posted.  My pimping for Romeo Void's appearance on Bands Reunited is both fat related and pop-cult focused, for instance.  I'm thinking this might actually get me posting more, because I'll be less concerned about turning off my audience and could actually bother to, you know, GET an audience beyond a couple friends.  Just a thought for now.  Actually, that was my original idea for a site before I started my blog.  I wanted a site to post my writing with defined sections for various topics.  Of course, I'm the king of unfufilled projects.  Already setting myself up for one as I've started writing a graphic novel I know I'll probably do nothing with, even though I've already bothered to come up with a three-year story arc.  Mid-to-late 20's angst, I guess.  You know, the feeling that I want to persue all my hopes and dreams, and the nagging feeling that I dropped the ball by not doing more to persue them when I was 20.  All sorts of missed opportunites due to spreading myself to thin.  (which, of course, is what I'm proposing now, but lets not confuse this discussion with logic)  Wishing I was more dedicated to singing or acting in high school.  Contradicting that wish by wishing I was quicker to give up on performing and concentrating on developing myself as a writing.  Wishing I was Communications major in college.  Wishing I bothered to learn how to really draw instead of learning how to do some really good sketches but missing some key skills.  Wishing I tried to developing my comic side so I could have been a comedy writer.  Wishing I knew how I could start persuing any of this now.  Wishing I knew what I want to do with my life.  Lots of wishing.  I'm actually optimistic about that graphic novel, but I always get like that and never follow through.  But, maybe I'm wrong.  I've got this weird thing where I'm a pessimistic optimist.  Ah, well.

      That damn roaming gnome commercial is addictive.  Every time I hear about how things have gone "doddy bonkers", I get hypnotised.  Must listen to the droll British guy.  Must learn about whoopsie daisies.  Must travel with Travelocity.

      Hey, remember when I used to post silly little pop cult things and people actually read this blog?  Lets try that again...  I haven't been to the movies for a couple months.  My girlfriend hurt herself when moving into her new house and has been slow to recover.  A consequence is that she can't really sit for very long so movies have been out of the question.  So, I'm getting a bit pent up with movies I want to see, so I figured I'd give my thoughts about 4 movies I haven't seen but want to.   Return of the King  In spite of my geek tendancies, the  Lord of the Rings  triology was one bit of geekiness I never got into.  (Never played D&D, either; I guess the whole fantasy geek thing missed me)  So, I've been encountering the movies as a first-timer.  I must say, I'm impressed.  The movies have been really engaging and exciting.  I actually skipped the first one in the theaters because I was fairly disinterested, but when I saw it on DVD, I was looking forward to the second film.  Since then, I've been eager for the finale.  Obviously, it'll be in the theaters for a while more since its the Oscar front-runner, but it'll still be the first film I want to see.   Big Fish  I'm a fairly big Tim Burton fan, so I'm also eager for this movie.  It looks great and I've heard plenty of good things.  Ewan McGreggor and Albert Finney are both always good, so that's a plus.  And it looks like Burton's film that finally gets him some attention.  (Which really should have been  Ed Wood )  Anyway, it has all the elements of a movie I'll enjoy, so its a strong #2 on my list of films to see.   Win a Date with Tad Hamilton  Here is one I'm not so sure about, so I'm wondering if anyone's seen it.  I'm a big fan of Topher Grace.  It seems like a sweet little romantic comedy with a mildly antiquated concept.  I'll probably end up just renting it, because it doesn't have a real must-see vibe to it, but if I hear really good things I might change my mind.   The Butterfly Effect  Yes, Ashton Kutchner's movie.  I know, I know.  But maybe he is a decent actor who just hasn't gotten a good part to show it.  The concept is very interesting to the geek in me.  Time Travel is a cool concept, and the idea of a time travel movie where all time travel ever does is seriously screw everything up.  It does, aparently, have a plot line which I know will really freak me out as it deals with one my admittedly irrational but overwhelming fears, but it also has Ethan Suplee, who's always cool.  (I actually just got an action figure of Suplee for his character from Mallrats)  He's a great actor (and supposedly a very cool guy, too) but he's never really gotten his due.  It's almost surreal that they are mentioning him by name in the commercials.  So, that's it for now.  Just laying low this weekend.  Turned 26 on Friday.  Whee.  Hope all is well out there in cyberspace.

      Okay, I have decided to make an endorsement in the Democratic Nominations for President.  Yeah, I know you don't care, but I'm doing it anyway.  I've been going back and forth between Kerry and Edwards for a while.  I do respect Kerry, but some of his campaigning has annoyed me.  Although I voluneteer and raised money for his senate campaign in 1996, I was having a hard time pulling the trigger on supporting him.  Especially since I kept getting nagged by John Edwards.  I've liked him for a while.  I like his story.  I like ideas.  I like his positivity and his optimism.  He basically had me sold with his great Two Americas commercials, but I still worried that no one else would pick up on Edwards and I'd just be supporting a lost cause.  Back in 1992 (when I was all of 14 and WAY too interested in the election), my candidates kept dropping out.  It got very discouraging.  First I liked Bob Kerry.  Then Tsongus.  Then Brown.  I even flirted with Perot, briefly, before coming to my senses.  Just didn't want to get my hopes on Edwards.  I was actually resigning myself to nominee Dean.  Then Iowa happened.  Suddenly, both of my guys were highly viable.  It seemed Edwards was really communicating well.  Basically, I knew it wasn't just me.  So, I thought about it for a couple days, and I've decided I'm going to throw in and do what I can to support Edwards.  Being a hopeless in debt (college loans, not credit cards, thank goodness) 20-something who works for a non-profit, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to give much to his campaign.  I want to wait and give to the general election, since I think I'll only be able to make a small donation.  But, I'm going to volunteer to do what I can.  He's a good candidate, and I'd really like to see him win.  So, here I am.  Endorsing John Edwards.  I promise to try to stop talking about politics.  But before I do,  urlLink read this.   It's beyond disgusting, but something we need to raise hell about.  My newspaper actually broke the story, but if its not in your paper tomorrow morning in a big way, let them know that you are upset they are ignoring such an important story.  And remember how much we heard about non-stories like Whitewater and Travel-gate.  Here is a honest to God Watergate redux, complete with Republican underlings stealing Democrat's files.  This should be a no-brainer for the press.  We need to know what happened here, and people who broke the law need to be brought to answer for their crimes.

      Big ups to  urlLink Al Franken  for pointing this line out from the SOTU from W.  Like I said, I don't need to be lied to on my Tuesday Night.  How Bush can say this with a straight face is just beyond me.  They have no conception of criticism.  They act like it doesn't exist.  They act like the consequences of their actions are non-existant.  It's just mind blowing.  Anyway, here is what W. said...  "For diplomacy to be effective, words must be credible - and no one can now doubt the word of America."  From the Washington Post on Monday.  MONDAY!  As in the day BEFORE the SOTU.   urlLink Arms Issue Seen as Hurting U.S. Credibility Abroad

      I want to again plug the Romeo Void episode of  Bands Reunited  on VH1.  It was just a great episode which handed everything so well.  It delt with Debora's size in an honest and respectful manner that was just so great to see.  It was a lot of fun to watch and I just wish we got more concert video.  I suggested to some others that if the series is a hit, VH1 might run the concerts.  Wishful thinking, I know.  Maybe a DVD release, though.  More than my personal interest in this episode, I'm really liking what I've seen from the series.  It could have been a real kitsch fest, but it genuinely isn't.  It's part Behind the Music, part Where are They Know, and part Reunion Tour.  For all of the gimmick of the show's set-up, it works because the host is so sincere and genuine.  This isn't meant to be some off-shoot of "I Love the 80's".  It comes off as a real reflection upon the great bands of the 80's and a study in personalities of those involved.  Honest, but positive, and giving a full appraisal of all of the band members.  The two episodes so far have actually focused more on the non-lead singers, which is a real kick to see.  They really respect the idea of the band and the episodes also serve to educate people about why bands are more than their front men/women.  I'm already hooked on the first two episodes, and highly recommend it.  I'm mildly concerned about what happens when the Reunion doesn't work.  It has to come up at some point.  That's got to be pay-off of the series.  It can't all be positive.  I wonder how that will effect the genuine spirit of the show.  But I'm cautiously optimistic.  Its just so much fun and a really neat show for the pop-cult network, VH1.

      One quick comment about the SOTU from W.  (which I didn't watch; I don't need to sit around and be lied to on my Tuesday nights)  Remember all of those scary WMD's Bush loudly proclaimed last year?  Think he'd just avoid the issue this year?  Pretend it didn't happen?  Of course not.  Because W. exists in a universe where he can do no wrong and reality will bend to his every word.  So he actually BRAGGED about what they found.  You know, the NOTHING they found.  He bragged about it.  Didn't call it nothing, of course.  What did he boast about finding in Iraq?  Weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.  I guess after their over-predictions of last year, now they'll just qualify the hell out of everything and pretend it means something.  Because we found ourselves some weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.  Weapons of Mass Destruction?  Well, no.  WMD programs?  Not that either.  WMD activities?  Nope.  But we did get us some weapons of mass destruction-related program activities.   urlLink Like this.   Yep.  And that, of course, was Blatent lying-related program activities.

      So, the Democratic Nomination has just become a race.  Count me as a little surprised.  I'd spent the last few weeks coming to terms with Howard Dean as my candidate, and now my two favored candidates have turned up the heat.  Its looking like John Kerry will win Iowa.  Not only that, but he's going to win with 15% more support than he was polling.  This is huge for a campaign which was looking dead in the water, like, a week ago.  What's more, the second place finish is going to John Edwards, who came from even further back and also had 15% more support than he was polling.  (In fairness, though,  urlLink the caucus system is not a primary,  so polling is not an accurate way to measure predicted results).  I'm really stunned at how this turned out.  Word is, Edwards did a media blitz in Iowa and really changed a lot of minds.  Kerry has always been in a strong position, and the buzz has it that some good ads articulating his position on keep middle class tax cuts while rollbacking cuts on the wealthy positioned him well to capitalize on Dean's fade.  He's actually found a very effective way to be a Democratic anti-tax candidate.  I'm amazed by its simplicity and obviousness.  The points have been made before, sure, but never so forthrightly and emphatically.  The message could destroy the Republican anti-tax advantage, too, since it exposes their weakness by focusing on corporate loopholes.  As he said in his acceptance speech tonight, the tax code has added tens of thousands of pages in loopholes, but you can bet the average American doesn't have a page for them.  Dean not only didn't win and didn't finish second, but he wasn't even a close third.  That's got to scare him.  Even more disappointing, though, was Dick Gephardt.  Not long ago, he was thought to be the only person who could keep Dean down in Iowa.  Even then, a Gephardt victory wouldn't have meant much since he put all his chips into winning Iowa and wasn't fooling anyway into thinking he was a viable candidate.  He's now a VERY distant fourth and strongly considering dropping out of the race.  Actually, before I even finished this, Gephardt HAS dropped out.  Graham and Mosley-Braun called it quits before votes were cast (not counting the pretend primary in Washington, DC).  Kucinich and Sharpton won't survive New Hampshire, in all likelyhood.  Lieberman will probably quit then, too.  Which means we'll have a much more compact 5 person race   If not 4.  Kerry's strong showing is a major blow to Wes Clark's campaign.  His strong polling in New Hampshire could disappear.  If he falls back to single digits, he could easily drop out, too.  But what about after New Hampshire?  The Super Seven primaries come on February 3.  Lieberman and Sharpton might survive NH, but this will be their final test.  The primaries in South Carolina, Arizona, North Dakota, Missouri, Delaware, New Mexico, and Oklahoma could be the biggest thinning out period for the field.  Dean still has a big lead in organization and money, so it will take a major blow in New Hampshire to really shake him leading into the Super Seven.  Indeed, because he's lead NH for so long, he doesn't need to win it so much, anymore.  Just look at W. in 2000.  He was beaten badly in NH, but shrugged it off by destroying McCain in South Carolina.  At least check, here is how those states are going...  Delaware (15 delagates) Dean has a strong lead in the last poll, with Clark polling strong and Sharpton running third.  Kerry and Edwards are pretty far back, and unlikely to pull ahead.  Lieberman is putting a lot into Delaware, something Steve Forbes did in 2000.  It might win him the primary, but it'll be a hollow victory that will just delay the inevitable.  Missouri (74) Gephardt, obviously, has a huge lead here, so this race will change dramatically.  Given Kerry's big lead in Iowa, he'd have to be an early favorite now.  SC (45) With Edwards big bounce, he should do well here.  Dean had been gaining steam, but should be vulnerable now.  Sharpton and Clark are also polling well, here, though, so it's anyone's race.  If Edwards doesn't win, though, his campaign may be over.  AZ (55) Clark is polling strong here, already, so he can probably really take advantage of Dean.  Kerry is so far back that he'll need a big win in New Hampshire to gain much ground here.  NM (26) Dean and Clark are out ahead, but not by much.  Kerry or Edwards or even Lieberman could easily make a strong run here.  OK (40) Dean and Clark are way out ahead, but with plenty of undecideds.  Given it's demographics, Edwards should be well poised to jump.  ND (14) I can't find any info for North Dakota.  I'll take a wild guess, though.  Dean is leading and Clark is coming on strong.  So, this is all to say, it's still very much a race and Dean is not the candidate of destiny he once was.  Is this good or bad for Dems?  Common line is bad, since more money will be spent in primaries than in the general election.  I'm not sure I buy that.  I mean, that money is spent increasing visability.  As long as they can eventually return to positive points, it could well energize people to vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is.  But, we'll have to wait and see.  Iowa just threw a major wrench in the process.

      Just wanted to pimp for something I think a lot of my readers will be interested in.  Coming this Tuesday as part of VH1's Bands Reunited series they'll be doing an episode on the 80's band  urlLink Romeo Void.   Why should you care about Romeo Void?  Debora Iyall, that's why.  Forgeting for a moment that Romeo Void had some of the most exciting and daring lyrics and music of the day (and even more so compared to the cookie-cutter pop of today), lyricist and lead singer Dee Iyall is one of the few real life fat pop stars.  Watching a video of the band on their VH1 site is almost unbelievable.  They may have been able to hide Carnie Wilson in her videos, but there is no way to avoid a lead singer completely.  Seeing a fat woman in that setting is so far outside one's experience.  I've loved what I have heard of Romeo Void and look forward to getting to see them in concert as part of special.  Iyall, by the way, is very fat positive.  She designed the original logo for Fat!So? and did the photography on perhaps the two most recognizable "Anatomy Lessons" from Fat!So?: Belly and Butt.  Unquestionably someone worth supporting and I'd encourage all of my readers to spread the word about her appearance on VH1's Bands Reunited this Tuesday at 10pm (Eastern) with her band Romeo Void.

      You know, I support space exploration, and even I have a hard time with Bush's plea for a Mars mission and a Moon mission redux.  His explanation just rang completely hallow.  Even I know that space exploration is a bit of a waste of money.  Why rush off to spend billions on a project that last I checked wasn't something we could really do?  Oh, that's right.  Aerospace contracts.  Don't you just love how synergy works?  The folks at NASA are probably too blinded by the money to really ask themselves what is to be gained by going back to the moon and trying to go to Mars.  They're good people, but let's face facts.  They want to do anything in space.  You offer them money to do it, and they won't say no.  Doesn't mean its really the best use of our extra-terrestrial exploration funds.  Bush did himself no favors in his pitch by basically bad-mouthing the Mars rover mission that's actually happening NOW.  I mean, that's just rude.  To trash talk about something the government you're running is doing right now.  Show some class.  Especially since his reasoning was so suspect.  He trashed the rover because we humans need to see things for ourselves.  The kind of work of the rover (which he didn't mention specifically, but clearly was referencing) was just not enough, according to Bush.  I just don't think that is necessarily true.  A lot of space exploration has been thinly vailed public relations stunts.  It was when Kennedy proposed it, and I can't help but think it is now, too, that Bush is trying to channel JFK by setting an ambitious plan for space exploration.  Thing is, I don't think Bush's ideas will be able to pan out.  But this was the guy who also came up with calling astronauts to bizarre term "spacial entrepreneurs".  Seriously.  "Spacial entrepreneurs".  Says it right their on Whitehous.gov.  Go ahead and google that.  Seems W. is the FIRST person to ever utter "spacial entrepreneurs".  I know, you're shocked.  The whole tenor of his speech was disturbingly unilateral.  My impression of the PR aspects of the original moon missions is that we talked about them being for all mankind, and left the world to understand that this was the United States on the moon.  Well, planting the flag was less than subtle, but it was also pure symbolism.  We didn't say it outright like Bush is doing now.  This isn't about all of humanity.  This is about what America is gonna do.  Such a bald plea for attention isn't likely to do much for our image.  And strictly speaking, Bush's challenge is remarkably underwhelming.  Kennedy promissed a man on the moon in 10 years.  It was an absurd suggestion in 1960, but sure enough we got there.  Bush is proposing to put a man on the moon in 2020.  He doesn't even dare suggest a timetable for Mars, probably because he realizes that it'd just be talk and nothing more.  Which is another thing that annoys me.  He brought up Mars purely to capitalise on the attention given a mission he took the time to dismiss and to get headlines that he knew his 16 years to get back to where we once belonged would get.  It was craven and fake.  But whenever those brave spacial entrepreneurs get there, guess we'll have to hear Bush's cheap PR ploy.

      "No President has ever done more for human rights than I have."-  urlLink George W. Bush   Now, if you don't hear this absurdly over-reaching boast repeated often (or at all) over the next few days (weeks, months, etc.) then you'll know just what a "liberal" press we have in this country.  And yet the Republican encouraged lies about Al Gore saying he invented the internet are STILL being repeated.

      Sorry, I know I haven't posted for a week.  I'm afraid I've been sick and the only thing which sufficiently inspired me was the Baseball Hall of Fame voting, and I know you guys don't care about that so no reason to waste all of our time.  Which actually inspired another topic, but I'm still thinking about that.  But I wanted to write something.  I've been reading politics blogs for a few days.  Specifically,  urlLink Talking Points Memo  and  urlLink Atrios.   Which largely leaves me feel incapable of adding anything useful to the discussion of reading their stuff.  But one thing prompted me.   urlLink The New Republic  endorsed Joe Lieberman?  Seriously?  Lieberman?  Look, I thought Lieberman was an acceptable if flawed VP candidate back in 2000.  Yeah, he was conservative, but it balanced out Gore's liberal credentials.  Until, of course, some people decided to pretend Gore had no liberal credentials and others tried to pretend Lieberman did.  He was a balance for the ticket, but no someone I'd vote for on his own.  Al Gore seems to agree.  He's too conservative to energize the party's core.  Its just that simple.  And everyone knows it, which is why he won't get the nod.  He's not going to get a majority.  Not even in his own state.  He's dead in the water.  That's why Gore wasn't worried about pissing him off by endorsing Dean.  What on EARTH is TNR thinking?  I thought they were a liberal publication anyway.  Do they know who Joe Lieberman is?  Hey, you don't have to like Dean, but why not stelth-Dem Wes Clark?  Or nuanced policy wonk John Kerry?  Or as long as we're picking people who can't win, what's wrong with principled and charasmatic moderate John Edwards who is much more the natural decendant of Clinton dems than Joe can ever hope to be.  Don't get me wrong.  I'd vote for Joe if he was my party's nominee.  But I don't need to worry about that.  What's worse about the futility of the endorsement is the way TNR belittled Dean to the point of making it seem like they'd endore Bush if Dean won the election.  Their whole approach seems to miss the point of the primary season.  Solidfy support from the liberal base and then make the mainstream appeal after.  Gore forgot that in 2000 and it killed him.  Bush didn't.  Remember him sucking up to Bob Jones U?  Dean, love him or hate him, has energized a lot of people who wouldn't be participating in the process.  And he has the credentials to establish himself as a mainstream candidate.  He's not McGovern, for crying out loud.  I'm really getting sick of people in my party treating him like that, because they're doing damage.  I still don't know who has my vote.  I'm still not all that impressed with Dean but I'll probably vote for him in the primary.  Kerry has lost me completely and I'm still wary of Clark and his habit of voting Republican.  I'm mildy impressed with Edwards, but only mildly and no one seems to be with me on that.  Besides, I doubt he'll still be on the ballot when Mass gets to vote.  No one in hell I'm voting for Lieberman or Gephardt if they are still clinging on.  Not that I would, but Dennis, Al, and Carol will be long-gone so I'm not even worried about them.  Well, maybe not Al, but he'll be on life-support.  So, now that I've bored you all with politics, just remember.  I could have been talking about Paul Molitar.

      Well, its the New Year.  And you know what that means!  Being inundated by fucking diet ads on TV.  Next week is the Food Network's weight loss week.  *groan*  Well, the only good thing is that if you change the channel and hope it all goes away, it will.  The networks get the anti-fat crap out of their system in a couple weeks and even the hold-outs won't make it past February, which only leaves us with the chronic offenders, but we knew they'd be up to no good.  Another year, and another few million people being made to feel like failures for something they have no real control over.

      So, last week VH1 aired a special exploring television's portrayals of minorities.  Only, it was done in the fashion of their pop culture commentary shows like "I Love the (insert decade)" or "The Best Week Ever" or "TV's Secret Rules".  Basically, the usual array of second and third tier celebrities commenting irreverently with visual aids to show what they are talking about.  Only, it was also done very seriously.  Improbably enough, it worked.  In addition to the usual celebs, VH1 tossed in some more academic/intellectual voices.  Specifically, though, people who would take well to the loose style of the VH1 pop culture programming.  They explored a host of stereotypes and tracked their development.  They also discussed pretty much every racial minority.  Certainly, a lot of it focused on blacks, but there was a good deal of time spent on latino portrayals as well Asians and even native Americans.  A lot of it was framed with gimmicks, but never in a way which cheapened the discussion.  So when they played "What Race Am I?" it came off as challenging our expectations rather than some lame attempt to funny.  We saw discussions of white actors playing asians, a mention of how Star Trek shows have had a wildly disproportionate number of the few Asian regulars on TV shows, the effect of "white hero" style characters and how that evolved, and they even went into some of the crude racial stereotyping that used to be common in kids entertainment.  Very interesting to see what we used to show our kids.  They primarily focused on a Dick Tracy cartoon from the early 60's which featured two vicious ethnic stereotypes in the supporting cast in the form of Joe Jitsu and Go Go Gomez.  Although both were good guys, the portrayals were so insanely abusive that it was really shocking.  "Go Go Gomez" was largely a rip off of Speedy Gonzalez, as he was a lazy but incredibly fast Mexican.  It was much worse, though then the questionable taste of Speedy.  Jitsu looked like something out of a World War II era political propaganda cartoon.  Also discussed was the stereotypes seen in professional wrestling and how that has developed over the years, a fertile subject indeed.  All together, I felt the special really worked.  It was not an academic paper or anything, but it was still serious while being accessible.  Since VH1's decent into pop culture hell is pretty much unstopable at this point, its good to know they'll do a better job with the topic than the unwatchable E! network.

      I've really been on a Cartoon Network kick lately.  Its become the only network I reliably watch.  Its weird, too, because most of their programming doesn't interest me at all.  All the kiddie toons in the day are fine, but ultimately don't interest me.  Most of their anime bores me at best.  Seriously, does anyone understand Dragonball Z?  That show just weirds me out, and this is from someone who actually has a perverse appreciate for Pokemon.  But what CN has that I like, I like a lot.  Family Guy and Futurama continue to incredibly funny and eminantly watchable.  Cowboy Bebop is back on the schedule, which is great.  I finally watched the Bebop movie (which I've owned for months) and am continually impressed with the show.  Its so unlike most Anime.  Its all very naturalistic.  It imagines a world not that dissimiliar to our own, and the characters are all very human.   All trying to put on an image that they can never quite maintain.  Never mind the stylish directing.  And the Sunday night line-up is just pure gold.  Harvey Birdman is back and airing their episodes from the begining.  Seriously, watch it.  Sundays at 11:30 from not through June.  I mean it.  I'm also finally getting to enjoy "Home Movies", which has new episodes airing at 11pm on Sundays.  And dependanble goodness from the Aqua Teens, Space Ghost, etc. has made the Sunday [adult swim] block a favorite part of my TV week and something I genuinely look forward too, even when I know what's on.  I guess part of that is the brilliant bumps they show in commercial breaks.  Always funny.  It may not be as fresh as it first was, when out of no where they had these conversational and irreverantly honest pages of text in the breaks, but it's holding up.  They're also trying new things with the same sensibility.  For instance, all this week, they've been showing elaborately produced "Happy Hollidays" ads complete with amusingly cliche images of Christmas/Haunukah/Kwanzaa celebrations.  You know the kind of thing you see for a couple seconds on your local station for a Happy _____ spot.  Except they went way overboard with this doubtlessly liscensed video and made it a joke in and of itself.  But the best thing?  It's late February.  And no, its not part of one of those "Christmas in ______" network events.  Who does those in late February, anyway?  No, they just started running out nowhere with no explanation whatsoever.  I just love that.

      [adult swim] had one of the best episodes of [em]Futurama[/em] tonight: the Emmy Award winning "Roswell that Ends Well".  For the uninitiated, [em]Futurama[/em] is an elaborate parody of the sci-fi genre.  The premise being that a delivery boy gets himself chriogenically frozen and wakes up 1000 years into the future.  They use the premise to do all sorts of sci-fi comedy, but the show also had a lot more heart than people gave it credit for.  While it didn't have the family dynamic the protect it from its cynicism like The Simpsons, there is real honesty to the lead character Fry and his crush on the lead female character Leela.  They pulled out some amazingly emotional, honest, but funny cartoons involving his unrequited love and his feelings of detachment from his old life.  I'm really impressed at how they can so brilliantly capture some complex stuff and make it damn funny but touching at the same time.  Once or twice, its down right sad.  It takes a lot of guts to do a cartoon that has such a wide range of emotions, and I give them credit for that.  "Roswell that Ends Well" is not one of those emotional funny episodes, though.  It's pure screwball comedy and just hits all its marks.  I especially like that its a send-up of time-travel stories.  Indeed, it specifically parodies the obligatory time-travel episodes of so many sci-fi shows.  Lots of levels here.  It acknowledges all the usual time-travel cliches on its way to completely destroying them.  Naturally, Fry is admonished to avoid doing anything to affect the past in harsh tones.  Naturally, he screws things up.  How he screws up and the results, though, are pure comedic gold.  Much it revolves around the obligatory meeting of a relative, his grandfather.  Fry becomes insanely protective so as his grandfather doesn't die before he can have sex with his grandmother.  Its all the usual slapstick stuff, too, until the grandfather says the funniest line ever on the show....  "You ever get the feeling you're just going with girls cuz you're supp'sed to?"   The best part is the reaction shot of Fry.   Its this blank horror that is absolutely perfect for the scene.  I just love that line.  It manages to be sublte and blunt at the same time, the way it talks around the issue while still making the joke perfectly clear.  Its also the funniest take on insuring your eventual birth in a time travel story.  And the committment to the joke displayed with the few seconds of expressionless shock from Fry ties it all together.  Naturally, Fry does get his grandfather killed.  He then proceeds to get it on with his grandmother when he rationalizes that they must not be his grandparents since he didn't disappear when his grand-dad died.  Of course, this is faulty reasoning, so we end up with the most bizarre incest story even imagined that results in Fry being his own grandfather and earning the disgusted scorn from all of the other characters.  After so completely screwing up the timeline, the rest also decide to just go for broke and forget about protecting the past.  "Screw history" are the exact words.  Its just such a funny way to wrap up the story.  It obviously respects the sci-fi tradition in order to hit all these points, but its love is reflected in its unquenchable desire to pervert the traditions.  It has all the little touches, too.  The "explanation" for Roswell, Alien autoposy, even a little homage to the Hitchhiker's Guide (or Star Trek: TNG) with the robot getting buried in the past only to be recovered when everyone else ends up back in the future.  Just pure concentrated funny.  Its a real shame Futurama ended after only 4 seasons.

      I'm really posting up a storm tonight, aren't I?  Well, I was about to launch into three more posts, but I won't.  I'll deal with them tomorrow.  Or, um, latter today.  But I wanted to remind myself of what I want to write about, as well as give you all a preview...  VH1 adapted their irreverent pop culture commentary format to a serious issue (portrayals of minorities on tv) and it actually worked.  New England has this cool local television food critic,  The Phantom Gourmet  and I was curious if other areas of the country had something similiar.  Harvey Birdman is back on [adult swim].  If you haven't seen it, start watching.  Its hilarious.  And I think there was something else, but I guess I forgot it between starting this post and finishing it.  Which was the whole point of starting this post.  Damn it.  Ah, and now  Bebop  is running its series finale which dealt with this side story I always hated and which never made sense in the context of the show and which they thankfully hardly ever deal with.  Damn it.  EDIT: Oh, now I remember the something else...  I'm warming up to the Anime-inspired  Teen Titans  on Cartoon Network.  Wish I wasn't so quick to dismiss it in its first season.  Oh, and I was a little too hard on Cowboy Bebop's credits theme, but its still so much worse than all of the other great music on the show that it does stand out.

      What's up with the music in some Anime?  Is it just because I don't like Anime, because I think the title songs of some of these shows just sucks so hard its unbelievable.   Big O  is on [adult swim] right now and reminding me what crap their title song and credits songs are.  Even  Cowboy Bebop,  which has the closest music around with all this high energy fusion jazz, still has a horrific credits song that's this completely out of character ballad.  I guess its Japanesse sensibility or something, but it really throws me.  Oh, well.

      Those weird  urlLink Quiznos commercials  have been troubling me for a while.  You know, the ones with those weird singing creatures.  When they first started airing, I tried to find out more about them.  It looked very Flash animated and also reminded me of those bizarre singing kitten bumps that VH1 had been running a while back.  But, alas, I couldn't find anything.  So today, upon seeing the Quiznos ad again, I was reminded about how perplexing it was and went to post here a call for answers.  Surely, someone knew where this came from.  Surely, this was not the independant creation of an ad company.  Indeed, it wasn't.  I did a quick web search and found another blog discussing the commercial with comments that actually knew the background.  Those creatures are caled "Spongmonkeys".  Indeed, the Quiznos ad is a rewrite of a prior animation,  urlLink The Moon Song  over at  urlLink Rathergood.com.   Okay, so they were from somewhere.  But I'm still not sure why Quiznos saw fit to make a commercial from them.  Or VH1.  I guess weirdness for weirnesses sake, so more power to them.  The Travelocity Troll worked for me, maybe the Quiznos Spongmonkey will work for someone else.  Doesn't matter if it works for me because there are no Quiznos around here anyway.

      Been sick since Thursday night so haven't been able to post much.  Some damn cold.  Literally came down with it as I sat down to dinner Thurday.  I've been trying to teach myself to cook Salmon Mignon (boneless Salmon steak) with limited success.  I thought I finally had it figured out, and though I got a really nice crust to the Salmon, inside was completely rare.  I've actually developed a taste for rare Salmon because I keep screwing it up, but I still prefer it Medium.  But every recipe I find just doesn't cook it enough.  I've tried different times, marinades, sauces, basting, what have you.  It just hasn't worked.  No cooking website was of any help on teaching what might not have been going right, either.  So, I decided to try a different tactic.  Instead of looking for advice on cooking salmon steaks, how about just plain steaks.  So simple, I'm embarassed I didn't think of it sooner.  They had a ton of great suggestions and explanations for how it all works.  I knew heat was a priority, so I pumped it up when heating my grill pan.  Had it really smoking, so my eyes hurt, but it seemed to work.  Also it was suggested to finish it in the oven, so I gave that a try.  Seemed to do the trick.  Also worked a little Lime marinade to boot, since I've been on a real lime kick lately.  Got it medium rare without quite the crust I was hoping for, but still pretty damn good.  Finally got Swordfish right a couple weeks ago, so I'm feel pretty good about myself.  hehe.  Yay me!  I might just learn how to cook, yet.

      I've been getting into   urlLink Angel   this season as a result of my now ex being into the show.  I've actually been rather enjoying it, so I was disappointed to learn its being canceled after this season.  Sure, its got its off days, but its generally one of the smarter shows on TV.  It also employs the creator of the hilarious superhero spoof,  The Tick,  Ben Edlund.  I love his subversive take on the often self-important genre of the supernatural.  Suffice to say, he was firing on all cylanders for Wednesday's episode.  The show's hero, good-guy vampire Angel, marches off to fight an evil kid's show.  It doesn't go so well, so he gets turned into a puppet.  I know, silly concept.  But, they basically let the whole episode be about what its like to be a puppet.  They tweaked the character to make him more puppetish in his actions, which was a great touch.  They also went all out on the puppets.  All of them looked completely professional and convincing.  Usually a show like this would just half-ass it, but they looked like something out of Nickelodeon.  I'm a total sucker for puppets gone bad.  I loved   urlLink Greg the Bunny   on FOX a couple years back.  It just cracks me up.  Puppets are the paragon of innocence, so seeing them act in ways outside the norms of kids show is a real killer.  I love it when the Muppets do "adult" material.  Puppets for adults are a desperately underused comedic device.  So, basically, this episode of  Angel  was going to work for me.  Its just all the little commentaries on puppet behaviors.  Just so brilliant and insightful and well appreciated by me.  It reminds me of when you were a kid and you thought puppets were real.  But if they were real, they wouldn't be innocent kid's show creations, would they?  The questions asked in that just really amuse me.  Just wanted to say that.  Good night.

      I complained in January about how New Year's always heralds in the Diet programming that consumes the Food Network for the better part of the month.  I think the only show uneffected is actually Marc Summers'  Unwrapped  which is too completely about "fun" food for it really to let go on the diet nonsense.  I think, though, even it had a bit of diet junk during the month.  The rest of the line-up, including my beloved  Good Eats,  was completely overwhelmed.  Happens every year.  But, it always ends, and indeed, gives way to a host of Chocolate related programming for Valentine's Day.  Which is good.  And kind of funny.

      And no, not for the normal vast right-wing conspiracy reasons.  FOX, the most unoriginal network on television, has decided to a break from crappy realty shows and are developing a remake.  Why go through the effort of ripping off old ideas when you can just DO old ideas.  And what did they come up with?  Mr. Ed.  The talking horse.  Okay, fine.  Its FOX.  They do this kind of thing.  Its not even that high on the list of their crimes against the American public.  (The premature cancelation of Futurama, Family Guy, Greg the Bunny, Andy Ricter Controls the Universe, etc. would certainly beat it hands down)  But, that wasn't enough for Fox.  Oh, no.   urlLink They are updating the show for an urban sensibility.   A show about a talking horse.  With urban sensibility.  Voiced by George Jefferson himself, pepetual ad man Sherman Hemsley.  I checked, and its not April 1.  Which was important, because this is literally what someone would come up with if they wanted to make a joke about the horrific crimes of network executives.  But, I kinda suspect that's how FOX gets its ideas sometimes.  This is the network that gave us "When Animals Attack", after all.

      It is so refreshing to see a musical artist who can swear like an adult.  Most use profanity like 12 year olds, giggling to themselves every time they say some naughty word and trying to say as much as possible to show how bad they are.  I have nothing against swearing, but its not something you do every couple of words.  That's something kids do because they are so giddy about saying words they's not supposed to say.  That's what makes Ben Folds such a great artist.  Folds uses swears very casually.  They come up, not to show he can swear, but because that's how people talk.  That's really the brilliance of his song-writing.  The lyrics are meant to be profound, but that's what makes them profound.  They are simple, honest, casual, and meaningful.  Sometimes, the simplicity lends to intriguing reinterpretations.  Sometimes, it offers a purity of message.  Sometimes, it can even obscure the meaning.  "Brick" is that kind of song.  Its his break-through hit, probably the only one most people know of his.  The meaning is obvious, yet unstated.  By not directly confronting the issues discussed, he can get away with being direct about the emotions.  Its the kind of song that when you find out what its about, it becomes very obvious, but you probably will need to be told before you can see it.  It just works.  So, his swears are not simply to convey rage and resentment, as with some singers.  They represent many emotions.  From anger, like in "Song for the Dumped" where he sings:  So you wanted to take a break. Slow it down some, and have some space. Well, fuck you, too.  It not rage, really.  More annoyance.  Its actually become one of my favorite internal lines when I someone is demaning me without being direct about it.  Its that, "too" that takes the line from mere bitterness to an inspired mock tirade.  Other times, he tosses them off to express bemusement, frivolity, and a whole host of emotions.  Its not there to be intimidating, but to be natural.  Because normal people sometimes swear when they are frustrated or amused or saddened.  Its not in every song he writes, but he's not afraid to use them to capture the reality of the songs.  I don't know of another contemporary artist who can express so much.  Pain, love, unrequited love, lost love, resentment, emptiness, apathy, joy, and so much more.  And don't even get my started on how the piano is the most underated instrument in rock.  All too often left to easy-listening, Folds reminds us how vital a rock instrument the piano is.  He even does a cover of Elton John on his live album, which reminds us what the piano can do in Rock and Roll.  Folds is the only artist I've really gotten into in a while, and if you haven't heard his stuff, I highly recommend it.  "Whatever and Ever, Amen" with the Ben Folds Five is probably his best, and also most well known album.  Borrow it from a friend and take a listen.  Its great stuff.

      Oh, I figured I'd explain my blog title, since it is a little odd.  My last blog title was very self-conscious and obvious as a result, so this one might seem a bit odd.  Especially since my favorite color isn't red, its orange.  So what's up with Red No. 3?  Well, originally, it was the name for a pop culture commentrary site I was going to do.  Esentially, it was an uber-blog idea I had about a year and a half-ago.  Its a shame I didn't finish it, because I had a really cool design and all the graphics put together, but I just got lazy with setting up webspace.  Maybe I'll go back to eventually just because it looked so cool.  The whole graphic look was designed around the graphics style of Boston's  urlLink MBTA  Subway system.  I spent a lot of time researching their graphic design standards to get the look just right, and I was pretty proud of it.  Wound up using it in a project for work, actually, so it didn't go to waste.  Strictly speaking, I called it just Red 3 back then  I also wrote an explanation, which I publish for the first time here...  Red 3 is the food coloroing which may or may not cause cancer.  I wanted a self-aware pop-culture kind of reference.  Something which sounds cool and "inside", but obviously isn't.  I went with "Red 3" over "Yellow 5" (the coloring in Mountain Dew) purely because I liked Red better and it was easier to design with.  Generally speaking, I thought "Yellow 5" was a cooler reference, but since I was being conspiciously self-aware I figured the more pragmatic choice was appropriate.  Very postmodern.

      One of my favorite shows growing up was Nickelodeon's  Double Dare,  so it always warms my heart that  urlLink Marc Summers  is still on TV.  As a little kid, he was that rare breed of cool adult.  He's really just a good host.  Its obviously what he was born to do.  He's just got the touch.  A lot of kids show hosts, especially kids game shows like Double Dare, act like they are big kids.  Not Marc.  He let himself be an adult, but a fun adult.  He wasn't acting goofy and dressing like a 12 year old like some people (I'm looking at you  urlLink J. D. Roth )  Heck, he almost always was wearing a tie and jacket.  But he looked like he was genuinely having fun.  He didn't make the show seem canned and stale, but gave it a spontianity because he genuinely seem amused with what was going on.  For those who weren't watching Nickelodeon in the late 80's, what went on was all manner of slime, goo, and food play.  The culmination of the show as the "Messiest Minute on TV", which involved the kid contestants running through a slime filled opsticle course.  Which makes it all more amazing that Marc suffers from OCD.  Literally, this had to be the worst job for someone with OCD, but he did great.  And I've always got a special place in my TV heart for Marc Summers.  Sure, he's a little cheesy and over enthusiastic hosting the Food Network's Unwrapped series, but he makes it work.  He's just got the natural charm to win us over.  Not to mention its a cool idea for a show.  The quick hits giving the behind the scenes scoop on favorite foods is just right.  The stories are never too long for the premise to wear thin, but just enough to leave you satisfied.  And with Marc Summers along for the ride, what's not to like?

I'll migrate the posts to a new pop culture blog, and maybe a politics blog eventually.  If you're interested, post a comment below with your email and I'll send you the URL.  Good bye.   Note:  You are at the new URL now.  All posts prior to this were made at my first blog, "obligatory title".  All those after this post were made right here.

      I'm officially giving up on fat acceptance.  I'm sick of being put off by a movement which doesn't care one bit about advancing its message or standing up to the bigots who want to abuse us.  I'm washing my hands.  I can't keep putting my hope in a movement which has no desire to work for anything.  The last straw is getting chastized for having the audacity to mind people trying to organize campaigns of personal abuse against me because of my belief in fat acceptance.  Apparently, there is something wrong with me for not valuing the continually destructive input of someone who visited a fat hate site with the sole purpose of drumming up some personal attacks against me and who CONTINUES to post abusive shit here.  I guess if that's the kind of voice who is valued within Fat Acceptance, its time I realized that my voice isn't valued and isn't wanted.  Seeing that from NAAFA wasn't at all surprising, but its clear that its a problem with the movement entirely.  I'm sick of being made to feel like I have a problem because I don't want to play nice with people who attack me and my friends all the time.  Because I don't want to sit by and watch some undercover bigot continually try to subvert discussions.  But, hey.  I thought going to fat hate sites to propose personal harrassment of people advocating fat acceptance was enough to have a problem with someone.  Obviously, there is something wrong with  me.   Well, I don't think I should just forget when someone personally attacks me and tries to encourage others to join in.  I don't get how that behavior is okay, but remembering it is wrong.  So I guess its me.  Because I am really fed up with getting personally attacked for standing up for Fat Acceptance and then being lectured by so-called Fat Acceptance advocates at why I'm the one who is wrong because I'm not willing to play pretend and treat these creeps with the respect they've never had any intention of showing any of us.  I don't get how fat acceptance opperates, so I'm just going to walk away.  I look around at all of these great blogs on progressive issues, and they are inspiring.  They are consistantly unapologetic and encourage standing up for what you believe.  There is this growing community of people who aren't going to take attacks lying down.  The know the difference between right and wrong.  They don't waste their time going to a website run by someone who violently hates what they stand for and who has actively organized massive attacks on websites that advocate beliefs he cannot tolerate.  Especially not going to those sites to suck up to the bigots.  These aren't shades of gray!  A person who mobilizes and organizes troll attacks for the better part of a year against a major size acceptance doesn't get to be treated with respect.  This is about clarity at the most basic level.  If we can't even be clear that this is wrong, how can we stand for anything?  If we pretend these abusive actions didn't happen, how can we stand up for ourselves when they ramp up the abusive even more?  Yet people keep doing it.  They go to the site of a hate monger to suck up him and his supporters.  They refuse to stand up to him when he continues to post at the site he targeted for his troll attacks.  They continue to treat the people who side with this bigot like they are valuable members of the Fat Acceptance community.  This jack-ass made things as black and white as possible, but still people won't stand up to him.  So why should I expect people to stand up when some loud-mouth starts expressing violent hatred.  Why should I expect people to think visiting a hate site to propose personal harrassment is a bad thing?  I shouldn't.  But I did.  I expected Fat Acceptance communities where people could feel safe to discuss fat acceptance.  Not one where they could feel that they'd get targeted for reprisals at hate sites, and the organizers of the community would cheer that on.  If I don't expect better, what's the point?  Well, I don't expect better anymore.  I expect fat accpetance to keep sucking up to bigots and keep telling people who don't like sucking up to bigots that they have a problem.  So I don't see a point in it, anymore.  I don't get it.  I guess its just me.  Fat Acceptance wants to be about protecting the rights of hate-mongers who already dominate discussion of these issues.  Its dead, or at least it will be.  I'd rather mourn today than keep getting disillusioned for years to come as time and time again, fat hatred gets the protection it so obviously doesn't need from the people who claim to pushing for fat rights.  And fat people continue to be targets.  The bigots have won.  Because too many "good" people were willing to lay down and let them.  To hell with them all.  I'm just going to stop hoping for change.  Its not going to happen.  Its going to keep getting worse and so-called fat activists will keep conceeding more and more to bigots.  I'm not happy about it, but maybe just not caring anymore will be something.  So congrats to the two trolls who keep posting here.  You win.  Way to go.  Hope you are really happy with yourselves, fighting for bigotry and persecution.  You're really big people, aren't you.  Fuck them all.  I'm just so sick of it.

      A Republican State Senator from Kansas has come out against the 19th Ammendment.  You know, the one that granted women the right to vote.  When invited to an event in celebration of the 19th Ammendment, they declined saying that they wouldn't like what the person would have to say.  Meaning that they felt Women's Suffrage was "not necessarily" a good thing.  In later interviews, they elaborated saying that "Men should take care of women" and that if they were taking care of women, then women wouldn't have the right to vote.  You may have noticed me playing the pronoun game.  Because, naturally, the person coming out against a woman's right to vote  urlLink is a woman.   Like I said.  Huh?

      I've been very busy at work and generally disinterested in posting.  Sorry.  Trying to get back in the habit, though, so here I am.  Gay Marriage is back in the news in a big way.  Massachusetts has been debating it for the last couple of days with no real resolution in any direction.  The State Legislature is debating a Constitutional Ammendment in response to the Supreme Court (of MA) declaring Gay Marriage a constitutional requirement in the Commonwealth.  So far, they've rejected three attempts at wording it correctly.  I kinda think they are just at an impasse, but the big wigs are confidant that they'll figure something out.  Basically, it sets up where the group unwilling to back off gay marriage and the group unwilling to allow even civil unions makes up a majority, so the people trying to find a compramise (often a Constitutional establishment of Civil Union with full Marriage rights and responsibilities) can't get it to work.  Everytime they get a few from one camp to cross over, they lose a few more they had.  All very promising, I think.  The process is so long in Mass anyway, that the earliest this will be voted on by the public is November of 2006.  It also needs to get approved again by the legislature in one of the next two years, which would not be sure at all given how tight this is.  The longer it takes the better it looks for the pro-gay marriage side.  I really think the day the first gay marriage takes place and the world doesn't end will be a big victory.  As it stands, the polls say that an anti-gay marriage ammendment would probably fail in Mass and things are going only in that direction.  Speaking of the world not ending when a gay couple gets married, San Francisco appears to be feeling very left out by all the attention on Massachusetts.  San Fran's new mayor decided to engage in some civil disobediance and has ordered the city to start issuing marriage liscences to gay couples, and officials married a lesbian couple today.  The women are 79 and 83 and have been together for over 50 years.  And that's supposed to be a bad thing?  Let George W. make an issue out of this.  I dare him to try explaining why a pair of 80 year olds who've been together for half a century are some threat to Western Civilization.  I dare him.  Speaking of W., the press have finally noticed that they are allowed to press him and they are going after the AWOL story with a vegence.  Mostly fueled by Bush himself, whose attempts to diffuse the story have been so increasingly comical that they've managed to keep it alive.  Not really at the expense of the whole lying about the War stuff, too, since he keeps managing to screw that up, too.  First he goes on Meet the Press and makes a fool out of himself by dodging questions so obviously and artlessly that fellow conservatives were pissed at him.  He also tried to pretend that people were attacking him to "deningrate the Guard", which really seems to have only reminded people that the Vietnam era National Guard was a form of draft dodging, while today they are being used as cannon fodder.  And then he promissed he'd release all of his military records.  Then he didn't.  But he release pay stubs, but those were inconsistant with his previous stories and didn't really prove anything, anyway.  And best case scenario, all they showed was Bush set out to do the bare minimum in order to get an Honorable Discharge.  And by this time, people were starting to figure out something was fishy with his medical status.  Bush refused to take a yearly physical which resulted in his flight status being revoked.  His explanation that he needed to see his family physician and they were in Texas while he was in Alabama just wasn't working anymore.  It all seems stunningly unsoldierly when you think about it for more than a second.  But Bush responded to those by releasing records showing he was ontop of his medical status.  Dental records.  Cuz, that really addresses the issues.  Not only was that bizarely non-responsive, they were also intended to prove he served in Alabama.  Only trouble is that the Dental records were for after he left Alabama, which makes no sense whatsoever.  But some GOPers have responded to all this with "Bring it On".  Seems they enjoy the idea of comparing Vietnam era service records with John Kerry.  You know, the war hero who saved more than a few lives of those he served with AND who had moral courage to return to the US and protest the war.  That's who they want to go up against, with a guy who used political connections to get into the National Guard, where he's often bragged about how much fun he had protecting the country from, um, Canadian air assaults, but he didn't even really serve in the guard after taking a spot that meant someone else got shipped off to Vietnam, and he let himself get disqualified from flying anyone so he couldn't protect us from those aerial threats from Mexico anyway, and then got himself out of it early so he could go to business school, all so he wouldn't have to actually fight in a war he supported from a man who would later boast about him being a "War President".  Yep, that's a fight they want.  And why, you ask?  Are Rethugs living in some bizarro world?  Nope, see, they got this picture, see, and it shows Jane Fonda at an anti-war rally and like three rows back, there is Kerry.  He's out of focus, since its a picture of Jane Fonda and Kerry wasn't close to her to begin with.  But that's their big scary weapon.  Uh huh.  Failing that, they are prepared to accuse him of having sex with an intern.  The sad thing is, I'm not even joking.

      Sorry, I haven't posted since I announced my break-up.  No, I'm not moping around heartbroken.  Just didn't feel like writing anything else.  Still debating the whole satelite blog thing.  Besides, I've been posting a lot at political blogs so that's been taking up a lot of time.  So, I'm just going to toss off a bunch of random shit today.  First off,  urlLink Amazon.com  freaking rules.  I ordered a book  urlLink (Box Office Poison)  and a DVD  urlLink (Friends: Season 6).   Now, I'm raving about Amazon all over work.  I ordered this on Monday, and got it today.  That's just fantastic!  Free shipping and everything.  When I get free shipping from Barnes and Noble, I get what I pay for.  Amazon goes the extra distance, though.  BUT, I did have a problem.  Because what should I discover when I open up the book?  Stuck between two pages is a dead fly.  A fucking dead fly smeared over the book.  I tried to be understanding about it, but the more I thought about it, the less I understood it.  I mean, ewwwwwwww!  How does that even happen?  I'm more understanding about finding a fly in a salad.  At least that makes sense.  Anyway...  So Janet showed her boobie.  Yeah, that really destroyed civilization.  It really worries me when I see the reaction some people had.  My reaction?  "Was that Janet Jackson's breast?"  And that was it.  But that gets a government investigation in a matter of hours.  The Vice President's staff exposing a CIA operative's identity and the Justice Department drags its feet.  Iraq intelligence takes a few days, and only so long as the investigation is set up in such a way that it can only punish the CIA.  But this has all been said by better people than I.  Did you know there is a professional, major league Hockey team in Columbus?  Well, of course YOU don't know, but I didn't either.  Not that I'm a hockey fan, but I figured I watched enough Sportscenter to have an understanding of it on a basic level.  I knew all the other teams, even some other new ones.  But Columbus?  Columbus, Ohio?  A major league sports franchise?  Columbus?  See, this is why I don't like hockey.  Have I mentioned that I collect  urlLink Muppets action figures?   Oh.  My.  God.  They just keep kicking so much ass it's not funny.  (Oh, and I do know I'm swearing a lot.  Just mixing it up, keeping it real, and all that jazz.  *cough*)  ANYWAY, they just released some previews of upcoming figures to their newsletter.  They are so cool.  I can't show you pictures, I'm afraid, since its an exclusive fan club newsletter deal for people who pay them money to get special figures, which I finally decided to do since they are supposed to come out with a special Jim Henson as a muppet figure sometime this year.  Which kicks ass, but isn't what I'm really excited about.  The figures so far have been awesome in detail and playability.  They look great, dead-on accurate, but they are fun, too.  I just love that I have a figure of the Muppet newsman, and Gonzo with Camilla, and Statler and Waldorf, even.  The coolest thing have been their playsets, though.  The Swedish Chef Kitchen set is just sick.  Its got like 40 kitchen accessories that are all perfect and great on their own, but the kitchen itself is insane.  Its just so much fun.  I love collecting these toys because its just a great flashback to when I was a kid and so easily amused by a new toy.  Anyway, a future playset is the real holy grail.  They are doing the Muppet backstage.  The thing is 2.5 floors and it looks perfect.  Just like it was on the show.  I already can't wait.  Anyway, check out their site and some of what they've released.  I can't recommend them enough.  They are just a great company that really cares about their fans, too, which is always cool.  Like you cared about that.  hehe.

      I realized something about the "Things I'm embarassed about" post.  2 of the 3 are things that are overtly masculine.  3 if you add the unsaid "Is a big baseball fan" since most of my blog readers already know that and were already surprised to hear it.  Its definetly an odd quirk about me because I genuinely am that kind of sensitive, poetic, creative guy who is very much in touch with his feminine side.  And yet, I am in no way metrosexual-esque.  Indeed, there are plenty of very manly things about me.  That's why I understand the difference between feminene and effeminate.  Effeminate really has nothing to do with how women actually act.  Having feminene traits and interests really only compliment my masculine traits to make me a more rounded individual.  And yet, its the manly stuff I tend to be ashamed about.  Go figure.  For instance, I recently cut my hair quite short (for me, anyway) and then dyed it a very vauge shade of red.  And I was asking around if people could see the dye.  Here I am this big guy who is going on about his hair, but at the same time I'm not all metrosexual about it and I don't have some big hair care regimine.  I like it to look good, but I don't like to fuss with it.  The perfect marriage of male and female.  I was also asking for opinions about an outfit I'm considering.  Pairing a dark orange with an olive suit.  Very autumnal, was the opinion, but it'd probably work.  All weird, but I'm happy with the result.  (Now if I can just learn to spell feminine before I go into a big long post about it)

      For lack of any better idea, I thought I'd shoot off a post on vaugely embarassing things about myself and my interests that I have generally avoided discussing here.  Because, why not.  I figure I might as well get them out of the way now instead of occassionally making a point not to mention them.   #1. I like the Grand Theft Auto video games  What I can say?  Killing prostitutes is fun.  Seriously, though, GTA3 and Vice City and genuinely inspired games and a very real extension of what is possible in the genre.  The expansiveness and open-ended game-play model is beyond impressive.  Sure, its crime and wanton destruction, but that's about the only objective that would work for fully independant game-play.  Sure, each game has a psuedo story to occupy your time, but even there they went all out to insure enjoyment.  The introductions are shown like a movie and star genuine movie stars.  Something which has apparently really caught on.  The latest James Bond video game not only allows you to a controla  Bond that looks like Pierce Brosnan, he IS Pierce Brosnan.  What's more, Willam Dafoe is cast as the villian just for the video game.  He's an "A" list star and its not like he's just voicing some character that doesn't look like him.  It really is Willam Dafoe as your nemesis.  Its even got all new "Bond Girls" and John Clease reprising his role as Q.  To top it all off, Oscar winner Judi Dench reprises her Bond role, too.  The whole thing is presented like a movie that you get to play.  And Grand Theft Auto was at the forefront of that.  The voice talent for Vice City was amazing.  At the end of the day, are the GTA games that much worse than other forms of Crime entertainment, like the obvious influences of  Scarface  and  The Godfather Trilogy.   And speaking of enjoying violence...   #2.  I watch Professional Wrestling.  Bet you wouldn't have guessed this.  Its probably the one thing I enjoy that I'm the most sheepish about because I *know* how silly it is, but I like it anyway.  I grew up in Connecticut in the 80's when it was required for boys to be WWF fans.  WWF was headquartered just down the road, after all, and even major stars would occassionally appear at signings in my hometown since it was so close to the HQ.  It didn't hurt that it was still an underground thing back then, even as it built itself up off Hulk Hogan.  But, I grew out of it.  Then in college, I caught a bit of it while flipping through the channels and noticed a guy my brother had really liked as a kid was back on TV.  I pointed him out and my brother got a kick out of it.  Eventually, though, he really got back into it.  Actually, even my mom got into it.  So, I was chagrined by this, but I would also watch it while home.  What can I say, it amused me.  When I got back to school, I took a class on television criticism and the Professor practically begged someone to write about Wrestling.  I took the bait and spent a semester very closely watching and researching Pro-Wrestling.  At the end I had myself my only collegite A+ and a new hobby.  Now, I'm not a crazy huge fan.  I don't buy the PPVs, though I do have video games and action figures.  Actually, that's what got me into collecting toys.   But still, its not so much the violence I like, but the theatricallity of it.  Its really a moral theater of our age.  A choreographed dance of good vs. evil.  But, I still know its silly and though I'm generally unapologetic, I still get sheepish about it.   #3.  I am fascinated by Pokemon  There is just something about Pokemon that I find completely fascinating.  The cartoon, not the card game or video games.  I find it utterly amazing that they produce so many shows with so few plots.  I watched a lot of it in college just because when it was on and when I was in my dorm room.  Essentially, there were 5 different plots that ALL of the shows fell into.  1. Ash befriends another Pokemon trainer with a new and different Pokemon. 2. Ash captures a new Pokemon. 3. Ash wins a gym badge or other prize. 4. Ash competes in a tournament. 5. Ash says good bye to a Pokemon.  EVERY episode falls into one of those plots and they all proceed almost the exact same way.  Only the details are changed.  I'm not saying I like the show, just that I am amazed at how much they produce with so few ideas.  Okay, so none of those were THAT embarassing, but that was kinda what I was going for.  You don't think I'd tell you anything actually embarassing, now do you?

      Working on a couple posts, either of which I might post later tonight, but I thought I'd just toss off some unrelated blathering now.  First off, if anyone knows of anyone looking for an apartment in Boston, please feel free to show them my way.  Yeah, I know chances are none to none, but I'm getting desperate.  Need to have someone by April 17 or I'm stuck paying for a 2 bedroom on my own in May.  It was stupid of me to take the chance, but whats done is done.  Guess I just won't get down to NYC to see the Whitney Biennial like I wanted to.  And good lord do I hate Jenny Craig.  Just saw some mind-numbingly stupid commercial about some woman who was so horrified to see herself at 175 that she destroyed pictures of herself from a family vacation.  And her response to her effort to erase herself from her family's memories?  To make herself more appropriate for her family memories.  Because God forbid she examine why she is allowing her body issues to control her life like that.  No reason to work on THAT when you can just make yourself look more appropriate for a limited period of time.  BUT ANYWAY....  Blue robot was gone today.  One can only hope he will find the help he needs to pick up the pieces of his life and move on.

      I was walking down my street tonight when I saw perhaps the weirdest thing I've ever seen lying in the street.  Right there in the gutter at the corner was a blue  urlLink Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robot.   This troubles me.  It was anywhere near a pile of trash or anything.  Garbage Day isn't until Friday, anyway.  Besides, it was at the corner, so no one would leave their trash their anyway.  Its not like it was with the whole ring or the red robot.  Just the blue guy all on his own.  Did he refuse to throw a fight with the Red Robot and the Robot Mafia had him beaten and left for dead?  Perhaps he hobbled there from Robot Fight Club.  Maybe a life of violence was deeply troubling to Blue Robot, and led him to abuse drugs and now here he lies, collapsed from a drug induced stupor.  Its all very troubling.  Now, if I see Optimus Prime in the gutter tomorrow, I'll worry.

       urlLink [adult swim]  has been cracking me up with their latest promotion, "Flying Shark vs. Flying Crocodile Week".  At first, I just thought it was a joke about the those annoying Shark/Crocodile weeks on the Discovery Channel.  I figured [as] was just taking that silly little ratings gimmick and wildly exaggerating it for comedic effect.  Very funny, I thought.  But then, I find out that the Discovery Channel actually IS doing a "Shark vs. Croc" week and all [as] did was add the flying.  And yet, that made it so much funnier because just knowing that there is actually a Shark vs. Croc week complete with robotic Sharks and Crocodiles doing battle is so funny on its own.  The fact that [adult swim] was so ahead of the game on mocking something that so desperately screams out to be mocked is just genius.  Did they wait for Shark vs. Croc week to happen to make fun of it?  Oh, no.  They identified its absurdity straight away and put all their efforts into mocking it.  Complete with a Shark supporting a jet pack and a Crocodile with wings.  I just can't get over that there actually IS a "Shark vs. Crocodile" week.  I generous applaud [as] for understanding just how damn funny that is.

         My employer's CD, which referenced the other day, is  urlLink now available.   I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys a capella choral music.  Again, it really blew me away and there are some sound clips for you all to listen to, as well.  I'm not begging you to buy it, but if its your sort of thing, I'm sure you will not be disappoint.  It is an incredibly beautiful and moving album.  Pre-order your copy TODAY!  Sorry, the Marketing Professional in my took over there.  My sincerest apologies.

      I'm really angry with myself.  Inspite of being Irish, I forgot to wear green today.  (I've since rectified that situation and am wearing far too much green)  Not only that, but I wore orange.  If you didn't know, wearing orange on St. Patrick's Day is very, very, very bad.  It's a show of disrespect to Irish Catholics.  I know, orange is on the Irish flag, but that's because the flag was designed as a symbol of unity between the Catholics (green) and the Protestants (orange) with a field of white to represent peace between them.  But that doesn't mean orange is cool with the Catholics.  Orange is the color of the English protestant invaders.  The people who stole land from my Irish annecestors and who to this day celebrate their invasion by marching through the streets of Catholic neighborhoods on its anniversary.  Very bad form all around.  I was most entirely embarassed by my faux pas.  In other housekeeping issues, I will indeed be providing a link to purchase my employer's CD when it's available.  I'll be happy to take credit when we get a bunch of California orders.  Also, the TV show I raved about the other day, "Wonderfalls", will be reaired on Thursday night on FOX at 9pm.  In spite of its impending fat baiting, it really is a great, smart show and there aren't enough of those on TV.  Now, if only we can get a great, smart show that won't devolve into fat jokes at some point, we'll be all set.  But, I fear in this cultural climate, that is not a luxury we can afford.  Grrr.

      I'm working on an annoucement of a CD my employer is releasing later this month.  I've gotten a hold of a review copy of the CD and have been listening to it all day.  Its stuff like that which really makes working for a non-profit arts organizatin worth it.  Knowing I've got a hand in putting out such a fantastic product.  I've had concert fatigue for a while and have been avoiding them for more than a year, even shows I know I'd love.  But listening to the CD reminds me of what I love about this work.  Its really my kinda recording, too.  All a capella choral music, mostly contemporary stuff.  The kind of thing I loved performing back when I was a singer.  Indeed, its got one of my favorite all-time choral works, the Randall Thompson Alleluia.  Its all this beautiful, solumn, reflective music.  Really great stuff, and listening to it makes me know why some in the office are really optimistic about the recording.  Its really got the goods for a breakthrough success.  We'll be doing pre-sales on our website trying to get our sales up so we can debut in the Billboard Classical Top Ten when we officiall release.  Even slightly hopeful for a Grammy nomination.  We shared a Grammy last year, so we have some reason to be hopeful.  The concept of the album is peaceful music for reflection and what-not.  But its not as intelligence insulting as those albums usually are.  Its really beautiful music.  And something I really feel proud to have a part in, however small.  Yay me!  Oh, and hi Misty.

      Sometimes, a TV show comes along that is so refreshingly different, unique, original, and just plain good that it reaffirms your faith in television.  Then you get to be pissed off that its on FOX.  I suppose its too easy to be hard on FOX for their track record of canceling refreshingly original TV shows.  Sure, they've racked up a lot of victims, (Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Futurama, The Tick, Firefly are just recent victims) but they only stand out because the other networks don't air refreshigly original programs.  So shouldn't FOX get some credit for at least trying?  Afraid not.  Because FOX knows these shows don't have a chance, so they are culpable for teasing the viewing public with good programing only to pull it away just as our attention is peaked.  They are, indeed, worse for giving us good TV and pulling it away than the other networks are for never giving it to us at all.  The bastards.  Besides, slim as the chances are, they might be hording the good shows so they can kill them least another network land them.  The bastards.  Their latest inevitable victim debuted today.  It was put off from the Fall, then from mid-season, and now it lands at mid-mid-season.  I guess it would be too dangerous to debut it in the summer when it could become a sleeper hit.  Meet "Wonderfalls", the story of a mid-20's slacker from Niagra Falls named Jaye.  Ivy-League educated, she's now being passed over for the Assistant Manager position at a tourist trap gift shop and doing all she can to disappoint her family.  As she puts it, they all work very hard and are dissatisfied with their lives.  She's dissatisfied without even working hard.  Until one day, inanimate objects start talking to her.  Not long conversations, mind you.  Their remarks are more of the cryptic variety, but somehow they manage to lead her to help people.  Which is entirely not what Jaye wants to do, as she becomes increasingly annoyed but simultaniously complacant with the whole going insane thing.  Its all played very quirky and funny and its just great.  It feels like a lot of the quirky surreality type shows that have come before it, but also immediately finds its own voice.  For one, things don't get "too weird".  Its not a freak-show like, say, Twin Peaks or Eerie, Indiana of the Adventures of Pete and Pete.  Its only Jaye that's getting the weird.  And she's also out to help people, but has a very real response to it all.  Its warm without being sappy.  Jaye remains cynical in the face of the mystic, but also remains entirely likable and enjoyable.  An added benefit is that the lead is my age.  I'm a weird age that's been largely ignored on TV.  There were never TV kids my age.  No rowdy college kids my age.  No mid-20's types finding their way in the world my age.  Well, a few, but not many.  Now, to be fair, the character is 2 years my junior, but that's pretty close and the actress is my age, so I'll count it.  I can absolutely identify with the mid-20's malaise, so all the stuff going on when toy lions are chatting with Jaye are very cool for me.  (Minor caveat: some reviews seem to indicate some gratuitous fat bashing in a future episode.  Ugh.  Is any show able to respect fat people?  Maybe we'll get lucky and it'll resolve well, but I'm not getting my hopes up.  And another show forces me to grin and bear it just to watch good TV.  Grrr.)   UPDATE:  On my fat bashing concerns, it appears they aren't gratuitious, but rather a plot point.  Double Ugh.  In a future episode (though not next week's if you want to watch then) Jay is obsessed with a fat neighbor who she refers to with a mean-spirited nick-name.  She gets come-uppence for this, but on the way the guy is continually contratulated for his weight loss.  The only positive is that the story is clear-ish that his weight loss doesn't solve his problems.  Except they kinda do.  Like I said, Grrr.  At least its an entire episode I can skip.  If I'm lucky, it'll happen on the upcoming Friday night I'm working.

      Actually, I'm not really.  I just buy like a geek.  Just looking back at all my frivalous purchases in the last month and it is such a geek fest.  A whopping 20  urlLink MST3K  DVDs, the latest volume of the  urlLink Futurama  season sets on DVD, the second set of  urlLink Star Trek  action figures, and the exclusive  urlLink "Adventure" Kermit  action figure (aka. Indiana Jones rip-off Kermit).  Oh, and some other stuff I'm not mentioning because they are more geeky embarassing than geeky cool so I make a point to mention it here.  Geez, just writing that has me anxious about money again.  And feeling like a super geek.  I'm really not that geeky.  I mean, I don't go to Star Trek conventions.  I don't collect comic books.  I don't play RPGs.  Well, okay, I have a couple, but not nearly enough to call me a collector.  I don't dress like a geek.  Its just the toys and DVDs.  Really, I swear.  Well, and I watch Angel.  But I watch Friends, too!  That more than balances it out, right?  Oh, and I blog, too.  God, I'm such a geek.  And poor.  That, too.  Damn non-profit not paying me better.  Oh, yeah.  Non-profit.  Opps.

      I've been feeling very anxious about money lately.  I think I'm overreacting, though, because I've been pretty good for a while now.  When I first left my ex-ex-girlfriend, I rang up a lot of credit card debts in the process of getting myself together on my own.  I eventually got a loan to pay them off, and haven't carried any credit card debt past the first statement since.  But, my savings are very tight now, because of some slightly excessive Christmas spending.  Now, it was temporary, and I've cashed in all the money coming to me to get back together, and it won't be that bad.  Lucky I'm single and spending less as a result, hehe.  So, though I'm panicy, its not that bad.  So, I'm trying not to drive myself crazy when stuff comes along that I want.  Like the toys I collect, for instance.  This month is hitting me badly on that front, actually.  hehe.  The other thing are DVD's.  Ordinarily, this is no biggie.  Except that this week a local music/dvd store is having a big sale with 25% off all DVD's.  Nothing that gets my juices going like a good sale.  The prospect of passing up the opportunity to get some stuff I want at the lowest price I'll ever see them is too enticing.  Sure, some stuff will go down anyway, but I think I can identify those titles.  But some stuff I want clearly isn't going down in price.  Why not take the savings?  Now, this would be simple enough if it was a couple DVD's.  I've already gotten one I've wanted for a long time, and am looking at a couple others.  What's going to kill me, though, is stressing over the Mystery Science Theater 3000 DVD sets.  I've long been a big MST3K fan, and with it off the air for good, I want something for my bot fix.  These DVD sets are a great value with 4 movies in one set.  Its a great way to start a collection and I'm salivating over getting them.  Except, as of Tuesday, there will be 5 sets and a total of 20 movies.  That ain't cheap.  But, it does mean I save a ton on something I completely intend to purchase.  Like $60.  That's a good use of money right?  Sure, I'm putting down $200 dollars, but saving $60.  That's sensible, right?  Man, I hope they haven't sold the DVD's yet.  I better go first thing Monday morning.

      I hate to push down my lengthy discussion of fat sexuality, but it was pretty disorganized anyway so I'm not too broken up.  Just I know people don't always check my blog on a regular basis, especially since I've been blogging so in frequently.  But anyway...  A while back I posted about my love of Cartoon Network, specifically [adult swim].  The other thing I watch faithfully on CN are their superhero programs.  Initially, this was just their Jusice League show, but they took it off the air just before the season finale was to air, and are holding off on it until closer to when the next season is ready.  Grrr.  So, to fill my superhero fix until Justice League returns in the summer (and the new Batman animated series starts up in the fall) I've been watching  Teen Titans,  a show I initially hated by am quickly coming around on.  The problem with Titans is that its style can be off-putting to folks like me who've been drawn into superhero cartoons by the 90's Batman and Superman cartoons, and their successor Justice League.  Instead of the dark, realist style of the Batman cartoons, we're treated to a show which very intentionally echos kiddie-anime style.  The character and scenary designs are simple and exaggerated.  It focuses a lot of kid-stuff interaction between the teen superheros.  Its all brightly colored with distinct swaths of color.  Most of all it incorporates what is called "Super-D" animation.  The "D" being short for deformation.  Basically, it describes a style of animation where the laws of physics are routinely ignored for very little reason.  We're not talking about Bugs Bunny breaking the law of physics, either.  More like people's heads growing huge  urlLink when they are angry,  becoming childlike when they are  urlLink crushing on someone,  or  urlLink other   urlLink such   urlLink deformaties.   Esentially, the character emotions are expressed on screen physically.  Its something I hate about most kiddie anime.  It just pulls me out of the story instead of illustrating.  Still, something works about it.  It takes the Japanese techniques and reinvents them for an American audience.  It really revels in the Super-D stuff.  Usually, its just used as a gag in anime, but Teen Titans very expressly uses it to convey emotion and character sentiment.  Instead of a gimmick, it feels stylized.  It plays off the character relationships.  Indeed, the show really is into character relationships.  While aimed squarely at kids, there is a lot of mature stuff going on just beneath the surface.  It also made good use of the lesser known characters they chose for the show.  Instead of the original Teen Tians, which were a bunch of kid-versions of major superheros, they went with what I'm told is an 80's incarnation of the team.  Although mainstay Robin is the anchor of the group, the remaining Titans are unfamiliar to average fans like me who don't read comic books.  This allowed them to really establish the relationships without worrying about expectations or having the adult versions overshadow the Titans.  A couple kiddie-versions have snuck into episodes, but they exist on their own.  They are not their fathers children (or their hero's sidekick).  They even took one of the goofiest heros in DC's books, Speedy, (the junior marksman sidekick to the Robin Hood-esque Green Arrow) and made something of him.  The core Titans have easily identified motivations for interacting with each other.  They are patient enough and confident enough to keep up with this.  These are very fully formed characters.  Moreover, the stories are more than the usual villian of the week fare these shows usually have.  Oh sure, it has the obligatory rogues gallery, but the team has a genuine arch-enemy.  He may not factor into every story, but he's there.  They're really respecting the comic book background, too, which I respect, while not being beholden to it, which I appreciate.  Thus, they are adding a layer of understanding without adding a layer of difficulty.  All told, I'm pretty impressed by a show I had quickly written off.  Its fun, action-packed, and quite enjoyable.  And despite the Super-D stuff and kid friendly coloring, it still can look  urlLink very,   urlLink very,   urlLink very   urlLink cool.   Its not everyone's cup of tea, but I like it.

      So, I can't get that orchestral riff from that new Britney Spears song out of my head.  (Oh, and don't worry, this is eventually not a post about Britney)  That one that gets repeated throughout the song.  Its very catchy, since its not like I watch MTV so I had to pick this up from music being played in restaurants or stores, news stories about her, or the occassional few seconds flipping past MTV.  Still, its telling that this is ALL I know about the song.  While I'm not a fan, I can easily sing the chorus and a few verses of  "Baby, One More Time" and the chours of "Opps..."  Her more recent stuff, though, has catchy hooks but little else.  I know the line "I'm a Slave 4 U" but thats all from that song.  Not even words from this new song.  Guess she's turning out to be another Debbie Gibson instead of another Madonna.  Though she certainly has a way with self-promotion.  Anyway, in the course of the media saturation that enabled me to know that orchestral riff I have caught bits and pieces of her video for the song.  She's obviously getting a lot more sexual and there are these scenes of her writhing about wearing some shear, sequined number that had the effect of her looking nude and shimmering.  Eh.  I'm clearly not the target audience for this, but it reminds me that there aren't images like that which I'm the target audience for.  I'd been thinking about this anyone because I've bizarrely started getting Victoria's Secret catalogs.  I know a lot of men intentionally get these, but I'm pretty much the wrong guy for that.  That's one of the weird things about growing up a fat admirer.  I couldn't turn on MTV and see some cute SSBBW in some slinky number bopping to the music.  I couldn't conive my way into possessing a lingere catalog with some size 26's models.  It would be realistically impossible for me to satisfy a curiousity for porn.  As a result, I think I've grown up with a very different attitude towards sex and sexual attraction than most guys.  But, while I think I've gotten the better out of all of this, I know a lot of FA's who seem to have ended up pretty screwed up by this.  For me, this all meant that I grew up without having my sexuality defined for me.  As I discovered being an FA, I was able to find what I liked about that.  I wasn't just being told to be obsessed about breasts.  Indeed, what I am is fairly ambivalent about them.  Not like I dislike them, they just aren't something that really motivates me in terms of physical attraction.  I was able to discover what I liked all on my own.  Its not even just about specific physical aspects I like, but even the activities of sex.  I was never told what to like, how to like it, what to expect.  These are things men learn from mainstream pornography, but I never watched that.  Even now, I'm not sure I've ever seen a proper porn film.  Enlightened though I may be, I won't pretend I don't like to view sexually suggestive images, but what I like hasn't been dictated to me.  I'm also really impressed with what has popped up with internet fat "porn" sites in the last few years.  What I see is two different approaches.  People making ordinary porn with fat models, and people making some unique for the fat community.  The latter is my clear preference.  A lot of it isn't even porn in any reasonable manner, since many models never post nude.  So why is that popular?  Well, I think its because its filling a gap.  People who like thin women take for granted that they will see countless images of attractive thin women all day.  Just open a newspaper, turn on the TV, look at the K-Mart flyer.  Its a given.  It isn't porn, either, but it plays a part in sexuality nonetheless.  FA's don't get that. We get little bits here and there.  We get to watch trashy talk shows in the hopes that their might be a fat guest today.  We get the occassional guest spot by designated fat actress of the moment.  (currently Lindsay Hollister, recently seen on L&O:SVU)  We get the even more occassional fat regular character, often cast with an incredible shrinking actress.  And forget about seeing any "skin".  The best you'll get is some woman on Jerry Springer whose shirt rides up when she inevitably starts pounding on some other fat woman who stole her man.  I have to think this really screws a lot of guys up.  Its all those things "normal" people take for granted that really makes the impact. The ordinary images of what you find sexually attractive.  I think some guys respond by obsessing over what images the see.  They fixate on them in an unhealthy way.  Others, turn to mainstream porn to fill the gap.  I worry about those guys the most.  Aside from how restricting it is for guys who are into thin women, the way mainstream porn treats fat women is beyond disgusting.  It makes their ordinary debasement of women look downright civilized.  Fat women are treated like a freak show, dehumanized to an unprecidented extreme.  And that's what is teaching some of these men how to be an FA.  So, I really think these "ordinary" images of fat women can have a positive influence.  I know some women who have sites like that, and I know they do it for themselves more than for anyone who may be watching.  Its a way of celebrating their bodies, their sexualty, on their terms.  Its not about mimicing mainstream porn or mainstream images.  Its finding something of our own.  What's important is that it remains expansive and doesn't just develop its own restrictions on what is allowed to be sexually attractive.  I'm hopeful that it will mean more FA's will grow up and not be quite as screwed up as they could be in a culture which has blacked out images they are attracted to.  And of course, that more fat women can be allowed to celebrate their bodies and beauty as they see fit.  If it all works, we can develop something in the fat community that's really better.  But, that might be overly optimistic of me, and I might be seeing what I'd like to see.  Well, a guy can hope, right?

      Just a quick call to all the fat activist oriented individuals posting here.  With the new release of "The Obesity Myth" by Paul Campos, now would be a good time to go to Amazon and post glowing reviews of some classics of Fat Acceptance literature.  If you've read any of the books below, I strongly urge you to post a review.  If you haven't, I strongly urge you to visit the site anyway and mark the positive reviews as helpful and the negative ones as unhelpful.  Its a little thing, but considering how dependable it is for anti-fat acceptance forces to try to use the User Comments section to launch attacks on fat people, its important for us to overwhelm their negativity.  And if you don't have any of the books below, feel free to buy through this link, as I'll get a cut from Amazon.   urlLink The Obesity Myth by Paul Campos   urlLink Fat!So? by Marilyn Wann   urlLink Big Fat Lies by Dr. Glenn Gaesser

      At a discussion forum I sometimes visit, a topic had come up over women's body issues specifically dealing double chins.  Specifically solicited were FA opinions.  Seems the majority FA opinion is that they appreciate them but usually don't focus on them.  Some, however, expressed a specific aversion to them and this just confuses me.  Why on Earth would an FA have a problem with fat?  Its one thing to have a physical ideal (and, yes, I will eventually discuss that after teasing it the other day; just not today) based on preferences, but one based on aversions bugs me.  One reason I have no problem with the term FA is because I do find it very accurate on a basic level.  I'm a fat admirer.  Obviously, I'm looking for more in a relationship, but I don't like FA's who try to justify themselves by acting like thin women are fundamentally bad people.  I think the less read into the preference, the better.  Fundamentally, I'm attracted to fat.  I don't understand how someone could have an aversion to fat as a fat admirer.  Anyway, the discussion also veered a bit into whether you could be self-accepting and have a problem with a double chin.  The answer, as it so often is, is it depends.  Its one thing to struggle with being fat accepting in your own life.  Acceptance is always a journey.  That's something I really hate when I say I'm looking for a woman who believes in fat acceptance.  Some people always immediately respond by cutting me down with "you can't expect someone to be perfect all the time".  I always think, "when the hell did I say anything about perfect?"  I know acceptance is a struggle.  Always is.  What is key is not losing sight of the prize.  Its not always easy.  You'll have  moments of self-doubt and self-hatred.  Its how you respond to those moments that is important.  Its okay to have doubts, but what's not okay is to be complacent in the face of those doubts.  Acceptance is about challenging the voice inside that tells you to hate yourself.  Not accepting the voice.  One thing that really bothers me is that people respond as if I don't have any first hand experience.  I mean, I'm going through this myself.  The double chin is specifically a point of real struggle for me.  I still cringe whenever I see my photo with a double chin.  I tell myself that its just in pictures that it comes out, that its all shadows.  I hate it, but I do it.  But I hate it, and that's what is important.  What I really need to do is desensitize myself to seeing myself with a double chin.  If I get a digital camera, I'll just take a ton of photos of myself to get used to it.  That tactic helped me a lot when I first gained weight.  I've always had a bit of vain streak to me, though I've always had self-esteem issues.  Weird, I know.  But, I looked at myself enough to start accepting what I was.  Seeing something all the time can really help.  I have a very large birthmark on my left-arm for instance.  Goes from my palm to past my elbow.  I see every time I look down.  I'm used to it.  I might be more self-conscious if it was somewhere I didn't deal with all the time.  But, I'm probably being too generous.  The neck up poses a lot more challenges for self-acceptance.  Our face is, well, our face to the world.  Its definetly been my biggest obsticle to self-acceptance for plenty of reasons.  I don't have a very good complexion, and though I'm largely over that, its more a matter of resignation than acceptance.  I also have a couple scars on my forehead from a cat falling on my face (long story) that still bug me.  I hate it, but they still bother me after 15 years or so.  But I do hate that it bothers me, so that's something.

      Sex columnist Dan Savage opens up his letters column with a  urlLink charming little bit of hate speach  from some guy who is just outraged at women wearing low-rise jeans who aren't size 2's.  He's terribly disturbed at having to see "girl love handles".  Does Savage stand up to this spiteful response?  Nope.  He applauds it lovingly.  Fat women just aren't attractive to Dan Savage, and shame on them for not pleasing him.  Except, Dan Savage is gay.  So, why does he care so much about what women need to do to be sexy?  Why is he such an authority on what makes a woman sexy?  I don't get this, but this isn't the only place I've seen the phenomenon.  A lot of gay men seem to consider themselves to be absolute authorities on what is physically attractive for women.  Not all, certainly, but I seem to keep running across this.  I keep trying to tell myself these are exceptions, but they just keep coming up.  One of my earliest encounters with this attitude was in high school with a then closeted gay man (last one to know) who was violently hateful of fat people, especially fat women.  It set a bad tone, and I know I've judged other gay men too harshly because of it.  But, although I haven't seen the extreme of that person, its not like I'm judging people who haven't expressed a some hatred of fat women.  It hasn't always kept me from being friendly with some gay men who express this.  As I've said before, I haven't the luxury of only surrounding myself with fat positive people.  Hell, I can't even manage one, and that's including fat people.  But it still puzzles me why so many gay men would care so much about women who aren't meeting a standard of sexual attractiveness they don't care about anyway.  Have other people seen this, or am seeing more to this than I should?  Anyway, back to Savage.  He goes on to get a dig in on fat people.  Not the first time for him, either.  In his book, "Skipping Towards Gomorrah", he visited a NAAFA convetion to experience gluttony and instead found lust.  He also found some anti-fat activist pushing the line that she was the one who was the "real" fat acceptance.  You know, the one that amputates their digestive system and condemns people finding fat women attractive.  (I admit, NAAFA, especially then, has a lot of problems with objectification of fat women, but you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater)  So Savage has long come out against fat people.  The result?  My outrage has faded into resignation.  Just another self-righteous fat basher.  Why care anymore?  The leaders of "fat acceptance" are always expressing their undying love for fat bashing.  Its hard to care anymore.  This post is all over the place.  Just a lot of frustrations. *sigh*

      Bush has sent out his minions do to some dirty work and stir up trouble over Kerry lying about throwing away his medals in a major protest after he  returned from Vietnam.  You seem, Kerry didn't really throw away his medals.  He throw away his ribbons.  But in 1971, he said medals, so he's a no-good liar who doesn't deserve to be President unlike the saintly G.W. who was obviously doing nothing wrong in 1971.  (cough)  One problem, though.  Its all a great big lie.  Bush's people are counting on ordinary people's definition of medal.  Meaning, those shiny metal things.  Kerry didn't throw those away, but he said medal.  The thing is, the Navy calls the ribbons he did throw away medals.  Kerry was just using the Navy's terminology.  Basically, if you've seen a formal Naval uniform, you may have noticed the field of ribbons worn over the chest.  Every medal given out comes with a ribbon meant to represent the medal.  The Navy regards these ribbons as Medals.  Indeed, given that they are the symbolic representation of the medal, it made sense that Kerry would choose to return those as a symbolic expression of opposition to the continuing Vietnam War.  When Kerry called them medals, he was 100% accurate.  That is what the Navy calls them.  But Bush are counting on people not learning the context and just accepting the 100% dishonest spin they are putting on it about Kerry being a liar.  So, they are lying to call Kerry a liar.  Not that lying hasn't been a major part of their campaign to date, but this is getting even more absurd.

      Hey, remember when I said this was going to be a pop culture blog and I would eventually start a seperate blog for politics?  Oh, you don't?  Well, I once said this was going to be a pop culture blog and I would eventually start a seperate blog for politics.  Forget I said it.  Or, forget I just reminded you I said it.  So, forget I just said this.  I keep wanting to write about politics and its silly of me not to because I want to set up a seperate political blog that I still haven't bothered to start.  So screw it.  So, anyway, today was the  urlLink March for Pro-Choice rights  which drew somewhere in the area of a million people to the mall in Washington.  I'm very happy that there was such a strong turn-out, since there has been such a growing concern of complacency over the issue by some on the left who take pro-choice rights for granted.  Ralph Nader was a big part of this as he as often taken to ridiculing pro-choice advocates and mocking the suggestion that these rights may be at risk, ignoring the plain language of those on the rights.  Meanwhile, the White House response to the March included a "bi-partisan" declaration that all people, regardless of their stance on abortion, could come together to support Bush's attacks on Pro-Choice rights.  Seriously, they did this.  More of W's "bi-partisan" means everyone agrees with me.  But its not getting much play on the blogosphere for a big reason.  Because Karen Hughes, Bush campaign big-wig and former Administration official,  urlLink said this.   Yet again, its all about 9/11.  Yet again, the Bush agenda is cleanly transformed into being all about terrorism.  The Bush folks aren't like the terrorists, and that's why they aren't like us pro-choice advocates.  Because, you know, so many fundamentalist muslims are really into a woman's right to choose.  But this is the same administration that compared teachers to terrorists, so no one is really surprised any more.  The soft bigotry of low expectations is pretty big with the Bushies, don't you know?

      I know I haven't been posting much lately.  Sorry.  Work has been busy with the end of our concert season.  Also I'm just very worn out with looking for a new apartment and trying to find a part-time job.  Asking people for things is, lets just say, not a skill of mine.  I find it extraordinarily stressful so I'm just generally not in a good mood.  It will all work itself out soon, but I'll be happier when its settled.  Knowing it will be settled won't do much for me.  The part-time job thing really is weighing on me.  I know I need to, and I don't mind working retail though something nicer would be, well, nice.  The easiest jobs to find, though, I'm not going to consider.  Telemarketing and food service are non-starters for me, though I might get desperate and apply at Starbucks just because they seem to always be hiring and it could be much worse.  I don't hate food service, but I know how draining it is.  Telemarketing, I hate.  Like I said above, I hate asking people for things.  I did telemarketing for a week as a temp 4 years ago.  Made me sick every night and I did an awful job.  Anyway, there is something I've been meaning to post since Monday.  You see, Monday was what we here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts call Patriot's Day.  Do other states have state holidays?  Massachusetts has two of them.  One isn't a big deal because no one really acknowledges it except the state (St. Patrick's Day is actually a legal holiday in MA; and we wonder where we got our reputation), but not Patriot's Day.  Patriot's Day actually forces a change in Tax Filing many years since it falls near tax day.  The City of Boston basically shuts down (I had to work, but it wasn't very productive since most everyone else was closed) and parties in honor of the Boston Marathon.  As you might guess, Patriot's Day's true origin lies in the American Revolution.  It honors the first skirmishes between Colonials and British soldiers at Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.  Its now a Monday holiday but this year it actually fell on the real anniversery.  Not that anyone really cares about this anymore. (Well, except the Revolutionary War re-enactors)  Now, its just Marathon Monday.  The biggest sports event in Boston, and that's saying a lot considering the devotion Boston holds for the Red Sox, Celtics, Bruins, and Super Bowl Champion Patriots.  Now, every year, some sports freaks start whining about how they don't  get  the Marathon.  But the reasons they don't get it is the same reason I love it and why it draws huge crowds stretched out across 26 miles every year.  I've been lucky to see the Marathon live for each of the last 8 years.  At least some part of it.  I saw the Elites run through 4 of the 8 years, too, though a couple I only got out after work 3 hours after the leaders ran through and once I only watched it from my bedroom window.  Nevertheless, its something I love.  Part of it is the tradition.  This was the 108th race.  And because it is held on Patriot's Day, crowd participation has long been encouraged among all people.  I don't get the feeling other cities have marathons anywhere near as iconic.  The Marathon isn't a disruption.  It isn't something to ignore (not that I think anyone could).  Its something that brings everyone out.  But more than that, its a sporting event where no one is rooting against anyone.  Boston sports fans are infamously bitter and mean-spirited, which makes the Marathon all the better.  This confuses some of those bitter fans, who don't know why they should care if they aren't rooting for someone who might win and if they don't understand why they should care about the Kenyans who've dominated the race in recent years.  Well, for starters, the fact that the Kenyans have so emphatically embraced the Boston Marathon.  They LOVE us in Kenya.  Really, the Boston Marathon is not a perfect Marathon, but the Kenyan runners have completely made it their own.  I'm not entirely sure why, but there is no reason for Bostonians not to love the Kenyans right back and root for them.  But aside from that, the race is all about cheering everyone.  That's why going there 3 hours after the winner passed by isn't an excercise in futility.  Its all part of the fun.  You cheer on these people who've already run 20+ miles.  On Monday, I saw the race from Kenmore Square which is about a mile away from the finish line.  At this point, the runners are almost home.  Easy for us to know, not so easy when you've run 25 miles already.  That's where the crowd comes in.  Even hours after the important stuff, the streets are lined with people cheering on everyone who passes by.  These aren't athletes seen from the Upper Decks in Fenway Park.  They aren't ball-players making millions (not that I have a problem with sports salaries).  They are just regular folks here to compete and they are just a foot away.  You just cheer.  You encourage them.  By name when possible, or at least by t-shirt.  Everyone is in good spirits, everyone is there to have a good time.  Its just a great thing to see and the kind of thing you really need to see for yourself.  One of the reasons I love living in the city.  Well, except that I don't really live in the city anymore, but that's neither her nor there.

Oh, and I'm also enjoying those Brawny commercials.  You know, the one with the "softer" Brawny and the old-school Brawny.  (Softer Brawny: "Look inside yourself.  What do you see?"

      Yeah, I'm whining about flirting again.  urlLink (see here)   I had a near-sex dream last night.  Its funny, I've never actually had a sex dream, but every now and again I'll have a sexual dream.  I'm having trouble figuring out who it was, though.  I recall a blonde BBW who was my roommate.  I actually used to have a blonde mid-size BBW roommate, but I don't think its her.  The dream girl was definetly larger and noticably not a psycho.  Its tough to remember the details, as they are all fading back into nothing.  I was getting a lot of REM sleep last night, though, as it was not the only dream I had some recollection of when I woke up.  I do know it wasn't explicitly sexual, though, but more lightly flirtatious and involving limited clothing.  I just remember it being nice.  Not wild or anything.  But nice.  I had me wanting to be in a relationship again.  I wasn't looking at it from the negative perspective, either. (i.e., why am not in a relationship)  Just a simple little reminder of desire.  And so was my frame of mind while riding on the train (didn't hurt that it was sunny and was going to be beautiful this weekend, though it also didn't help that I've failed in my roommate search and need to find a second job) when I look up and see this cute girl I've been noticing.  Ah, the flirting opportunity.  And what do I do now that I'm in a good mood and not being all negative like I was with the Train station girl?  Nothing.  Yeah, I suck, I know.  But, it didn't feel right.  I mean, I've been checking this girl out for months now (most of which while I was seeing someone and not on the market).  Admitedly, she may not have noticed me at any of these times, but still it would seem oddly timed.  Something about it just feels a little creepy and I'm very hypersensitive about doing things that could be construed as even a little creepy.  I'm especially on guard because I've found myself imagining what her job must be.  She never looks like she's dressed for work, but she's always there on the same route at the same time in the morning.  I figure she works with children.  Its not like she's dressed like a slob, but the clothes look like they are intended for comfort.  She needs to look nice enough for the kids, but still needs to be comfy.  Which all feels like way too much thought for some random girl on the train.  But she is cute.  If I were to imagine my physical ideal, she'd be close.  I technically prefer pale-ish blondes, but have never done so in practice.  Random Girl is all raven-haired and olive skinned, but its not like this was ever a deal breaker.  I grew up in an Italian community so there is no aversion to appreciating a beautiful Italian SSBBW.  Or maybe she's a Latina.  Well, it was really an Italian/latino mixed community.  But that's the closest she goes from my physical ideal.  I'm debating expounding on my physical ideal, but it feels too creepy-ish right now, so I'll leave it at that.  And in all the idle admiration, I've not gotten to the "She hates being fat, she'll hate you for thinking she's beautiful" thing, which is good.  But still, I say nothing.  I think its the train.  Its an awful place to try to flirt.  I mean, if I get shot down, I'm still riding the same damn train everyday.  It'd just be awkward.  But where do people flirt?  Honestly, I'm wondering.  Does this work in these kinds of everyday situations or does flirting only take place in flirting-encouraged scenarios?  Damn TV and commercials for creating an unreasonable expectation of flirtation.

      Sorry, just all this gray is really wearing me down.  Man, they weren't kidding about April Showers this year.  I know, this is some wonderful drought protection and all and that's good, but I really can't wait for it to be over and for the warm weather to return.  My subway train crosses a river on its way into Boston.  Aparently the Mystic River, and thats the first time I've bothered to find that out.  When the skies are clear, the water is this amazingly beautiful deep blue.  Its very out of place for the surroundings.  Heck, one side of the train shows a little industrial area on the river's edge, but still it is something to see.  Lately, its just been this bland colorlessly dreck.  That's the thing about bodies of water.  On a beautiful day, they make it all the more beautiful.  On an awful day, they make it all the more awful.  They play to the surroundings, never making anything nice or making anything bad, just aiming for whatever's already there.  Meanwhile, I'm very close to giving up on finding a roommate.  I have to find one by Saturday and don't have much in the way of strong leads.  Oh, well.  It sucks that I have to pay for my place on my own in May, but I'll get by.  I'm going to try to do some little free-lance graphic design and/or get a retail-ish job to make up the difference.  Wish me luck, and feel free to offer me work.  hehe

      I know my readers have already heard about this elsewhere, but in case anyone new steps in today, Sandy Szwarc has the  urlLink latest in her series of articles dismantling the fat myth up.   A great job, as always, exposing the hideously bad science at play in the crusade against fat people.  Really, go read it.  But here is the short version of the "science" behind the anti-fat movement.  Fat people who die, die because they are fat.  That makes science easy.  And that's not even an oversimplification.  Read it, and read her other articles...   urlLink The Truth About Obesity   urlLink The Skinny on Fat   urlLink The Diet Problem   urlLink Dying to be Thin   urlLink The War on Fat's Casualties   urlLink To Your Health   urlLink Where's the Epidemic?   urlLink Ideal-isms   urlLink To Do List   urlLink A Simple Plan   urlLink A Matter of Health   urlLink Mikey Doesn't Like It   urlLink Killing Turkeys Causes Winter   urlLink Getting Excersised about Excersise   urlLink Shape Up America   urlLink The Emperor's New Crisis

      Again, I further push down my  urlLink big long post.   I guess its more personal than my previous  urlLink big fat post  so I'm both more interested in other's thoughts and expecting fewer comments.  After all, its personal, not a general discussion.  But, I need to get over it and start posting again.  And since this was supposed to be a Pop Cult blog, I might as well post on the topic.  The variet of pop cult?  Movies!  Being girlfriendless, I haven't been really going to the movies lately but there is a backlog of films I want to see rapidly building and I really want to see several films right now.  I've already written off getting to see Lord of the Rings (not happy about that, but oh well), so I want to see what I can now.  My ex-girlfriend was kind enough to offer to pick up some discounted tickets from her employers HR office, so I wanted to figure out what I wanted to see.  I was surprised to find 6 movies out recently or this month, but more surprised that there were only 4 for the rest of the summer.  I'm hardly an anti-Hollywood guy, but I'm just unimpressed with the remainder of the summer blockbusters.  April isn't blockbuster time, so these flicks don't even count.  Its not even like there were films that were close.  I shouldn't be surprised, though.  It was like this last year, too.  Am I more of movie snob than I let on, or do the movies just suck?  An open question.  Anyway, here is what I'm looking forward, too.   Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (OUT NOW): I love, love, love, love Charlie Kaufmann, the screenwriter of this.  I've seen all of his movies. (Being John Malkovich, Human Nature, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, Adaptation) in the theaters and would like to keep that streak going.  I actually own 2 of the 4 on DVD and want the other two.  Though I've been sorta boycotting Winslett since she lost the weight and got viciously fat insulting, but I'll probably suck it up out of my Kaufmann admiration.   Jersey Girl (OUT NOW):  Ah, Kevin Smith.  I'm a HUGE Kevin Smith fan and have been looking forward to this for a while now.  Its gotten some teppid reviews, but I know I like Smith so I'll like the film.  Plus, it just looks good.  Affleck does his best work with Smith, its got a great extended cast, some cool cameos from the sound of it, and I'm quiet excited about seeing it.   The Ladykillers (OUT NOW):  Never saw the original, but my Coen Brothers fandom is second only to my Kevin Smith fandom.  I trust their work to know it will entertain and amuse me.  And Tom Hanks looks like he's having a lot of fun, too.  Another easy call for me.   Hellboy (OUT NOW):  I've got a thing for superheros, as I suspect I've touched on.  Not comic books, mind you, but I love the idea of the characters and enjoy superhero films and tv shows.  Don't know much about the character, but the whole package intrigues me.  The director is really dedicated to the material and passed over a couple VERY high profile jobs to take this one (like Harry Potter), so you have to respect that.  Equally respectable was the casting on Ron Pearleman as the lead.  Its beautfiully unconventional, but perfect casting all the same.  At the end of the day, does a famous face mean anything under so much make-up?  Why not go with a good actor who's look will lend to the character.  Very positive reviews, too.   The Punisher (April 16):  Speaking of Superheros, I'm especially fond of Marvel's core characters and Punisher is one of them.  They made a horrible film out of it way back when, but this looks promissing though tough to pin down.  The source material is tailor made for an action film, but the promos look like its got a lot of poetry to it, as well.  (Visual and story poetry, mind you.  I don't think there will be any E. E. Cummings)  (And yes, E. E.'s name should be capitalized so don't try to correce me. heh)  It could be a very interesting character if done right.   Kill Bill, Vol. 2 (April 16):  My ex-girlfriend HATED the first part with a major passion.  She found it horribly disconcerting, which I can respect.  Tarrentino can be a horrifically violent director, but I can't deny the beauty of his work.  Besides, I want to see how it ends.   Shrek 2 (May 21):  I liked the first one.  Simple as that.   The Day After Tomorrow (May 28):  From the folks who brought us Independance Day, its the return of the great big city destruction genre.  Instead of comets or aliens or Godzilla, this time its weather.  Yep.  A big ass storm is set to destroy the world.  The next Ice Age to be specific.  Not sure how they intend to resolve it, either since its, well, weather.  But it has Jake Gyllenhaal as the lead and I've long enjoyed mass destruction films.  Obviously, such films have been off-limits for a couple years after we, you know, actually saw mass destruction on September 11.  It was tough to enjoy the excitement and terror of the destruction of a city when we actually saw it for real.  When we actually saw the debris cloud engulf a city.  Actually saw an airplane plow into a landmark.  But we're getting back to normal, it seems, so we can stomach watching a massive tornado tear apart and utterly destroy Los Angeles.  Even New York is back in play, as it gets engulfed by tidal waves plowing through Wall Street, depositing tankers on the streets of NYC.  Eventually, Manhatten is incased in ice and snow and we see the disturbing images of a new ice age overtaking the city, sealing the Statue of Liberty.  We see the Public Library destroyed and frozen.  All compelling images and I find it interesting.  ANYWAY...   Spiderman 2 (June 30):  Liked the first, yadda, yadda, yadda.   Anchorman (July 9):  Loved Will Ferrell in Elf, so I'm more than happy to give him a shot in this film.  There are some others I'd consider.  The Village, I, Robot, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Bourne Supremacy, Garfield, The Terminal, Troy etc. but nothing I'm too big into.  Well, that's enough for one day.  Sorry for boring you.

      I was reminded of what I still consider the most insane service ever advertised.  I'm sure it has a point I'm missing, but I guess that's my point.  New from H&R Block!  Do your taxes yourself!  Um, okay.  Close as I can tell, for $35, they'll do the math.  Or rather, some computer program will do the math.  Now, you can by a  urlLink well-known computer program  to do the math for $20, so I still don't get the service.  I even less get the pitch.  Its the commercial all about how some people have the "Do-it-Yourself" gene and now H&R Block has something for them.  Um, okay.  But, I've been doing my own taxes for years.  I'm young enough and make little enough that my return is entirely uncomplicated.  But, if I got complicated and I wanted to do it myself, would I figure that out, ya know, by myself?  Doesn't paying someone blatantly defeat the purpose of Do-it-Yourself?  Especially when they don't seem to be offering much in the first place.  I don't know, I just don't get it.  I mean, "Let us let you do-it-yourself!" just strikes me as a weird pitch.  But I'm all proud of myself, anyway, since I did my taxes a month ago.  Already have my returns, too.  Yay me!

      So, this has really gotten to be more of a personal blog than a pop-cult blog.  Oh, well.  I probably could have seen it coming.  Though I've touched on politics with Fat Acceptance, I've still mostly left that subject off limits as I do want to start a political blog, still.  And this will be for all other wastes of time.  I really need to do it soon, though, because I keep wanting to write something political.  I admire the hell out of the great Poliblogs out there.  I know I can't do what the best of them do, but I'd like to do what I can.  Especially while I'm short of funds and unable to support the causes I really want to support.  Anyway, nothing important.  Just felt like posting and I figured I might as well be done with it.  I'm always hesitant to post after a long one like my last post, but had to do it sooner or later.

      Just warning you ahead of time, I expect this to be a rambling post without any clear direction as I'm basically talking about two things at once.  Its also going to be very very very long.  Sorry.  Oh, and its not an April Fools day prank, either, I just thought it was a catchy (and cliche) post title.  Though its not passed onto April 2, anyway, so it just makes no sense.  I was leaving my train station yesturday and happened to notice a very cute SSBBW waiting out front at the car stand.  I was walking right by her and I found myself in that quiet awe stage that comes just before full-fledged staring.  But really, I was hunting for eye contact.  Flirting has never been a strong point for me in general.  I can do it well enough in a social situation, but cold flirting escapes me.  I think it has something to do with my natural inclination to assume other people aren't interested in having anything to do with me (but that's really another issue).  I can really only think of one time I really did the cold-flirting thing right.  It was at a class picnic my senior year of high school.  We went to this picnic grounds/camp place that was quite popular for this sort of thing.  They let a few different high schools come on the same day and there were all manner of outdoor activities for people to do to their heart's content.  Volleyball, swimming, basketball, tennis, bocce, horseshoes, even a playground and a lake with those foot paddle boats.  So, I notice this cute girl from another high school and I'm quickly smitten.  More significantly, the friend I'm with notices her and immediately realizes I'm checking her out and proceeded to goad me into chatting her up.  That was the cool thing about high school for me.  Everyone knew I was an FA and no one gave me grief about it.  Even people who really didn't get fat acceptance were very genuinely supportive of me.  I had countless friends telling me about the cute fat girl at their college once we all settled into our respective universities.  The friend here was the least likely to be supportive, too.  Very much a Barbie type, although also very sincere and nice though most of my friends never saw that in her.  It was so great to have her being so normal about me checking out a fat girl.  So, I dismissed my instincts with surprising ease and hung out with the girl for most of the rest of the day.  Nothing went on from there, but still.  I felt as if a victory had been achieved.  Regretably, my college was stunningly lacking in BBWs and I also quickly ended up in long-term relationships for most of the last 7 years, so keeping up on my flirting skills was not very tennable.  And yet, I don't think that was the problem as I stood their hoping this cute girl at the train station would make eye contact with me.  I knew what I hoped to do.  I was just going for a quick smile and leave it at that.  Nothing major.  Not really the place.  I was clearly on my way somewhere and she was clearly waiting for someone.  Not a situation that inspires much, but you never know when I might see her again, so it'd just be laying the groundworks.  But, she made eye contact with me, and I quickly flashed a little smile, but just as quickly paniced and looked away.  Not because I was afraid of talking to her.  Wasn't the plan to begin with, after all.  I was afraid she wouldn't want me thinking she was cute.  I really really really hate FA whining, so please forgivie me if I get too self-pitying.  I'm not at all trying to say this in relation to what being a fat woman is, since I know the issues are much worse.  Just so you know.  This isn't meant to be a compartive discussion.  Just about me.  hehe  My biggest problem is that in the last 3 years, I've seen almost exclusively discouragement about being an FA.  Reasons to make me feel that it is utterly hopeless, that no woman really wants to be with an FA.  I worried that she would take my little attempt at flirting with her as an insult.  I know, I know.  "Get over it."  But its not that simple.  Fat negativity has gotten so much worse in the last few years.  Just as it seemed we were turning a corner, it all came crashing down.  I know a lot of my feeling this way has to do with my ex-ex-girlfriend lying to me about this.  For those who don't know the story, I had dated a BBW who believed in fat acceptance.  It was great.  It made me happier than I could have imagined being and I told her that.  Not as a warning, but to show my appreciation and gratefullness.  She took it as a warning, though.  Because eventually, she changed her mind.  Not sure why or how.  I suspect she lost some wait due to feeling sick for a couple months, and it just got addictive.  Pretty soon, she was taking pills, eating less and less, developing an excercise disorder.  She lost a considerable ammount of weight in just a year.  And she didn't tell me what she was doing.  And because I had expressed my opposition to intentional weight loss to her very clearly and was under the impression she agreed, I just figured this was all normal.  Hell, I didn't really notice until she lost 100lbs.  I never suspected anything, either.  I trusted her.  After all, it wasn't about losing weight to me.  It was about the attitudes and beliefs around weight.  And even though her weight-loss measures took over more and more of her life, leaving less and less time for me making me feel lonely and sad, I didn't think she was trying to lose weight.  I figured it just happened.  But, eventually, I stumbled upon the truth.  I went to a site she liked for recipes just to see if I could get any ideas on something we could eat together.  I looked through the forums and I found a post from her detailing the whole story.  I was just in shock.  Especially when I realized that what had been pushing us apart entirely on its own was also something she knew I had strong feelings about.  I know I can't make anyone else's decisions for them, and I wouldn't want to.  But I should get to make my own.  Fat acceptance has always been intensely important to me.  I know I need to be with someone who not only supports this belief in me, but supports it themselves.  I had told her that, and she disregarded my feelings.  And that really hurt a lot.  Everyone always makes out dieting as some kind of grand civil rights issues and we evil Fat Acceptance people want to deny people the right to diet.  Its really just their way of letting us know they want to deny us the right to disagree, because it is utterly absurd to say we have any means to make anyone do anything.  I can't control what she does with her body, but I should get to control who I share my life with.  I have to accept dieting and fat negativity in friends.  I don't want to in a partner.  Its important to me, and I need to share it.  She was welcome to make her choice, but so was I.  She denied me the chance to make that choice and she also denied me the chance, as someone who cared about her, to try to convince her not to do it.  So, I ended it not long after that.  I was hoping she'd finally come clean, but she didn't, so I decided not to bring it up.  The aftermath is that I've become a lot more cynical about finding someone.  When I met my last girlfriend, I really held back a lot of myself, because I was afraid she'd reject it or worse.  Which is a major reason I think our relationship never went anywhere.  It was nice, but never more.  How could I fall in love with someone who I was being careful not to share an important part of myself with?  But, the bigger issue was that I held back not because I was afraid of how she'd react, but because I knew it.  I read enough plain signals and statements to know where she was on these issues.  I tried to act like it didn't matter to me, but I always knew better.  If anything, I'm glad because it really showed me that finding someone who agrees with me about fat acceptance is important to me and its not something I can run away from.  But is it something I can find?  There is so much hostility towards fat acceptance, it can be demoralizing.  I know BBWs often point out that they are easy to find, but FA's don't stand out in a crowd.  Sure, this is true, but its not like every fat woman you see wants to be someone who thinks they are beautiful and will be supportive of them learning to love their body as it is.  Its not what many want to hear.  And finding those who do want that is begining to feel like a very overwhelming challenge.  I put up an ad at a non-BBW related site that is local to the Boston area.  (Go ahead, guess)  I started mentioning all of this in very positive terms, like someone accepting of their size or who doesn't apologize for their size.  This yielded me numerous responses from people who would describe themselves as a "BBW but working on it."  *shudder*  Why would you respond to an ad of someone who is looking for a BBW when you are so negative about it, you'd define it as something you're "working on".  Had one person who was completely incredelous that I didn't fall over myself to congratulate her for losing 150lbs.  Look, as I was saying, I can't make anyone accept themselves, but that also means no one can make me support their non-acceptance.  I cannot support something I know doesn't work, and that's my feeling about dieting.  Anyway, I got progressively more and more explicit about it, and never yielded a response from someone who seemed to get it.  The closest was someone who started their response by lecturing me how I was foolish to expect someone to be perfectly accepting.  Did I say I expected someone to be perfectly accepting?  Nope.  Would I expect it?  Can't expect something I can't be myself.  But they jumped to that conclusion just on seeing me mention that I wanted to be with someone who believed in fat acceptance.  I took this as a bad sign and steered clear.  So, fat acceptance groups as a means of finding a mate?  Well, I'm sure Kell will rightfully take me to task if I suggested using political activism as a dating service.  And some may remember my whole disillusionment with fat acceptance thing.  (more on that later), so that's also an issue.  But even before either of those concerns, the fact remains that Boston isn't the hot bed of political activism San Francisco is.  Or New York, or Seattle I guess, or, um, well its not like there are many hopping communities of fat accepting folks.  Boston's claim to fame is the social scene, which is one of the more active you'll find.  Predictably enough, it was at BBW dances that I met both of my previous girlfriends.  And yet, I feel conflicted about going back to them.  (I also feel noticably automative deficient since they events are all suburban and I am all public transportation dependant)  When I had been to them recently, I felt a profoundly anti-fat sentiment running through the room.  Rather than the safe haven feel I used to see, it now feels at the least abivilant towards fat accepting attitudes, and at worst openly hostile.  I've exaggerated it as a meeting between feeders (which I'm not) and dieters (which I'm also not) and this just leaves me feeling like the odd man out.  At the least, it doesn't solve the problem of finding someone who is on the same page as me with fat acceptance.  Sure, part of me is desperate to go back, but at the same time, another part of me is actively unmotivated.  Why so important?  Couldn't I just give up and dealing with a woman who resigned herself to being fat.  At least until she was next convinced she really should lose weight.  After all, diets have no great track record of success.  If I wanted to play the odds, I'd be pretty comfortable that in the end, no weight loss would occure.  Actually, the odds favor weight gain pretty dramatically, so weight loss isn't long-term concern statistically speaking.  But as I've been saying, its not the weight.  Its the attitude.  I've gotten so much inspiration from the fat acceptance movement and some of its good leaders, like Jennifer Portnick or Marilyn Wann.  It is something I deeply value in my life, but its not something I can do on my own.  I tried that, and many in the movement only inspired me to give up on it as I saw them time and time again coddle and satisfy even the worst bigots.  Short of moving to San Fran, I need to find support in my life somehow for this.  It is a very important part of who I am, and I need to be with someone who wants that.  Who wants to be with someone like that.  They don't need to have the activist trends I do, but they need to agree with me.  Not just humor me.  I need that kind of support, because I don't have a community of support.  I cannot afford to give up that personal support, even if I was willing to sacrafice it.  So what does this mean?  I don't know.  I've just spent 12 hours (no, not straight) getting to this point, and I don't have the energy to look at the next step.  Just ranting without purpose for now.  Thanks for putting up with it.

      There are some weird cars out there.  Not like I have any right to an opinion on automotive aestethics since I don't even have a liscence, but some cars just seem wrong.  It all started with the New Beetle.  But, while at the time, it seemed like it might run the risk of being a very "in the moment" design, I think its held up well.  The design is very classic in its own way, while also anticipating design trends.  Now, it seems everything is designed like that, but the New Bug still feels individual.  It also ushered in an age of inventive car design.  Odd that something that started with the beautifully round Beetle has yieled so many annoying boxy cars.  I've kinda warmed up the Honda Element.  I hated it at first.  Those plastic side panels just put me off.  But, its grown on me.   The new Scion cars from Toyota, however, are just dreadful.  I wanted to like the Element right away, I just didn't.  The Scion cars are just obnoxious.  They are litterally boxes on wheels.  It hurts me to look at those things.  Someone in my neighborhood drives one, and he looks very intetionally trendy, which seems to be the target demo.  I don't get it, though.  Its just an ugly looking car.  Also ugly are the new PT Cruiser convertables.  That's just a car which shouldn't be.  I was never a huge fan of the PT, but I didn't really hate it, either.  But the idea of an SUV-ish, station-wagon-is convertable?  Who the hell thought of that?  Its not like they made the unlikely work, either.  It is just disturbing.  It looks like some weird West Coast chopped car with its top up, and just generally seems out of place.  Its just not a car meant for the convertable treatment.  I'm amazed that wasn't obvious.  But its not just car makers coming up with ugly cars.  Drivers get in on the act, too.  I saw the most amusingly absurd car accessory today.  A boxy, older, grey Honda Civic with a full-fledged racing spoiled tacked onto the hood in defiance of all logic and purpose.  Not even one of those understated spoilers often seen on newer sedans of a more pedestrian design.  (hehe, get it)  No, this thing was jacked up a good foot, flaring out for all the world to see.  Honestly, how does that make sense when you own an old, grey Honday Civic?  Bizarre.

      My life has been oddly sychronized the last few days.  I'm sure there must be a word for this phenomenon that I'm just not clever enough to know, but 3 times in just the last two days I had a weird moment where something came up that I had been talking about earlier.  Not ordinary things, either.  Let me explain...  So, I'm chatting with a nice young woman the other day and she expresses her love for Karaoke.  A unique passion, for the most part.  It was probably the only time that karaoke came up on conversation for me in over a year.  And then last night, I was talking with my ex-girlfriend and she mentioned being at a BBW dance and some guy kept bugging her about whether she liked Karaoke.  Seemed funny at the time, but probably just coincidence.  Then last night, I was talking about my Orange Coverse Chuck Taylor All-Star sneakers and was asked by a friend if they made plaid ones anymore.  So, I checked out their website.  Failing to find plaid ones, one pair did catch my eye.  A really cool pair of black Chuck Taylors with  urlLink a cool flame design.   A very unique design that I've seen before online I liked, but have nevery actually seen.  I liked them enough to send the specific address for those sneakers to my friend.  So what do I see this morning on my way to work?  Yep, a guy wearing those very sneakers.  Also when talking to my ex last night, she recommended the moving company she used and I figured I'd finally look into it just in case my friend flaked out on helping me move.  So I contact them for a quote.  She'd mentioned them before, but I never really paid attention.  They are a biggish moving company, but I don't think I'd ever heard of them or seen them.  So they got back to me pretty quickly to let me know that they were booked for this weekend.  And what should I see parked across the street from my office?  A truck from this moving company.  None of these were too bizarre and probably all just coincidences, but still odd in their repetition.  Is coincidence the right word for this?  Doesn't seem quite right to me.  Just thought I'd share.

      Okay, I'm the last person to participate in self-pitying for fat admirers, but one little stat in Paul Campos' book stuck out at me.  I've always been told how easy it is for FA's because there are so many fat women and so few FA's.  Its funny, because this is about the only thing I don't think works out in the FA's favor.  Everything else FA's complain about just strike me at non-issues.  But, the breakdown of FAs and BBWs just didn't feel quite right to me.  Why was I having such problems finding the right woman if this were so?  Was I some kind of a loser or something?  But, a ha!  The stats didn't tell the whole story.  Because most fat women are chronic dieters and not likely to be interested in someone like me.  And besides, I'm not interested in dating a chronic dieter.  I believe in fat acceptance, even if not in the movement, and thats something I want to share with whoever I'm with.  At least on some level.  According to statistics Campos cites, as many as 93% of fat women are dieting at any given time.  That leaves 7% remaining that I could be a match for.  7% out of 31% of women who are fat.  By my math, that means just over 2% of women are potential matches for me.  That's not even getting into more general compatibility issues.  (I said I was going to write a post about what I'm looking for in a woman, didn't I?  Might still get around to that).  Now, I've seen it quoted that 10% of men are attracted to fat women.  I suspect this number to be less than perfect, especially since it probably comes from Dimensions Magazine.  Let's be generous and say its closer to 7%.  So, that's 7% of guys interested in 2% of women. Self-accepting women enjoy a 3 to 1 advantage in finding a mate!  Quite a different story then the annecdotal observations of male/female rations at BBW dances.  I kinda prefered not realizing that.  Oh well.

      "Much like their Calvinist spiritual ancestors, those who prosecute the war on fat treat the most extreme forms of intolerance as the surest signs of virtue.  And, as we shall see, in their unwillingness to brook dissent, their eagerness to sniff out heresy, and their ultimately tragic devotion to a task that can neither by completed nor abandon, those who have transformed the Protestant work ethic into the American diet ethic are worth heirs to a tradition of life-warping fanaticism."   -Paul Campos, Introduction to  urlLink "The Obesity Myth."    As I believe the kids are fond of saying: word.

      So, anyway...  I'm having a weird month.  I'm being very manic-depressive, I think.  One moment I'm feeling happy and frolicky, and the next I'm firing off a whiney email to Aimee.  (Sorry, Aimee).  One moment I'm feeling defeatist about dating, the next I'm happily chatting up a very nice young woman.  First I'm exciting about my new retail job (at Target), then I'm overwhelmed by my schedule, then I'm thinking its no big deal.  One day I'm giddy over some new toys (and remember, when I say toys, I actually mean toys), and then in the same day I'm overwhelmingly anxious over money.  Just lots of these little shifts in mood.  Its not really driving me crazy yet, but I'm definetly noticing it.  Hopefully, June will bring more balance.

      I'm finding it very disturbing the way some people (specifically in the fat acceptance movement) have decided to take such an unserious approach to some critics of fat acceptance who have taken to fantasizing about the deaths of people they don't agree with.  Limitless bandwidth seems to be perpetually wasted on hand-ringing over whether Fat Acceptance is being nice to dieters who claim to be "afraid" to express their opinion because some people will disagree with them and that might upset the dieters.  Its a mind-numbingly stupid arguement, and yet its one fat activists repeatedly allow themselves to get dragged into.  What is all the more amazing about this is the incredibly low standard these seem people seem to expect from the critics of fat acceptance.  For them, it would seem even death wishes are no problem.  I get chastized for having a problem with it.  What?  Because publicly hoping for the death and/or damnation of people you disagree with is okay in polite society?  Anyone who has seen the agressive victimhood put on by people I disagree with, tell me, how do you think those people would have responded if I had wished them dead?  These people who act like I'm hell spawn for just disagreeing with them, what do you think their response would be if I had instead gone into detail about how I hoped they would die and how wonderful their death would be.  I'm guessing they might be just a bit upset.  And for once, they'd be right.  I'm sensitive to death threats.  Not sensative as in over-sensitive, but as in personally aware of how serious they are.  Simply put, its happened to me before.  Full on Death Threats, so I'm certainly not condemning the death wishes lightly.  They may not be as horrible as death threats, but that is hardly great praise.  In high school, 3 seperate men threatened to kill.  Not surprisingly, it was always over a girl.  The first two were in my freshman year.  The first was a guy who was dating a girl I used to go out with but I had a big blow up with (apparently caused by a lie my brother told).  He wasn't trying to avenge her, though.  He just didn't want me honing in on his action.  Of course, it came to pass that I and the girl patched things up and became close friends and she dumped him within a day.  Suffice to say, I was always a little worried if he was going to follow through.  The most bizarre thing is that after threatening me, he asked me for a ride home.  I can't make that up!  Did it right in front of my mom, too, so I couldn't very well tell him no.  I think that scared me more than anything.  That he would do that after threatening to blow my head off.  Most people who employ death threats or death wishes are essentially cowards of course.  They'll never do anything.  They just want to intimidate people they cannot control.  The sad thing is, though, it works.  It takes a troubled mind to regard life and death so casually.  People who insist to me this guy was harmless, all talk no action.  And they had a point.  The guy clearly has a major problems and was a pathological liar.  But, I just didn't find being threatened with death by someone who was mentally unstable to be of much assurance.  Which was again a problem with the second threatener.  He was very out of the blue.  I had absolutely no idea who he was, but one day he shows up outside my math class and tells me he'll kill me if I bother a close friend of mine.  Did this in front of people, too.  He was a senior at the time, and I would soon learn he knew quite a few friends of mine through the neighborhood or something like that.  He got it into his head that I broke the heart of this close friend of mine, or something like that.  She was a good friend, but that's all we ever were.  Others saw us as a prospective couple, but neither of us did.  I guess he did, though.  He repeated the threat a few days latter, again in front of someone.  I was walking down the hall with a guy I'd known since Kindergarten who also knew this nut-job.  He just walked up, said hi to my friend, and then told me he was going to kill me.  This isn't fun, people.  Again, I was assured that he was just a nutcase and not to worry.  Again, "he's a nutcase" did little to reassure me.  This guy went on to get himself thrown out of the military for impersonating an officer if the high school grapevine was accurate.  The time I was in the most danger, I felt the least worried.  This happened my senior year.  Its also the only time I wasn't directly threatened, which no doubt helped.  But it was the only threat from someone who'd proven himself dangerous.  He didn't really know who I was, thankfully, and he never got a chance to learn.  The less said about him, the better, and I'm going to just leave this at that.  I have far too much experience with this before I was even 18.  I know how it makes you feel.  I know the fear.  I know the disgust.  And I cannot understand why some people can treat wishing someone dead like it was a harmless joke.  No, I don't think going on about how great my impending death would be is the same as what I went through in high school.  But again, that's damning praise.  It still shows a stunning lack of regard for human life.  To wish death upon those who disagree with you is horrific.  It may be less frightening than when someone explicitly threatens your life, but it is no less objectionable.  What's more, it is something which ought to be condemned by even the death wisher's allies.  Condemned in no uncertain words.  If you allow for an atomosphere where wishing death upon those who disagree with you can occur, you are genuinely no better than those who express them.  A community which can allow such violent fantasies to go unquestioned is a community which deserves no respect.  This was not an isolated incident.  It happened three times.  Only one comment was ever made, and it was a *positive* comment.  It was not in the midst of a heated discussion.  These were people talking amongst themselves.  None of the people they wished dead were in the discussion.  It was calm and deliberate and not a single person said anything about it.  That is sickening.  And yet, I'm told this is my problem.  I'm told I'm some kind of militant for not liking that people wish fat activists death for their support of fat acceptance.  I'm treated as if these offenses are meaningless.  How can our morality be so skewered as to accuse people of not being willing to accept anyone who doesn't agree with them 100% for merely disagreeing with someone, and yet when our critics fantasize about deaths we not only do nothing but we attack anyone who has a problem with the death wish crowd.  It is sick and immoral, and that's why I've got no remaining faith in fat acceptance.  If our critics starting bringing up their desire for our death, we're the ones who get attacked?  By the people supposedly on our own side?  Its wrong.  It is unforgivable.  And the complacency of some of the absentee leaders of fat acceptance is deplorable.  As are the actions, frankly, of the followers who allow the leaders to get away with this.  I may still believe in the philosophy, but I have no regrets turning my back on the movement.  When its priorities are so disturbingly misplaced, the movement doesn't deserve anyone's faith.

      It has been occuring to me that part of the disease in fat acceptance is to paint people who are simply looking for respect for their beliefs into warriors for ideological purity.    Its always made out to be about 100% acceptance of the philosophy when the issue is the coddling of people who are 100% opposed to the philosophy.  They want to act like they are just reaching out to people who simply don't agree 100%, but that's just not true.  In turn, they attack and belittle anyone who doesn't like their favoring of anti-fat folks into some sort of militant purists who won't accept anything less but perfection.  Indeed, what they are doing is shifting the discussion in a direction which only encourages people to call for greater ideological purity in a desperate attempt to get the discussion back onto fair ground.  By trying to define the discussion so far into their direction, the people in charge create exactly what they claim to be against.  It is a point of complete shame that these people will spare no effort in attacking the people who believe too much while they refuse to expend any effort in confronting those who do not believe at all and who are only here to be counterproductive.  Its a fraudulent way of discussing the issue.  My problems at NAAFA and Big Fat Fraud were never with the people who straddled the line.  It was with the people who jumped right over it.  I may not have been too fond of the line strandlers, but they generally can be reasoned with.  Or at least, confronted on the issues.  The only people I ever had an outright problem with didn't believe in Fat Acceptance at all.  This isn't me seeing the world in black and white, just being able to recognize black from grey.  I can understand giving people a good ammount of leeway, but there should be a point where enough is enough.  Regretably, the people controlling most Fat Acceptance discussions only seem interested in drawing the line at those who agree with the movement, not those who continually attack it and frequently burst into open hostility towards it.  This is the problem with the NAAFA trolls.  They are people who've always expressed disdain and dissatisfaction with Fat Acceptance and who continually misrepresent it to justify their attacks.  These aren't constructive contributers.  My issues at BFB were with someone who publicly called for people to harass me at a site founded and led by someone who participated in fat hate attacks that were below childish.  A site which fostered at atmosphere of violent hatred towards fat acceptance  That is not a shade of grey.  That is not defining a troll as someone who doesn't totally agree with me.  I think when you are advocating people harassing me, its gone MUCH past not totally agreeing with me.  But, Paul believes in the power of dishonesty, and holding people accountable for their own words and deeds qualifies as an "unprovoked attack".  So long as the person lies at BFB, they can participate in all the hate they want to everywhere else.  It isn't "radical" to think we should recognize those who are intentionally destructive for what they are.  I don't agree with a lot of Kell's positions about keeping things on message.  I do agree that a lot of times, she's quick to dismiss people who can be engaged and educated.  But I understand how she got to this point.  The first problem is not Kell's, but rather those who were too quick to embrace those who have clearly demonstrated (or outright stated) their condemnation of fat acceptance.  Yes, seeing things only in black and white is a problem, but the original problem are those who refuse to see the black and white at all, and insist everything is grey.  Doing this only makes those who do see the black and white want to see them all the more clearly and encourage them to miss the grey.

      So, I'm on the train this morning and I look up and see that someone has affixed a sticker onto one of the ad posters on the train.  Then, someone else had written onto of the offending sticker with a Sharpee.  I didn't think much of it until I realized the writing was very carefully positioned only on-top of the sticker.  I figured it'd be worth my while to bother to read the darn things now.  The sticker was promoting the Workers World Party, a Communist orgnazing group.  The graffiti atop it was "Trotskites".  I found that impressive.  Who even knows to use Trotskites to go after Communists any more?  Moreover, its apparently quite accurate.  The WWP is ideologicially linked to Trotsky.  On the one hand, I believe in the free exchange of ideas, but on the other hand the WWP had put up graffiti of their own so its hard to feel too bad for them, and besides that I really strongly oppose communists and was impressed with the graffiti artists knowledge of Communism.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big supporter of Socialism as it exists in the US Government or in some of our good allies like Canda or Brittain, but Communism and Marxism were just plain wrong.  So, horray for intellectual graffiti artists on the subway!

      There is basically nothing I watch Sunday's at 10pm, especially with Cartoon Network offering nothing worthy in the slot.  So, I was flipping and caught the start of "The Practice", the first I've seen of the show since it  urlLink jumped the shark  when it made its two leading characters into murders in the span of a year AND let them both get away with it.  When the hell did this show become a sitcom?  Honestly, I'm a 20 minutes in and its been all comedy, mostly from people who never had anything to do with this show.  Mafia comedy.  Sex perversion comedy.  Drug Comedy.  Violence Comedy. Disability Comedy.  William F'in Shatner Comedy.  I'm not sure a show has ever devolved like this before, while having the audacity to still call itself by its original name.  Supposedly, they are remediying this next year with a "spin off" that presumably just picks up where this leaves off but without the whole "The Practice" bagage.  Though, it does sound like they are keeping up the flimsy pretense of a drama when the show is so obviously a sitcom.  Though, I hear someone actually from the original cast is trying to angle her way into an honest to goodness sitcom.  Has that ever even happened?  I know a couple of sitcoms have spawned drama spin-offs, but never the other way around.

       urlLink Kell notices that the trolls have resurfaced  at Big Fat Fraud.  Which sheds new light on a cryptic comment I got yesturday.  Surprise, surprise, its none other than "Mary" who attacked my old blog on a daily basis for a good four months AND who visited a fat hate site to encourage others to cyberstalker and succeeded in getting at least one to do just that.  Mary's posts at BFB were uniform in their effort to be counterproductive or actively destructive.  She was attempting to be the kind of undercover troll that fat hate site likes to promote.  Always trying to turn the conversation away from productive discussions and into fat negative nitpicking.  Given her history attacking me, however, I saw through her act in about a second.  Paul, however, didn't care that she was a fat-hating cyber-stalker.  He repeatedly favored her destructive screeds and eventually suspended for reminding people that she was a hate-monger.  FYI to Kell, Paul never banned me.  I left in disgust when he decided to side with that bigot over someone who actually believed in fat acceptance.  A disgust only increased when I discovered that Paul himself was going to that fat hate site to suck up the bigots there and encourage one of their ring-leaders to come to Big Fat Fraud.  Not surprisingly, she didn't receive a warm welcome so Paul had to apologize to the hate-monger because some people recalled her hateful attacks on size acceptance.  (Ranging from silent approval of violent fantasies on multiple occassions, co-founding her hate site with a real scum bag who organized a massive troll attack against NAAFA that lasted months, to mean-spirited name calling directed at Marilyn Wann)  Remember, these are the kinds of hate-mongers Paul approves of.  Fat acceptance supporters are the kinds of people Paul is quick to silence.  All why I stand by my mourning of fat acceptance.  There are two many fake supporters like Paul McAleer who show nothing but contempt for the movement while showing extreme support for the most craven hate-mongers.  I hate it, because the beliefs still mean so much to me, but the movement has completely lost me out of its complete unwillingness to even stand by their right to their opinion, much less the beliefs themselves.

      Okay, weird thing.  I just turned on the TV and saw some comedian on Showtime at the Apollo.  He started in doing a routine on the absurdity on turkey ham.  What I actually wanted, though, was Comedy Central.  So I change the channel.  What do I get?  A completely different comedian, just starting in on a routine on the absurdity of turkey ham.  Weird.

      Yeah, I know I haven't been posting.  Though, no one is probably reading so it all evens out.  So this will be a bit of a random assortment of stuff post as I catch up.  First off, I will never buy scented Fabreeze again.  Well, actually its pseudo-Fabreeze from ALL.  God, it stinks.  I sprayed it two hours ago and I'm still sick from the smell.  Anyway, I was getting very gung ho about going to NYC, but my enthusiasm is plummeting.  After doing everything but buy my bus tickets, I started realizing that I really didn't want to spend 9 hours on a bus in a single day.  I really do want to visit the Whitney, but I'm just not sure I can justify that.  I usually can't justify the 45 minute train ride into Boston unless I'm going to work.  The idea of spending 9 hours on a bus, an additional 2 hours waiting for buses, ANOTHER additional 2 hours getting two and from the bus station in Boston, and I'm looking at spending 13 hours just so I can get 6 hours in New York.  Not sure my rate of return is high enough there, no matter how much I want to do it.  And I was finally going to walk through Central Park and everything!  Oh, well.  In mundane personal news, I've got a part-time job.  Not the interesting part-time job I was hoping for, but rather sales floor work in the Women's Clothing section of Target.  Eh.  Its a living.  And I'm getting paid more than I expected, so that's a small (very small) comfort.  Plus I get the employee discount, which should come in handy enough.  I've also found a place to live.  Woo hoo!  Great apartment, great roommates I know I'll get along with, nice neighborhood, great view from my bedroom, just a lot to feel positively about.  I'll probably post more about that eventually.  Its also been a banner week for the couple of video game franchises I enjoy.  The good folks at EA Games/Maxis released a neat utility for their upcoming  urlLink Sims 2  game.  Basically, it allows you to create characters for the game and is mostly a test drive for the new character creation tools.  I'm really impressed.  I was able to create a computer character that looked very realisticly like me, right down to the details of my face and nose.  I just hope I can go in and add some of my scars and birthmarks, because I get geeky like that.  One thing I loved is that they thought to put in a tool that would allow you to add a double chin.  Its damn realistic looking, too.  I've never seen this before, as usually you just have to blow up the face to get a "fat" look, but I'm very impressed.  I'm less impressed that the game's "fat" bodies are still noticably not fat.  Especially the woman's body.  My virtual doppleganger deserves a VBBW!  Oh, well.  Speaking of fat video game characters, a torrent of news has been released about the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,  urlLink GTA: San Andreas .  One minor tidbit is that the game requires you to eat to keep up your stamina, but if you eat too much, you can get fat and this will slow you down and result in you getting verbally attacked when you walk down the street.  *groan*  The solution, of course, is going to a gym and working out.  Its an interesting twist on video game's stamina regulation, and the fattened character looks more realisticly fat than most fat characters in video games, but I'm really annoyed that dieting is getting built into a video game.  Sims 2 may have the same thing, actually, and I'll be more annoyed with that.  Other than that, the new GTA game looks very cool.  Set in early 90's California, the game deals more with street gangs than the earlier use of conventional organized crime.  They are also seriously pushing the evelope on what a game like this is capable of.  If you've played Vice City or GTA III, you're no doubt impressed with how expansive and open-ended the environments are.  GTA:SA goes much further.  Instead of playing out in 1 city, its not spread across a whole state with three distinct urban environments, each larger than the whole of Vice City.  Plus, you have to drive through the country side to get from town to town.  How cool is that?  The game takes you from a psuedo Los Angelas to San Fran to Las Vegas.  Its also the first GTA game to feature a black main character, and I'm curious to see how some of the white suburban fan base takes to that.  Early word is that there is clearly some racially motivated distaste going on, which is ironic since it sounds like the game will deal head-on with race issues in the inner city.  It also sounds like the plot will deal more with the noble crooks of GTA III instead of the Scarface inspired drug dealing of Vice City, which is a nice switch.  The screenshots look gorgeous and engrossing, and I can't wait for its October release.  Hmm.  What else.  I haven't discussed TV lately, which is a shame since there are several things I wanted to talk about, including the end of  Friends  and the return of the  Dick Van Dyke Show  and the impending end of  Angel .  For another day, perhaps.

      I think I mentioned here that I'm looking for an apartment and a 2nd job.  Still looking for both, but hoping for an answer soon.  Hoping to, actually, as a dearly want to get down to New York City in May.  Couple of reasons.  Most importnatly, I want to go to the  urlLink Whitney Museum of American Art's Biennial Exhibition.   I went to the last one in 2002 (part of the post 9/11 NYC tourist boom) and I really loved it.  Didn't even expect to go.  Just something I did on a lark.  It was in the right place, essentially.  Their Biennial is essentially an overview of whats going in Art in America.  It is incredibly expansive, but I enjoyed that.  It was a deep retrospective that sort of intimidates you if you don't, well, introspect.  Its more of a sampler of what's going on.  That just really worked for me.  I especially enjoyed the installation art, which is simply something you can't enjoy from a book.  Its not usually my thing, but I really did enjoy it.  So I decided then that I wanted to make going to the Biennial "my thing".  But alas, its just not worked out too well and I'm running out of time.  Funds have been short, work has been busy, and I always planned to do it in May but now everything is in flux for me and I want to get that all settled first.  Even still, I'm not sure I've got the money.  But, then I remembered that May is the month when FleetBoston allows their bank customers free admission to a slew of museums in the northeast.  Including the Whitney!  Well, actually no, the Whitney wasn't on the list.  BUT the Met was, and I do enjoy the Met, too.  So, now I'm thinking about going in early on the cheap bus, then getting out late (though, it probably won't need to be too late) after hitting the Met and the Whitney.  Just have to figure out how much it will cost, but I'm frankly pretty detirmined to do it.  $10 bus to Boston, get to NYC at 11:30 $5 lunch in NYC at some conveniently cheap location $7 Metrocard for the day $12 Admission to the Whitney $10 cheap dinner $10 bus back to Boston, leave NYC at 7:00pm  Total: $54.  And frankly, dinner should only cost me $5.  But that gives me room to pick up som H&H Bagels.  I can do that.  I think.  A lot of traveling for one day, though.  But, I think it'd be worth it.  Something to think about.

      So, have I mentioned going to Amazon.com to review  urlLink "The Obesity Myth"  yet?  Promise, last time.  I just wanted to stress that its important to check the site regularly AND to encourage others to do the same.  The word is out in the anti-fat crowd and they are bashing the book early and often, obviously without reading a word.  Its really important right now to keep on them and make sure others see that these uninformed negative attacks do not reflect the book's value.  I'll be getting the book next week and can't wait to write my own review.  Until then, vote the positive reviews as helpful and the negative reviews as unhelpful.  Thanks everyone!

      Well, okay, so maybe I don't really have a great mind, but two bonafide great minds on fat acceptance, Marilyn Wann and Jennifer Portnick, had the same idea I did about running to Amazon.com to post reviews.  Predictably, the anti-fat folks are out front on this, too, so its all the more important to go there and post your own reviews of the new Paul Campos book as soon as you've read it.  And go right now to mark the fat haters' reviews as unhelpful.   urlLink The Obesity Myth by Paul Campos   urlLink Fat!So? by Marilyn Wann   urlLink Big Fat Lies by Dr. Glenn Gaesser   And while you're at it, Barnes and Noble does customer reviews, too, so swing on over there and offer your opinion.   urlLink The Obesity Myth by Paul Campos

      So, I'm watching NBC's ratings gimmick, er, TV Movie,  10.5  because I've got a thing for disaster movies.  I missed the start when they destroyed Seatle, but I caught the start of the destruction of Northern California.  Some of it has been watchable, but other parts have been absolutely embarassing.  Especially as it can't seem to stop adding side stories which keep collapsing back onto themselves.  The silliest thing though was a scene shot like a chase scene from a monster movie as the Earthquake follows a train and eventually catches up to it and takes it down.  The "earthquake" was the old fashioned tear in the earth style which trailed exactly along the train tracks and then conviently stopped once it ate the train.  Another thing I've noticed is that President Beau Bridges is remarkably Bush-esque, focusing more on strong leadership then getting the facts right.  The movie is pushing this as a strength, but its not hard to see another side to it.  Also, I'm officially declaring  urlLink John Schneider  a "movie star" style actor.  Which is funny because he's not a movie star, but I'm sticking to it.  For me a "movie star" style actor is some who basically doesn't act.  They just go out and be themselves and rely on the strength of their persona.  Ever think of an actor who's performances are all the same?  They aren't an actor.  They are a "movie star".  Alec Baldwin and Ben Affleck are two of the most noticable examples.  Think about it.  Isn't Alec Baldwin always basically doing the same thing?  Its always just Alec Baldwin mugging for the camera, which is enjoyable enough.  Schneider has just enough star power to pull it off, but only just enough.  But its fine, because he's settled into the world of television.  His work in 10.5 is so identical to his work on Smallville that's almost tough to keep up.  Its all the same schtick.  I like it an all, so I'm willing to look at it as "movie star" acting instead of a lack of ability.  More later.

      Just wanted to update my little Political Round-up post the other day.  Governator backed off on the whole killing puppies things.  Guess it finally occured to him what he was suggesting.  The Vice Presidential Dick apologized for telling Senator Leahy to go fuck himself and expressed his shame at using such langugage in the halls of the Senate to attack an elected representative of the people.  Oh, wait, no that didn't happen.  He expressed a deep sense of satisfaction, no regret, said he felt better having cursed out a Senator, and that it was something that "badly needed to be said" and was "long overdue".  Majority Leader Bill Frist thinks there is no problem with this because it is an election year and people are just being passionate.  And then he proceeded to slam Democrats for their lack of civility.  Not really.  Well, not quite, anyway.  Civility, of course, is Republispeak for staying quiet while you bend over and get fucked up the ass.  Big time.  So remember, feel free to tell Republicans to go fuck themselves.  Their party leadership considers this just the kind of discourse that is long overdue, so feel free to give them what they want.  And speaking of civility, Ralph Nader is in the news again.  He's calling Michael Moore a  urlLink "giant beach ball"   Nader's bitchy because Moore is distancing himself from Nader because he doesn't support his Presidential campaign.  So Nader responded in the adult way by releasing an open letter  urlLink mocking the director's weight  and bragging about how he and his friends are "trim and take care of themselves".  Democrats and Republicans are like?  Seems more like Dick and Ralph have a lot in common.  But remember, the progressive war hero is completely unacceptibly liberal.  We need someone like Nader who hates fat people,  urlLink mocks gays and women,  ignores blacks,  urlLink busts unions, abuses employees,   and invests in corporations that engage in  urlLink genocide, war profiteering, sexual discrimination, exploitation of the oil market, weapons production, and price gouging on medications.   Because nothing says progressive better then, well, all that.  Real class act that Nader.  Just remember his "giant beach ball" remark the next time some self-righteous Naderite whines about how put upon Ralph is.

      I’ve been pondering my fat admiration lately.  On the off-chance an uninitiated has stumbled in here (by the way, welcome), this is basically referring to the fact that I’m attracted to fat women.  The preferred term for this is usually “fat admirer” although some hallow objections are occasionally raised about how it should something like bbw admirer (Big Beautiful Woman: read Fat Woman) or Fat Woman Admirer.  I think that’s redundant myself.  All heterosexual men should be women admirers.  If they aren’t, that’s a problem.  It has nothing to do with FA’s in particular.  Essential, Fat Admirer is just a simple and quite concise explanation of the point of difference.  I admire fat.  I find it aesthetically pleasing in all of its forms.  Now, I want to be with a woman who intellectually stimulates in addition to physically stimulating me, but that’s beside the point.  FA is just a little label meant to define one simple thing.  Calling myself a fat creative funny intelligent progressive maybe with glasses probably with a small chest a bit short who is accepting of her body and rejects intentional weight loss woman admirer gets pretty damn unwieldy, don’t you think?  And who could really use FCFIPMWGPWASCABSWIAOHBARIWLWA as an abbreviation, anyway?  So, like I was saying, I’ve been pondering my fat admiration lately.  I’ve put up a personal ad at a general use site that’s notoriously fat unfriendly but has a wide readership.  I’ve gotten some interesting response, which is nice for a change, but it occurs to me that I’ve never really considered how specific my physical type might be.  Its not really been an issue for me in a long time.  I sorta fell into my last two relationships and both women were relatively similar physically.  I definitely liked it, so I wonder if that’s really my type now.  I used to always point out that I was attracted to women 200lbs and over to demonstrate how non-limiting being an FA was in comparison to being, well, a thin admirer.  Some like to act as if being attracted to fat women is some kind of ultra-specific fetish.  Why?  Because I have a range of 400lbs that I find attractive where most guys are lucky if they have a range of 40lbs?  Anyway, I guess I’m wondering if I might be a bit more specific than I realize.  I find smallish fat women aesthetically pleasing, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not sure there is a real sexual attraction there.  I think it just sort of stops at the aesthetic point, though.  Like, “that’s cute” but not progressing to “that’s hot.”  But I’m not sure I really have a more specific point.  I mean, I definitely know I’m a belly man, but I’d never really thought about a specific point where sexual attraction really begins.  I guess I’m more, “I’ll know when I see it”.  I’d guess around 300, but I can too easily think of exceptions below that point.   And when it comes to physical attraction, I think being a belly man is more important to me than any specific weight.  But both are easily trumped in importance by a woman who is accepting of herself.  But, I don’t feel like I can just give up on the “total package” yet.  Which reminds me, I was supposed to write a post detailing what I’m looking for in a woman.  Maybe that’s what I should have done instead of fussing over the difference between being aesthetically pleased with a fat woman, and being sexually attracted to a fat woman.  But, for another day, now.

      In the words of Ben Folds,  urlLink "Yeah, well fuck you, too!"   In case you haven't heard, Dick Cheney told Senator Leahy of Vermont to "go fuck himself" on the floor of the Senate the other day.  And what did Leahy say to get Dick all worked up.  "Hello".  This launched Cheney into attacking Leahy for criticising his dealings with Halliburton.  In response, Leahy expressed his displeasure with the Bush administration calling him a bad Catholic for opposing Bush's judicial nominees.  To which, Dick responded as only a Dick can with "go fuck yourself."  The Administration has taken to euphamisitically calling Cheney's blow-up a "frank exchange of ideas".  Yeah, way to go on that whole restoring dignity to the White House thing.  And good ol' Ralph Nader continues to destroy what remains of his reputation.  Aside from his self-serving and absurd endorsement of John Edwards as John Kerry's running mate (Edwards is unquestionably more of a moderate than Kerry), he clearly knows who really supports his campaign.  Republicans.  Out in Oregon,  urlLink reports  are coming in that the Bush/Cheney campaign is actively soliciting people to attend a Nader signature drive.  A script has also gotten out from  urlLink Citizens for a Sound Economy  where they explicitly urge people to try to get Nader on the ballot in order to jointly defeat John Kerry.  Nader's spokespeople have said they don't see anything wrong with this.  In case you're curious, CSE is Republic special interestes group financed by corporate money and run by Dick Armey.  You may remember him as the Republican attack dog/Majority Leader who called gay Massachusettes Congressment Barney Frank, Barney Fag.  Remember, this is all *after* Nader failed to generate support on his own to get a place on the Oregon ballot.  They have a rule where you can bypass the law require thousands of signatures if you get 1,000 at one event.  Nader went for the easy way and failed.  Now he's going for the easy way with explicit support from far-right-wing corporate interests.  And lets also not forget that down in  urlLink Arizona  Nader is likely to get knocked off the ballot as over 32% of signatures gathered appear to be invalid.  And how was he gathering signatures?  By piggy-backing on petitions for an anti-immigrant law and the repeal of clean elections in Arizona.  Yeah, Ralph is really trying to build a progressive movement.  You can tell by the alliances with the corprorate funded, gay-bashing, anti-immigrant, opponants of clean elections.  Because what progressive doesn't agree with those values?  And finally, Governor Arnold wants to kill  urlLink kittens and puppies.   No, really.  That isn't a joke.  He wants to repeal the law that says the top priority for animal shelters is to find homes to adopt stray pets.  Arnold wants the top priority to be the swift murder of all the pretty kitties and puppies.  Did he miss a class in Politics 101?  Honestly, when does a politician come out on the pro- side of killing kittens.  Don't you learn that right after the whole kissing babies thing?

      So, I've been watching the  urlLink minor fuss  being made over Bill Clinton "losing it" in a BBC interview and "going off" on the interviewer.  All the initial reports made it out like Clinton completely lost his tempor and ranted at the BBC guy, but as more people see the interview, they are seeing that is really nothing.  He was justifiably upset at a really abusive one-note interview and while offering a empassioned rebuttal, he hardly lost his tempor.  I'm feeling a lot of kinship with William Jefferson over this, as I've seen people do that to me, too.  In the face of great abuse, if you have the gall to so much disagree, you get characterized as "bombastic" and this just becomes "conventional wisdom".  It doesn't matter that you were upset with cause and still remained on point in responding.  You showed "emotion" and that somehow gives your enemy ammo to use against you.  How, again?  How is exhibiting emotion a vice and not a virtue?  How is being passionate a reason for your allies to cut and run in the hopes of shielding themselves from attack.  They are doing it to Clinton now.  They did to Al Gore when he condemned the Iraq words in uncompramising but eloquent terms.  Its unfair, and we shouldn't fall for it.

      I've occassionally shilled for  urlLink [adult swim]  on Cartoon Network here, so I wanted to link to an article from Washington Monthly that is a great study of the programming block's history and significance.  Very good analysis about how good things happen when no one cares what you're doing.   urlLink Check it out.

      So, there is going to be a Christian version of  urlLink American Idol.   The latest of many Idol impersonators, the Christ Pop folks are predictably behind the curve on this one and jumping on a fad as its already outliving its usefullness.  But such is the way of contemporary Christian co-opting of pop culture.  Co-opting of cultures, of course, has a long history in Chrstianity.  The Catholic scholars I went to college with termed it "Putting New Wine in Old Bottles".  Basically, it was a way of winning converts by shortening the trip from pagan to believer.  So, it really shouldn't be a surprise that Christian's continue to immitate the work of the pagans in service of their faith.  Except, the motivation seems to have changed dramatically, and the result ain't as nice as Christmas.  I mean, who is getting converted by the awful pop music that's put out by the Christ Pop industry?  Come on, you've all heard the damn informercials late at night.  The music sucks, plain and simple.  A couple artists have found ways to incorporate faith into their music, but not the complete-lack-of-subtlety artists that are all the rage of full-blown Christ Pop.  I don't know a single Christian who enjoys "Christian" music, because frankly its just plain awful.  Clearly, a lot of people do enjoy it, though.  I have to suspect, however, that they do so not on the merits of the music (one hopes, anyway), but rather purely on the subject matter.  They consider all non-Christian music to be sinful or whatever.  They only want worshipful music.  Fine, whatever.  A lot of good worshipful music has been made over the years, though.  Gospel, hymnsongs, spirituals, the great masses, all really fantastic and enjoyable music.  Why not listen to that?  Because I suspect the real purpose of Christ Pop is retention, not conversion.  They fear pop-culture's pull, but instead of presenting a fundamentally different alternative, they just want to remake pop culture in Christ's image.  The think the young folks won't stick around unless they can play Pagan like all their friends.  The thing is, the folks who seem to like Christ Pop are pretty much the sort of people who would loathe anything not completely Christian.  So, why bother with the pseudo pagan Idolotry?  Its funny, because I actually really want to see the new movie  Saved , which at first glance looked like a Christ Pop kinda movie, but a second glance is clearly a more mature look at Christian youth culture, neither cheerleading or condemning them.  I'm especially encouraged to see Mandy Moore playing the stock character of the overt Christian who is more concerned with everyone knowing how Christian she is than actually being a good Christian.  Moore is very committed to her faith, but its good to see that she's not a blind bible-thumper, but that she can have a sense of humor about the subject, too.  I love her line-reading on the commercial quote "I am FILLED with Christ's love!"  Its clearly an over-the-top portrayal, but I can't say I don't know people just like that.  But, I suspect, more thin skinned Christian's will take issue with the film, just as they take issue with all things pop-culture until they figure out how to imitate it.

      Back before I was driven to give up on the Fat Acceptance movement, one thing I really wanted to push for was for a much increased advocacy role online in non-traditional forums.  Little did I know the the kind of "non-traditional" forums that interested the movement were those dedicated to the extreme hatred of fat people.  But instead of talking ourselves out of ourselves by engaging in "dialogue" a bunch of unapologetic hate-mongers, we really should be going after the people who genuinely don't know any better.  The people who, indeed, litterally don't know anything else at all except the fat=death pronouncements of the diet industry.  I've really been impressed with the political blogging community, and I think that with a small level of effort, fat acceptance could have greatly increased our visability.  Not by starting our own blogs, but rather by commenting when others bring up the topic of fat, making sure the fat acceptance perspective is heard.  This wouldn't necessarily just involve blogs.  It could involve all sorts of web forums where the subject came up.  Instead of relying on a single individual to offer the Fat Acceptance opinion, we could deploy a Fat Acceptance Action Team to flow in and start posting and backing each other up.  (back when I thought backing each other up actually happened in fat acceptance, mind you).  Ideally, these could involve people who are well versed in debating the skeptics or outright critics of fat acceptance.  Basically,  these volunteers would keep an eye out for the topic coming up and the send out an Action Notice of some variety to notify others of a needed activism opportunity.  Instead of just a single person expressing fat acceptance we could have 3 or even 4 making the case for it.  Part of the key would be to act present themselves independantly.  There wouldn't be any plotting how to respond jointly or trying to manipulate it so we looked like strangers.  We'd just each speak for ourselves and present our case.  This would be a far more productive manner to engage people with limited knowledge of fat acceptance than engaging people who DO know of fat acceptance but have already rejected it, often in highly inflamatory ways.  I just was never sure if there was enough motivation to get the right people on the job.  Last week, Big Fat Fraud posted links to several places discussing the awful fat-baiting documentary "Supersize Me".  One site he posted to, I had already known about and had already engaged the site's readers in the Comment section by bringing up the fat acceptance perspective.  It did seem odd that Paul was linking to a page where I had already posted to try to educate the owners and readers about fat acceptance.  Especially since no one else popped in to express it, either, when Paul posted the link.  I'm thinking of it again because the subject has again come up at this same  urlLink blog.   Its a great site, in general, but I'm discouraged at the blind acceptance of anti-fat, pro-diet propaganda.  Unfortunetly, that's something any fat activist just has to put up with.  It'd be nice to surround myself with fat acceptance supportive individuals.  But, that's a luxury very few people have.  Putting up with the weight-loss mindset is something every fat positive individual has to do every day of their life.  We have to accept it in our friends, family, co-workers.  If we are lucky, we can find a person to share our lives who also shares our beliefs, but generally, we just need to grin and bear it with diet promotion.  There is no other way to get by, really.

      "I never thought I'd be sitting next to an Iraqi president of a free country a year and a half ago." -George W. Bush  Really?  So as we were preparing to invade Iraq and overthrow its dictator, W. didn't think we'd actually win?  Really, what is that quote supposed to mean?  Yeah, I know its just self-congratularoty pap, but its also just plain stupid.  What did he think was going to happen when he invaded Iraq?  Had he thought about that?  Its not like he's sitting next to a democratically elected Iraqi president, where maybe he just meant he was unsure if we'd have a democratic government set up by now.  (not that being a democratically elected president is a big deal to W.)  This guy is just appointed.  What was Bush thinking about 18 months ago if not about the defeat of Sadaam Hussain?

      So, I saw some of those Girl Love Handles that got Dan Savage all bent out of shape a couple weeks back.  Or, at least, an example of the kind of "extreme" I'm sure Savage and other haters would use to illustrate a point when they are really talking about damn near any young woman in low-rise pants.  This girl was not so much wearing low rise shorts as she was wearing shorts that were noticably too small and had to be worn under her belly.  No doubt inspiring a new spiteful initialing like GPB (Girl pot belly).  But along with the belly were a pair of unmistakable love handles.  The girl was hardly fat.  A size 12 at most, but the outfit certainly emphasized what fat was there to the extreme.  A couple of thoughts.  First off, is that seriously what Savage and his ilk are so damned concerned about?  Honestly, how would this site so negatively effect your life just to have seen it?  It was so amazingly not worth caring about.  The other thought is that this girl's outfit is the kind of thing FA's get overly worked up about.  And no, not in the simple "ooooh, fat girl belly showing!" way.  I think its too easy to read too much into seeing one woman who is allowing her fat to be seen.  I know I've done it.  You can see why.  Tight shorts or not, this woman was reasonably well dressed.  It may not have been "high society", but it also wasn't anything explicitly "slutty" nor unkept.  Its also clear that she must have known the ramifications of the outfit and the display of her flesh when she put it on.  You see some women who are constantly tugging down on short shirts, but this wasn't a close call.  There was no way those shorts could have been worn anywhere but below her belly.  Surely this must be a sign of a greater acceptance of fat.  Surely this must foretell of a future where fat women feel the same freedom to choose their clothing as thin women.  Surely this conspicious display of fat is a good sign of something.  Except, it really probably isn't.  I want to think seeing a woman dressed like this means we are making some kind of progress (dubious, though it may be, I'm firmly in the camp that thinks fat women should feel free to wear whatever they damn well please and not be concerned with the kinds of negativism expressed by Dan Savage should any fat flesh be allowed into daylight)  But, the fact is, it doesn't really mean anything.  This isn't some great political statement.  Its probably not even a great personal statement of self-acceptance.  She probably just wants to dress like her thin friends and that desire is overriding any shame over her fat.  And just like I, as an FA, can read too much into such a sight, so do the critics of fat people.  They, oddly enough, jump to the same conclusions I find myself wanting to adopt, although with a very different spin.  To them, this is proof of the fall of civilization and all that.  Proof of a permissive attitude towards fat they are so certain must exist if there are so many of us fat people around.  While the FA may see this woman with unwarrented optimism, the fat basher sees this as justifying their own absurd fears.  Kind of a weird situation, really.  The sad fact is, I don't think we're making progress.  I saw the same sort of thing 10 years ago and had the same optimistic hope that this was proof of a growing acceptance of fat bodies.  But in the 10 years, I just haven't seen anything but an increasing backlash against fat people.

      I've been wanting to post for a few days on the Scott Peterson trial going on California.  No, not to revel in the horrible specticle.  But rather, to question why everyone assumes this man is guilty.  The way this story has gotten reported on, I'll admit I fell into that trap, too.  He had to be guilty, after all.  Everyone said so.  So it came as quite a shock when I saw reports about the trial discussing how tough it was for the Prosecution.  Really?  Because I hadn't heard anything about that before.  So I looked into it, and I was shocked at just how weak a case there is against Scott Peterson.  It rests entirely on the assumpsion that he acted kind guilty afterwards.  It'd be an insult to even call this a circumstantial case!  Yet this trial is going to last 6 months?  I realize that the less direct evidence you have, the longer a case will run, but just what is the evidence?   urlLink Suspicious coincidences  are not enough to convict someone.  The concern is, are they enough to inflame a jury when a defendant can't completely prove their innocence.  After all, Scott Peterson may have killed his wife.  I certainly see reason to suspect him, but I'm kinda stunned the case has gotten this far and that the media coverage has been so one-sided.  I can't even get past the motive.  Supposedly, Scott wanted to carry on an affair so he killed his wife.  Except, Scott's a bit of a dick and he's had affairs before.  And this time its with a woman who already has a family, so why would he be so eager to kill his wife and unborn child just to be with a woman who has a kid already and who he has only known for a month.  It doesn't make sense.  What's more, the police have been lying about their case.  They had long claimed that Peterson lied about a tv show that his wife was watching when he left her, insisting the show he described aired a day earlier.  I read this claim myself just a couple days ago.  Turns out, its completely untrue.  The show was on exactly when Peterson said it was on.  They've lied at other times, too, to try to turn Laci's family against him.  It all really upsets me because an uncle of mine was sent to prison in a high-profile case because the police, prosecutors, and judge all railroaded him.  I've seen these abuses up close.  I was maybe 5 when he was put on trial and it'd be a few years before his conviction got overturned and his case subsequently tossed out for lack of evidence.  (in brief, a confession from another man was suppressed by the police)  He may have been released, but it ruined his life.  It doesn't matter if the evidence isn't there or even if someone else confesses.  When you get brought up on horrible charges (in my uncle's case it was rape/kidnapping/murder of a young girl), it stays with you.  People assume you must be guilty.  He got himself killed while driving drunk a couple years latter.  I'm ashamed at myself for jumping to a conclusion about Scott Peterson's guilty, but I'm more ashamed at the Prosecution's haste to bring so weak a case.

      I see Big Fat Fraud has posted a link to an article by the scum bag who wished me dead.  [EDIT:  After I posted this, Paul disappeared the article from BFB, no doubt to spare himself the criticism for posting to a full-blown bigot]  In it, the author goes into his attacks on NAAFA's discussion boards, except he never really tells the truth.  You see, he was just a "skeptic" and just "asking questions" and his mea culpa is acknowledging that its wrong of him to ask questions in a fat acceptance space.  All proving he has learned nothing.  There is nothing wrong with asking questions about Fat Acceptance.  That's an opportunity to teach someone more about what fat acceptance is.  And yet, every single troll claims that this is all they were doing.  Maybe the first time they posted.  The problem is, they want to ask questions, they want to demand a defense of size acceptance, but unless the response is the fat activist repudiating fat acceptance, they aren't interested.  This troll's questions were answered, but he never showed any understanding of the answers.  He never showed any respect for our opinions.  He just kept demanding that we justify ourself to him.  And he still doesn't get why that was wrong.  He specifically reference me, but naturally in a manner which exaggerates my position and minimizes his abusiveness.  He claims in his article that I accused him of a hate crime.  This was meant to justify his response, even though he was kinda apologizing for it in the article.  Problem is, I never accused him of a hate crime.  After this individual specifically attacked me in a thread I hadn't commented on at NAAFA, I said this:  "And again, the trolls resort to making this about individuals who stand up to them. If anyone thinks standing up for size acceptance is on par with the disgusting personal attacks leveled by those who were banned from this board, then they have a serious problem. If anything, I'd say the moderators have been to leniant against the promoters of bigotry. To say that have been "unfair" to people who come here with a destructive agenda is a joke."  He acknowledges that he responded with an unprintable remark and claims he immediately back-peddled, but that's not true either.  Strictly speaking, he immediately amplified his attack and he only ever back peddled on a wide-ranging insult directed at all fat people.  And even while "back peddling" he was still blaming it all on me and offering yet another unprintable remark.  And this was all long before he wished me dead and started stalking my old blog for months acting like he was somehow my "buddy".  His article doesn't mention that, either.  I guess it'd be a lot tougher to play himself out as the "good guy" if it was revealed that over a month after he immediately back peddled that he was still wishing death upon someone who had the gall to disagree with him.  He certainly didn't immediately back peddle from his violent fantasies.  But he doesn't come clean about any of this in his article either.  From the praise being heaped on this bigot at NAAFA, you would think he'd have at least admitted he was wrong in all his petty and spiteful attacks on fat activists.  That wouldn't make it all better, but it'd at least be something.  But no.  He realizes that we were right to call him a bigot, and THAT IS IT.  That's a victory for fat acceptance?  Getting a bigot to admit he's a bigot?  I'm told that I should realize people should change, but what's the change?  The fact that he never says it his hate and bigotry was wrong is VERY noticable in its absence.  His lack of an apology essentially just affirms his hate's worth.  This is something fat acceptance should be happy with?  This is someone who is a valued contributor?  A bigot and hate monger who knows that we were right to call him a bigot and hate monger?  NAAFA's leadership should be ashamed of itself.  But, of course, the article's worst offense is that it lumped in an anti-fat hate group founded by one of the worst bigots around as part of fat acceptance.  The organization, who picked a name designed to be an insult towards fat acceptance, was founded by one of the Usenet trolls who destroyed Soc.Support.Fat-Acceptance and who spent months attacking NAAFA's site.  He joined up with a bunch of diet mongers who were bitter that NAAFA wouldn't abandon fat acceptance at their insistance.  Their site has often devolved into petty personal attacks against people in fat acceptance, including death threats/wishes against three fat activists.  And don't think I'm taking things personal because I was attacked there.  I was a pretty minor target.  The death wish directed at me was nothing compared to what was aimed at Jennifer Portnick, who was the subject of a damnation fantasy, or Marilyn Wann, who was hoped to "do the world a favor" and eat herself to death.  Wann, being far more high profile than myself, was the subject of the worst garbage.  Here are some examples.  And remember, NO ONE disagreed with any of this...  "shes a raving lunitic." "She was one of those bubble butt bimbo bikini brigade." "She is an left winged idiot." "Someone really should put a muzzle on that rockweiler before she bites an innocent victem." "Wann and her cronies have hyjacked the movement in order to sell merchandise and to promote a hate filled agenda of insanity. I feel that Wann is exploiting fat people for profit." "For me, there doesnt seem to be something only morally wrong with this, but legally as well." "she is about as nuts as they come" "Their agenda is to breed fear and to promote fat acceptance by that fear." "all she is out to do is have company in her miserable little world that she lives in" "An extreme liberal radical ideological rigidity beyond that of the most extremist groups." "They have launched smear campaigns on truth and reason at the expense of the health and well being of fat people in order to push their sick religion of fat." "I will be attending the next NAAFA convention and I am so embedded they won't suspect a thing. I will bring back so much evidence on this whore of a civil rights org that it will curl your hair." "The bottom line is NAAFA's lies are killing people." "they have contributed NOTHING to the Size Acceptance Movement." "Wann, Portnick, and Bodolay are known liars." "These radicals need some serious psycho analysis." "NAAFA is not in the civil rights business. They are in the brain washing business." "I am a person of peace, but I swear if I were standing infront of this lady, I would have to hit her over the head with the hardcover of her own book!!"  And the real kicker... "Personal attacks on Blickendorfer, Bodolay, Wann and Portnick are not being made here" "What is being said about Maryanne, Marilyn, Jennifer and Conrad are subsequently NOT personal attacks!" "I have recently read "Fat!So?" by Marilyn Wann and I am not attacking her personally" (he specifically called Wann delusional)  The kind of a discussion you'd find at a fat acceptance site?  I should hope not.  But NAAFA and BFB continue to validate this hate mongering.  The continue to placate their membership and chastize people who have the guts to stand up to it.  I keep hoping someone will restore my faith in fat acceptance, but as long as this level of hate is allowed under their "big tent", they are telling anyone who believes in fat acceptance to stay the hell out.

      So, I'm kinda pent-up with posts, so I'm going to throw a bunch out all at once.  I moved to a new apartment on Saturday and am still settling in.  Just got my computer up, but I still need to install something to get it online again.  I have less space then I'd probably like, but I think I can deal with it.  The fact is, my room is about the same size as my old room, and everything fit there.  Just a matter of getting everything out into its own space again, which just takes time.  Which, alas, I don't have.  I've been really busy with my part-time job at Target.  I've just got too many hours.  I don't think I'll be able to stay past early July.  Its just too rough on me.  I could do 15-20 hours a week, but not the 26-28 they have me working.  Especially not when I'm closing most of those days.  I'm closing three nights in a row this weekend.  I hate to leave it, but I have to make my full-time job my top priority.  If they can't adjust my hours, I'll probably be gone soon enough.  Anyway, I did have one story I wanted to relay in this post.  A friend of mine was helping me move into my new place and at one calm moment in all that, she remarked that I looked like I had lost weight in that cheery, congratulatory tone people use to say that.  I was pretty happy with my non "You're Welcome" response, basically just saying that I found it very unlikely that I had lost weight and not adding any value judgement to the concept of weight loss.  Funny thing is, she was right.  My new roommates own a scale, so I figured I'd check just to see, and I have lost like 15 pounds since December.  Which explains why my clothes have been fitting loosely.  Naive as I am, I was just annoyed that the clothes seem to have gotten stretched out and didn't fit the way I wanted anymore.  Frankly, annoynace is my greatest feeling with regards to losing weight.  I like my clothes.  I'm getting generally happy with my body.  I don't really want that getting messed up.  But, its not like I'm trying to manipulate it, so I should just take it in stride.

      Caught this from the AP, today:  urlLink Dieting Can Weaken Immunity   Short form: Dieting is very, very bad for you, but do it anyway.  How difficult is this for "obesity" researchers to understand?  If a treatment fails upwards of 95% of the time and the  treatment  has been shown to be dangerous and harmful all on its own, then you stop advocating that treatment.  You don't even need to get to the point of questioning whether being fat is so bad in the first place.  Dieting is harmful and ineffective.  Why is it still being pushed?  You'd never see this elsewhere in medicine.  Especially not over a disease as dubious as fatness.  ARGH!

      Ugh.  Can't Boston give me anything to write about?  I was all expecting to offer a local's perspectives on the horrific clashes between protesters and police, massive traffic back-ups, and the break-down of the mass transit system.  But, oh no!  None of that even happened.  Didn't they know some two-bit blogger wanted material?  Okay, kidding aside, I'm thrilled Boston went so smoothly.  Especially since it completely shows up the Boston Herald for all their fear mongering.  Not that they'll notice, but still.  So, in this final installment, read the story of secret trains that were found underneath the FleetCenter!  Read the story of the one sorta violent clash between protesters and police!  Marvel at how the Boston Herald *again* ignores the actual Convention in order to bash Democrats.  And, oh yeah, the Convention.  So, those  urlLink Secret Trains.   Word got out today that the subway authorities ran a special express train from the closed North Station underneath the FleetCenter on all days of the Convention.  The trains packed up and went directly to the BackBay station.  The idea was to get delegates and press out of the FleetCenter area as quickly and smoothly as possible.  Okay, fair enough.  But much like the Rider's rep quoted in the story, I have to wonder why the MBTA goes above and beyond for non-paying passangers and continues to provide subpar service to the Million-plus who ride their trains and buses every day.  At least I won't need to hear them scape-goating the DNC for their delays anymore.  Also, it looks like the Boston cops finally had a chance to do  urlLink a little bit of arresting on Thursday.   Seems a bunch of anarchists got into a shoving match with the police.  It was amusing to read one anarchists protests that they couldn't possibly have started it because why would they go after police in body armor.  Unfortunetly, I've met anarachists, so I know that's not really going to bother them.  These Bl(A)ck Tea folks set themselves up just to protest the convention.  It doesn't surprise me in the least that they'd try to provoke something.  It also doesn't surprise me that it wasn't much of anything.  3 people were arrested out of the clash, bringing the total of Convention related arrests to a whopping 4.  The other was some drunk guy ranting about Bush.  The front page of the Boston Herald proclaims that "Its Safe to Come Home".  An ironic title since the Herald's distribution is virtually exclusively Boston-based.  Basically, its continuing their  theme of how awful the Convention has been for Boston.  See, after they scared everyone out of town, it seems people didn't come into town.  But that's the Democrats fault.  They also put the minor protester clash mentioned above right on the front page.  They sorta mentioned John Kerry, but I suspect just to justify shilling for an article by the detestable Howie Carr where he ignores everything Kerry said and just re-writes it all to his liking.  Naturally, he gets in his  urlLink gigalo line.   I feel dirty even linking to that, but I figured I had to.  But moving in, I was happy to see all of Max Cleland's introduction and John Kerry's acceptance speech.  Great, great, great stuff.  I saw someone say that Cleland isn't a good speaker who veres between shyness and bombast.  Well, he had me fooled.  I think he went on a touch too long and tying in Boston's history seemed unnecessary, but really a great, great speech.  People are already faulting Kerry for not mentioning his anti-war work following Vietnam, but why did he need to?  Cleland already framed it so much better than Kerry could possibly do himself.  As for Kerry, he kept to his strengths and didn't try to be something he's not.  That's also been one of his greatest skills as a politician.  He knows who he is.  He knows what kind of a speaker he is.  He doesn't push himself to do what he's told will play well, but has faith in his ability to do what he does best.  No, its not the personable charm of a Bill Clinton or the easy persausiveness of John Edwards.  Rather, he speaks with conviction and strength of character, demonstrating insight over slogans.  I think he did an excellant job on all counts.  I loved that he brought up "Compassion in Action."  I loved his response to complaints about his nuanced views.  I love that they basically lowered expectations enough that him doing what he does well gets an even bigger response.  Its how Bush "won" the debates, after all.  I'm looking forward to the Democratic Party winning its 4th consecutive Presidential Election this Novemeber.  Kerry definetly has me excited about his prospects.

      "We are experiencing delays due to the Democratic National Convention."  I heard that about 5 times this morning as my train kept getting held up while we waited for trains in front of us to get searched.  It really annoyed me, though, because its completely untrue.  We're experiencing delays because the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority couldn't figure out that spacing out the trains by 5 more minutes would accomodate for the security checks and keep everything running smoothly.  Don't pass the buck, MBTA.  This is all your fault.  In other Boston life news outside of the Fleet Center... um, well, see here is the thing.  Nothing is happening.  No mass arrests of protests, no terrorists attacks, no extreme break-downs in the transportation grid.  Everything has been positively ordinary.  I'm sure things are helped because so many were scared off by doom and gloom projections by folks like the Boston Herald that they all stayed out of Dodge.  Which, naturally, gave the Herald more ammo to use against the DNC.  See, without all the business from the people who would be in Boston anyone but were scared off, it seems business is a little down around town.  Naturally, this was front page news.  Not the only news, though.  It had to share the front page with this other shocking story: John Kerry's daughter is nsidered attractive and may or may not have been hit on by Ben Affleck.  Because, you know, its not like anything IMPORTANT is going on in Boston right now that a local paper might want to mention on the front  page.  But, this is in keeping with their reporting all week.  Yesturday's big news was Obama.  It was Jesse Jackson bashing the city's race relations.  Well, actually, he had some soft criticism which he's since softened, but you could tell that from the big front page story.  The day before?  Theresa said some mean things about Ted Kennedy 30 years ago.  And Monday?  Theresa said some mean things to a reporter.  You know, they could at least try to be decent paper.  But no pretense here.  Its a Dem-bashing rag and wants no mistaking that.  They've fallen behind the city's free daily, the Metro, in journalistic respectibility.  Which is saying a lot since the Metro is basically a severely dumbed down version of the Weekly Reader for adults, USA Today.  I was happy to have a chance to see John Edwards speak live last night.  Great, great speech.  I always loved his Two Americas message and I was one of his voters in the Massachusetts Primary, and he really brought it all together, now focusing on building One America.  So perfect.  He hit all his points dead on.  All that trial lawyering clearly paid off.  He knows how to convince a crowd and to inspire compassion.  I felt his national security message was strong.  Loved that he not only worked in Kerry's Vietnam service but also his work on Senate Intelligence Committee.  He's hardly a foreign policy newbie, and that needs to be recognized.  I thought his message on Civil Rights was spot on, and it was great to see the crowd break into an "everywhere" chant, even if the lead-in was Straw-men-esque.  Strong close, of course, and he just looks like such a natural up there, especially with his family.  So, it all comes down to today.  Police are expecting trouble.  Seems like most of Boston is, too.  The streets were eeriely quiet this morning and I'm by no means near the Fleet Center, but still in a part of Boston that's very high traffic.  Lets just hope none of that trouble materializes.  I'm looking forward to another boring an uneventful day riding through the DNC.

      Well, it looks the Convention has finally found a way to be an annoyance on Boston commuters.  Actually, it is more a case of the Transit Authority finally finding a way to fufill the promise of Convention related annoyances.  After a day and a half of smooth commuting for the folks in Boston, the transit authority finally got the hang of turning it into a head-ache that frustrates riders.  The bag searches, admitedly a bit "Theater of Security" but I'll allow it, continue to be no big deal.  They take less time than it ordinarily takes to stop at the now closed North Station.  So how is this getting screwed up?  Naturally, by not adjusting the train schedule to accomidate for the slight delay that will happen at the station where the checks are being done.  Trying to run a normal schedule is just creating a vicious back-log of trains.  My train got stopped 6 times this morning for a total of 30 minutes waiting.  Had similiar problems last night, but they weren't quite as bad.  This all concerns me, because its making Boston residents resent the DNC, when really its just the ordinary incompetance of the public transportation authorities.  Yeah, I know the Blue Commonwealth is a safe as it gets, but it could also be home to a lot of energized Democrats working for the party and if those people get turned off, that could be lost.  And lets not forget that should Kerry win, the Blue Commonwealth will need to send a replacement to the Senate.  Good chance that it will be someone with a (D) next to their name, but I'd rather nothing happen to frustrate people with the DNC.  So, what else is going on around Boston.   urlLink I'm reading reports  that the city's famed "Duck Tours" are getting escorted by armed officers on Jet Ski's.  I have to admit, that sounds almost amusing to see.  I have to say, living in Boston, I'm not that bothered an of the security precautions.  Yeah, I've seen the roof-top cops.  Yeah, I've had my bag searched.  Yeah, there were a few too many motorcycle cops out at the anarchist march.  Yeah, a fence is apparently the greatest threat to free speech.  Color me unmoved.  I know its a lot of theater, but sometimes a show can be a deterrant.  I'm very pleased that things have gone so smoothly so far, and am cautiously optimistic that they will continue to go well.  So far, only one protest has been actually blocked, and that was an effort by anti-abortion groups to picket Kerry's private residence.  Frankly, a person's home shouldn't be a protest ground, so I don't mind that decision.  In other news, I had my first celebrity sighting.  No, not a celeb blogger like  urlLink Kos  or the unmasked  urlLink Atrios.   Rather, I saw  urlLink Alan Cumming  walking his dog near my office.  Now, when I tell this to people, I keep getting blank stares until I explain he was Nightcrawler in X-Men 2, at which point everyone gets very excited.  One co-worker was practically swooning when she realized who he was and chastized me for not bringing him back to her.  Because I have such powers.  It was pretty cool, though.  I like seeing famous people up close like that.  They always seem so ordinary and yet not.  Cumming was extraordinarily well dressed, very non-chalant.  I actually didn't see anyone stop him to pester him, which is good to see.  Not quite as cool as the time I nearly walked into Ted Kennedy, but I'll take it for my big sighting of the week.  Oh, and yeah, some Convention was going on, too.  Obama was freaking amazing.  But you already know that.  A future President, I've know doubt.  The only question is will it be Edwards/Obama in 2012, or Obama leading the ticket.

      This will begin my week-long saga of being in Boston and having nothing to do with the Convention.  Yes, some of us are here every day.  The closest I will get to the Fleet Center is riding underneath it twice a day.  So, the big story today is how little a story the commute was. &nbsp;The dire predictions (fueled in no small part to the "sky is falling" reporting from the Boston Herald) had everyone expecting a horrific commute. &nbsp;What we got was remarkably normal. &nbsp;Clearly, a lot of people are staying the heck out of dodge, but not a massive ammount. &nbsp;I'd say my train had somewhere between holiday commuting traffic and every day traffic. &nbsp;About what you'd expect for the period of the summer when many people are off on their vacations.   urlLink The Boston Globe  seems to back up my impression. &nbsp;Drivers found the experience rather underwhelming given the doom and gloom that was predicted. &nbsp;Again, light traffic helped a lot, and they hope to get it even better by convincing people to take mass transit since traffic is so light there. &nbsp;But, of course, that won't happen because the roads weren't a problem and people are still scared about what will happen with the much threatened bag searches.  This was my big worry going into the week. &nbsp;The transit authority originally planned on bottlenecking the entrances to all stations that would eventually pass under the Fleet Center and searching random bags. &nbsp;This seemed like a nuisance, but an understandable one. &nbsp;When the ACLU and the like complained, the transit cops stepped up the threat to searching ALL bags just to be fair. &nbsp;Now this, I dreaded. &nbsp;The thought of waiting in a long line just to get into the station seemed dreadful. &nbsp;Especially since they seem to want to do this from now on, even after the DNC. &nbsp;Thankfully, the seriously modified the search all bags plan and came up with something entirely sensible. &nbsp;Instead of searching everyone at the stations entrances throughout the system, they are stopping the train one stop before it rides underneath the Fleet Center. &nbsp;Transit cops (who are looking quite scary, by the way) then board the train and walk through the cars checking all of bags. &nbsp;Its smooth, sensible, and not at all a problem. &nbsp;They also only did this while the Convention was in progress, also sensible. &nbsp;A huge hassle became a point of good planning. &nbsp;Horray.  In other news, there is much complaining going about the "Free Speech Zone". &nbsp;Okay, yes, it is unfortunetly named, but it isn't near the oppressive, Orwellian structure some suggest. &nbsp;It seems to have become fashionable to label the demonstration zone at the Fleet Center a "cage", such as these  urlLink anti-abortion activists.  &nbsp;I'm normally sympathetic to complaints about "free speech zones", but that's usually because they are designed to move free speech as far away as possible. &nbsp;That's just not the case here in Boston. &nbsp;I've been out to the Fleet Center. &nbsp;The protest zone is right out in front of the Fleet Center. &nbsp;You can't get any closer. &nbsp;Its also right next to the delegate parking lot, as evidenced  urlLink here.  &nbsp;And the fence is quite necessary given the busy traffic in the area and the fact that to ensure the protesters a spot next to the FleetCenter, the set up an area on a Construction site underneath a soon-to-be-dismantled elevated rail. &nbsp;(Boston's last, I believe). &nbsp;I know its trite, but someone could get hurt. &nbsp;Last I checked, a small bit of fence has never silenced our civil liberties. &nbsp;And just look at these creatively dressed  urlLink protesters.  And just look at that blue sky above them. &nbsp;Yeah, that's quite the picture of a cage. &nbsp;And, of course,  urlLink protests continue throughout Boston.  &nbsp;Gotta love the marching anarchists.  As to the Convention itself, it seems that inspite of the fretting that Kerry was going soft, we learned his real plan. &nbsp;Lay out the attack on Bush from the big guns, getting it out of the way, and then turn around and present your positive message from everyone else. &nbsp;It makes perfect sense. &nbsp;Jimmy Carter critizing Bush carries much more gravitas than Howard Dean doing so. &nbsp;It doesn't look as much like politics when its the elder statesment of the party laying out the case against Bush. &nbsp;And this frees Kerry to lay out the case for himself in the next 3 days. &nbsp;The spin is key, though. &nbsp;The speeches made the case against Bush, but seemed largely about making the case for Kerry. &nbsp;That's clearly not the early spin, though, but it may be just as well to get that out of the way now. &nbsp;What's more, this gets all the Clinton talk out of the way in one day. &nbsp;Gosh knows the press loves to speculate about the Clintons. &nbsp;Now its out of their system, and we can be on to bigger and better things. &nbsp;Count me as impressed with the plan.

      When I was in college, I always got to stick around for the week after final exams leading up to the Graduation Ceremonies and their Alumni Reunion Weekend.  I always loved this because I got to see the changes the school underwent for the benefit of the parents and alumni.  All of a sudden the ordinary campus became bedazzled with flowers jammed into every possible nook.  One lawn even sprouted flowers in the form of our school's sports logo.  The grass became greener, either by rolling our new grass or using some seeding process that looked like they were spray painting the ground green.  It always reminded me of those RonCo "Hair in Can" bald spot cures.  Everything got a fresh coat of paint and an extra scrub to benefit the folks who didn't spend any time here and while all the people who do spend time there were gone.  And so it goes in Boston for the DNC.  Its really a marvel what is being done to the city.  It all seems like little things at first, but it adds up.  My train station will be handling overflow from the displaced Commuter Rail lines, so I guess it qualified for a fresh coat of paint.  For a week, the station has been plastered with "Wet Paint" signs as everything gets a nice glossy finish.  I've started noticing little directional signs all around Boston proper, too.  Nothing Convention specific, all feeling like it could have always been here.  Well, maybe the flowers stand out.  Man, are there flowers.  I walked down by Newbury Street and Mass Ave and was stunned by all of the flowers that have shown up down by the Hynes Convention Center.  The road divider is not this massive flower laden trough.  Every lamp post has been adorned with pots exploding with flowers.  My office has had the pleasure of jackhammers just outside our walls as they actually are replacing a significant bit of a road in the Back Bay.  I almost think they painted the remaining Central Artery that they weren't able to pull down in time, but I think I may have imagined that.  It all feels like the municipal equivalent of getting gussied up for a big date but going a bit far.  And, of course, the last people to appreciate any of this are the people who live and work here.  Oh, I'll be coming into town, but it does seem like I will be in the minority.  Of course, even I will be making sacrifices.  I'll be buying lunch for a week to avoid the transit bag checks that promise to make life even harder for Bostonians.  But I still think they are making a mountain out of a molehill.  Well, maybe making Mt. Everest out of a more modest sized mountain with some nice ski slopes.  But I do hope our visitors appreciate the lengths we've gone to in order to look pretty.  Enjoy the flowers

      After a week spent loving the 90's, I want to make a couple observations...  Someone at VH1  LOVES  R.E.M.  I think they showed up in the soundtrack to  I Love the 90's  over once an episode.  Being a big R.E.M. fan, I noticed each time it happened, so trust me, it happened way more than would have been understandable.  Especially since they didn't even mention R.E.M. at all in the series.  (I suspect "Everybody Hurts" will be featured in the sequel series,  I Love the 90's: Part Deux)   Susan Powter is freaking insane.  You may recall her as the diet guru behind "Stop the Insanity".  An ironic self-slogan if ever there was one.  She was not a frequent commentator, but when she showed up with her George Clinton hair-do screaming at the camera, its tough to appreciate her supposed sanity.  I really miss Stewart Scott and Rich Eisen on Sportscenter.  I know purists will insist Olberman and Patrick are the definitive ESPN pair, but give me Eisen and Scott any day.  I hardly watch at all now that Eisen is gone.  Hal Sparks is money waiting to happen.  His comic timing and sensibilities are just so dead-on.  He is so wasted on  Queer as Folk  just because he should be staring in his own sitcom already.  As expected, nostaliga about 5 years ago rang a bit hallow.  But at least they addressed that in the show and made fun of the fact that they were doing this at all.  VH1 has perfected the art of instant nostalgia, though, so they made even 1999 enjoyable and yet so far away.  I did like the early computer graphics motif as the visual look of the series.  I was wondering what would be the signature 90's look, and that pretty much sums it up.  Good call.  Oh, and I was loving the orange.  I don't think Michael Bolton gets that he's a joke.  Not nearly as cool as Lionel Ritchie was doing the little out of commercials bits in prior "I Love the..." series.  I also don't think MC Hammer quite knows how to deal with being a joke, but man was he high-energy.  I'm not sure how much "caffine" he pumped into his system to get up for doing his little bits, but someone needs to give that man some sleeping pills or something to try to slow him down.  I guess the energy videos were just him being normal.  Who knew?  And finally props to  The Daily Show  alumni who all did excellant work, as always.  Its amazing what a little pop-cultrue commentary factory TDS has become, but kudos to them all.

      Old Navy, also known as the company responsible for 99% of my wardrobe, has debuted their new  urlLink plus-size line  at their web store.&nbsp; Some Boutiques are already open in their brick &amp; morter stores and they have a helpful zip code finder to locate the nearest such outlet.&nbsp; Given that 2 of the 50 are near me, though, I'm guessing its still a bit limited.  &nbsp;  But still, the online store is a start.&nbsp; They seem to be putting a lot of care into, too.&nbsp; Reading their sizing information, it seems that the "home base" for their plus-size clothes is a size 20.&nbsp; That means that they adjust down from a 20 to get a 16 and up from a 20 to get a 26.&nbsp; Ordinary women's clothing uses a size 8 as "home base" and can expand right out to a size 20.&nbsp; This means an Old Navy Women's Plus&nbsp;size 20 is a much better fit than an Old Navy Women's size 20.&nbsp; No reference on how this compares to other plus-size clothing lines, though.&nbsp; But it does mean that their plus-size clothes will be a lot roomier and more carefully fitted than they have been.&nbsp; Not to mention that they are now available for women right up to a size 26.  &nbsp;  The attitude is what is really selling me, though.&nbsp; Here is a quote from an interview with one of the "fit models" from the line:  &nbsp;  "I&nbsp;don't want to hide my curves. I like my curves!"  &nbsp;  Damn good to hear!&nbsp; Also, the models used (which aren't that many, admitedly) are actually fat.&nbsp; I mean, they aren't pushing the envelope, just yet, and using size 26's, but the women are visably fat.&nbsp; They have bellies, they have chubby upper-arms, they have double chins.&nbsp; They aren't running from being identified with fat the way the big modeling agencies do when they hire the thinnest fat women possible with very tall women who barely fit into a size 12 and have nothing on their body that could be seen as fat.&nbsp; I know its a small step, and a lot of people are still excluded, but its a lot bigger step then I was expecting and the backing of Old Navy could seriously change the Plus-Size clothing market for the better.&nbsp; Simply put, Lane Bryant is going to have to deal with competition.  &nbsp;  Maybe soon, we can get someone to expand their sizing past 32.&nbsp; (which is the upper limit at The Avenue, and I think the high-water mark for&nbsp;specialty retail stores)&nbsp; This is a step in that direction, that is certain.  &nbsp;  Oh, and while looking for info on this topic, I discovered&nbsp; urlLink Girly Blog  a great resource for plus-size clothing and related issues.&nbsp; Worth&nbsp;a look.

      I wanted to post a link to video from an amazing segment from Jon Stewart on yesturday's  The Daily Show  where he illustrated the ways Republicans use "talking points" to defame John Kerry and John Edwards.&nbsp; A very brilliant segment yet so simple.&nbsp; He just showed repeated clips of GOP spokespeople using the same exact language to attack Kerry and Edwards without ever backing it up.  &nbsp;  But, alas, they don't have it on their site yet.&nbsp; So, instead, I will link to his  urlLink reporting on the gay marriage issue,  which was also top notch and touched on one of the funniest stories to come out of that.&nbsp; Namely, the analogy one Republican made between gay marriage and marriages between men and box turtles.  &nbsp;  Yes, box turtles.&nbsp; Jon has the story so I won't repeat it, but suffice to say the "Universal Symbol" he uses to represent man/box turtle relations is hilarious and needs to be a T-Shirt.&nbsp; The Box Turtle, by the way, has very quickly been adopted as the mascot of the Gay Marriage movement.&nbsp; Because its just such a hilarious analogy.&nbsp; Way&nbsp;funnier than Senator Rick Santorum's obsession with man on dog sex.

      I don't think I've told my hippie story here, yet.  Back in late May, I was walking down the street in front of my apartment when a pack of little punk suburban kids start coming down the other way.  Now, growing up in an inner city environment, I am accutely aware that groups of black teenagers are nothing to worry about.  Its the white ones that scare me.  So I tried to casually keep my distance, not my eye contact, etc.  Seems I caught there eye, however.  While trying to ignore them, it eventually occured to me that they were making fun of me.  Because I'm fat? Nope.  Because I wear glasses? Nope.  Because I was there? Nope.  Because I was a hippie.  Suffice to say, I found this confusing.  The mocking eventually escaleted to one of the girls in the pack throwing coins at me.  (they missed by a mile)  As they went on, I tried to process what happened.  For one, I was suprised anyone bothers to hate hippies anymore.  I mean, are they even a relevent enough subculture to hate anymore?  Why on earth are a bunch of poser teens obsessed with hippies enough to mock someone they consider to be one and throw things at him.  Next thing I wondered was, since when am I hippie?  I always thought my look was half-way between Hipster and Hippie, never really pulling off either.  Too well-maintained to be hippie, but too casual to make hipster.  At the time I was wearing boot-cut jeans, my orange Chuck Taylor's, an off-white linen shirt, and a tan courderoy jacket.  When I describe this, people always blame the jacket.  I can understand this, except its a very slight courderoy.  I mean, its from Old Navy, not a vintage store.  Now, sure, I have one button on the jacket, which can be a hippie thing, but its only one.  Its not like its lined with buttons.  And gosh its just an "I (heart) NY" button.  I've worn it since 9/11.  I bought it at the WTC when I visited it in 1989.  Hardly hippie cred.  I had a goatee at the time, too.  More of a wanna-be Van Dyke actually.  Hippie is more outright unshaven though.  Clean facial hair is more on the hipster side of things.  Except mine never looks very slick, so again it falls in between.  Suffice to say, I didn't get the knee-jerk declaration that I was a hippie.  Not that I have a problem with hippies.  I've known quite a lot in my time, and I don't think any of them would have really thought of me as a fellow hippie.  My last thought was that the only other time I'd heard of someone having money thrown at them out of spite was a Jewish friend who was harrassed in high school with anti-semetic slurs by some jackass at our school.  And then the whole incident seemed a lot more meaningless.  Just wanted to share.

      I have today off, but I actually got myself up early just so I could see John Kerry's annoucement of his running mate, which as soon as I got up was already known to be John Edwards.  Got to say, I'm very pleased.  As some of my readers know, I backed Edwards in the primaries partly because I thought he'd be a good VP candidate.  More recently, there has been such a groundswell of support for John Edwards, its been overwhelming.  Kerry listened to the people on this one, and that is a great issue to raise.  This also allows him to approrpiate Edwards' Two Americas message pretty much directly, which is a great way of condensing the Democratic message.  There are a lot of complaints that no one knows what Kerry stands for, but he's well on his way towards communicating his message and vision and I'm looking forward to it.  Only problem is that Will Forte has been doing Bush and Edwards on SNL.  Well, I'm sure they can balance that easily enough. And frankly, the more they give Will Forte to do, the better.

      Someone responded to my last post in my comments by suggesting I'd meet more women if I lost weight.  Yeah, I'm not sure they read the post either.  Amusing and sad all at once.

      Man, I really feel like a whiney bitch lately.  Doesn't help that I've felt like I've been getting sick for a week now.  Never actually sick, just like I'm coming down with something that never seems to come but keeps me feeling pretty awful.  So, in the spirit of this mood, I'll not be talking about politics or pop culture or anything of significance or interest.  I'm just going to be whining about how much I suck.  Just warning you now.  I'm just feeling really freaking lonely lately.  I've been single for over 5 months now, which is pretty long for me.  I've been largely okay with it, unmotivated to really look for someone, but that's all crashing down now.  I'm really missing being with someone.  Its not about sex. Its the closeness, the intimacy.  Sharing my bed with someone.  Holding them close to me.  The feeling you get when the person you're with just looks at you.  Its about providing someone with emotional support and being supported by them.  I'm missing it all right now and its really bumming me out.  The way I see it, there are three things that go into a relationship.  Intellectual stimulation, emotional stimulation, and physical stimulation.  I'm not sure its fair to say any of the three is the most important, and I'm also  young enough to still feel that I can look for and find all three, but its hard not to be pessimistic sometimes.  It seems like it should be easier, but I guess it never is.  With my last girlfriend, I was very physically stimulated and very intellectuall stimulated, but there was never an emotional stimulation.  Never that spark of something more.  I liked her.  I liked spending time with her, but that's not love.  I think part of that is because I held back something important to me because I was afraid of being rejected for it.  What I was holding back was my passionate belief in fat acceptance.  I knew it was something I needed to be able to share with someone to really feel a connection, but I was coming out of a relationship where I was rejected for it and it scared me.  I think I'm only know getting over that rejection.  It wasn't even like I was dumped for believing in fat acceptance.  No, my girlfriend decided she didn't believe in it anymore, but knowing how important it was to me, she lied to me about what she was doing.  She went on a radical, starvation-style diet, ramped up her excercise dangerously, and was never honest about any of it.  She knew I couldn't support it, she knew it went against what I believed.  She knew because I told her.  Not as a warning, but out of appreciation.  I had never knew what it was like to be with some who felt the same way as I did about these things, and it made so amazingly happy.  I wanted her to know how happy it made me feel.  I wanted her to know how much appreciated her and being with her.  It wasn't to try to order her around.  It was to thank her.  The common complaint when someone objects to dieting in a partner is that its their life and their body and I can't make their decisions.  But, isn't this my life?  Can't I make decisions about my life?  I cannot support dieting.  I know that is built on a foundation of lies and misinformation.  I know that it won't work.  Maybe for some FAs, its just about the fat body, but thats not it at all for me.  If it was, I'd just sit back and wait for the diet to fail.  Odds are 19 to 20 that the diet will fail, if even that.  Odds are also 9 out of 10 that the diet will result in her being fatter than she started.  If it was just about the body, I'd just sit back and wait it out.  That's not what it is about.  Its about sharing my life with someone and knowing that on the things that are really important to me, we feel the same way.  Its about not being asked to support something I know is a mistake.  I regret not getting the chance to talk my exgirlfriend out of what she was doing to herself, but I'm also upset that I wasn't able to make a decision for my own life.  I'm upset at how depressed I was over it and how self-doubting I became.  I'm upset at how I hid this from my last girlfriend, not letting her in and something I feel so passionate about.  Not being able to share that.  I'm upset that some of the fear remains.  Maybe if not in the form of being afraid to be honest, but being afraid that I'll never find someone to share this with.  Or being afraid that even if I do, I may not be able to trust it.  Or that I will be able to trust it, but I'll be lied to again.  And there just aren't any easy answers about this.  Its not like I need to be with a gung-ho activist.  I'll be happy with someone who has decided that dieting is wrong and who is trying to learn to accept herself as a fat woman.  Acceptance is always a journey.  I know that in my own life.  Its never easy, its never perfect, but you keep working towards the goal and that's what is important.  When I broke up with my last girlfriend, I started putting up personals ads and I kinda mentioned fat acceptance but always in very coy ways.  It was clear people didn't get what I meant.  Now, I'm very upfront.  I mention fat acceptance directly, even discuss it a bit and how important it it is to me.  It should be clear what I mean, but I still get responses from people who just don't care.  I got one yesturday from someone who was pre-op WLS.  Not she came out and said this, I just recognized her screen-name as someone who had agressively backed WLS at a BBW forum in the "how dare you disagree with me" vein.  It just makes me sad.  I know its wrong and I can't just make it go away by saying that I'm sure this girl will beat the odds and it will all be wonderful.  A few "success" stories can't make me ignore the truth of it and the truth of the pain that the weight loss culture causes.  It just makes me sad.  And yesturday, it made me annoyed that they didn't come out and say this.  They acknowledge that I mentioned fat acceptance and responded using language that I wouldn't disagree with unless I knew what they really meant by it.  I just felt like I was being lied to again and it made me angry.  I fired off a brief email chastizing them for not being upfront in their response since I was upfront in my ad.  I probably should have just ignored it, but I felt like I needed to do something to reclaim my right to feel this way.  My right to my beliefs.  But, I don't know if I can hope to find someone who will agree with me about this.  Its tough and its discouraging.  It seems like the only people I ever find who seem to have the "total package" live far away are are otherwise involved.  Putting up personals at a local site is an iffy proposition.  Even the good responses might not really get what I was saying.  The BBW dances in this area just depress me most of the time.  They seem like a great big diet support groups sometimes.  A WLS support group at its worst times.  Thats not an environment where I feel accepted as an FA.  I don't even get why these women want to be with an FA.  I know a lot of FAs are very wishy-washy in their commitment to being an FA and utterly ignorant about fat acceptance, so I guess that makes it easy to assume that being FA just means being attracted to a woman during the time she's losing weight and after that it doesn't matter.  Why do you want someone to think fat women are sexy when you are getting WLS?  Just in case it fails?  Because you don't respect our feelings at all?  Because you assume we must not really mean it?  Years ago, the BBW dance scene seemed to go hand-in hand with the activism side of things, but that's been lost.  I know a lot of activists knock the dances as trivial, but I think it could really be a useful way to reach out and educate people about the movement.  I think this used to happen with no effort.  The environment alone did it.  That's changed, though, and I don't think any real education is going on.  I don't think any outreach is happening.  I think now it'd be tough to introduce any since there is such institutionalized hostility towards fat acceptance at the dances.  Its a real missed opportunity, I think.  How do I find someone to be myself with?  To share myself with?  To just hold close to me and enjoy doing absolutely nothing?  Is it really too much to ask for?  And that's a rhetorical question.  I once asked that at a fat positive forum and got the utterly depressing response from many people that "Yes, it is too much to ask for.  Just give up."  I don't want to give up, though.  I know how happy it can make me feel to be with someone I could share this with.  I know how wonderful all that quiet intimacy can be.  I know its what I want and what I need.  I just wish it was what I had, because I right know I just feel mopey and alone.

      Well, today is the 1 year anniversary/birthday of my blog.  It all started with my first posts on August 10, 2003 as I sat around my apartment on a lazy Sunday afternoon and was  urlLink ceremonously interrupted by a parade marching down my little side-street.   Of course back then the name of my blog was obligatory title, which still exists out in cyber space for any of my old-school fans.  All of the posts have been transferred over here, though, so don't feel like you are missing out.  Ah, those young and innocent days when all of my titles were uncapitalized for self-conscious effect and when I wasn't getting troll attacks on a semi-daily basis.  I've been reading back through my archives in advance of my Blog Birthday.  I've been struck by a few things.  First off, I'm a really awful speller.  I mean, I knew that, but even I'm blown away by how bad I get.  Blogger really needs to add a spell check to save the world from my pitiful attempts and spelling.  I always was surprised how frequently I used to post and how well I did concentrating on the pop culture commentary and poliblogging.  I've kind of let both things flounder as I've allowed myself to wallow and seethe here on occassion.  My apologies.  I'll try to be better.  Overall, I meant my blogging to reinvigorate my writing sensibilities.  I think it did that at times, but its also exposed a lot of my flaws as a writer.  It has kept me more actively thinking about writing and I have been scribbling notes for a script to a few graphic novels I intend to write one of these days.  But I never seem to have the time to get as much work done on them as I'd like.  Its also drawn me into the political blogging community, and I obviously have become quite taken with it.  Also just a little bit jealous that these folks have the time and talent I lack to post so aggressively about progressive causes.  I've gone back and forth on my favorites.  I always love  urlLink Atrios  and  urlLink Pandagon.   I don't read  urlLink Talking Points Memo  and  urlLink Political Animal  nearly as much as I should.  I've become positively addicted to  urlLink Daily Kos  in the last month and have occassionally contributed diary entries there.  Over all, I don't think its been as good as I want it to be, but its had some good moments.  I'm a harsh critic of myself, but a fair one, I think.  I hope in the next year, I can manage to be at least a little bit better for both of my readers.

      North Korea has gotten a hold of  urlLink weapons systems  that would allow them to stage a nuclear attack on the United States.  How the hell did that happen?  Because the publisher of the hyper-Conservative Washington Times  urlLink GAVE IT TO THEM.   I could on about the faults of Unification "Church" founder Rev. Moon's faults.  There are so many.  The man George H.W. Bush has called a  urlLink "Man of Vision"  has called for  urlLink Genocide  against gays.  He has been repeatedly recognized by the Bush administration and even got $450,000 from the government to teach  urlLink faith-based sex education.   Because I know I want my kids taught sex-ed from someone who wants all gays killed and who suggests people being raped should  commit suicide.  Regretably, Democrats and Republicans both have given the rub to Rev. Moon, such as the bipartisan  urlLink Coronation  (yes, Coronation) at the Senate office building earlier this year. Lets just say,  urlLink there is a LOT  wrong about Rev. Moon.  But I'm guessing supplying a sworn enemy of the United States with the technology to stage a nuclear attack on the US is going to push to front of the line of his faults.  And still, we have no interest in confronting North Korea, a dictatorship we KNOW has WMDs, the technology to use them against us, and the desire to do so.  Gotta love that Bush doctrine.
