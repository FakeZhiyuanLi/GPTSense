       I found the quote "Death is more universal than life; everyone dies, but not everyone lives". This is true. Thinking about death is not being pessimistic. Death is a part of our lives (verbal irony...haha). It meets us in the beginning, middle, or end. But once again, we find death cannot exist without life. Life comes first, and Death comes later. Does this mean life is of more importance? More powerful? Does it mean Life = Good, Death = Evil? We have been conditioned to think so. Conditioned, or born with those ideals? Is it something automatically programmed into our brains before we are born? Or is it something we are taught to think by ourselves? Then again, some are born dead. Death inflirtrates a woman's womb. Everything is balanced for a reason but what reason? Death vs. Life, Rich vs. Poor, Good vs. Evil, Heaven vs. Hell. None can exist without it's counterpart, because without the counterpart we wouldn't have much diversity in our opinions, now would we? We would have no right or wrong. It's a cycle. The simplest of things are the hardest to understand. So simple that it enables us to create twisted versions of it and accept it for the truth when the original concept has all the answers.   Yes, that was really random....haha....   DEATH is stronger than all the governments because the governments are men and men die and then death laughs: Now you see ’em, now you don’t.   DEATH is stronger than all proud men and so death snips proud men on the nose, throws a pair of dice and says: Read ’em and weep.   DEATH sends a radiogram every day: When I want you I’ll drop in—and then one day he comes with a master-key and lets himself in and says: We’ll go now.   DEATH is a nurse mother with big arms: ’Twon’t hurt you at all; it’s your time now; you just need a long sleep, child; what have you had anyhow better than sleep?

       Well nothing happened today, I'm not surprised. I feel useless, my mother is constantly bitching at me so I get frustrated and i'm like "fuck it".      It's so hard to not make my life sound like the one of another stupid teenager with depression. What I have isn't teen angst or  "oh god i hate the fucking world and i want to rip everyone's flesh into tiny little shreads and see them bleed as i tear them apart and hear them scream as i rip out their heart and hang them from the ceiling by their intestines."  No, I don't think like that. Nor do I want to grab a knife and slash my wrists so that I can carry out some fucked up suicide attempt and have people feeling sorry for me.      Everything is so stereotypical these days.  There are smaller margins on what it is to be original.  People classify you no matter what you do.       1. Oh you dress in all black and have a pasty ass complexion, you must be a "Goth!" or...    2. wow, you have different color shoes, checkered pants, a shirt that doesn't match, and funky ass hair you must be a "punk!"...     3. then the classic (and yes, i hate it) khakis, with flip flops, a tight ass Abercrombie & Fitch shirt, with one of those surfer necklaces and spiky hair....oh no you're a "prep!"        (but then again, everywhere i go i see these guys dressed like that with some blond girl at their side dressed in the female version of this so called "fashion". so i don't see it as original whatsoever. Paying $60 for some of those clothes Abercrombie sells, is seriously a crime)        You get labelled for trying to be original to some extent.      Some, well no,  most people think the Gothic culture is a "music culture" . They think they are these weird satanical people that have an obession with death and will murder you if you get in their way. Personally, I haven't really gotten around to asking them why they dress that way but the basic overview is that it's not a music culture.   Back in the day people didn't have dyes for clothes so everyone had black or grey clothing. Goth is a type of architecture. The Visigoths existed in Germany. There are so many things that Goth pertains to, yet  we don't know anything below what we see.      Sure, most of them are what we call "posers" who try to stand out by giving you muderous looks so that you'll leave them alone and be intimidated by them.      Then we typically  associate punks with the self mutilators  that go around with short sleeves so they can show the world their self inflicted wounds. Once again, most of the people I see at my school like that have kitten scratch "wounds". If you fucking wanted to kill yourself go slit your wrists nice and deep and don't show anyone!!  Why else would you go around showing everyone things like that? Oh,  I'm depressed and be afraid of me because i'm not afraid to carve out my veins!  Hmm....all I have to say is REAL PUNK IS DEAD. I don't blame them for wanting to dress like that BUT when it's obvious you are doing it for show more than hardcore addiction, watch out, you could get bashed!!!  (sense the sarcasm in that people)     On my part, that's a criticism, but don't blame me. I write what I see.     We purposely try to be someone we aren't to get a form of respect and fear. Power.     We also fear what we don't understand.  (damn that sounds so cliché but it's true) Get to know some of these people and see what they are really like.  In school I hear the "preps" making fun of the "goths and punks" because they're "freaks" and they are "gay". I know none of them have ever gotten to know each other but we make assumptions on what somebody is like simply because of what we label them as. Every category has a default personality description and we think that's all we need to know.      Prep = bitchy, rich, white, ditzy, disrespectful, racist    Goth = depressed, weird, stupid, death obsessed, love black clothing, satan worshippers    Punk = freaks, stupid, posers, none of their clothes match     We automatically think these things, but once we get to know them, they are very different.   But in a society where we are force fed ideologies on these things, we discriminate.         I constantly think about things like that. Once you get to know me you'll be surprised at what goes on in my head. That is probably one of the reasons why I don't talk about these types of things with people my age. Most don't understand. Most of them are concerned with trivial things.    We waste our time debating over what brand of toilet paper to buy, what toothpaste to use, what brand of tissue paper we need to clean our snot with  (and it's not like the bugs in the trash can are like "Dude! this is Puffs! not shitty Kleenex!!").   Capitalism!!!!    Don't ask how this all stemmed from talking about my boring old day. I'll continue some other day....now  a thought on DEATH.                   M  EN   fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other. Certainly, the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin and passage to another world, is holy and religious; but the fear of it,   as a tribute due unto nature, is weak.

       Hello lovely people......    How are you all on this perfectly desolate but glorious morning/afternoon/evening?    I cut myself, so now i'm trying to stop my hand from bleeding so err...profusely. When blood mixes with water it looks like Kool-Aid....haha, movie blood! Hmm...yeah, blood is interesting to study. No, not just because of my semi-obsession with vampires (b00!), and no not because my favorite color is red. *evil smile*     Well, since i woke up about an hour ago, there haven't been sufficient "events" to write an entry about my day so far.    This summer has been really strange. It rains for days at a time, then we get one sunny day, and then it's cold for days after that. This is something i wrote about the seasons. Each stanza is a different season (not that hard to figure out). Stanzas 2 and 4 are only written using words to express what you smell or hear. Have fun.....i'll write more later on.

       Well i've been busy with band practice for the past two days. We have a new marching style this year and it's a hard bitch to learn. I'm kinda excited for band camp actually, the music isn't as bad as i thought it would be. It's a circus jazz style, very cool. I hope the n00bs don't fuck it up, they aren't bad but the drumline isn't half as good as it was last year. Dan and Jarell are going on a European tour for Student Ambassadors. I got invited last year but for certain reasons that cannot be named here, I had to turn it down. =(     I'm not too thrilled about band practices (the bugs are one of the reasons), I don't have a lot of friends there, I just noticed that. Jen left for Grandville, and Toni moved back to Philadelphia, and now she's moving to Vancouver, Washington. =( People show such indifference towards me. I have been friends with some of them since I was 11 and then they just walk by me without even saying "hi" or "how have you been?".     I could tell you about each of them, what they do, what they are like, etc. That's why sometimes I'm so quiet, I analyze people without ever talking to them. I see their actions, their reactions, their choices, how they choose their words, how they choose their friends. It's amazing how much you can learn from being an outsider.     I considered quitting the band at some point because to me, the music is just as important as the people you play it with. You don't play as an individual, you play as one, one sound -- one heart. When you know the person sitting next to you despises you, it's hard to enjoy the music and give it everything you have. I don't think I have ever given anyone a reason to dislike me, but it happens. I hate it, because I consider those people my friends yet to them, I'm an enemy. Then again I have never been one to go and make random friends, it's so much easier online, hehe, don't you agree?    I was looking through my old school stuff today, my mom has all my report cards, progress reports, awards, letters, sincr I was in kindergarten in New Jersey. It was weird. I even found my certificate that says i don't have to take the ESL (English as a Second Language) course anymore. How ironic, haha. I speak english so well now. =P I found a lot of things that belonged to my younger brother (the one i haven't seen in years), it made me sad. Well, that's all for now...c ya later people

        &nbsp;     Obscure Pictures     &nbsp;  Walking underneath blue skies,  and on top of unknown lands beneath.  A secluded patch of barren land fills my sight,  a land, with hidden secrets below.  Individual mysteries of the ages,  unbeknownst to you and I.  I walk into it; into another realm,  of deadly tranquility.  Pillars of truth and lies,  successes and failures,  and forgotten controversy,  as they fill the night.  &nbsp;  Opaque colors and granite stone,  of monumental and diminutive size  swarm around me.  Words inscribed in stone,  smooth and worn with age.  Others have just joined the family,  fresh and coarse words  accompany the eerie smell  of freshly turned soil.  &nbsp;  Wearing your identity on your sleeve,  proclaiming who you were,  and who you aren’t anymore.  Beneath your tag, you are never seen,  for what you are.  Encased in wood, and comforted by satin,  what is left of you rests,  forever, in a tormented state of peace.  Brittle bones that have turned to ash,  and ceased to exist.  Dead in my world,  reborn in yours.  &nbsp;  Your bare identity reveals nothing more of you.  Six feet under you lay, in a cold, desolate world,  expressed into insanity, where you will never be.  The earth you used to tread on is no longer the same,  a family you once knew has moved on, and left you behind.  Gone into the great beyond.  &nbsp;  There you are,  perpetually sleeping, in a comatose state,  of sub-consciousness.  Numb to the world around you, that was your only purpose.  Memories and dreams,  have soaked into the ground beneath.  Losing part of you, and gaining nothing from me.  -Written by...myself

      "Intelligence is an extremely subtle concept. It's a kind of  understanding that flourishes if it's combined with a good memory, but  exists anyway even in the absence of good memory. It's the ability to  draw consequences from causes, to make correct inferences, to foresee  what might be the result, to work out logical problems, to be  reasonable, rational, to have the ability to understand the solution  from perhaps insufficient information. You know when a person is  intelligent, but you can be easily fooled if you are not yourself  intelligent."   --Isaac Asimov

      Time goes by so fast. Everyday is spent in the same manner. Going around, doing nothing in particular, just wasting time.   Time, I believe, is one of those things that has no real definition. Time isn't constant as we believe it to be. I've always seen two ways to the beginning of everything. Creation and Evolution. Creation being the religious perspective and evolution being just that, evolving from  lesser creatures into what we are now.   Some say that God created space and time. But when asked: "So what was God doing before he created time [and the universe]? You don't reply: "He was preparing Hell for people who asked such questions". I don't believe God created the universe, or time for that matter. When someone asks how did life begin on this Earth most go on to explain how God created us, etc etc etc taking the path of creation. Explaining it through the area of evolution is trickier but more plausible in some ways. Since there are loads of different religions not everyone accepts God created us. Science on the other hand is fact, and therefore it has more reason to be believed.   Hmmm...those thoughts bring me to the subject of time travel! hahaha....it'd be cool to actually travel back in time. It's said that traveling into the future doesn't break any laws of nature but traveling into the past does. Hehe, imagine History becoming experimental. History is one of the only things we, at the present time, cannot alter. This also brings the question of the grandfather paradox. If you went back in time and murdered your grandfather, would you still exist? Or would you just pop out of existence in the future? When you kill your grandfather maybe time or something else will intervene and cause him to bend down and tie his shoe at the time you decide to put a bullet in him. Time itself would intervene in the series of events you would cause that alters the entire course of the future. Scary thought. Hmmm..ok enough of that for now...  I just read an interesting poem today called "Repression of War Experience" by Siegfried Sassoon....  Now light the candles; one; two; there’s a moth;	  What silly beggars they are to blunder in	  And scorch their wings with glory, liquid flame—	  No, no, not that,—it’s bad to think of war,	  When thoughts you’ve gagged all day come back to scare you; And it’s been proved that soldiers don’t go mad	  Unless they lose control of ugly thoughts...  hmm...that's only the first stanza, it's a good poem, it made me think a lot  Well that's all for the daily rants.....g'nite!

      I went to the psychologist this morning, it was weird. I don't like this new psychologist very much. I liked my old one better. This one has a funny way of looking at me, like she expects I'll snap at any moment. gahhh...i don't think those sessions are doing me any good.  I keep procrastinating!! My room still looks like shit, and I need to start doing my homework. Sander already finished reading the Hobbit + all the million questions last night....as for me...i'm on the first paragraph. Sander and I have a habit of running into each other, I saw her and her sister Linda at the library today (haven't been there in ages, I hope they forgot I owe like $17 in fines).   Band training on Monday! Yayness...there goes my summer. I'm kinda excited, kinda not. I wanna go tomorrow to the freshmen camp to help out with newbies. Volunteer Dey. Scary thought.  I walked outside today and I saw the frog my brother killed last night. It hasn't started decomposing yet, I know that nobody will clean it up because it blends in with the dirt so I'll watch it decompose everyday. That's a much better lesson on the  post mortem  process than what froguts.com could teach me.   Hmmm...new topic on the subject of the universe....I don't understand gamma ray blasts. Eh, maybe that will be the cause for the end of the universe. Too bad our lives are so short, we'll never find out everything we want to know.

Fave umm...everything...(wonders what Chris' fave boxers have on them, they better not be silk otherwise i'll think stuff)  3.  My clone! Can't live with him or without him!

      Today was boring...and my room is a mess, i need to do some major cleaning. I have to sweep up dead bugs and clean the spiderwebs around here.   We had thunderstorms today, it was great. The sky was bright as day till about 10PM. It was different shades of purple, pink, yellow, green, blue and black, I took some pictures. I loved it, the feeling the light cast on the ground was creepy.  I found a frog outside and my brother threw a rock on top of it. Small frog, big rock = guts out of the frog's mouth. Poor frog, I felt bad about it.  I'm having another one of my sad spells....just a feeling of loving myself/disliking myself. I always have the feeling that my life is just one big lie. No stability in it at all. I don't even feel like writing anymore because everything turns out the same, another pessimistic piece of crap that people think is great. Gah, I hate reading what I write, it's a load of bullshit to me at times, but it's true. Many of us don't have happy things to write about or uplifting things to make you feel better. In some ways it's easier to write about sad things or dark things, probably because we all associate with it more at this point in our lives. "Teen Angst" ha! what a load of crap! I don't like that term...so stereotypical. I don't concern myself with trivial things. What i worry about most is what will become of me. If you know my circumstances you can figure it out, if you don't, well maybe i'll tell you later on....

      Well what's to say....  Today I stayed home and sat on my ass. Met a cool Peruvian kid that has everything in common with me [not as much as you Chris! so don't worry] and that was a pretty eventful conversation. Talking about good Peruvian beer and cholos...hahahaha. Well band practice starts next week [dun dun dun!]...drumline sucks with all the n00bs, the theme sucks, the program basically went down the shitter this year =( but all we can do is hope for the best I guess. I missed my dentist appt. today [yay!!] Dentists' are evil evil evil  people...the smell of their office makes me gag. Well anyways, that's all for now!    //Dey

         I just took this from a portion of my xanga site....it's quite interesting...so I figured I would post it here.    WHATS THE PROBLEM WITH:        People: they concern themselves with trivial things. (probably because of capitalism) People are strange, they are the most powerful beings on this earth, and also the weakest. They give in to corruption, the government, greed...... They are the ones that create the world we live in, and ultimately, they will be the cause of our destruction.        Life: Again, one of the most controversial things. The basis is quite simple, but understanding the meaning of life, and what it is is nearly impossible. Life is great, if you make it to be. Sometimes we don't have that choice. Some of us are born into misfortune and failures. It's hard to break free, but the struggle is the part where life loses it's meaning. Life is a gift. Everyone dies, but not everyone lives.        Your country: Peru is my country. The US is my country. I consider them both to be my own, but in my heart, I'm from Peru, and that will always be home. The US is the most powerful country in the world, but they are too damn nosy. Everything here has a hidden part to it, it is called the land of opportunity, yet that isn't necessarily true. There are so many things wrong with this country, and nearly ALL of it comes from one source; the GOVERNMENT. Politics hurt our minds, our very beings. It dictates how we live and what we will make of ourselves. Our very existence depends on the balance in the world of politics, democracy and the government. The same applies for Peru, I don't remember much of it, but i left it because of politics, and oppression.

         I'm in pain.    My body feels old and everything aches. I don't know why. All of a sudden it just feels like my body has been battered and left to die.  Hmm.....  My birthday is this Sunday.    16   years on this planet.  I feel old already yet it's quite a young age to everyone else. I'm not looking forward to this birthday so much. I know my family won't be together so that's probably one of the reasons why I'm not planning on doing anything. I'll just spend it by myself, or with my parents. It may seem a bit dull to you, but this time,   I honestly don't see any importance in turning a year older  . I won't feel any different, nothing new will be bestowed upon me, nada.   Zero.   I don't care for "Sweet 16" parties and the like. I don't see it as anything more than   an opportunity to waste your money foolishly  . I didn't even have the traditional "quinciañera" all hispanic girls go psycho over. I have everything I need, and I don't believe turning 15 or 16 will   open my eyes to adulthood   or make me any wiser. It's just the way I am, I am....ME. I prefer to save my money and buy something useful. Perhaps I will regret this decision later on in life, but for now I   live in the present   and that is what I care about the most.  Another thought that has been on my mind lately is the pondering of my recent   "symbolic" nightmares  . I have never dreamt so often in my life. Perhaps it means something?  A couple of days ago I dreamt I was in a graveyard that was overlooked by an immense temple. The temple was enormous and looked ancient, I remember a year.   A.D. 1111  . I have seen that number before yet I forget what it symbolizes. There was a mist shrouding the graves, which were quite old, but one detail that I remember vividly is noticing the   graves of children  . I was just walking through these graves in this oppresive environment as peacefully as ever. Not noticing the   scent of death  .  Yesterday I got home around 10AM, I immediately went to sleep. As soon as I fell asleep I was pulled into another dream. In this dream I was fighting with two, seemingly   demonic beings  . I wasn't sure what they were. They had human form, but they were something else. What I remember most is the sensation of being   bitten   on my right shoulder. It was so painful that I went   numb   from my fingertips all the way up to my shoulder. That's when I jerked awake, I   felt the pain   in my shoulder and I was   disoriented   for quite a while. It was so realistic, I actually felt the pain the rest of the day.  Then last night I had the most puzzling of dreams. I dreamt of   a young man I didn't recognize  . I was nearly   killed   in that dream. It was a scene of torture, although this time I didn't feel the pain in reality. I remember him putting   crushed glass in the palm of my hand  blood rushing from the wounds   and making me close my hand with his around it, pressing my flesh against the glass. Then i had the feeling of   being cut   over and over and over again. I saw myself, but I saw myself from the   perspective of someone else  . I   don't   remember seeing myself   cry   or   wince from the pain  . I just took the abuse as if I could not feel a thing. I just saw   flesh and blood  . The one detail I remember most is the   black clothing and crushed glass.    In a short dreaming following that, I saw myself falling over a   waterfall  , down into the waters below. I lived. I   didn't feel   any   fear  , or   pain  . It was pure....  tranquility  .       I don't know if this is trying to tell me something. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, I will just have to find out sooner or later. All I can do for now is ponder away.....

       These days the music industry seems to put out worthless commercial crap. Rap has gone to hell; all we see is vulgarity in their videos, music, image, etc. The era of teen pop is over and done with. Or is it? Everyday we have these 13-17 year old artists coming out with "pop/rock" albums, full of songs that talk about the same things and melodies that sound the same. We have them talking about relationships, sex, drugs, violence, etc. People actually buy this and like it.  Every year it gets worse. Decency (even to a limited extent) has gone to hell, lyrics are more raunchy, videos are bordering on porn; it's disgusting really.  It's good music they say. Ha! People have lost the idea of what "good music" is. Give them some sugar coated album by some 13 year old and it's "omg she's so talented!!! she's gonna be around forever!!! Grammy!!". Same thing with any rap/r&amp;b artist. Rock has also lost the foundation of what it used to be. Thankfully for me, I still love trance.....and you don't hear it on the radio here, in other bigger cities, yeah, but not here. Hehe, at least the scene hasn't gone to hell just yet.

       Sometimes I would like to be alone all the time, the peace is unrelenting and it's so....precious. Then people come inflitrate my world and it all starts. The constant bitching, the orders, the excuses, the insults. I wish I could shut off my ears to all their idiosyncrasies. It's poison, that's all it is. It ruins me and makes my happiness decompose as rapidly as some dead animal, it's slow, the acrid feelings linger for ages, and it's torturing. You just want it to end, the end is the biggest reward. It's like being on a bad acid trip, it's wonderful in the beginning and then you crash, it's terrible. (From what I know and have seen, it's not like I use drugs). Such a change of moods makes you angry, unreasonable, and then they take it out on me. It's not a great feeling to have your mother call you a "demented freak" or an "antisocial idiot". That's what leads me to write these depressing entries. I don't enjoy it, I want to write about something happy for once. I don't want to come off as pessimistic, I love life. I just want to enjoy it and be free from everyone. I am made happy everyday by someone but it's a terrible feeling to know it won't last once those people decide to come here and ruin me, everyday. Then I just have my few happy memories to hang on to, and that gets me through the day. Someone saves me everyday. =) Yeah, those are my few little rants for today.   I'm tired.
