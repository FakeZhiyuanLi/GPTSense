      Well here we are in the great state of Oklahoma! Quaide and I got here Saturday night and yesterday we went to our home church to see all of our friends. Everyone was so excited to see us and very warm and welcoming. Being Father's Day, after church we headed to my sisters house for lunch and a nap before heading back to church for the evening service. Man, this reminds me how fast pace our lives used to be when we lived here. We're just sliding right back into the pace of things. Today we don't have anything planned, just hanging out with my Mom and doing some running around. Quaide hasn't had much of an appetite so right now he's munching on some strawberries. They definitely are not as good as Oregon's but let me tell you about the watermelon we had yesterday....it was sooo good!  Last night we had such a HUGE thunder and lightning storm. It was kinda scary as I am out of experience with these. It kept me up most of the night and Quaide came toddling in to my room right before it started and then preceded to sleep through it. I was thankful for that. The wind was blowing so hard and the rain was pelting the windows, it fell like it was going to break them. But I finally fell asleep, only to be awoken by the cat howling in the back yard and the alarm beeping as my dad went outside to tend to it. Mom and Dad's new house is beautiful. It's still kind of weird for me, it's all of their stuff but just doesn't feel quite like home yet. I'm sure it will be a different story in a few days. Everything's so new and clean, I don't want Quaide to mess anything up. Well, I need to get going, I've got a birthday party to plan!

      Today was a beautiful and busy day. We started out by going to Mt.Tabor Park and meeting some new friends. Danielle and her son Jack, Amy and her daughter Elliott, and another mother and her son whom I cannot remember their names for the life of me. They both had unusual names and I couldn't even remember them to say goodbye with but I hope we see them all again after we get back from our trip to Oklahoma. Quaide had such a great time being around other children. Danielle and Jack met us for lunch at Peanut Butter and Ellies and although the wait was ridiculous (though completely normal for this place)the boys enjoyed playing together on the train and coloring on the walls with the chalk. I took some of Quaide's baby clothes over to Zanzibar Consignment Store which is two doors down, trying to get some extra cash for our upcoming week. It was so hard letting go of some of his precious little outfits. Anyway, on the way home Quaide fell asleep and slept all the way through me carrying him upstairs to his bedroom. After his nap, we went to Target to buy him a little cheapo plastic swimming pool. I wanted something for him to cool off in as it will be getting up to 90 degrees in the next 2-3 days. We don't have air conditioning which is pretty normal here in Oregon but with us having our rooms in the attic area, it gets really hot, really fast. Oklahoma is going to be much hotter but as long as I have air conditioning, I can survive.

       urlLink    We went fishing at Hagg Lake today. Despite the cool temperature and the wind, and the fact that none of us caught a single fish, we had a pretty decent time. 6-13-04&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This, of course, was Quaide's favorite float. He is really into crocodiles lately. He says "Crikey it's a Croc!"- like the Crocodile Hunter!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Had a great time at the Portland Rose Festival Parade this morning. It amazed me how there were people who literally pitched a tent and camped out to get a good seat. We showed up about 20 minutes late and were able to stand pretty close. Good times...good times!&nbsp; urlLink

      I have to write this down before I forget. Morning times truely are some of the best times with Quaide. It's a clean slate and he's usually so sweet and has his dreams fresh in his mind. So, I always pick his brain to see what he comes up with. This morning he started to tell me a story and this is how it went: "The little baby shark said, 'Where's my Mommy?' and the Daddy Shark said, 'Shhh. She's laying down taking a nap.' and the baby shark said (in the sweetest, high voice)'Okay, are we going to cool (school) today?' and daddy shark said 'Yes, we are all going to cool.' and then they went to cool all day long."  I told him what a wonderful story that was and thanks for telling it to me. He was so proud of his accomplishment. In hindsight now, I think this sounds somewhat like "Finding Nemo" although he hasn't watched it in a while. Ya just never know...  Oh! Last night as I was reading him his bedtime stories, we were reading Dr. Seuss' ABC Book (Ya know, Big A, Little A, what begins with A?), anyway at the very very last page on the back cover of the book it has the entire alphabet with upper and lowercases kind of in order but not in straight lines, so Quaide wanted me to ask him to point out letters. So I did the ones I knew I had tought him, as stated in an earlier post: A,D,E,I,M,O,Q,U,and X and then he said "Which one other ones?" So I asked him and he knew the N,S,and the T as well. He said t-t-t-t Tad! He has a LeapFrog video that teaches him the letters as well and it just always amazes me when he knows these things that I know I didn't teach him. He's just a sponge right now. It's great!  We are off to the Portland Rose Festival Parade this morning, can't wait. I'm sure I'll have pictures to follow...

      My silly, silly son came into my room first thing this morning talking about marching bands and how his "Most Favoritest" is a drumbone. Meaning, trombone. Then he said, "No, a clareteck." (clarinet) He is really interested in instruments lately, I can't wait to get him into some kind of lessons when he's a little bit older. I think he'll be very good at it, he's so musical. When I play the piano, he likes to count the beats with me. I've taught him how to count in 4/4. Anyway... he is really athletic as well but there's a slight problem. He has his mothers gracefullness! I'm serious, he'll come running in the room (just like this morning) yelling about something and all you see is his big eyes as he falls to the ground. He doesn't need anything but his own feet to trip on. It's just like the movies- I always seem to see it in slow motion. And he doesn't cry or anything, he's so used to it, he just picks himself back up and continues what he was saying. It's quite hilarious actually. My silly, silly boy!

      Well, I am constantly saying that I need to start something like this for the future of our family. I feel so ashamed that I have not journaled more of Quaide's life over the past almost 3 years. Three Years! I can't believe he'll be turning 3 next month. Time does go by so quickly. Yes, yes, I do scrapbook but it's mainly just to preserve my photos, I haven't even done much journaling on it! I don't think I know exactly when Quaide took his first steps or quit breastfeeding, I do know that it happened around the same time. When he was about 10-11 months old. I don't know the day he got his first teeth or any after for that matter. I think it was also around 10 months. Am I a horrible mother for not knowing that? He has really been maturing lately. He pretty much carries on full conversations with us now. Us being, myself, his Daddy, Grammy, and Papa Ron. We are all living together here in Portland. We are really missing family and friends in Oklahoma and my brother and his family who just moved to Alabama. Thus the name: Oregonoklabama. Anyway, Quaide talks so well. He told the lady at the store just today that she was "Delicious" although he doesn't know what that means. It reminded me of when his cousin, Zane, used to do the same thing, trying to impress people with his vocabulary. The funniest thing Quaide says lately is.. Coffee Cup. Yes, that's right, Coffee Cup. I have no earthly idea why or where he gets this from, I think he just likes the way it rolls of his tongue. Out of no where he'll just say, "Coffee Cup". It cracks us up. Which brings me to another favored saying of his "You're cracking me up"- he gets this from his Papa Ron. Which brings me to yet another: "You're killing me"- we don't like that so we don't encourage it. Let's see, what are his major accomplishments as of late? He can count to pretty much anything as long as I prompt him on the 10's. He can get to 20 all by himself. And he can count to 10 in Spanish. He started writing his name about a week ago. It's really amazing how good he is at it. He knows Q,U,A,I,D,E,O,M,S,T, and X(for xylophone he says). He knows all of his shapes and just today at lunchtime, he learned how to draw a person using the triangle for the body, a circle for the head and attatching arms and legs. He was so proud of himself. I had a moment of pride myself as I realized it was his first recognizable picture. And do you know what I did with his first ever drawing? I left it at the restaurant, didn't even think twice about it...Until now! Dumb me. Let's see... He also knows lots and lots of Sign Language, although he doesn't use it anymore unless we ask him to. I really wish there was something I could do to make him keep that, it's just kind of useless right now. He has known all of his colors for some time. He loves coloring, also gluing and cutting with scissors. He's pretty good at cutting- a lady at a church we visited said he's "advanced" for his age. Yep, huff-huff, that's my boy! Anyway, I'm gonna move on and see what all else this blog thingy has, I think it'll be fun! ~Ali

      I have been getting stricter on Quaide about going on the potty. He's just sooo content with going in his diaper! Ughh! He does pretty well with peeing on it (that is, when I prompt him to) but he's never once went poo-poo on it. I'm really hoping that he's completely potty trained before he starts kindergarten! Haha. Quaide is recognizing all of the letters in the alphabet. His favorite thing to do lately is say all of the letters on our shirts or whatever else has lots of letters for him to read. I'm thinking he'll be reading some by the end of the year! He's so smart and I just pray that Trey and I can keep up with his capacity for knowledge. Quaide's been doing somewhat&nbsp; better with minding us. After our 3 week trip to Oklahoma, he came home a little more spoiled than when we left. :) He's slowly learning...

      Having problems uploading pictures so none this time. We are finally home from our whirlwind visit to Oklahoma. 3 weeks still just wasn't enough time to visit with everyone that I wanted to. Quaide was so excited to be around all of his old buddies and now that we are back, I anticipate him having withdrawals. It helped that we were able to see his new friend, Jack, today. It's been sooo hot here today that it feels a little like home except without air conditioning. What is up with that??? Apparently, nobody has a/c around here. They say you don't really need it or something crazy like that but I say, it's worth it even if it is for just a couple of months a year. Why torture yourself for the sake of saving a few extra bucks??? Anyway, tomorrow my baby turns 3. Yes, 3 years old! I can't believe it. He still isn't minding me any better.... I'm waiting for that day to come. A lady at the ball field told me tonight that he'll get better when he's 5. Man, can I wait that long? Guess I don't have a choice. He ran away from me and Trey as we were going back to the car- he ran right to the play structure after we specifically told him to stay by us. He doesn't care what we say, he dances to the beat of his own drum as they say. His punishment was no toys or anything when we got home. He went straight to the bath and then straight to bed. He didn't seem to even notice. Ughhh!!! I love him though and tomorrow I too celebrate the birth of my own motherhood. I am so blessed to be his mommy.
