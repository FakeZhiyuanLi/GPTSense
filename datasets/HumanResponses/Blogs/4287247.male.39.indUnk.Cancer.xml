      I had my first Lap Dance tonight.  I'm not sure why tonight except that I'm staying with my grandmother while I'm visiting my family.  When I do that I generally go to some local video booths at night a couple of times a week.  If you don't know what that is that's where you go to these itty bitty booths, one chair per booth only slightly larger than a phone booth.  In each booth is a TV showing porn on 4 to 100 channels depending on the place.  You get in, lock the door, put in some money and whack off.  If you think that's strange or perverted first I'll point out that most sex advice columns like in Time Magazine or MSNBC.com or Glamour or Cosmo will tell you if you don't masterbate, you're the weird one not me.  And second since I'm at my grandmother's it's not that convienent to do it at home.  Anyway, with that situation and also feeling like I said before in so much need of physical contact I decided to stop by a strip club and get a lap dance.  It's taking me many years to get up to this point.  I'm in my mid 30s and this was my first time and only my 3rd time to a strip club.  I know quite a few people that have gone quite a few more times and I'm not talking about geeky or can't get a girl people either.  It was quite interesting.  Compared to the other 2 strip clubs I had been to the girls were pretty agressive here which I was told by my friends that took me to the other 2 is more the norm.  At the other two I guess there were not so many girls and too many guys so the girls didn't have to work at it to get a customer.  I turned down the first couple of girls.  I was trembling and my hands were freezing and I was hoping to get calmed down and my hands warmed before I went for it but the 3rd or 4th girl that asked was fairly agressive and good looking, closer to my type than most.  She sat down on my lap and asked me several times.  I declined a couple of times but she wore me down and so I said yes.  I know that every club is different and each city, county, country has different laws and this being my first I wasn't sure what I could and couldn't do or where it would lead.  This place had semi private booths around the room which was nice so didn't think about people looking on.  I told the girl I was a lap dance virgin.  She didn't say anything so I'm not sure if she didn't hear or thought "they always say that" or what.  Anyway she started by climbing on my lap her back to mine and reached behind her and massaged me thought my pants.  Then she got off and pushed her ass in my crotch and ground it in.  She then took my hands on put them on her bare stomach giving me the okay to touch her.  For those that have seen the movie "Go" you can see this place was different.  I really liked rubbing my hands over her body, feeling her stomach, legs, back, arms and her pushing her head back so I could smell her hair.  I closed my eyes and just wished it was my lover instead of this lap dance girl. She turned around on pushed her breasts up into my face with a bikini on.  That was nice too. Both to have soft breasts brushing my face and also to be that physically close to a woman.  I put my arms around her and firmly caressed her back and butt and legs.  At one point she put my hand on her bikini covered crotch and had me rub.  She leaned back to one side of me and put her knees toward her chest to make it easier to rub..  To be honest I wasn't really interested in that. Sure if it was my girlfriend but really I just liked touching her skin/body.   She had very nice smooth skin except for one large bump/mole/pimple/cyst/boyle on the back of her thigh.  I was a little afraid of it.  What if it was a shanker sore for example.  Interestingly I didn't get hard or not that hard.  I suppose it was being nervous though I didn't feel that nervous.  Supposedly I got a 2 for 1 deal.  It was $20 and went by pretty quick so I can't imaging how short a normal deal is.  She asked if I wanted another 2 for 1 deal and I said no.  I sat back down in the main room around the stage and thought about doing it once more with a different girl but after about 20 minutes I didn't really see another girl I really wanted to do it with so after another 5 minutes I took off.  I think you could pay more for her to get naked but after it was over I thought about that and I think I prefered it clothed.  Naked, one I'd have to touch her breasts and although that would be nice I think as she's not my lover and I'm not trying to get her off I prefered just to caress her body has that felt good.  Second, if her crotch was naked I would be thinking about disease.  Maybe that's stupid but ...  I know that in Japan there are places you can make out with the women and lick their bodies.  I'm not sure that's something I'd be interested in because I'd be thinking I'm licking the same thing the last guy did 20 minutes ago.  Kind of scary.   I can say that I would totally enjoy some kind of similar action from my girlfriend.  That made me wonder if there is any similar behavior that most women would enjoy.  It almost seems like it has to be a woman doing the *lap* dance because most women are smaller than most men so having a man dance in the lap of a woman sounds like the woman might get crushed.  Also wiggling an ass in a woman's crotch just doesn't seem like it would have the same physical effect.  I guess I can just hope if I find a girlfriend that will do something like this for me she'll enjoy my caresses, more if she want's more and my total attention and attraction to her.

      Today I saw my cousin's place.  Him and his wife are living in a very cool old house in the historic district of his city.  The house has been redone both inside and out and is just beautiful.  I was very very happy for him but at the same time I was feeling very late for myself as in "why don't I have a place like this with wonderful wife and lots of friends and family visiting often"  If fact it wasn't just a small feeling it was really upsetting to me.   My best friend also recently bought a house and just moved into it.  I haven't seen it yet but he's got some money and he's gotten a place like 3 houses from the beach.  Him and his beautiful, smart, cool, loving wife are in the process of having it adjusted to their liking.  Moving walls, having parts remodled etc.  In a way I'm not sure I want to see it because I know I'll be extremely jealous.  How do I get there from here?  Can I get myself to take the steps required?  Is it that simple as decided to do it or does it require more luck than sweat?  I guess I believe in the sweat side of that.

      I'm looking for a LOVER!!!  Someone to be in love with and that is in love with me.  I want to stare into each other's eyes.  I want to wrap my arms around you and have you wrap your arms around me.  To go on dates, to buy small presents for each other, to spend special holidays together.  To share music, movies, dinning and travel.  I'm also looking for a best friend.  Someone to talk to, to exchange ideas, advice, opinions, feelings with.  To do projects together whether is buying furnature, redecorating a room or garden or making crafts or a website.  Someone to share a life with.  On top of all that I want a sexual and flirtatious relationship.  Flirting with each other, pleasuring each other, enjoying each other in that way on a regular basis.  Finding each other attractive, a turn on, exciting and fun.

      It's Christmas Eve and I'm fucking lonely.  I fucking hate being lonely and I feel like I've been lonely most of my life.  Maybe it's one of those things where I'm just focusing on the wrong stuff.  I'm visiting my grandmother.  She loves me.  I'll see 2 aunts, 2 uncles, 3 cousins, 2 grandmas, my Mom and a few other people on Christmas.  But, that's not enough.  I want a girlfriend.  It's been 4 years since my last girlfriend and she was pretty much perfect.  It's a long story why we split up, it had mostly to do with timing and opportunities, think "the Family Guy" except the none fairytale version where somebody had an opportunity except both agreed that it had to be taken and both knew full well that that meant the end of the relationship.  Anyway, you'll just have to except that it makes sense for now but that doesn't mean I don't still long for her. *if you're wondering she's now married with kid*.  I know there is a tendency to gloss over any problems but to be perfectly honest there were none except for the whole timing thing.  Had we not split up I have no guarentee that we would still be together but still, she did seem like a perfect match.  She excepted who I am, liked me, had the similar interests I'd always been looking for.  She was attractive to me, not a prude, creative and also my best friend at the time.  I'm not stupid, I know she's moved on with her life.  I know there are other fish in the ocean.  I'm not wanting her in particular back but I am wanting a woman in my life as my best friend and lover and whenever that thought comes up of course I think at least a little about her. There are quite a few women in my life but none more than casual friends as in I see them once a month or less.  And of course I'm constantly evaluating if one of them is a *match*.  Are they best friend potential.  Of course my take on that is that for the most part that should just happen but I'm coming to realize that I guess that's not so true.  It seems like most people just go for looks and then after starting a relationship they get to know each other and become friends.  If they are compatible they become friends, if not they break up and move on to the next *looker*.  I don't know if that's the most common way but it isn't rare.  Me though, I'm too conscience about it, my heart says that kissing and sleeping with somebody is saying "I love you" to the other person (I guess that's a concept in Vanilla Sky which I haven't seen yet.)  But, my point is it's not so easy for me to start a relationship quick and jump in the sack.  If I knew the woman didn't care.  She was just looking for sex and hoping maybe things might get better later I might be able to go for it but most of the women I've met and that I'm hanging out with would consider it an "I love you" issue and I don't seem to be able to deal with that lie.  So, I wait and like previous girlfriends, hope that at some point it will be clear to me that I'm truely interested and so is she.  Of course that's always taken 6 months in the past and giving that for the last 8 years or so nearly every woman in my life is someone I see less than once a month that's not quite the situation that's going to generate a good friend that would turn into more than a friend.  Anyway, that seemed a bit off topic when what I really want to write about is how much I want to be in love with someone. There's the physical part.  Of course I want sex, I want snuggles, I want hugs, I want permission to touch somebody often.  Walk around and come up from behind and wrap my arms around them.  Sit next to them and rub arms.  The scary thing is I want it so bad recently that any half way attractive woman I see I almost feel like walking up to them and touching them like a boyfriend would.  It's kind of scary.  Also kind of scary is I can hear myself trying to rationalize a relationship with women that I know I'm not a match for.  Just because I so long for the physical part if I can have nothing else.  Simple things, riding around in a car and sliding my finger down her arm as she's looking out the window.  Even just sharing the same space.  There are about 8 women in my life.  MK I'm not physically attracted to at all.  She looks like an eskimo to me.  Sorry if you or your friends are part eskimo but I have yet to see of picture of an attractive eskimo.  She's a nice person but there is no special other attraction to overcome the lack of any physical attraction.  Another woman is a smoker and very very strong believer in astrology.  Both big problems. She is extremely beautiful and has made it very clear she is intersted in me but I can't get myself to go down that road knowing like I said above that jumping in bed to me means saying "I love you".  Another women is 11 years younger than me and is still living at home.  I don't want to be her dad.  She seems interested but her signals are not strong so I'm not sure and, at least for me, the vision in my head of a relationship is that once it *starts* you pretty much are sleeping together on a regular basis.  As she lives at home that seems pretty much impossible.  I wouldn't be able to sleep at her place and she can't stay out all night as her parents are watching.  I suppose that's over thinking it but it does seem like an impossible situation.  Another women I've known for about 5 years now.  She used to be a roommate.  She's one of the nicest people I know but we have nothing at all in common.  I was watching some drama and there was a woman who seems very much like her.  So nice that she ends up being the backbone of a family that is having some troubles.  People have pointed out how that's supposedly the *perfect* type of woman, especially in many asian cultures and so I've thought about her.  Should I persue her for that reason?  She's also very beautiful but we really have almost zero in common?  Another women I know is a friend of the previous women.  She's probably got the best body of all the women.  I have no idea if she knows how to use it but she does know how to show it off.  She's creative and likes to do crafts but again there is very little in common.  There are 3 or 4 others that I know much less well and that I would not really considier friends yet but I still think about them as in should I just go for it and try to, for lack of a better word, "pick one up".  I've got no idea.  If there was some women that I knew I had the stuff in common and I'm looking for (ie, similar to my last girlfriend) and I was also at least mildly physically attracted (ie, I liked her face) then I think I would have no problem pursuing.  As it is though all the women I know have such big question marks over their heads for me that I'm not ready to pursue since if during the pursuit I figured out I was not interested and then had to try to get out.  When I mentioned that my last girlfriend excepted me, more than just liking me (which I often feel undisirable even if there is plenty of evidence to the contrary), my last girlfriend for example excepted my strange porn fetish.  What does that mean?  Well, for the last few years I've been into Japanese anime or manga porn.  If you've seen Urotsukudoji you have some idea have how strange it can get.  There is tons of sex related manga and anime from Japan.  It's huge!  Some people (with small minds IMO) don't get it.  How can a drawing of people having sex do anything for someone.  My response to that is that (1) Penthouse forum doesn't have any photos and people still get off on the stories so likewise these are just illustrated stories and (2) it's fantasy.  Sexual fantasy is a pretty open ended issue.  For me sexual fantasy is 100% about pleasure and many of the fantasy images in the strange porn manga look very pleasureable.  People / creatures with multiple penises.  Women doing it with octopus like creatures so they have 8 arms touching more than 2 amrs could.  Etc, etc.  There's a mix though.  Any scene/story where one person appears not to be enjoying it turns me off which would pretty much cover most of the Urotsukudoji series.  Anyway, my last girlfriend not only had no problem with that but was interested in at least looking at it (and no, that was not a request on my part).  Another women I started something with didn't mind that I read it but didn't personally have any interest in looking at it.  She was also not very good in bed nor did she seem to have much of a concept of what love-making is about other than wham-bam have I done my duty yet.  Yuck!  So, although I'm pretty sure I'll eventually find another match sometimes the odds seem overwhelming.

       What is it about me and pining?  There's this woman who I have spent no time alone with.  I did spend 7 days with her and another woman showing them around LA and Vegas.  During that time I feel for Ms.R very very hard though with Ms.S also around I didn't say anything or make any moves though I do think I showed at least that I was interested.  Anyway, now I've been home two and a 1/2 weeks and I have not seen either of them but particularly Ms.R.  She's super busy, 3 jobs so she has no time to meet.  It makes me wonder if things did work out would I get to see her because basically it seems like unless she moves in with me the odds are that no, I will not get to see her.  But anyway, the thing is, I find myself up all night thinking about her.  Wanting to transmit my thoughts to her, to talk to her, to hold her etc.  I know this is normal, you can read about in just about every love story or hear about it in every other love song.  (Can't eat, can't sleep etc)  But, I'm 36 and I'm mostly over that kind of stuff.  I have no trouble eating (though being 15 to 20 lbs over weight and wanting to attract this women I have been eating less)  but, as I lay awake at night, at least for an hour or two pining for her also in the back of my mind are several thoughts.  One, happiness that I'm having these feelings as it's been a while since I've been so interested in someone.  Another is though is that it's stupid, I can't transmit my feelings by telepathy (I'd like to believe I could but I know better).  Also I really don't know this woman.  Our only time together so far as been that week with the 3 of us so I've spent no time alone with her.  I have no idea if we are really a match or even if we'd have fun together outside of that special situation of me showing them all over LA and Vegas since I know both of them fairly well.  This leads to the thought that I just want to call her up and tell her "I'm totally and utterly infatuated with you" or maybe even I'm "In love with you" though I'm afraid to say that last one although it's how I feel I don't know if it's a long term feeling or not.

      I just went on Nevre.com and noticed an article about anime ( urlLink http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/Murnighan/anime/ ) so I posted this response:  Well I have to say I'm a little disappointed. Although the author saw some anime, Venus 5 is pretty old. Nor does the majority of Japanese anime released in the U.S. represent the norm in adult oriented anime in Japan. Tenticaled beast anime porn is actually pretty hard to find here. You acutally get more just general sex except it's animated.  Also, the author clearly comes from a bias that anime porn is strange/bad/wierd, pick your negative image. Although I'd guess one might get that from the releases in the states I find it no different in essence than reading Penthouse forum. Clearly those stories are made up or at least some of them are. Porn Manga and Porn anime are just illustrated stories. Going back to your Claudia Schiffer images clearly suggests the anime didn't do it for you.  What I get out of fantasy sexual materials is the fantasy that one can have extraordinary pleasure. The rape scenes do bother me but again those are not the norm. But, what I generally get out of porn anime and porn manga is the dream of super pleasure.  In one manga, a girl and her girl friend enters a VR machine. In the machine the main girl has a penis. The friend has a ring about 3 inches across. She slips it over her friend's penis, clicks a button and the ring splits in half becoming two rings and essentially becomes a portal. The girl's penis goes in ring #1 and comes out ring #2. This allows the friend to suck the penis, then the main girl to suck her own penis. Then to use her own penis to fuck herself therefore feeling both the pleasure of a penis during sex and the pleasue of a vagina during sex. At one point the friend takes ring #2 and puts it inside the girl's vagina pointing outward so that as the girl slides ring #1 up and down over her penis it's coming out of ring #2 deep inside her vagina with the tip eventually appearing at her entrance. Sounds pretty pleasureable to me if it was possible.  Another similar idea you can find is what are called Dick Girls. Basically hermaphodites. Either the girls have a dick where their clitoris would be, or it looks like a regular clit until they play with it at which point it grows into a large penis, or another variation is it's above the clit and their clit is also nearly has large as a penis. In any case, it looks extremely pleasurable. Also, seeing two dick girls doing each other has the attraction of watching a girl girl scene except it has the added bonus that for a guy, there is something to identify with. The feeling of having your dick being pleasured. Sometimes the dicks are enourmous so while one dick girl #1 has her cock in the cunt of dick girl #2. dick girl #2 has her long dick up her stomach, between her enourmous breast and is giving herself head.  If you're curious about some of this stuff, one of the monthly magazines that sometimes carries it is called Angel.  urlLink http://www.angelweb.co.jp/

       DAMIT I WANT SEX!!!!!  F*CK!!!!  WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY MORALS AND WORRIES!!!  Morals prevent me from just sleeping with anyone. I haven't seen Vanilla Sky but in the trailer at appears that Tom Cruise's character has casual sex with Cameron Diaz's character. Thinking it's just casual, he then falls for a different women at which point Cameron Diaz goes crazy and tells him something like "when you have sex with someone your body makes a promise whether you do or not" That's the issue for me. I've probably met at least 4 women in the last year which, if I had asked or made a few moves I could have slept with. But, it seems like, in almost all cases, I would have been lying to them with my body. They would think I wanted more then just sex, that I wanted to be their boyfriend, that I wanted a relationship and since I was not attracted enough to want that I didn't pursue just sex.  And, even if I did have the balls to ask for just sex as in "I don't really want to be your boyfriend but if you just want sex l'd be happy to take you home", even if I had the guts to ask that and the luck to get a positive answer, so far in my limited experience there is no such thing as no strings attached. One or the other of us will hope that it means more. That through the act of sex a connection will be made, one will start liking the other etc.  But, damit, the media (movies, tv dramas etc) and media's portrayal of popular culture (mtv, kroq, janet jackson) basically puts forth the message that everybody is screwing their brains out except me. In fact the message seem to be, meet, have sex, decide later if you want to meet again.  In completely other news, I read/watch a f*cking lot of pr0n. Well, maybe not that much. Maybe not more than the average guy. I really have no idea. I had a male roommate once, a does well with the women type and his stash of pr0n mags was bigger than mine though I probably had more movies.  But, in the last few years, I've gotten into pr0n comics. Now I know, some of you will think "That's stupid, who could get off on pictures". Well, to that, I can point out that plenty of people get off on stories as in Penthouse Forum, Variations, those sex story books. Even one of my x-girlfriends wanted to point out to me how ranchy her romance novels got.  But, more so than at least the published sex books, published comics have new and interesting ideas. For example the Xenophobe series available at  urlLink http://eroscomics.com/  has quite a few interesting idea about sex with aliens, sex with creatures like a man that's been turned into a centaur (half horse) and all kinds of stuff. There's also the videos I mentioned before with multi-penised demons doing 50 girls at once with one or more penises in every hole and others fondling. If it's a rape scene than I usually get upset but if it's just about pleasure, I have no idea what it feels like to be a women but it's easy to imaging such a thing would be very very pleasurable.  One genre that really does it for me is though, recently is what's called Dick Girls. I'm sure it sounds kind of scary but a Dick Girl is just that. A girl with a dick. Not instead of a cunt but usually, instead of a clitoris. In other words, where her clitoris would be is a 10 inch dick. Sometimes it's just there, other times it's an arousal thing. She looks normal until she rubs it a little and it grows out. Of course, having all the parts looks extremely pleasurable. Of course like all comics it's a fantasy. Just like all anime girls have huge eyes and look cute but if a real girl had such huge eyes they'd look discusting I suspect that for the most part, if a person really did have both parts it might be pretty scary. I know such people supposedly exist and there are pr0n videos, most of them fake, about hermaphidites (people with both parts) but, of the ones I've seen, most of them fail to be all that interesting.  Dick Girls on the other hand, being total fantasy, I find it quite intersting. Kind of like watching a girl girl scene except there's a cock or two involved so I can certainly imaging the cock feelings where as a normal girl girl scene may be intersting but I have no idea what if feels like to have cunt so I can't sympathize as well I suppose.  Of course there's all kind of variations ( urlLink http://www.phoenix-c.or.jp/~meta/gal.adl2.htm ) Often, the cock is not in lue of a clit but is above it and the clit is also enormous.

       What is it about women!!! Is our (men's) programming that strong! When I see a thin waisted woman my heart just melts. I'm sitting here on a Singapore Airlines Flight and the stewardesses' dresses accentuate their figures so perfectly. It just makes me want to reach out, slide my hand along the inside of that wonderous curve at about the naval height and pull them to me.  In other news I wrote something on Jan 7th, about a full screen's worth that I completely lost. F**K!

      It sure seems like I'd be happier with a lobotomy.  Then I wouldn't over think things etc.  I wonder if life is really about having enough distractions in your life so that you don't have to think about it.  Instead you can think about who's going to take the kids to their baseball game or what you are going to wear to the company party.  Anyway, as I wrote last I've fallen for Ms. R.  The 2 day following my last entry were bliss.  It seemed to me she was interested in me too.  I didn't make any moves because Ms. S was around but every moment of the day I wanted to reach out and hold her and kiss her.  She seemed to be paying more attention to me and also seemed to be using a softer voice as though she was trying to attract me.  Of course my over thinking mind says it's all in my head, my hyper interest has just made me over sensitive to her presence and in actuality nothing has changed.  Still, I've resolved myself to at least go for it.  There's the big complication that Ms. S might be interested in which case she will be disappointed if I go for Ms. R.  But, I'm not interested in Ms. S and I am in Ms. R so as I keep telling myself there's nothing to do but try.  If I don't try, eventually I will unlikely be best friends sometime in the future.  If I try and fail I get the same result.  The only way to get any results is to try.  So, I sent off a quick e-mail in Japanese saying I something like "HELP!  I want to meet you.  I still have no job so I'm free even on weekdays.  If you have time, lets us 2 go out for dinner sometime".  I'm not sure if that's what I wrote since it's in Japanese and I'm bound the make mistakes.  The answer I got back is "I turned the photos in and they should be back in 4 days.  I'm pretty busy with various stuff but I'll try to get the photos to you as soon as possible."  Should I read into that that she's not interested?  Should I read nothing into that?  Thinking back this reminds me of my X-wife.  When I first started dating her I was nearly 100% sure she was interested but after our first short date/talk.  It wasn't much more than a walk on the beach.  Anyway, I don't remember what she said the next day but it was something that to me suggested she didn't want to see me.  On top of that the next song I heard was that song that starts "One is the lonliest number that there's ever been".  I balled my eyes out.  Of course the stupid thing was that I jumped to conclusions because either the same day or the next night we hooked up again.  So, as I say I over think everything.  Is this woman right for me?  She's 9-10 years younger than me.  Am I really interested?  I notice myself attracted to like every 8th woman I see.  I'm not used to that.  It used to be that when I had a crush on one woman I tuned all others out.  If this woman is intersted will she still be in 10 years when I'm 46 and she's 37?  She's very into clothing.  I've almost always considered myself not to like that trait in a woman.  Now I find myself rationalizing it as a hobby as opposed to being shallow and finding myself saying things like "I like clothing too" which is true since just before I was with my X-wife I got into it.  I got out of it after we got married.  My think though I like to find bargins though of course if someone else was paying I wouldn't mind a few expensive brand clothes.  Then, I try to tell myself it doesn't matter if she's right long term.  I should just go for it and if it's short term at least it should be fun for a while.  That's fine.  I think I can hang with that.  Other questions.  If she's not interested currently should I still pursue?  How should I go about it?  I feel just like telling her "Ms. R, we just spent the last 7 days together I found that the more time I spent with you the more I feel like I was falling in love with you."  Is that the right thing to say?  Is she ready to her that or should I play it slower, go a few times and *feel* it out.  I thought about posting a message to some website or at least something talking about falling for her since it is likely that she will end up reading it.  So will Ms. S and several of their friends though.  Does that matter?  Is that a good way?   I thought about writing her in e-mail but my current thinking is I 'd rather say something in person.  Which is why I sent that short message above and was disappointed by the reply.  I picture myself going to dinner, and maybe after dinner *popping* the question to the effect of "Lets be more than friends".  Then of course come all the other complications and over thoughts.  If it did happen, when would I get to meet her?  She lives with her parents, 50 minutes from me.  If I get a job in Japan I'll only have possibly friday nights and the weekends.  My fantasy dream is that we'd fall madly in love and nearly immediately move to SoCal.  Like that's gonna happen.  Why do I get so far ahead in my thinking?  Does everybody do that?  She told me she's decided she's going to get marrired next year.  It's one of those silly things people say and although I'm sure she hopes it will happen I'm pretty sure she wouldn't do it unless she found the right guy.  Then, she also said she wants to be the one to propose.  She wants to feel like "Yes! I did it!"  Of course you can guess where my mind went with that.  I'm also struggling with the whole Japan thing.  If she is not interested, will that make me lose all interest in being in Japan?  Before we spent the week together there was another woman at that office that I thought I should pursue.  Ms. M.  If Ms. R doesn't work out should I go for Ms. M?  Will I be perceived as a letch for trying for Ms. R and then trying for Ms. M.  They are friends or at least aquaintances.  Does this thinking about Ms. M mean I'm not really interested in Ms. R?  I was even massively attracted to the mater'd at a restaurant I went to yesterday.  So, from all that I start thinking about what makes Ms. S special.  She can illustrate.  She can do 3D.  She sings.  She's not picky.  She seems mostly easy going and not uptight at all.  She seems like she would be generally loving and caring and would enjoy someone that really loves and cares for her.  She seems like she could live abroad.  I'm actually writing this at the L.A. airport infront of the Daily Grill, waiting for my plane back to Tokyo.  I found that last night I was more excited than I can ever remember about going back and the chance to see her.  Then this morning I got the short reply and then was feeling somewhat opposite as in, well, if Ms. R is not interested maybe that should decide it.  I have 2 short weeks to find a job.  My goal/deadline is that if I don't find a job by Feb 1st I have to give my months notice to my landlord since I'm out of money.  I might be able to make that March 1st but I'm really cutting it close with my money.  At that point, all moving etc will have to go on my credit cards which.  I think I have 5k in Japan and 2K in America at this point.  I can get about 1k back from my apartment though I'll have no access to it since I won't get it until after I leave Japan and it will be put in my Japanese bank account.  Another thing that attracts me to Ms. R is that she seems more adventurous than me.  I see that as a huge plus because in my heart I want to be more adventurous but I don't want to do it without support.  If she was there by my side, hopefully that would help me to do those things.

      Strange.  I'm sleeping in the arms of my girlfriend and I was dreaming about my girlfriend from 4 years ago.  We were out for dinner and then afterward we were walking around a closed shopping center kind of place and we talked about a song I used to like and I went to go get it out of my car and it took me about 10 minutes and just as I was done she called and said she had already left.  I asked her if she was angry and she said no, I was going to ask her if I could come over but then I woke up.

       There is something about me that just wants to fuck and suck my brains out.  I guess supposedly that's not uncommon for a guy but lately it's been on my mind more than usual.  I don't know if it's too much porn or just longing for more sex because I haven't had enough or because I have had more than usual lately.  I saw Bio Hazard / Resident Evil tonight, not that that has much to do with sex although there is lots of nearly naked Milla in it and several flashback sex scenes.  But, as I was walking home I was thinking how Milla seems so unhesitant to get naked.  She was naked on her CD cover, naked in 5th element and a few other movies I guess and often naked or next to it in this movie.  Any, that got me thinking of things like   According to the media lots of people are sleeping around  According to *common sense* most people are in a relationship, hence having sex  I'm 37.  From 18 to 37 (19 years), there has only been sex in my life 3.75 years.  What the FUCK is wrong with me.  Why can I not just go out and get fucked.  It's not even just about sex it's about having someone to share your life with. Go out with, talk to, eat with, shower with, sleep with, travel with.   Many of my friends consider themselves in the shy side of the spectum.  And yet,  D has been with E for like 15+ years now. J has been with D since he was 22/23, that's 15+ years. G has been with S for at least 10. D has been with M for 10. E had J for 6 years, one year off, then S for 3 years now or is it 4.  I'm angry about it.  Then, I don't envy D or J.  G and S seem like a great match but I don't envy them.  But, I do envy S. K seems pretty awesome, she's smart and can use a computer.  J has Y who seems like a perfect match for him and very cool. Very nice, very loving, very smart, very talented and has very common interests.  Today I met D and F and F is super awesome.  A TOTAL gamer.  She has all the systems, a huge collection, plays all the PC games and is cute as hell.  I've got to get moving!!!!!!!  I've got to do something!!!!

      Because there are things I want to talk about that I'm not comfortable talking about non-anonymously.  I'll be honest, I'm not sure if this stuff should be discussed publicly or not.  Maybe this is what most people tell a counceller or something. Well see
