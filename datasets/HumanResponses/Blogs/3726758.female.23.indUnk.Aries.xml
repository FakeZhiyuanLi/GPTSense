      Thank God it's Friday.  Lindsay was up at 5 this morning, and refused to go back to sleep, so she has been up since.  I am very tired and have a headache.  When Tim comes home from work this morning, he thinks he is going right down for a 2-hour nap... haha.... no, I need to go get formula for Lindsay. 8:18 a.m. Friday

      Well, here I am, once again, up at a very early hour cuz Lindsay woke up and decided she was gonna be up for a while.  She was up at 4-something, so I changed her (she proceeded to pee all over the place, so I had to change her clothes and changing table cover), gave her a 4-oz. bottle and put her back to sleep.  She almost always goes back to sleep, but not this morning!  Luckily, I am pretty sure she has finally fallen asleep, cuz I don't hear her anymore, so I am gonna try and catch myself some zzzzz's. 5:25 a.m. Thursday   Here I am again, at 9:07 a.m., same day.  I am trying hard to baby proof this apt. cuz Lindsay is everywhere now that she is finally crawling.  She is also 10 months old today!  Where did the time go?  Anyways, she is in her crib right now complaining cuz she does NOT wanna nap, but she is tired, and I sure as heck don't wanna risk her getting overtired once again by keeping her up just cuz she doesn't wanna go to sleep.  Wish me luck.

      Once again, we are under a severe thunderstorm watch, and I think it's cool, as usual.  May was a real tough month where storms and tornadoes were concerned, but I do love storms.  By the way, I am going to post the time at the end of each post here cuz the one already posted at the end is wrong.   5:29 p.m.

      Dear Blog, This is my 1st Blog entry, and I must say, I am excited.  Let me tell you a little about myself.  My name is Amy, I am 23 and I am happily married to Tim, who is 34.  Together we have a 10-month-old daughter named Lindsay, and she is the absolute joy of our lives.  She arrived 5 weeks early via c-section due to the fact that I had extremely high blood pressure.  She weighed 5 lbs. 1 oz. and was 19" long, but perfectly healthy; didn't even have to go to the NICU like planned, which made us very happy.  I am a SAHM and Tim is a paramedic.  He is currently working in Kankakee.  We reside in Naperville, IL.  Right now Lindsay is being rather crabby, so I am going to end this entry now.  Bye!  June 23, 2004 8:39 a.m.
