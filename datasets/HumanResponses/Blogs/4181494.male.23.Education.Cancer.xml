      just got offered a full time position up in Sharon as an ABA teacher and I am now working in my field, full time and within an environment where everyday is a reward.   4 years of college and a year of subbing has paid off.

      You know those "billboards" that you sometimes see in front of restaurants and businesses that offer a quote or something catchy to draw you in? Well, on a trip through Dighton to get to Somerset, I came across such a "billboard" in front of a church that stated "The closer you live to God, the smaller everything else appears." This got my mind working, however, not in the sense the church probably wished it would. The closer to God, the smaller things seem to be...hmmmm... Let's assume God in this statement is the imaginary guy in the sky with the gray beard and white dress. What follows is my quirky sense of humor and semi-biting satire on religion:  The real reason priests take up the vow of celibacy. Why Jerry Falwell called Tinky Winky gay.  ("Antenna" envy) Why agnostics, pagans, etc. have great sex. Why Churches have phallic towers.  (Pointing up to God, my ass!) Why castration isn't much of a problem for religious fanatics.  (hello...is this thing on?)  and onto another bunch of idiots: the GOP  for those who think the same, please check out this article on Excite:  urlLink http://apnews.excite.com/article/20040808/D84B3AH80.html

       well let's start the blog with a rundown of what happened this past weekend.    For all those who weren't there here's what happened.  I was invited to a beach themed party at joe's place in new bedford.  I find out around midnight or so that my car was picked up and moved into the street by 7 teenage guys and towed thereafter.   After talking with a few officers at the station, the tow company, I had to shell out $95 yesterday for the tow just to get my car back.  As it turns out, I have a relative who has AAA and it looks like I can get a refund for the tow.     I'd like to give my thanks for all those who were there and helped:    Maura (taking the time and trying like hell with AAA and such), Joe (providing the couch and pullout bed), and Amanda    (for being sweet, putting up with me being goofy and for the excellent shoulder massage).  Even with the shit that went down with the car, the night turned out pretty decent.  I got to spend some time with Amanda, which was cool, even if we stayed up until 6 am.  Anyways, I had a full weekend with a nice surprise, some fun and except for the car thing, would live through it again in a heartbeat.  Thanks everyone for reading this and if I'm not lazy, there may be a couple more entries this week.
