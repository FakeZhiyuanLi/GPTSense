      As a single girl in her mid-twenties, I've come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as Mr. Right. I've grown up fortunate enough to have parents who are still married, and even better, still in love. This gave me the idea that my "other half," "partner," or "soulmate" was right around the corner, and that I'd find him and have one or more of his babies by the time I was twenty-five. Well, that birthday has come and gone, with no Mr. Right in sight. The funny thing is, even though I thought I'd miss him, I don't.  I had my "first love" when I was seventeen. We had our own language, picked out our children's names, and planned our entire future together before I even hit the dorms of University of Colorado. Needless to say, that relationship went south as soon as He discovered the joys of bleaching his hair and piercing his nipples. I've dated pretty regularly ever since, aside from the unfortunate drought of '01, but no one has really filled the shoes (or my mental checklist) of Mr. Right. Until recently, he's had to be at least six feet tall, a preppy dresser, and basically be anyone Mom and Dad would love to meet, let alone have me marry.  I was never a big risk taker in dating, preferring to spend my time with someone less interesting and dynamic than me, so I could be the one to "shine." The only prerequisite that hasn't changed is that he has to be funny and make me laugh until I pee my pants, but that's harder to come by than you might think.  Chicago is a big city full of eligible, and ineligible, men to date, which brings me not to Mr. Right, but Mr. Right-Now. All of my single girlfriends have been through this - dating, or decidedly not dating, someone they know isn't right for the long haul, but is "right" for "right now." Once you reach your twenties, romance becomes more of something you see in a Kate Hudson movie and less of something you actually experience firsthand. Instead, you pack yourself into a crowded sports bar on a Thursday evening, yelling to Mr. Right-Now over Def Leopard that you want to go home for the night, not have another Miller Lite.  I've recently acquired my own Mr. Right-Now, despite the groans and looks of concern from all of my friends. They think I'm crazy for spending time with someone who isn't my "type," and worry that I'll come away from the experience heartbroken and shattered. They say he's a "player," a "womanizer," a "bad person," and that if we were ever to get married (ha!), they wouldn't even show up for the ceremony.  Initially, these strong reactions garnered some attention and concern, until I realized that even if Mr. Right-Now was all these things, I didn't care. He's not 6'3", no dark brown hair, no penchant for Polo or a love of martinis (that I know of). Instead, he's blonde, has perma-stubble, lives in a white t-shirt, khaki shorts and flip flops, and drinks Guinness like it's water. He tries (somewhat unsucessfully) to boss me around, tells me his brutally honest opinion on everything from the conversation skills of my friends to the waistline of the girl at the next table, and somehow manages to steal my underwear and show it to his friends before giving it back to me in a public place.  He also thinks so highly of himself that he named his dog after part of his own name.  But, he makes me laugh until my side hurts, is more interesting than the last five guys I've dated combined, likes to make out as much as I do, even in my parents' apartment with my friends in the next room, and is more honest and forthcoming than any twenty-something male I know.  Instead if plying me with wine, a fancy dinner, or his knowlege of the latest art-house flick, he'll buy me a Jaeger bomb, tell me I have the best real boobs (he's seen a lot, real and fake) he's ever seen, then pull me into the men's bathroom at a bar to make out. Knowing him, he will probably get a huge ego boost from reading about himself on my blog, merely reaffirming his greatness, at least in his mind, but he's so without pretense, he'll just tell me he knew I'd end up writing about him, as "so many girls do."  Do I care? Nope. He's filling whatever needs that I have right now, which is why he's exactly that, Mr. Right-Now.   So, to all the single women out there sitting at home wondering why their date from Friday night hasn't called, it's because a girl like me has made them their Mr. Right-Now.  Go out and get one yourself - you don't know what you're missing.

      Friend went over to her fuck buddy's apartment last night to do some "stuff." Apparently the margaritas and beer we drank inspired her to come up with some new activities. #1, don't have sex, but let said fuck buddy "poke" you instead. And yes, it's exactly like it sounds. In-n-Out, but hold the fries. #2, walk out of buddy's room buck naked, and let his roommate see you naked. Talk about a wake up call! And yes, she's a Naked Person. It's always interesting to compare your  sexual  habits with that of Friend...
