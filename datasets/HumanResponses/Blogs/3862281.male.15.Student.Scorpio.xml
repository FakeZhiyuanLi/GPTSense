      I'd just like to say thankyou to  you , the reader.  I never thought that anyone would bother to read this blog yet people have commented on some of my previous posts and to know that I'm atleast reaching some people out there makes me feel a lot better.  I honestly think that putting forward everything I've ever kept inside onto this blog is doing me more good than the weeks of therapy I've already been through and I hope that this carries on until I can finally feel happy with my life again.  So thanks to anyone out there who's reading this, you couldn't possibly imagine how much you're helping.

      I looked over a few of my previous posts and I was astonished to find I had allowed the worst of all the people I've ever hated in my entire life to go free, so I'm bringing him back to tell the world how much of a bastard this person is.  Sean Jackson - Or 'traitorous bastard' as I like to call him (in my head ofcourse, as much as I would like a little revenge on these people, I  do  know what's legal and what's not so it's best all kept in my head).&nbsp; There was a time when I would have trusted this person, even thought of him as an actual friend, so much so in fact that I put my trust in him once and began the steady process of telling him my secrets.&nbsp; The worst mistake I'd ever made in my life.&nbsp; No sooner had I started to tell him the beginning of it all and the secrets that I'd kept from everyone than he began to blab them to others.&nbsp; My secrets aren't only my own, they're shared with many others I'm acquainted with and therefore when old Seany boy began his sly little hints about my secrets to others he was hinting about the secrets of not just me but many others.&nbsp; It's for this reason that  I  would be the one to be punished because of these secrets being let loose.&nbsp; Punished more dearly than I could have ever dreamed.&nbsp; Alyssa was killed because of this person who I once trusted.&nbsp; The murderer&nbsp;sleeps in prison now and I'm free to tell my secrets to the world but that's little comfort when the person I loved now&nbsp;sleeps in a grave.  So if you know this person, firstly I'd like to pity you for knowing such a down right low and selfish person and secondly I'd like to warn you never to trust him and never to so much as become a friend of his.&nbsp; He does not deserve it.&nbsp; It's all I can do to stop myself from killing him where he stands, I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye afterall.&nbsp; Any deranged psychopaths out there, I suggest you make Sean you're next target.&nbsp; Give him hell, it's only fair.

      I'm not the kind of person who really cares about wordly matters unless they directly influence myself, call me selfish but that's how I am.&nbsp; It's because of this that whenever the news comes onto the TV, I immediatly switch into day dream mode and ignore all that is being said.  Imagine my horrification when yesterday I actually bothered to give a damn and watch the news.&nbsp; A man is put in jail for slashing the kneck of his 10 month year old son, a teenager is sentenced to life imprisonment for stabbing a fellow school pupil in the heart, every&nbsp;day&nbsp;about&nbsp;30&nbsp;reports of animal abuse come into the RSPCA (it might only add up to just under 11000 reports a year but why should their be this minority at all?).  I'd heard of terrorist attacks, I'd heard of riots and rebellions but these things are done for the cause of religion and freedom.&nbsp; As bad as they are they have some sort of reasoning behind them.&nbsp; But where is the reasoning behind the headlines I heard yesterday?&nbsp; Why would anyone kill their 10 year old son?&nbsp; Why would a teenager stab an (as far as I know) innocent school pupil?&nbsp; Why be cruel to animals that have done nothing against you?  It makes no sense to me other than the people who commit these crimes have some sort of mental disease and they are incapable of thinking like&nbsp;normal people.  It makes me wonder if I was wrong.&nbsp; Perhaps the afterlife isn't hell for all.&nbsp; Perhaps we're already there.

      In reply to a recent comment I read on my previous 'Religious Idiots - pt 2'.  I apologise I hadn't (to be honest) bothered to check my facts about religion of Islam.&nbsp; But nevertheless it was only an example and the fact still stands that I don't agree with some religious teachings.  To attempt at another example, Christianity says in the 10 commandments 'thou shalt not kill' (perhaps not worded exactly the same, RE definitely isn't my best subject), obviously this kind of a rule  does  make sense but what about self defense?&nbsp; What if the only way you have to live is to kill someone else?&nbsp; What if you're a person who's lead a good life and it's either you or someone else who's lead a bad life that has to die?&nbsp; I can't think of example where this might happen in real life right now (kinda switched off at the moment) but perhaps something along the lines of a robbery or something?&nbsp; I hope you get my point anyways.

      Foolish teachings - There are many things in religion that just don't make any sense to me, I'm sure I'm not the only person who thinks that some things people practice are stupid.&nbsp; For example, take Islam, one of their teachings say that cohabitation (a couple living together without being married) shouldn't happen.&nbsp; It's because of this that most muslim's marriages are arranged marriages (or atleast I think that's the case, I should listen more in RE) and therefore how on Earth do the people get to know eachother before becoming married?&nbsp; Also, in Islam,&nbsp;divorce is frowned upon (I think, I am fairly sure about most of these facts being true in some sense I just might not be 100% accurate) therefore as soon as a couple becomes married they're basically stuck together, or face the embarrasment of getting a divorce.&nbsp; I have heard that the parents  do  usually pick good partners but still, there's always a chance that they might get it wrong and therefore damn their child to live their life with someone they utterly dispise or atleast mildly dislike.&nbsp; How can you manage to get to know somebody enough to marry them purely through dates and without living together for atleast a short period before actual marriage?  I do however try to keep an open mind and therefore if anyone reading this does know if there's actually any sensible reasoning behind this then please tell me because I'd really quite like to know.

      Mathew Barnstable - He's far too imature for his age, he allows old disputes he's had in his life to effect his actions.&nbsp; I know he remembers the times when I actively showed how much I hated him and displayed it constantly.&nbsp; I see him smile whenever I am hurt or when he attempts to inflict pain on me himself, unfortunately he doesn't (and never will) govern any power over me, making his efforts futile and worthless but nonetheless I see his attempts at hurting people, I listen as he insults his own 'friends' behind their backs, I see how he hasn't yet forgotten all the smallest things that have been done onto him.&nbsp; And for no reason too, he leads a full and relatively happy life as far as I've seen, it's always easy to see if anyone is truly hurt just by their eyes, the eyes always betray the mind, there's nothing behind his eyes but unreasonable malice and greed.&nbsp; He hides behind others to give him power, his mother (a formidable figure I assure you) has dealt out pain in his service many times before.&nbsp; He deserves to be told exactly what it is to suffer, he's deserving of death.

      Often do I find myself hating my family, they're no different than most families, my parents are a little odd and my 2 sisters are a little crazy but every family&nbsp;is unique.  The problem I have with my family is their constant assumption that I care, call me selfish but there is now only 1 person I truly care about, myself.&nbsp; People say they love their family but rarely is this true the people who say so only do out of mutual respect of sharing a similar genetic code with their family or for their parents bringing them into this world.  Well I thank my parents for bringing me into this world and respect the pain they went through for me to experience life but I find no reason to say stupid things like 'I love you' to them because of this.&nbsp; I also find sharing genes with my family as nothing special so still I harbour nothing other than mild respect towards my family.&nbsp; Yet they continue to think that my feelings go beyond this and that&nbsp;at some point I might actually say 'I love you' to one of them, I do not look at any member of my family and feel any signs of the greatest of emotions, I do not have incestual feelings and therefore I shall never say 'I love you' to any member of my family.  An example of this cruel assumption that my family has placed on my head is my mother, unfortunately she suffers from some kind of&nbsp;mild insanity (I believe it's cause is alcohol but I don't know the details of it all), it was because of this 'insanity' that my mother was taken away from where she lived and placed into the care of a hospital, upon my father's discovery of this he continued to tell me all about where she was and why etc and then ask me if I was alright.&nbsp; OFCOURSE I'M NOT ALRIGHT FOOL, I WAS ENJOYING&nbsp;A VIDEO GAME AND YOU COME IN AND MAKE SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM MINE!!!&nbsp; I would have said that but unfortunately that makes me sound inhuman because of all the years of families caring for eachother brainwashing my father into thinking that I would be the same and give a fucking damn, so therefore I have to feel uneasy as I act like I care, ask stupid questions like 'why'd they take her?' and then carry on to say that I'm alright.  Don't get me wrong, my family are alright sometimes, my sisters are always funny and my parents are so odd that they're quite funny too (an insane person and a hippy, what's not funny about that?), but I just wish that some day&nbsp;they'll realise I really wouldn't care if they died, they don't do my life any good in the first place, I could live by myself now (as much as they protest that I can't) and the most they do for me is make me laugh every now and then.&nbsp; I can't have a good conversation with them either because I've already surpassed their intellect, I&nbsp;remember asking my father many questions when I was young but rarely were they anything more complicated than 'how does a combustion engine work?' or something along those lines and I would usually get an answer that satisfied my curiosity, but now as my knowledge has grown I ask more complex questions like 'how does an object produce photons?' or 'what's string theory?' and I no longer get any answers that explain anything.&nbsp; I enjoy talking about and sharing knowledge with others but my family has no knowledge that interests me that I don't already know.  In short, my family are no use to me any more other than a laugh now and again and I hope one day they'll realise I don't&nbsp;think about them&nbsp;any more about them than the grass I walk over every month to visit Alyssa's grave.

      Regularly do I sit and contemplate many aspects about the universe around us.&nbsp; This rarely does little for me other than allow me to put thoughts in order and perhaps draw lines between knowledge to understand things more.  One thing has come to me recently though, a small thought that is certainly true for myself and maybe true for others.   Emotions are like energy.  In the way that as an object gains energy, the object looks for ways to release that energy (e.g. heat, movement and in excess amounts of energy, explosion).&nbsp; It's in this way that the mind does the same thing with emotion.&nbsp; As a person experiences emotion they must find outlets for it.&nbsp; For example, as a person feels angry they must unleash that anger in some way (e.g. hurting somebody).  However certain emotions seem easier to release than others.&nbsp; Like happiness, all that is needed is to laugh, transfer of energy/emotion can be seen in happiness too for when you see one person laugh you often see others join in.  Emotions can be released in many forms too but each emotion seems to have it's own signature outlets, love for instance can be outletted by kissing, hugging, making love, etc, whereas anger is usually outletted by shouting, giving pain, etc.  Unfortunately, as with energy, as more emotions are experienced or kept contained then more outlets are needed until eventually so much emotion/energy is stored that a mental disastor occurs, fortunately I haven't experienced this and the metaphorical equivalent to an energy induced explosion might be different in the emotional terms, for instance, it might be something along the lines of self destruction therefore something like suicide?  Is this true for you?&nbsp; It would interest me to find out if this 'theory' applies to others than myself.  What are my emotional outlets?&nbsp; Video games, I release my emotions in imaginary worlds on imaginary people because the only real person I could freely express emotion towards has died and now I hide myself from the world behind warped versions of reality.&nbsp; But I fear this isn't enough,&nbsp;I've&nbsp;felt my mental condition declining for some time now, I'm afraid this is because I have to much pent up emotion that I can no longer express how I used to.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I some day face the destruction that my theory predicts?&nbsp; What does this 'destruction' involve?&nbsp; Can I avoid it?&nbsp; Where can I find other outlets?  I've had answers to these questions but none were welcome, I'm travelling&nbsp;along the road to a better life but for now I'm lost and need to find a new route.

      Leighann Johns - Every time someone does something particularly cruel to me she always seems to instantly take my side and assume that I want her damned sympathy.&nbsp; If I wanted sympathy then I would be more forward with my emotions and tell everyone  exactly  how I feel.&nbsp; Ofcourse she doesn't know any of this and so I shouldn't really blame her but I hate it when people assume things so quickly.&nbsp; Worst of about her I think I've find myself being attracted to her, ofcourse I could never like her like I did Alyssa, I'd never allow myself but nevertheless I'm still human and I can't help but look at her no matter how much I know I betray my heart by doing so.

      I never thought that I'd not look forward to the school holidays...ever.&nbsp; Yet here I am, knee deep in fear and depression about the holidays that have appeared so suddenly on my doorstep.  Why am I worried about the school holidays?&nbsp; I hate being alone.&nbsp; Rarely do I ever leave my house (usually I only do so to go to school or to buy necessary things like clothes and food).&nbsp; I prefer to stay at home and play video games non-stop, call me a fool but that would be a matter of opinion and if that is your opinion I must say that you are the fool for being so closed minded about your thoughts.  These holidays will be my first without Alyssa as she died after the last holidays I had and therefore the only company I'll have is my ignorant father and any of my 'friends' who actually think I like them.&nbsp; There is no-one left on Earth that I know in real life that I can truthfully say I like.&nbsp; There're people I know over the internet that I like however yet I only like them because they seem to like me, and they only like me because I'm able to make up my own life to tell them, the only people who know the real me over the internet are the people reading this (if anybody).  And so the holidays are already upon me and I must face 5 weeks by myself with only virtual reality to entertain me, the hardest part is remembering why I carry on and why I shouldn't end it now, I could never let that happen, I promised Alyssa I wouldn't.

      A poem about my beliefs on death and the afterlife.   Endless Hell  by George Clarke   slowly into his arms  all fears gone  all wishes said  he embraces you  takes you forward  on and on you tread   go to the next  moving onward  he smiles so friendly  gates are in sight  gestured through  welcomed so gently   a liar you see  you now know  destroyed your trust  nowhere now  you look around  you walk on as you must   no turning back  no going back  the doors now closed tight  no surrender  no mercy  all you have&nbsp;now is to&nbsp;fight   you regret  try to forget  as you walk out from the door  you fear  don't wish  as you enter the eternal war   &nbsp;  Just a quick explanation on that poem, a lot of the thinking of my beliefs are very complicated and I won't go into them in one post alone but few things to help understand the poem - I believe that when you die you're greeted by death, I don't try to give death a form he is merely something that greets you, he greets you friendly explains you're dead and leads you to the afterlife, he shows you the doors and tells you to walk through and when you do they close behind you, you look out onto the worlds of Hell, the last destination of everybody, whether they've been good or bad, everyone goes to Hell, you're soul is torn and warped by the lands of Hell and you become a warrior, created and designed purely to fight, a being of evil, you enter the war of souls, every person in every universe who has died comes here and they are forced to fight, thoughts flood your mind and your body betrays you as it runs into the fray, you die again in seconds, you appear outside of the gate again staring out at Hell again, you notice the other souls leaving the gates that litter the land, endless floods of crazed demons rushing into war, you follow, you have no choice, you fight for eternity.   I won't go into why or how I came to believe this, like I said my beliefs have very complex elements in them and would take a lot of explaining to understand.   Anyone who feels suicidal and is reading this, see this as my argument for why you should live, unless you fully believe the next life is better than the one you currently live you should avoid death at all costs.&nbsp; There is nothing to say what happens in the afterlife, you cannot be assured that it'll be heaven that waits for you, perhaps an endless war or a place of torture awaits instead.    Think about the consequences of your actions.    Me and Alyssa shared the same beliefs, that is why I cry for her.&nbsp; But one day I know that we will fight together and we will be stronger next time.&nbsp; She knows to delay death until I'm by her side again, and then we will fight him.&nbsp; We put a challenge towards god for letting Hell happen, if&nbsp;it denys us then we shall lead others against it.&nbsp; She died because of these beliefs and I won't let her death be in vain.

      I've been looking over my previous posts and I think an explanation is in order as to why I am friends with people I entirely despise.   Simple answer, I am friends with them purely because nobody else likes me.&nbsp; That might sound a little hard on myself but I think it's true.&nbsp; I can honestly say that I think most people dislike me or atleast derive some pleasure in causing me pain.&nbsp; Hell, I have the bruises to proove it, it's almost a shame that mental scars aren't as apparent, if they showed as well as my physical wounds then maybe I could do something about it.&nbsp; You learn to forget about it more quickly as time passes though so I guess I don't mind any more.   Something I saw on a forumn that stuck in my mind.   'it's only a matter of time before a vase breaks'   I'd like to think I would but I don't think of myself as a stupid person and I'm not into being blamed for something that I was not the catalyst of.

      I've decided I'm going to make a second running post. This time it's about why I hate the religious.   Sexism - Pretty simple reason this, correct me if I'm wrong here but a few religions I've looked into seem to have sexism in their teachings, for example, in the bible who is it that causes original sin? Eve! A woman! And the man merely gets dragged along in the whole affair. Now if that isn't sexism then I obviously deserve to be&nbsp;burnt at the stake. Makes me wonder why nuns exist. If I was a woman I definitely wouldn't be christian if I could help it.

      I thought I'd start a running post about who my so called 'friends' are and why I hate them so much. I'll post a 'friend' and the reason why I hate them every now and then.  I'm starting of with 2 'friends' just because I want to.   Sean Jackson - The reason Alyssa died. I'm not really willing to say any more about this one but regardless he is the 'friend' I hate the most.  Bradley Moogan - He attempted or atleast threatened to commit suicide once. I hate anyone who's suicidal particulary because it shows their stupidity and the fact that they have a religious belief of some sort. 1) Because who the fuck says the next life is any better? Oh, ofcourse, the fucking religious do. 2) HE WAS FUCKING GOING TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW, THE DUMB SHIT! That has to be the stupidest way to commit suicide. What if he landed on his feet (judging by the window he probably would have)? I'll tell you what would have happened if he did land on his feet shall I? Upon impact his leg bones would undoubtedly break and his upper leg would face a direct impact on the ground which would then force his upper leg bones up through his hip bone and into his stomach area, causing intense pain, internal bleeding, damage to organs and a hell of a lot more. And the only quick death resulting from this would be if the lungs, heart or brain are damaged so therefore the fucking idiot would suffer unbearable pain and agony until he died from blood loss or somebody injected him with one hell of an anesthetic.

      A poem, in memory of Alyssa Mariners. Just so you know the words spoken is the title, they were her last words.            Don't Forget Me                      By George Clarke  Fingers releasing from tender grips Words spoken by dying lips  Never can Never will Won't allow this Space to fill  Realisation comes and I start crying Tears begin to fall as you lay dying  Always loved Always envied Shot in the back By lying greed  I scream for help, mind begins to panic Blood flows away. So quick. So quick  Holding love Holding close Thinking thoughts Of who I'll miss the most  Help comes quick, as the blood runs cold "She'll be fine," or so I'm told  Thoughts flow Thoughts die Only now to think Only now to try  I'll hold our thoughts, our beliefs still true But for now all I can think, is how I'll miss you

      My first introduction kind of post and be prepared to be as depressed as I can possibly make you with my meaningless ramblings about a crappy life.  This is a place where I feel fairly safe, away from the constant mocking and ridicule that would undoubtably follow was I to allow my so called 'friends' to read this.  It is for this reason that this is the one and only place where I will  ever  allow my personal feelings to be told to the world. Just goes to show my complete stupidity how I could have easily kept my profile anonymous.  But on contemplation on this matter I've come to realise how much I would  really  like my 'friends' to know how much I hate each and every one of them.  So much so, in some cases that I would gladly kill them if given the chance.  It is things like the above that I will post here and here only.  I doubt any of my friends will ever find this website and if they do, who cares?  It's the truth after all.  Just a word of warning, you may find some of my ideas and opinions unusual or insulting, if so don't bother complaining to me because I don't care.  Another warning for the religious out there who may be reading, I advise you read no further, lest you find out how much of an idiot I think you are.  Expect poetry, ramblings and down right angry ranting about anything that concerns me but I can't speak my mind about to anyone other than you the reader.

      I'm bored a lot lately and am looking for things to do. Hell, I spent 2 hours listening to music played at different speeds, it's not a good thing to know that Coldplay at twice the speed is the funniest thing since Tenacious D (best band ever). Anywayz, got bored listening to music at funny speeds and I decided to edit one of my pictures and I thought I'd share it, so here it is...     ...yeah, ok, it's stupid but I was really bored alright?! I was kinda going for a robot kinda thing but I ended up goofing it up.  And no smarmy comments like 'What's changed?'.

      Summer holidays and the boredom has already gotten to me.  I have absolutely and I mean ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY nothing to do and it's pissing me right off.  If you're not getting how serious a problem this is, I'll point out that I'm nearly always content to sit down and play through a game I've already completely a billion times. YES!! EVEN THE PLAYSTATION VERSION OF SPACE INVADERS!!!!  I've never suffered from this problem before!  I've never had nothing to do for so long!  For as long as I can remember I always had 2 options if I ran out of ideas either  1) hang out with Alyssa or 2) play a video game  but I've already lost one of those options and so I'm stuck with video games, sure I can't get enough games EVER!  Hell, I love them almost as much as I do Alyssa, but FOR FUCK SAKE!! THERE'S ONLY SO FUCKING MUCH I CAN STAND!!!! and only 3 days before I go on holiday too! fucking hurry up Monday all fucking ready

      Just a quick notice to say that I won't be able to post from 9th - 16th(ish) of July, because I'm going on holiday and won't have access to a computer am going to Alton Towers afterwards so I probably won't post then either. Can't wait actually, am going to Jersey to stay with my sister (Lorie) for a week and get some much needed sun, was a blast last time I went so am looking forward to it. Went to Alton Towers before too, quite recently in fact (the Wednesday before last I think, give or take a week) but my other sister (Frances) is coming back to England with me and she wants to go to Alton Towers again so I'm tagging along. So this holiday is looking to be one of the righteous times of my life (big woo for me) and I say a 'temporary sayonara'     to the small group of people who actually read this blog (judging from the different names in e-mails and comments and things I'm up to a grand total of 7 readers! >_   to everyone else just because I feel like it!  Hah, my first go at pictures in a post, think it turned out alright don't you?  Apart from the pictures ofcourse, I'm not exactly a master photographer.  Isn't techonology wonderful?  I can swear at people across the world without leaving my seat!

      Just thought I'd apologise for not posting a lot recently. Reason being that I only ever post about things that randomly pop in my head in the short periods that I'm not day dreaming or reminiscing over old memories and I tend to only be depressed at these times. Fortunately, I haven't felt very depressed lately, hell, I feel great at the moment (just completed Devil May Cry on 'Dante Must Die' mode...jebus that was hard, I'm not even very good at that game in the first place), therefore I haven't really thought about anything worth posting lately, unless ofcourse saving the world from a giant meteor which was sent by god and then single handedly wiping all human life of the face of the Earth interests you (day dreaming's fun). hmmmm... Well actually that does sound quite interesting, to me atleast. Might make a post about a random day dream I have on a later date then. Ah well, just thought I'd say this so that you don't think I've forgotten all about my quaint little blog of depressing stuff. AAAARGH!!!! I'm making jokes!!!! On my blog of depressing stuff!!!! What is wrong with me?! *explodes* ... Did I just write that? Ok,  now  I think I need therapy. I think I'd best leave before the sarcasm kicks in. Like that would ever happen! DAMNIT!!!
