      Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.  Teach a man to fish and he will sit in a boat drinking beer all day.  Teach a man to manufacture beer  and he will contest for loksabha elections against Vijay Mallya.

      Do you believe in Astrology ?? If you ask me the same question, then I will say "Yes I do, to some extent".   When I was in Bangalore, during my college days.  One day on of my family friends who had a fair knowledge of Astrology said to me, "You will go towards east to work when everyone will fly towards west."  Then I was dreaming about going to Singapore, Japan, Australia.. etc.. etc..   After completing my graduation, I got a job and traveled due east not to Japan or Singapore, but to Chennai. :-) That's why I said I believe in Astrology to some extent.. ;-)

      If something is so complicated that you can't explain it in 10 seconds, then it's probably not worth knowing anyway.

      Never argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level, and then beat you with experience.
