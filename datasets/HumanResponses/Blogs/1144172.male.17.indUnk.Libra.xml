      Hmm well today at school I cleared the house in both games of Poker we played.  No one else would play grid-lock though....  On a lighter note, quiet man Luke was going on about Whale dicks being 12 foot long and basically told the whole room 10 times, oh and also we were informed they have 1 ton balls.  Back to Gridlock, the gambling rules will be up soon when me and Phil think of them and make sure they work well. Have fun with the images of whales you now have in your head...

      oooh yeah, card values...  Cards 2-10           =  2-10 respectively. Ace                     =  11 Jack/Queen/King  =  10  suits have no values, although sometimes i want to throttle Dave for saying Hearts > Spades, when surely Spades > Hearts > j00.  >_  -Phil out.  ps Dave is a f00l

      so in a nutshell:  •Freeflow(24) is the best thing to get, although... •Abdul(6) beats Freeflow. •Petroc(33) beats Abdul, as long as nobody has Freeflow. •Gridlock(Even sum) is an automatic loss, but only on a three card combo (so someone can win on lets say, 18, with two cards). •Anti-Gridlock[unconfirmed name](Odd sum) with all players means the highest value holder wins.  some other day i will post extra rules for betting on Gridlock, but for now, i'm revising for my Stats exam tomorrow (*coughbullshitcough*)  >.>    -Phil out.

      "indeed i am." said the pig....  i'm bored in a free period and i'm stuck next to some wierd girl, who hates me. but now she doesn't O.o so now i am going to post the rules to gridlock™.  Rule 1. You do not talk about gridlock. Rule 2. You  DO NOT   talk about gridlock....  wait a minute, that's fight club... ok.. 1. Each player starts off with 2 cards. 2. Start off left of the dealer. 3. Each player adds up the value of thier cards. 4. The players request to take one card from the dealer, and only one. 5. If the sum of the three cards is an even number, the player gets gridlock and has automatically lost. 6. If the sum of the three cards is an odd number, the player is still in the game. 7. If the sum of the three cards totals up to 24, the player gets Freeflow and has the best chance of winning. 8. If the sum of the three cards is 6 (three 2's), the player gets Abdul, and can beat a Freeflow. 9. If the sum of the three cards is 33 (three Aces), the player gets Petroc, but cannot beat an Freeflow for some reason :-/  10. If everyone has an odd number sum of their cards, the player with the highest value wins. 11. It is optional for a player to choose if he wants a card or not, so you can still win on a 2-card combo... 12. Abdul can only win if another player has a freeflow- then Abdul wins outright, if no one has a freeflow Abdul counts as a pathetic score of 6.  that's about all that needs to be covered about the game.  Credit goes to Sam Allaby for coming up with the name Freeflow. everything else is mine and Grant's work.  -Phil out.

      Hi, welcome to the site of the card game Gridlock. If you take the time to read through the posts you will be able to discover the magical world of gambling on gridlock games!  In a few days after my maths exam I will be posting some rules for the game, and Phil might add his personal touch.

Grant's GridLock game is such a n00bish effort compared to mine. i'm already on version 1.4 with amazing money green background  ...  i finally scrapped the pascal program, it had no destiny anyway (maybe it should've checked "ph8" to see what was to happen...)  My girlfriend rocks. Grant is fat. Pasta grows on trees. And i make one hell of a Tikka Masala.  Fare thee well, and keep on gridlockin'  -Phil out.

      " suffered a 20% dignity reduction, but i'll survive.... or will i? " quote from Phil, the answer to it is..... |no|  Back to reality then, it seems at school now whenever gridlock is mentioned after a stale game of pontoon everyone gets really excited.  So if you are ever bored in a game of cards break out the box of gridlock and your evening/lunch will be rejuvinated.  We still haven't played for money though.... which shows the game is good enough without gambling ;o()

      By the way if you are idiotic enough to follow Si's link and not a high class link over to the left then you are a fool for starters.   Secondly anything that happens to your computer or life due to clicking his link is in no way related to Karrde.co.uk or any of its employees (Si is just a guy who comes and posts stuff for free but isn't actually connected to us).

      First Sue Earle Post!  Back to the point of this post: Sue Earle lost her magical farm to the horrors of the malicious sea along the East coast of Britain.  This was fully due to the evil council of Mappleton building a controversial groyne just before Sue's farm.  This abomination stopped the vital process of Longshore Drift which replenished the beach in front of the cliff edge that Sue Earle lived on.  With the groyne in place the beach was never seen again as it was quickly washed away.    Without a beach the cliffs were constantly barraged by powerful waves, the hydraulic action blasting apart the weak rocks.  So Sue was forced to demolish her dear dairy and with it her soul.....  Now her farm is no more and the people of the region rejoice - or do they?  If they had known what the groyne to protect there town had caused would they have allowed it?  In a word  yes .  Oh well worth a try, and thanks to Sue Earle  Hero of Poynton High Geography Group ™

Thirdly, James is beavering away in his cave to try and get us a web site, bless his heart. and last but on means least, i plan to develop a v2 website, with all the eye candy goodness that will make u melt.  Yummy.   Oh, i almost forgot, Simon is a complete random, he does nothing. From now on, hes called Mr. Idle. or somethin. whatever....  ~fin~

      muhahahahhaha... I must have damn big pockets, as i appear to have you in them! Any how, grant and phil are making good progress on there respective gridlock e-games, i think. Havnt seen much yet, though. Also, grant did say he was lining up a better website thats stand alone with better features. Nothing of this sort from his grotty cave recently. Who knows. I have yet to find out why this Simon dude is floating about, i ought to ask him, but hes usually to busy drinking coke from bottles with a lolly in his mouth... at the same time?! the mind boggles (or bloggles, if you prefer a slice of pun pie.) Just realised i have Computing Coursework due in Monday. Off to work then i suppose...  ...No rest for the wicked.

      Hi Si.  P.S - The clan message only speaks the truth, unfortunatly for you. Now your secrets out, i cant sell it to the press and get bags of money. how annoying.   urlLink http://206.98.167.99:8006 . Open this in winamp (or media player, whatever). its a very good feed for trance music, if u like that kinda thang!  stop.  "Just throw the shovel away, man..."

BTW, paranormaldeathmatch.com is a good romp if your sat at your PC with glazed over eyes, and a completely blank mind (like mine 99% of the time). stimulating.

I did manage to get a Japanese Studies guide from a quality stall with people dressed in traditional Japanese clothing. Oh and if yo have a Thames Valley prospectus then look at the very back page for a really cool picture!

      Well the joke is on Phil this week, or should I say   S01   as he likes to be called.  Yes that is right if you search for "philcj14" (phils email address) on Google as I did out of boredom you will be pleasantly suprised to find a site for the Mighty -Fart Division-, what is this you may ask?  Well I am not going to tell you, but all I will say is that it is a site made for Phil by a lower ranking fart official of his.  This site is desgined to coordinate the efforts of Fart in Destroying and Dispanding any flamers or other such mischief causers on his beloved Perfect Dark Social board.  So basically look at it and  laugh  - at Phil - though don't be to harsh  it is old and only a joke  - at least according to the O' Greasy One.

The cool stuff on it are ripped off other free sites. The actual site is pretty shit really. 3. Do you have quicktime installed on ur p.c?... This is probably why the vidio doesnt work. (Maybe). 4. I dont know java, dont have time to learn/ cant be arsed learning. 5. Maybe you have a point.  Do you want me to get rid of the forum then?  -=Si=-

Oh and that Windows thing won't work for me either, though the particle thing is cool - although another rip off, make your own damn special effects java thingy.

      Si! How did your site get more hits than this one?  I mean we are the ones that get you all the publicity and this is how you repay us..  Well I suppose I did say yesterday this would happen and hopefully some of your extreme luck will rub off on us.  And people only go to your site to play stretch Bush and Saddam we have actual quality content if only the archives were accesible.  Oh and one more thing Si, don't post in damn big fonts it looks crappy and pretty script kiddieish - especially the "!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  thanks  (my very poor xtm site has had 629 views ;p)

And what happened that you fixed Gid, oh well main thing is it is all working at the moment and that hopefully Si's site is getting loads of traffic to come our way.  Better get ready to pay additional bandwidth charge :|  Oh yeah the geography trip was good, infinatly better than the Birmingham open day trip.  We had lunch at 10.40 and then again at 13.00, yay!  All I can say is I wasn't hungry when I got home (though Phil still would have been, and Gid will have been even though he had 2 chesseburgers and a bigmac).

At least I have made a vodoo doll of Largo LaGrande, and his Largo Embargo has ended, but shit he managed to grab LeChuck's beard off me.  Well I'll let it pass for now but I am sure there will be consequences for my worrying lack of care in the future but hey, who really wants to chase after a short stumpy pirate for a dead guys still living beard?  Oh and Si stop being off school even if you are the master of all things yellow.

I dont think its an official vidio or anthing so its a bit dodgy. I will bring it in tomorrow. I cant find a Deus Ex 2 video- i dont think there is one yet.  Oh, and 'everyone else'?? its only you, me and phil that post here anymore. But anyway $9 for a Tshirt! wow that is cheap. I have sent off for 5 of them. (Joking) *laughter*  In other news, I fixed my computer so now I dont have to use my other crappy computer in a really uncomfortable position.

      Wow a landmark in hotmail history, I was away for one whole week and when I came back to delete all my emails....  I found I only had 89 and I wasn't even at the account size limit, no I was only 75%!  That is bloody marvelous seeing as over the past month I was at 100% every night.  Hmmm and yahoo which usually doesn't have much junk has given me 42 spam messages.  Shame really I was let down by my Outlook address which isn't even signed up to much, it had 210 spam messages so my dad was fairly happy when combined with my brother we left 450 messages in the public inbox.

As for me, I've been addicted to playing PS2 and watching Family Guy season 3 on teh DVD. Go to  urlLink www.play.com  to buy it for just £17.99. That's £5 cheaper in shops, and with free delivery too. You only need a Solo card too...  Sha-zay-um  -Phil out.

Anybody have 10 grand (or a car) to lend us?  You should watch The Matrix Reloaded, I think is is one of the best sequals ever.  I havent seen Bad Taste though.

      Hoho Phil, where did you see Bad Taste!?  It is a comedy classic though is it not...  The only joke I don't like is at the end when Derek goes 'I've been reborn' or something to that effect.  The start is amazing where that alien gets his axe stuck on the wall and then when they use another alien to ram down the door.  All that comedy genius by the Lord Of The Rings director, and the special effects, and most of the acting.  I haven't seen Matrix Reloaded yet and probaly won't but what the hell, might still have to wath Revolutions when it comes out just to get totally confused.

      Grant you fucking noob. If you actually looked at the template, you could've changed the background back to its original colour which was right below the &lt;img src=""&gt;, I hid it in the &lt;!-- --&gt;. Not that it matters anymore ¬_¬.  I guess some day I'll use my leet HTML skills and fix it as it was.  Anywho, Wendel, I got a C in comp and U's in Physics and Maths. I was 5 marks off an E for Physics, and 3 marks off an E in Maths. I can carry on Physics, but not Maths, so i'm going to have to take shitty Psychology or something.

      Firstly Phil, this new template is fucking terrible. Secondly, the side pot is worked out when a player goes all in, and more than 1 person calls it.  Then the side pot consists of the people who can still bet (so not the person who is all in).  So all the money involved in the all in call go into the main pot, the additional bets afterwards go into the side pot.  This is why the side pot was so big, the fools had nothing but wouldn't fold and so kept raising.  You won what all the bets and the calls up to your all in though because you couldn't carry on betting any more money put in couldn't be won by you.  Anyway probaly explained that a few times over there - don't change the template to this kind of shit again please, as I can't get the good template back now and have to use a pretty poor but not quite as bad as your choice one :|

      Phil I have to say you would have been a fool to raise up when it is like that, you did the right thing.  And those guys who split the pot will find that most of the money they won was the money they put in.    Either those idiots were really good at reading their opponents or they just were really crap at bluffing.  When they had a total bluff they one should have just gone all in and then the other bluffer would know that hands would be shown if he called, so would fold - unless he is an even bigger idiot.   Oh congrats on completing transport tycoon! ;o0

      Hew Sam, how's it going? Will you be joining us for school again?  I've managed to complete Transport Tycoon DX with a company value of over £70m (I was making around £3m a year) and the only competition was a rival company which was making around 100k a year :-/.  It took me practically the whole summer to get through the 100 years of it, and now that I've beaten it, I'm starting to play some more online poker.  Yesterday I managed to win $3000 over two consecutive hands....  And today, fate played a cruel trick on the table:    Many of the players and I folded before the river card was drawn because everyone was betting a lot of money. I thought someone had 4 of a kind so I didn't play on anymore. Turned out that the two remaining people shared the $5000 pot with the full house :-/.  Nothing else to report.  -Phil out.

      The only complaints I have so far is if you're an impatient sort then you might get bored in the game's current state. The immediately accessable content is limited because they rushed the release somewhat, but if you're patient and are willing to go in search of fun then it's probably the most fun you'll have ever had in a game. Getting in a group of 12 fellow Rebels and using teamwork to take down an AT-ST is unbelievable.   My character is a Zabrak (Darth Maul type) marksman. I'm very nearly qualified for Bounty Hunter though, which will be nice.  You can't have vehicles or ships, yet. This is more evidence of the rushed release. Vehicles (Speeders, bikes, etc.) will be added within a few months, and space ships (X-Wings, Tie-Fighters)(w00t w00t) will be added sometime next year. Which is understandable considering they have to create the space in which they'll fly. You'll also be able to ride creatures soon enough.

      Yeah, it's not out in the UK yet. I imported it from America becasuse some guys I know play it. So I thought I may as well give it a try. There is a monthly fee, which is a shame, but I'm loving it so far so I have no complaints.

      Phil! If you want a lift in tomorrow phone me before 10am, I know it won't happen but at least I tried.    Nice to hear from you same, and you have Star Wars Galaxies?  Didn't think it was out yet and do you have to pay a monthly fee? Good luck tomorrow guys not that any of you need it...

      I'm alive! Just. It was touch and go there for a while though...  I would post more but I've been kidnapped by Star War Galaxies. It won't let me go no matter what I try.  Meh.  I got 537.3 kilobits per second on that test. It said "Compared to all connection types worldwide, yours is fantastic". w00t!  I'm going to see T3 sometime this week. It can never live up to T1 or T2 but I'm still looking forward to it.

      Saw T3 today, not a bad film at all - some very good car chases and lots of destruction.  For a 12 some pretty nasty scenes as well, highly recommended. Ooh and I am buying some poker chips, although all the damn websites charge 5 quid delivery so I am still looking for a good site.    Please click that damn link and sign up it is lots of fun and free!

We were playing 7 card stud poker and I thought I had won it with a nice nut straight, 10, jack, queen, king of diamonds and an ace of clubs.  Then I looked down at my hand and discovered another ace - of diamonds!  A royal flush - yay.    As a side note, I won that hand and a great deal of paper money.

I was just looking around the net for a while and i found a site that claims that all 'fruit-machines' are actually fraud! Confused, i read on... They claim that if you download  urlLink this  emulator and  urlLink this  ROM you will find that you cant actually win the £250 jackpot that they claim. And they claim it does the same with every emulated fruit machine they have tested.  Click  urlLink here  to find out more about how to prove this fruity swindle.  Oh yeah, I checked an old e-mail account that I don't use any more... I found that it had an incredable 1317 e-mails...  All spam    -=Si=-

      I downloaded it from Kazaa. It took me a tedious fortnight to get it (with speeds fluctuating between 0.08kbps and 4.87kbps), but it's definately worth it.  I also made  urlLink another pic.  It's some UFOs. Took a good 3600.4 seconds to render fully, but that's with everything on high detail and with the UFOs being slightly transparent (you can see a little through the tops of them if you look hard enough), so that increases render time quite a bit.   Also, I have my shitty 750MhZ processor to blame.  *boots computer* *also boots shitty 56k modem for the hell of it*  Granty, when is ADSL coming to Disley?

The hackers only managed to steal 1/3 of the unfinnished code apparently. It's certainly tempting, but I'd rather wait for the full version. Nice screens though! :D

      Yesssss, I am the programming god. I have made the most irritating (and ultimately pointless) program ever. When you shut it down, It makes three more in a random possition. You can't even use Ctrl-Alt-Delete! The only way to get rid of it is to resart. Its got flashing colours and everything. Muahahaha.  Nice one Shelr for passing.  If you made that aurura pic of yours phil into a usefull size (1024 by 768 or something) it would make a pretty cool wallpaper  -=Si=-

      Si....   That is possibly the wankest post I have ever had the displeasure of reading to be completely fair.   Why do you assume that the reindeer can only pull ten times the normal - I mean surely if they can fly then they can probaly pull an infite amount, would make more sense.  The 600,000 tons at that speed would only create a lot of air resistance if the sleigh was badly designed (by you I would guess), otherwise I am sure it could be made extremly streamlined and so wouldn't create much drag though even if it does it is clearly lined by many ceramic tiles.  Oh yeah better mention that in other countries such as Holland this festive trip of joy is made on a night prior to Christmas, so I think that explains any "evidence" that it is impossible.  (please type the post yourself next time :p)

      Heheh, this outa ruin Christmas for ya....   There are approximately two billion children (persons under 18) in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming that there is at least one good child in each.  Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second.  This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get on to the next house.  Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks.  This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second--3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element.  Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that the "flying" reindeer could pull ten times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them... Santa would need 360,000 of them.  This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). 600,000 tons traveling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance. This would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake.  The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.   -=Si=-

      Hey Kirby, I have a full copy of Photoshop on CD if you want it (and I'm guessing you do). I've only used it to create some  urlLink flame logos . But other than that it's pretty much useless to me.... :-/  When anyone next plays on CS play on these following maps: as_crazytank2 as_crazytank3 ka_roadwars_v2 ka_roadwars_v3 climb gijoecars megacrazycar supercrazycars2 supercrazycars3  Those are pretty much all I play on these days...  Nothing else to report.  -Phil out.

      The  urlLink latest pic  from Photoshop looks pretty cool. I submitted it to the digital blasphemy user gallery. It probably won't get in tho.  In other news, it turns out that i only need DDE to get into staffordshire with my current AS grades. So I should be able to make it. Wahay!  *Kirby dances*  -=Si=-

      That's err.. Great Phil You must have been really bored.

So now I have really wrinkly fingers, my jeans and shoes are soaked... But hey! My mum got her car washed for free.  Also, i just spent 20 mins trying to find out what was wrong with our linux server, only to find that my dad had stolen the extension lead for the NTL box. Gnargh x2  And to top it all off, my mum and dad are away all of sunday, so i have to cook for myself. Again. Gnargh x3  I really want to go to uni. Now.  Rant over.  -=Si=-

      Woop, my CS map is coming along fine.  I have the tech block, 6th form block, language department, the shelter thingy, and the library/canteen block. It just needs touching up for scale.  There's also a Shellhorse fully working with top acceleration, speed, and damage.  All that's left is to make a Maximini (Maxwell's mini) and the rest of the school with proper textures...  -Phil out.

      Ok Roadtrip meeting / Poker night is confirmed...  Friday the 30th, at 8 p.m  Sheldon is picking up Kirby :p. So would be good if deaks could take greeny and owen.  Remember to have gathered some info for the meeting. We actually need to get some things organised.

      2nd Roadtrip meeting. I think everyone is in charge of summit.  AM - Finance / Costs RD - What we are doing / beer RK - The details of the route DG - Camp sites. SD - Camping equipment JO - Food and other logistics PJ - Open JG - Open  Ok the next roadtrip meeting could be in the form of a poker night at Phils. Possibly Friday night. I'm gonna ask John and Greeny today. I think that also it might be the last time for a while that we are all here.  Try and find some stuff out before the meeting people, that would be good.

      Funniest James Stannage quote ever. Clocked at about 12.58am today.  You could tell the woman was stupid just from the sound of her voice and attitude, but anywho, when the convo was leading to an end it went like this:  Woman: So where abouts were you born? James: The North East. Woman: Where's that, I'm terrible with directions. James: Ok, think of a town across the Pennines. Woman: Wales? James: *FOCL ROFL LOLOLOL* etc etc.  It was the funniest thing I ever heard.  Whoamg, Physics exams today O_O.  -Phil out.

      Lol - just found this of a link from google.....  "Legal implications are also significant.  In the Canon Street Station case of "CeNsOrEd" the defendants (a major construction company) were found guilty and the whole trial stopped early by the judge because unauthorised disturbance had taken place within the scheduled area, and so the defendants were guilty whether or not the monument was actually damaged."

      Yeah, it was me that changed the template... I got bored with the old one.  I set up the links.. And commented out the previous posts thing. It seems quite pointless for this blog... I (or someone else) can always uncomment it later on. Everyone now needs to set up their profile so they all work... Also, can I remove "Graeme" from the members list? He hasn't posted for ages. You can also leave comments if you want.

Ah well it was a good laugh and I can't remember dropping Phil off home...  But I still don't think you can call me an alcoholic seeing as I don't even drink pretty much at all.

      Firstly, what the hell is sheldon on about in every single post he has ever made.  Secondly,&nbsp;kirby could at least have left the country during this 3 week "roadtrip with parents" type holiday or am I just misunderstanding him.&nbsp; When he says roadtrip does he mean they will be driving to their destination then getting out?  Finally I hope our trip is still on as I have bought a few bottles of beer back from France at a reasonable price, if there is 8 of us going it will cost everyone £1.50ish for it.  &nbsp;  Ok off to London on Teusday with Mr Rawling and co... oh dear see you when the real holidays start I guess.  &nbsp;  Oh yeah I broke my toe so can't play football for a while.

      Yarr, I think the party (if you can call it that) at Phils is a good Idea. Also I think we should use the week to stage the staying awake contest. God knows how long that will last. However if Sheldon comes, we shall all fall asleep due to his constand mumblings. Oh no wait he has to work :D.
