      Take the quiz:  urlLink Which Random Irish Gaelic Phrase Are You?     Ta me air meisce  Ta me air meisce - 'I am drunk.'You enjoy a drink - or five - now and then. You can usually be found in a pub - it doesn't matter which one, because they all look the same after a few drinks - or hugging the porcelain.

      Just as I suspected, I didn't sleep very much last night. I finally dozed off at about 3 and woke up at 7:42. Good times.  I am, however, feeling much better about life this morning. I don't feel like I need to be  urlLink shipped off  to  urlLink Milledgeville  and I'm actually in a pretty decent mood. I figured that bequeathing all of that emotional trash upon the information superhighway would have that effect. Thanks, I needed that.  Plus, it's Friday and I'm leaving this town tomorrow (if only for one night).

      Disclaimer: This is going to be very depressing and probably very long because I think I'm in the middle of another mental breakdown. Be warned. I'd stop reading right now if I were you. Go watch  urlLink This Land is Your Land  (again). Check up on the  urlLink Braves  or  urlLink Dawgs . Get the latest  urlLink sports updates . Look at some fun  urlLink t-shirts . Go wash your car. Take a nap. Order some  urlLink CDs or some books . Have fun perusing the  urlLink pictures  on  urlLink my website . I'm telling you -- do anything to avoid reading this because I can tell right now that it isn't going to be very fun to read (now or ever). So stop. Turn off the computer and go to the gym.  Again, consider yourselves warned. I'm in rare depress-fest form tonight (sorry, morning now) and we all know how bad this can get.  I'm sitting in my room listening to stuff that isn't conducive to my mental well-being. I just got back from tha club. Well, not really, it was only Country Rock...and it was basically deserted...and it was a little bit lame, although we were the life of the party...but still -- it was fun. Well, unless we're talking about my emotional state.  The last two weeks have been rough...I'm not going to lie to you. Some of the roughest in recent memory, actually. And I don't know why. I just can't figure it out. If I could, well, I wouldn't be crazy. And we all know I am.  Honestly, the last ten or fourteen days have been a blur. They've all been essentially the same to me and the saying "same old shit, different day" doesn't even cover it. I haven't been able to sleep (which is why I'm sitting here writing this at 2am). I haven't been hungry, but I've eaten because one has to eat. I haven't been working out because I can't. The stupid moon boot prohibits that. It just ain't been pretty.  School started back this week, and my God is this semester going to be total hell. I have 8 books for one class, 6 for another, and 1 for the third. Books cost me $400 this afternoon. Graduate school, I am quickly learning, simply means that they continually pile work on you until you think you can’t take anymore. Then they give you a little more to make your life completely intolerable. Plus, football season begins in 2 weeks and I hope I can make it to some games. It’s going to suck, but such is the essence of my life.  And now, someone wants to start a relationship (albeit purely sexual), but that ain't happening anytime soon because she's married (in the initial stages of a divorce at the moment, which will certainly change soon, I'm sure). Since my parents managed to raise my crazy ass with some sense of morality, nothing is going to happen until both of their signatures are on the divorce papers. It’s not that I’m against casual sex (some of the morality didn’t stick very well), but sorry, but I'm just going to have sex with a married woman. Not gonna do it, wouldn't be prudent.  Cameron Diaz, Charlize Theron, and I are at the Country Rock tonight and it's karaoke night (names have been changed to protect the innocent). The host lady manages to talk us into singing a song (Sweet Home Alabama) and we weren’t that bad actually. Then I sing “You Never Even Call Me By My Name.” I don’t think I’m packing it up and moving to Nashville anytime soon, but I can hold my own on some karaoke. That song is a great karaoke song because everyone can get involved and have a good time. It’s a very interactive song. I drag my two companions up there with me to sing backup and some other folks crowd around us.  One of these people happens to be a pretty cute brunette who tells me bye and that I did a good job as I’m walking back to our table. Later, Charlize goes over to talk to her and brings her back to where Cameron & I are sitting. This is obviously a ploy to get me to talk to this unknown female, which (as we all know) RT sucks at doing. Charlize manages to get the two of us on the dance floor and I’m being myself – stuttering, searching for things to talk about, and just generally being the socially inept loser that I am when it comes to these things. As one might imagine, I didn’t have the courage to talk to this girl anymore, so that fell through.  This happens way more than I’d like to admit. I’d rather not talk to the girl again than to try to talk to her and be rejected. ‘Cause I absolutely cannot handle rejection. If I don’t go back over, then I won’t be rejected. I also won’t ever get a phone number, or a date, or anything like that…but at least I won’t have to suffer through the rejection.  All I can think right now is WTF? It hits me, as it often does, that I’m doomed to be alone. (It’s about to get real bad. You might want to go wash your hair or something now.) How in the hell am I ever going to find someone when I can’t even initiate a simple conversation, much less sustain the discussion for any length of time? The simple answer, albeit mighty disheartening, is that I won’t. It just isn’t going to happen. How the hell can it? How can I expect it to? To be perfectly honest with myself, I can’t.  But I still do. Some part of me still longs for the comfort of an actual relationship…some sort of companionship. And while part of me longs for that, another part just can’t take the possibility of rejection. That’s the part that wins out all of the time. And it’s killing me on the inside. And I don’t know how to fix it. Hell, I don’t even know if it can be fixed. This is the dichotomy that is eating at me right at this moment.  You might be thinking, “Why doesn’t this crazy ass just go to a shrink?” Believe me, I’ve been trying. Figuring out an insurance policy is about as easy as a blind man trying to decipher the Rosetta stone. Apparently, I have to call and ask permission to go to a shrink. Should that permission be granted, I then have to search out one who is in the PPO. It’s not only that, though, I have to find one who is actually accepting new patients. Plus, I’m limited to 20 visits per year. No, I’m sorry…my entire family is limited to 20 visits per year. WTF?  Insurance companies must hate me – I have surgery every year, I get sick at least twice a year, and I’m crazy. No wonder premiums are so damn high.  Okay, I'm done with this for now. Maybe I can sleep until 4 or 5 am tonight now...but I doubt it. The cable's out, too, which means that I'm just going to be lying in the dark watching the ceiling fan go 'round and 'round.  I love my life. Can't you tell? ;-)  Thanks for reading this emotional gibberish, although I told you not to. Oh, and I don't want pity - save that for someone who really needs it. I'll survive. It's what I do. I'll pick myself up, go to work tomorrow, meet my parents for dinner, and go watch my sister twirl the baton tomorrow night. Then, I'll go to Cherokee this weekend and watch some bluegrass. On Sunday, I'm going to a volunteer meeting for an  urlLink old professor who is running for political office . And come Monday, I'll hit the books and settle back into the role of the overachieving loser that I am. It's just what I do. While I do it all, everyone will think "He's just got everything so together" and other things of that nature which couldn't be further from the truth. It doesn't make life any easier, but it's how I operate. Always have, always will.

        I took a  urlLink personality quiz  today, and here are my results. I tend to agree with the first one more than I do the other one, although the second one has some valid points in there.    --------------------------------   You are a SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a Evil Genius.    You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.    Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world.     You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.    You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    Of the 1096 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004), 15.5 % are this type.     --------------------------------  You are a SRDL--Sober Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you a Mob Boss.    You are the ultimate alpha person and even your friends give you your space. You can't stand whiners, weaklings, schlemiels or schlemozzles. You don't make many jokes, but when you do, others laugh out loud. They must.    People often turn to you for advice, and wisely. You are calm in a crisis, cautious in a tempest, and attuned to even the finest details. Yours is the profile of a smart head for business and a dangerous enemy.You have a natural knack for fashion and occupy a suit like a matinee idol  .     Your charisma is striking and without artifice. You are generous, thoughtful, and appreciate   life's finer things.    Please don't kick my ass.    Of the 1093 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004), 4.6 % are this type.

      What I want to be doing: preparing for bed.  What I am doing: preparing to take a shower so that I can go downtown to watch L's band play. They are set to go on at either 12:30 or 12:50.  It's okay, though, because my insomnia has been getting increasingly worse over the past couple of weeks, so I wouldn't be sleeping anyway. At least there will be some form of entertainment to bide the time.

      I submitted my Brutally Honest Personal Ad to Esquire today. We'll see how that goes. Here's the ad:  Let’s get the good news out of the way first: I’m not in terrible debt (just some student loans and a small car loan) and I don’t have an STD (one actually has to have intercourse to get one of those). I take showers on a daily basis and wear deodorant. I work out at least three times a week and am in decent shape, but I still drink beer. I’m not skinny or very fat, but somewhere in the middle.  Now, the bad news (and there’s plenty of it): I’m not particularly attractive. Also, I am far from being a pillar of orthopedic health. Soon I am going in for my second ankle surgery in three years and last year I had part of my shoulder removed. Oh, and did I mention that I’m 23 years old? Many of my friends say that I’m the most accident-prone person that they know, and I cannot disagree with that. Murphy’s Law dictates my life, which brings me to my emotional stability. Or lack thereof. I drink way too much, smoke too many cigarettes, and take too many pills in a vain attempt to drain out the crippling emotional pain. I don’t date. Ever. It's not really my style to ask someone out. It's generally not my style to speak to an unknown female unless it's an absolute necessity. Instead, I like to just let those feelings foster for months upon end until the whole situation culminates in me getting hurt and never speaking to the other person again. This scenario has taken place numerous times throughout my life and the prospects for change aren't that wonderful. I am probably the most socially inept person who has ever lived when it comes to the whole issue of the other sex. To put it bluntly – I am simply terrified. You'd think that 40-year old computer nerds who still live with their mothers and can't wait for DragonCon every year would be worse than me. But I don't think so. I don't see how they can be, really. In all actuality, we're probably on about the same level of loserdom and being-alone-forever-dom. Just replace the Star Trek addiction with Law and Order: SVU or XBox NCAA Football and we're the same damn person. It's sad really.

      Law Dawg,  My apologies for not returning your phone call (regarding beer) the other night. Hopefully,  urlLink this can explain things .  In addition, a certain roommate of mine was there. No freakin' bueno. A different roomie didn't want any company because he had to get up early to go to work. Graham and I were given permission to partake...and as you can probably tell from the picture, we certainly did.  I hope that you'll accept a raincheck for the upcoming weekend.  My sincerest apologies,  RT

      Thank goodness I did my research yesterday, else I wouldn't have any fun links for the people (who don't look at this blog anyway) to enjoy today.   urlLink Guide to Trucker Speak  - 'cause everyone wants to know trucker lingo...   urlLink Reasons to Dispatch Bush  - This is an interesting little conglomeration of postings about why Dubya needs to get the boot.    urlLink I have no comment ...I really don't.

      This hasn't been a very fun week for me so far. Adjusting to the fact that my body is becoming weaker and weaker isn't my idea of a good time. This medieval torture device the doc has me wearing is really throwing me for a loop and it just ain't a wonderful experience.  As if that weren't enough to deal with,  J  returned home last night. I cannot put into words how much that  sucks . I haven't divulged to him that he owes me a nice little chunk of cash, so tonight should be even more fun.  There was the obligatory 93.56 grocery bags that always accompany him when he returns from Cobb, which is either the equivalent of Eden or one step above that heavenly paradise.  Then he had to wash clothes - pretty weird when  you're returning from your parents' house...where you can use  THEIR  washer, dryer, water, detergent, etc. instead of your own. But nope, there was lots of cabinet and door slamming until about midnight. Wonderful.  One positive - I do think he finally realized that I just generally don't want to speak to him.  "Hey man. I'm back." "Great." "So how was your summer." "Fine." "Awesome...blah, blah, blah." "Okay." "yadda f****** yadda yadda" "Uh-huh." The conversation goes on like this for another minute or so until he realizes that I am grimacing in pain...at which time he decided to leave. I have never been especially proud of that ankle until that point.   Then, later:    "Hey man, have you heard that f****** Jet CD?" "Yep." "Man, that s*** is f****** awesome." "Yep." "How about blah-blah." "Yep." "Oh, yeah man, that s*** f****** rocks too." "Yep." "F******-a. I'll burn you a copy of that s***. It's f******* awesome." "Ok. I'm going to bed now."       Why?    Why must we deal with this utterly detestable human being? I just don't get it. If he weren't a 14-year old boy with NO social skills trapped in the body of a 23-year old, it might be a little different story. As it stands, however, that's the situation. But why?   In the words of LawDawg, damn, damn, damn.

      I’m now officially an invalid…again. The doctor’s visit yesterday morning did not go as well as I had hoped, which sucks, but what else can ya do? When your body’s torn up, it’s torn up.  This time, however, it’s going to be even more fun because I’ve somehow aggravated the previous ankle injury to the point of needing surgery again. Whatever he fixed the first time is coming loose, causing laxity in there again…and that ain’t good, kiddos.  My problem seems to be  urlLink Enthesopathy , which is apparently an abnormality of tendon-bone attachments. To be specific – the tendon-bone attachment that he surgically repaired a year and a half ago is (for some reason) become loose. That's great because that problem's throwing the whole ankle off kilter, subsequently pissing everything else in there off and causing it to hurt like hell most of the time.  He doesn’t “advocate” surgery right now; instead, he put me in this  urlLink god-awful air-cast boot thing  that vaguely resembles a ski boot or the boot of a space alien. This boot, however, is much less cool than either of those...and it has to be much less comfortable.  Anyway, that’s probably enough about my painfully depressing orthopedic problems.  No one was at work yesterday, so I've been all by my lonesome thus far. It breaks my heart, lemme tell ya. I do have a lot of free time again today, so I’ve been perusing the Net to kill time. Between that and the country music that I have playing on the radio, the time's just  flying  by.  The JibJab guys now offer shirts and other goodies with their "This Land is Your Land" hilarity on them. They even have their own  urlLink online store .  The only problem is that I can't decide which shirt I want --  urlLink this one  or perhaps  urlLink this one . Maybe both if the paycheck is good enough next week. But it won't be.  There are also lots of funny shirts at  urlLink ebaynham.com  (Thanks,  urlLink LawDawg , for that one. It was a banner in the email you sent last week).  Yes, I am THAT bored.

      Despite the terrible grammatical form displayed in the title, some form of brewed delight is on the menu for dinner tonight. I thought I would do a little research into the wonderful world of beer. I found a great website that ranks beers (I think B told me about it the other night) called  urlLink Beer Advocate.com .  I've been a bit poor for the last 23 years of my life. My more recent dealings with poverty have driven me into the realm of drinking Southpaw Light, which is just about the best cheap beer out there at $5.99 a 12-pack (in bottles, at that).  Here are some beer scores that my research has uncovered:  Sam Adams Boston Ale - 86 Sam Adams Boston Lager - 85 PBR - 75 Schlitz - 75 Miller High Life - 74 Southpaw Light - 73 Steel Reserve (211 High Gravity)- 71 Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull - 68 Budweiser - 67  How, in the name of Eberhard Anheuser & Adolphus Busch, did Budweiser score lower than PBR, High Life, Southpaw, Steel Reserve, Schlitz, and even Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull? Wow people have some bad taste...literally.  PBR is almost undrinkable, even for my poverty-stricken beer-loving taste buds. Steel Reserve? It's one of the most unpalatable brews my taste buds have ever had the displeasure of experiencing! And High Life? The champagne of beers? I don't think so, Tim.  Anyway, interesting stuff there...yet, at the same time, perplexing.  (And for the part of me that longs for England:) Belhaven Scottish Ale - 85 Guinness - 85 Bass Pale Ale - 83 Old Speckled Hen - 82 Boddington's Pub Ale - 80 John Courage - 79 Stella Artois - 79  Old Speckled Hen does not taste good from a can in the States. It just doesn't. On tap at the Turf Tavern pub in Oxford, England, however, it's awesome. All of the others I listed are great on tap there, too, but many of them are actually drinkable in America.

      The Republicans can no longer complain about Hillary Clinton running for US Senate in New York while being a resident of Arkansas. Since  urlLink Barack Obama's excellent speech at the DNC  went over so well, the Republicans have been scrambling to find a candidate to oppose Obama's run for US Senate. That search has stopped at  urlLink Allan Keyes' back door ...in Maryland.  Yes, the same party that complained incessantly about Hillary Clinton's run for Senate has now done the same thing. Nice job there, Republicans. Silly me, I thought John Kerry was the " urlLink King of Flip Flops ."  And this move doesn't scream "We're running scared" to me. Not at all.
