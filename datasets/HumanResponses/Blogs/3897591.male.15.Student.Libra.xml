      This post maybe jus wat i think i am but im going to write it down lol (nuttin to write)   Ever since young i likes the feeling of winning =P i think it started when i was in P2 i think... having a guy in my class which is good in everything : Sport, Studies, n even my cca CO(chinese orchestra) hes the spotlight of our class hahaha... everytime in exam i would work hard to win him(childish) n even in NAPFA test 1.6km run (tts when i train hard for running i guess) my teacher in primary school has been the greatest of all.... they teaches us wif TLC even when we r so HYPER-ACTIVE n HYPER-NOISY... sumtimes i wish tt primary school can last longer... tt makes frenship of primary last even longer.. unfortunately... frenship in primary sch to me has broken...hardly see each other n when we met, we acted like stranger, how sad can it be when he was once ur best fren haiz... Aniwae, another thing tt i think i've changed alot... is tt i dun laugh much le....SO SIAN i love cracking jokes in primary school little kai xin guo but till sec 2 or 3 i stopped... dun even know y haha Do u think so ?  My biggest wish is to make alot of money lol wait.... biggest wish is tt all frens around me can be happy n had no trouble U happy I happy lol but it seems to me tt everyone had trouble tt i cant help much.... everyday in school pple r wearing mask pretending to be normal n jokes around when they reach home cry here cry there n think about sad things... sumtimes when i read others blog i will change my view towards tt person... looks like pple onli mention unhappy stuff on blog. hahaha Thus i wish tt all frens around me can be happy n had no worry May The Wind Of Laughter Be Wif You!! Alwaes Look On The Bright Side Of Life !!!
