      I usually eat a twix at 10:00 am at work. (that means in 20 minutes now) they currently have this thing where u enter on the web the codes that u find on the wrapping paper. when u get 15 codes (hopefully I will before the promotion ends) u get $10 gift certificate at ticketmaster if I understood correctly. a twix is $0.7 at the vending machine -> 15 twix = $10.50 ... that means they re almost free !!!   Update : actually they cost $.60 at the vending machine -> 15 twix for $9 and u get a $10 gift certificate, that s a good deal !

      yes, I got a bike today !! I finally choosed the treck 3700. I tried it for like 20 minutes, it seems pretty cool :-))  but I didn t know I would get tired soo quickly, i defenitely need to exercise more often. anyway, I am quite happy.  btw, as expected I didn t get the free helmet, but I managed to get a free kick stand. well it s not much (like $8) but it s symbolic. actually it was just to show roxie that u can always get something free :-)

      I am about to buy a bike. As always when it comes to spend a substantial amount of money, I spend hours researching the best item or at least the one that fits me (and my budget) the best. Anyway, I just don t know what to buy, I change my mind everyother hour. Should I buy a low end model at target, the best target bike or the cheapest model at a bike store (these propositions were sorted by prices) Should I buy a full suspension mountain bike, or a 'comfort' MTB would be better for me... My latest thought was to buy a comfort mountain bike at target. this would cost me $115 (on sale, orig price : $135), which is actually the first budget I imagined (after adding the different accessories). advantages : - cheap - more comfortable than a sport model - target -> if I am not satisfied I can return it within 3 months - expensive enough to get some good stuff (I am not an expert, but shimano derailleurs sound cool to me) disadvantages : - target -> who assembled it... if I have a problem, nobody is going to help me there... frame size is unique and not necessarily the best one for me - cheap   so in my mind I think, why buy an expensive bike if I don t bike every single day, and I bike more in the future, I will just upgrade it then. but in an other hand I am thinking : I don t buy a bike every day, this is not going to hurt me to spend some extra bucks for better quality...  so your comments are welcome folks !  ----------------- Update :  as expected I changed my mind again. I am now pretty sure to spend some extra money and buy at a bike store. I don t trust target quality that much and I think frame size is quite important and target bikes are all too small. I tried some bikes at a bike shop, and I can feel the difference just seating on it for 5 seconds. so I will certainly buy a mountain bike that is very capable on road too. I am thinking the trek 3700 ...

      I have a gmail account !!! (google mail). thank you so much Cynthia.  so far I like it. because it s still on beta program, the number of users is limited and so the access speed is great. but other than that, I like the features a lot !  what I like a lot is the way the interface behaved like it would be a stand alone software : what I mean is hen you look at your inbox, you click on an email and then go back to your inbox, the web pages don t reload each time. so when you have 10 new emails, it goes a lot faster that way. NO POPUP !!  their advertisement system does not bother at all. I like the grouping by conversations too. If u have some friends with who you have an email 'chat', replying back and forth to the same email all day, it will be shown as one line in your mailbox, not 20... which is cool to still be able to see your other emails. then when you click on the conversation, the display is 'forum like', which is nicer than the usual ">" ">>" ... ">>>>>>>>"  in front of the beginning of the discussion  and of course, what s great too : 1Gb of storage....  so far so good, I love it !

      I recently bought a packof big K cola to try it. I am a fan of pepsi one, diet pepsi and diet coke.  well I had a big deal, like $3 for a 12 cans pack, and it s actually pretty good.  I may give it a chance once in a while   Update : $3 for a 12 packs is not really a deal, I meant 24 cans
