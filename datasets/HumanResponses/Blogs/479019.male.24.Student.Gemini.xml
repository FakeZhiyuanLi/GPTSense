      For an explanation on posts from 2001, click   urlLink here  .  5/8 -  As those of you who have been here before might have noticed, I am once again playing around with the design of my page. I call this constant need to play with my page… competitive creativity… it’s the fire within me to constantly out do myself (and others). On to something interesting that I observed today at school that made me ask many questions. In front of the school around noon there were two groups of people making use of their right to free speech. To the left of me were leftists, who were rallying against police brutality and talking about Mumia, while to the right of me were right wing Christian fundamentalists preaching the word of God. As I stood there in the middle, I thought to myself that although I lean to the left in my political beliefs, the people around me are people who believe in universal truths, whether about God, human rights, the role of the government… I, on the other hand, do not believe in universal truths. One might describe me as a nihilist. I believe that nothing is truly objective and everything is subjective; therefore, what truly is truth if everything is subject to how we perceive the world? If nothing is true, then why should I care about God or Mumia getting executed?  5/6 - Despite waiting a while in line and missing Midtown and Thrice... I did manage to see the International Noise Conspiracy. As my brothers and sisters would say up north by the bay... it was "hella cool." The band put on an awesome show and I can`t wait to see them again.*****  5/5 - Yay it`s the weekend! Too bad it`s going to be a weekend of studying and thinking about what to do my term paper on for one of my sociology classes. However, I am looking forward to seeing the International Noise Conspiracy. That will most likely be the highlight of my weekend. Stayed tuned for a show review.***  5/3 - Nothing incredibly profound today. I`m taking a day off from social commentary and giving you a song of the moment instead. That song is the Vandals` "People That Are Going to Hell" from their Hitler Bad, Vandals Good CD (1998).  5/2 - Yesterday I left my thoughts on people who are uncreative and chose to demonstrate their sameness rather than individuality. Although in western civilization we stress individuality as an ideal, in practice how much of an individual are any of us? How bad do you want to fit in at the expense of what you really want? How often do you "discover" something cool for yourself instead of listening to others? I leave these questions for you all to think about.***  5/1 - I just had to mention how redundant it is for someone to have "azn" in their name on AA. I probably wouldn`t have noticed it if it was just a few uncreative people, but there sure is a lot of them out there. Then again maybe these people care more about being the same as another person rather than being an individual.*  4/30 - I spent the weekend doing field research for my sociology class. A lot of interesting stuff came up and if you ask I`d be happy to tell you about it. Aside from that, I put up some new pics on my website. Y`all can see them HERE. Other than that the most interesting thing of the weekend was my purchase of two new band t-shirts.***  4/29 - My buddy Kowloon2dx and I was discussing the perpetuation of online obnoxiousness last night with someone in a chat room. Our point of argument was that one does not have to be like everyone else and treat a chat room as a "meat market" or be an immature jerk. The cyber world has so much potential as a forum to share thoughts and make new friends, but unforuntately so many people make it a place of pervs and a$$holes. I think that people shold realize that despite the cyber world being a virtual world, that they are still dealing with real people; therefore, politness and sincerity is still very much appreciated.**  4/27 - Nothing particularly exciting going on in my life except for the fact I`ve been working and going to school. I`m jealous of everyone on semester system who gets out of school in a few weeks while I`m stuck in school for over a month. Anyway... the song of the moment is the Descendents` Rotting Out from their Everything Sucks CD (1996). ****  4/24 - The website of the moment is http://astrology.yahoo.com/. Check out the palmistry section on the page. It got me pretty accurate except for the parts where I couldn`t figure out which mount is most prominent on my hand.****  4/23 - A rather uneventful weekend (no offense to anyone I hung out with this weekend). Work, essay writing, with some leisure time to share with my friends and computer. Speaking of spending time with my computer, I`ve been playing around with the layout of my page. I hope all of you like it.***  4/20 - It`s 4:20! Hah cool. Well anyway the painting of the moment is Night Cafe (1888) by Vincent Van Gogh. It`s one of my favorite Van Gogh paintings.****  4/18 - As some of you know, Joey Ramone, a member of one of the founding punk rock groups passed away this past Sunday. So in honor of him the song of the moment is "Sheena is a Punk Rocker" from the Ramones` Rocket to Russia CD (1977).  4/17 - The movie of the moment is Amadeus (1984). A great movie that has quality acting, good music, and well written.*****  4/16 - Wow, 2 weeks down and 8 weeks of school left to go. I`m already feeling unmotivated. I need to kick it up a notch as Emmeril would say. "BAM!" Let`s hope the Sufferboy can get his GPA up this quarter.**  4/15 - The song of the moment is Ignite`s Veteran from their "A Place Called Home" CD (2000). This is a totally awesome song that kicks major tail. "Where are we, where are we now?" *****  4/13 - The link of the moment is www.wrestlecrap.com. It`s the perfect site for any old school pro wrestling fan.**** 4/11 - The painting of the moment is Lavender Mist by Jackson Pollock (1950). Abstract Expressionism rules!.*****  4/10 - Hah... no supervisors at work today. I got to slack off so much today. I barely did anywork today.***  4/9 - More random ramblings... I hear the International Noise Conspiracy is going to play at Chain Reaction in May. That should be interesting. Iwonder if I should try to interview them for my sociology paper.***  4/7 - Some random ramblings... Week 2 @ UCI is just about to start. Thus far my classes seem interesting, but hard. It looks like I`ll have to be pumping out some massive amounts of writing this quarter. Fun wouldn`t you say?*  4/6 - The song of the moment is Social Distortion`s "Don`t Drag Me Down" from their White Light, White Heat, White Trash CD (1996). "Your history books are full oflies..." *****  4/5 - The movie of the moment is Conan the Barbarian (1982) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, because I too seek the answer to the Riddle of Steel (aka the meaning of life). ****  4/4 - Link of the moment is www.obeygiant.com. You can get those Andre the Giant stickers that you see all over the place and be part of the posse.*****  4/3 - The painting of the moment is Night Hawks (1942) by Edward Hopper. It`s a great painting that is currently being used as my Windows wallpaper. If you have the time, I encourage you all to check it out. *****  4/2 - Wrestlemania was simply an amazing PPV. My Olympic hero Kurt Angle did an awesome job returning to his amateur roots. Another cool thing was Stone Cold Steve Austin being stone cold again. Best PPV I`ve seen in a while. *****   4/1 - Wrestlemania is today. "The grand daddy of `em all" as Jim Ross likes to call it. I`m hoping that my favorite wrestler Kurt Angle beats Chris Benoit, but we`ll all see in a matter of hours won`t we?   3/31 - The song of the moment is from Pennywise`s About Time CD (1995). Pennywise seems to love to use the word "day" in their lyrics, but they mange to use it really well. The song is track #1, Peaceful Day. "Tell me how to make it through the day." *****  3/30 - The movie of the week is Bill and Ted`s Excellent Adventure (1989). The Wyld Stallyns totally rule. Bill S. Preston Esquire and Ted "Theodore" Logan are simply amazing dudes!*****  3/29 - I basically spent the last 2 days working on my page. I hope you all enjoy it.  3/26 - I saw Propagandhi, Avail, and J-Church last night. Propagandhi is a cool band and Ilike what they have to say, but their live performances and music lacks something. Avail had a lot of energy, and the lead singer of J-Church looks like he got booted off the set of Kung Fu: The Legend Continues. ***

      For an explanation on posts from 2001, click   urlLink here  .  [12.12.01]  It`s been a long time since I`ve put anything new here.  But here I am... back... schools out and I need something to do.  Anyway... life is alright for me these days aside from a bit of boredom. It seems like my only ambition right now is to find some solace from the ideas running around in my head. Which means I`m not really doing anything physically and just sitting on my *bleep* most of the time.  Oh yes... before I go... I`ll mention that I`ve downloaded all of Bad Religion`s upcoming album The Process of Belief (2002). A brilliant album. It`s their fastest and probably most religious album ever. Honestly, for a band called Bad Religion, they never really sang about religion very much. They`ve tended to sing mostly about society and science (after all Greg Graffin is a scientist). However a lot of their songs on this album deal with belief and religion. Even the song of the moment ... "Sorrow" ... has a lot of metaphors and brings up issues that have long been theological ones. All I can say is interesting timing...  Here are the lyrics for y`all  Father can you hear me? How have I let you down? I curse the day that I was born... And all the sorrow in this world...  Let me take you to the hurting ground Where all good men are trampled down Just to settle a bet that could not be won Between a prideful father and his son Will you guide me now, for I can`t see A reason for the suffering and this long misery What if every living soul could be upright and strong  Well, then I do imagine... There will be Sorrow Yeah there will be Sorrow And there will be Sorrow, no more  When all soldiers lay their weapons down Or when all kings and all queens relinquish their crowns Or when the only true messiah rescues us from ourselves  It`s easy to imagine... There will be Sorrow Yeah there will be Sorrow And there will be Sorrow, no more  ***   [11.21.01]   Sick as a dog... day 2   *

      Man I'm stressing on the acceptance/rejection letters. UCSB said I'll know any day now. It's nerve racking. So far I've been rejected by Berkeley, UCLA and UCSD and I only have UCSB and Cornell left. Cornell is a total long shot so I need UCSB to accept me. They say that the later the response the better as they have to print up all the papers for you to sign and stuff. I really hope so. My life is so screwed if I don't get into graduate school!   Looks like I need to cut my weight down from 148 to 142 by Friday at 1 PM for the wrestling tournament if I want to wrestle with the team. The likelihood of that happening is slim to none without a hard wrestling work out. I pretty much have to starve myself for the next 48 hours in addition to working out hard to make it. I guess I have no choice eh? I start cutting tomorrow. I guess I won't be downing too many brews with Flo tomorrow night?  I've been listening to some One Man Army lately. They're a freaking fun band to watch. I highly recommend their  Last Word Spoken  (200) album.  ***

      I had a pretty good weekend until Sunday night. I just felt all my energy drain out and I was pretty much in bed by 8PM, despite dozing long before that. I had a lot of fun hanging out with friends and seeing people I haven't seen since high school. It was great, but I didn't get any work done for school.  I still don't feel like I have any energy. I haven't felt like this since I was in high school cutting weight for wrestling. I think I need to take some more vitamin supplements and consume more carbohydrates. Things really hit rock bottom recently and now is not a good time for it to do so. I missed work today because I just felt too weak to get out the door. I showered and could barely stand up in there.  Something good that's happened is getting the  Process of Belief  b-side "Shattered Faith." As it always seems to be the case, the lyrics on that album is pretty fitting for what's going on right now. Regardless of that, the song is awesome. I really need to get the import of the album so I can really own that song!  ***

      I had another good day. I woke up relatively early this morning despite going to bed really late. I think I woke up around 10 AM. I was up last night studying and painting. Which was cool. Today I managed to write some emails to some old friends, pick up some new shirts... one of which is a Big Wig shirt... woohoo! In addition to working and working out. I feel relatively energized. I feel like going out and downing some brews with some boys but there aren't any around. That's kind of a bummer. Where are some fellow alcoholics when you need them?  On my to do list tomorrow is work, try to get Bad Religion tickets, meet up with a group partner for my sociology project, and maybe call up some friends to hang out. Life is getting ever better!  ***

      I actually had a pretty darn good day today. It was just plaing relaxing despite me waking up at the crack of dawn to get a paper done. I feel like a major burden has been lift off my shoulders. I feel like things are finally starting to straighten themselves out. As Bad Religion said... "there comes a time for a man to walk away." I think I just did that. Let's just hope universe and other parties accept my decision.  ***

      A long day of school. Feeling kind of tired and not in a good mood due to the results of my midterms. Let's just say I have to work my ass off in my classes to get grades I consider acceptable. I'm also feeling anxiety over grad admissions, feeling a bit bummed because I'm not talking to my friend that I normally talk to everyday, and I need to get lots of reading done (as usual). I'm sure life will straighten itself out, but things have just been so hectic lately in my life. I can't wait until spring break. I kind of want to do something like camping, just to escape everything and everyone.  I guess the song of the moment is Joey Ramone's cover of "What a Wonderful World" that's due out on his upcoming  Don't Worry About Me  album.  *

      No school today, but I had to work. Lovely stuff as usual. I'm so getting tired of working there. There's just no excitement or anything cool about the job except for the fact that I get paid $10.20 an hour! Damn living in a capitalist society. Damn being programmed with the virtues of liberal consumerism! - - "Viva la Revolución!"  At least I got to work out thanks to there being no school. I like the fact that my metabolism is fast enough that when I work out, I can totally see and feel a difference right away. However, I need increase my caloric intake to compensate. I'm noticing that if I don't get enough energy in my system, I'll get exhausted just like today after I worked out. I need to start getting up earlier in the morning to eat breakfast so that I have the fuel in me to last through the day! Having some extra protein in the morning should help muscle building too.  Did I mention that were hot girls at the gym? Spandex, stair steppers, and a good rear end view... that's all I've got to say about that.  Jon and Brandon are going to be over to watch Hogan on WWF RAW. That's going to amazing. The Hulkster back! Say what you will, but the big boot and leg drop is amazing!  The song of the moment is "I'm Like Yeah But She's All No" by the Mr. T Experience from their  Love is Dead  (1996) album.  ***

      I've noticed that I've been able to enjoy some good TV time, just like the old days before college and working. I've been managing to catch shows ranging from Simpsons, Buffy, WWF, Malcom in the Middle, Titus, Family Guy and King of the Hill. This is cool because now I feel like a part of society again! Induling in culture! I'm such a hypocrite for saying that because I was protesting to Lisa about my rejection of the notion of culture 2 nights ago. Well... of course culture matters! It still is, however, a social construction. Too bad we are cogs in the machine we call society!  I managed to get some more work on my painting done. It's too bad the time that went into it should have gone into more reading time. So much to do, so little time!  Well... hopefully I'll have more time tomorrow due to there being no school. I still have work though.  ****

      Haven't been awake very long, but the hours that I have been awake have been productive.  I went to San Diego yesterday. It was cool. I had dinner with Julia and her friend and then went down to Andy's to have some drinks and see some experimental electronic music at the Casbah. It was pretty cool, but I was damn tired towards the end. The alchohol and the fact that I worked all morning was a factor. A contributing factor was the fact that before work yesterday, I only had a couple hours of sleep. Afterwork, I had gone out to eat with George and Lisa, and then I talked with Lisa on the phone for a while before chatting online until rather late. This all made my drive home pretty tough. I so did not want to fall asleep at the wheel.  I think one of the things I like most about San Diego is the radio. (Too bad I go reject from SDSU!). 91.1 and 92.1 are awesome stations. Seriously any station that plays the Hives has to pretty damn cool. I know all stations are influenced by corporations, despite 92.1 being independent. I know they cannot ignore those forces, but at least these stations aren't as influenced to the extent that KROQ 106.7 is.   I managed to get some studying done today, but I didn't get to go to the gym due to it closing early due to President's Day. I'm going to relax some more and then probably study more. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to get some painting done too!  Anyone else curious about what the nWo will do at the PPV?  ***

      I decided to change my work schedule. I'm not working Thursday nights anymore and it feels good so far. I was so overworked. There's no way I can hand two history 190s inaddition to 2 sociology classes and working 20+ hours a week. I was coming home too tired and not being able to do any readings on Thursday nights. The readings I need to do for my classes are simply an everyday thing. I'm playing too much catch up!  The loss of may from working less is going to suck, but I need to do some shopping for stuff tomorrow. I'm basically going to take it easy and then have some fun in San Diego this weekend at Andy's. I need an escape after this tough week!  **

      Here I am at the HIRC at UCI killing time. I couldn't stand reading at the little cafe by HIB anymore. It was got to disturbing. It seemed that everybody with a devasting problem in their life just had to come and sit near me. I'm not kidding either. There were two girls sharing their experiences of being raped. I'm not kidding. That was some fucked up shit man. They were talking about how it happened and how they're trying to get over it. That's pretty sad and disturbing stuff to hear, because it was so real. I mean, you hear about that shit happening on TV and when there are guest speakers in class or assemblies, but damn... this was the real deal. They weren't trying to get a message out. They were just trying to work through their problems, their fears of their assaulters, who never got punished for their actions! In addition to that, there was another girl who was telling her friend about all the sexual harassment she suffered through during a job interview! Man... and I thought my life was "hilariously cruel" as that poster put it. What I'm suffering through now, I can deal with. I won't be traumatized for life, like these poor souls. It's ironic that through the suffering of others that you can make the realization that life isn't really that bad as you thought.   Speaking of irony, what's up with that poster that says "Life is hilariously cruel" with a red cross out symbol over the symbols of the 3 major monotheistic religions on Ring Road? If that, amongst other things, doesn't say that there is such a thing a fate or some sort of power guiding the potential random occurances in life, I don't know what does. So "life is hilariously cruel?" Yep, it's cruel. Hilariously? I guess it is. Someone once told me that shit comes in threes... or whatever number it is. I mean it can't get much worse than 2 rejections: one from a girl, and one from UCSD, in addition to failing a midterm right? Well only if shit comes in multiples higher than three I guess.  Anyway on my list of things to do today are finish reading that book on coffee in Brazil, write a 5 page book review on that book, and get some studying done for the mass communications midterm.  Will the hilarity cease? We'll see!  **

      Woohoo! I'm feeling better! Not completely well, but I hope to get there!  Supposedly your mental health affects your physical health. Well I think starting off the day getting NOFX/Rancid tickets for 4/18 in Anaheim is a good start! This is so cool. I started off the year with Bad Religion, and now I'm going to go see NOFX and Rancid. I consider 1994 the best year of music in my life time and all these punk bands churned out some awesome stuff!   Working out always seems to make me feel better when sick and today was no different. Despite choking back some vomit, I had an epiphany that I know have a game plan to deal with one of my frustrations.  Mushroom pizza is always a smile maker!  Notre Dame is slowly but surely taking shape. I need a couple days before I continue work due to the paint needing to dry up a bit.  The thing that sucks the most about being sick is not being able to drink because I don't want to mix alcohol with cold medication. I don't want to know the meaning of life that bad.  Now for some reading, Simpsons, Malcom in the Middle, and probably some snacks in there somewhere.  ***

      OK I'm off to bed and leaving Morpheus on to download some One Man Army and Bad Religion music videos.  On my to do list for tomorrow.   -Buy Rancid/NOFX tickets! -Work out. -Work on my painting. -Finish reading  Swingin' the Dream: Big Band Jazz and the Rebirth of American Culture . -Try to get better! This cold is so annoying!  If I get the chance, I need to go shopping for:  -Pants. -a frame. -Get the  Process of Belief  Australian or Japanese import, so I can listen to "Shattered Faith." -Some cheapo classical music CDs -Some new paintbrushes.   ***

      Today was actually quite productive.  I managed to gets some pictures from my trip to Europe scanned, work out, and start a new painting.  Hopefully I'll get some of the pictures up soon. I scanned pictures of Amsterdamn, Venice, and France.  My work out today was alright. I haven't worked out in a while which meant my body couldn't bust out as much power, but I managed to tire myself out. I really need to keep this up so that I'm in shape for the wrestling tournament in March.  As for my new painting, I'm painting Notre Dame Cathedral. I'm painting it from one of the photos I scanned today. It's actually coming out really good. I'm surprised. I think my painting lately has been many times better than it was since I last painted which was approximately 1.5 years ago. You would think that not painting in a long time would make it so that I'm out of practice, but that's not the case. Maybe the reason why I'm painting so well right now is because I'm  feeling  more right now than I have in a while. And art after all is about an external expression of what's inside of you.  Something else about painting recently, is that it's one of the few escapes that I really have from the frustrations around me. That's a good thing.  I should probably study for midterms or read for my history classes.  The song of the moment is "Evangeline" by Bad Religion from  Process of Belief  (2002).  ***

      Earlier I took a look at my friend Naomi (2)'s blog and saw a link to http://www.colorgenics.com/. Well I went to it and I was shocked at what happened. That site is one of those you answer questions and then it generates a profile thing. The only difference is you pick colors and it generates it. Well... I did it twice. The first time I carefully picked colors and it was semi-accurate. However, when I just blindly clicked colors really quick, the profile it generated was dead on accurate on everything. It's scary. It's especially scary at a time like this where I have a lot going on. Life really is crazy.  ***

      Can I say the past 2 days have been eventful?  Well that all depends. Thoughts and feelings on things haven't changed. There's still the frustration with aspects of my life, that I have yet to find a complete and full solution to. I still feel a need to escape. However, those thoughts and feelings are now more on the surface and less repressed. That may or may not be a good thing... and with all things... time will tell...  I good thing to note is my worries about my digital arts minor has diminished somewhat. I checked with the School of the Arts and it looks like there are many options available to me.  I need to do something completely different tonight. I'm gonna go out for a little drive.  The song of the moment is Bad Religion's "Sorrow" from their  Process of Belief  (2002) album.  **

      Really boring and exhausting day.  Work in the AM, school in PM, and after school it was sitting around on my ass relaxing.  My presentation today was lame. I wasn't really prepared and I wasn't really feeling into it, especially since a guest speaker went before me.  I think I'm gonna just relax with some beer.  **

      It's funny how dense I am. Ok maybe not. A girl grabs my hand and gives it a little squeeze, in addition to smiles and gives me a lot of eye contact, and I don't do anything. I'm defineately not a man of action (like Arnold said about Riordan), and that's cost me opportunities in the past. Maybe I should really be a bit more active in some aspects of my life?  Teen Jeopardy is on this week... I wish I had a chance to be on it when I was a teen. Maybe I can be on College or regular Jeopardy? I know I can do well on it, as long as I don't get matched up against someone really good.   Well anyway... Jeopardy is over now. I'm going get to work on my paper for history of coffee now.  ***

      Here I am at school, at the HIRC. Killing time before my statistics discussion section.  Man... I was tired this morning! Despite dozing during RAW and going to bed around 12:45 AM, I was doing some serious nodding off in stats this morning. What was even worse was the guy sitting next to me kept raising his hand, which meant the professor had to be looking my way. That was totally annoying. The only amusing thing about the guy next to me was he kept hitting on the girl next to him. It was funny because she was trying to ignore him, despite his attempts to make conversation. Alas, the only thing that amuses me in that class are things like this.  Well anyway, after all that torture, I took a 30 minute nap in the basement of the Main Library like I normally do. Then I went to the pub for lunch, before heading to my mass communications class.  I like the pub, but the desire to have a beer during lunch at the begining of the quarter put a drain on my cash flow. Speaking of which I still need to pay my bills.  Lisa commented that she noticed that I was writing about a lot of stressful stuff in my blogs. She made a sarcastic remark about living with it, like she does. I think it was thought provoking, because of all the people I know, no one's life is more full of stress than hers. In addition to that, she handles it marvelously. I think her little comment was a bit of a reality check. Things could be a lot worse, and even if they were worse, it's something that can be worked through. So I'm feeling a bit better now, thanks to her.  Well now on to read some articles on coffee on the course webpage.  ***

      It's been an up and down day... but mostly down.  I only got about 2 hours of sleep last night... from 6 AM to 8 AM. I just couldn't get myself to bed. I simply had too much on my mind. I did surprisingly well on the alertness factor despite all that. I even managed to make it to work relatively on time... 3 minutes late.   Work was alright today. It was almost the same old story, except for the fact that the big wigs of the West Zone were in the office. Also my stomach was giving me problems, so I ended up dropping a load in the bathroom. Heh, quite an impression for the bosses eh?  Picked up a book left for me by my history professor at the history department... man is that sucker big. As if I don't have enough to read already!  Class was the usual stuff. More Popular Front culture and politics... only this time it was on dance. I'm not really into dance, so the subjects didn't really interest me. Speaking of dance. I'm not really getting the whole hand switching thing in my salsa class. It's kind of vexing.  The song of the moment is "Minstrel Boy" by Joe Strummer And The Mescaleros from  Global A Go-Go .  ***

      It's early morning and I'm up working on my webpage. I just couldn't get myself to bed. It's a combination of sleeping all day and having a lot of stuff on my mind. I guess I'm just simply not used to dealing with stress. My workload this quarter is unbelievable compared to the past. It's a bit scary to think that this is what graduate school is like. Reading entire books non-stop. Writing all the time. It's no wonder it's tough to be a grad student. How do you make enough money to surivive when you're working your butt off? And if you're working, will you have much of a life? I guess that's why I see so many of my TAs in the pub!  I guess I'll find out about grad school in the next few weeks. Right now I'm wishing I applied to more East coast schools. I feel like I need a change of scenary and an escape from some of the things here in So. Cal. that make life more frustrating than they need to be. If I were to not get into any graduate schools... I would need to find a way to getaway from Irvine. I know I'm not the only one. I've heard the same from Remy and Naomi.   Well anyway. I've got a lot of stuff up on my page now. If you're actually seeing this, feel free to browse.  **

      Hmm slept for 2 hours after my last post. Watched the history of what Americans eat on the History Channel. Ate dinner. Read 10 pages of  Stepping Left , and then listened to Bad Religion on the Kevin and Bean show via KROQ's webpage.  Listening to BR on there is making me feel kind of pissed off I'm not going to see them at the Palladium. I kind of want to give a big middle finger to KROQ for making Bad Religion popular again, and an even bigger finger to the people who abandoned BR after  Stranger than Fiction  (1994). The only good things about this regained interest in BR is the fact that they probably won't be breaking up anytime soon. Well unless they pull something like the Police did in 1982.  Procrastination is my enemy!  Back to work.  Now playing is some Beethoven.  **

      Yesterday is now gone...   Watched some of the Seaview League finals at Laguna Hills High. It was a kind of a dissappointment, since Irvine's not the wrestling program it used to be. I also had to cut out early because I had to go check out a book from the UCI Main Library and have dinner with Lisa.  Dinner with Lisa was cool. She came over and made some Ecuadorian food... beef, potatoes, rice... at the time it was alright, but now many hours removed, I think it was really good. That's probably why I gobbled up all the left overs for lunch. I had the same delayed reaction when I had Ethiopian food with Naomi. I guess I need to contemplate before I appreciate. Afterwards we chatted on a variety of things, I taught her how to do charts on Excel and installed Power Point on her laptop, and we went to see  A Beautiful Mind , which was a good movie.  All in all yesterday was a cool day, topped off with good eats, and good entertainment.  Today is a different story. On my to do list today is...  Read  Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942  by tomorrow. It's 177 pages!  Do 14 statistic problems by Tuesday!  Read  African Perspectives on Colonialism  by Wednesday for my presentation. It's a 112 pager.  Read 2 history of coffee articles by Wednesday. They're 19 and 36 pages.  Write a 5 page paper on the 6 history of coffee articles I'm supposed to have read by Wednesday!  I don't even remember what I need to do for sociology 155!  If I get a chance I might try to work on Lisa's eucharist calendar dilemma.  Playing right now is "Anesthesia" by Bad Religion, a song which I won't be hearing on March 30th at the Palladium, because I won't be there!!!  **

      Woohoo... 99.99% finished with my family portrait. I just need to put a signiture on it!  Now approximately 40% finished with my reading for my history of coffee class!  0% reading done for my Depression culture class, and work done on my mass communications and stats classes.  That's a lot of crap I need to get done in the next few days.  In rotation "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" (1892) by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  I'm off to bed now.  ***

      I got back from work, ate, and now I'm online (like the computer addict that I am).  Work was pretty quiet due to Florida getting a power outtage and the offices there shutting down early. Kind of bad luck for us with it being 2 days into sweeps. Anyway, it's the same stuff I've been doing for the last 11 months, so nothing really exciting. I was very eager to get home!  On brighter side of things (sarcasm there)... now I get to do some more reading on the history of coffee in Asia and Africa! I really need to get that crap done so I can get other crap done. I think that if I get 2 articles finished, then I'll work on my painting.  In rotation right now is the "Before You Were Punk" (1997) compilation.  ***

      Work... Work... Work... Read... Read... Read...  That's pretty much life right now. As you might have noticed, my site is on a new server (slow ass cox.net), and I've done some redesigning (again!). This time using www.blogger.com and an old webpage design. I hope to get things fully functional soon, but "so much to do, so little time." I still have to finish my reading and prepare for my presentation for my history of coffee class, read another entire book for Depression culture class, and do homework for sociology of mass communications and stats! Other stuff that's on my to do list includes finish my family portrait and host a small dinner tomorrow night!  In rotation right now is Weezer's "Blue" album (1994) and "Pinkerton" (1996).  ***

      Ah yes... it's spring break. I've been enjoying relaxation the past few days, which is a good thing. The only drag of a thing is working 5 days this week, but since hanging out with friends, drinking, eating, and stuff cost money... 2 extra days of pay is a good thing.  I've been listening to lots of new music lately as well. Bessides discovering a new radio station... 94.3 Super Cool... I've been listening to some 88 Fingers Louie, Anti-Flag, Nicotine, White Stripes, Elvis, Four Tops, and Del Shannon. An interesting mix there eh?  I've noticed the whole garage sound is really getting kind of big. That's pretty cool stuff. There's just something about that sound. What I think would be really cool is if someone went back and brought back the sounds of doo wop and old Mo-town with a modern twist. Something like juxtaposing modern left politics with the retro sound of such a reactionary time?  In rotation right now is Anti-Flag's  Underground Network  (2001). I'm really digging the opening track, "Angry, Young, and Poor."  ****

      2 pages down... 6 more to go for my paper on capitalist hegemony for my history class. I knew I should have actually done some work last night instead of just going to bed early. After that I need to write up some notecards for my statistics final. Happy happy joy joy. On the brighter side of things, only one more day left of the quarter. Then it's spring break! Woohoo.  **

      I'm like totally finding any excuse possible to not do my statistics homework, which is due at 9:30 AM. That leaves me about 9 hrs and 15 mins to get it done, sleep, and get to class. As you might be able to tell from my procrastination, I can't wait until the end of the quarter. I'm slowly but surely crawling my way to the finish line. After this week I just have a take home final (7-10 page paper) and a real final for statistics... which will all be done by Thursday!  I'm just feeling totally tired of school. I don't know if it's senioritis or if its the workload this quarter. I hope I recharge my batteries over spring break and I'm ready to go for my last quarter at UCI. It's hard to believe it's almost over.  **

      I started the week off with a bang and now nothing exciting is going on. I was exhausted today despite going to bed early last night. I think my body is so used to even black coffee that the stuff makes me more drowsy than awake. I was barely holding on at work this morning. It sucked.  In other interesting news. 3 days have passed since I cussed out a friend of mine and no guilt. That means I know I did the right thing. I mean, normally knowing that you did something to hurt someone you care about makes you feel bad; however, I don't. I'm a pretty patient, easy going guy that can take shit pretty well, but sometimes people take advantage of that fact. When that happens I feel that I have to make a stand, especially after many compromises in the past. Life goes on.  In rotation right now is the Cars, One Man Army, Bad Religion, and Bouncing Souls.  ***

      According to Colorgenics.com (which is one scary, but accurate website), I'm feeling really bogged down...and extremely stressful. This is due to the desire for personal independence which has been evading you for some time now. An existing situation and relationship is causing me to be extremely restless and I feel that I am unable to change the situation without co-operation. My situation with school and people (specifically one person) is causing me to be restless. I'm unwilling to expose my vulnerability, so I don't want to give in and be nice and work things out. I see this relationship as a depressing tie, but although I want to be independent and unhampered, I do not want to risk losing anything. Sometimes you just want to get away from it all. All this leads me to react touchily and with impatience, while the urge to get away results in considerable restlessness. My ability to concentrate has suffered. This is totally true. I'm having trouble just sitting down and getting crap done due to lack of concentration.  I guess the stress that I am experiencing at this time is due to the present situation, but it is a situation of my own making. Trying to ignore it - hoping that it will go away, has aggravated it further. Maybe I should slow down ... to relax and re-think the situation...  The song of the moment is "Gotta Get Away" from the Offspring's  Smash  (1994) album.  **

      Ok well I got my ass kicked at the tournament. It's not surprise, but I hit this totally awesome fireman's carry right off the whistle in my first match. I could have stuck the guy right at the start of the match if the mat was regulation sized. It was great. I got some major cheers on that one! I however then started gassing and screwed up my arm in the match and eventually got pinned myself. Oh well. It's no big deal.   I think my performance had to do with me not getting to bed until 4 AM. I hung out with some girls from Cambridge and Downtown Disney. It was lots of fun hanging out again.   Anyway I'm exhausted right now. I got a few hours of sleep when I got back from the tournament, but my sore arm and exhaustion is probably going to keep me in tonight. We'll see. Maybe Brandon will give me a call back and we can just drink a bit tonight.  ***

      There's no way I'm going to get my weight down by 1 PM tomorrow. I can barely make 150 as it is. Looks like I'll be getting my ass kicked at 158 on Saturday.  In other sucky news. Still no word from UCSB. The anxiety is killing me!  I also have to do 3 papers by next next Monday. 2 two page papers and one 5 pager. I might have to do an addition 5 page paper in 2 Wednesdays, but it depends on what I get on my last paper.  Finals is also coming up. Life is mighty stressful right now. Hopefully I get to get out and have some fun tomorrow.  *

      Today I slacked...I went to class this morning, did minimal research, forgot my student ID... so I couldn't check the book I needed out, went to the pub with Alex, and then went home and slept for 3 hours. That meant I missed yoga... oh well... no eye candy for me this week. Bummer...  In other news that book I needed was put on hold so that I can go back for it. It should be useful because it's about the  Commonweal  Catholic newspaper. There's a useful section on Catholic sentiments toward the Spanish Civil War. That's immensely useful for my paper.  I also managed to get 2500 mp3s full id3 tagged! Only 616 more to tag or delete (major organizing working going on on my D: drive).  ***

      Today was extremely productive and useful. I didn't go to bed until almost 5 last night. As I talked to Jenny for several hours and then proceded to download music. Yes more mp3s for me. I'm a total concert and mp3 addict right now. But it's culture, man! Historians will be looking back on what I'm doing now in 50 years and be research this! Or perhaps me!  Speaking of history... I got some more research done today. I managed to get stuff on  Blockade  from  Variety  and  The Daily Worker , as well as get the stuff from the  Motion Picture Review Digest  printed. After that I actually went to the gym to work out... I gotta get myself in good physical shape for Warped Tour!  Playing right now is some nice accoustic stuff such as an accoustic version of  Offspring 's "Defy You," Jimmy Eat World's "The Middle,"  Bad Religion 's "Do What You Want," and Green Day's "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)."  ****

      Fuck... blogger.com fucked up on me a bunch of times last night. I had a much more detailed post, but I've got to leave for work in about a half an hour.  Anyway on to the good stuff...  On the Unwritten Law show last night:   It was much better than when they opened for Blink-182 at the UCI Bren Events Center 2 years ago. The show had a great music festival feel due to being outdoors on the student center lawn, despite the gloomy weather. Girls flashing and an awesome pit despite people not really knowing how to mosh. Not many punk rock veterans ( what do you expect from a school that's 60% Asian? ); however, everyone was there to have a good time, which is great. It was a good 1 hour plus long set of real hard punk with some pop-ish and metal-ish stuff tossed it. I had a great time and thought it was an awesome show. This is one of the times when I'm proud of going to UCI.    That's it from me. Off to work...  ****

      Hmm... I've got work at 8:30 AM tomorrow at a free Unwritten Law show around 6PM. I should probably go to bed.  As I look back at my day before I go to bed. It's been a productive day. Sure I didn't get exactly what I wanted, but I found out that Quigley one of the the Catholic dudes behind the Hays code had his paper the  Motion Picture Hearld  amongst other Catholic papers just trash  Blockade . It's also interesting that IATSE projectionists didn't want to show the movie do to the politics. This is great stuff! I typed up a bunch of my research notes from today, which is a good thing. In a few days I won't be able to read my writing.  Ok off to bed!  ***

      I just got home... well not quite just... I ate before starting this... but anyway... I got home from UCLA and the Herrick library. It's been a long day. I had stats at 9:30 AM, then stats lab, then a meeting with my professor for 192w. Then after going to the bank and getting gas, I went up to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Herrick library in Beverly Hills.  I can't believe someone checked out the  Blockade  script. I did manage to get some research done there. It was kind of cool there. I need to give them a call to see if they have the periodicals I need to take a look at.  I majorly got lost at UCLA! That really drained me... Special collections was closed by the time I got there, but I got some useful info.  ***

Anyway... between June 16 and June 30, 1938 in the LA Times, there were minimal mentions of  Blockade . I suppose I'll go through some of July...  I forgot to ask my teacher if I can take time off and what the assignment is...  Well off to work... I'm exhausted and don't really want to go... bleh...  **

Last night's additions include the new Face to Face album  How To Ruin Everything , Randy's  You Can't Keep A Good Band Down , and Nerf Herder's  My E.P. .

      Ok... done with my annoying Soc Sci 3a crap...  I saw the  Scorpion King . It was actually a good movie. It surpassed all my expectations. It was all action, it had Kelly Hu basically naked throughout the whole movie, and the Rock battling fire ants. I can't really say much more about it. It was quick and to the point.  I'm off to bed early tonight... or at least I'm going to try to be. On my to do list for tomorrow is... art, looking through the Hays papers for stuff on  Blockade , lunch, yoga, call CSUF about my transcripts, and try to get a viewing of  Blockade  at UCLA's Film and Television archive... not necessarily in that order.  ***

      Ah... just made myself breakfast... or perhaps brunch? Well anyway... I made myself some french toast, with homemade blueberry topping, and a nice large side of hashbrowns. So my stomach is feeling good right now. Nothing really excited planned for today... I'll probably do more research and try to catch  Scorpion King  with Jon and maybe Brandon if he's available.  Today's plan is relatively similar to yesterday's in which I researched and then hung out with Jenny. Seem's like research always has to come first these days... how exciting.   Oh yea... that sand sculpture in Gateway Commons at UCI is simply awesome.  In rotation right now is some  Lars Frederiksen & The Bastards ' self-titled (2001).  ***

      The day's starting off kind... bleh... I discovered that my email invitations to my keg thing last weekend didn't make it to the hotmail addresses due to the stupidity of cox.net, I got a 0 on part 1b of my Soc Sci 3a assignment, and my grandmother died.  If I end up going to my grandmother's funeral in Taiwan, then I might be missing that free Unwritten Law show. Lose money from working, and set my research back a bit.  I also had to track down resources on the movie  Blockade  (1938). It looks like I'm going to be focusing my research on  Blockade  rather than lots of different movies due to the fact that I'm limited on time for this assignment... I have aproximately 3 weeks to get a solid draft done and research wise... I have maybe 15% of the necessary research done to do a 15-20 page paper.  Playing right now is  Bad Religion 's "Along the Way" from their  80-85  compilation. It's a nice punk rock funeral march.  ***

      Ah... nothing like a nice shower after being covered in the sweat of punks and skanks at a show...  Man... the show was awesome. It's been a good four years since I've seen  Rancid  and  NOFX ... so it was great to see them live. Their sets were pretty good except for NOFX going a little overboard on their slow satirical jazzy reggae style songs. The Real McKenzies were cool too. I'm totally down for bagpipe punk in the same vein of the  Dropkick Murphys . F-Minus wasn't very good though. It was also cool in the NOFX covered Rancid's "Olympia, WA" and Rancid covered NOFX's "Bob." Tim Armstrong had this big grin on his face and even chuckled a bit during that song. It was pretty cool.   If a certain Canadian friend of my is reading this, she must be foaming with jealousy over such a great show. I bet that'd be kicked up a few notches when I tell her that Unwritten Law is playing next Friday at my school for free! I just found that out today.   In other news not completely involving music, although it was an epiphany in bettwen NOFX's and Rancid's set... I realized my life is right where I want it to be. Going to awesome shows with good friends, doing really fun research at school (despite the headaches of being in the library too long), having fun and drinking with the boys (and sometimes girls), watching TV shows I like, art projects, etc. Life is good.   ****

      A totally interesting day!   I started the day off with a good response from my art project in Studio Art 65b. One of my business cards had a big middle finger with the letters FU next to it. If you know my real name then you know where FU comes from, beside the analogous meaning to the middle finger. That really got a good response. I also got a good response on my flaming name. It's nice to be appreciated!  I also realized that my ex's best friend's ex was in the class. Even stranger is that I ran into my ex while doing research at the library. It was weird. We talked a bit and I helped with her homework (the girl still attracts bad luck like a voodoo curse!). That was just weird seeing her again.   Anyway after that I went to work. I made a phone call to 94.3 to request some  T(I)NC . I didn't hear it played, but the D.J. seemed really interested in the band. She said she would see if she could play it. That's all I can ask for anyway.   Work was actually pretty productive. I scheduled a lot of really tough faults and managed to do really well in Minesweeper. I got it down to one mine on the intermediate level!  I'm totally stoked for the  Rancid  /  NOFX  show tomorrow night! Good friends, good show, good fun!  ***

      It was a business as usual day today. I was barely able to drag myself out of bed for my 9:30 AM statistics class. Then after class I did some research in the library. The research was interesting and fun, but library research for any extended length of time gives me a headache... I went home for lunch, took a nap, and then went to work. It's cool at work, we went back to the making sandwiches thing. It saves money, is healthy, and gives us an excuse to take a massive long break so that rules.  Just did some more research... I'm assuming that there's a massive difference between "motion picture" and "videorecording." I'm going to have to talk to a librarian about that. I hope it doesn't mean I've got to watch a movie via projector? I don't want to drive all the way to UCLA for something I can't use!  The song of the moment is "Walk Among Us" by the  Misfits  from their  Walk Among Us  CD (1982).  ***

      Totally didn't finish the keg last night. 11 people came by to help and it was futile. It was fun trying though. A lot of beer was drunk! It was lots of fun in that it seemed like everyone there knew someon that knew someone. That made for good coversation and fun.  There was some crazy shit across the street though. There was a party across the street... loud music, the smell of weed, drunk kids... that's right kids! Actually that's not that crazy unless you take into the account that the parents were there hosting all of it. It's crazy that the parents let the kids get stoned and drunk. I mean the birthday girl was messed up!  ***

      Cool I went to the Mission San Juan Capistrano, got some  Face to Face  tickets, downloaded some  Manic Hispanic , and I'm going to go pick up my keg from Beverages and More after I get something to eat.  The mission was cool. It wasn't as impressive as anything I saw in Europe, and wasn't nearly as impressive as when I was a kid in elementary school.   Dude!  Manic Hispanic  is fucking hilarious. They are basically a punk cover band, but they put a SoCal Mexican twist on the songs they cover. For example,  Rancid 's "Ruby Soho," becomes "Rudy Cholo" and the  Descendents'  "Der Weinerschnitzel" becomes "Alberto's." This is funny stuff. I need to show this stuff to Brandon. He'd totally get a kick out of this. This also great because the band is from O.C. and has members from such history making groups such as  Agent Orange .  ***

      I'm doing some major MP3 organizing right now. I've had  Bigwig 's  Invitiation to Tragedy ,  Lars Fredericksen & the Bastards , and  Guttermouth 's  Covered With Ants  sitting on my drive for a while, but it's only now that I've ID3-ed them and put them into my main MP3 directory.  I'm currently at 2299 MP3s fully ID3-ed. That includes artist name, album, track #, year released, and album cover art. I'm like totally anal like that. But hey... with that many MP3s you need to be organized.   I'm kind of irratated that when I desinstalled Morpheus that I accidently removed my download directory. That really set things back in that I had some  Black Sabbath ,  Skid Row ,  Radiohead ,  Pulley , and  Down by Law  amongst other scattered songs in there. Now I need to redownload all that shit. Hopefully I can find it all again.  ***

      I just had a very heated debate with my mom earlier over the state of 3rd World / Developing Nations. I came away pretty offended by what she said and pissed off. I never really thought about my parents being conservative until now. The debate came about from my mom mentioning that my dad's friend who is in town is a factory owner in Vietnam. I said something about how I'm against the "slave" labor in factories all over the world. She said that she thought it was a good thing, because people can now work. She goes on to talk about how countries are corrupt and messed up because of the people. She believed that they should just get their acts together. That enraged me. To me it's attitudes and ignorance such as that, which helps to perpetuate the horrible situations that exist in many nations caused by imperialism (cultural, political, and economic). This was the same sort of anger that I felt after hearing ignorant people call up talk radio shows. The lack of understanding of historical developments in nations and the result of those developments keeps people from fully understanding why so many things in the world are the way that they are. Then they formulate ignorant rationales for why they are the way they are.  *

      Wow I discovered that  The Hives  will be on the  urlLink  Spiderman   soundtrack. That's pretty amazing. I remember when I saw  The (International) Noise Conspiracy  in the December, that The Hives said that everyone was going to be dancing to "Hate to Say I Told You So" six months later. Looks like their prediction is coming true. They were #5 on KROQ's Furious 5 at 9 last night. Did I mention I'm seeing them next month in San Diego? That's going to rock. They put on some of the best live shows ever!  Damn... Mr. Brett must be happy with this.   ***

Soc Sci 3A becoming a real class, heightened violence in the Middle East, bombs going off in Columbia, troops to the Phillipines, white cops killing more minorities, springing forward for daylight savings, idiots driving the wrong way on the freeway trying to kill people, perverted priests... the list goes on and on!

      Looks like I didn't get a chance to go to the gym today... instead I had KFC! I really think I'm starting to gain some major weight. I doubt I'll ever be fat, my metabolism and build will keep me from that; however, I need to keep an eye on my health. I really think that I should be lifting so that weight gain is in the form of muscle and not fat. Tomorrow I promise!  Concerning my productivity today... I've managed to get a lot of quotes into the javascript files for the page. That means on even months there won't be undefined quotes and images (unless I missed something). Basically I just need to look up like 4 more quotes to put into the odd month javascript file to have both odd and even months done. I feel kind of bad in that the "dead white guy" quotes greatly outnumber quotations from women and minorities. Damn society!  Song playing at the moment is "Fox" by  Millencolin  from their  Pennybridge Pioneers  CD (2000).  ***

I'm kind of pissed that Social Science 3A is now somewhat of a real class... research paper!? 3 paragraph proposal due Monday!? Stupid web assignments due Monday!? Damnit! They just had to turn it into a real class by the time I take it.  I need to get myself a copy of Adobe Illustrator to work on my projects for Arts 65b. That should be an easy class...  Hmm... what else do I need to do... oh yea... a 1 page research proposal fo History 192w...  Week 1 and already all these assignments... lovely stuff eh? Could be worse though.  ***

It's cool not having to buy any books, but it's not cool not having anything to do for an hour and a half every day at school. Killing time in the computer lab is out of question due to the time in question is sandwiched by computer lab time. I guess it's time to get creative.

I should probably put that energy into finally getting my statement of purposes for my last shot at grad school for next fall done... but I dunno...

      Not exactly the most productive of days... I woke up at like 2:30 PM... heh...  Well I did manage to get some painting done. I redid the sky on my Notre Dame painting... I think it looks a lot better now. I also started my Skakespeare's Birthplace painting. I got to use my new wash brush I purchased yesterday. It's so nice to paint with a new brush... I'd forgot how easy it is to do straight smooth lines! It's really my fault my old brushes suck though... I'm not exactly the most thorough of cleaners. That's why I didn't buy a good brush. I bought a cheapo brush. Maybe if I was richer I would get better ones... then again if I was richer... I'd buy better paints... oil painting is an expensive hobby!  I could really use a beer today... perhaps I'll call up the buds and have some with RAW.  ****

      That was a pretty good show tonight. I went with Kristine and Naomi to see the Hives down in San Diego.  We got there in the middle of the Reigning Sound's set. They're a pretty good band with a southern rock / blues type of garage sound. I liked it. The next band the Mooney Suzuki, was simply amazing on stage. I had downloaded some of their stuff earlier today to check them out. I wasn't impressed, but man their stage show is pure entertainment. Every member of the band was jumping up and down and crawling on stuff... even the drummer! The jam session between the lead singer and the rythm guitarist was jaw dropping. There was seriously electricity in the air when they played! The  Hives  was awesome too. It was a great set that featured a cool light up Hives sign... (although I think the =W= one looks cooler). My only issue was with them talking too much. They were only on stage 45 minutes... which is short for a headlining band, and the fact that they talked so much cut it shorter. They closed with my personal favorite "A.K.A.I.D.I.O.T."  Good fun!  ***

      Man I needed a break from all that writing...  Ok... I have 15.5 pages done of my paper. I basically have to write more about how people were waiting to see how  Blockade  does before passing judgement, a wrap up, and a conclusion. I think in the end the paper will be about 17 pages.  Nothing else is really new with me... I was only really annoyed this morning when I found out that the professor wasn't going to show up for my 9AM class. I basically woke up early for nothing! That really blew chunks.  I'm going to get myself some munchies and then finish my paper.  ***

Anyway... class was dull because I took the professor's research methods class before and it was pretty much the same stuff over again.  After class I went down to the Spectrum to make use of the Quicksilver gift certificate I got from wrestling. Man stuff is expensive there... oh well... I got myself a pair of shorts... a nice light pair with plenty of pockets... it'll be useful for when I go to shows. While I was at it, I picked up an  Anti-Flag  shirt from Hot Topic. I needed some new clothes anyway. I'm the type who doesn't get clothes unless I feel like I'm running out of clothes. This was about that time.  Time for lunch, a nap, and maybe some work on my paper before work...  **

      Awesome! I'm at at 13 pages completed for my paper! That's 86% completed. Well 86% assuming that I only do 15 pages. Right now I think I'll probably go over that. I still have to  Write about the Legion of Decency.  Go into more detail on the Left.  Write about the film's overall impact on Hollywood.  Do the conclusion.  Fine tune stuff... to make sure it all flows.  This all has to be done by Thursday at 3PM.  Oh yea... I'm seeing the  Hives  this weekend. I'm really looking forward to that. Those guys are awesome live. Much better than recorded... I've been saying that a lot about a lot of bands currently. Oh well... but that should be fun. I think that will pretty much end my concert goings until I go to Warped Tour.  Off to bed so I can make it to statistics tomorrow morning.  ***

      It’s 2:30 AM and I have class at 9. I’m either having a hard time going to sleep due to my 4 hours nap and the coffee I had, or due to having a lot on my mind. I’ve been reflecting a lot on who I am right now as opposed to who I was several years ago. I guess it’s fitting since I graduate in a few weeks. I’ve come to the realization that I’m much more cynical and foreboding now than I ever was in the past. I don’t really think that’s a good thing.  It’s a materialistic world out there. So I just stopped caring as a response. I’ve realized that and I find myself to be a cold individual right now as a result of that… or at least on the inside. I still go out and have fun with friends. I still enjoy life; however, on the inside… many of my desires and ideals have stopped burning brightly. I think that’s why the thought of an enduring romantic relationship seems ridiculous to me. That’s probably why I found that stuff in the films I’ve been watching to be meaningless. That’s probably why I’m feeling so apathetic right now about grad school and my future. I wouldn’t say that I’m pessimistic to the point of not having hope at all, but simply at this juncture, I have no lofty dreams like I did several years ago.   That’s pretty much my ramble. I should try to go to bed again.  *

      I did manage to go to the movies today. I watched  Episode II  and  Spiderman . Both were in my opinion extremely good movies. As for my brother's statement about  Spiderman  being better? That's arguable. To me both movies were so incredibly different that it's hard to compare. True both are familiar, science-fiction / action films; however, they serve different purposes. It's clear that  Episode II  is part of a larger series of movies. There's a lot of linking and tying in of plot and characters of what will be all 6 movies. That means there's a lot of stuff going on. Actually after watching it twice, I picked up on a lot of the linking stuff. It's almost overwhelming how much they pack in.  Spiderman  is one movie with a straighforward single plot. In a way I liked how  Episode II  kept me thinking and tying things together. However, I liked how  Spiderman  was just a great simple movie, that only briefly focused on how there could be sequel. Visually,  Episode II  was better; however, sometimes it did seem too much. I dunno... if it was a competition, I'd give it a tie.  Anyway... after the movies, Jon and I had some Del Taco and then I dropped him off. I pretty much went home and slept for 4 hours. Talk about a lazy ass eh? Well I did manage to catch 2nd hour of the finale of X-files, do my Soc Sci 3a stuff and get up to 10 pages done of my history paper. That's 66% done! Woohoo.  Things to do for tomorrow:  Go to class.  Turn in my Soc Sci 3a assignment  Get my insurance thing stamped.  Use my $25 gift certificate at Quicksilver... I'll probably get some shorts or something.  Go to yoga.  Work on my paper.  Watch RAW.    Hmm... I haven't been listening to much music lately so nothing in rotation for the past few days. I guess with my new spindle of CDs I should make myself a new CD.  ***

      I just finished watching a bootleg copy of  Episode II . I have to say that it was one bad ass movie. I can't believe my brother said  Spiderman  was better! That means I really need to get my ass out to go see it tomorrow. Yoda is incredibly bad ass in that movie. Mace Windu rules too. Anakin gets on my nerves though...  In other news... I had work today, bought some CD-Rs, and worked on my paper. I'm up to a solid 8 pages. That means 53% done.  Work wasn't too great. The big boss came in again! Weekends aren't cool anymore!  Stuff I need to do tomorrow:   Go to the movies.   Do Soc Sci 3a stuff.   Work on History paper.     Put in Valleau's anaylsis of  Blockade .   Write about the Knights of Columbus.   Go into the Legion of Decency and their rating.   Write about the Left.   Time to go to bed so I don't fall asleep in the theater!  ***

      Just got out of the shower after a long day...  I had statistics, statistics lab, time to kill, and history, and the  Alkaline Trio  concert.  Lots of good news today... I got a lot of acclaim for my intro and outline for my history paper in class today. Things like that are nice, because it's people who are technically colleagues that are in the same situation as you praising you.  Also  Alkaline Trio  at the Troubadour was pretty cool. The show opened with Dropkick Vietnam. They weren't very good, I've seen worse, but that fat lead singer with the cordless mic got on our nerves. It was also dumb of him to tell people to start moshing and then play a song with a slow intro, because the people got going and then stopped. All the heat was gone once the song go started, which isn't the way its supposed to work. Solea was pretty good. They have a Weezer, Jimmy Eat World or New Found Glory type of sound. It more rock than punk, but it was good stuff.  Alkaline Trio  played a great 1 hr set. I'll admit I'm not a big fan and I don't know all the words. I can only listen the titles of a couple of songs; however, they are significantly better live than recorded. They had a lot more energy in my opinion. All in all it good fun.  My only gripe about seeing these up and coming bands is the teenagers at the shows. I don't have a problem with most, but it seems to me there are always these "kids" who are total dicks in the pit. It's a given when you're in the pit, it's going to be rough and people push people around. That means when you get pushed it doesn't mean anything. It's all in good fun. However, these "kids" think you're starting shit or try to start shit and go back after you. I've only noticed this recently from the younger crowd. At shows such as  Bad Religion ,  Rancid , and  TSOL  with an older fan base, I get a stronger vibe of respect and appreciation of the music and one another. This show, and  Face to Face  last weekend had younger crowds... even Face to Face is an older band... and those little kids were little punk asses that I just wanted to beat down. I know I sound all old and conersvative when I say that I blame all this nu-metal stuff that floating around. All this empty anger and these kids go to shows with these attitudes from it... empty anger... wanting to start shit... I need to find more 18+ or 21+ venues.  ***

      No class today... it's nice to sleep in... damn the connection to my bro's comp keeps breaking, so I couldn't get Episode II. That blows... I guess I'll have to watch it in the theaters like normal people.  It was another non eventful day... I went to Olive Garden with Jenny for lunch today. Wine and pasta was a nice change from my pub food and beer. That was probably the highlight of my day. I think the second highlight was trying those mint things that Ozzy tried... those thin sheets... Thelma had some at work and I tried one. It was weird. It didn't taste too good either, but it did freshen my wine breath up.  Woohoo going to see  Alkaline Trio  tomorrow night. Good stuff!  ***

      Not a really exciting day today. Class... home to sleep... work...  I'm up to 7 pages of my paper, which is 46%. I need to write more about:   The lack of politics in the film.   The Knights of Columbus.   The left's perceptions of the film.   The the popular press's views of the film.   The role of movie censorship.    In rotation right now is some  Pennywise .  ***

      My god RAW sucked! Booker T in nWo!? You might as well call it Team WCW or something like that. Hell... they didn't even need Hall and Nash to make it. RAW is so WCW right now it isn't even funny.  Anyway, I'm 40% through with my paper... 6 pages done!   I also managed to chit chat with my Canadian buddy and her pals until kind of late... sleep is a rare commodity these days.  ***

      Man... I've been feeling like crap, but I think it's because I keep going out. Last night I went to Dave and Busters with Alex for a couple of drinks. I didn't get home until past 12... then I was dumb and didn't go to sleep until 3. That's with me having to drag my ass to class by 9 AM... The good news is that the instructor cancelled class for Wednesday! Good stuff!  Oh yea, in other good news... I was distracted from outside during yoga today, because in the room we use at the ARC... you can look right down into the pool and there was a chick wearing a thong... flaunting her assets. It's things like this that make life just a little better!  Ok... things I need to get done in the next few days are:   Work on my history paper.   Do my stats homework.   Work out.    Now for some  RAW  featuring Brock Lesnar, Goldust, and Booker T... the highlights of the show!  ***

      Wow yesterday was busy! I woke up around 9 AM... which is extremely early for me on a Saturday. I made my potato, egg, and smoothie breakfast and was off to school to do research. I found some nice stuff on how much money  Blockade  made in  Variety . It's kind of confusing, but it's interesting for my paper. There's one thing on Radio City Music Hall that was really interesting. Oh yea... I found out that Edwards Theaters here in So Cal was one of the first to only show one movie at a time in a lot of different rooms. That was kind of neat little fact.   After that, I went to listen to my friend Stephanie's presentation on her research on cosmetics of the 18th century. It was pretty good. The poor girl ran out of time. I could tell she had a lot of stuff to present, but didn't get a chance to due to time constraints. It was cool, and the other presentations were cool too. After that myself, and all my lady friends from Cambridge went to In N Out. It's always cool hanging out with them.  We parted ways soon after eating, and I had to go to the Engineering Gateway to finish up my art project and then to Kinkos to print it out. I then went home and relaxed a bit and chatted with my buddy Flo until I had to go pick up my pals for  Face to Face .  First of all we were extremely annoyed by the $15 valet parking we were forced to pay. That was the first time I ever used valet and it was not the convience that it should have been. Very irritating! I had to wait forever to get my car back after the show!  Anyway... we got there at the end of Midtown's set. We didn't really want to see any of the opening acts anyway. So it wasn't long until  Face to Face  took the stage. That was a really good show. The band isn't exactly one of my favorites, but it's one band where I just wanted to at least see them once. However, they played a good set. They played stuff from their new album, which I think is pretty good. Their cover of  Descendents ' "Bikeage" was great. Also the crowd went crazy when "Disconnected" played about 5 songs in. It was fun night out with the posse so it was fun. Afterwards we went over to Brandon's and had some Del Taco and beer while watching  Rumble in the Bronx .  Heh I'm writing this almost right after I woke up... past 2PM... this is going to be a productive day...  ****

      Man I had such a headache when I got back from the Herrick Library. It was a really useful visit though. I managed to get a lot from the  Motion Picture Hearld . Plenty of articles were printed from microfilm! I'll probably go back for their special collections stuff on  Blockade  sometime soon. I have my paper pretty laid out now. I have about 4.5 pages done. Good stuff... the bad news was the 2 hour drive back with a splitting headache. I managed to make it home, take some excedrin and rest until I went to the wrestling banquet. It was cool. Although the video stuff dragged on toward the end.   **

      A pretty good day, despite being a bit ill. I had art class and it looks like I need to hurry up and get that art project done soon, so I can get it printed by Monday... After that I went home and slept. Went to work and then went to Dave and Busters with Naomi and Janet to celebrate Naomi's birthday. It was fun. I have a extremely packed next couple of days. Tomorrow, I have class, need to go to do research, and go to the wrestling banquest. Friday I have work. Saturday, I have to go take a look at the stuff I just ordered on interlibrary loan, and see  Face to Face . I need to squeeze in art as mentioned earlier, working out, working on my paper, and maybe swing by Steff's presentation.   Lots to do eh?  ***

      Cool... I managed to get copies of stuff on  Blockade  from the  Catholic Worker  and  The Nation  and I'm going to get stuff from the  Motion Picture Hearld  on Thursday from the Herrick Library. My paper is progress really well and I'm having fun with it.  Things I need to work on my paper:   The production of the movie.   Write more on the story and plot.   I need to work more on the Catholic far-right's attitudes on the film. I've pretty much done it all for the Catholic left and center already.   Work on the Left's attitudes more. I've got some stuff done though. More is needed.   Write up stuff on general criticisms of the film in the mainstream media. That should be kind of complicated, seeing is how I have so much stuff.   Write about what's going on in the movie industry at the time. Trusts and censorship as limiting factors of controversial themes in films.   Conclusions and thoughts.    There's still a lot to do as you can see. That's so easily an additional 9 pages. Most likely it will be more.  In rotation right now is  Nerd Herder 's  How To Meet Girls  (2001).  ****

      Things got a bit more productive towards the end of the day. As those of you that frequent my site may have noticed, I have a new "band of the month" thing. It's pretty much a blatant rip off of what a certain Canadian friend of mine has on her page. The javascripting for it still needs some work, but the basics have been laid out for it, which is a good thing.  In addition to that burst of creativity, I got more of my history paper done. I've titled it  Watching the Right, the Left, and the Center in “Blockade” . The title is play on a song by  Anti-Flag  from their  Underground Network  album (2001). I have about 4 pages done, counting the title page.... counting just the body portion of the paper... I'm about 20% through with it... that's assuming I just do the minimum 15 pages. I could always potentially go over that length in the body depending on what I cram into the paper.  I should go to bed.  ***

      Nothing exciting today either. Class... and I worked out a lot. I ran, did yoga, and then lifted. That's pretty much it.  I can't believe that the WWF is now WWE. That's just so wrong. Damn the World Wildlife Fund.  ***

      Wow... what a horribly uneventful day. I woke up around 1 PM, made myself breakfast around 1:30 PM and then did who knows what for hours until I managed to catch some TV. Well I did manage to put my lame ass Social Science 3A web assignment up on my EA account, and tag my  Pulley  and  Alkaline Trio  mp3s.  **

      Cool I have 2 pages of my research paper written up. I figured that I should start writing my paper up. Sure I still need to take a look at a few more sources, but I pretty much know what I want to write about... so I'm getting started now. The paper is supposed to be 15-20 pages. I figure with that the non-body portions is already going to be about an additional 4-5 pages... so it could potentially exceed that.  I think that tomorrow... I'm going to work more on my paper, this webpage, and my art projects.  In rotation right now is  Skid Row 's  Slave To The Grind  (1991) and  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief  (2002).  ***

      Lovely... another headache from too much time at the library. It was cool going through issues of  Newsweek  and  Time  from 1938 though. There lots of nifty advertisements from that decade. I thought this motor oil ad was hilarious and wrong at the same time. It just looks weird with a dad and his kid sitting on their car watching soldiers go by.  I did manage to pick up Alkaline Trio tickets for the 16th at the Troubadour. That should be fun and entertaining.  I'm kind of hungry right now. I'm think I'll get something to eat.  **

I wonder if its because I've been working out and my body is adjusting to the activity level. Not really sure...  The song playing right now is  R.E.M.

      I've heard from various people that CSUF is one of the most disorganized schools around... I called them up and apparently they fucked up my social security number and haven't processed my transcripts yet. If I don't get into their school, I'm going to be pissed!  Man... that statistics midterm was almost too easy. I was done with the exam in about 15 minutes. I was sitting around checking to see if anyone turned in their exam yet... I think I was the first one done. I don't like turning in my exam first, because I feel weird... especially since I was done that quick... let's hope it really was easy! When exams are too easy I get nervous... oh yea.. this is my last midterm exam ever! Woohoo!  In rotation right now is  Screeching Weasel 's  My Brain Hurts  (1991).  ***

      Busy day today at work, the only breather I got was when the bosses went to check out the protesters down the street and the cops in riot gear...  Afterwork I got some Fuddruckers with George and then talked to Jenny on the way home. I then did my note card for my midterm in the morning. I'm feeling kind of tired. A lot of stuff went on today.  On my list of things to do tomorrow are:     Check to see if CSUF got my transcripts.     Call the Herrick Library to see if they have the  Motion Picture Hearld .     Write up my 1 page progress report on my research.     Be in Janet's friend's video.   The song of the moment before I go to bed is "Island in the Sun" by  Weezer  from their  Green  album (2001).  ***

      Hmm... looks like I need to get the quote of the day stuff up for odd months...  Nothing particularly exciting today... thus far... I had my digital arts class and realized that I need to do my project mostly in illustrator due to the largeness of the project. I really don't want to deal with 50 MB psd files. I went to the library and discovered that we don't have issues of  New Masses  between 1932-1934, despite having all the other years. Talk about lame. After that I worked out, chit chatted with two friends named Eric and now I'm enjoying a smoothie and Jeno's pizza.  Oh yea my little brother is transferring from UCSC to UCI. Good stuff... perhaps...  In rotation right now is  Bigwig 's  Invitation To Tragedy  (2001), and  Propagandhi 's  Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes  (2001).  ***

      Well I went up to Hollywood to watch  Blockade . It was kind of cool going all the way up there to go see it. Sure traffic coming back was kind of annoying, but it was a cool experience. I'm really having fun with this research. This is my first time really doing real history research and I'm having fun with it. Being able to research whatever you want is great. Although it is getting harder locating primary documents for this paper. I have 2 pages so far for my biliography and about 7 pages worth of typed up notes. I wonder how much more I need. I know I need to explore more of the right's perspective on films. I also have to look into subjects such as censorship and more on the Spanish civil war.  Aside from that nothing really exciting. I had lunch with Mark at the pub and as usual when we have lunch, we talk politics. Good stuff.  ****

      I just have to write something about the whole 9th Circuit Court's ruling on the Pledge of Allegiance. I believe the 9th Circuit's decision is not about purging the nation of religious expression, nor anti-patriotism. To me the issue is making the Pledge of the Allegiance inclusive of believers and non-believers. My reaction to the public outcry was similar to that of my impressions of the outcry after 9/11... either the media only lets ignorant people voice their opinions, or the public in general is ignorant. The things people say! I swear! Some people are so caught up in their religious or political beliefs that they ignore that there are other opinions and beliefs out there. Don't get me started on all the people that say that this nation was founded and is successful because of God. We live in a multicultural nation and world that encompasses different religions, political ideals, and cultures. If the United States is supposed to be the pinnacle of multiculturalism, then our government and unfortunately many of our citizens' attitudes don't mirror that image.  *

      An even earlier rise this morning... 8:45 AM... the difference is I'm meeting Jenny for brunch later. We'll probably hangout a bit before I eventually go to work at 4 PM.  In other news of me getting out and about, Linda invited me to go to a bar on Friday night. That was a truly tempting offer, but with work Saturday morning and the fact I'll be going to the SD County fair with girls from Cambridge right after that... I don't wanna run myself into the ground. The fair should be fun, as hanging out with them usually is. Too bad it's not on a later date, because there's a date which features the Honky Tonk Man, Konnan, and Evan Karagias. Hah... Konnan. I was actually a fan of him. Brandon used to joke about how funny it would be to see Konnan and El Cholo (from a local lucha libre federation) wrestle.  ***

      I got up earlier than usual... 10 AM. I managed to check up on my financial aid stuff... which yielded good results. Everything is in and I'll be getting paperwork in a couple of weeks. I also managed to go for a little run this morning as well. 2 days in a row of jogging! Can I keep it up? It's been years since I last ran that little trail. The last time was my senior year of high school. I've ran since then, but usually on an indoor track or on a treadmill... I think that's why my knees are feeling it more now. I'm not used to the punishment of running on the road anymore.  My plans for the rest of today are to call the UCI Registrar, go to the bank, and then go to work. I should try to get some painting done tonight too. Hmm... should I have a slurpee today?  ***

I discovered that at the  Alkaline Trio  show last month. Man... I need to know if there are any good punk venues in Binghamton. Going to shows is so what I do for fun! I can't imagine that being gone!  Man... I slept for like 12 hrs... now I'm up... with 3 hrs before work. What should I do?  ***

      Awe bummer... no one wants to go see  Weezer  with me in August. It is kind of expensive and in a large venue though. I don't blame them. I haven't seen them in a while though. If I don't hear from anyone by the time of the presale, I'm not going. I want to be down in the pit.  In other concert news... the  Ataris  are playing 4 shows at Chain Reaction. I have to go see that. That's the SoCal punk rock experience epitomized. A pretty good band playing a tiny little venue. That'll be great show guaranteed.   Hmm... I was gonna hang out with Jenny today, but she forgot about other plans... looks like WWE Raw is in my near future instead.  ***

      Here I am on day 3 in Binghamton. Once again I'm at the computer lab killing time. I basically have about 13 hrs to kill before my flight back to lovely O.C. tomorrow morning. I'll probably kill as much time here as possible before I head back to the hotel. I am such a computer/internet addict aren't I? I need to be around a computer almost every day! Something that's kind of annoying is that I get roughly 20 emails a day... most of them are just bullshit spam emails though. That basically means that if I don't check my email frequently, then my inbox is going to get overloaded. That simply wouldn't be cool.  My final grades are in now at UCI... I wonder if I should waste my money and call? I have no idea how much the roaming fees are. That kind of sucks... but I guess if I get bored enough I'll call.   Stuff to do in the upcoming week... besides working that is... I'll call Jimmy up when I get back. Hopefully we can hang out before he goes back home to the bay area. I'll also try to have lunch with Dan, and hang out with Jenny sometime in the week too. I'll also need to call up Minh-An about going to MOCA. In addition to that... I need to find out if anyone wants to go to the Weezer show in August.  Speaking of Weezer... the "Keep Fishing" video is going to feature the Muppets! How cool is that? I personally thought the videos from he  Green Album  were a disappointment. I'm also kind of bitter about them cancelling the show in Manchester, UK to film that horrible "Island in the Sun" video. It's tough to compete with the originality of the "Buddy Holly" video. I totally dig the "Dope Nose" video though... I mean come on! how can you compete with Japanese biker gangs? I guess the Muppets can!  ***

      Well here I am in Binghamton University's computer lab...   I arrived here Wednesday night and took a cab to my hotel and pretty much did nothing that night. Yesterday I checked out the campus, paid the sociology department a visit and got an apartment. Which was the highlight of my trip so far. I have a place to live! Woohoo! Today I just took a tour of the campus and now I'm killing time in a computer lab. I have no idea what I'm going to do tonight or all day tomorrow... probably kill time at the mall.  I think life will be more exciting once I know the area and make friends.  ***

      Man... I've been having some majorly trippy dreams for the past week or two. Last night there was a fundamentalist speaker at graduation in my dream. There was the dream that made me wonder if I had woke up earlier and made some phone calls and went to bed. There were also the pornographic ones and the ones where I overhear people talking about me. Then there was the really deep dream that I had in the middle of last week. A character in the dream, who was supposed to be a boss of mine, was crying that she wasn't real. Her words were "you don't know how it feels to know you're just a character in a dream." That was the most trippy!   Man... the notion of not being real and just being a character in a dream? It's nothing new, there are those Star Trek holodeck episodes, where the characters "wake up" to their situation. Or the episode of Growing Pains when Ben discovers he's a character in a TV show. Stuff like this really makes me tread the line between atheist and agnostic. The notion of something unifying the plots of our lives, but if that were true it takes away from our own power as individuals. I'm too hungry to continue dwelling on this. Time for breakfast / lunch.  ***

      Today was a pretty cool day. Naomi and I did manage to meet up with Steff and her friends and it was really cool. It was really crazy actually. Steff is friends with people I haven't seen in like 10 years. Not to mentioning me getting her wine for her birthday and she got me whiskey for mine. Heh.. her friends were joking about how we basically swapped booze. Man... she and I have too many coincidences... makes you really think about that horoscope stuff eh?  Anyway... I get to sleep in tomorrow and work the evening shift. I also need to pack for my flight tomorrow too.  *****

      Wow... my it was odd this morning knowing that I don't have to think about school! Anyway I was majorly late to work today, because I forgot to set my alarm and due to traffic. Work was whatever... afterwards I met up with Julia and Naomi and hung out at the Block. We're supposed to meet up with Steff and her friends later. Good stuff.  I realized something today... I want to be more knowledgable about wine. I know beer decently right now. I think I should learn about wine... it's something classy and can make me look cool. Well aside from the vanity thing... I'll know what to drink. Maybe that'll be some reading material on the plane?  Oh yea... I got  Anti-Flag 's  Mobilize  (2002). I finally used my Virgin Records gift card I got for Christmas. So... the CD was pretty much free. It's cool cause it's 2 cds too!  ****

      Well I graduated yesterday and it's my birthday today!   Graduation was... alright.. it had its moments like me with an FU on my cap and me doing the RVD pointing thing on stage infront of thousands of people. Heh... I even gave the dean a high-five. That was fun. It was just a long ass ceremony. Afterwards my family and I went out to eat and after that I went to a little get together with Janet, Julia, Andy, and Janet's friends. The result of that... let's just say sushi, japanese beer, Jose Cuervo, Smirnoff Ice, and a shot of really cheap vodka is not good on your stomach.  Hmm...what to do today?  ***

      Woohoo graduating today!  Last night there was a little Shadowfax reunion. It was really cool to see the old familiar faces again. It's hard to believe 4 years have passed since we all lived together in Middle Earth. Now we're almost all graduating, or graduated. It was a bit surreal walking through Middle Earth to meet up with some of the folks... since I instantly thought about what it was like when I first got to UCI. Anyway... we all ended up going to BJ's and then hung out at Hoa's. It was really cool.  I wonder if I should get a haircut before graduation tonight?  ***

I'll be meeting up with Mike tomorrow at the pub for lunch... that should be cool... a nice beer from the pub.  ***

      What a day! I made some phone calls this morning to NY. I watched  Requiem for a Dream . Turned in my Soc Sci 3A paper, and picked up my humanities tassel on campus. Then I had work. Then I finished my history paper. It's a nice 25 pages total with title page, body, and bibliography. Man... I have 2.5 pages worth of bibliography in size 10 Times New Roman font. That's massive research. I might scan through it a few more times tomorrow and then print the sucker at work tomorrow night. I may or may not do a totally final check up on campus on Thursday before I turn it in.   I wonder what I should do now at 2 AM?  ***

      I just watched  Evolution . Not that great of a movie. I'm kind of glad I missed wasting my money in the theaters on it. It killed time though. Now that I think about it... I'm finally catching up on the movies from last summer that I missed due to being in Europe. It's nice to catch up.  ***

      I had work this morning at 8:30 AM... picked up my cap and gown... watched the  The Fast and the Furious ... took a nap... finished my social science paper... and then watched RAW. A pretty productive day! It's only 11:43 PM, but it feels like it's way later.  Tomorrow I need to make some phone calls, turn in my paper, pick up my Humanities tassel, go to work, and then work on my note card for my stats final. It seems like I'll be pretty busy the whole week!   My plans for Wednesday are to work and finish my history paper. Thursday I have my final final for stats. I also plan on turning in my history paper that day. As for Friday, I have work in the morning, I need to pick up my blue cord for being in an honor society, and then I'm going out to eat with the Shadowfaxians from freshmen year. That should be a fun reunion!  ***

      Cool... ending the night at 72% That means only 28% left to go. That should be a cinch due to the analysis of the data and the conclusion isn't done yet. Hmm... it's 1:43 AM and I have work at 8:30... lovely stuff. Tomorrow I need to get my cap and gown too. I'll do that after work. Man... it's crazy... in one week it's all done!  ***

      Cool... at 1350 words done out of 2500, that means 54% completed with my social science paper. I also managed to watch  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back  earlier too. That was a good movie. The Scooby Doo spoof was funny. Somehow I doubt they'll be making any jokes about Velma and Fred being gay in the upcoming movie. Heh... I really dig the things Cartoon Network did with them too.  Anyway.. a shower and then back to work.  ***

      Ok... I got up to about 28% of my paper last night... after some major computer problems...I need to get up to maybe about 70%? today. That shouldn't be too hard if I stick a bunch of charts into the paper. My paper is going to be so lame. Quantative analysis is so not my thing... the less I do in grad school the better!   Things to do today:  Eat.  Work on my paper.  Maybe watch one of my bro's pirated movies.  Eat more.  Work on my paper more.  Sounds like a plan! I'm gonna get going on it now!  Oh yea... in rotation recently has been  Ten Foot Pole , which I'm not going to see in a few weeks. Damn saving money!  ***

      Kind of an interesting day. I went to my digital arts class...so now it's finally over. I got a good response for my art project. I think it's because I put some thought into the content of my work, rather than just make something cute or funny. After that I went home for a nap, and then went to work. Work was long, but cool. Julia, George, Samantha and I all joked around and watched the Laker game, which made the night more bearable. Afterwards, I made it to the short film festival at UCI and met up with Naomi, Julia ( a different one ), Steff, and Janet. Now I'm at home sweet home ready for some relaxation.  ***

      Nothing really new with me except I've been fatigued lately. I don't know what it is. I just haven't had a lot of energy.  The end is near... it's crazy... I'm only months away from being in upstate New York for school! Crazy stuff.  ***

      I just had a good time hanging out with the girls from Cambridge. We went to the screenwriting festival that Janet was involved in and then came over to my place just to hang out. The only bummer was with Steff, because she had issues with someone, so she took off. We were a bit worried about her, but she called us back saying things were cool. All in all it was very cool as it usually is when hanging out with friends.   My plans for tomorrow... er today... are work on my history paper and get some stuff started for my Social Science 3a paper. I need to book a flight out to Binghamton on Monday and make some more calls. That's basically my schedule for the next 2 days.  Life is good right now. Full of celebration of the end!  ***

      I have a solid 18 pages written for the final draft of my history paper. I need to go through the last few pages and fix some errors and then redo the ending a bit. I think in the end the paper will be 22 pages including the works cited and title page.  ***

      Hmm... my day? I paid some bills and tried to exchange my cell for a different one, but the dude that needed to be there for it wasn't there... so I'm going back again tomorrow. It's kind of annoying since I'll have gone to that shop 4 days in row. Work was whatever. I wasn't very motivated today. It's hard to stay motivated when you know you aren't going to be with the company much longer. I did some reading for grad school tonight too. It's a short essay by R.H. Hilton on the medieval economy. It seems most of the stuff I'm reading for 601 is on the medieval economy and the transition from feudalism to capitalism. It's mainly stuff on historiography and economics. It's not really what I expected to be reading for a graduate degree in sociology, but it's cool stuff. I love the fact that my sociology department is so inter- or as Prof. Lee put it, pan-disciplinary. I'm just hoping that I can avoid statistics.  Songs that have been in rotation recently have been the Sahara Hotnights' "On Top of Your World," Big Country's "In A Big Country," Dexy's Midnight Runners' "Come Eileen," and the Ataris' "1-15-96."  The days have seem really long lately.  **

      Work today was the same as usual... except for the fact I sat at the San Diego computer rather that at Amanda's desk today. It was to give Samantha a break from being stuck working in the same room with Margarita, and for a slight change of scenary. I don't think old Margarita is willing to treat me like she does Samantha because she knows I don't take her crap as readily as Samantha...  In other news, my family and I got new cell phones. I got a Motorola v66 for myself, but tomorrow I'm going to try to go back and trade it in for the cheaper, but way cooler Samsung R225. The Motorola is cool, but I don't like the menu system and I don't think I'll use as many of the functions. So in the end I should get a lot of money back and get a cooler phone.  Also I've decided to go eat with Naomi this weekend, because according to my nifty MS Outlook, it's her birthday this weekend. Looks like in addition to that, we'll be getting family portraits this weekend too. Time to get the shirt and tie out again.  ***

      The weekend is over and I have to go to work in a few minutes...  My weekend was alright... it seemed long. I think it's because I spent most of it awake, which is unusual for me. Starting Friday night, I was up and out late. I didn't get home until 4 AM Saturday morning from hanging out with Flo and her friends. Then I had work at 9 AM. After work, my mom and I went to go check out cell phone plans and grocery shopping. I did manage to sneak in a nap after dinner, but then I was up watching stupid TV shows like French in Action until 3 AM. Sunday I photocopied readings and checked out some more cell phone plans. Then I was up chatting and stuff un 2 AM. That's not a lot of sleep when you have work at 8:30 AM. So now on to another week of jobbing. I do have the opportunity to have fun this weekend. Either a BBQ with Flo or Ethiopian food with Naomi on Saturday. Decisions... decisions.  ***

      Ah yes... a day without work... a day to rejuvenate the mind and spirit. So far nothing really exciting. Last night I did some reading, while enjoying my wine. I also did some chatting with Flo and played some Age of Empires. I really need a new game to play...  Today I woke up around noon, made lunch for myself and my brother, then went to the bookstore and washed my car. I also ordered a book on-line. Not really sure what else I'm going to do until I watch Smackdown with the posse.  ***

The only benefit is being able to squeeze in more hours and I could use the money.   I also booked my flight out to Binghamton today. I leave Irvine on the 28th of August. That's only a little over a month away... A lot of people have been asking me if I'm excited. I don't know what it is I feel. I'm not exactly an exciteable person. I am looking forward to a new life as a graduate student though.  In rotation today is  Bad Religion 's  Process of Belief .  ***

      It's been a good weekend. Yesterday I went to the Andy Warhol exhibit at MOCA with Julia and Naomi. It was quite a good exhibit. I've never seen so much art from one artist before. They had everything from Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy, Chairman Mao, to Elvis in addition to soup cans. Afterwards we met up with Janet and Flo to go to Citywalk. Citywalk... is... pretty much like any of the other outdoor malls here in southern California... such as Downtown Disney, Spectrum and the Block. It just has what I guess is a "hipper" vibe since it's quite a destination for people in the Los Angeles ADI. I hadn't been there in about 2 years, and it's still just as crowded. We had some good Italian food at Bucca di Beppo and it was quite fun hanging out with my female posse as it always is. As Suzanne commented on not too long ago, I have a lot of female friends. It's cool though. These girls are enough like my buds of the "Irvine Posse" from high school, that it's always cool just hanging out. Of course things are slightly different being they're all girls and I'm the only guy in the group, but I never feel out of place.   Today, was relaxation for most of the day and eating leftovers from Bucca di Beppo. My "Irvine Posse" did come over so we could watch the WWE PPV. We had some fine, but cheap beers such Quilmes from Argentina and various versions of Eureka beer. It was lots of hanging out and talking, the PPV was mostly a background thing... the good thing is it was free thanks to Derek's box. From what I remember of the PPV, it was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular though. I found the DX chants from the audience when HBK came out to talk to Triple H amusing. Goldust and Booker is always funny. Bischoff is just such a heel, he's great in an annoying way.  Tomorrow I have work, I don't know if I'm supposed to go in at 8 or 8:30 AM... I think it will ultimately depend on when I wake up.  ****

      Man... I was playing with the camera I got for my brother last year and took a few quick snaps of myself... I look totally different from how I did just a few months ago. More like 2 months ago! Just take a look in the photo section. Compare the picture of me back in May to the recent ones of me from July. Facial hair and a less hair can make such a big difference!  Well Julia should be hear any time now for us to see some soup cans and Elvi.  ***

      I'm feeling like a lazy ass right now. I'm almost tempted to go to sleep early rather than go hang out with friends. Working from 8AM to 2:45PM will do that to you. That's almost 7 hours being couped up in an office.  Looks like Verizon cancelled my phone line order, because of some stupid thing where you have to order your phone line within 30 days of the activation date. I also need to get around to canceling my Cingular cell phone, and order a Verizon National Plan. Seeing as how I'll be travelling from coast to coast relatively often, I'll need that.  Tomorrow I'm going to go to MOCA with Julia and Naomi, and then we're going meet up with Janet for dinner. Man! I've spent a lot of money this week. I guess I've been jobbing a lot, but I really need that money for when school starts and to buy a laptop.  Anyway... after listening to the new  Weezer  stuff some more... these are the songs I'm digging... Superstar, Private Message, Untenable and Fontana.  ***

      I have no idea why I'm still up. I tried to go to bed, but I couldn't. You would think that with only 3 hours of sleep last night, that I would just collapse tonight. I guess I have a lot on my mind. It's more contemplative than anything though... stuff like reflecting on my life. Truthfully... when I look back at events from the past month or two... or maybe even back to a year... it feels like part of my life is coming full circle and that chapter is closing. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just something that really makes me think. Although it's interesting stuff that I'm thinking about, sleep would be nice.  ***

      I got another keg last night. The same stuff as last time. The difference was it went flat fast and didn't seem as strong. Derek suggested that it was tapped bad. That's probably the reason why we didn't finish again! I had double the amount of people too! It also had to do with the little BBQ I had in my backyard. All the burgers and hotdogs took up valuable stomach space. But it was a cool little party. About 20 of my very good friends sitting around eating, drinking, and watching movies.   Today I just relaxed all day and did nothing. So it was a good weekend. Now I get to look forward to a week of working at 8 AM.  ***

      Hmm... I've noticed that I paint better when I have some alcohol in me. It just seems to flow better... although I lack the focus and attention to detail. I think the same goes when I write essays.  Another boring day of work today, but afterwards I watched some of Smackdown with Kaho and Derek. It seemed like old times. It was also cool to see John Cena wrestle again. It's weird to think that I talked to the guy outside of the Galaxy before he made it to the WWE.   Work tomorrow and BBQ on Saturday...   ***

      Man... just working is such a drag. It feels like that's the only thing in my life. It's so... pathetic feeling. At least it's money. Life is boring though.  I'm looking forward to the BBQ this weekend. Food and friends and booze. Good stuff! That will be the highlight of the week.  In other news...  Weezer  put some new stuff up on their website. Sounds good, more stuff like  Maladroit . Real fun.  ***

      Some good planning today for my little bbq this weekend. I ordered another keg and I think this time we'll finish. Well... maybe... this time we are eating in addition to drinking... but then again we have Derek with us this time! Should be a fun get together of some of my really good friends.  ****

      A long day so far... I had work at 9 AM... came home and slept for a couple hours before playing some games on Yahoo with Flo. Some of the posse is going to be coming over later for RAW. That should be fun. It's hard to believe that our lives are starting to diverge with us begining careers. Well not me though... I've still got 5 years of school to go.  ***

      Man... I really need to finish the scripting for band of the month. Seeing it unfinished is annoying.  Not a particularly eventful day. The family went out for lunch and Claim Jumper since my aunt was in town. Good stuff. It's rare that I can get my parents to try eating different food.  I also watched Shallow Hal today. It was pretty good, but not hilarious. I guess it's meant to be more sweet than funny. Oh well, I was entertained.  Man... I just haven't been in the mood to write a lot lately.  **

      I just got home from work... a pretty long day filled with stuff prior to going to work and then work. Did that makes sense?  Anyway... I have more work tomorrow as well. I guess the money is needed.  Something else I want to comment on before I go. Aren't fish in aquariums supposed to be soothing or relaxing? Well... I was in the doctor's office today waiting and there was an aquarium. As I stared at the fish, I found myself getting pissed off rather than feeling relaxed. I guess I was feeling empathy for the fish... I felt frustrated and confined to a pathetic existance. It was a pretty bad feeling. I'm so glad I'm not a goldfish. I don't even like the crackers.  **

It used to be Arnold saying, "Good Morning. How are you? First I would just like to get to know you.... Who is your daddy and what does he do?" Now it's Mr. T saying, "Whatcha talkin about foo, quit your jibba jabba... you talk or you hurt!"

      I saw Ataris last night. A pretty good show, despite being a bit disorganized; however, I don't blame them. They played a show earlier in the day at the same venue. They probably didn't want to be redundant. They debuted some new stuff, which sounds really good. It's got a harder sound than their more recent stuff. I like that because it's less emo or pop punk. Not that, that stuff is horrible, but it's just my musical tastes. They kept repeating that they've been around for 5 years. It's hard to belive that.... I remember hearing about them 4 years ago as a freshman in college... the set was good and the crowd was full of energy despite the hot venue. I just think that they could have been a bit more organized, but I guess they just didn't want a complete repeat of the earlier show.  ***

      Not a very eventful day today... I slept most of the day... but then again I suppose it was recovering from yesterday. Yesterday I had work from 9 AM to 3 PM. An actually busy day. I worked with Samantha, whom I've never worked a Saturday with. She's pretty fun to work with, but... she's... kind of slow on working on work orders and stuff. After that I went to San Diego with the girls from Cambridge to go to the SD Fair and visited Julia. It was pretty fun. The fair was cool... although expensive. Heh at least I managed to rip off the evil Pizza Hut there. Because they were taking forever on my personal pan pizza ( which would have been totally tiny ), I had them give me 2 massive slices of pizza instead. After the fair, we hung out and Julia's where we spent the night. We watched some of Janet's videos... some of which I star in. That was pretty cool. We drove back around 8:30 AM and got back to Irvine around 9:30. I drove pretty fast. Pretty much after that... I slept. It was a good weekend overall.  Let's see my plans for the week... work tomorrow... go to the doctor and work on Tuesday... Wednesday I have a phone appt and work. Thursday is the 4th of July... not sure what I'm gonna do. Work on Friday night and Saturday morning. Kind of a busy week.   ***

      Hmm... the past 2 days... Yesterday I went to a reception at professor's house and then I went to a bar with a bunch of fellow grad students. Lots of drinking for about 12 hrs. I like to drink and all, but man... that was a lot of drinking. I didn't get home until like 5 AM. I woke up today relatively early, made some phone calls and then went to Walmart. I've been doing a lot of shopping for necessities. I got some stuff at Ames and Walmart... and I need even more stuff. I need more tupperware or bowls or something like that. I'm already using the 2, I have to store stuff. I'm annoyed because I lost my sunglasses at Walmart. They were a good nice pair too. Quite annoyed by that.   In other good news... I finally got to talk to Laine again. It's cool to catch with with a friend.  ***

      Here I am in Binghamton! In my own place!  This is quite cool. I had a long day though. I left the house last night around 7:10 PM for my 10:15 PM flight... which would last a little over 5 hrs. I didn't get much sleep on the plane, and got to Philadelphia around 6:20 AM EST. Luckily Julia is always up late so I managed to kill time by talking with her until my flight to Binghamton took off at 8 AM. I got to Binghamton around 9:20 AM and from the airport I got to my apartment and checked in and all that. After some fiddling with my laptop and unpacking, I went to campus. I didn't get back from campus until around 5 PM. I haven't had much sleep in the past... many hours. I'm exhausted!  It's been cool here so far though.  ***

Then we all went to BJ's with Naomi and Heather. Brandon also met up with us there. It was really cool. Food and beer with good friends. Can't beat a combo like that. I'll be meeting up with the girls minus Flo for lunch later. It should be a good final good bye before I leave tomorrow.  ****

Naomi said she's going to take me out for a drink tonight and Flo said we'll try to meet up for dinner tonight. Lots of goodbyes coming up.  Things I still need to do clean my room, pack and maybe go to the beach.  In rotation right now  Propagandhi 's "Anchorless."  ***

      Ok... I fixed the problem with the reboot. Turned out to be a driver problem thanks to my mouse. All is good except for the idling thing. Oh well.  Today Brandon and I went to visit Andy in his new place down in SD. It's a cool place. We hung out and drank... went down to downtown and drank more at Rock Bottom. Good stuff. Good times hanging with the posse. Didn't get a chance to meet up with Flo and Julia though.... seems we're always in the same vicinity, but don't get a chance to meet up. Oh well... hopefully I'll see all of the girls tomorrow.  In rotation now...  Bad Religion 's  All Ages .  ***

I'm not sure what I want to do the next couple days. I kind of want to hit the beach before.. well... I have no opportunity to hit any beaches. I'll try to do that on Monday.  ***

      Yep... so yesterday was my last day at Nielsen. It's all over. It's nice knowing that I don't have to work at least until I find a new job in NY.  I was supposed to go clubbing last night, but I decided that I didn't want to waste the money on a cover... heh so Brandon and I went to Pasadena anyway, but not to Q's. We went to a bar got buzzed... walked around and the had a few more beers at Hooters. Man... now my wallet is empty. But I guess it's worth it. It's cool to hang out with the friends before I leave. That's especially since I won't see them for many months.   Actually I'm a bit concerned about money right now. I screwed up on my financial aid... I allocated the extra money I had needed to buy a laptop to the spring semester and not the fall. I had planned to get laptop today, but now I'm all like worried if I should still get it. Then again... no tv or computer in an apartment by myself would suck ass.   I guess I'm off to Fry's anyway.  **

      I just saw a bit of that O'Reilly guy from Fox News... that guy was being a total dick to the German ambassador because the Chancellor of Germany refuses to back a US invasion of Iraq. Everytime I see that guy, I get irritated because the guy is sometimes so arrogant and brash about issues. He argues that Germany owes the US for all that has happened since WWII; therefore, Germany owes the US military support in case of an invasion. I swear that's fucked up. Here's the truth. Military action... especially the invasion of a country like Iraq, who's people have been starving thanks to UN sanctions is not going to simple. People will die. Billions of dollars will be spent on weapons. Thus having social and economic implications. Then once you oust Hussein, what do you do? What about the social and economic situation of Iraq after such an invasion. There are so many issues at hand. I'm no military or political politician, but any student of history knows that it's not that simple to invade Iraq, oust Saddam Hussein, and then have peace. O'Reilly over simplifies the issue and knowing how dumb many people in the public are, it creates a jingoistic / militant atmosphere that simply isn't cool.  *

      Oh... the rest of my day... I check out laptop prices at CompUSA and Best Buy. I found a couple that looked reasonable and good enough for me. I'll check out Frys tomorrow after work.  I'll be honest with myself. Everytime I go to that shopping center in Mission Viejo / Laguna Hills with Best Buy and CompUSA, I'm reminded of the time I dated a certain someone. Driving up the 5 around the Broadway exit reminds me of another certain someone. Hell driving up the 605, or things around UCI, or whatever brings back some good and bad memories. Normally it wouldn't really bother me, but right around now it does. I want to tie up loose ends before I leave. Like I asked Julia today... ever wonder what if you and a certain someone just remained friends. What if emotions ever got out of control? For the most part all lose ends are tied, except for maybe with one person. She's the only person who's ever really offended and infuriated me. She's the only person who's really pushed me to the limits of who I think I am. Because the last words said were via email, I feel like I was a coward. I feel like I should have said what I said in person, so that I might have felt a shred of guilt, unlike I do now. I don't know... it's a complicated situation.  **

      Funny how you think you're productive at the time, but when you think about it more... you realize that you weren't.

I don't think I've gone to bed that early in years.  Things to do today... go to the bank, look for more Scott Hall figures, go to Frys to check out laptops.

      Man... this was a long ass weekend, but it was fun.  Yesterday, I worked from 9-12 and then went up to Naomi's to meet up with the girls for LACMA. From there, Steff and her sister, Naomi and I went down to the museum to meet up with Julia. The museum was fun. It was a fun outing with some good friends. I dug the work of William Kentridge. It was some awesome charcoal drawings and videos. Afterwards we all met up with Janet and Flo for dinner at  Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles . That was my first time there and it was damn good. After dinner, I took Steff's sister back to Irvine. It was a fun drive down. Steff's sister is cool. We had a lot to talk about. After picking up some of Steff's stuff, I went home and rested until I got a call from Janet to meet them at Flo's place. There we hung out all night. I didn't get home until 1 PM. After resting some more, I went to go hang out with Linda. We rented  Bubble Boy ,  How High , and a Jet Li movie. Now I'm home with work at 8 AM tomorrow.  Something that's been on my mind all day today is the balance between being yourself and being considerate of others. I'll be honest with myself. I'm an irreverent and oftentimes inconsiderate person. That combined with my demented view of the world can result with me saying stuff that is disturbing or offensive ot others. Many times I'm oblivious or just shrug it off... which adds to the inconsiderate nature of my personality. The problem at hand is the fact that someone told me that I offended a friend of mine with a sarcastic remark. Now, back to the balance between being yourself and being considerate of others, I wonder what's the best way to approach the situation. I would apologize, but that doesn't solve the larger problem of me realizing I probably have many more times in past said things that this friend didn't like and that I'll continue to say things my friend would prefer not to hear. Should I censor myself? I think that's my big question. It's something for me to think more about.  **

      Today was George and Samantha's last day at work and we had a little party/meeting to say goodbye. It was really weird to know that it's going to be a long time if ever I see them again. After the meeting, I really didn't want to work anymore. I doubt my motivation will go up at all for the rest of the time I'm there. Knowing that the people I love work with are gone, make it less of a motivation to keeping going.  After work Jon, Derek and I had some of  Stone 's Arrogant Bastard Ale. A nice 7.2% beer in a 1 pt. 6 oz bottle. I was feeling good after a bottle and we all chatted and watched TV.  I feeling more and more the sense of the end being right around the corner in this chapter of my life. It's... not sense of excitement or sadness... it's just a weird feeling.   Well... work in 7 hours. Time to get some sleep.  **

I mentioned that I went to Scotland last summer and that it's my favorite place in the world. He went off and rambled about where he lived outside of Glasgow. That was so cool. Hopefully the pictures come out alright.  ****

Last night after work George and I went to  Fuddruckers . Man, that place makes awesome burgers. Sure it's $10 for a meal, but everything is simply delicious. 2/3 lb. hamburger, potato wedge fries and a drink. Afterwards we had some beer at my place while watching some TV.  Today, Derek and I plan on going to see some UPW featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper.  **

      Something that I was just thinking about is something that my buddy Steff brought up about unrequited love the other night and I think listening to oldies made me think about it more. I honestly think that society puts so many  ideal  images in our minds that oftentimes we get caught up in our desire for the ideal that we lose touch with reality. That is especially the case in romance. A little disclaimer before I begin, this is most certainly not critique of my friend's love life, but rather a commentary on society. So if she or any of our friends are reading this, that's what it is.  I think that from the time we are born we are socialized to have the nearly universal  ideal  of the soulmate. The perfect person that will make your life complete. That's an image that companies such as Disney has made millions off of in movies and television shows. It's a fantasy image that is programmed into us; therefore, throughout our lives we yearn to fulfill that fantasy. I admit the image is important to help create social order, which is a good thing. However, I think it also does something really bad. It makes us feel incomplete without a girl or guy in our lives. We're unhappy unless we're living the fantasy that Disney wants us to live. That makes us search and many times latch ourselves onto people who aren't always the best for us in order to try to feel complete. That's a unhealthy situation to be in, because you're living in fantasy not reality. You think the person is the greatest, even though they're not. I'm sure most of us have been in such a situation. It isn't pleasant is it? I myself have tried to avoid being in that situation again by realizing that my life isn't incomplete without a significant other. I recently refused to be brainwashed by Fascist Walt and I think I'm the most content I've been in a while as a result.  Songs that are applicable to the topic at hand are the Buzzcocks' "Ever Fallen in Love?" Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive," and the Chiffons "One Fine Day."  **

Saturday work half day and then go to  LACMA  and dinner with the girls. Sunday, watch movies with Linda.   Here's something I put up on the AA Rockers message board in response to how Pink isn't punk.   RE: RE: RE: anyone can be punk rock...  I personally don't like how the popular media whores the notion "punk." I read an article on  XXX  in the LA Times and it talked about the punk rock image. That would make sense as the movie involves a lot of extreme sports and extreme sports and punk have long had a strong bond, if it wasn't for the fact that the only involvement of punk rock in the movie is Vin Diesel's reference to the  Vandals . The sound track is all nu-metal and rap-rock with no punk. The same could be said about how the media talks about Avril Lavigne.  I'll be the first to admit that the term punk is a broad term. If you look at music history... new wave, goth rock grew out of the punk scene in the late 70s and early 80s. Look at some of the big bands we have today...  Social D  is labeled punk, but they sound very country.  AFI  and TSOL have a goth tinge to them.  Bad Religion  has large collection of folk rock-ish songs. What I think ties them all together is the punk scene and inspiration. From the scenes of LA/ Orange County  suburbs, to NY's CBGBs, to Gilman Street and being inspired by bands like the  Clash , Sex Pistols, and X.   The lineage behind bands and artists on the XXX soundtrack such as Rammstein, Drowning Pool, Moby and Nelly are totally different. Therefore they aren't punk.   Pink defineately isn't punk   I'm hungry now... time for lunch.  ***

      I feel really tired today. I don't really know why. The whole day has been sort of... eh?  I finally finished removing the comment tags on all my mp3s and putting in tags that help me pull up covers and old school punk really easily in Winamp3. That's an awesome program.  In rotation right now is the Buzzcocks, Clash, the Archies, Chiffons, and Smokey Robinson.  **

      I had a normal day of work today. It was... business as usual. Afterwards, I shopped for groceries, and made dinner for the girls. It was cool and fun. I made chicken and pasta for them. We made it a somewhat formal dinner and Steff made dessert. Steff and Janet shared their stories of their trips to Europe and we all hung out. It was just a nice evening. I'm really going to miss the girls when I leave for Binghamton. The truth is that I know them, but I don't know them as well as I'd like. That's considering that I consider them the best friends I've made in my undergrad days. I would say them and PM are the friends I feel I know the most from my undergrad days. They're really people I'm going to miss. I'll also miss the beers with Alex and Makino. They were cool drinking buddies. It's going to be interesting leaving familiarity and starting a new life.  ***

      Today... I had a 1/2 day in the office and then went up to Temple City with my mom and my bro to pick out what pictures we want from last weeks photo shoot. That was pretty much it as I spent most of the day napping...   As sometimes happens when I can't get myself to bed... I do a lot of thinking. I was thinking a lot more about the notion of being a good person and I really think that many religious people who equate religiosity with goodness are quite nuts. I've been reading a lot lately about Shawn Michaels and his new religious life. In an interview on the Million Dollar Man's webpage, he talks about how he knows he's going to heaven and how some people are going to hell. I personally think that strain of thinking, which unfortunately many religious people have is messed up. For example, I'm not a "good" person because of fear. I don't believe in heaven or hell, and yet I don't commit crimes or anything like that. I have my flaws, but I think for the most part I'm a "good" upstanding citizen. I think that says a lot more about my character, than someone who lives his life fearing where he's going to go when he dies. That way of thinking is no different than the notion of a "good" citizen in Nazi Germany. You follow the rules out of fear of the Gestapo. We could even go further back into history... with "good" Christians slaughtering other Christians in the 30 Years' War or Christians killing Muslims during the Crusades. What about the current Middle East? "Good" Jews and Muslims wanting each other's blood to be spilled? So in my opinion using religion to measure the "goodness" of actions is not cool in my book. (I'm using parentheses around the word good, because that word is so relative to time and place.)  The whole Shawn Michaels showing off his born-again attitude in the WWE and preaching is also disturbing to me because of the proselytizing. I have a big problem with proselytizing... which is something that is pretty big with Christianity. I could go into the whole linkage between that, and the American notion of Manifest Destiny and imperialism, but I'm not. I'm going to write about a more personal experience: a so-called friend wanting to change me. Without going too much into detail, many months ago she admitted to wanting to convert me. I once asked her if I've been a good friend to her and she responded by saying I've been one of her best friends. I then asked if I've been such a good friend without religion, how would religion change me. Her response was that I'd just be "better." I asked what that meant and how I'd be better and all she said was that I'd just be "better." That was one of my final straws with this former friend. For her to want to change me, despite me being a great friend (according to her) was an insult. That was in addition to the fact that she was measuring my "goodness" with my religiosity, not my actions. That was another insult. This was all in the face of me never once wanting to change her, despite our conflicting points of views. I guess we'll find both find out who was the "better" person when our souls are weighed by a half man half animal deity, let into Heaven or sent to Hell, get reincarnated, or get eaten by worms and bacteria.  **

      Today was just another day as usual. I guess the only news is that it looks like next week will be both George and Samantha's last week. That means one week without them, before I get out of there. It's really crazy that the 3 of us are out of there at the same time. It's really sinking in that I only have 2 weeks left at a place where I honestly did enjoy working and had a lot of fun. I've had awesome co-workers... George, Samantha, Julia, Thelma, Amanda, and even Lisa (despite our falling out after she left the company). That in addition to the fact Derek and Kaho will be back in the Bay Area by next weeks end makes me realize how many people I'll miss when I leave for Binghamton. Man... I'm really going to start a new chapter in my life.  Tomorrow all I have planned is work in the morning and then I'm free after that. Sunday I'm going to the movies and Monday I have work and dinner with the girls.  I've been downloading all sorts of stuff lately... lots of old school punk... Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Adolescents... and a lot of oldies... from Chuck Berry to the Marcels. The count of tagged MP3s is up to 2711.  ***

      A pretty cool day today! HomeTown Buffet, ping-pong, pool, foosball, and Conan the Destroyer with the Posse.  Here's something I've been thinking a lot about lately. The notion of good will towards others is something I've been really thinking about. I was wondering if there is any way of acting without selfishness or self-interest. For example... good people... when they do good things, they always say that doing good things makes them feel good. There's defineately a reward system built in. So does the motivation involve self-interest? For religious people, they do things because of God. Well, isn't fear of going to hell or the desire to please a deity kind of motivated by self-interest? I remember having a discussion about this with Lisa eons ago about this. I won't go into the details on that discussion, but I really do believe that all human action revolves around the self. It just happens that some of those self motivated actions happens to help others in society. I think people just don't want to accept a value-less paradigm of looking at things, because it doesn't benefit them.  Oh yea.. I'm like so poor right now! Bleh!  **

      I'm digging the newest beta build of Winamp 3. I love the navigation of the music library and how it's a functional playlist. Now I don't ever have to touch RealOne's music library to pull up songs by genre or year released. Oh yea... I'm up to 2670 MP3s full tagged. I tagged a bunch of stuff I've had on my hard drive for a while in addition to downloading a bunch of stuff ranging from the Archies, Wham!, to the Buzzcocks and the Kinks.  ***

      A very boring day today... Samantha, Julia, and George all ditched work today, which left me with Amanda and the new guy Frank. I also mailed out my tuition today... I am now broke until my financial aid comes.  **

      God Damn KROQ taunting me with those 909 Invasion commercials!  It's been a good day despite it being a very regular day. I know I've been bitching about work, but today I realized that I'm really going to miss working at Nielsen. It's been a pretty good year and half. I can't say I've ever been completely miserable at work. In addition to that pretty much all my co-workers are really cool. George is leaving the week before I am for Berkeley and my last day is the 23rd. Samantha is already interviewing for new jobs too. The office is doing some major changes right now...  We also got some new computers at work. 1.8 ghz, DVD/CD-RW, Radeon video card, lots of RAM, etc. I totally need to load some games and shit on there. Samantha is requesting MP3s. We'll see what I can load up in the next few weeks.  In other news, I've got some good plans coming up. Thursday, it's HomeTown with the Posse. Sunday is a movie marathon at good old Spectrum, and Monday is a dinner party with the girls. I'll probably work some good stuff in between those days. It should be fun.  ***

      Grr... I hate work. What made my day worse in addition to working is that this year's KROQ 909 Invasion has the best lineup I've ever seen.  Sex Pistols , Blink-182,  Bad Religion ,  Pennywise ,  Vandals ,  Offspring ,  Social D , X, The Damned, TSOL, Adolecents, Circle Jerks, The Distillers, Unwritten Law, and GBH, A New Found Glory. They're basically all bands I would like to see. Old school to current punk bands for one show! Damn it! Damn it to hell! Take away all the enthusiasm I had for going to Binghamton. I almost want to come back just for the weekend to see that show!  I have a headache!  **

      Whoo! I just woke up. Yesterday was quite a long, but cool day. The family went out for family portraits yesterday in Temple City. So we all got dressed up and trekked up there for a photo shoot, then we trekked all the way back. Then I went all the way up LA with Naomi and her friends for Ethiopian food. Good stuff. Then I went to hang out with Flo and her friends until 4:45 AM. Fun stuff.   Plans for today? None. Probably do some reading and maybe some painting as well. I want to be productive.   ***

      Man... I'm out of shape. I totally don't have energy these days. Is it the capitalist system draining my spirit away? My eating habits? My lack of working out lately? My energy is just way down today.  Naomi should be over in about 45 minutes for some Ethiopian food soon. Depending on when I get back, I may or may not see if Flo is still at the BBQ.  **

      My day today was just like any other day. Wake up, eat, go to work, come back and sit in front of the computer, and squeeze in some reading. I really should try to be more active.  Work today went by relatively quick. I was somewhat productive today setting up appointments and doing some work on flags. I know I shouldn't have spent so much money on dinner, but I hadn't been to Casa Garcia in a while. I got myself a Texas burrito, which was damn good. Then again for approximately $7.50... it had to be good. The place unfortunately ripped Samantha off on her combo. They didn't give her a taco, when they should have. That's kind of a bummer.  In other news, I have quite a few money concerns right now. Tuition is due next week, my credit card and phone bills are coming in a few weeks, and when I get to Binghamton, I need to buy a bunch of supplies. That's quite a bit of concern for me. I'm sure things will work out, but still... I have worries.  Tomorrow it's a family portrait at 4 and Ethiopian food at 7. Should be a productive and fun day tomorrow.   Back to reading about World Historical Systems.  ***

      Ah... Derek, Kaho and I spent some time playing ping-pong today, and getting stuff at Bevmo. Good stuff. $1.23 for a 6 pack of Heineken is a damn good deal... thanks to a coupon I had. Derek and Kaho also had some chardonay thanks to another coupon. From there it was Del Taco and watching Smackdown. Good stuff. Kaho was a bit messed up from 2 Heinekens and 1/2 a bottle of wine.  Yay... work tomorrow. At least Tom, Pat, and Rudy won't be around. That means an easy day tomorrow. Heh... I might even get there a bit early to squeeze in some time.  In rotation today is  Anti-Flag 's  Mobilize . That's a damn good album. "9-11 for Peace" is such a bad ass song.  ***

      It's 2:30 and I already feel like I've done a lot today. I went UCI to show Minh-An and her boyfriend around UCI as well as get my transcripts sent to Binghamton. Woohoo... my degrees have been posted. That mean's I officially have my BAs now. Too bad I have to wait until October for the actual diplomas. I also bought some more wine. I had a nifty $6 off coupon for Bevmo, which was handy. I'll probably hang out with Derek and Kaho later today.  ***

      Alas... I'm all out of wine. That means I should go purchase some more tomorrow. Or should I? I should be saving money.   I picked up my Samsung R225 today. It's an awesome little phone. Really light, it's got AIM, a blue back light, a neat clock screen saver thing, and more. I think it gets better reception than my Nokia 3390 too. Let's just hope I get good reception in Binghamton.  Work was a slack off day. Lots of chit chat with George, Julia, and Samantha. I also taught Samantha how to play  Minesweeper  today. My goal is to beat the advanced level of Minesweeper before I leave Nielsen. Heh... I probabably play at least 30 minutes worth of that game while at work.   I'm quite happy I have a day off tomorrow. Hopefully I'll get a chance to hang out with the posse. I could really use some pool time as I haven't hit any body of water all summer... hence my Hank Hill tan right now.  ***

      The past few days have been a combination of lazy and busy. Lazy in the fact that I'm a bit behind on my readings and busy in the fact that I've been doing a lot of shopping. I bought some warmer clothes, beer, a coffee maker, a new knife, a cutting board, one of those trays/racks for drying dishes, a pillow, and lots of groceries.  It's been getting colder here, but it's not unbearable. I think I'm going to have to slowly build up my collection of warm clothes.  In rotation right the  Transplants  "Tall Cans In The Air." It makes me much more curious about their upcoming album and makes me wish I saw them play with the Distillers. Audioslave's "Cochise" is interesting too. I want to hear more of them too.  ***

      I just got an email from Esther saying that she's scared that she may live to see the end of the world. I think her fear is justified. Outside of relatively small intellectual and leftist circles, here in the United States, people are geared up for war. It's horrifying to me that so many people so readily want an invasion of Iraq. Blame the propaganda machine and rhetoric of George W. Bush, blame the fact that the United States is a superpower in search of a new enemy, blame arrogance, blame greed, and even blame human nature. It's a scary time indeed. While I don't think the literal end of the world will happen... perhaps change of civilization as we know it?   It's hard to say. We live in a time in which there is a growing global elite that is defined by both national and economic divisions. This elite at this global level, has less opposition than their national counterparts. There is no global "state" that regulates pure laissez-faire capitalism. Multi-national corporations take advantage of nations and people with almost no restriction in most parts of the world, despite the human rights movement. It's not like on the national level where there are laws to protect its citizens. Also there essentially there is no entity that can regulate the aggression of strong states against smaller ones. The United States' disregard for the sovereignty of nations in its way have been well documented and there is no global "police force" that can keep it from bullying other nations.  If World War 3 were to break out... is it possible that the notion of a global state will exist? Either from the United States exerting total dominance over the world or the nations of the world realizing that organizations like the U.N. have no real power and creating an organzation either that truly is a world government?  Who knows? That's just my rant for today.  ***

Honestly... if I wasn't saving $2000 per semester in tuition, I wouldn't have given up my California residency. Oh well...   I also managed get about 80 pages read today at the library. I did it in about 2:30 hrs... which is much more than what I got done last night at home. I think I should read at school more often. Tonight I plan on finishing the Marxism and Law book and getting to the Hunt book.  A grilled cheese sandwich awaits me...  ***

      Ok... well the past 2 days I've been busy with school stuff. I didn't get home from school until 10:45 PM on Tuesday and last night I was reading. I get to enjoy even more reading today. I really need to get into the groove of massive reading.  Well... let's see what's new with me. I got emails from Rafael, Esther, and Shanna recently which was cool. Those are all people I haven't talked to seen in ages. It was quite cool to hear from them. Heh... I also sent one of those screaming ghost things to Steff, and she responded that she opened it up and work. Hah... that must have been a funny sight! I feel bad... truly I do, but man... they made the entertainment factor go way up.  Today... I get to do more photocopying, buy some really expensive books, and read. Oh and I also need to go to the DMV to try to become a NY state resident.  In rotation lately has been  Millencolin .  ***

I got my notes on Chomsky done, and I just need to do a review on the customs and law reading and take a peak at the Collins book before I'm done for the night.   Oh... in other news... I emailed some people I haven't talked to in ages. I got one response for far, which was cool. Hopefully my mail box will be full tomorrow with lots of neat emails.

I hate baseball... I have no idea why I was playing it. I have 601 at 1:10 PM... so I have about an hour until I have to catch the bus.

      Ok... I was still hungry after having my left over veggies and chicken... so I made some spinach mac n cheese. I think they came out much better this time than last due to my inclusion of mushrooms and more margarine. There was just a stronger flavor of the veggies than last time as well as more richness in the sauce thanks to margarine. The mushrooms added more heartiness to it too.  ****

      Ok... I woke up massively early this morning. I then forced myself back to bed and that seriously messed with your head for the rest of the day. Makes you all groggy. Anyway I made myself a grilled cheese sandwich and then went to Ames. I seriously came really close to buying a DVD. They had a 2 DVD pack of the 3 Stooges and the Little Rascals for like $8. It was tempting... as was Osmosis Jones for $10. I decided to just wait for prices to drop more on stuff like Die Hard and Terminator 1. Those are some good movies but still cost like $17. Heh... I wonder if I should eventually get one of theose ChangChong TVs... man... that sounds so wrong.  ***

      The readings for Bix's class are pretty straight forward. They're basically critiques of democracy that most leftists (like myself) have about our form of democracy. So it was an easy read for me. Keyder's reading, while short is hard to understand. I think the gist of it is complex balance between convention or customs in society and law. I need to review all this stuff again before class on Tuesday just to be sure.  ***

      I had a pretty simple but good dinner. Sure produce here in upstate NY sucks ass, but just veggies and chicken can be a hearty and good meal.   Perhaps I should get offline and get some reading done.  ***

      Man... yesterday really was a lazy day. I need to get some shit done today. Two unproductive days in a row isn't a good thing.   I just want to comment on how it's really annoying how people tell me to wake up on what a great place the USA compared to other places... when I'm saying that as a superpower we should be working to create peace and prosperity not perpetuating the inequality and suffering in the world. Attitudes like that aren't going to make the world a better place. Sometimes ignorance is bliss I guess.  **

I guess this is what grad school is all about... drinking and reading.  I'm getting some laundry done right now. I also need to get my financial aid check too. That in addition to get some reading done and go photocopy some more reading. Fun stuff.  ***

      Today was a nice day weather wise... then again I was indoors on campus most of the day. I got my readings for Bix's class copied and met with Prof. Santiago about course work and all that. Then I went to Prof. Diaz's course and it didn't really interest me, so I'm dropping it. I want to check out Keyder's class to replace it.  All in all today was a good day. Tomorrow I have another meeting on campus, and then I need to go grocery shopping. I want to get some spinach and tomatoes to go with my macaroni.  ***

      My first graduate class today went really well. It doesn't see that hard. I think only obscenely hard one will be 601. I mean these classes are more or less like my history seminars which I took last year. The reading is comparable to that. I just have to write a bit more. I also have more time with this being a semester system and I'm not working right now.  Heat and humidty sucks ass. What the hell is this a freaking rain forest? Rain, trees, heat and humidity. Maybe I should have gone to South America for school?  **

      Wow... last night I was up until 3:30AM chatting with Laine... my good buddy in Edmonton. It's hard to believe we've been writing to one another for almost... like a 1.5 years? We haven't really chatted much in the past few months, with us being being busy and out and about during the summer.  Well today is the first day of class. I have a Comparative State Formations class at 7... so I have a lot of time to kill. I'll be going to the market again today. I need more juice and other beverages. I think I could also use some mouthwash, and paper towels too. After that, I'll probably come home, eat, and then go back to campus.  ***

      Ok... so Fallout 2 didn't work. That CD got tossed into the trash as a result. I knew I should have taken my bro on the offer of taking the original and not the copy. Bleh.  I just did some chatting and listened to NPR instead. Did some chatting with some internet folk that I haven't chatted with in a while. That was kind of cool. Man... I have 19 hrs until my first class. That's just lovely.  I've been listening to a lot of  Face to Face  lately. So that's what is rotation right now.  ***

      A pretty good day for the most part. My sink started working again, I went for a walk through a natural preserve area to get to campus, saw lots of squirrels and deer, and had a good dinner. The only bad part was my refrigerator froze my eggs. It wasn't just a loss of a dozen eggs, but it's kind of a pain getting eggs home via the bus.  I'm bored so I'm installing Fallout 2 on my comp. I hope this cheapo burned copy works alright. If not, I can always pay Target or Walmart a visit.  Class starts tomorrow... with a 7 - 10 PM class! Lovely huh? Well I guess it being so late in the day gives me a chance to do stuff like go get more juice and stuff at Walmart.  ***

      Ok... due to the eventual cancellation of Cox@home by my parents / brother... I moved my webpage over here to Fortunecity.com. I managed to get the changes I mentioned a few days ago up as well. Hope you all like it.  Not much since my last post. I talked to Steff a bit, which was nice. She was just checking up on me to make sure I got home alright the other night, via the whole text message thing I showed her. I've also been chatting with her sister lately too. Both young ladies are quite cool. Heh... I guess their parents did a good job. I'm still feeling kind of bored though. Perhaps I'll give someone else a call after this since it's still free weekends for me right now.  ***

      Damn that sink of mine. It's been f*ed up since last night. I'm most annoyed that I'll have to wait until Tuesday to get it fixed. Stupid cheap imitation draino. I'm not a happy camper on that issue. Well I realized if I use foil around my pasta and heat it in the oven, I won't have to use the bathroom sink to clean much more than my fork. That should hold me over until Tuesday, when I can bug the people in the apartment's office.  **

      Good grades and that workshop seem to have motivated me a bit. I wonder how long it will last.  I got some ideas written down for my paper for 620. Some of the stuff Dr. King talked about really made me think about my paper from a different perspective, but I think I may be drifting too far away from the legal aspects of globalization, which my topic is on. I need a way to explain the relationship between to "things" in the superstructure and how it's involved in globalization. The Marxist way of looking at things is relatively easy to think about, but I just need to figure out a way to verbalize it. I think a Weberian perspective might be interesting... culture and rationality...  I feel really tired, despite it being kind of early for me.  In rotation right now is some  Green Day .  ***

      Wow... snow and getting the highest grade in the class... can it get even better? I had a very tasty sandwich too! Rock on!  I don't know if anyone reading this is anyone from my grad school... but I'm sick of talking about factions, cliques, etc. I've never been one to fit into one and I don't plan on it. My fellow new students know it's bullshit too... but someone told me that some of them have hints of being associated with or drawn into them already. You know what? This stuff is retarded and as long as people are still cool to me, then I have nothing bad to say about them. If someone starts being an asshole or bitch to me then it's a different story.   As  Bad Religion  sings... fantastic images and hope are linked. This applies to a lot of things.  In rotation right now is some  Social Distortion .  ****

      I'm a lazy ass I know. When I got home... I ate, slept, and then sat in front of the computer. Well... I managed to talk to Stephanie (the one in California) for a bit. We talked about a variety of stuff... but the most interesting thing was that there's a swat priest in every Catholic diocese in case of the need for exorcism. That's pretty bad ass.  Imagine a priest calling for back up due to demonic possession and getting the baddest mofo of a priest bursting through the door.  "I'm here to chew bubble gum, and kick ass... and I'm all out of bubble gum."  **

      I get the feeling it will be a night of insomnia... coffee and 14-15 hrs of sleep don't mix. Then again maybe I should force myself to sleep. I did this last week and I was totally out of it in class.  I talked to Esther on the phone earlier tonight (yay for free long distance and unlimited weekends). It was cool talking to someone that I haven't talked to in a long time.   Oh... I just deleted a long ramble where I try to combine my world systems studies stuff with my personal life / way of thinking. It was lots of BS, that really didn't need to be seen by the world.  ***

      I went out last night to the TASC Nite Market there. It was alright. I ended up hanging out with professors rather than undergrads. It's hard for me to accept the whole undergrad life is gone. Especially when Arnold is speaking at UCI on Tuesday!  Esther and I were writing to one another talking about what brings excitement into our lives. I mentioned doing stupid Jackass like stuff as one of the things that do it for me. Something else that's fun is grocery showing with my disc man playing the  Ramones .   I'm feeling really lazy today. I kind of want to go back to bed.  Oh by the way... I'm very much against anyone calling me prior to noon. It better be something important or really good if it warrants waking me up.   **

      Wow it's been a crazy past couple of days. Thursday night was a party at Stephanie's place. It was a cool party and lots of fun. Following the party, we all went to the Belmar and drank some more. I ended up crashing at Zeynep and Gamze's place. Friday, I was only home for a short nap in the late afternoon, as I went directly to campus from their place. Later that night, Jeff, Gamze and I went to watch  Jackass: the Movie  and had some drinks at the Ale House. So it's been a really busy past few days.   ***

      Ok... I think I've put off buying the jacket for way too long... tomorrow I will buy a jacket along with groceries. I'm thinking of making enchiladas for Stephanie's potluck thing on Thursday night. So I'll have to pick stuff up to make them.  Man... I've been so tired the past few days... that one night that I went to sleep at 7 AM jacked me up big time. I went to sleep last night around 12:45 AM and I got out of bed around 2 PM today. Maybe I should really look into some gym time to boost my energy levels as well as add some regulation into my life?  Oh... I'm no impressed by  Weezer 's  The Lion and The Witch  EP. Maybe it's because they've put so much of their live stuff out on their webpage, that the novelty of having it just wasn't there?  One Man Army 's  Dead End Stories  (1998) isn't as good as their  Last Word Spoken  album. I'm really tempted to get their new album on BYO along with the  Anti-Flag /Bouncing Souls split. Then again that's money that I really shouldn't spend.  ***

      Damn it... stupid refrigerator! Even though I turned down the coldness level on that thing, it's still freezing stuff. Seriously! As if the produce here wasn't bad enough, it's making things even worse!  Kind of another lazy day. It's funny... I always follow up good active days with days of absolute nothing. Yesterday I went over to Chi-Wei's place for dinner... myself along with a bunch of other people. It was cool, because pretty much everything that his wife cooked was like total Taiwanese stuff... like my mom used to make. It was cool eating that stuff, because it's been almost 2 months since I've eaten food like that. I should really learn how to make that stuff like that. I mean... it's stuff I grew up on... it'd be a nice treat for myself every so often. Also lots of the snacks we had while chatting after dinner was stuff I haven't had since I was a kid.   Let's see things for me to do... I need to finish my readings for 601 and I really need to get going on my reading paper and research paper for 620. As for comparative state formations... man... I really don't care about that class anymore.  Also I've been trying to archive my mp3s on CD recently... it's really a bitch. I wish I had $200 handy so that I can get an external hard drive.  ***

      Ever been so tired that you can go to sleep? I tried... I seriously tried.   I would seriously say that insomnia is something that makes one of my flaws... the flaw of dwelling on the past... much worse. I guess it's because when you're up at 2:30 AM and you have nothing to do, your mind is left to wander. There are a lot of "what if" scenarios that come up, that I think tend to slow down the foreward momentum that life should be going at. Oh well... that's just me being me though.  I think I'm going to give sleep another shot. I need to go grocery shopping and get some other stuff done tomorrow.   **

      I've been really weak on the blog updates haven't I? Well I've been really busy with 2 papers, which I've thankfully turned in already. Nothing really exciting this weekend due to that.  Let's see... what is new? I got a new mirror today! Hayes decided to install new mirrors in their old buildings. Not that I'm vain or fashionable, but it's nice to make sure there's no lint to other crap on your body before you go out.  I've been playing Fallout 1 and 2 again. I swear Fallout 2 is perhaps one of the most brilliant RPGs of all time. Interplay should get their act together and start work on Fallout 3. Seriously! There are so many Easter eggs in Fallout 2 that everytime I play it, I discover something new. Most recently I discovered that if mention that you stained the Cat's Paw magazines that you're delivering to Miss Kitty, she notices that one of the magazines has an article on energy weapons.   Looks like I'll be doing my research paper for 620 on Canada's plight in globalization... Any advice from Canadian readers?  Finally... it's really cool that Julia's been sending me pictures of all the stuff that the girls have been doing. It's nice seeing pictures of people you care about having fun and living life. Hah... if I had a digital camera, I'd be sending them all pictures of lots of drunk grad students.  In rotation recently has been Millencolin.  ***

      Kind of an interesting day yesterday. I went to help SeoKyung with her paper for 690T and then went to Zeynep and Gamze's place for coffee and dinner. It was cool... I finally had Turkish coffee. It was fun hanging out.   Having the coffee made me realize that probably one of the most useful classes I've ever had as an undergrad is Topik's history of coffee course. There's the whole knowledge / academic part where you learn about the world via one commodity; however, perhaps the best part is that the history of coffee is just interesting especially since you drink the stuff. I liked the Turkish coffee. It seemed a bit gritty, but it was good coffee.  I've got to go grocery shopping today... here comes the crappy produce.  ***

      Ok... so I figured out what was causing my computer to freeze. It turns down it was an update from the Windows update webpage. The question is which one? I did a system restore to approximately 2:13 PM today removing a set up of updates and driver updates. I debating whether or not to try to narrow down the specific update.  I have about 110 pages left of the Kriedte book left. I probably should get cracking on it rather than playing around online... oh well... 19 hrs is plenty of time to finish it. Right?  I really need to get to work on my paper on constitutionalism... You know what? I should really stick to the targets I set for myself. Stuff like waking up early, getting stuff done, etc. Especially stuff I don't necessarily want to do, but have to do. I manage to get stuff of little or no importance done (like the remodelling of this page)... and it's not so much eating away at productivity time, but rather should set an example for what I can get done if I really set my mind to it.  I'm debating whether or not I should purchase some  One Man Army  stuff from the Adeline Records webpage. They're an awesome opening band... I've seen them twice opening for NUFAN and TSOL. They've got a new album coming out on BYO, which has the Anti-Flag / Bouncing souls split album, which I really want! I don't know if I can justify the costs, when I should be spending money on necessities (I don't have any snow clothes yet).  Oh well...  ***

      It was quite an adventurous weekend! It took me 6 hrs to get to NJ due to being lost in PA on Friday. I saw forest, streams, rivers and rednecks before making it to New Brunswick, NJ to meet up with John near Rutgers... very nice place. Then it was an awesome show in South Amboy.  The Bouncing Souls  and  One Man Army  really put on a good show. Then after the show... I briefly talked to One Man Army and then went to a bar back by Rutgers to rest up before my trip back. Caught a satanic metal band at the bar though, the singer broke a bottle and cut himself open with it, punched a hole in the ceiling and burned a bible. Then it was a 4 hr drive home through snow. I got home at 5 AM.  Saturday night I met up with friends at a bar and ended up talking to a crazy chick. That confirmed I'm a magnet for crazy girls. She was telling me about her psychiatrist. Nice huh?  Well a short week starts today... going to NYC Wednesday for Thanksgiving with relatives.   ****

      I think I'll just go ahead and admit it. I'm homesick.  It's not so much that I'm not having a good time here, but I'm just not doing anything particularly fulfilling in my life right now. That's one big reason why.   **

      Well... not much really new recently. Been "trying" to work on my papers... been "trying" to get some sleep...   I rented  The Count of Monte Cristo  tonight... it's alright. I felt that the characters weren't very interesting. They were bland... but if it wasn't the intriguing story that Dumas wrote... it would have been less than alright. I wouldn't say crappy, because, for whatever reason, I can't hate historical fiction / period movies. Something that crossed my mind was how someone that I was telling Laine about last night really wanted to see that movie... it's funny how music and movies can really place your memories on the timeline of your life.   Man... I helped someone with their article and I didn't even work on my paper today... well technically I did if you count the early morning...  I think I'm gonna get cleaned up, get another beer and get to work on my paper.  ***

      I was talking to Naomi N. earlier tonight and she mentioned to me a girl that we knew back in high school is back in town and doesn't know anyone anymore. I think that topic ressonates with me because I sarcastically said in class on Monday that I grew up in a farming community. It makes me think about how home, while a static concept in the heart, is a constantly changing place in the real world. The Irvine of my childhood, of orange groves and fields of peppers and strawberries, has been replaced by homes, and shopping centers. New developments are still constantly popping up... I remember even just before I left Irvine, that at the intersection of Jamboree and Bryan... I still wasn't used to the Market Place surrounding me at all sides. I still remember riding my bike with Brandon past fields of peppers to get to what was at the time the Tustin Market Place. The example of this girl makes wonder what would it have been like to be like so many others and had left Irvine for my undergrad and now find myself permanently back in a very different Irvine. Not only is the place physically different, but so many of the people I knew are gone. It's something that I could perhaps face when I finish my phd. Or maybe I'll never return to Irvine physically like so many others... like Jon, like Evan. When you return, how does it change how you feel about home? I think that right now... I understand Stephanie's fear of leaving Irvine. Clinging on to home physically, because you don't want to lose touch with your perception of home. I'm suddenly deeply afraid of what it will be like if I return to Irvine after 5-6 years in Binghamton.   This also makes me realize that this is the longest I've ever been away from Irvine.   ***

      It's kind of early and I'm already tired... now... if I were to go to bed now... would I be able to do reading tomorrow morning? A good question indeed. I should have rented a movie today. I think I rent one tomorrow night... or should I buy Ghostbusters? Decisions...  At least I got about 2 pages of my state formations paper written... that means I'm 1/4 done with it.  **

      There's something about how music can take you back in time...  I haven't listen to Bracket in ages. Reminds me of sophmore year of my undergrad days. Also haven't heard some of  Weezer 's  Green Album  in a while. That totally reminds of me of England. Oh and some old  Bad Religion ... nostalgia instead of school work... bleh.  ***

      Man... my mind's been a bit out of it lately. In a good way though. For whatever reason.... I've finding pleasure and meaning in all sorts of things... contemplating the meaning of life in terms of  Conan the Barbarian , community service via food, colors, the sensation of cold, etc. Yea my brain is whacked... it's like every thought spawns countless other ones.   Anyway... the party last night was quite cool. I, of course, was pushing the limits of my physicality. I was doing rolls over Jeff's back and landing hard on the floor... he's a pretty tall guy making the fall a longer fall. A mosh pit on the dance floor, and I have cuts on my knuckles. I feel like I'm a kid again in so many ways.  Shit.. I've got a lot of work... but I'm a lazy ass.  Mmmm beef noodle.  ***

      I expected it to happen this way... I got to know her too well.   How do I feel? I don't know... I feel not pain nor grief... no elation. I just feel... that I did all I could and perhaps maybe more happened than I expected. It's a matter of time.

      Further laziness the past few days... I can't wait to be back in California this weekend.  I still have about 14 pages left to get done for my research paper by the end of the week. It's really doable.  Then it's home relaxing on Saturday... hanging / dinner out with the girls on Sunday, and work and going out with Esther on Monday.  In rotation right now is  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes .  ***

      Was it a lazy day? Kinda sorta... I did get stuff done and do some socializing... which is nice.  I woke up this morning around 9 AM, checked my email and then went back to bed. Woke up around 12:30 PM and did some chit chat with my buddy Laine and absolutely killed her in Reversi. I've been teasing that girl a lot lately. Maybe I should ease up on her?  I went to campus to print out 'drafts' of my 601 and I marked them up nicely... I will get those revisions done probably Sunday. I'm not really in the mood to work on those right now. I feel more in the mood to get more writing of my 620 research paper done... which I did a little of earlier.  Wataru came by with his microwave in the evening and I bought it off him for $15. Now I don't have to worry about buying real groceries for next week... and can get some junk food.  I also did some chatting with Esther. It's a bummer that she won't be coming to Vegas with us. It's funny how things turn out. It's been like a year and a half since Cambridge... and I didn't really get a chance to talk to her back then, but now we communicate all the time. I always did think she was pretty cool back then, and getting to know her more now isn't a let down.   I'm enjoying my apple cinnamon tea right now, but I'm feeling kind of hungry... I should make something for myself.  In rotation right now  Face to Face ... who I might see in Jan?  ***

      Sociology 690T is over! Everything was handed in around 10:45 AM today. Kick ass!  I think I get my World Systems Paper and Reading Paper done tonight. I started my day hella early today. I was up at 9 AM.  After I went dropped off my papers at school, I went to Walmart and managed to get some food and stuff. I also got another pair of pants of pants.  In rotation right now is  Division of Laura Lee . I downloaded their  Black City  album (2002) 2 nights ago. It's pretty good.   Now for some laundry, lunch, and a nap...  ****

I wrote about 8 pages. That's 2 pages a day. I have 9 days to write 22 pages... hmm that means I've got to increase my pace of writing.

Talk about a lazy ass huh? Anyway I woke up around 12 PM, sat around on the internet, made myself French toast, and did some cleaning. So it wasn't a total lack of productivity.  My plan is to get 2 papers done this weekend - the reading paper and the constitution paper. 6 pages shouldn't be that hard to get done in 2 days right? That leaves me next week to get my world systems paper and a good chunk of my research paper done next week. Then the following week, I should be able to get my research paper done. That's my plan.  In rotation right now is  Skid Row  and the  Strokes .   ***

      My Thanksgiving Holiday... quite an adventure.  It started Wednesday with my Greyhound bus breaking down on the side of the highway for 5 hrs in the mountains with no heat. Thus resulting in me being in a bus for 9 hrs. Needless to say it was not fun. I finally made it to NYC at around and met up with my cousin and her boyfriend and we walked around a bit (she lives really close to Times Square)... we did that Thursday morning too, before going to NJ for Thanksgiving. This city is like the epitome of capitalism. Corporations everywhere, stores! everywhere, adverstisements, etc.   NJ it was interesting, because it was my first time in 18 years back to the town I was born in. Kind of surreal. Made me think "What if I didn't move to CA?" We spent the night at my aunt and uncles and went back to NY in the afternoon. We hung around before going to my cousin's boyfriend's place... who was doing a film shoot for a class.  Saturday, we met up with one of my cousin's friends and we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a vegetarian place for dinner, before I was on my way back.   It was a smooth trip... except for the drunken Irishman who they wouldn't let on the bus...  I've slacked off all day... I've basically slept and been on the internet all day. I have a lot of shit to get done too.  Good weekend though...  ***

      So I just saw  Charlie's Angels  and  Fight Club  thanks to Netflix.  Charlie's Angels... cause I'm a big Bill Murrary fan... and he rocks in it... and Fight Club because everyone says it's great.  Fight Club lived up to its hype in my opinion. Tyler's social commentary was amazing. There was lots of deep and dark philosophy tossed in there. Issues that were brought up (but not limited to): changing family structure, social construction of religion, existentialism, consumerism, modernism, etc.  I still have memento to watch... I'll watch that tomorrow night.  For now... I'm gonna go shower and finally do some reading!  ***

      I can't believe I'm already unmotivated...  I need to get my ass in gear... this slacker stuff won't do.  Lately I've been having weird dreams... last night I dreamed that I kept trying to get to a bunker type place to hide out for the winter. The problem it was snowing and this tiny mountain path / cliff... was blocked with heavy snow... so Wataru and I couldn't get past it in his car. So I got out and walked... somehow I ended up in California and Nai picked me up in a classic Mustang... she would eventually drop me off at the bunker. It was guarded by people in Fallout combat armor, but they just trained me to use large and small guns and let me in. Then I was in and Cissa was watching TV in there. However, part of the bunker was the Heritage Park Library? So when I was there... a big black dude gave me a note that Prof. Topik wanted to talk to me. I would eventually talk to him about coffee and then I woke up.  Now playing...  Pulley 's "Gone"  **

      6 shots of tequila in under an hour last night... Sitting in a cloud of nicotine and other carcinogens...  Purging...  Now really hungry... despite just eating.  The start of this semester has been alright... but I lack something that made last semester exciting... it was something / someone that made coming home from class exciting. Someone with whom you share the details of your day... I realize that it probably won't be like that again with her. It's a bit dissappointing, but I guess life goes on.  ***

      As with many operas, there was a free public lecture prior to it starting... I have to say that the lady did just an alright job of talking about Verdi's life and the opera. I personally think that the guy that talked when I saw La Traviata... another Verdi opera... did a better job. It was funny cause because this lady was making a big deal about how Il Trovatore might not be the best Verdi opera, but it is her favorite at the begining of the talk. Then at the end she said it was the best opera. Hah, what a hypocrite.   I can't say I liked this opera a lot. The development of the story... despite what the lecturer said... is completely unbelievable. I mean... how do you toss the wrong kid into the fire? I was pondering that for most of the opera. I repeat she tossed the wrong kid into a fire! Also I felt the characters are far less appealing compared to other operas I've seen such as La Traviata, Don Giovanni, Carmen and Madama Butterfly. Well actually all the characters in opera generally suck ass... since they're mostly tragedies, but nothing really makes me feel for the ones in this one. For example the men in La Traviata and Madama Butterfly... you're totally all like... that guy's a dick! In Il Trovatore... you don't have a real asshole (in my opinion anyway).    That's not to say I didn't enjoy myself. Of all the opera's I've seen the scenary was the best... the backdrops were beautifully painted. From what I understand... the real scenary got stuck on a boat in Russia since the ocean froze. So local people made it. The opera group is the Russian State Opera... they're from Siberia (which means Binghamton must seem tropical to them).... and this is supposed to be the first time they've ever performed Il Trovatore in the US. Anyway... the scenary was just so damn good... that I was staring at it in some scenes more than the action itself. Of course the highlight for me was the Anvil Chorus... the aria that starts off Act II. It's been featured in so many cartoons! That was great!   Other things that I noted... I understand why one wants to sit up high in opera. The Andersen Center here is only one level.... despite from what I gather... double the capacity of Irvine's Barclay. No Dorothy Chandler or OC Performing Arts though. Anyway... reading supertitles looking up and following the stuff on stage is hard. Also... I've noticed at these artsy classy things in Binghamton... the elderly take over. I think I was one of the few young males in the building.... just like when I go to arts and crafts stores.  Didn't get to go to Cornell and see my cousin Kathy... SeoKyung is just... a very interesting person when it comes to planning things.  Party at Stephanie's tonight!  ***

However, we got there kind of late... so it didn't happen, but we met up with Naomi, Mike (Stephanie's sister's boyfriend) and his friends... so we ended up bouncing around all over LA checking stuff out. It was fun. I had actually, kind of talked to Mike before on the Weezer message boards before so it was cool to meet him. His friends from USC were pretty cool. I found the Turkish guy pretty funny... cause he was so much like the other Turks back in Binghamton... just slightly less cool.  Gonna have dinner with my girls from Cambridge later tonight, but before that... I'm gonna watch some T2 and Undercover Brother.  Listening to the  Ramones  today.  ****

      So I found out that Rose is engaged. It's really weird to think that someone you dated is going to be getting married, but I do wish her the best of luck. While we didn't see eye to eye on some stuff, things ended relatively amicably after a few months. I also do feel like I owe her alot in terms of introducing me to my culture. So I wish her the best of luck with everything.  While it's weird... it's a really heart warming to see good things happen to people. I also heard my next door neighbor from my dorm freshman year is engaged now too.   Well... I guess I'll always have my nude paintings to keep me occupied until a real girl who likes me back or doesn't have lesbian tendencies comes around. Yea... I was painting today. It's nice to hold a brush again.  ***

      Yesterday was a fun a day... lunch with dorm folk, dinner with the Cambridge girls, and Face to Face with George and Derek... I'll put up the review of Face to Face in the concert section sometime soon. I think I should move everything over to my  bingweb  account.  It was at the  Face to Face  show that that I realized that this situation with (you-know-who) needs to be resolved. I found myself thinking about her, when I shouldn't have been... the concert was my time... my time for my own fun... to escape into liminality as Turner says about rituals. Instead it was time not well spent. I zoned out for a few songs. So I was weak this morning and gave in to my emotions and wrote to her, but I need to make a stand and really back off now. I realized I need to back off or else I'm going to end up hurting myself.   **

      It's been an interesting week and a half I've been back.  I'm proud at how well I'm dealing with the... (you-know-who) situation... cause I know deep down inside I do like her a lot or at least want to like her a lot. I know I acted and said somethings that are rather unbecoming of me... due to my confusion, but nothing really bad. I think she understands my position, just as I understand hers.  I'm feeling pretty confident and good right now... despite still have lingering thoughts of her. It helped a lot going out with Stephanie and her friends. Not really my types... but still spending New Years with 4 extremely beautiful girls and getting props from strangers is great. Another thing that makes me feel good is... well (you-know-who) was / is cool enough that I didn't keep it secret... and well it was pretty obvious some people were jealous after hearing the story. It's nice to know that people want me... after not getting the object of your desire.  In rotation today is  Pulley  and  Alkaline Trio   ****

      I just watched  Pleasantville  and it reminded me of  Chocolat .  How is  Pleasantville  and  Chocolat  alike you might ask? There's a battle between the repression of traditional life and the modern sensibility of freedom. While Vianne and Anouk cause a little French town to open up, David and Jennifer cause the town of Pleasantville to open up. The people don't just open up themselves from the self repression that they previously suffered from (like the French townspeople during Lent), but they open themselves up to the possibility of social change in the face of not knowing what is to come. The possibilites of change and progress are, of course, modern ideas.   I have Pi and the Maltese Falcon sitting around to be watched. I'll save those for the weekend. Along with baking cookies!  ***

      I went to sleep at 1 AM last night and woke up around 9 AM... which meant that I almost missed the bus this morning...  Class so far has been alright... I get to go to another class in a few minutes... oh joy! I don't think my body likes being awake... it's used to be idle...  Anyway I realized why I didn't  Monster's Ball  was that great. Leticia was too weak of a character... needing Hank to make her feel good and take care of her. Now I realize that her situation was absolutely horrible and weakness is understandable; however, I think that her lack of strength and dependence on Hank made her less interesting of a character. Hank was certainly much of interesting of a character and all through the movie... I was questioning if he was necessarily in love with Leticia or was simply caught up in his own emotions... or even sense of connectedness to Leticia. That's just a thought.  I wonder if I should buy myself a coffee for class... I feel like I could use it / one.  **

I watched  Monster's Ball , which is a good movie. Was it brilliant? I dunno if I'd call it that... but it's one of those movies where lives intersect and people live "real" lives... so I liked it.

      Last night was full of booze, bagpipes, and big busted women... It was fun at Hooters 'cause a bunch of Irish bagpipers marched through to advertise a big Guinness toast later that evening. We didn't stick around for the toast, because we had already been there a while... but it was fun nonetheless.  Laziness ensues, despite going to bed earlier! I've installed Gabriel Knight 3... so far it doesn't have the same flair GK1 had. We'll see how it goes.  ***

This weekend I need to get through the  Capitalism and Slavery  book, Nick's book so I can return it, the readings for 602... and perhaps start working on some papers.

      Hmm... Wednesday night... I went to Keyder's talk... then went to the Ale House with Jeff... met up with Prof. Murray, Jenae, Sally, and Rob. That was cool.  Everyone seems to like the question I asked at the talk... which is good. I need to show I'm not all about moshing, staples in my arm, and other crazy shit. I can be academic when I want to be!  Last night... my comp crashed in a bad way and I had to reinstall Windows... that was quite a bitch. So I didn't go to the Belmar as planned. I managed to save my emails, documents, and other important stuff. That's what counts... programs... eh? I don't really use that many programs to begin with.  Today... I plan on going to campus and downloading shit... and then burning back ups. Eventually... I plan on getting an external HD, backing up all that's important, and then formating my old HD.  Oh yea... I finished my Folgers... which means I have some nice Starbucks coffee in my cup right now... that's some tasty shit.  I have  Monster's Ball  to watch tonight if I'm not too drunk after going to Hooters... I think that's still on....  ***

I need milk, juice, soda, coffee, etc.  Oh I finished  Brotherhood of the Wold ... the end was a bit more exciting.

      I finally did it! I finally initiated my  nothing  installation art project!  Man... so it's the worst snow storm to have hit the east in 7 years... I was on campus at 9:20 AM... until 5:30 PM... Prof. West no-showed due to the weather... of course Keyder had to be around so I couldn't just go home.  I talked to Richard and he gave me some ideas about how to fit historical materialism into my  Blockade  paper. He's a smart guy and was really helpful. I find that I'm doing lots of reading that isn't for my classes...  Last night I also managed to get some more painting done...  That's pretty much it... I don't know what to do about tomorrow. If it's snowing, I doubt Prof. Elbert will be treking down from Ithaca for class... then again if I need to pick something up from the library tomorrow. We'll see how the weather is.

      I've noticed a few people in various places claim that there is such a thing as meritocracy, that is people on top are there from working hard... especially in regards millionaires and elected officials.  I'm willing to admit that most of the old corporations of the United States that started in the 19th and early 20th centuries were a realization of the "American Dream." Poor immigrants who came to this country to find success and all that good stuff. However, how many poor immigrants ended up in slums and were forced to deal with anti-Semitism and racism? For ever success, there were thousands of failures. It should be noted that no minority ever gained the wealth comparable to the Rockefellers, studio heads, etc. (Until celebrities started making absurd amounts of money) Yet Africans, Chinese and Japanese were here longer than Eastern and South European immigrants. For the "white" people who "failed" and minorities, did they just not work as hard as the people who did make it?  The myth of meritocracy, to Marxist theorists, is a veil that disguises the institutional inequalites that perpetuates the class status of the elite. It's the whole, "People are rich and powerful, because they worked for it," rationale. Does the labor of a single mother working 2 jobs to feed and support her kids mean less than the work of an executive who's father founded the company? This system exploits the labor of the poor. Not just domestically, but internationally. Some say... "If corporations didn't go to 3rd World Countries, then people wouldn't have jobs." Jobs are one thing, but putting them in a system of little social mobility is another.  Is it a coincidence that our elected officials come from some of the richest families in the country?   Just a little rant... I should finish my reading on the Haitian Revolution.  ***

      I'm so damn tired... thankfully I have left overs from last night to fill me up. Thursdays are absolutely brutal for me. 8+ hours on campus today...  So I decided to submit my paper from 192w last year to the ALBA essay contest. With a $500 booty, I will more than recoup my costs from doing all the research. I talked to Nick about ideas that I might implement into the paper.. he also suggested that if I've put so much effort into it, and I'm going to put more into it... that I should polish it up to a point where I might want to try to get it published. We'll see... I have a month and a half to work on revisions.  I got  Donnie Darko  from NetFlix today... I wonder if I should watch it tonight?  Tomorrow... I need to pay the bank a visit, go grocery shopping, do some reading, and buy Interpol tickets. I should also get to work on a paper for 602 and start thinking about what I wanna do for my 690 research project.  **

      Damn it...  Brotherhood of the Wolf  was scratched up and I couldn't watch the last 45 minutes of it. It was just starting to speed up in pace too!  So far I've liked the movie... what I like most is the historical context. True it's fictional, but that they did try to add some historical realism to it. I thought the discussion of race was interesting. That is the film is set in the 1760s and the French nobles were discussing the issue of "race." I put the word in quotations, because the modern concept of race, that is a combination of phenotype and genetics wasn't prevalent outside of slave societies yet. I'm not sure if many people outside of people who study this stuff realize, but the modern concept of race didn't exist until the 19th century... that is not to say that there wasn't ethnocentrism and genocide occuring in the centuries prior. However, I would argue that it was based on religion and ethnocentrism more than anything.  Of course, while things are changing for the better... we still live under the shadow of one of the worst things humans have ever created. Just look at Trent Lott's recent comments at Strom Thurmand's birthday party, or senator Howard Coble's comments that Japanese internment during WWII was alright. Racial profling for Arab Americans... we still live in a world that still defines people by the color of their skin. This is a complex social construction that not only permeates macro things such as economic inequality and foreign policy, but unfortunately affects people on a social psychological level...   I think the social psychological level is facsinating in that gender and race are correlated in terms of stereotypes of sexuality. The most obvious ones are that Asian women are fetishized and African-American men are believed to have sexual prowess. (These notions are of course absurd... and coming from an Asian male perspective... we got the short end of the stick in terms of all these stereotypes). It's interesting cause these sexual paradigms can be seen to parrallel the visions of Europeans as that conquered Asian and African countries... in the 19th century as well.  That's just my little rant spurred by one little scene from the movie.  ***

       Randy 's  The Human Atom Bombs  is a cool album... with songs like "Proletarian Hop" and "Karl Marx and History" they've got interesting topics that they're singing about. I love that line... "It's war against the classes, the priveledged few against the masses... a Proletarian Hop that just won't stop."  So last night I heard more about the debauchery that went on in Vegas from Stephanie... heh and I relayed some of it to Cissa and Mike on the boards. I also chatted with Laine last night too... I hope her dog is doing better. Hmm... I sure was talking to a lot of Canadians last night.  Let's see... tonight...

Insomnia and idleness always leads to me think about things or people in ways that I shouldn't... I think that's the single thing about myself that I'd really like to change, cause it's doubly unhealthy. The lack of sleep and dwelling... straight up... right now it's a feeling of... well... being lonely. Being close to someone again during winter break, kind of reminded me how nice it was to have someone or at least feel like you potentially do. Yea... this sounds fucking emo... but hey... I'm human too. At least on the bright side... I doing some decent artwork as a result of this.  **

But the $300 ticket back to Binghamton would have sucked... not to mention Sunday would essentially be a waste... west to east flying basically results in a whole day being wasted.  I did some massive downloading last night. Bessides Interpol, I downloaded some more stuff off the  Show and Tell  compilation. I also did some resorting of my mp3s and id3 tagging. I don't know what happened to a bunch of them... their tags got removed somehow.   I need to get a lot of reading done today...

      Man... was I a lazy ass today! I slept most of the day away... I think when it's all said and done, I'll have slept something like 14+ hours today... which means I was awake for less than half the day. That's not to say I didn't do anything productive while I was awake. I managed to do some grocery shopping, painting, and cooking.  Should I just go to Tornonto alone to see  Real McKenzies ? It's $100 round trip for the bus and another $100 for the hotel... seeing Interpol in NYC would be cheaper and more efficient, but I don't think they're all that good. Of couse there's the Surf and Skate thing in Asbury Park, NJ in April...  Alkaline Trio ,  Bouncing Souls , and  Bigwig  are playing the Sunday show. Damn not having a high paying job anymore!   Going back to Interpol... I like the music, but man... the singing... it's not for me. It's too much like that annoying emotive singing from the 80s. If ya didn't know... I usually prefer lyrics with political content... of course not bands I like fit that criteria...   Man...  Real McKenzies ? Celtic punk rock is so much fun. I have some time to think about it.  ***

      I went to the modernism discussion, but not the lecture. The 8 hours of class are just too much.  Netflix says that they never got  Memento  back. Hmm... I mailed it... I hope it doesn't mean that someone jacked it? Well I just watched  Chocolat . Great movie... it's interesting. The modernism class really makes me examine the aspects of modernism in movies and life around me a lot more. How is Chocolat modern you might ask? There certainly is a battle between the traditional life that's very Victorian and the modern sensibilities that Vianne brings to the town. It's the idea that how you live life is an important aspect of living a good life. There's the notion of having the freedom to make your life a good one. I think there's an aspect of consumerism in it though. The fact that a specific commodity - chocolate - is what brings meaning to the lives of the people says something about how the film has modernist themes.  Now of course... I had a question that was brought up by Prof. Elbert's discussion about home decor. From what I remember from another history class... the Victorian home had "souvenirs" that one gathered from things that you did. It can be argued that the Rothko replica was a souvenir, in that is has a "memory" to it. It is true that its value as an original is gone as it is a replica that would later be replicated again in a film. How is "memory" different in the Victorian era, from the Modern era?  In rotation lately has been some old school punk...  X  and  Dead Kennedys .  ***

      Ok... so I didn't get my ass up... didn't go to sleep until 4 AM... damn it!  I don't get why frozen hashbrowns don't brown very well... I know nothing beats fresh potatoes for making hashbrowns, but damn it frozen makes it so I don't have to spend an extra 15 minutes skinning and chopping potatoes in the morning. I need to pick up eggs on Friday.  I've also been playing alot with my Amazon  urlLink wish list . I've got a bunch of stuff in there now. I also have been rating stuff like crazy there too.  My plan for today is to go get the art history reading photocopied, and then finish the Berman reading. I'll probably take breaks and read some more of the C.L.R James book on the Haitian revolution too.  In terms of what Prof. Keyder was talking about yesterday on area papers... I'm pretty set on this whole modernism and post-modernism thing. Maybe something about cultural and knowledge flows and changes in epistemology during those time period on a world-historical level?  For my aural enjoyment right now is  Bad Religion 's "The Same Person" from their  No Substance  CD.  ***

It was alright... when I sobered up... I started getting really bored. So I started a mosh pit with Jeff and some others. Then I was crushing beer cans on my head. When I get bored... I always get lots of stupid ideas in my head.   Yesterday... I did very little. I managed to squeeze in 30 pages of reading and start a painting though... but I slept most of the day and sat around on online most of the day.  WWE is in town today, but I'm not going. Money is the reason. I wish I could go downtown and wander around to see if I can run into Goldust or someone... that'd rule!  ***

      I just saw  American Psycho . Man.. that movie is quite a trip. I think it's interesting in that it says something about the sterility of society at certain levels. The dehumanizing drudgery of the so-called successful life can be seen in Patrick Bateman's life. He's just like everyone else around him, and everyone else around him is just like him. His brutal killing spree and rampant sex to me in such an environment says to me that the movie adapted from a book has a class commentary aspected to. It's a twisted movie, but very interesting.  ***

      Ok so last night I went to a dinner party at Cora's, which was nice. Then Junji, Fumi and I went to Hooters to watch some of Wrestlemania. I only caught Triple H / Booker T, Hulk Hogan / Vince McMahon, and The Rock / Steve Austin. It was nice since I haven't watched wrestling in a while, but I was bummed that I missed Brock vs. Angle. Oh well... someday I'll rent the DVD of the event.  I also got a decent amount of studying in yesterday as well. The Fine Arts library is a nice place to study. I think I'll do it there more.  Hmm... my mood today? I'm feeling kind of whatever today. I'm realizing that I have a lot of shit to get done in the next few weeks. I especially have to get my housing situation squared away.  Now playing is Culture Club's "Karma Chameleon."  ***

       Screeching Weasel  is a pretty darn awesome band, I've been listening to  My Brain Hurts  (1991) today. I mean, I've always they were cool... but it's like my appreciation for them grows with each listen.  My plan is to get on the 2:20 bus to campus and get some reading done. Then I'll come home around 6-ish. Eat and call some friends up to see if they want to see WM. If they don't want to, then it's  American Psycho  tonight.  ***

      Oh yea...  Social Distortion  always makes me wanna drink. Unforunately my stomach is still quite full from the rather large dinner I had.  "Take away... take away... take away this ball and chain... I'm sick and I'm tired and I can't take anymore pain."  I've also been listening to ever so silly "Olympia, WA" by  Rancid .  "Hanging out with Lars down on 6th, he knew I was in trouble... I was feeling much like the devil."

      I just saw  Loser  (2000). Why'd I rent it? Well those cheesy teen / college comedys are usually amusing. This moving was whatever. Even the cameos by Andy Dick and David Spade were whatever. I can't say there were any gags that really stood out even.   I have  American Psycho  sitting on my dresser, which I'll watch tomorrow. I think that should be much better than the trite movies I've been watching lately... well no  Trainspotting  wasn't. I should probably check my NetFlix queue. Heh... queue... I remember hearing that word in England in the first time under the English context of standing in line. One of the reason's why I rented  Loser  is because that Wheatus song was kind of big in England, when I was there seemingly ages ago.   I've actually been thinking a lot about England due to my art history class. It's weird, yet so cool to learn about places I've actually been. I reminds me of that awesome summer... and I'm looking forward to the upcoming summer. I miss my friends, concerts, and California.  ***

      What am I doing up at around 3:20 AM? I have no fucking idea... maybe it had something to do with several naps throughout the day? Man... I'm gonna feel like shit tommorrow.  Anyway I've got cookie dough in the fridge, notes for my presentation in 7 hrs written, and some random stuff typed out for my art history paper. Not totally unproductive of a weekend! Anyway... I think I can probably merge some of the stuff from that paper into one of the papers for 602. I'll probably toss something into the short paper I have to do for 603 also.   Nothing else is really new. Civ3 is a nice way of dulling the boredom, by taking my mind away from me.   Oh yea... I formated one of my hard drives and it runs so much smoother now. OK... note to self... no more Windows updates!  **

      I just saw  A.I. . Wow that was an eerie yet touching movie. Eerie in that David being a machine was so artificial, annoying, and scary in his displays of affection, yet you couldn't help but feel bad for him. I think the movie speaks a load about the human condition, in that so often we desire that thing called love, which is something we can't control. It's because it is something that is so tied to our sense of self. That is the things that we love define who we are and what we do with our lives. For David it was the search for reciprocated love from his mother. However, I couldn't get over the conclusion of the film and realize that David is still just a machine and his mother isn't real at that point (that is unless the aliens changed him, as he was crying in the end).   I spent most of the day today on campus downloading and I checked out the Lynn Spigel book on TV and the American family. I need to read the Rodney book seeing as how I need to present on it on Monday. Man... so much to do, so little time.  I think I'm going to stop buying that Walmart honey bbq chicken. It always seems like the first one is good, and each progressing thigh is worse. I dunno.   ***

      I got tired of posting in poltical threads on the message boards. It's because I'm increasingly pissed off and offended at how ignorant people are on both sides. It's childish and is an example of what goes on, on a global scale. The world doesn't work in black and white. Truth is subjective in that facts need to be interpreted, and the facts themselves are tainted by presentation. People do make valid points about having the war, but most make ignorant statements that don't take into account so many other variables floating around out there.  **

      I just watched  The New Guy . I actually liked the movie. It's not brilliant and probably won't be memorable; however, all the cameos and some decent comedic moments made it entertaining. For example appearances by Vanilla Ice, Henry Rollins, Tommy Lee, David Hasselhoff and Jerry O'Connell were cool. I actually noticed some  Black Flag  graffiti on the wall of the prison cell where Luther and Dizzy stayed.  Also, Eliza Dushku wasn't all that appealing to me when she was on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Well, she was an appealing character in some ways, but in terms of looks. Anyway, she looked pretty good in this movie.  My plans for the weekend... although I never follow my plans... is to get readings done and bake some cookies.  ***

      I just watched  Blade II . Wow that was a pretty good movie. Better than I thought! I've always been a fan of a motley gang of warriors and those reapers were absolutely awesome. I thought it was just as good if not better than the first. Speaking of movies, I saw  Road to Perdition  this weekend at my relatives' place. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I would have liked it if Tom Hanks got bad ass with his Tommy Gun, but alas he didn't. Has Tom Hanks ever tried being an action hero? I think he might be able to pull it off... a Harrison Ford style action hero though. I can't imagine the dude from  Big  whooping ass.  ***

      Being in NJ made me realize something. Sunlight has a big impact on my productivity and mood. Having sunlight enter your room in the morning really makes a big difference in getting your ass up out of bed at a respectable hour. Also it makes you feel less sluggish and energized. Note to self: make sure you have sunlight where you live next year!  Another couple of interesting things... well it looks like a certain someone will probably be going back to Nielsen, thus making my summer laboring quite awkward. Steff told me that the fact that I do think about "burying the hatchet" means that I don't feel like I have closure over the situation (I'm paraphrasing and interpreting here). I think... that is kind of true. Anyway... I'm feeling more curious than worried at this juncture about a lot of things concerning this... simply because the office is going through a lot of changes anyway.  Also I talked to someone from my past as well. It's been almost 2.5 years since I last talked to her. It was whatever... kind of weird though... I mean, the last time I talked to her, Clinton was still the president.  This stuff isn't really weighing on my mind though... more like making me go... hmm?  Oh yea, I rented the Punkorama DVD via NetFlix. It actually isn't bad, but not great like the CDs. A decent mix of old and new videos (made better by being able to turn the subtitles on for lyrics). The extras are alright. I think the history of Epitaph thing would have been better with some old photos not cheesy cartoons of Fletcher starting fires and being surrounded by cops. Oh and there's Greg and Brett on a row boat in Germany in 1992. Greg looks so lame in his stripped tube socks and Cornell hockey t-shirt. If I run into him in a few days when I visit Cornell (finally!) I'm gonna make fun of him... even more so if his hair is still slicked back.  ***

      Wow... I haven't heard  Bad Religion 's "The Dodo" in ages.  Anyway! I got home from NYC a little over an hour ago. It's good to be "home."   So my trip... I got into the city around 2 PM on Friday and wandered about the city until about 5:30, when I took a bus down to NJ. After a bit of bus switching due to my stupid ass getting on the wrong bus at the Port Authority, I got to Ridgewood. The weekend was rather relaxing and nice. It was pretty much just hang around my aunt and uncle's house and going shopping with them. Tuesday morning was when I headed back to the city and spent the day at the Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum.   I found it amusing that there was an installation art project at the Guggenheim that had images of Agnostic Front and Murphy's Law playing inside the Guggenheim. I'm betting 99% of museum goers didn't even know who they were. I don't know how many modern art fans are into hardcore punk.  Oh yea... that Greyhound pit stop 15 miles out of Binghamton pisses me off to no end... so close to home... we don't need to take a damn 15 minute break.  ***

      If the high is 32º and the low is 26º, how the hell can it be 0º?  Another 45 minutes to kill before I take off. I'm not gonna lie to myself, I really wish things were different in a lot of regards to a certain someone. I most defineately liked her more than anyone else I've met since high school. That's not me talking in the here and now, but there's something about her that makes it feel like she embodies so much of things I admire and like. I'm not wallowing in self-pity, actually when I think about certain things about her it still brings a smile to my face.   Hopefully a couple of days out of town within the next week will recharge me and get me looking forward rather than looking backward.

      I just watched  Run Lola Run . A fascinating movie. I've been watching a lot of movies with existential themes huh? People talk about how the film suggests that a few seconds within a 20 minute time span can have massive reprucussions. I think it also suggests that events in reality have a chaotic nature as well, specifically in the realm of human emotion. For example Lola and her father's emotions varied dramatically, that is in the first "part" her father doesn't give a shit about Lola, yet in the third "part" they have a touching moment in the ambulance. Essentially what I'm talking about the trajectory of human events and how the course is erratic. Like Marx says in the 18th Brumaire, "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please."  I think I'm all packed except for toothpaste and razors for NY. The change of scenary will be nice.  ***

      "North Korea is a different case.

      So in class today, my mind wandered and I just had to rant a bit more. I don't know if who I'll be talking about reads this. I doubt she does... but I dunno, someday she might hear a revised version of what I'm gonna rant about. I really feel embrassed, guilty, and upset at myself for ruining a friendship that I felt was really great. I feel like I fucked up. She's really giving me the impression that I'm continuing to fuck up and I feel really shitty about it. I don't know what it is. Is it that my words are coming out in a way that's offending her? Or I dunno... did I fuck things up so much that when we talk, it's awkward? I don't know. Is it something on her side of things?  I honestly have the highest regard for her. I still think she's an amazing person and I'm happy for her that she's happy. I've rarely ever heard her utter the words that she's happy in the time that we've talked... and it's great to see. I genuinely care about her and perhaps the fact that I care about her is the reason why I'm so upset that things are the way they are. I don't want a burnt bridge.  **

      So last night I felt like I got a bit of attitude from someone. I've always been someone who is will to accept my own mistakes and errors. However, on the flipside that makes me feel really offended when I get attitude when I don't feel like I deserve it. Now... I can see where she's coming from, but it fucking feels like she's been taking a lot of things that I say wrong since January. I just made a comment on taking caring of oneself. I don't remember getting any attitude in the past for little comments made in passing before. I don't know if she realizes how fucking guilty I feel for dammaging our friendship in the past... and I've really worked hard to put emotions aside so that we can go back to being friends. I think that makes me a bit more offended.   Am I being sensitive? I dunno... maybe I am. I haven't exactly been a happy person as of late...   **

      I just watched the  Maltese Falcon  (1941). It was... um... well ok... of course it's an old movie. 62 years old to be exact, so the acting was the typical melodramatic fare of the era. Actually the cheesy acting is like what they were poking fun at in  Pleasantville . American popular media was in an interest state of ups and downs in self censorship up until relatively recently. Anyway, the  Maltese Falcon  is supposed to be one of the earliest "fim noir" films, and perhaps the first "film noir" detective flick. What makes it "film noir?" Well the rough edged hero is one aspect, as well as the generally darker mood. That's something you start to feel once you get past the hokiness of the acting from the era. Sam Spade is rough. He doesn't show emotion and sometimes you wonder what his intentions are. I think that's what makes him cool. I also dug the movie, because of all the spoofs that have come from it. Quest for Glory and Animaniacs being some. I enjoyed it... but it's not exactly my favorite old movie. I think I'm gonna try to rent more old movies.  So today I managed to do some reading in Economies of Sign and Space and on city planning. Interesting stuff. At least I got some productivity in right?  Feeling quite tired... I think that's what junk food does to ya...  ***

But yea... writing on campus is a helluva lot more productive than at home. I'm also wondering if these Macs play DVDs... I could watch my Netflix movies here. Hmm... then my subscription won't go to waste in this last week.  I wish I could listen to  Rancid 's "Salvation" and the  Descendents ' "Suburban Home" right now.  Inspiration for my paper.  I'm going to go and copy stuff for 697 right now, go home and have dinner, and then come back to get more shit done. I also plan on baking some cookies tonight.  ***

      Ok well... yesterday I went up to Ithaca's Best Buy to see if anything can be done about my computer. But due to the 2 week turn around time for repairs, I couldn't risk having them ship it off for repair. I did manage to get my data recovered... at a cost.  It was a beautiful drive at least. The weather was awesome... too bad I couldn't get a hold of Kathy and Eric while I was up there.  I ended up going to Edigan's with Jeff, Wataru, Jeff's friend, and the Turks. It was cool... lots of beer. Afterwards I talked to Steff about the plans for Europe next year... that should be lots of fun... also we'll probably go to Vegas this summer to celebrate our birthdays.  Today was just a whatever day. I returned the car and hung out on campus. I wrote:   602 - 5 / 30  603 - 6 / 7  690F - 11 / 15 : completed one page today  Total - 22 / 52 = 42.3% completed with 15 more days to go.   I'm gonna go home now and eat dinner, then come back to get more work done.  **

      I'm so screwed because my laptop is crap. I have no access to 20 out 52 pages of writing on my laptop. Due in 2 weeks.  I need to figure out someway to get to Ithaca today to get it serviced.  Life kind of sucks right now.  *

      I've been having some really fucked up dreams as of late. Last night it was like something out of Matthew Barney's Cremaster... I was basically in a trippy 18th century English estate. I was battling an evil warlock and I had friends all over the place in the place. One part that was kind of off was Laine winning some sort of Star Search thing on a TV that was in the place. Hah... Laine if you're reading this. I didn't know you can sing and dance like that! Anyway... eventually I made it out to the garden where I can to slash away with a sword at plants trying to grab me and wolves.   Earlier this week I had to battle a ghost. I was swinging a bad around violently.  I really think I can get my 690F paper and 603 papers done this week. I'll be going to campus to work on my papers later.  ***

      Ok... I haven't gotten work done the past 2 days... well Wednesday I did do a bunch of reading.  I dunno... yesterday was just a really long day. I ended up checking out books after class, going home and watching  Escape from New York  and having a beer.  Escape From NY starts with some terrorists hijacking an airplane and crashing it in NYC, because the US is an imperialist and has become a police state. It came out in 1981, 20 years before... well you know...  Today I just did some grocery shopping, napped, and watched  Dude Where's My Car . It was an alright movie and had me chuckling a few times. I think it's funny in the tradition of movies such as  Bubble Boy . Although Bubble Boy was much more crass in its politically uncorrectness. Dude Where's My Car just made fun of stoners, jocks, Asians, Nordic people, nerds and handicapped kids, and new age folks. Hmm... ok maybe it's just as politically uncorrect.  Cissa asked if I wanted to go to Europe with her and Steff next summer. Wow if it actually happens, then it'll be going back to Europe with Steff since we met in England in what would be 3 years at that point. That should be fun...especially if, as I'm sure she will, has Mike go too. As great as those girls are, and me being used to dealing with estrogen... I could really use a fellow dude to hang with as the girls shop or something like that.  In other news... I discovered boiling chicken is great for making stock / broth for soup and making the meat extremely tender for shredding. That means chicken quesadillas! I think I shall have another right now!  ***

      I just watched  Fiddler on the Roof . Pretty good movie. It kind of reminded me of  To Live . Only it's about Russia not China.   I got a bunch of reading done today, but no writing. I think I'm really gonna cram in some writing this week. My goal is that in the next week or so I'll have my papers for 603 and 690F done. 8 pages in a week should not be a problem. Actually I hope to get it done this weekend... maybe. That gives me one week of revisions for those papers.  For 602, I'll probably take an incomplete, but I hope to have at least half of the writing done before I leave here.  I made some chicken today... it was alright. I think I've decided that I like chicken fried and in sandwich format the most. That is nuggets, strips, and fried pieces, or a grilled breast in a sandwich. Well... El Pollo Loco's chicken tostada salad is pretty damn good.  **

      Um so yea... I really need to readjust my sleep patterns so I wake up earlier.  I need to get a bunch of reading done tonight for 697 and go to VizCult tonight.  Last night I downloaded some  Unwritten Law . Their self-titled from 1998. That's actually a pretty good album. They had more edge on that release. "Teenage Suicide" is a good example. It's just a killer song.  Other thoughts? I just feel so whatever right now. I feel like I'm just trying to get to the  Millencolin  show and back California. Everything else is simply just so plain right now. I mean it's exactly 3 weeks, 21 days, until I'm home. I still have a lot of work to get done... 33 pages of writing... but with the dreary weather... I have no energy or anything to balance the work with. I'm the type of person, who without balance in all aspects of life, can't get anything done.  **

      I'm on campus doing some writing. So far so good:  602 - 5 / 30  603 - 6 / 7 : completed one page today  690F - 8 / 15 : completed one page today Total - 19 / 52 = 36.5% completed with 22 more days to go.   I'd like to say that  Social Distortion 's  Live at the Roxy  is so much better than their studio stuff. Granted, their earlier stuff was done in ghetto punk rock fashion. However, there's so much more energy on their live album. I've seen Social D once, but not where they were headlining. I think next year, if I'm in town that is... I have to go to one of their HOB shows.  Oh yea... no  Tarzan  today in class... gotta wait until Thursday.  ***

Fucking Netflix screwing me over on movies this weekend. I was supposed to get a movie Friday and one Saturday... but no! Bastards!  I think I'm gonna integrate some popular culture into my paper on suburbs. Such as an episode of  The X-Files ,  Suburban Commando , and  The Burbs . Well I dunno about Suburban Commando, but the title of the X-Files episode "Arcadia" says it all.  16 days until  Millencolin .  **

      Damn it... I've been having problems with my drive kit the past few days. I wonder what the fuck is wrong with it.  I did get groceries today, but I forgot to get foil... damn it. Then I missed the bus home, so I had to hike 3 miles home. It was a good workout at least... carrying... um... 20 lbs of groceries? It was 1 carton of juice, 1 2 liter of soda, 1 small thing of laundry detergent, eggs, bread, limes, tomato, chicken, and hashbrowns. So yea... the weight of the fluids really added up.  I did some fiddling with my papers, but nothing substantial. I simply feel lazy today. I slept for a couple hours after my hike. Then made the key lime pie. Then got pissed off at my drive kit some more. Oh! and no netflix movies today!   Fucking it wasn't a good day.  **

      Man... last night... I went over to Jeff's place for dinner and I had 3 bottles of Guinness and 3 shots of vodka. Then we went to the Turks' place and I had some Budweiser, and then to the Belmar for some Bass. Then we went to KFC... Kennedy Fried Chicken. Needless to say my stomach was full and my head was spinning at the end of the night.  Gotta write and grocery shop today.  ***

      Last night I watched  Minority Report . It was a pretty good movie and did a pretty good job creating a future world of 2054.  I have all of  AFI 's  Sing the Sorrow  downloaded now. I think it's pretty good. I think it's better overall than  Black Sails in the Sunset  and  Art of Drowning  in that it's easier to listen all the way through. The other 2 albums had awesome tracks, but I found that there were a lot of tracks that I was skipping over.  Today I'll probably go to campus and do some writing and go drinking with Jeff.  **

I have 9 our of 52 done, which means I have 31 days to get 43 pages written. That means I need to write 1-2 pages a day to get all my papers done before I go home.   Oh yea... you know you're an academic when you feel happy discovering something useful about suburbs in Max Weber's massive  Economy and Society .  ***

      I just managed to squeeze out 2 pages for one my 602 papers. That makes 4 out of 30 done for that class, and 4 out of 15 done for art history.  It's better than nothing, but I could be more productive... then again it is still early. I really need to get on that Shepperson book... the subject matter is just so not what I'm into.  Ok so I've been think a lot about how  Bad Religion  is being challenged for its spot as my favorite band. Particularly by  Anti-Flag ,  T(I)NC , and  Randy . Let's take a look at these bands in depth...  1 -  Bad Religion ... I've been a fan since 1993/4. They've been around since 1980, when I was born and I've seen them 3 times. In terms of music and message, they don't seem as radical as I used to back in high school.  The Process of Belief  was an amazing album in that it really got to me on topics such as questioning religion, society, and the environmental issues. However, as my own politics stray further left... their asking of questions and not being polemical doesn't resonate with me as much as the other bands. But, Bad Religion has a nostalgia to them that the other bands don't have.  2 & 3 -  The (International) Noise Conspiracy  and  Randy  are tied for second and third place right now. These are two killer bands from Sweden with revolutionary messages embedded in their songs. However, they do it with such amazing style. Actually T(I)NC might have the edge, because I've seen them live twice compared to zero for Randy... and T(I)NC is significantly better than BR live. T(I)NC is jazzy and charismatic in their ripping up of capitalist ideology. Randy is good ol' rock 'n roll fun as they gleefully sing about revolution.   4 -  Anti-Flag  is angry and their sound is militant. I rank them lower than T(I)NC and Randy, simply because they don't get the style points the Swedes do. However, their being angry and the fucked up stuff in the world gets me going. They make me want to mosh or punch a hole in a wall. T(I)NC and Randy actually make me want to dance (and I hate dancing). Bad Religion makes me want to think as I sing along.  Bad Religion is playing a show in Long Island next weekend, and I'm not going... but for T(I)NC or Randy I think I would, but not Anti-Flag... I dunno... I guess it's tough deciding what your  favorite  is.  ***

      So last night I went to the TASC banquet. It was alright. The food was decent and some of the performances were good too. I saw Nick there and got a ride home from him. He's a cool guy that might be fun to hang out with more... although it was kind of weird him suggesting that I  meet  one of his students.   Damn the city bus today... so I was waiting at the bus stop at 1:20 PM so I could go get some pastrami, beer, and whatever... well I gave up on waiting and the bus didn't get there until 1:45. I gave up, because the bus heading home leave the stop near Giant at the hour... that leaves me either no time to shop or I'll have to wait forever to get home. Oh well I guess being at home gave me a chance to lend an ear to Michelle and Steff on their guy troubles / issues.   Hmm maybe continuing the negativity... the AA MOTW has some really horrific images of the AIDS epidemic in Southeast Asia and Africa. It was less than a week ago that Wataru and I were discussing what a fucked up situation it is. Sure we were joking that the CIA was using AIDS as population control to keep those peoples from revolting... but seriously the MOTW made a good point about how all of suddent people are talking about SARS in rich countries. While AIDS research has increased, aid is being given to Africa, etc. It has to be understood that it takes more than just medicine to solve the problems in these areas of the world. The social relations as well has political / economic structures of these places have disintegrated to the point that AIDS has been able to run rampant. Our media in the developed world never mentions how we have a hand in the destruction of these societies in terms of monetary policy and stuff. Ok... I'll just stop... no need to write a massive paper...  It is a beautiful day out by the way...  ***

      Yesterday I woke up late and was late to class... then had a pretty decent day. That CEMERS talk was kind of stale. The speaker is a better photographer than speaker. Afterwards I decided to watch  Bottle Rocket  instead of going to the Belmar. That didn't mean I didn't have some beer. Well I have beer every night...  Anyway  Bottle Rocket , I liked it better than  Royal Tennenbaums  and  Rushmore ... despite Bill Murray not being in it. The characters weren't as interesting, but the story was more amusing.   Yea... I woke up late again today. It's really the weather! I'm just itching for warmer and sunnier days to appear. This weekend I hope to get some writing done.  Tonight I'm going to a TASC banquet. That should be good... for the food anyway.  **

I went to VizCult and secured an apartment here at Hayes for next year. Tomorrow I have 697, sitting in on history, and maybe going to the talk on the Russian Monastery done by CEMERS. I kind of wanna go out drinking again tomorrow night also. We'll see.  Fries in the oven... and gonna have my last bottle of Newcastle. Nice, but being productive would be nicer.  ***

      I just watched  The Others . Really weird timing to see it the day after... well... being in touch with someone I never thought I'd ever talk to again. It was a good movie. I suppose the ending was spoiled earlier by other people, but it was still good. I can see how people make a connection to 6th Sense and talk about how they saw the ghost thing a bit earlier. Something I'm a little unsure about is why Nicole Kidman's character killed the kids. Was it because her husband died in the war and she went nuts?  Anyway... going back to that someone I never thought I'd talk to again... I'm not sure how I feel about it. I felt like I had to make first contact, because well I might have to work under her. I guess I had to show something... but I think things will still be awkward. There's no escaping that I think. I feel awkward just thinking about it.  I'm just totally lacking energy today. It's almost 11 and I just want to lay down and go to bed. I should get shit done though... we'll see.  **

      I've been having the problem lately of waking up and my body not wanting to respond, because it felt like it just worked out hard. It's akin to the mornings after wrestling tournaments, only without the soreness. I think it's a combination of my eating habits, the bad weather, and lack of working out. In my sleep I'm restless because of that.  So as a result I ditched 603. I just couldn't pull myself up. I could barely hit the snooze button.  **

      Today was such a waste of a day... I did jack shit... well I did do my laundry.  I just slept a lot and watched  The Cell . That movie was trippy, but not as bad as people made it out to be. Movies like Seven and 8mm were way worse. 8mm is the only movie I can say really disturbed me when I saw it. I was disturbed by the intensity, suspense, and imagery. For the Cell, there was some crazy imagery, but the suspense and intensity wasn't there.   I'm making myself some tea right now so that I can try to get some work done.  Oh yea... why the hell are we gonna get a foot of snow tomorrow... it's fucking April!  **

      My little dinner party turned out alright. It ended up being just the guys. We had some clam chowder, seafood pasta, and key lime pie. I'm surprised at how simple key lime pie is and how damn good it is.  I felt like the lay out of the menu worked quite well. The seafood and citrus combo. It was sort of transition from purely seafoody to more and more citrusy. Also it started and ended creamy. It helped that we had Corona with limes too.  I like doing the whole dinner party thing. I totally miss having them with the Cambridge girls. Perhaps we should have a little reunion thing this summer? I can always see if Mike, Jimmy, and Esther can make it?  Should I watch  The Cell  tonight?  ****

      I got my  Randy  shirt in the mail yesterday. It's 100% organic non-slave labor cotton, because it's from  Propagandhi 's G7 Welcoming Committee. Those hippy Canadian commies. It fits weird. It's long and has narrow shoulders. I guess it's 'cause lots of tall skinny vegans buy their stuff?  The rain has really drained me of energy and thus my productivity.

      Thursdays in general are long days. Yesterday was particularly bad in that, because I was feeling kind of tired... I had massive amounts of coffee and soda, which resulted in a lot of pissing throughout the day. Then after the art history class, I went out for drinks with Elena. So beer and many caffeinated beverages throughout the day meant a lot of urine.   ***

      Listening to some  Red Hot Chili Peppers  right now. The thing with RHCP for me is that it takes a while for me to start liking their stuff. Usually the first time I hear their stuff, I don't like it that much. Then it grows on me. It's that way with all the garage bands too. I remember thinking  T(I)NC  and  Randy  were annoying.. but now they're some of my favorites. I decided that for my dinner party Saturday night, I'm gonna bust out all my Marxist music. It will be all sociology students after all!  Man... didn't get much reading done last night. Fuck... class at 10...  **

      I had Junji over for dinner tonight. It was nice having company for dinner for a change. We had dinner, a couple of beers, and talked about the lack off fine women here in Binghamton. I think that's a problem for me and lets me dwell on girls back in California that I can't have or I might not be interested in if I wasn't here. It's hard because I'm picky enough as it is. That's not to say I haven't met some interesting and decent looking women here, but no one has really caught my attention.  For example there's this cute girl that works in the reserve room, but after overhearing her talking to someone else working there (as I did some stapling)... she seemed so uninteresting. Few girls in the history of my life have been really interesting to me. I think if I were to get involved with some of my options here... it'd be like it was with Trang... content, but not necessarily happy. Then again being content might be nice.  Time to get some reading done.  **

      I watched  About A Boy ... since lots of people said it was good. It is quite good.   I also managed to get writing done last night. Wow last night was productive! Watched a movie, studied, and did some writing! I'm so proud of myself!  Today I need to drop off a book for Stephanie (2) and do some grocery shopping. I'm thinking of making key lime pie.  ***

      I'm proud of myself. I've been productive lately. I got in a good hour and a half of study time in the art library. That's such a great place to study. It's clean and brand new. Well lit and has excellent bathroom facitilities.  It's such a mood booster to know you're actually doing something productive with your time.   Ok so my plans for the rest of the night are to make dinner, do some writing, and watch  About A Boy .  ***

      I had some weird dreams last night. Something about fear of bad yogurt contaminating my smoothie and another one with sex with someone who I would prefer not to think about in that way. Ok well maybe I wouldn't mind thinking about her that way, but my rational mind tells me that's a bad route to go down.  Ok yesterday was kind of a lazy day. I guess it had to do with the nast snowy weather. My plan for today is class at 2:50 and then study in the library afterwards.  Listing to some  Propagandhi  right now... yesterday's class reminded me of "And We Thought Nation-States Were A Good Idea."  ***

      I went for a run this morning and then made mysel some potatoes and eggs for breakfast... I'm kind of tired right now.  Over at my  urlLink Xanga  page I've been collecting new quotes to be added to my quote of the day javascript for this page. Right now I have the script alternating between 2 files with 31 quotes for odd and even months. However, I'm going to be sticking in a third file so that it alternates between 3 files. That means it'll be 3 months before a quote is repeated. I doubt anyone comes to my page daily, but you never know. The script might become super useful some day.  Today I'm just going to sit around and get some reading done. I should try to get Prigogine done today. It's do-able. I've read 100 pages in a day before... hell I've done more than that. Also, Thelma is supposed to call about my updated work schedule sometime today. Also George and I are suppose to do some grilling of meat later.   Oh yea... looks like I'll be seeing 3 shows in a 1 week span of time next month!  6/10 -  Alkaline Trio  &  One Man Army  @ Canes 6/12 -  Dropkick Murphys  @ Key Club 6/17 -  AM Radio  & Rooney @ HOB Anaheim... to celebrate Steff's Birthday.  Now playing  Offspring 's "Get it Right" from  Ignition .  ***

      Work was busy for the first 2.5 hours... but the last 1.5 was boring. Afterwards I dropped of an old car battery at K-Mart to get a deposit back for my mom's car and then went to the new Albertson's on Jeffrey to pick up pictures and groceries. I was so needing stuff to cook. I feel so unhealthy eating like I was. Junk food at work and at home... bleh.. I'm such a health nut after living on my own. I'm gonna be making some seafood pasta tomorrow too. I wonder if I should invite some friends over to join me?  Now playing  Rancid 's "Salvation" from  Let's Go ... that reminds me that I want to get cracking on my papers.  ***

      Something that crossed my mind today was the topic of how I can be a better person. Bessides the whole slacking off on jogging this weekend and not eating healthy since I've been back... I think I should try to be a better person. I don't think I'm necessarily mean... especially compared to some friends, but I have a horrible habit of analyzing people and noticing their "quirks." This includes people who are important to me on all levels, which makes me feel guilty about doing that. I guess being a sociologist the whole analyzing thing comes in handy, but I think at times I do it at inappropriate times and oftentimes I should just keep my mouth shut. As G.I. Joe says... "knowing is half the battle." I know this is a flaw, but I have another half of the battle to go.  I've got work tomorrow at 11 AM... I get to sit around alone in the office... fun eh?  Oh yea... fucking QG4 has a damn error that keeps me from finishing the game.  ***

      Fuck I just lost my blog due to this crappy modem.  Ok... well I had an awesome week up until that. I've done some jogging in the morning, which I've been able to do since I'm still someone on eastern time. Then I started working again on Tuesday. It's great to see familiar faces and do new things like learn about the new market. I also got to go to a meeting at the Marriott. I also went out drinking Friday night with a bunch of friends in Costa Mesa / Newport. It was cool, because I never really got to check out bars in OC before. Well I got home a little before 4 and then went to work at 9. After a brutal day of work from being tired, I pretty much went straight down to SD with Brandon for a BBQ at Andy's.  So it was a good week. I had a lot of fun.  ****

      Today was cool. I had brunch with the girls and watched Matrix 2 with some of them. It was cool for the whole gang to be back together.  Matrix was awesome. I didn't think it was confusing at all. There are little things that I had questions about, but they're minor sci-fi nerd questions. It was basically the all so common sci-fi question about destiny... are you meant to do what you're doing? or do you have choice? It's like the paradox of time travel. Are events of the present a result of you going back and making it happen? or would it have been different? It's kind of existential. Exactly how do you live your life? I read Sartre's "No Exit" today and it addresses some of those issues. Is existence being able to make choices or not? Of course for Sartre it's making choices. Then again there's the ever so famous Marx quote that "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please."  As Sartre says... "Tu n'es rien d'autre que ta vie" - - "You are nothing but your life." As Merovingian says... "It's like like wiping your ass with silk" in regards to speaking in French.  ****

      Home again... home again. I got home yesterday. It's great to be back.  The novelty of flying is gone. A 1 hr flight followed by a 1 hr layover and then a 5 hour flight is brutal. After I got home I ate and took my laptop to Best Buy for repairs. Then I napped a bit before finally delivering the tea and spoon to Steff. Then Steff and I went grocery shopping. It was fun... that girl was fondling all the stuff in the store... like the cakes, tofu, etc. Then I napped some more and I was able to watch Smackdown for the first time in ages.  It's great to be home.  ****

Hopefully she doesn't ask about his experiences in journalism at Berkeley, 'cause then I'd have to further the white lies.  Maybe I should get my ass out of my seat and go to campus today to meet up with Minh-An. I haven't seen that girl since I've been back.

      Writing at work again. So tired again.  Last night George, his friend Sergio and I went to a party at Abby's place. It was cool, except for the whole George and Sergio getting messed up and being dumbasses on the drive back home. I'm just hoping those fools made it home in one piece.  Last night I put on a bit of a show crushing and busting open beer cans... it was just like Sierra Vista again. Fitting as Abby had mentioned that she had heard of my reputation from those days. Bessides hanging out with George and Sergio, there was the crew from the night before and Nelson from the freshman year dorms. I think I have a few more people to be adding to Friendster in the near future.  I've really been running my body into the ground the past few days... or even weeks. Andy is gonna be in OC today, and next weekend is the 4th of July and then it's Vegas. That means a lot of booze. I've been eating horribly and not exercising. I actally feel my strength being sapped.  ***

      Here I am at work... bored and tired. Man... no one is picking up the phone. So I got through all the work with like no appointments set.  I'm tired cause last night I went to the Liquid Lounge in HB with a bunch of folks to send off Flo, before she goes to Texas. Ya know what...  club environments are really annoying for some reason. The artificiality of the whole thing, music I don't like, and I dunno... it was pretty boring at some points. At other points when I was socializing with my buds and other folks, it was cool. Oh and the nipples... yea I saw a lot of nipples that night, between the soft core porn on the screen, the girl flashing the DJ, and girls there dancing in revealing outfits. I think I enjoyed the glimpse of areola on the redhead the most. Other interesting stuff was Naomi and Flo getting really fucked up, and this really cheesy dude hitting on Flo all night.  I got some props on my mohawk too. The bouncer asked me if the mohawk is a New York thing, as he'd never seen an Asian with one before. Also this girl named Marissa (I think) that I came across randomly seemed to really dig the mohawk and my "look." She's all like, "I can tell you're a whatever kind of guy and you don't really give a fuck." She was cool, she was gonna buy me a drink, but alas my friends were leaving. I don't know if she was right about my confidence level, because I think I'm more of an alter ego at times than the real me.  Afterwards we went to Norms and that cheesy dude wouldn't stop with the lame comments. I got home around 3:30 AM.  Being bored is kind of a bad thing for me, because then I get crazy ideas in my head. I was having people punch me in the face last night.  Actually everyone was being a wimp about it. It was kind of fun regardless. To feel the "madness" again. I used to have a reputation as one of the toughest and craziest SOBs around in high school and part of college. Alas I don't have that edge anymore.  ***

      Brandon and I went to get  Vandals  tickets yesterday. We also went to Godfather's and BJs.  Godfather's has the coolest jukebox of any bar I've been to. It actually downloads music it doesn't have. We were laughing our asses off when it played our selection of  Bad Religion 's "I Love My Computer." We also had some Social D and the Police going. I think that machine could be very dangerous if we were really drunk.  We also went to BJs and and some pizza and more beer... BJ's pizza rules. It kicks my homemade pizza to the curb, but then again my pizza is cheaply made.  Tonight I'm going clubbing with the girls, to have some fun before Flo goes off to Texas.  Yes... me going clubbing...  ***

      Is it weird when someone reminds you of someone else? Recently a friend of mine gave me this look that reminded me of a look my ex used to give me. It wasn’t a nasty look, but rather a jolly “what the hell are you doing?” look.   My grammar has gradually gotten worse.  Anyway… I’m quite annoyed that I still don’t have my laptop. It’s been like 2 months!   Pizza... mmm... Pizza... I wanna try kicking the dough up a notch as Emeril would say. I'll call Minh-An later and pick up some cheese for my next pizza.  ***

      Pizza #2 came out so much better. I'm gonna finish the rest of the dough off today!  Vegas is all booked. Only Andy, Jon and Derek are confirmed. Lots of maybes... I think the cheap price will turn them around on it.  Hmm my Winamp has been playing Vanilla Ice and Michael Jackson. Who's more white?  I've been discussing my past with several people as of late. See June 14th for info on that. I'm really curious what really made me calm down. Was it being suspended twice? Was it Trang? Was it simply being tired? I'm quite curious about that. Maybe a little of everything?  ***

      So the pizza crust didn't turn out quite perfectly last night. Oh well... it was my first time.  Last night I hung out with Esther. We went out for a beer in Westwood and did some catching up talk. It was a nice evening with an old friend. I really understood her whole thing about needing something, when there's no show for you to feel a little pain and let go of some aggression. It makes me look forward to seeing the Vandals... that is if someone will just go with me!  Worked today... it was a fairly ok day. That's $60 more for me. I did some chatting with Lisa... not sure why. I guess I can't help but be friendly to my co-workers... even good old Margarita. I think certain people in the company can learn from me... not to be praising myself or anything.  Alas nothing is going on this week, except for hanging out with Flo before she goes to Texas. Perhaps I'll practice violin? Pick up a hobby? It has yet to be determined.  ***

I guess I've got a lot of feelings going on with me right now. The past 2 weeks have just really weird for me.   Some of the stuff that people have told me in recent weeks has just been mind boggling.   Esther made my day or week last night when she said my strength is admirable.   **

      My god... work fucking sucked ass today. It wasn't even funny. A monitor started smoking, appointments were cancelling, the printer wasn't working, the phone system went haywire!  I basically went home and passed out after work. My energy levels are pretty low. Bad eating habits, no exercise, and other craziness has me worn out.  I've been wanting to bake a pizza from scratch of late... I think I'll do that tomorrow.  Counting myself I have 4 people set for Vegas.  Friendster is officially scary now. I now have Gary and Hasani in my personal network. I was linked to Gary by 4 completely unrelated and random people. I was linked via Linda, Minnow, Abby, and Esther. Abby was the only one that made sense since we all went to Sierra Vista, but the other ones were a bit out there. I know Linda through an ITASA thing and she went to CSUF. Minnow is from like San Gabriel and goes to UCSD. Esther, I suppose goes to the same school as Gary... but UCLA is a big f-ing school. The rest of the high school posse find it kind of funny, yet scary.  I'm listening to some  Pulley  right now.  ***

      It's strange working with Lisa. I treat her as if she's just another co-worker. But I can't help but feel weird with her around... especially when I was telling Julia how I'd cuss out Best Buy if they don't fix my laptop. Or how I have problems with a friend of mine.  Lisa and I always had this... serendipity thing between us, where things would always seem to up by accident. We saw that movie together too. Anyway the timing of certain stuff was almost enough for me to almost apologize to her. Something I never would even dream of doing up until today; however, luckily she took off early and people told me more about how they dislike how she does her job. That sort of reminded me of some of the reasons why I cussed her out to begin with. Narrow misses.  I hate burning bridges. There's a self-sabotaging aspect of my personality that I've long struggled with. It's like building the perfect city in Sim City only to ravage it with earthquakes and fires. Thanks to 2 conversations with 2 very cool people last night, I sort of realized I should stop doing that. However... there's something about Lisa in which I don't mind leaving that bridge burned.  I realize I've been naming names a lot more lately. I don't know why. I do realize that Lisa, as a person of authority at work, could make my life hell at Nielsen if she came across this.

      Tonight was interesting. I worked with Lisa for the first time in over a year and it was first time I saw her face to face in a really long time. I guess we were both cordial to one another. It was weird that I treated her just as if she was as any other co-coworkers, despite me still honestly feeling some animosity towards her.  The good thing is that Steff took my apology and basically said that it'll take awhile before things get normal again. I'll take what I can get. The fear is gone, and so is 80% of the shame and guilt. It'll take me awhile to not feel awkward too.  I guess things are looking up.   **

      I want to clear this up for all who read this blog. I, at this point, do not have feelings for her. There was some major confusion a while ago, but that confusion is all gone as all I'm concerned about right now is apologizing to her and trying to make things right.  If I feel anything right now, it's shame, guilt, and fear. Shame and guilt over what happened and fear about losing a friend.  Last night I went to see my friends' band Apocalipstick practice and have dinner. First of all, that dinner was the third meal I'd had in something like 48 hours, because my self-loathing resulted in a reduction of appetite. Second of all I felt really bad because I was hanging out with all our mutual friends plus one of her best friends. Third, we viewed the Cambridge video again for Julia. That of course made me feel weird, because it was good memories combined with wondering if I pissed her off, upset her, etc.  Look if I knew that I pissed of any friend, not just her I'd probably be just as upset. Am I being emo!? Well fuck how would you be feeling if you knew you fucked up big time with a friend. I guess what upsets me most is I have no clue what is going on, on her side of things. 'Cause I have no memory of how she even reacted to my stupidity.  Oh and if it's not bad enough... I'll probably be seeing someone for the first time in over a year, in which the last time we really spoke I cussed her out.  Nice huh?  *

      I should find out the details of the posse BBQ we're gonna do July 4th weekend. It'll be the first time in a year and half we all managed to congregate. The Vandals are playing the 5th... I haven't seen them in a while, so I wouldn't mind seeing them. Especially since I now know the Fiend Fest is $32. Fuck that... Warped has more and better bands and it's $20. The problem is that Warped is in the middle of the week that we might be going to Vegas. Can my body handle that much fun?  ***

      Ok... so... how do you apologize when you don't remember exactly what you said. Well... I have an idea of what  might  have been said seeing as I did have a record of my state of mind due to the blog entry I deleted yesterday.   I'm sure she'll understand... right? I mean being drunk is no excuse, but she's done her share of stupid things drunk before. Maybe I should ask her how to apologize for something you don't really remember. At least Cissa is helping with the damage control.  ***

      My mom just told me a story about running into the mom of someone that I grew up with... it was typical mom talk about what kids are up to. However, my mom said the look on the lady's face was classic when she told her I'm in a phd program right now. It was a look of disbelief apparently... that crazy little Albert is gonna be called professor or doctor.  The irony was that I was just thinking about what a different person I am now compared to how I was growing up. Yea... yea... another nostalgia post.   I once had a reputation of being one of the craziest and toughest mofos around. I can't say I've won every fight, but I've never lost one either. I've dented lockers, 500 page text books, and trash cans with my skull. I've dove out 3rd story windows in addition to diving off stages. I use to not give a fuck and was even dragged out of class for a talk by a school counselor. I've eaten flame, and I've put all sorts of crazy stuff in my mouth. I was suspended twice. I got expelled from Chinese school. I swung a steel pole at a school official. I was a vandal. I let a friend burn my hair, punch and knee me in the head. I didn't even tap when an Olympic wrestler put a front headlock on me. I've picked up a heavyweight and tossed him. I've beat someone down and made him apologize. I laughed when a fat man in black came after me with scissors. My reputation grew to mythic proportions as I was once asked if I really dared someone to run over me with a car. I used to be one crazy and tough mofo, but that story wasn't true... not someone you'd expect to be teaching at a university some day huh?  Now I care about consequences. I care about the implications of my actions. I care about people, especially people close to me. It matters what those close to me think of me, because I value their opinions. Hell, I value everything about them. It's not just about me anymore. If I dove out a window and broke my neck... I know people who'd cry for me. If I'm beaten broken and bloody either by my actions or the actions of others... there'd be those who'd care for me.   For the villian that said caring makes you weak... he's right. But the hero was right about it making you strong too. However, I miss the freedom. I miss the madness and rage. Yet the path to success in this world is not made by being a pyro and burning everything around you.   **

      My highlight for the day is Erica's testimonial on my Friendster account. It reminded me of the good old days at Santiago Hills. Those were some good memories. We were pretty darn good friends in elementary school. And Erica if you're reading this... I too am really really happy we got back in touch.   Oh and what's even more interesting is at a party earlier tonight I ran into the sister of some dude I knew from those days too.  I remember that last year, this whole running into people who know me or that know of me or that I know someone that they know thing was well overwhelming. It made me want to really get the fuck out of Irvine. I remember that night too... it was on Steff's birthday last year. It was just so weird seeing people (who by the way were friends of Erica's back in those days) after almost a decade. This time around it's really sentimental, because I realized that Irvine is... as Evan once put it... home. The fact that at this party I talked to people that I had met at shows and know people I know was cool. It's really a small fucking world. It's like John knowing Dan, Esther knowing Kelly's boyfriend's cousin, or me having met people from people's pasts. As I used to joke with Laine... I'm the center of the universe.  I just tossed around a lot of names... but for the next little section... I just want to say that a recent conversation I had with someone was pretty darn therapeutic. In that I feel like there's a clean slate... ok well it's not really back to square one, zero, or whatever cliche phrase there is out there... but there was stuff I got off my chest that had been pent up for a while. It wasn't anything bad that was pent up, but it was simply some sentiments that feel a lot better out in the open than forever buried deep away. It's nice to tell someone exactly what's on your mind. I think we took what was said well.  ***

      Last night... wow what a fun night. Steff and I went to get Ethiopian food and see the Dropkick Murphys. It was really cool. We went to a different Ethiopian restaurant than the one Naomi N. and I usually go to because I wanted to try a different one... one where the waitress isn't mean. Ethiopian is always good stuff, and Steff really dug it. Then we drove to the Key Club and pre-partied in the car by talking over shots of tequila. Then went into the show. It was a great show. The review is up on my concerts page. My legs are still kind of scratched up from climbing up onto the stage. Then we went back to Irvine and went to Dennys. Not before having more tequila though.   We made it into a sort of early birthday celebration. It was cool with it being us Gemini hanging out. I guess we learned more about one another in one night than over the 2 years we've known each other, which is pretty cool.   It's 9:15 AM right now... I didn't go to sleep until 5 something in the morning... man 4 hours of sleep. I'm supposed to go to the honors convocation to cheer for Naomi R. later and go to a party. Man... I think I've drank every night this week... heavily at that too!  ****

      Today... er... yesterday.. I had my special mushroom and spinach mac n cheese for lunch and Taiko for dinner... a rather healthy day if it was for the sake and beer.  I went to Tijuana's to pass off the Dropkick Murphys CD to Steff and ended up sticking around for some beers while the girls danced. I know I could do the whole dancing thing if I really wanted to, but it's not my thing. There have only been a few times were I really wanted to dance, but of course there was usually a young lady as motivation. Otherwise it's just me going with the flow and hanging out with my good friend beer which always satisfies.  Tomorrow I should call Wild Rivers, and get some reading done before going to the show with Steff. We're supposed to get some Ethiopian food too! Oh man that's gonna rock. That shit tastes good for something so simple. Then it's gonna be some good music.   I've been listing to the DKM for the past 2 days and that new CD is really growing on me. The more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Tomorrow should be eventful.  ***

      Wow a long ass day. George and I left Irvine a bit past 1 PM after paying bevmo a visit... then headed down to UCSD and killed some time, before heading down to Canes.  Man... I had at least 6 shots of tequila and 2 shots of wild turkey 101... in addition to some beer...  The Alkaline Trio show was whatever... that's to the fucking security stopping mosh pit action and tossed people out for it. WTF is up with that. Security should be there to make sure brawls don't happen and people don't get hurt; however, they shouldn't be fucking fascists and take away any sort of action. They were worse than the Galaxy in Santa Ana.   Also Alkaline Trio played almost all new stuff, which many of the fans didn't know. There was a total difference seen in the crowd based on their reactions to old versus new stuff. I mean... when Private Eye hit... people got crazy. The energy went up several notches despite the fucking security guards. They didn't play good shit like Armageddon or Clavicle. One Man Army was good, but the crowd wasn't into them and again security ruined it. We missed the Start and Paris, TX.... oh well.  Man so tired...  ***

      Last night someone said something interesting to me. She said that I should go out with someone that we both know. It was really bizarre. Ok… well not completely bizarre, because I had a hunch those sentiments were there… that she wouldn’t mind if I went out with this person. Also, I can’t say I’ve never ever thought of going out with this person. I think a dude would have to be gay or missing a testicle to not think she good looking. However, it was a long time ago that I even considered it. Also going out with a friend can be quite disastrous, especially when we have common friends. It’s not a simple matter of liking someone or having feelings, but there are far reaching implications. I should know… just take a peak in my blog archives for more info on that.   In less dramatic news... Alkaline Trio and One Man Army tonight at Canes. Going down there with GXG. This is gonna rock.  I'm not sure what my mood is. The whole little situation above has me feeling weird, but the show tonight has me feeling pumped.  ***

      I hung out with the girls last night and did some readings in  Variations on an Amusement Park . So yesterday was a productive day.  We watched Janet's video of the Cambridge trip. Ah the memories... it got me stoked about going to Europe next summer with Steff, Mike and Cissa.   Oh yea... last night had another dream about that certain someone. This time she led me to a smoothie shop and then ditched me. I really don't understand why I dream about her so much. I think I've probably dreamed about her more than any young lady... it's just strange. It's strange cause I normally don't dream of people I know... or people I know are playing different characters than themselves.   Today I plan on reading that consumerism book and try to get some exercise in.  ***

      So last night I dreamed I was in a post-apocalypitic world. I was sort of wandering around feeling kind of shitty, but then I found an apartment in a run down building... and there was someone... a certain someone that made me feel good in that dream. No... not what you're thinking, but rather it simply made me not alone in the post-apocalypitic world. However, then someone else came into the picture and reminded me that she's not available. Kind of a drag of a dream. It's been a while since I've had a dream with her in it... and dreams with her in it always seem to result in negativity. Hopefully I won't have another in a long time.  Speaking of other negativity, my laptop is once again not starting up. Fucking Best Buy better fix it this time.  **

      "I will be there for the wake up and take you back with me... I will wake up with a smile just for you." - Consumed   Normally I don't dig the same old lovey poppy songs that 80% of musicians out there write, but Consumed's "Wake Up With a Smile" is done in an aggressive enough way that it doesn't annoy me. No fucking emo bitch that needs to grow some balls...  Anyway today I got my drive kit replaced and the new one's running great. Afterwards I had lunch with George at Fuddruckers... the home of the best fucking hamburgers. Then I paid the high school a visit... man if I wasn't so out of shape I would have totally whooped Manual's ass. I just just sprawling hard on all his shots and hitting front headlocks... but I didn't have the energy to shoot. Also I didn't want to mess up my clothes, since I was street clothes.  Then it was some AOM and TV... I need to make dinner and do some reading later. I want to get through a few chapters of  Privatopia  tonight.  ***

      Yesterday was a pretty darn productive day. I was on campus for something like 6 hours and I got research done as well as running into familiar faces.   I managed to get a big stack of books from the library and do some reading. I read some of the Poster, Olin, etc. book on how Orange County is post-suburban and some Baudrillard. Really interesting stuff. I need to read more of the "classics" such as Baudrillard, Derrida, Foucault, and Althusser. I'm so behind on that.   On campus I ran into Ev, Ali, Alex, David, Janet, and Mike, and talked to Marc in his office. Not to mention I saw lots of familiar faces on the campus. I guess I've been in Irvine forever so I've got a lot of connections.  Now listening to some  Dropkick Murphys ...  Do or Die . Man... I'm actually looking forward to that more than  Alkaline Trio . It's cause I know it'll be a killer crowd. There should be about 300 very rowdy hardcore Murphys fans there. Heh... I hope Steff can handle it.   Speaking of the Murphys... I forgot to mention that I saw a dude in a kilt wearing a Murphys shirt at Disneyland.  ****

      Disneyland was cool. Short lines, and good company made it cooler. However, at 22... Disneyland is a lot less fantastic than when you were 10, yet... I saw 30 year olds with disney cartoons. It was interesting seeing goth and punk folks too. I thought the coolest thing was seeing a pretty hardcore looking dude with tats all over and a Jim Neidhart goatee and his matching wife with their kids.  I was actually totally planning to get a tattoo this summer, but with the lack of hours... I dunno if I can afford it.  ***

      Last night I watched the  Bourne Identity  and  Good Will Hunting . Both decent movies, but not brilliant. Matt Damon is nowhere as annoying as his buddy Ben Affleck in movies. There's just something about Affleck that makes me want to kick him in the gonads. Maybe I was traumatized by the Voyage of the Mimi in Ms. Babbish's class.  For the Bourne Identity, I can see why they're considering a sequel. I think it has potential. This movie could have had more depth, but it does sort of have the feel of introducing a character. Good Will Hunting was good, but watching it with commercial breaks on Bravo sort of killed the flow.  I still need to see  X2 , and I want to see the  Italian Job . Maybe when the  Hulk  comes out, I'll do a theater hop with Jon or something.  Or maybe not seeing as many movies is good, because then I'll have stuff to rent during the school year... and NetFlix is cheaper than going to the actual theater. I've always been more of the rent movies than go out and watch movies person. I like the privacy and food available... actually I think that's one of my favorite date things to do... rent a movie to watch with a fine young lady. It's been a while since I've done that as a date thing, since I haven't really met anyone I dig enough to invite over for that. I'm gonna stop before I get too emo.  So I'm waiting for Naomi N. for Disneyland... I haven't been there in ages... Walt is a fascist, but hey amusement parks are amusing.  ***

I'll see if she wants to go to BJ's later tonight.  I got like a paragraph written today... it seems like I write a paragraph a day, rather than the 1 page a day!  Ozma on Thurs... alas Toni-Lynne and Diana can't go. I guess I might see other boardies there. The other Diana maybe?  I still need someone to go with me to the shows next week.  I think George leaves next week?  Haha... Lisa can't call me since I have a new cell number now.  Here's my problem. Once I have an idea in my head, I have a hard time letting go. I'm still thinking about things I should just forget about. It's better than it was before, but still... this applies to so many things floating around in my head right now. It's like... I never feel like things are adequately resolved. That was Hamlet's problem in a lot of respects in Shakespeare's play, but thank god I don't have the other wacky problems Hamlet did. 'Cause then I'd be really screwed up. I'm simply one who dwells too much...   ***

      From today's OC Register...  Jack Grisham, lead singer for the punk rock band TSOL, said his qualifications include misdemeanor drug arrests, a year of living homeless and daily struggles to pay for his family's health insurance.  "Most of us aren't riding around in Humvees with bodyguards," said Grisham, 42, of Huntington Beach.   Grisham said friends from his record label, Nitro Records, urged him to run.  "I said I wouldn't do it if it's a joke," he said. "It's not a joke to me. Being a father with a couple of kids is not a joke."  --------  We might have a battle between someone who sings about fucking the dead and the Terminator for governor!

      [14518]  My liver has been really abused this summer.  I had a dream last night where I was in a meeting and I outright pointed to you-know-who at work and ripped her a new asshole verbally. I've talked about how much I really hate her, but there's a part of me that knows we used to be extremely good friends. Part of me wants to sit down and talk things over, but there's also the fact that I know that talking won't resolve anything. I think that our personalities just simply clash. It just makes me angry and hate her when I think about how she treats people sometimes. I have to see her today at work. I wonder what she thought of my email.  Cousin Kelly is visiting tomorrow and staying until Thursday.  Hey Crystal... if by some chance you're reading this... you were talking about a show Friday?  Dunno what I'll be doing this weekend.  ***

      [14512]  Who are the 5 people who visit my blog consistently? Mike has admitted to wanting to keep an eye on me... you stalker! I know Nai and Suzanne visit from time to time, but who are the others? Laine maybe?  Oh yea... I should probably explain my counter to y'all who don't know. I've been using the same counter for years and I've accumulated a lot of hits over the past 5 years or so? It's cause I used to host a large wrestling image gallery and I had an extremely popular Winamp 2x skin. I made the first 5 star university themed skin!  Work was cool yesterday. Tania's fun to work with. She's a cool chick, it's hard to believe she's a mom. Last night Naomi, Andy, and I were talking about how it's weird to hear that people are getting married... much less have kids. I guess it's even harder to imagine when most of your friends are single. Of my friends who I consider close, Kaho and Flo (that rythmes!) are the only ones in relationships. Oh... I almost forgot Mike and Cissa. Mike would probably get on my case if I didn't list him as close friend... right Mike? Anyway... I'm not one that really feels lonely anymore, thus my contentment with singularity. I think the last time was early 2001 after the rather long relationship and series of dating. I really owe not being lonely to friends and good music... 'cause in 2001 I saw some killer shows and made some awesome friends! It did cross my mind that down the line... it'll be weird as friends start getting married off or even start to be in long term relationships recently.   Anyway... last night Naomi, Andy and I... and later Brandon hung out at Godfather's. Social D, Weezer and Bad Religion on the jukebox... that's good shit.  PPV later tonight?  ****

      Work was alright... Lisa was rather rude to me though. That made Javier laugh his ass off. I returned her attitude with a sort of evil grin.   Then I saw Tomb Raider with the girls. It was just as whatever as the first one and I fell asleep again.   Tomorrow... er... today... I have work, probably get a new cell, and probably hang out with Naomi N.  ***

      [14507]  Last night I hung out with Evan, Viet, Danny, and George at Dave and Busters. The happy hour there is awesome.  I usually don't get any sort of hang over... but the bartender used shitty vodka for my Vodka Red Bulls and I think it's why I have this groggy feeling right now.   Work today and then Tomb Raider with the girls.  I'm amused at how my Friendster testimonials make me seem cooler than I really am. Actually, I'm kind of amused at how some people envy aspects of my life. I had a friend recently tell me that she envies how I'm living it up this summer. I guess what I've been doing this summer sounds cool, but it's not exactly healthy. Drinking a lot, abusing your body in the pit, have no set sleep schedule, etc. Also people seem to be impressed by the fact I go to school in NY state, but Binghamton isn't the most exciting place. I'm definately not as smart as some think I am. I'm certainly not the pimp I appear to be. Sure I'm around cool chicks all the time, but it's all platonic. Yes I'm a bit of a pyromaniac, and I can crush cans on my skull... but I'm a pretty cautious person when I do that stuff. I have the balls to jump from high places, yet lack the testicular fortitude for very simple things.  It's like all the stories and stuff I've done have created a persona that isn't necessarily the real me. You could say I have many layers... I guess what I'm getting at is that even my closest friends don't completely know me.   ***

      Need tickets for Ozma and Casualties. H20 is playing this week at Chain Reaction... maybe... maybe... tempting...  Gonna get a new cell probably next week. I'll keep y'all posted on a potential new number. I'm gonna miss my number. 1-949-***-ALFU  Will go to Dave and Busters and drink with Evan and Danny later... and possible Viet.  I need to write more... more damn it!  **

      [17501]  The Getty seems small after you've been to NYC and European museums. I remember thinking it was huge before and being tired after a day there. It was still cool. It didn't seem like Crystal and Yumi were really into it. Oh well... it was cool nonetheless. I dug the manuscripts. I just wished I could read Latin. On the way back I made a few calls to people I knew on the way, because I didn't want to drive all the way back to Irvine in that traffic. I ended up stopping in Torrance and visiting Janet. We had Chipotle's which I think is over priced and not all that great.  I then stopped by Chain Reaction for some MTX and Audio Karate tickets.  Now here I am at home.  ***

      [17496]  About 20 hits since Sunday... you love me... you really love me...  I'd like to say that people who hurt people I care about deserve an ass kicking. This dude my friend is seeing sounds like he is trying to be a man-whore. She's never given me a good impression of him from how she describes him (I've never met him), but this really makes me annoyed. She deserves so much better.  I hope my friend is alright. I'll give her a call later this week.  I feel lazy  **

      Ok so Blogger doesn’t want to work. I’m writing this up now for later postage.  Work went by well today. I’ve noticed that since I’m the first thing Lisa sees when she comes through the door, she has a big scowl on her face until she sees Candace. No more mornings for me for a while, which means no more Café 201 for breakfast.  I actually wrote like a page today.  I went out to eat with the family… lobster, fish, fried tofu, veggies, fried bread, beef, more veggies.  I’m looking forward to going to the Getty this week. I haven’t been there in like 2 years? I went to LACMA more because of my membership… but yea… the Getty is cool. They have a big thing on Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts in addition to their cool permanent collection. Another reason it’ll be cool is I get to hang out with Crystal. She seems like a smart girl, who’s got good taste in music and likes art. She should make for some company on the little trip to the Getty.  It’ll be the movies with the Cambridge Crew aka the female posse Friday.  Tomb Raider ? I’d rather see  Bad Boys , but whatever is good.  Work on Saturday… I hope Pat doesn’t come in.  Maybe some ‘rasslin with the boys Sunday.  Been listening to the Unseen, Pistol Grip, and T(I)NC lately.  ***

      [17475]  Some random thoughts...   -Man... I fucked up a batch of dough today... eye balling ingredients when you're exhausted and hungry isn't a good idea...  -Work went by really fast today.  -I did a little bit of writing, but not enough.  -I need to return 2 books tomorrow.  -Need to pay the library a visit between noon and 5 PM  -People who dig art are cool, especially if they know their shit. Some people like art, because of the cultural capital of liking art. But, you should like things because you actually like it and not because it makes you look smart. So when I meet someone who knows their shit, I'm impressed. That's not saying I'm an expert on anything though.  -I dwell and worry about things I shouldn't... it's my obssessive compulsive side.  -Stephanie still owes me $13.  - I should be less lazy.  -The Dropkick Murphy's  Blackout  is a great album. I've been listening to it a lot lately. "Bastards of Parade" is perhaps my favorite song right now.  -Binghamton, NY seems like a distant memory.  -I want to see another show.  ***

      I called like 4 people wanting to go to BJ's for some good beer and pizza, but no one was picking up. Thank god George had a spare ticket to Rise Against.  All I can say is that shows at Chain Reaction during summer never disappoint. There's something about a hot sweaty venue and crowd that makes for a crazy sort of energy. I'm actually not a big fan of hardcore, but the energy was amazing. I only know a few Rise Against songs, but it was enough to keep me going for the fucking intense 30 minutes set in 100+ degree heat in there. I was drenched when I walked out of the place.  I'm fucking hungry... time to regain the weight I sweated off earlier.  ****

      [17470]  Work went by faster today. I managed to swap my shifts with Tania, so that means tomorrow and Tuesday... I get to sleep in. Coolness!  Lisa kind of offended me today. She flat out said she's hesitant from letting Tania and I swap, because she doesn't trust me working with George. That's a load of crap. She should fucking know that I'm a pretty good worker and that's just lame thinking that I can't work with a friend. I think she said that because of the personal history between the three of us, but then again that makes her a hypocrite. It makes her a hypocrite since she used to work with us as schedulers and we were all friends. We had fun and got our work done. It's also stupid because I get along with everyone in the office. I get along with everyone except her. It's not my fault everyone likes me and no one likes her.  Alas Crystal had to work today. Alas Evan made plans. Maybe I'll try calling up another friend. I wanna make use of being able to sleep in. Maybe I'll call up Naomi.  ***

      [17466]  Tired... so tired... tired of working at 8 AM. Afterwork I hung out with Minh-An and her boyfriend at the Block. It was cool. I don't get to see my buddy as much as I'd like. We've known each other for a few years, yet we only see one another like every few months. I think she's one of my few friends that aren't single. It seems like this summer there are a few folks that are taken. As opposed to last year, when pretty much everyone was single. Yet this summer has been much more wild.  After hanging out for a while, I paid Jim's Music a visit to inquire about music lessons and here I am now at home feeling tired.  Lots of stuff in the news about the CIA and the Bush Administration. I'd just like the point out every country has a weapons program of some sort. However, the Bush Adminstration made it seem like Iraq actually had weapons or the potential to create so-called weapons of mass destruction. Bush's speeches were used to create fear and correspondingly create support for a war that could have been avoided. The pre-war diplomacy was a sham. I remember someone asking me last September if I thought we were going to war, and I said of course. Bush's speeches were as bogus as the "I did not have sexual relations" speech that Clinton made.  **

      [17462]  I'm exhausted. Indeed I fucking am. I don't know how I'm gonna do this 8 AM work thing until next Tuesday, with only Sunday off. To think I had zero period in high school. 7 AM every morning!  I went to sleep around 2 AM and woke up around 7 AM... went to McDonald's before work to pick up a Sausage Egg McMuffin since I was starving (staying up does that to you). I made it through another 6 hr shift... it was exhausting. Now I'm here online, feeling kind of out it from having a bunch of coffee and donuts at work. Yes I know I promised to be healthy...  According to my counter... people actually read this thing. Or I left my counter on the wrestling picture archive on Geocities and 200+ have hit it within the past 12-ish hours.  Who the hell is reading this bessides Mike? Post on my guestbook if you read this thing or IM me.   Oh yea... and I didn't get any writing done yesterday. I really need to fucking get shit done today.  **

      [17456]  M.C. Escher said, "We adore chaos because we love to produce order."  I think that quote fits myself and a very dear friend of mine. Interestingly, I put that up on  urlLink xanga  before I talked to this friend of mine. I made the mistake once of opening my mouth when I didn't really understand what she was saying, but this time around I felt like I really could relate to a lot of things she was saying. What is it about adoring chaos and loving order that we both deal with? Is it the modernist mentality of insatiable desire? Equilibrium is not enough for us?  Brave New World  and the movie  Equilibrium  are two artistic examples of that desire for chaos. Emotions perhaps exemplify chaos more than anything. It's always so complicated and constantly changing... for some more than others. Yet taking away that chaos, as argued in those two works, takes away our humanity. However, as a civilization, there is the opposing force of order that is needed for the maintenance of society. Freud goes into this in his psychoanalysis and in  Civilization and its Discontents .   So when it comes to human relationships what do we want? Chaos or order? Is being content enough?  If this friend happens to read this... I just want her to know that however she choses to navigate these two opposing forces, I'll be there for her.  ***

      Work was really show today... at least no administative folks were around. It was pretty kick back... but it was really slow. I made a couple of business and pleasure calls as a result. Business as in getting shit ready for Vegas.   It's almost 1:30 AM and I've gotta pick up the rental car at 8:30 AM... woohoo... running my body into the fucking ground still. My body is really gonna love the 100 degree temperatures in Vegas combined with booze.   Anway... back to work... it had its moments since Julia stopped by before she takes off for training in Florida. It's cool working with Tania again also. They're funny girls. Of course they're usually laughing at my demented sense of humor. Yep... demented. I mean I joke about old people dying, marrying corpses, and the boss working on his "pipeline" report in the back restroom. I'm gonna make a fine professor one of these days.  Viva Las Vegas!  ***

      Bush said AIDS / HIV is "the deadliest enemy Africa has ever faced." Does he realize if Africa wasn't made Europe and America's bitch for the past 300 years, the disease wouldn't nearly be as wide spread? That's why Liberia is fucked up right now.  US troops are going to be in Iraq for up to 4 years... how about US troops will be in Iraq as long as the US is a superpower?

       Pirates of the Caribbean  had undead pirates, a secret island, a governor's daughter and a monkey. Hey... that sounds like  Secret of Monkey Island ! Geoffrey Rush aka Barbossa as LeChuck the undead pirate captain? Keira Knightley aka Elizabeth as Elaine Marley the governor's daughter? Orlando Bloom as Guybrush? Hmm well I dunno about that. Orlando Bloom was less homo in this movie than when he played a pixie elf, until he got the musketeer outfit out. Muskeeters are 15th century and this movie is taking place in probably the early 18th century. Hey there was monkey and it was on an island!  Dig pirates? I recommend the book  The Many Headed Hydra  by Rediker and Linebaugh.  Books? Books!? Shit I have some reading and shit to do. I got some editting done today though.  Oh yea... before the movie. Janet, Julia, Naomi R. and I had some spinach alfredo and mushroom pizza with some ribs. I don't think that pan worked too well for baking pizza. I think thin sheet metal pans works the best. The basil was a nice touch to the crust though.  Work tomorrow, and then Vegas this weekend.  ***

I've been listening to some old school punk (Adolescents, Dead Kennedys, etc.),  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes , and  Dropkick Murphys .  I had a dream about Ultima 8. Yes I'm that much of a computer nerd... or at least I used to be.  I have work from 3-9 PM... and I need to go grocery shopping for tomorrow.  Not sure why, but whenever I chat with Laine these days... it's been fun making fun of her.  ***

      I made another pizza today... I keep getting better and better at the whole crust making thing. I want to branch out into new variations and make the perfect crust.  I did a little bit of paper work, but not as much as I should.   I was thinking... one of my biggest flaws is that I hang on to things and dwell on things longer than I should. I have a personality in which I have pick it apart from every angle. See all the possibilities and re-live the events thinking "what if?" It's completely opposite from what that girl told me she thought of me a few weeks ago. She said I seem like the type who doesn't give a fuck. I guess you could say I'm always bouncing from the different side of my personality. I'm pretty schizophrenic. I mean... with the way I've been running myself into the ground this summer... and not to mention doing and saying stupid shit... yea it seems like I don't give a fuck. Yet I'm very aware of the consequences of what I'm doing. I know what I'm doing is detrimental to my health, wallet, grades, social relationships, etc. I also think about those consequences a lot... way more than I should actually.   I forsee another pizza in my near future. Oh and for you vegetarian friends that read this. I always make veggie pizzas. Aren't ya proud of me?  ***

      The Vandals show was pretty fucking awesome. You know it's a good show when you come home drenched in sweat, bruised and battered... thirsty for beer. The crowd was one of the best crowds I've seen in a while. You had people moshing to the opening band, the God Awfuls, and people going the whole night. They played a variety of stuff from really new to somewhat older. I don't think they ever play really old stuff anymore, but they were playing stuff from the mid-90s which is good. Does Warren always have to show his ass? They closed with "I Have A Date."  ****

      I just realized that I like living alone, because it gives me time to be anti-social. Living at home has been annoying, because there's some around to talk to you. And they talk to you, when you want to be just left alone. I don't really need someone to tell me what's in the fridge, or what they did, or whatever... when I'm home, I want to be left alone.  ***

      I celebrated the 4th of July yesterday by watching GI Joe on DVD and having a BBQ.  It was cool. I had high school and UCI friends there. Maybe 13 people showed up? We drank a lot of beer and ate a lot of meat. Then we sat around smoking flavored tobacco mixed with a little weed. After that me and the posse went to watching T3.  T3 was cool, more enjoyable than fireworks. It's not as good as the first 2 in so many ways; however, it went by really fast. Before I knew it the 2 hours were up. Arnold was hilarious in some parts, but I don't think he had the intensity that he had in the first 2. Also the lack of Linda Hamilton hurt the movie. I think the cameo by the psychiatrist was a nice touch though.  So Bush made a speech yesterday about how the United States is an important part in shaping the world. As a superpower, yes it is true that the U.S. does affect a lot of what goes on. However, when he says things like, "Without America's active involvement in the world, the ambitions of tyrants would go unopposed and millions would live at the mercy of terrorists." That's a further slap in the face to all the people we've run over in order to maintain our dominance.  I have to admit that we did a good job in places like Japan following WWII, but through out most of the Cold War... we didn't bring peace and democracy to most of the places we sent soldiers. We left the countries ravaged and in chaos.   Anyway... gonna see the Vandals tonight. Should be fun  ***

      I was pretty tired after work, especially after finishing of my left over Chinese food. Then I lounged around with a smoothie watching TV half awake. Steff dropped by and picked up her CD. She didn't mind too much that the band mispelled her name. Then I lounged around some more, slept for a few hours. Jon then came over to watch some Smackdown. Then we went to the bloody Albertsons for BBQ stuff.  I've got a good amount of people coming tomorrow. It should be cool. I plan on sleeping in and then doing some setting up and getting ice.  ***

      Have you ever noticed that things you want to and should forget are usually the hardest things to forget. It's like you act like it was nothing and act like you moved on... but somethings are just impossible to get over. This applies to more than one thing that's going on right now. It's like you act like you always did, but after you act... you wonder if actions could be misconstrued.   It's hot.  **

      I've been having weird / intense dreams as of late. Last night I had a dream where a friend coerced me to vandalized a banquet that was set up on the field by Santiago Hills. There were candles set up on the tables and I basically knocked shit over and set things ablaze. Only for the police to come after me. I tried to hide in the bushes, but they found me. Violent dreams like this usually result in me waking up sweating and hardly able to move. It's like my body was physically responding to what was going on in my mind.   Yesterday was a long day of work, then a 2 hour drive to LA for the free AM Radio in store show. I could have really used someone for carpool usage. It was pretty cool. They're significantly better than they were like 1.5 - 2 years ago when I saw them. It was cool meeting Toni-Lynne and Diana also. That brings my boardie meeting count to 4.... I feel like such a nerd for saying that. But it's not like I have no real life connections to these folks as Janet knows Toni-Lynne. We hung out at Jack In The Box... a cool one with bullet proof glass protecting the people inside and then we tried to go to the after party on Vine. I gave up trying to find parking after a bit of driving around. Have I ever mentioned hating parking in Hollywood?   Man I got made fun of in my quest to bring goodies back for Steff. This girl made fun of my for not wearing the free buttons I got for Steff and because the drummer made his autograph out to Stephani (not a typo)... as the CD got passed to the rest of the band, they kept joking around that my name is Stephani. I wonder if I should fill in the missing e for the band? Hah... she'd never know. Well now that there's a record here, maybe I shouldn't.  Work today at 4. I should do some writing prior to work though.  ***

      I'm so not a morning person. Having work in the morning really drains my energy reserves. I'm writing this from work, cause no one is picking up the phone... pick up the phone baby... addicts of communication, addicts of communication... mmm... just had to bust out some  Randy  there. I'm gonna be going to the free AM Radio mini-show / CD signing later. AM Radio is alright, but overrated in my opinion. But free music, especially free live music is always a good thing. I need to pick up some goodies for Steff, and I want to meet up with some boardies. I'm not sure if I was amused or not when Steff said "no alcohol tonight" when she thought she could go.  Woohoo BBQ on Friday and Vandals on Saturday. It should be another fun filled week.  ***

      Last night Steff said something really random. As she was giving me a goodbye hug, she said "it's been surreal." It was random, but I think those words sum up my summer quite well.  In 3 months I've seen 11 concerts. This summer I've seen Bad Religion, Alkaline Trio, One Man Army, the Vandals, AM Radio, the Circle Jerks, the Dropkick Murphys, Ozma, MTX, Phantom Planet, the Moving Units, the Muffs, Audio Karate, Rilo Kiley, and Rise Against.  There's been a lot of booze, fire, vomit, and blood - - in Vegas, the storage shed, Shooters, parties, etc. Last night we did some crazy shit with Descendent River at the shed.  This summer hasn't been without drama. That's something I won't revisit right now, but it certainly made things interesting the past 3 months.  My flight is at 10 PM... I'll be leaving for LAX probably in 3 hrs.  For all my peeps in Irvine / OC / LA / SD - - It's been a great summer. I'll miss you all.   Binghamton: Year 2 here I come.  ***

      Hmm... everytime I do karaoke at Shooters I bleed. I accidently punched the ceiling when I crawled onto a railing while singing Weezer's "Dope Nose." I did renditions of Modern English's "Melt with you" and the Offsprings "Pretty Fly for a (Asian) guy." Last time I smashed the mic against my head during the Eurythmics' "Sweet Dreams" and opened up my forehead.  I have about 5.5 pages left to write and I'm mostly done with the editting.  Tomorrow I need to return some books and get writing done.  Also going to Dave and Busters tomorrow night.  Tonight was fucking fun.   ***

      The street fair was 4-5 times more crowded today. This made us 2 hrs late from meeting up with Hayden. Poor guy was waiting alone for us.  It was cool though. We saw Rilo Kiley, The Moving Units, Phantom Planet, the former ladies of the Supremes, and heard Isaac Hayes as we walked away. I got to hang out with or talk to Toni-Lynne, Diana, Steff, Andy, Derek, Hayden, and Esther today.   I'm really tired. Lots of walking and driving today.  Los Angeles is cool though. I'm gonna miss it when I leave Wednesday night.  ****

      I've noticed that when I go to sleep really tired, I tend to wake up earlier that I normally would. Perhaps sleeping more efficiently?  When I woke up this morning I sort of realized something. Summer's almost over and I did almost everything I wanted to do. I think the only thing is that there are certain people I wish I hung out with more than I actually did.  I've been told that I'm pretty good a keeping in touch with people. I suppose I am, but there are certain people which I think fall through the cracks. This could be in large part due to the person on the other end not wanting to keep in touch. That's cool if they don't want to, but sometimes I wonder if it's cause they read my intentions wrong?  I still have about 7 pages... 5 if I make it 12.5 font... to do. I don't feel motivated.  Indie bands playing today... I wonder if there will be as many punks, midgets, goths, pregant chicks wearing bikinis, guys with roses attached to their nipples, etc.  **  **

      I just got back from the Sunset Junction Street fair. It was really cool. For $7 I got to see a bunch of random bands, the Muffs, and the Circle Jerks. It also had some interesting booths and interesting people. Anyway... the Muffs weren't that great, or perhaps it was 'cause their audio equipment sucked ass? The Circle Jerks were awesome. The crowd was lively and Keith Morris was fun. We also saw Greg Hetson walking around the fair earlier.  It was cool hanging out with Brandon, PM, Heather, and PM's friend. Tomorrow it should be interesting. Lots of people I know will be there tomorrow, including PM, Esther, Steff, Abby, and a bunch of boardies.   Today was a good day.  ***

      [14666]  Yesterday was a good day. I had lunch with Marc at the Arriba Grill at the University Plaza. I'd never eaten there before. I remember when that place was built freshman year of college.  Then I spent the afternoon at the Norton Simon museum with Naomi R. That's a cool museum. It's free admission AND parking, plus you get a free print of a work of art! I managed to make it home from Pasadena in 1.5 hrs during rush hour, which was really cool. I was expecting 2 hrs.  Then it was watching Smackdown with Derek and Jon.  Today I wrote like half a paragraph so far.  I feels like a Saturday.  Nai's going away dinner tonight.  It's so sad... the female posse aka the Cambridge crew is scattered all over now. Flo in Texas, Nai in Maryland, Julia in San Diego, Janet in Torrance, and Steff in Irvine.  The other Naomi is in Israel, Kaho is up in the bay area, Andy is down in San Diego, and Derek might be going to Utah.  I go back to Binghamton in 5 days.  ***

      [14653]  Last night I hung out with Naomi, Mag, Frank and Heather. We got approached by cops while drinking in the park. At least we didn't get ticketed.  I think I have 4 circles of friends... well in Irvine anyway...  The Posse: Andy, Derek, Kaho, Jon and Brandon The Cambridge Girls: Steff, Naomi R., Janet, Julia, and Flo The other Irvine High people: Basically Naomi N. and her friends Shadowfaxians: People from the freshman dorms  In Binghamton, I pretty much hang out with the dudes from my incoming class of grad students: Jeff, Chi-Wei, and Wataru.  So I was talking about clothing in my last post... I should probably get new shoes before I leave for school. My current shoes are a bit worn out... too many shows. Ok... my compaint about shoes is that they should really make laces custom length to the shoe. 'Cause they issue the same length laces for small sizes as they for hige sizes. It bugs me when the tips of laces get obliterated, because you never know when you have to relace your shoes.  Something else about clothing is that there was a thread on ATNW that was anti-cargo pants. What I think is funny about that is because many of the people on that board are indie / emo type kids. That means that vintage clothes are more their style. I really have no issue with how people dress except for the following:   1) Slutty / skanky / too revealing - I like seeing tits, but seriously... the only place where that's cool is at the beach and maybe a club. How do expect guys not stare?  2) Wearing heavy leather, suits, ties, etc. at some punk shows - It's fine if you're gonna stand in the back with your beer and watch, but if you're planning to be in the thick of things dress knowing that you need mobility and lighter clothes. It gets fucking hot in there, and you should know better. That way you don't have to be a wiener and escape the heat.   Back to the thread... It was just silly because they didn't like cargos, because that's not the in fashion bottomwear for their subculture and they're really popular right now. It's just elitism at work. Personally cargos are extremely handy for someone like me who carries a fat wallet full of copy cards, a cell phone, keys, and scraps of paper with stuff written on them. Utility is important.  Been listening to  Social Distortion  and  Weezer  today.  I need to get shit done today.  ***

      Ok... I got half way through proof-reading my 690F paper.  I have 13 pages left of 602 with 12 days more to go. It's do-able...   Listening to  Bouncing Souls  right now... good stuff...  I'm feeling restless... I wanna get out of the house.  So I keep seeing articles about metrosexuals... basically straight guys that seem gay. I think that's the most absurd term and idea I've ever heard of. Basically what it is, is dudes getting trendy and more self absorbed. This will undoubtedly fuel the cosmetic and fashion industries with men buying more useless stuff.  Look I do things like cook and I think I cook pretty damn well. I can slice and dice, bake, sautee, and grill and I dig chicks. I can sew and boobs turn me on. I know I have taste and style when it comes to home furnishings, but it has more to do with my artistic training than my sexuality.   Whether you like dudes or chicks has nothing to do with your abilities and tastes. Subculture and natural talents affect that stuff. Gay dudes are expected to dress nice, that's why they do. Girls are expected waste hundreds of dollars a month on useless crap, so they do. Not all of them make the best decisions though.   I suppose I could dress "nicer," but fuck that... I have no desire to spend $20 for shirts and $50 for pants / shorts. I don't need accessories outside of a watch for telling time, and an occassional hat when I have hair and don't feel like combing. My only vice is really fine dining... good food and its presentation is the only thing that I have a weakness for, but food is a neccessity in life... cologne is not.  **

      I returned a book at UCI yesterday, and visited Marc in his office yesterday. I managed to get some writing done too.  Then it was Smackdown with the guys.  I need to be more productive! 12 days left in CA!  Probably gonna do something today as a send off for Naomi N.  Naomi R. is leaving for Europe end of next week I think... so that means the girls and I will probably do something. I need to go out for a beer with Alex also.  Naomi N. commented on how I have a lot of friends and I do a pretty good job of keeping in touch with 'em all. I guess I do... that's probably why I've been out drinking every night this week! Or chatting online instead of writing.  The upcoming school year should be good in that lots of people will be visiting. Andy will be visitin in Sept. I'll probably head down to visit Nai, Cissa, and Mike in Oct. then Janet and Julia will be visiting in March. Possibly Steff in November.  I've been listening to  Circle Jerks  and  Pistol Grip  lately.   ***

      [14633]  My posts have been short as of late, because... well... I'm lazy. I haven't gotten any writing done in the past few days. I've literally only been... eating, sleeping surfing the web, and drinking.  Last night was cool. Derek, Jon, Heather, and I went to Shooters for the free food. It wasn't bad considering it was free. Wings, fries, nuggets, chips, taquitos, salads, etc. What was really interesting was the biker meeting that was going on in there. We were a bit confused by all the Harleys that were parked out side and the dude playing with the mic. At least I can say I've been to a biker meeting now. Afterwards, we watched some TV at my place. We caught the second episode of  The OC . Alas I have no TV at school... I can't watch it there... but would it make me homesick?  I've been listening to the  Circle Jerks  as of late. I'm looking forward to seeing them in a few weeks.  I think I'll go shower, make myself some breakfast, do some writing, and at some point go to UCI to return a book or 2.  ***

      [14603]   First something a little more serious... my thoughts on the California Governor Recall. I guess the question is that if this is really democracy in action. In many ways I feel that it is democracy in action in that an unpopular governor in a state faced with serious financial problems may be removed from office. However, a fundamental problem with democracy is the mass media. Gray Davis's downfall has a lot to do with his poor playing of public relations and political forces taking advantage of that misplay. I remember an article in the LA Times early in his term discussing how he's laying so low that some people don't even know who he is. This allowed Republicans such as Issa to use the media machine against him. Then all of sudden people were talking about how bad Davis is. Arnold Scharzenegger on the other hand is playing the media to his advantage. Leaking news he might not run and then announcing his entry into the race on a talk show.   Here's my awkwardness with the whole thing. I am a fan of referendum and popular vote and I feel that many canidates (130 as of today) will make this election interesting. The media surrounding the whole thing could boost voter turn out. I mean with Arnold, Gary Coleman, Jack Grisham, Larry Flynt, etc. people will want to vote, because this time around it's kind of fun. However, the problem is that people can be sheep. That's why our country was made a republic and not a democracy. That's why referendums are rare in our country, unlike others. Our so-called founding fathers were for the most part fearful of the  demos  and people, yet they felt that sovereignty can only be based on common will. There's the tension right there. Will the people make the right choice? I'm not saying that what is right is what I believe in, but think about mobs. In mob sitatuations innocent people get hurt. Yet media coverage of things such as police violence (Rodney King, Rampart) created a positive uproar from the  demos .   I think this election is making people aware of what's going in the state, which is a good thing. Once people are aware, not even name power is enough. Let's hope people wake up and think about what they're doing and not get caught up in the media.  Ok to something less serious...  Mr. T Experience  rocks live. They played a great set and all 25 fans seemed to dig it. I thought Stay at Home Bomb was hilarious. Tossing twinkies at the audience and screaming "you're fat" is just great satire.  ***

      [14595]  Ok I met up with Diana at Chain Reaction and managed to catch the last song or 2 of the River City Rebels. They, like the other bands playing last night, I had heard of, but never seen. They were actually pretty good. They had trombone and sax, but it was really ska. It was pretty punk and they had a lot of energy, which was good. Madcap was pretty whatever. I wasn't really impressed. Audio Karate put on a good show. Lots of energy from the crowd and some new songs were debuted.  I'm much more excited about MTX than the show last night.  They're a band I've been listening to for a while and wanted to see the last few times they passed through, but I couldn't make it.  ***

      So I see little high school kids online debating about what is punk all the time. Labels are so high school. I don't really buy the whole punk is a lifestyle bit. It as a genre of music is hard enough to pin down. For example, the big 3 consisting of the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Clash. They sound nothing a like and are considered punk. Buzzcocks, Cock Sparrer, Stiff Little Fingers, and the Damned all sound different. The LA scene had goth and surf tossed into the mix. X, Agent Orange, Adolescents, TSOL, and Bad Religion. Social D had a touch of country. There was also the whole new wave thing. Basically everything in the real world is a spectrum. When you look at a color wheel, when does green become yellow or blue? It's a gradient. Yet it's nice to know what something is. That's why we have labels.   Last night I met up with George and Samantha at Dave and Buster's and caught up on stuff. It was fun. I hadn't seen Samantha in over a year so it was cool to see how she's doing. Too bad Julia couldn't make it. She was busy with her training down in SD.   Audio Karate show tonight with Diana. Live music is always good, but I have to take it easy. I'm still post concussion.  ***

      [14584]  It's so nice that I have people who care enough about me to get angry when I do things that aren't healthy or safe. I mentioned Steff in an earlier post being critical and me thinking that it's cool to have friends like that. Well... just now Flo gave me a hard time about the whole moonsault at the Ozma show. That's really cool. It's really nice to know people care. Sure I'm still gonna do crazy shit... but it's nice to have criticism.  The conversation was kind of deja vu, because I remember freshman year of college... I was doing stuff like jumping off a drinking fountain onto a bunch of mats at Crawford Hall. I remember being kind of annoyed that Sue told me not to do stuff like that, but I guess I was less mature back then. She was amongst the many old dorm folks at PM's birthday on Sunday.  So I had lunch with the girls at Baja Fresh... I haven't eaten there in years and after today... I remember why... it's really expensive. It was cool though. It's always fun. Then we went to Gelsons and messed around with the wine cooler machine.  After all that... Janet, Julia, and I went to tour Steff's office. I met a dude there that was on the SF State Wrestling Team when Andrew Pena wrestled on there. Yea... the Irvine connections never cease... but yea... we were both silent for a second when I asked if he knew Andrew. Pretty damn sad. Since I'm on the topic, Pena was an amazing guy and it's fitting that he's immortalized at IHS in a tournament and award.  After the tour, Janet, Julia and I hung out at my place and looked through my old pictures. More Irvine memories.  Irvine... as I explained to Steff on Sunday... will always be home. Yes I look forward to getting away again and going back to school, but I have so many memories here in  The OC ... heh....  I can't forget my friends and adventures I've had. All the school stuff, roaming the streets of OC, Walmart, malls, HomeTown Buffet, Chain Reaction, etc. It was funny going through my old yearbooks with the girls... I've come across so many interesting characters in my time here. I hope I'm as memorable as those people are for me.  ***

      [14579]   I watched  The OC  last night. It wasn't bad, but not great either. I cracked up when they dissed Chino which is in the 909. Are LA people the only ones that talk about area codes like this?   I still feel weird about not wanting to work at Nielsen anymore... the part of me that hates being a quitter hates this... but I can't work with Lisa or Thelma anymore. Lisa's not the type that will ever leave me alone while I work there. Thelma just really upsets me for not coming to talk to me and trying to work against me.  I'm having lunch with the girls later and I'm meeting up with George and Julia later for drinks.  **

      [14565]   What happened between Lisa and I in the past really changed me. It's affected how I deal with people in so many ways....   Last night she said she was really hurt, because she knew that I knew how much those words would hurt her. I told her I really wish that things happened differently, but I know if I was faced with reliving the same situation... I would have done the same or said worse. I don't know if she understands how betrayed I felt when she said that I'd be a better friend if I believed in God and that she tried to change me. I also knew that no matter what I did would hurt her. If I had just chosen to stop being her friend, or confronted her about it... she would have been hurt regardless. I felt that those were words she had to hear, with my honest feelings. Even on the phone last night all my words were on the defensive. I've never been able to... maybe because I know her too well... to just say what I want to say to her. It's cause I know she always takes my words the wrong way. I couldn't say that while I have regrets... that being in the office with her reminded me of all the reason why I said what I said.  She's someone who has to have it her way and be in charge of every detail.... She forgets sometimes that she's dealing with human beings. I remember all the comments her group were making about her when I helped her on a project. She's bossy.  At Nielsen she's been very disorganized. She kept jumping back and forth what my role with LPM was. She kept calling me with changes in the work schedule.  She kept treating me like I wasn't doing any work. It was a slap in the face when she said she didn't trust me working with George.  When I suggested that an email letting FRs and MRs know that calling the office cell before closing is better than calling the land line... she made a demeaning remark.  She gave me attitude that was unprovoked.  She's going around telling people that if it's in her power I won't be back for future hollidays.  I called the office today and told them I couldn't go in anymore. I gave them a partial truth. I did have a virus and I do have a lot of writing to get done. I just didn't feel it necessary to cite all the reasons why I simply can't work there anymore. I don't believe for a second that me being a target was without personal reasons. This is someone who wanted to toss a 14 year old girl out of her confirmation class. She's someone who takes everything personally and since it's not humanly possible to be perfect... there will always be ammo for her to use against me. That and I feel stabbed in the back by a co-worker for instigating things made me not even want to go into the office anymore.   So at least now I can work on my papers and have fun.  *

      I've been in such a weird mood the past few days... I think that hit to the head jarred something.  How do I describe it? It's kind of like the   Pixies  song "Where is My Mind"  "With your feet in the air and your head on the ground Try this trick and spin it, yeah Your head will collapse But there's nothing in it  And you'll ask yourself Where is my mind?"  **

      I went to Michaels and bought some watercolor stuff and met up with Steff to return her cell.  I just got home from dinner and a comedy show for PM's birthday. It was good to hang out with the Shadowfaxians again. Some of those folks I only see like once a year.  It was a pretty good and relaxing day. I think the only sour notes were first I'm nervous about trying to make amends with someone tomorrow and second having to defend a friend from another friend. Let's just say I know this friend has a lot of negative shit going on and there's some jealousy and bitterness about some stuff, but for her to say this other friend doesn't care is so not true. It annoyed me that I had to stand up for the other friend and tell this friend that she doesn't know how hard things are for her. It annoyed me, because she knows I'm friends with this other person. Likewise, this other person has said stuff about the friend that I didn't like hearing.  ***

      Yesterday was a long day. I had work, which went by somewhat fast. I found out that things between Lisa and I have degraded even more. All yesterday... I felt a combination of confusion, guilt, hate, anger, and sadness. It's a realization that things have gotten to a level where we really have serious problems with each other and I'm tempted to just quit. I feel sad, because we used to be such close friends. It's just that so much I can't forgive her for. I know I hurt her really bad, but I was hurt too. I don't know if she knows how betrayed I felt at her hypocrisy in so many ways. I wish things didn't have to happen the way it did, but I know if I was in the same position I was back then... I would probably do the same. I feel like I should probably talk to her... I know things have been blown out of proportion.  After work I met up with some of the girls and went to see Janet in her new place. Then we had dinner at Claim Jumper. That was the first time I've ever finished a meal at Claim Jumper. Then again I guess chicken is light meat. Later met Steff's new boyfriend. We were going to watch a movie, but ended up bowling instead. I was sort of sucking it at the begining, but then I started improving. I was doing a lot better in the second game.  On the drive back I said that I was probably gonna go hang out with someone who I know that maybe I shouldn't. Steff kind of yelled out a critical "Why!?" I've noticed that Steff is probably the only friend that, when commenting or offering advice... tells me things I don't necessarily want to hear. I think that's important. That's not to say that other friends' advice isn't valuable, but I think it's good that I have a friend that really gives it to me like it is.  I think I went to sleep rather late... around 2? That means I was up from 8 AM to 2 AM yesterday / today and I woke up around 11 AM.   I had weird dreams last night about battling aliens. I was hunting them at night and taking their weapons and then selling them in a seedy bar... all RPG style. The other one was being in an amusement park type place and having lunch with the kids from Spy Kids.  My head hurts... I really think I got a concussion.  It's PM's birthday today... need to get him something before 6 PM.  ***

      "I'm waiting for some kind of sign I try to separate, try to separate my body from my mind. Cold feelings in the night You know, this feeling just ain't right. And though I try I just can't hide Cold feelings in the night"  Mmm....  Social Distortion ... It's 8 AM... and Mike Ness is already making me want to drink.

      [14543]   Work later today... maybe pay Michaels or Fry's a visit.  Call some people to see if there's anything exciting going on.  Tomorrow is work and go have dinner with the girls.  Sunday is PM's birthday and dinner with Shadowfax people.  So I got a marker and drew SUFFER on my arm / shoulder in the font of Bad Religion's  Suffer  album. It actually looks kind of cool. I think pay a place a visit Monday to see how much it'd be to get that done. Why "suffer" you might ask. Well there are several real reasons. Two are that the name Sufferboy has stuck with me since high school, and Bad Religion is my favorite band. Also I think the word itself has deep meaning for myself personally and philosophically. The existence of suffering is a component of so many of the world's religions. I think suffering is what reminds us of our mortality and correspondingly our humanity. Where as it is joy that gives us a taste of the divine. It's like... when you feel pain... time exists for you. You count the seconds, minutes, hours, etc. But when you're happy... time doesn't matter to you. Days, months, etc... go by as if you were a immortal and those measures of time go by without you noticing.  I think a tattoo this summer is appropriate because... well... despite all the things I've done... I haven't been happy. I know I'm sounding emo right now... but it's been a long time since I was really happy. I remember last summer Jenny was making fun of me for never being happy or knowing joy. I guess I know being content, but happiness?  **

      Yesterday I took Kelly sightseeing in LA / Hollywood.  First we went to LACMA... it's been roughly a year since I was last there. Last time was with the girls plus Cissa. It was cool and relaxing. My camera on my phone takes pictures somewhat well in there... heh.  After that I took Kelly up to Hollywood Blvd and we walked around over there. It was cool. It's been a while since I was last there. So Mako, David Carradie and David Hasselhoff have stars on the walk of fame? Afterwards, we got something to eat on Santa Monica Blvd down the street from the Troubadour.   The restaurant we went to was a Mexican place with a large gay clientele. It was funny cause our waiter, who was very friendly, looked like Matt Damon. I don't think I'm gonna watch Matt Damon movies the same way again. Also... he cracked a joke about the boneless versus regular buffalo wings. He's all like the boneless ones are delicious and easier to eat... unless you like bone. Haha...   The weird part was the men's room where there was... a cross dresser? It was a small restroom and s/he was it's alright to come in and pee... I'm just washing my hands. Uh... that was weird. I'm all like... it's alright... I'll wait.  Then it was the Ozma / Piebald show. It was a good show, we caught an opening band who's name I didn't catch. They were your typical indie rock band, but it was good. Piebald was next. I'd seen them on bills at place like Chain Reaction for a while now. They aren't bad. I really dug Ozma's set. They played old and new stuff. Well some of the new stuff wasn't really new as it's stuff that they've been playing for years, but finally put on an album. I did things like yell out "Hey Friendster" at the show. It was funny, cause the girls next to me was all like... hey we're on Friendster too. Here's the crazy part.... I did a moonsault during... shit... I don't remember what song... but it was a picture perfect moonsault. I crowd surfed onto the stage and was between Brummel and Slegr... facing the drummer. I clapped my hands ala the Japanese wrestlers and hit it. Next thing I knew I was on the floor on my back with my legs facing away from the band... ok... now that I look back I had to have been caught and then dropped.... resulting in my body position.  Anyway it was a long day but good day.  ****

      I have a theory it's called the men's room quality of life index for universities. Design and up keep are correlated with how much the adminstration cares about its students. Binghamton does no rank too well, while UCI is pretty good.  I recall UCLA being decent from what I've seen, and UCSD is pretty good.   **

      Dude... Hegel... hell those Germans... a freaking pain in the ass to read. So as far as I can tell.. the Spirit is objectivity and it opposes Conciousness. Self-Conciousness is somewhere in the middle? Marx is better, but still not fun.  Elena's theory on that is that Germany isn't nearly as nice as France and Italy where philsophers sit around in the Riviera with wine or coffee. So in their bitterness they write difficult stuff, unlike their smooth and eloquent counterparts to the south. Umberto Eco and Italo Calvino were good.  I'm tired...  **

      I just saw  Punch Drunk Love . It was pretty cheaply made, but a pretty good movie. The movie added a touch of roughness to Adam Sandler's normally dopey characters. It should have been more violent though. That's just me though. I'm someone with a lot of pent of rage and likes violence.  I've done jack shit today. I've only read like 10 pages of Calvino. I did manage to make pizza dough, do laundry, and do some cleaning.  I feel a lot better now. Bessides a tiny bit of phlegm build up.  **

      [14819]  I'm sitting here eating my usual breakfast of scrambled eggs and potatoes and drinking apple cinamon tea, while listening to  Weezer . The tea was a bit too hot and just singed my tongue. So maybe not drinking the tea right at this moment.  Last night I managed to get through about 50 pages of Italo Calvino's  Invisible Cities . That not saying much, because of the way the book is paginated it's more like reading 25 pages. I have another 100 pages to go. It's a weird book as Martin said, but extremely cool. The translation from Italian is still very eloquent and pretty deep in its philosophical content. I'm just not sure how it fits into the course.  I still need to read Hegel and Eco. That's my plan. To get the readings for those 2 classes done today. Will I do it? We'll see.  I have  Punch Drunk Love  sitting around, that I'll probably watch today.  ***

      [14814]  I believe Geminis are supposed to be air signs, maybe that's why I've always enjoyed windy days. I remember elementary school at Santiago Hills and really enjoying being out in the field on a windy day. The wind would always be coming from the eucalyptis trees (which were originally planted by the Irvine Ranch as wind breakers). It was always a lot of fun walking toward the trees and feeling the air around surround me.  Today I was sitting on a bench waiting for the bus and it felt nice feeling the air.  I managed to pick up a big stack of books today from the library. I need to get a bunch of reading done today. I hope to get through Hegel and Eco today.  In regard to blogs... I'm always impressed by  urlLink Doctor Frank  from the  Mr. T Experience 's blog. He writes pretty long essays about all sorts of things for his blog, and relatively consistent at that. Speaking of Dr. Frank, I wonder if Suzanne knows about his solo shows next month in LA?  I wonder if I should put more thought into my blogs?  Sometimes I get political and sometimes I get... dare I say... emo... in my blog. I'd like to think that in the endless ramble, there's something significant and worth saying.  **

      [14809]  This week has been interesting. So Wednesday night I had dinner and watched a DVD with Ai. I also got my new  T(I)NC  shirt, CD, and Burning Heart sampler CD that day. Thursday I felt kind of sick so I opted to not go to class. (I need to learn to stop wearing shorts when it's 50 degrees out). I spent the whole day drinking tea and sleep and I feel better now, bessides the lingering phlegm. What was really weird was the fact that I emailed my professor to say that I was ill and wouldn't make it to class, and she replied back saying that class was cancelled due to someone jumping off our library tower. Apparently the guy is still alive right now. It's a 16 story building.  Some patterns in life in one asking oneself existential questions. People have told me that this reoccuring pattern isn't necessarily a bad thing and it simply demonstrates my good qualities. While I do find it an honorable thing, I question my mettle for dealing with such things. I don't really want to get into a lot of detail here, but some people will get what I'm talking about.  I need to go to school today and make photocopies.  **

      [14802]  Here I am at school killing time before class. I should really read more though. I have another 40-50 or so pages to read in addition to the 40 I just read. 40-50 pages seems to be my attention span limit and I usually read that in about an hour.  This morning I managed to have breakfast, take out the trash, and go grocery shopping. Not to shabby, but I should really jog in the mornings.  I've noticed that I feel exhausted until afternoon regardless of how much sleep I get and it's always hard to get up for me. But I'm getting used to the getting up between 7-8 AM thing now, which is good. I'm more productive than I was last year, but I could be more productive. 'Cause from 5 PM - 1 AM, I'm usually doing jack shit.  Something that's somewhat related to the whole "growing up" thing I wrote about earlier, is my schizophrenia. I really do have multiple personalities tugging away at me. There's always been the side of me that's all about sophistication. I enjoy opera, good cooking and fine wine. I try to know a lot about the world, science, and other random facts. Part of this stems from the fact that I really don't like how my parents are. I see my dad, for example, as loud ignorant and obnoxious. It's not that I don't like him, but he's just really annoying. He tries to act like he knows everything too. My mom rarely wants to expand her horizons and just sits around worrying about things all day. I've always tried to always be expanding my horizons and not be ignorant. That's why I try to know as much about the music I listen to, read science articles in the news, try new recipes and try new things.  However, the classy and sophisticated side often clashes with the part of me that enjoys violence, chaos, and all sorts of fucked up shit. I'm a dangerous person, when I get bored. That's when I do stupid stuff like lighting things on fire and end up doing bodily harm to myself. People are often shocked when they find out how, "Martha Stewart," I am in my cooking and crafts abilities. Is this stuff the still purveying immaturity still active in me?  Maybe I need a hobby to get this stuff out of my system? Hitting the gym? A sport or something?  Anyway... I've been listening to some  A.F.I.  recently. I also burned myself a new mixed CD.  **

      I'm 23 and I always feel a pull between wanting to stay young and having to grow up.  People say I've done a lot in my life despite my age. I was an athelete, musician, involved in student government in high school. I've volunteered at high schools, coached wrestling, and worked 4 very different jobs. I had 2 majors and a minor and I'm in a phd program right now. I've seen cities all over California, and been to Reno, Vegas, Taiwan, Mexico, and Western Europe. I've stage dove, moshed, been to operas and musicals, the great museums of the world and been to a fringe festival more or less. I've seen a punk rock midget, S&M people, prostitutes in Amsterdam, and met pro-wrestlers. I've been drunk, beaten, bloody, and burned. I've been in newspapers and I have many friends. You would think that I've lived enough to grow up. Or perhaps since I've lived an interesting life, I'm reluctant to grow up.  This growing up thing, where I should act and dress more respectably is tough. At some point in the next few years, I'll end up teaching college course and eventually be called professor... I'll have to look and act professional. I can't be as nihilist or apathetic as I am now. I shoud be worrying about getting a job when I graduate and becomeing "successful." Yet I'm still in a phase of my life right now where I still want to stage dive at shows, crush beer cans with my skull, and wear punk band shirts.  The fact that I was annoyed at the lack of chaos and mayhem at last night's grad student party makes me aware of unwillingness or inability to "grow up." I had a good time last night, but there wasn't the drunken revelry that representative of what I want in my life.   I think of the  Descendents  song "When I get old."  ***

      [14793]   So last night a friend told me that it was obvious that someone likes me. I suppose I should figure out if I like someone back right?  Anyway, yesterday Andy visited and we walked around downtown, ate at the Roaring Fork, watched  Daredevil  and went to the party at Jeff's.  It was cool. Andy is my first visitor. The Roaring Fork is pretty good, and the place is much nicer on the inside than you would think from the outside. It's somewhat pricey, but I guess the food is good and you do get soup or salad and 2 sides with whatever you order. I was disappointed by the beer selection, because usually those rustic themed places have good beer. It was just room temperature Labatt.  Daredevil wasn't bad or good. The logical gaps just made it annoying and there were some problems with the flow of the story.  The party was good. It was you're usual excessive drinking and talking to fellow grad students or complaining about school stuff type talk. Andy, Wataru, Tami, Ai and I went to Kennedy Fried Chicken around 2:30 AM to get some nuggets. Then Andy and I had to wait around for an hour for a cab to take us home.  Andy left this afternoon after eating at the Phoenician.  So now... I'm at the library checking out books  ***

      Yep yesterday was 9/11...  There's been talk about the patriotism associated with the massacre and how the government has used the event. Some people actually say that government knew about the event just like they knew about Pearl Harbor. As much as I hate the government... and while I believe in the heinous logic of the government, I'm somewhat hesitant to believe that Roosevelt and or Bush are evil enough to have allow for American casualties on the level of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. I think that it's more likely that certain people in their administrations knew about such things and perhaps did not let know either president know about it. Our government has many heads, and I'm not talking about checks and balances. We have the military, intelligence agencies, and various departments that control policy. The executive does not completely control their actions and descisions.  Anyway... last night I went to the Belmar with Wataru and hung out with some folks there. It was slow last night though.  Johnn Cash and John Ritter just died.... so sad.  ***

I only happened to travel 2600 miles a way from the center of the film industry.

Too bad 'cause it would have been cool to find a pint of Caffrey's in the city despite it being owned by Adolph Coors. Oh well, I get to show Andy around next week.

      I was up a bit before 6 AM talking to Esther about her potential trip to NYC.  Then I managed to go for a 1.5 - 2 mile jog around 6:30 AM, showering and making breakfast afterwards. After all that good stuff, I went grocery shopping and I'm currently doing laundry.  I'm a productive bastard today aren't I?  I want to get something off my chest. I think that I should perhaps lower my standards when it comes to women. Seriously, in the past 3 years of my life I've only met one girl who I could say without a shadow of a doubt I want a serious relationship with. There have been dates, girls for challenge, and girls I wouldn't mind boning; however, there's only been one who really charmed me and continues to charm me. A relationship with her isn't a reality for many reasons. That I accept, but when it comes to meeting girls in the past year... they've had to live up to a standard set by this amazing girl. I don't know if that's healthy. This girl once told me that it's perhaps good to know what you want. But perhaps I'm not being fair and open enough to other "types" of girls? It's tough.  A lot of this messy thinking comes from seeing this young lady a few weeks ago. I hadn't really thought of her much for several months until I saw her again. She was really hot and just talking to her made my heart race. I really don't know what it is about her. There's a line dividing being over her and liking her again, and sometimes she tempts me to cross that line.  I just remembered that I forgot to buy berries. Fuck.  Anyway... hopefully new opportunities will present themselves this year.   I'm listening to some  Dropkick Murphys   ***

      I think the presentation could have used some red to make it better visually. I was thinking about putting some diced tomatos on top for that purpose, but alas I didn't.     Breakfast ain't bad, but for some reason my potatoes have been coming out kind of dry. It's either package or I'm doing something different. The oil?  It might have something to do with the fact I'm using olive oil instead of a generic vegetable oil. The smoking point for olive oil is 375°F. That means the pan can't get nearly as hot as a generic vegetable oil that smokes at 425°F or higher. I belive butter is around 300°F. The lack of heat makes it harder to get that crisp outside without drying it out.   I should brew some coffee for that extra pick up when reading huh? I'm going through my can of coffee pretty quick, but then again I put like 5 times the suggest amount of grounds into the filter. I should also probably brew double so that I can just nuke a cup some mornings.  In other food news, I should probably pick up some frozen berries for a smoothie. The weather's been nice... in the 70s the past few days. It'd be nice to chill with a smoothie.  After I'm done with my work on campus, I'll watch  the Pianist  tonight with my left over pizza. I wonder if it's as good / as sad as Steff hyped it up to be. I remember the last time she hyped up a movie ( Amelie ) and I was disappointed.  Speaking of film... what should I do my research on this semester!? Newsreels? Political films?  ***

      [14738]  I've noticed viewership of my blog has dropped a bit.  Potatoes cooking right now.  Anyway... today I plan on going to campus around 12:35 to do the following:  Get reading done for the 2 art history courses, and FINISH a paper.  Tomorrow I plan on going to the grocery store and picking up:   Green bell pepper Black pepper Salad dressing Chicken breasts Orange Juice   Then going to campus to pick up a book at the bookstore and sitting in on a class.  **

      [14734]  Friday was uneventful aside from getting my bluetooth adapter. I managed to do some file transfer between my computer and phone.  Today I managed to get stuff done. I did a lot of photocopying and got 40 pages of reading. Not bad for today. Note to self: bring sunglasses when you know you'll be doing a lot of copying.  Hopefully being more active this semester will aid in getting my brain back in shape. A rather cute girl initiated a conversation with me at the copiers, but my wit has been retarded by 12 hrs of sleep daily and lots of beer. I plan on cutting back to 7 hrs and doing more brain exercising like art.   Pizza dough rising right now. I decided to use 6 cups of flour for aproximately 6 pizzas worth of dough. Hopefully I multiplied things right.  ***

      [14727]  So tired, but I have class in about 45 minutes.  I went to sleep around 1:30 and woke up around 10... but I kept hitting the snooze button for 3 hrs.  I should have went to sleep earlier, but I was engaged in a discussion on human sexuality.  I'll probably try to make it to the Belmar tonight. I haven't been there in a while.  I hate it when the reserve library doesn't have books I need right away. I need to budget my time really well this year. 16 units plus research papers.  Tomorrow I need to pay Walmart a visit.  I need groceries as well as a towel.  **

      A short conversation... eh more like a few words... with Esther about rain reminded me of some really fond memories of rain growing up. It was... I believe 6th grade and Erica and I went out in the rain gather up all sorts of slugs, snails, and worms. That was really fun, especially melting them all with salt and making a big mess where other kids keep their backpacks. Then I remember Siobhan hearing about the whole thing and being totally grossed out.   Yes I was an interesting kid growing up.   Class starts... today! in 13 hrs! Woohoo!  Other notes: Lemon pepper chicken on pizza with green bell peppers rock!  ***

      I was pretty close to buying a Pennywise and Ignite shirt, but with the shipping being $10 in addition to them being long sleeves costing $19 each... I opted not to spend $50 on two shirts. It would be so much cheaper if I picked them up at a show.  I haven't put up any political or commentary in a while, so I'll put something up.  I've always been anti the use of the word  liberal  and  conservative  because those words describe poles of the American political system, but don't actually describe reality. Because they are polar, they are used the same way good and evil, or black and white, or them and us are used. I'm not a believer in absolutes and think that the world is much more complex than people who use such terms like to think. It's not simply shades of grey that describe reality, but a spectrum of colors. Take the whole thing with Arnold and McClintock on the Republican side of the California Recall election. McClintock keeps calling Arnold a liberal in order to discredit him. However, Arnold has many conservative view points such as his support for past "conservative" propositions. So is Arnold a liberal just because he supports gay unions (not marriage), abortion, etc.? McClintock is basically try to make the point that Arnold is with "them" and not with "us" (the Republicans), in order to gain support. The sad thing is Arnold has been trying to act conservative in order to get those "conservative" votes rather than simply be himself. He's buying into the bullshit terms.  If I could still vote in California would I still vote for Arnold? Yes I would. Simply because I think he will make an interesting governor. I don't really believe any one man will single handidly end the financial crisis. There are larger issues such as the national economy affecting California's crisis. I do think that Arnold is moderate enough to be a decent governor and he does really care about things like schools and education.  Ok... I've been up for 2 hrs now. I'm tempted to back to sleep, but I don't wanna screw up my sleep patterns. I wanna try to be up at 7:30 again tomorrow morning.  I'm actually looking forward to school starting up. A brand new start and I hope I'll be more studious this year. I've never been the hardest working student. I really need to change my habits so that I do better. I mean... I do pretty damn well for the effort I put into school, but I barely do any work. If I actually put in half the time I put into surfing the web or sleeping, then I could probably pull out something really impressive. We'll see.  In random play so far I've heard the  Muffs ,  Descendents , and some  NOFX  /  Rancid 's split album.  ***

      Last night I hung out with Tami and Wataru... had a pitcher + of beer. I was quite buzzed when I got home.  I actually managed to get up early today. Alas the rain is keeping me from runnning this morning. Yea, I know... I should run anyway... but the weather report says it's like 58 right now. I don't wanna freeze my ass off.  I had weird dreams and little rest the past few nights.  ***

      I went grocery shopping and I'm gonna go to campus in a bit.  It's amazing. It took 2 days for me to receive my Tower Records order... it came from Sacramento too.  Alas my Kung Fu Records sampler's case is totally fucked up. Cracks everywhere. It's annoying. I sent Joe Escalante a message on Friendster. Hah.   Streetcore  needs a few more listens before I write a review.  **

      [14992]  The call forwarding works, and I see a blue arrow next to the number if it's a forwarded call. So I can screen calls better. Given that it was about 10 AM... I'm betting that number that just called was a telemarketer. They always seem to call around this time.  I'm guessing some of the posts on my chatterbox are by Brandon. Right? By the way I know you don't like Kung Fu Records, but I just ordered the Kung Fu Records sampler. I needed an extra $5 to get free shipping on the Tower Records' webpage. I ordered that and Joe Strummer's  Streetcore . I wanted to use up my $10 gift certificate. I ended up paying like $11 for 2 CDs... well actually 3, the sampler is 2 CDs. Not too bad.  I'm gonna go to campus in about 15 minutes. I need to read something before class.  I'm listening to  Stiff Little Fingers  before catching the bus.  ***

      Yes the  Blondie  song is good, but I say call me for another reason.  You know Binghamton is really in the boonies when it is one of the only Verizon phone markets that don't offer voice mail service.  Anyway I figured out that I should just get all my calls forwarded to my cell phone, since that has all the nifty caller ID and voice mail services already.  Well I was at least somewhat productive on my "day off." I seriously feel like my body has been put in a blender for the past week and a half. Mentally I've been out of it and physically I feel sore and weak. I really don't know what it is. Vitamin deficiency? A virus of some sort? I managed to get some writing done, which is good seeing as how I have 6 weeks of school left. I actually have good chunks of writing down. They're disorganized and mostly brain stormish paragraphs, but 10 pages worth of  something  is something. That's in addition to the 6 I already handed in. So basically I have 50 pages left to do. 10 a week? Damn it I better get cracking.  I didn't let this rice steam long enough, but my steak was already done. That's what I get for not timing things right.  **

      [14979]  I've really been out of it the past few days in regards to my perception of time and space. I think it has something to do with leaving the lights on when I sleep, weird dreams that mimick reality, daylight savings and oversleeping. I've just been really unsure of time.  Anyway apparently after disucssion with my professor, my paper's topic is more narrow. Basically more of an Althusserian / Anti-Althusserian analysis of the Motion Picture Patents Company and the judicial arm of the state.  **

Hey, it's 'cause someone was dressed up as a luchadore and when Albert sees pro-wrestling imagery of any kind he really gets into it.   Hmm daylight savings?  The cool think about Kennedy Fried Chicken is that it stays in your system for while, thus you're not super hungry 12 hours later.  Ok time to shower, get some work done, and then finish watching  Gangs of New York .  **

      Especially orange herbal tea. In my cupboard, I have that, some apple cinnamon, chinese tea, green tea, and earl grey. Only the green and earl grey are caffeinated though.  So I was wrong, the party is tomorrow night. I ended up watching  Red Dragon  instead. It was quite good.  On campus today I looked up some articles that I might want to use for my paper for my methods class. I decided to take a look at an Asian American journal. Why? Simply because it came up in my search, and there were some interesting articles about Asian-American and African-American subcultural ties. I also want money and I think I might be able to get some from the Asian and Asian American studies program.  I feel like a fake and sell out for experessing interest in the program because of money. But hey... when I got here, people assumed that I had interest in that field simply because of the color of my skin. That's like automatically assuming homosexuals want to study gay/lesbian issues, or women study gender. That's not to say that I don't care about issues concern Asian Americans, but those issues are secondary to my primary interests. I want to study things like popular culture and media. Yes issues concerning minority groups are a part of those subjects, but I only really want to study that stuff if it comes up within the larger project.  I am a fake not just because of money. I'm a fake because I've always had a tenuous relationship with the Asian-American community. I fall incredibly far from stereotypes and norms. I'm not an overachiever, I don't listen to rap / pop, I didn't drive a Honda, I think raving is stupid, my fashion sense is totally different, I don't play LAN games, nor do I do the thug thing. I'm a goatee and sometimes mohawk sporting, punk loving, t-shirt and shorts wearing, crazy, don't give a shit about status, wannabe anarchist. I go to things like Taiwanese student events, because I feel that indeed being Taiwanese is part of my identity and I'm paying homage to my heritage. However, those things make me feel awkward, because I'm always reminded of how out of place I am at those things.  Hell the way I speak is different too. I remember when I was dating Rose, and she pointed out that it was obvious from my English that my Mandarin was weak. It's true, my Mandarin is weak, and you can somewhat tell with second generation Chinese their skill from their English. There is a sort of ring to how they speak that signifies that technically Chinese was their first language (only by a few years to English). People are actually surprised when they realize that I can understand Mandarin, since I don't have that ring. I, for example, never say "lah" or "loh" at the end of my sentences in either language. It's little things like that. Hell for some reason, lots of Taiwanese people think I'm Japanese.  Do you see some the contradictions yet? I'm pulled in many directions based on many different perceptions by others and even myself. It's complicated.  Time to shower and then do some work.  ***

      [14947]  Ok so my plan for today:    Now: Go through my ILL books.  2:00 PM-ish: Go to campus to mail  Me, Myself, and Irene  back, return books, and photocopy stuff.  Probably 4:00 PM: Come home and clean.  Do some writing.  Decide what to make for dinner.  Maybe go grocery shopping.  9:30: Maybe go to a party.

      [14945]  That's 2 days in a row of some working out. I remember when I used to be able to do sets of 50 push ups and do like 200 in one session. That was between my junior and senior years of high school. Of course I was 30 lbs lighter and in good shape then. I right now I'm doing 3 sets of 20ish per setting. Crunches I used to practically go forever. It was ridiculous to count, as I'd just go until I was tired. Now it's something like 200 a session. Maybe I'll get some weights tomorrow after I return my books. I think it was late last year that Hueter commented on how I used to be a rock and didn't have an ounce of fat on me. I used to be much tougher than I am now. I want my toughness back.  After I go shower, I'm going to go through my ILL books since they're due tomorrow. Fuck I hate Binghamton's library. I was bitching about how the UCI Main Library got renamed to the Langson Library, but now I see the importance of selling out. We need books damn it!  This weekend I have 3 objectives. I need to get my 602 papers done. I've been saying that for months now, but I'm serious about that. At least 1 of the 2 need to get done this weekend. I also need to get chunks of my 2 art history papers thought out. I'll probably do some tonight, since I need to return books tomorrow.  There's a hottie that I've run into 3 days in a row now. That's a good thing.  ***

      [14939]  Maybe I'm getting old, but more mellow / interesting stuff seem to give me more pleasure these days. I managed to get 1 song from  Streetcore , "Coma Girl." It's a good song. It makes me hungry for more Strummer and the Mescaleros.   The new Anti-Flag CD is good, but I don't think it's as good as  Underground Network  or  A New Kind of Army . Could it be the touch Tom Morello of  Rage Against the Machine ?  Some of the songs seem to beckon for Zack de la Rocha's rapping more than Justin Sane's shrill battle cry with the rest of the band's anthem-like chants.  This seems more present in songs like "Postwar Breakout," which seems to recall the vibe of "The Panama Deception" from  Underground Network . "Sold as Freedom" seems to recall "Until It Happens To You." While the songs are different, there are some similarities in these early listenings. Anyway my favorite songs so far are "Turncoat," "Rank N File," and "O.I.L."  This hasn't been a very exceptional year for punk. Let's take a look at some of the full album acquisitions I've made this year.     Dropkick Murphys  -  Blackout  - This is by far my favorite album of the year. I give  Do or Die  a slight edge, but this album is amazing in a comparing apples and oranges kind of way. Both are tasty, but you have a preference. *****   Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  -  Take A Break  - This album is so much fun, as all their albums are. ****    NOFX  -  War on Errorism  - Nothing brilliant, but a good album that is fun and has a lot of thought put into it. ****    A.F.I.  -  Sing the Sorrow  - A very good album, and is one of their more solid over-all albums. ****   Pennywise  -  From the Ashes  - Incredibly generic. **   Rancid  -  Indestructible  - This album is a joke and is a stain upon Rancid's discography. *   Randy  -  Welfare Problems  - Eh? It just didn't click like their other albums. *   Anti-Flag  -  The Terror State  - See above for comments. ***   Ozma  -  Spending Time on the Boderline  - Some good songs, but it's not really completely new as some of those songs, they've been playing live for years. ***   T(I)NC  -  Bigger Cages, Longer Chains  [EP] - Good stuff, but there's a reason why these songs didn't make it onto  A New Morning, Changing Weather . ***   The Moving Units  -  Self Titled  [EP] - A couple of songs and decent. ***   AM Radio  -  Radioactive  - Overrated with one or 2 good tracks, but lots of unlistenable tracks. **   Here's some stuff I don't have the whole album, but some general impressions:     Joykiller  -  Ready Sexed Go  - So far so good, but not 5 star.   Lost Patrol  -  Songs About Running Alway  - I think it will be very good, potential 5 star.   Rooney  -  Self-Titled  - Not really my thing, but is listenable.   The Ataris  -  So Long Astoria  - I'd say most likely a 3.   Motion City Soundtrack  -  I Am The Movie  - Some very good songs, but a lot of the songs are kind of annoying.   Manic Hispanic  -  Mijo Goes to Jr. College  - I'd say most likely a 3. You can't too wrong with covers. I've only heard Code Brown though.   Brand New  -  Deja Entendu  - Emo on Epitaph... all the emo kids seem to be really into them right now. I don't plan on downloading more than I already have, if that's any indication of my opinion.   White Stripes  -  Elephant  - If only Jack's voice wasn't as bad as Billy Corgan's.   The Mars Volta  -  De-Loused in Comatorium  - I don't see the appeal whatsoever.   The Raveonettes  -  Self Titled  - I've heard worse.   Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros  -  Streetcore  - I think it will be brilliant.

      It's a bit past 5 and I think when I'm done with this post, I'll go take a nap before doing some reading.  There's a lot of new music out this week that I want. I want the new  Anti-Flag  and  Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros  CDs. Those are two artists that are new discoveries from the past few years that I've come to really like. Anti-Flag is pure political punk goodness and Joe Strummer is simply some good rock.  I remember when Joe Strummer died, I was disappointed because he had just been on stage with Mick Jones and there were rumblings that the Clash might reunite for their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I also kicked myself for not going to see him and the Mescaleros complaining that $25 wasn't worth it. His death coincided with... something else. Let's just say the night following his death was an interesting night for me.  Something else I'd like to comment on is a conversation Cissa and I had yesterday. I think I can relate in some ways to her unhappiness, although in many ways I'm obviously different. I'm certainly unsatisfied with my environment and I can't say I'm happy. I too, don't know where I'm headed in life either. There is a voice inside of me that keeps saying, "What's the point of all this?" I mean, sure I  can  finish my phd. I know I can, but what happens then? Jobs are hard to come by, and the whole field of academia is a rough terrain. If I don't navigate it well enough, I could be stuck in a Binghamton-like town and be unhappy there as a continuance of the boredom of graduate school. There, too are days I just don't feel like getting up out of bed, because of a lack of motivation. I lack motivation, because the prize at the end of the tunnel isn't enticing enough.  I do like my classes and I do like what I'm working on in those classes. I just feel a lack of satisfaction in everyday life and it keeps me from focusing on my work.  **

      [14933]  I think I need to take more vitamins or something. Or eat more nutritious food... or exercise! My energy levels are so inconsistent. Some days I'm literally dragging myself out of bed and can barely function, then other days I go 24 hrs with no sleep.  So last night Flo accidentally called me Steff when I IMed her. I'm sure it's possible she could have read it Stefferboy or something like that in the midst of major AIMing. However, you would think that the -boy part would signify that I'm not our girly friend. I jokingly asked Steff if I should be offended that Flo called me that. Her response was, "Hey, I'm offended that you'd be offended if someone called you Steff. I rule." This is the 2nd time someone has called me Stephanie this year. Those bastarrds in AM Radio did it this summer!   Sorry Steff, but Alberts rule more than Stephanies.  I have class at 4:25 today. I need to brush up on my readings for today's mock trial on Althusser. I got the basics of the arguments down, but I don't have indepth grasp of it. I also need to photocopy stuff for class tomorrow and do my readings for Weber. I'd rather sleep though. I just had another massive burrito for lunch.  I've been listening to a lot of  Pulley  and  Me First And The Gimme Gimmes  lately.  **

      ... yet lazy means the continuance of being hungry, until which time it gets so bad you have to do something about it. I should really buy more frozen foods.  It feels late, but it's still early.  I need to read some Althusser and Hirst today. I also need to do an outline and other stuff. Back to business.  A bagel is quick and easy.  **

      [14926]  I slept way too much. I slept through the whole Greyhound trip home and then slept for another 3 hrs when I got home. Of course the fact I got back to Kelly's at 4 AM and woke up at 10 this morning is probably a factor.  So I went to NYC on Friday morning leaving Binghamton at 7:30AM, dropped my stuff off at Kelly's at 11 AM and wandered around before meeting up with Steff. It was cool sitting around at a Starbucks reading the  New York Times . I miss reading real newspapers. There's a different feel to it than reading things online. It was just cool sitting there with a coffee and paper. I wonder if I should subscribe to a paper? I'm sometimes a day or two behind in regards to news.  Anyway I met up with Steff and then we went to her hotel, so she could check in, and then we went to the Hayden Planetarium for her to take pictures of it. She was disappointed at the remodelling of the building. Then we trekked through Central Park to meet up with Dan at the Met. We got there a bit before Dan at around 5:15 PM and hung out on the steps. That would have been cooler with better weather. We wandered around the Met for a couple hours and then went down to NYU and got food, before Steff and I went to go meet up with Nai at the Port Authority. After that I went back to Kelly's to crash by 1:30 AM ish?  I was up at 9 AM yesterday and hung out with Kelly and Prachant until about noon, and then went to meet up with Steff, Nai and Julia. We then went down to Little Italy and ate. When I say ate, we really ate. We had an extremely large meal with lots of wine. We had one of those larger bottles of wine and we all got seriously buzzed. I think at that point Steff was getting irritated with my constant teasing of her for a whole day. It didn't help when we were joking around and pushing one another that one of my pushes caused her to fly into a glass door. I felt bad and realized I had to tone down the jokes. Now that I think about it, I treat her a lot like my brother. Anyway... back to the narrative. After that huge meal we went to the NY Public Library, which is awesome, and then we all split up. I went to go meet up with my family for dinner while the others took off to do their own thing. So it was more food. I mean I ate some eggs and potatoes for breakfast around 11:30AM and ate that huge lunch from 1 PM to 3 PM and then ate dinner at 6:30 ish. Then I had dessert with wine back at Kelly's place!  So after all that I went to go meet up with Julia at the hotel around 8:50 and we hung out at the hotel making fun of an orange phallic looking squash until 10, in which I took off to meet up with Suzy and Ashok. I got to the bar (Ruby's Tap House) around 10:30 and we did a fair about of drinking until a bit past 12, when we went to another bar (Fuel). There things got interesting, because Ashok dropped some dude's ID into the gutter and it became a big scene with people all working hard to win Ashok's $40 bounty to get the ID out. People were sticking sticks with gum at the end to fish it out. Alas it wasn't meant to be. Then us 3 guys ended up wandering aroud until 3-something trying to find a place where they don't card so the dude can get in. That wasn't meant to be either, so we parted ways and I got back to the apartment around 4 AM.  This morning I pretty much stood in line with the girls as they attempted to get show tickets, before taking a bus home.  Yep it was a good weekend.  I'm desperate need of groceries now though.  ***

      Indeed I will be getting out of town.  There's a girl who is like a drug. I like how I feel when I talk to her. Her charm and wit affects me by making a sensation of relaxation fill my muscles as I slink back and smile. She tempts me with feelings. That is she makes me feel. She makes me feel sorrow, joy, contentment, good, and bad all at once. I like simply feeling something, anything... but at the same time I desire more. I want her? It's 'cause this desire, like an addiction leads to path that doesn't end... and you walk and walk until you wear yourself out. Walking and walking, or perhaps talking and talking is more like it. Things are said that are more than just words. In them there is meanings that I don't know if are real or not. If they are embedded by her mind or mine? Tonight I shall resist, but will I keep my promise to myself to continue resisting? This girl is the first girl I can say I really liked, without doubt. She's too special and that's why she's the only person I had a serious thing for and stayed friends with. That's why I need to resist.  *

      May it's because of Emogame, but I definately had a video game themed dream last night.  When my alarm went off, it was a real bitch to turn  it off. I was in so much pain getting up, walking over to it, and getting back into bed.  It's a bit better now, but my back is not feeling too good.  I have about 2 pages written for 607. I think I need to lie down and let my back recover.  *

      Last night I slept for 13 hours!  It was glorious as it was a really nice sleep. I think the combination of a hurt back and beer had something to do with it.  Yea I have a hurt back. I didn't bend at the knees, when picking something up. It was just a few books too. Nothing heavy. Hopefully the booze I will drink tonight will ease the pain.  I have a shitload of work to do. I need to get cracking on my paper for 607, actually read all the books I checked out, and do readings for my classes. Yea fun fucking stuff!  I'm looking forward meeting up with Steff, Nai, and Julia next week in NYC. Partying with my lady friends on a distant place once again. We've done London, Edinburgh, LA, and now New York City. This will rock. Also the meeting of boardies should be most excellent as well.   My plan for tonight and the next few days:    TODAY:  Go home, do some writing, make dinner (teriyaki chicken?), go to party.  TOMORROW:  Go to campus and study, go to TASC movie thing.  SUNDAY:   I really need to get my incomplete for 602 done.  MONDAY:   Get shit done! Read for classes mostly.   Oh yea and  Lost Patrol  is addicting. Dennis Lyxzén is the fucking man. Refused, The (International) Noise Conspiracy, and Lost Patrol are so different yet so good. It's like the perfect buffet.  ***

      [14864]  My last post makes reference to our capitalist system and the importance of wealth. The need for wealth and money is something that permeates our thinking today is significant not only because of ideology, but because we exist in a society in which we need money to "survive." We have to get a job to make money to pay for our dwellings and food. This system makes it so that certain types of knowledge, namely types of knowledge that correlate with industry or a specific profession have higher prestige. But what about ones with lesser prestige?  This question came about, because recently it's been a topic that I've encountered. Steff mentioned that she had a little debate with Hayden over this, and Melanie discussed her not seeing the importance of philosophy, when she needed to find a job. I recently posted on Brian Holland's Friendster profile a testimonial that jokes about biology's popularity as opposed to the humannities and social sciences. So what about a field like the humanities? That field has even less directly tied professions than the social sciences.   I'd say that stuff like literature, history, philosophy and foreign languages are incredibly important in regards to producing a well rounded individual that has a larger understanding of what people have thought about certain issues, and how they dealt with those issues. Maybe Hegel isn't the best philosopher for creating an understanding of the world, but reading stuff like Englightenment philosophers, or Frankfurt school people allows one to understand our society and government. Also literature can be inspirational or delve deep into the human psyche. They uses of the knowledge, admittingly, does not have high exchange-value. However, the cultural capital that this adds to an individual is indispensible.   Anyway, that's just a little ramble...  I'm listening to  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes  again and eating left over spaghetti as the laundry is being done.  I need to do a quick review of some readings before class at 1.  ***

      A friend of mine told me that she feels kind of sad that her vote might be said to have been, “wasted.” Essentially the system is trying to tell you whom you ought to vote for on the basis of who has the best chance of defeating the one you don't want. This is as opposed to voting for someone you'd honestly like to be in office.  To me the problem with this lies within the so-called democracy in our country, a problem that people such has Noam Chomsky have often discussed. How does this apply to the California recall? We live in a plutocratic system and Arnold is the embodiment of government by the wealthy. He said it himself that he is so rich that he can’t be bought off; however, that doesn’t mean that he can’t buy us off.  Many bought into the glitz and glamour around his Hollywood persona. He is after all THE action star of the late 1980s and 1990s. You don’t even have to identify Arnold who. The name Arnold says it all. That’s not to say that I am against Arnold, nor am I for Arnold. What I’m saying is that many people voted for the wrong reason.   So who is Arnold? He is certainly no independent. He’s had long standing relationships with high profile Republicans for years. He has also long admitted to being a fiscal conservative. I take that to mean essentially the neo-liberal economic policies that most rich Americans and Republicans tout as a good thing. He is big money and the question is if he will put his interests as a member of America’s elite over that of the people. I have to admit that his more liberal social attitudes and a strong focus on education make him perhaps the most appealing Republican I’ve seen. Other than that he has been quite vague about his policies, which I don’t fault him for. These are issues that people not enough people care about. I personally don't think Arnold is THAT bad.   I’ll keep this short… Lenin said something along the lines of democracy still meaning state, despite being better than some other governmental forms. However, the basis of the state is still class oppression or something like that. Remember we live in a plutocratic system? Since I don't believe that a revolution is coming anytime soon, I can only hope for moderate / left leaning social issues in my politicians rather than any sort of economic or political change. There's comfort in apathy.   ***

I have a bunch of separate javascript files that will help me update major chunks of the site, without having to change a bunch of files. I can mess around with the quick nav file to add or remove options without having to change both the main blog and the about me pages.

      ... 70 more to go!  Typing notes seems to take more time. It reduces my reading / note taking speed by maybe 40%. I think this will be more useful though. 'Cause then I'll have a file, that I can file away for easier reference. That would be much better than digging through stacks of papers.  As you can see, I'm still  learning  how to study. Well not so much study, but archive and store what I study so that it's more easy to reference. As an undergrad if I forgot something, it wasn't really a big deal. Now I need to sort of build up a body of knowledge. Eric told me that saving notes will save me time later when I have to teach, and I think that perhaps I should follow his advice. I'm already seeing the benefit, as I can easily pull quotes out of my  digital  notes for use in papers.  After seeing how my page comes up on a different screen and version of Internet Explorer... I want to make some tweaks to the HTML. I need to add line breaks following in the archive section, as well as to take into account older browsers with poor stylesheet support.  I've got the munchies... I only had 1 small bagel and some fries today so far.   I forsee pizza for dinner tonight.  ***

      I woke up this morning to  Me First and the Gimme Gimme 's "Stand by Your Man" from their  Blow in the Wind  (2001).  I keep playing around with my page, rather than getting actual work done. Last night I was sort of angry with myself, due to my inability to get  real  work done. I guess at least I'm "producing" something.  This page is certainly less  visual  in terms of graphics and a lot more javascript and stylesheet powered in terms of HTML. I think I might change that as right now the right hand section is blank. I was thinking of working some visuals into that column, as well as maybe some transparent gifs up top. I also removed a lot of old stuff / pics off the server. I'll be working some of those details out in the near future.  I think I'll head to campus (assuming it's open) to get work done around 2 - - I hope!  **

      [14844]   A little writing is better than no writing right? I wrote a paragrah yesterday and a paragraph today.  Let's backtrack a bit shall we?  Friday night I just went out drinking with Wataru at Thirsty's. That place is pretty cheap, has food, and live music. Afterwards, we hung out at Tami's for a while.  Saturday I did jack shit. I woke up in the afternoon and ate breakfast at like 2 PM. Then I lounged around, played Arcanum, watched  Star Trek: Insurrection , and surfed the web.   Star Trek was a good movie. I think it might be because I haven't watched any Star Trek in a long time. I'm looking forward to getting Nemesis next on Netflix.  Today is better. I woke up before noon... like 11:30-ish, and managed to clean the stove top, eat a bagel and some Quaker instant oatmeal, and write a paragraph or two... the two if you count some revisiing and editting of previously written stuff.  Ya know, every week or perhaps everyday, I wake up telling myself that I need to get shit done... and I never do. I have more than enough time to do it, but I don't. I really need to get in the groove of getting shit done. 'Cause I really do feel fear, when I think that I have only 2 months of school left for the semester and I have 70 pages of writing to get done. 70 pages to get done, and they're not allowing for any incompletes this semester. I think I have roughly 2-3 pages of brain storming written though... which is a start.  I think I need to have a plan and stick with it. I was thinking about getting weights, but I know I might buy them and be lazy about working out.  ***

      [14839]  Woke up this morning to "Stacy's Mom" by Fountains of Wayne. Eh...  There's a shadow over me that always reminds me of possibilities if different decisions were made. This shadow may or may not know that she's a shadow over me, but I think she does on a subconcious level at least.  Something I was thinking about on the bus, on my home from grocery shopping earlier this morning was my so-called intellectualy journey. When I went to UCI, I was pretty sure that I wanted to be a history major or possibly an art major. However, I went in undecided for some flexibility. I became a history major officially at the end of my freshman year. I liked being a history major, but I felt an unease with the discipline. As I took more course in other subjects, I found that I had an affinity for sociology, anthropology, art history, and studio art. I felt more and more and disciplinary boundaries were too restrictive for me. I ended up adding sociology as a major at the end of my junior year and finishing a digital arts minor. I felt sociology has enough flexibility as a discipline that I chose it for graduate school. I didn't have to choose a chunk of time-space to be an expert at.  Here at Binghamton, I like how flexible and the freedom I have to interdisciplinary. However, that flexibility has a price. As I get into my 2nd year the looming area papers and the eventual dissertation worry me. I need to narrow my fields of interest down. Scary stuff...  I'm tired...  ***

      I wanted to write this down before I forgot. Last night I dreamt of the members of Bad Religion doing a sort of thing that was in  Stand By Me . It was funny seeing Bobby running.  I'm going to go on a little rant about a gender myth. It's in response to many girls saying that they are, at a given age, more mature than men. I think maturity is more than just biological maturity, but on an emotional or mental level it's not based on sex. There are all sorts of indidvidual psychological as well social conditioning factors. I think my biggest argument against that myth is that there are correlations between that myth and a patriarchal system in which men are designated as financial providers or authoritative figures. Historically, in post-Victorian eras, women relied on men to pay for dates and do paid-labor. Of course, a man's age and time within the workforce affects his wages. This affects the age disparity in male-female relationships.  Anyway, that's my little rant. It's just a pet-peeve I have.  It's still really cold. I'm waiting for the bus in the computer lab right now.  ***

      [15219]  I watched  The Manchurian Canidate  and  Catch Me if you Can  recently.  Those were good movies.   The Manchurian Canidate  is like... wow. Yes the lack of real Asians as important characters, except for as prostitutes was kind of annoying. However, the storyline involving political conspiracy, brainwashing, crazy parents, etc. was great.    Catch Me if you Can  was pretty neat too. It's hard to believe it's a real story. For a real person to do all that before he turned 19 is amazing.  It's the usual Sunday sloth today... I'll get some writing done later. I've noticed I like writing at night better.  I've got a potato baking in the oven... they take forever, yet they're so worth the wait.  I just realized that with the days in Binghamton dwindling, my grocery shopping will have to be cut back.

      So once again the weather prevented me from getting some shopping done. I think it'd be more time efficient if I figure out what video places have  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes  and make it an along the way type thing.  I watched  Monsters Inc.  today. It was a very enjoyable movie. It kind of reminded me of  Little Monsters  with Fred Savage though... only  Little Monsters  didn't have cameos by Woody and Nemo.  I got 2 pages written today! 2 pages plus a whole lot of editting and rearranging of my paper. I spent a good couple of hours today on my  Planet of the Apes  paper. I'm so proud of myself!  Art History 550E: 10/10 (Dec. 15)  Art History 572F: 16/17 (Dec. 10)  Sociology 607: 12/18 (Dec. 16)  Sociology 616: 9/20 (Dec. 11)  Totals: 47 / 65 = 72.3%  Remaining: 18 pages / approx. 13 days = 1.38 per day   Ok now...

I think I should have solid drafts of those papers done this weekend. That is very do-able actually. I should probably get what I need to have written done tomorrow, and then do a print out on Sunday. Print outs are easier for proofing, than on a screen. Then Monday, I'll try to get my ethnography paper into a polished draft format and have it ready for my professor's office hours on Tuesday.  I also have to check with Hollywood Video or Video King to see if they have  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes  because for some reason Netflix didn't send it like it was supposed to this weekend.  That basically means I'll have 16 pages left to complete by the 2nd half of the week.  Wow so I spent $150 on groceries last month. I think that this is because they changed the bus routes and I haven't gone to Walmart for stuff as much... Walmart is cheaper than Giant.  I was going to go grocery shopping today, but the rain convinced me not to go.  18 days until I'm back in California.  ***

      NY drivers suck ass, because they can't stay in their lane. Weaving!? I don't think there were that many drunks out on the road 3 PM... so they have no excuse.  So I drove SeoKyung and Inhye to the Woodbury outlets in Inhye's car. It was a nice little journey. I missed driving. I'd never really talked to Inhye before today. She's nice, but we all pretty much did our own things in the outlet. It was cool getting out of Binghamton for the day. I almost got a jacket at Pacsun, but decided not to. ALthough... it was a jacket perfect for sticking patches on. 4 hrs of driving... afterwards we went to Walmart. I got beer!  I just bought some very expensive  Flogging Molly  tickets. Fuck Ticketmaster! 40% service charges! Motherfucking corporate fucks. Heh... that was fun typing.  Mmm beer.  ***

      My brother got pissed off at me after I made a few comments about his dating of film noir as the 1950s and his review of Matrix Revolutions. He said I have a big ego and I’ve always been like this growing up. He said that I should think about this and how it affects people I’m supposed to care about.   All I can say is whatever. I admit to having a big ego. I know I am a self-centered ass and you know what? I’m perfectly happy being an egoist since I think I deserve my arrogance. I’ve done a lot in my life on my own. I for the most part like who I am. I’ve always been someone that preferred doing his own thing or doing things his own way. It's gotten me pretty far in life. Does that make me an egoist? Sure whatever. That’s why I’ve had so many problems with my (our) parents. So sue me for being a strong individual.   Yea I'm an ass... that doesn't mean I don't give a shit about my brothers feelings, but me being an egoist, thinks he's overreacting over something insignificant... this I don't feel justified in feeling bad.  Hey I’ll admit that I haven’t been the best of big brothers, and that a lot of the shit I pulled growing up spilled heat over onto him. I'll even admit he's been a better brother to me than vice versa. That I’m sorry for, but this is a petty argument. (Yes arrogance shining through again). He’s acting like how my (our) parents would react over something so petty. If that comment offends him, eh… deal with it. If I can make our mom cry without remorse, will blocking me on AIM really get to me? Sorry, but I’m myself and don’t plan on changing.  *

      ...from the bird and the deer who live on the same to the condominiums that litter the plain it took time... time and disregard from the green and the trees that shot high in the air to the high-business market-men who take all that's there it took time... time and disregard - Bad Religion from  Into the Unkown  (1983) Yes... that song is a 7 minute epic.  So like I met with my grad director, and the future grad director today. So it was a 2 on 1 meeting. I feel like Tomich and Lee are extremely responsive and were even suggesting potential research and funding opportunities. India isn't an ideal place to potentially do research, (I would prefer the cool cultural studies places in the UK) but the fact that they made suggestions made me feel good. I guess what I need to do now is narrow down a committee and my areas. I think I'll do that this winter.  Here's a comment... if a seminar is already 3 hrs long, going over 1/2 an hour is brutal... ESPECIALLY if it's before a holiday weekend!  Tomorrow I get to play chauffeur for some friends. Woohoo getting behind the wheel of a car! It's funny when someone admits to not being a good driver and wants you to drive.  So motherfucking  Flogging Molly  at the Hollywood Avalon (formerly known as the Palace) on Jan 10!  I just called Esther and she said she doesn't know if she can go, because she'll be a temporary pirate due to an eye patch after getting eye surgery. Bummer... cause I know she'd appreciate the songs about whiskey and the blaring bagpipes, fiddles, electric guitars and bass. Man I love Celtic punk!  Cookies are in the oven. Maybe I'll write after my cookies.  ***

      I believe that honesty, to one self and to others is always the best policy. We live in a world of such ambiguity that sometimes clarity is pure relief.  I’ve been talking to someone recently, who is flat out  fun . Quite frankly she’s probably the most  fun  person that I’ve met here in jolly old Binghamton. I guess to sum it all up I find her wit absolutely charming. That combined with intelligence, humor, and good looks, you can’t help but go… “Damn, she’s unavailable!?” and secretly think “what ifs.” I guess there's like one lucky dude out there and I’ve gotta give him props. Also if this young lady, whom I know occasionally reads my incessant ramblings, figures out that I’m talking about her, I say take this as a compliment. People should be reminded that they kick ass from time to time.  Yep… that’s one personal thought. The other one is that I’ve been feeling really content lately. I think the fact that I am being productive really improves my mood. This semester is ending on a high note. It was a bit of a drag early on since, I wasn’t happy with a lot of stuff. Now I feel like I’m actually doing something with myself. With only 23 days until I land in LAX, I’m looking forward to a winter break where I can do some reading for the sake of reading. I hope to read some postmodernist theory books, some fiction like Chuck Palahniuk and Sartre, and some non-fiction like  Fast Food Nation . Also some punk rock shows and fun in the sun?  I guess the only time my contentment falters is when I look too deeply into the future. My future is just so vague. Do I have 3 or 4 or 5 years left here? What should I do my area papers on? What about my dissertation? A job!? Yea that’s scary shit.  However, when I look at the here and now. I’m cool. It’s all chill. I think it’s a matter of mentally dealing with modernist conceptions of future desire. The insatiable thirst for progress into the future. That desire, as Buddhists believe, is the source of suffering. I’m by no means a theist of any sort, but contentment is where it is at. Live life day by day and keep shit simple. I certainly don’t mean  carpe diem  - - “seize the day.” That’s too imperative. Like I said, keep shit simple. Like the things I hope to do in the winter are just rough sketches… it’s all really  whatever .   As Arnold says in  Total Recall  - - "Chill out... you'll live longer."  Oh yea... while I'm at it... Happy birthday to Mike while it's his birthday in some time zones and a happy birthday to his cool girlfriend and my buddy Cissa now that it's her b-day on the east coast.  Also a belated happy birthday to Toni-Lynne who's birthday was this past Saturday.  ***

      [15152]  Today was a beautiful day!  Now listening to  Social Distortion's   Mommy's Little Monster  (1983).  Some comments friends made on the  Last Samurai  casting call.  Crystal : um.. im sure for amistaad's after party.. the servers didnt wear shakles and call everyone "massah"   Nick:  Damn, that is both patriarchal and economically exploitative.  still, it's comforting to know that in "ancient Japan, circa 1870's", there were only "beautiful women" Some further thoughts on the issue. Yes, as my brother pointed out, Tom Cruise is a white guy who goes to Japan during the era of the Meiji Restoration to teach the Japanese how to be western. This is something that really did happen and it is cited as one of the reasons why Japan was able to become a regional power by the 20th century. However, the previews for the film show Cruise being captured and joining the samurai, in a time when the samurai warrior class is abolished. However, the question is if he somehow becomes the savior of Japanese tradition.  Furthermore, many of the issues I bring up are directed toward the casting call. Not necessary the movie, since I haven't seen it (yet?)  Today I baked myself two cookies for breakfast. They turned out quite nicely. Did laundry. Got books in the mail and a letter from Julia. Then I did some note taking from the Mezias and Boyle book, because it was over due. Then I went to campus and mailed some stuff, returned books, and did some photocopying. Chatted with some folks, and it looks like I'll probably hang out with them on Wed.  Now listening to  Social Distortion's   Prison Bound  (1988).  In other news, there was apparently another attack on US troops in Iraq, but what was different about this was it was reminiscent of Rwanda in 1993. That's pretty fucked up and it suggests how bad it is in Iraq right now for the people. It often requires conditions that are absolutely abhorrent before people lose it. Look at the American Draft Riots during the Civil War, the Watts Riot of 1965, and the LA Riots of 1991. There were desperatly poor people with nothing to lose, and they got fed up. I can only imagine things getting worse, before they get better.  Something that crossed my mind recently is if all one knew of me is what they read on this blog, what would their impression be of me? This thought is somewhat inspired by my reading / writing for 616. It could be said that just using my blog as the only source of figuring me out wouldn't produce a very "thick" description as Geertz calls it.  ***

      [15142]  My buddy Esther sent me this: Casting beautiful Asian women for Warner Bros. 'The Last Samurai' Premiere After-party to be held in Westwood on Dec 1st.. Women will be dressed as village women from the film's wardrobe department and mingle 'in character' through the party, helping to create the ambience of ancient Japan, circa 1870's. There is no pay. This is kind of messed up, primarily the 'in character' part. First of all, I'm not opposed to the idea of setting a theme. Fine, find Asians, since this is a film set in Japan. However, first why no men? Men can be servants too. Oh wait! It's because Asian women are exotic and submissive! This is such a gendered orientalist event based on exoticized images of the Far East as a seemingly femine weak culture / society. This reeks of stuff that I mentioned that I would love to do a class on a few days ago. Come on! Tom Cruise as a samurai? This movie reeks of the orientalist brashness of Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly.  Oh yea... 1870s is not ancient Japan. The Meiji era already started by this time.  Esther is plotting to go undercover to this event wearing a wire.  Speaking of Madama Butterfly, Steff said she saw it with her friends a few weeks ago. That's one opera I really wanna see live (despite how screwed up it is). I've seen Il Trovatore, Don Giovanni, and La Traviata live. I also want to see Carmen and all of Mozart's operas. Too bad opera is expensive.  On a different topic... more teas should be caffeinated. My orange and apple-cinnamon teas are not caffeinated, but my green, Chinese, and Earl Greys are. Decaf is a bastardization of coffee and tea!  I think I can get my 616 paper in to Prof. Roth at her office hours on Tuesday. A draft perhaps is what I mean. I only have 3 more pages to write to finish paper 1 for that class.  Why does my video capture of the  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes  and the Watts Riots cause my computer to crash when I put it into my PowerPoint presentation? The Century City clip doesn't crash! I think I may have to re-rip that clip from the DVD.  I want to make stuffed chicken breasts again. Maybe tomorrow though.  ****

      [15123]  Yesterday was a nice day. I had a good breakfast, had a shortened class, ate pizza, took a long nap, and had fun hanging out with Melissa.   A day is instantly on a upward trajectory when you start it off with good food. Good food and nice hot cup of coffee simply aims the body and mind toward positivity.   Class yesterday was nice, because it was cut short. It was weird though. Out of the 5 students in the class, only 2 showed up. The best part of the class was when Benita talked about how book covers are chosen. It's a question that I have always wondered about.  Then I went home and made a pizza... mushroom and green bell pepper on a thin crust. That was nice, and then I slipped into a nice long nap. A food induced nap are always best naps. As my buddy Christine would say they're "glorious."  Then I woke up and Melissa IMed me to see if I wanted to catch some free jazz at the Anderson Center. Alas it was sold out, but we managed to still find stuff to do. It was fun, we made fun of ALL the movies in the video store and then finally rented  Italian Job . That was a good movie, by the way. I think it was superior to a movie like  Oceans Eleven  because all the members of the team had real personality. Some of Oceans Eleven's cast simply got lost in the shuffle. Melissa, if you're reading this... on IMDB.com, Matt Damon and Brad Pitt's characters have different last names, so no he can't be his son. Hah.  Oh yea, while I already had the idea in my head, talking to Melissa made the idea seem like an even better idea. Nancy Um had asked a few weeks ago why I didn't apply for any summer teaching in AAASP or something like that, and I replied that I didn't even think of that. (The question actually caught me off guard). Anyway I was thinking that doing something on orientalism and looking at Madama Butterfly and M. Butterfly would be kind of cool. Hell I could even include some Weezer into that discussion. Yes I'd be sort of ripping off Humanities Core from UCI, but I'd probably include other stuff like Said's  Covering Islam , maybe something on British imperialism in India, coffee from the near east, and orientalism in blaxploitation in movies like the  Last Dragon . Some of this kind of treads on Nick's territory though.  Anyway... I didn't get any writing done last night, since I didn't get home until pretty late. That means I should write like 4 pages or so today. I don't have any plans for today bessides to make burritos, which requires going to the market.  Oh yea... I now have the ability to play Gameboy and Gameboy Color games on my cell phone. The Nokia 3650 is simply an amazing phone. Unforunately, it has trouble handling large games like Bionic Commando, which is 2 MB. It runs Super Mario Brothers pretty decently. Nothing of course, is as great as Tetris.  I just finished a turkey sandwich, and I will be going to the grocery store in a bit.  ****

A laptop, clothes, and books being hauled from Binghamton to NJ via bus doesn't sound fun at all.  **

      Watched  Reservoir Dogs  er... more like finished it. This was the first time I've seen the ending, despite having seen the begining many times.  Wrote 2 pages for 616. 8 more to do for that particular paper.  Made a mushroom and spinach stuffed chicken breast. Not bad, but rice and a white wine sauce would have been nice. Alas I lack white wine.  Chatted with friends.  I had a little talk with Nancy, who is rather upset right now with boy troubles. I gave her a bit of advice on it, or perhaps more like blunt answers on the cruelty of life. The truth is you can't make anyone like you. This ain't the movies. If it were, I know I'd have attempted a serenade, a de Bergerac-like or high school comedy-like ploy. Since we live in reality, it's a good thing I haven't. The only thing you can do is just be yourself and live life.   I suppose I could be upset that in the past 3 years I haven't dated anyone for more than 2 weeks. Well I am somewhat annoyed that I don't like the ladies that like me, and the ladies I like don't like me back. But, then again when you've been in a long relationship before, specifically one who's duration accounts for 8% of my total life span... you're a bit more critical about things. I really don't want to settle for anyone, plus for the most part I'm rather content in that area of my life. I only make a big deal / verbalize certain things to remind myself to not be too content.   Anyway... Nancy will get over it. People usually do.  I wonder if I should watch another DVD or get writing? I promised myself to have 15 pages of writing done this weekend, and right now I have 2...  My apartment smells like sauteed mushroom... mmm...  ***

      [15086]  Reading Doctor Frank and Norman Geras's blogs probably inspired me to be a bit more intellectualy this time around on my blog. So I'm going to write something brief about some of the stuff I've been reading. This might be a good thing, because undoubtedly these are things that I'll have to write about anyway. Might as well get a head start.  The first piece is an article in  Gender & Society  by Lori Kendall on nerds and MUDs. In short it's about gender and racial issues in MUD user identities. While the article is published somewhat recently (2000), the research was done in 1995. The type of MUD that she was studying was a dying thing by 1995. I realize that article length is an issue, but she presents the MUD as more like a bland bulletin board than a more conceptual virtual space. In that sense I think that she is somewhat minimalizing the context of the interaction, which according to her title is important.  The other thing I'm reading is a book on Monterey Park by John Horton. This book is kind of very close to me personally as someone who is Taiwanese-American. Despite the attempt to explain the fact that all Chinese aren't necessarily from China, I can't help but question Horton's use of the word Chinese in the identification of people and businesses. He ends up becoming reductionist in his language. This is particularly in regards to people from Taiwan, since self-identification as Taiwanese versus Chinese is a complex and often highly political issue. Monterey Park is Little Taipei after all. I have to wonder if it is out of mere convienence to just use the word 'Chinese,' or if the people are really self-identifying themselves as Chinese. Also, this could have to with the researchers' themselves. I personally have found it difficult to explain to some non-Asians about Taiwan, because some have no idea what / where it is. It is no surprise that many Taiwanese-Americans simply call themselves Chinese even if they have native (non-KMT) origins.   I have often talked about my atypicality in regards to Asian American community. I think something that is brought up in the first chapter of Horton's book somewhat reaffirms it. I believe it was in the early 1970s that my parents immigrated to the United States, and their first stop was on the east coast. However, their experience at that time was not that of the ethnic enclave / Chinatown that many other Asian immigrants had. Following the birth of my brother and I, we moved to Artesia, CA before moving to Irvine, CA in 1984-5. As far as I know, we have never lived in a place with a high Asian population (until lots of Asians moved to Irvine in the 1990s). We didn't move to Monterey Park, which no doubt affected my identity construction and also my own concepts of "community."   In terms of my own self-identification, I don't ever remember my parents talking to me about Taiwanese politics until I was a sophmore in college. This was in large part spawned by my dating of the extremely political Rose. However, I have always called myself Taiwanese when asked about my ethnicity. It has never been because of politics, but rather it has been based on the simplistic logic that Taiwan is the geographic location of my parents' origin. Now due to my ignorance being taken away from me following my dating of Rose... who I do owe a lot to... I no longer have the bliss of ignorance. The issue of self-identification as Taiwanese-American is much more complex for me, simply because of the politics surrounding calling oneself that. I personally feel I have no right to get involved with or commentating on politics concerning a place that I have spent a miniscule amount of time in. My dad actually told me a few years ago he was proud that I called myself Taiwanese and have learned about Taiwanese history. The problem is that those merely words and the meaning behind them are much more garbled than he knows.  Yes this is a long post. Did anyone read it all?  ***

      I remember when I was growing up, I didn't like cinnamon. However, now I take in a lot of the stuff. I'm eating a cinnamon swirl bagel right now. Now I drinking apple cinnamon tea all the time, as well put cinnamon in my french toast.  Speaking of baked goods, in the library tower's coffee shop... croissants and muffins cost the same. That means I should really get muffins over croissants since they're more filling. (I only eat on campus when I really have to).

      [15079]   Reading, class, wasting time, dinner, more reading, writing, Wasting more time!  That was my day.  I need 1 or 2 more classes for next semester. I'll only take a 6 week course if I get in an independent study. I know myself too well... I can't have class only 2 days a week. I'll descend in pure laziness...   ***

      [15074]  I don't know if it's the fact that I have a late class Tuesday nights, or if it's the 6 nearly continuous hours of class on Wednesdays that make Wednesday so blah.  Some random thoughts:  Classes were ok today. I think some poor girl left her purse on the bench at the bus stop and now there's an empty purse hanging on the bench. Sometimes you see and then think things about people that bum you out. I want good seafood (so maybe I will go out of town for Thanksgiving). Food is important. I sleep too much. I need to get shit done.   ***

      It's almost 8 PM and all I've done today is chat, eat and watch  2 Fast 2 Furious . It's actually a pretty good movie. I thought the first one was just alright. I think this one benefited from Tyrese's charisma. He was just a really cool character in the movie. If they make another movie, he's gotta be in it.  I think I'm gonna go have some soup, before getting productive.  Should I read some Derrida, Durkheim, or something else from another course? Or should I write?  I should do more artwork for this site and the Traffic website maybe after I get some real work done.  Now playing some  Weakerthans ... who's name sounds like Wheat Thins... but yea, "Our Retired Explorer (Dines with Michel Foucault in Paris 1971)" is a quirky song.  Oh you're so very sweet Thank you for the flowers and the book by Derrida But I must be getting back to Dear Antartica....  ***

      [15060]  I watched  Life is Beautiful  last night. It was a great movie, despite Guido's optimism in the concentration camp starting to annoy me. It was a bummer when he died though.  Fries are in the oven right now. I'll get to work on a turkey sandwich in a bit.  Should I watch  2 Fast 2 Furious  before or after I study?  People who are reading this... put comments in the chatter box to the right! I wanna know who you are.  ***

      I managed to get a couple pages of writing done today, photocopy, find journal articles, get some Taiwanese food, and meet some nice people.   It's funny when you meet people who have your friends as TAs or as professors. Actually more like awkward when they diss 'em.  I'm gonna shower and watch a DVD and open up a beer.  ****

      So last night after class I went to go see Matrix Revolutions with the Turks. Oh man was it a let down. The action was awesome, but the story degenerated into pure stupidity. I mean the talk of love was so cheesy and sterile. There were so many logical gaps too. Oh man and the brief showing of a cross when Neo sacrificed himself was just plain stupid.  All I can say if there's any live action anime or a Superman movie... they'll have to top Neo vs Smith. That was pretty cool.  After the movie, we went to a cheap Chinese buffet... actually I've never been to a Chinese buffet that has had ghetto Americanized Chinese food.   When I got home, I chatted a bit and slipped into a food coma. 11 hrs of sleep is nice.  ***

      My review of  Streetcore . Critics everywhere rushed to review the album and nearly all gave it high praise. However, in my honest opinion those reviews were no doubt tainted by sympathy for a fallen legend.  Streetcore  is by no means a bad album; however, it falls short of the magic of  Global A Go-Go . That album was solid from top to bottom.  Streetcore , unfortunately, has a few weak tracks sandwiched between great songs. This could be due to the fact that Strummer died before the album was finalized. Songs such as “Long Shadow,” “Arms Aloft,” and “All in a Day” really don’t do much for me. Those songs are luckily sandwiched between great songs such as “Coma Girl,” “Get Down Moses,” a great cover of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song,” and “Silver and Gold” (a song that was meant to be a gift to the late Johnny Cash). All in all I see  Streetcore  as average compared to the greatness of  Global A Go-Go , but worth getting for some of the aforementioned tracks.  ***

      This is something that has really been on my mind a lot more, as I start working on helping Sam put together an Asian and Asian-American studies graduate organization. Last Friday I went to a reception for AAASP and as I talked to faculty involved in that program, there was the constant assumption that I had academic interests in things like China / Taiwan / Asian-Americans. I couldn’t help but feel extremely awkward, when those topics were brought up, because I don’t really have interests in those areas.   I have always, in true punk fashion, prided myself on not being fake and not presenting false images of who I am. This strangely enough, this was never a problem or issue when I was in California, but it seems to be more of an issue here. Is it because I’m dealing with academics?   It was just weird explaining my academic interests to someone and they asked, “What about race?” I had said that my interests are popular media and visual culture, and it was assumed that my focus would be on things such as depictions of Asian-Americans in popular media. Indeed this is something very important, and I believe my response was along the lines of, “Race is only part of what I want to study.” First of all I was an Asian in an Asian studies reception, so I can understand the assumptions, but the fact that these assumptions exist outside of this context as well… it bothers me. People ask me the same thing all the time.  Why does this bother me? It’s just so weird having people assume that based on my race, I have interests in certain issues. It’s not just non-Asian professors that have that assumption. It’s also Asian ones. I mentioned this to Steff this weekend, and her response was, “You’re the most ‘white’ person I know.” You see where the problem lies? In terms of my identity, both in regards to my own self-perception and how many people view me, there are contradictions when that arise when people assume I want to study things like China / Taiwan / Asian-Americans  I feel awkward, because my identity in many respects is very complicated. I have always been an individual first and foremost. What has always been most important to me is having my own identity that is distinct from everyone else. This contrary to stereotypes of Asian family / kinship ties or even concepts of being apart of a community. Maybe that’s why I have anarchist tendencies? I have never cared much for self-identification on ethnic / national lines. I say my ethnicity is Taiwanese, simply because that is the geographical location where my family is from. My politics on the Taiwan-China issue has always been along the lines of merely wanting the best situation for my family. I have never felt I have any right as an American born Taiwanese, to involve myself in those politics. While I never forget about my race and ethnicity, I don’t usually identify myself in those terms, unless specifically asked about my ethnicity.  On a secondary level, I based my identity more on my sub-cultural affiliations if anything at all. I’m a suburban southern Californian punk / sometimes-indie / rock guy. This identification is of course contrary to racial stereotypes. I don’t like rap and hip-hop. I don’t like Asian pop. I didn’t drive a supped up Honda. I don’t rave or club. I know in large part, this is why I feel extremely awkward when I’m involved in Asian student organizations. I dress differently and dislike the music played. It is as the same time reciprocated by people in the organizations. I’m often wearing punky clothes, which makes me stand out. When I go to Taiwanese organizations, people often don’t think I’m even Taiwanese.  Yet at the same time I’m much more in tune with my cultural heritage than many of my Asian friends or even my own brother. I can understand Mandarin with pretty good comprehension, and I can speak it conversationally. I eat the food, I know a thing or two about the history of Taiwan and also my family, and other stuff.   These are just some of the reasons why I feel extremely awkward having to take up a leadership role, along with Sam, in creating such an organization. I have always prided myself on be ‘real’ and this feels like a selling out. Should someone like me be involved in such an organization? Indeed I feel that such an organization would be beneficial to fellow students, and at the same time provide good networking for myself. It's just I don't feel that I'm being myself.  I have considered one thing though… my feelings may perhaps suggest that an interesting project could emerge out of this.   First of all issues of self-identification based on race and subculture might be cool to look at. Also in terms of a survey of issues in the academy might be interesting. Are there sort of assumptions about people that affect decisions about what they study? Is it assumed that women and homosexuals have to focus on gender issues? Do minorities have to focus on racial issues? Then at the same time do white researchers find themselves dealing with the same issues when dealing with race?  **

      Wow... you know how people talk about getting brilliant ideas in their dreams for works of art and writing? I had one of those last night. I got the idea that for studies of video games, there are observers, but not particpaters in the study of video games.  I also had some... really good dreams last night. There was a series of dreams involving this girl... very interesting not just for the nudity involved, but the whole travelling to see her thing was weird. I managed to get on a plane with a pocket knife and they were serving microwave pepperoni pizza on the plane. Oh yea and she was rolling around naked with 2 other girls.   ***

      [15009]  Some people actually recognized my Ultimate Warrior face paint last night.  Yes sometimes I have total disregard for the feelings of others, but it's merely me feeling that it's better to be honest in the giving of my opinion.  It was nice to get out. Too bad I think I purchased some cheap ass tequila which resulted in some nausea this morning.  I got a call from Esther last night and talked to Steff this afternoon. It's nice to chat with my homegirls back in SoCal.  I had breakfast for dinner - hashbrowns with onion and green bell pepper, and a spinach and mushroom omlette. I'm almost out of orange juice, which is a bummer.  I plan on making some chicken quesadillas tomorrow and chicken soup (from scratch).  Speaking of food, I read about 40 pages of Gary Fine's book on kitchens. Interesting stuff.  I watched  Empire Records  tonight too. I wanna go back to freshman year of high school and remember the tunes from that era now.  ***

      Mmm... Indie 103.1 FM... I was getting sick of listening to Flogging Molly MP3s and then I switch to some radio, and wouldn't you know it... Flogging Molly was playing. Now It's the Clash at least.  Everytime I read Doctor Frank of the Mr. T Experience's blog, I get inspired to write something more thoughtful than the mere recounting of my daily life. Well... Frank and Norman Geras referred to David Aaronovitch's article in the Guardian about the quakes in Iran and California. I think it draws on the tensions of modernity & capitalist development. It is assumed that the trajectory of history is one of ever improving human conditions. This is in stark contrast to the backward conservatism of fundamentalist Iran. Indeed modern capitalism has aided in creating quake proof buildings that saves lives; however, at the same time the evils of capitalism sparked anti-globalization and correspondingly anti-western attitudes that keep corporations with "modern" building technologies out. These countries like Iran are to a certain extent right about the corruption and decadence of western capitalism, but their turning their back on the west cost them 300,000 lives. I guess a question that can be pulled from the article is whether or not a balance in capitalism can be found. Does capitalism necessarily have to exploitative? Can we have a system of global capital accumulation that isn't purely based on the bottom line?  The radio is playing X now.  Anyway... high capitalism or postmodernity has yet to really address that question. Indeed there is an increased focus on the concerns of individuals, human rights, etc. today, but the logic of capitalism still includes exploitation in this stage of capitalism. Corporations feign being green and don't really care about the environment or the people any more than they did before. The focus is still on the rights of core countries.  I don't know where I'm going with all this, but the world is more complex than a lot of people argue.   ***

Indeed it might be satire, but having that sort of depiction of race on a channel were most viewers are retards is just scary. I really hope what they showed on TV isn't the only thing that he raps about, because if it is then he's part of the problem of misrepresentation. Anyway it's late and I'm not gonna go into a super long rant about how annoying what I saw was.  It's Xmas and I'm listening to Joe Strummer.  ***

I'm not a drunk, fucked up, gay, handicapped, etc.  I downloaded KQ2... I'll play that later.  Then I watched most of  Pirates of the Carribbean . I really like the movie and all, but it's about 20 minutes too long. I started dozing during the DVD around the same place that I got bored in the theater... the part where Johnny Depp and the chick get dumped on the island. I still think that movie ripped off elements of Monkey Island.  I'm bored.  **

I mailed my paper, watched  Dark City , and  The Last Dragon , and ate nuggets and taquitos today.   Dark City  was cool. Jennifer Connelly movies are usually enjoyable, not because she's hot (even though she is), but because they are usually cool. Like Rockeeter, Hulk, Requiem for a Dream, and a Beautiful Mind. The movie came out a year before the first Matrix movie and has a lot of similiarities.   The Last Dragon  is cheesy as hell, but funny.  I feel better today, despite the sniffling.  **

My mp3s on this computer sound excellent.  Should I get a tv tuner or a new mp3 cd player for myself? I'm so materialistic.  I'm amused by how anime Teen Titans is. Robin anime-style is amusing.

A great live album.  So today... I woke up around 9 AM chatted with Melissa and posted stuff on message boards about the greatness of the Chronicles of Narnia in comparison to the Lord of Rings. Then I had lunch and slept for a couple hours.  I need to write 4 more pages, proof read and mail my paper to Benita by 11 AM tomorrow. Argh... I hate being sick. I've been pretty physically inactive for the past few days. I sleep well over 12 hrs a day, and I can feel my muscles atrophy.

       Bad Religion 's  Recipe for Hate  really is brilliant. It came out in 1993 and 10 years later the lyrics are still relavent. It's like that article on Ink19.com I read many months ago explained.  You know we live in a pretty screwed up world. So the death toll in post-war Iraq is up to 200+, we have Saddam captured, Michael Jackson is formally charged with child molestation, there are continued tensions between China and Taiwan, kids continue to be exploited in factories, etc. There's all that shit going on in the world and at the same time most of us are more concerned with our daily human emotions such as loneliness, desire, anger, sorrow, lust and hate. It's like you wonder if the micro level alienation and anomie reflects how on the global level our species gets more and more stupid. If we can't even take care of our day to day lives, how are we able to end world hunger, the AIDS pandemic, and have peace?   I recommend all of you listen to  Bad Religion 's "American Jesus."  I really think that if I hadn't started listening to Bad Religion in 1993-1994, my freshman year of high school, I wouldn't have ended up in sociology.   ***

      [15342]  I've just been watching Saturday Morning Cartoons for the first time in a while. There are a lot of "Asian" themed cartoons these days. I don't know if they're good or bad, since they really stereotype Asians.   Hmm... so what did I do yesterday? Not a lot actually. I lounged around and read some Braudel. I also did some chatting with my mom and let her know how school is coming along.  Right now I'm trying to listen to my  Bad Religion  CDs in order. I'm in 1991 right now. It's funny how music really takes you back to different points in your life.  I didn't really sleep well last night. My lungs felt congested.  I need to call Cissa later to see if she still wants to go to the boardie meet up in Pasadena.  ***

      I got home last night from watching LOTR with Steff and her work friends. It was a good movie, but I'm going to go on a little rant right now.  Roger Ebert was right about the flatness of the story and characters this time around. Indeed the characters are technically supposed to span the whole series; however, none of the characters bessides maybe the hobbits Pippin and Merry show any real flair or depth. Sam and Frodo were really annoying the fuck out of me. I'll just come out and say it... Sam is a wiener and he probably wants Frodo to... well... see his wiener. I'm not even sure why they included the stuff on Arwen. Her role in the movie was pretty pointless, because Aragorn was so flat as a character. He would have been much cooler if they did more on his identity as a ranger versus his identity as a king. Give him conflict like Smeagol / Gollum had in the 2nd movie. Gimli was a character that had personality, but no air time to show it off.  I personally think that the Lord of the Rings' greatness lies in the overall narrative, not the specific details. It's a good story with great special effects. I think the battle in the 3rd movie had a bit more tension than in the 2nd one. I think that of similar battles... the one in  The Empire Strikes Back , which they kind of rip off is better.  Anyway... that movie is more of a B+ / A- movie for me. It didn't reek of WOW like other movies I've seen.  Ok... so I just had breakfast and lunch combined in a 2 hr span of time while watching  I Love Lucy ,  A Team , VH1, and infomercials.  I should go out and enjoy sunshine today.  ****

      [15333]  Leave comments on my Flooble thing people!!!  Today was productive. I read about 65 pages of  The Mediterranean  by Fernand Braudel. So far, I’m just reading about the terrain in the Mediterranean and how it relates to the people. It’s great stuff.  I got an A in 572E! I want to get Tom’s comments on my paper.  I also did a tiny bit of writing today. I want to mail my papers to Benita on Monday.  I got a call around 8 AM from a university phone number, and when I called back it was no answer. I wonder who called me.  I’m going to see LOTR with Steff tonight.  ****

      Well yesterday I spent most of the day recovering from the jet lag and 6:05 AM flight. When I got home I had some Carl's Jr., chatted online, picked up some stuff at Sav-On, napped, went out to eat with the family, watched TV, and then went to BJs.   Another reason why the West Coast is better than the East Coast: Fresher seafood.  It was cool hanging out with Alex, Jon and Brandon at BJs.  So today... either I'll just lounge around all day, read, write or sit around on the computer. I'll probably hang out with Steff later this afternoon.  ****

      I'm feuding with New Yorkers over the greatness of the Californian empire: [10:30:59 AM] ME: so when I take off in my plane [10:31:05 AM] ME: I'm gonna flip off the state of NY [10:31:06 AM] ME: haha [10:31:13 AM] Nancy: Then you'll get killed by [10:31:13 AM] Nancy: me.  [11:12:37 AM] ME: we have the governator [11:12:41 AM] Melissa: that's not something to be proud of! [11:12:45 AM] ME: more style than pataki [11:12:55 AM] Melissa: hey, pataki has plenty of style [11:13:04 AM] ME: Arnold can beat him up Did I mention California is the greatest state?  Reasons why Califoria is greater than New York:  Music and Cities: Los Angeles: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Bad Religion, Ozma, Sublime, Descendents, X, Germs, Cramps, Circle Jerks, Dead Kennedys, Face to Face, Manic Hispanic  Orange County: Guttermouth, Offspring, Thrice, Ignite, The Vandals, No Doubt, Lit, TSOL, Adolescents, Agent Orange, Social Distortion, Mad Cap, Rage Against the Machine  San Francisco: Rancid, Green Day, One Man Army, Mr. T Experience Better weather, more varied topography, bigger state, and most importantly I'm from California.  ***

      5 hrs of presentations and the real professor wasn't even there!!!  Before that I went to campus to mail stuff and get money. Then I did some paper editting and helped Inhye with her paper. Then it was 5 hrs of presentations. I'm sort of annoyed that certain people totally took advantage of the situation and talked over the alotted 15 minutes. I think that's just totally disrespectful to your classmates, because other people have to speak and people want to get home at a reasonably time. One guy talked for 30 minutes. That was just absurd.  After the presentation SeoKyung, Inhye, Shriya and I went to Olive Garden for dinner and then we hung out at my place drinking vodka. It was cool sitting around chatting / gossiping about school stuff.  I just did some packing. Tomorrow I need to go to the post office, campus, and clean. I got invited to go to the art history party. It's funny how involved in the art history department I am.  ***

      I'm such a dumbass.... I overwrote a paper file with an older version of it. There went 1 page of writing.  There has been one blunder after the another this weekend. Thankfully it's over!!!  It's funny Esther just gave me the same advice I gave her... take a day / night off. I can't do that until I get home... unfortunately.   BTW I'm scared to death of problems getting home due to snow.   Hopefully I can get some money tomorrow and buy beverages.  *

      [15318]  Something I was thinking about is how  The Wiz  (1978) uses the context of New York in the retelling of  The Wizard of Oz , which was allegorical to the Great Depression. The  The Wiz , being full of African-American pop icons in a dystopic New York has to have some sort of complex message to be said. Maybe I’ll give it another watch before returning it.  So my ATM did get cancelled. Bleh… I need to go to campus and try to get cash using my checks.  I wonder if my professor will be able to make it school in this kind of weather. He lives in Ithaca, which is a long drive in this kind of weather.  I need to finish editing my paper and prepare for my presentation tomorrow. Just a little more.  Almost back in Irvine!!!  **

      I feel lazy and I feel weird that I feel weird being without my credit cards. Damn cancelling them. I wonder if my ATM still works?  I did a tiny bit of revisiing yesterday... not enough though.  I watched  Secretary  last night. That was one trippy movie. I really enjoyed it, because despite the weirdness of the characters... they were interesting. You wanted Lee and Mr. Grey to get together despite their really weird relationship. Also that Peter guy looks like Corey Feldman.  It's snowing like crazy right now... I wonder if I should see if my ATM still works and go to Burger King.  **

      Nevermind   I found my wallet lying on the floor of my apartment. This is so weird... I wasn't that drunk... I only had 7 pints.  I paid for the beer at the bar then walked off to the bus stop... I patted my pocket and realized I couldn't find my wallet. I checked ALL my pockets and it was no where to be found!  Then next think I know... I get out of the shower and see my wallet lying on the floor of my apartment.   WTF! this is so weird.   *

      Hah.. so I mentioned the Caroyln Ellis article in my post yesterday. Today in class, Utku said that we shouldn't mind Foucault's ego in his interviews, because we can still learn a lot from them. The funny thing is that yesterday he tore the Ellis piece apart due to her ego. I mentioned this to Utku and he laughed.  Another academic irony is that I saw a link to a "What kind of postmodernist are you?"   urlLink quiz   on Crystal's blog. I took it and it said that I'm a theory slut. Haha... I think I am much more theoretical than empirical. That's probably why I'm a sociologist and not a historian; however, I still have a stronger affinity to history than sociology.  I'm gonna pay the Ale House a visit later.  ***

      I have a good chunk of my past / life documented on here. About 2 years worth.  I distinguish the difference between my past and life as being the events in my life (past) and the essence of the total living learning organism of Albert (life). The living organism of Albert going through past posts remembers a lot when going through his past.  There's a handful of 'invisible' people who read this blog, and I wonder what they think of me as represented only by this blog. You could be someone that I've known for years, or someone whom I'm only known for a small amount of time... however I wonder how reading this blog affects your understanding of me.  I know when I read blogs of other people, some are written in a 'voice' similar to how they really speak in real life. The stories they tell in their blogs are stories they have no problem telling someone in reality. However, some are more open online and some are less. I'm not sure where I lie in that spectrum. I say a lot of things here, that I don't normally tell people. However, a lot of that has to do with there hasn't been someone whom I've shared my thoughts freely with for a while. But on the other hand, there's a lot of stuff that I choose not to completely disclose on here. This is partially because literally anyone can access this page. I don't know who is really reading this and how it might affect them.  The reason why I'm thinking about this is because in 616 we read an ethnography article by Carolyn Ellis on the rammifcations of authorship and audience in regards to people you know.    I can be a pretty blunt and forward individual. If someone asks me something I try to give honest answers and opinions. If I have something to say to someone, then I say it.   That being said... I want people to know that if they have comments or questions about or for me... tell me. This is part of life... living and learning, and a major part of that is the interaction between self and others. Discourse is a good thing.  ***

      I just found old blogs html files from previous places I've blogged. They are the 2 archive files for 2001 that I just uploaded.  To fill in the gaps for you all in case you want to look at my life in 2001... it starts in March of 2001, when I first started blogging on Asian Avenue. Prior to that... well... I believe March of 2001 was when I first started working regular hours at Nielsen. Prior to that I had a month of idleness due to being laid off at Deposit Saver. That February was a really shitty month for me for so many reasons. I won't go into it here.  So I have entries from March to May. Late June to early August is when I was in Europe. Then I stopped blogging for a while since a certain person who I hate with a passion got pissed off about my blog entries. Long story, but I'm sure that if you know me, then you know about the person I hate with a passion. However, at that time we were still friends... so I stopped posting for a while. Then I started posting again in late November infrequently until I started using blogger.com in February 2002.  ***

      [15290]  My burrito is sitting next to me right now, because it's too hot to eat at this very moment.  I'm listening to the new  Offspring  album  Splinter . It's alright. There are some tracks that I like, some that I don't. To rate their albums I'd go in this order:  Smash (1994) Americana (1998) Ignition (1992) Ixnay on the Hombre (1997) Conspiracy of One (2000) Splinter (2003) At least that's the order for now.  I feel old when I think about how it's already been almost 10 years since  Smash  came out.  The semester is creeping to an end... today was the last class for 616. That class was pretty fun... 572F was fun too. I think those were my favorite classes this semester. Taking 16 units was totally worth it this semester. The work wasn't as obscenely hard as people make 16 units seem to be.  I learned a lot and it forced me to be on task and get shit done. I still don't know what to do for next semester.  I'm amused by the song, "Spare me the Details" from  Splinter  that's playing right now. I know that's probably not a song that Brandon would dig. He doesn't dig Offspring's pop songs, and this song is a lot like "Why Don't You Get A Job."  I'm gonna make another burrito... but yea... I'm running low on food. I don't know if that's good or bad. I only have 6 days left here in Binghamton and I'll probably go out to eat a few times before I leave. Maybe I'll buy some frozen / instant food this weekend.  ***

Very fucking funny when people on dialup (like me) download them. Of the real songs I've downloaded, nothing mind blowing has been downloaded yet. At least it's nothing as bad as  Rancid 's piece of crap  Indestructible .  Now on to another topic...  I was talking to Melissa earlier about individualism versus the masses of humanity. I thought my little spiel would be worth putting here. So basically I think humanity, if it weren't for the greatness of individuals, would pretty much be a plague on this planet. We've fucked so much stuff up.  En masse ... humanity is really dumb, war, corporations, slavery, screwing with the environment and really dumb popular culture trends. (This is the cheerful stuff I study in sociology). If it weren't for the coolness of certain people near and dear to me, and the brave / courageous / kind / generous actions of individuals around the world... then I'd say humanity should be wiped out.  Oh yea... and Melissa said she was watching  Ozma 's "Domino Effect" video. That makes me wonder when the  Vandals ' DVD will come out... in hopes that once again I will appear on the screen thanks to Kung Fu Records. Joe Escalante did promise to make me famous. If humanity is going to be wiped out, at least there will be images of me on film for alien archaelogists to find.  Is it just me or does the song title "Long Way Home" sound so typically SoCal punk? I could so see  Pennywise  doing a song by that name.  ***

      "Flossing a Dead Horse" by  NOFX  is playing right now.  That song put me in a happy mood and made me think about all the potential live music for this winter break. The power of music is something Esther and I talk about from time to time. She's one of the few people I know that really "get it" when it comes to all the things you feel when you're down on the floor at a show. We've talked about how it's just such a great escape from the chore of daily life. It's like you feel invincible, you feel brotherhood (at some punk shows), feel anger, joy, and a connection to a social whole. I can't wait to see  Flogging Molly  in January. I plan on drinking the flask of whisky that my cousin Kelly gave me and dancing to fine sounds of Irish punk... you don't hear me say I wanna dance often do you?  I'm in a writing mood right now, but not in an academic writing mood. So I'll muse about a few more things...  I wonder what me and the boys will do for New Years this year. It's been a while since the whole  posse  has been together partying and living it up. Kaho didn't make Vegas in July and that was a damn shame, because that was perhaps THE MOST FUCKING AMAZING WEEKEND EVER!  Now playing  Guttermouth 's "She's Got the Look"  So in a week I'll have a masters degree in sociology and from there I'll be working on my doctorate. At 23 years of age, I believe I'm still the youngest person in my department. In theory, I could be done with my phd at 28... wow...   ***

There were also some weird stuff like in there like sneaking into a military installation, using a weird bathroom, get stuck with a needle, etc.  Also I need to stop having NPR be my wakeup on my clock radio... my sense of reality is really blurred when I'm just waking up.

Then I returned  Ferris Bueller , did my laundry, mailed stuff on campus, and got some writing done.  Man I had a large dinner...

Then I had some of the Koreans over at my place for some vodka.

      [15249]  So last night I had dinner with Melissa. Then we watched  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  and  South Park . It was a nice evening. I had fun, because she's cool.   I hadn't watched  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  in years... it's such a classic.  Today I lounged around for a long time, before finally going to campus to get work done. I returned a couple of books and then did some editting on my  Planet of the Apes  paper. It's getting closer to where I'm satisfied with it. The end just needs a bit more work.   I did some editing on my methods paper also. I didn't bring any readings with me, but I think I'll conclude it with something from Alford on rigor to finish it off when I get home.

Inhye offered a ride so I guess that makes it more worth my while to go to. Otherwise, I was going to stay home and watch  Gone in 60 Seconds  and  Roman Holiday  (a classic that I've never seen). I think instead I'll watch just one of the movies with my dinner and watch the other tomorrow.  ***

      My cookies always get good reviews and people always ask how I manage to get the texture / chewiness in them.  I always feel like my cookies aren't to that special of a level... I think I need to refine the recipe I have.  Perhaps I should try shortening instead of butter next time... I think lowering the temperature of the oven from 375 to 350 allows for better shape. I think the foil sheet works better than the metal one as well.  Just some thoughts...  ***

This weekend I plan on getting 2 papers completed, polished, and ready to turn in early in the week.  I did my presentation on the  Planet of the Apes  and I guess it was well received. I think that was the best presentation that I've done in a while... but I'm never satisfied with my work. Tom said that what I talk about in the end of my paper was really interesting. It was the idea of the built environment not being merely used for the film, but it is an actor in the narrative of history. This in many ways reflects a circular relationship in all cultural 'actors' in the late 1960s and 1970s. I think I would expand on that circular movement and say that the narrative of the  Planet of the Apes  further parallels the built environment in how the laying fallow of 'ghettos' later resulted in gentrification.  I plan on polishing up that paper this weekend so it's ready by Wednesday.  Oh yea I had gyoza / potstickers with Tami and Wataru... that shit rocks.  Tomorrow I've got errands to run and I get to make dinner for someone.  ***

      [15681]  Listening to some  Duran Duran  right now... "Last Chance"  My external drive kit is acting up again. It's pissing me off and it's making me tempted to buy a real external drive.  Let's see... today so far I've done some cleaning, had a bagel, balanced my check book, picked up readings at school, skimmed through the readings, had a chicken sandwich, craved English muffins, watched  That Thing You Do  and played around with photoshop - not necessarily in that order.  Listening to some  Great White  right now... "Once Bitten Twice Shy"  I ran into some on campus that I don't like running into. He's the only person in Binghamton that I really dislike. There's weird people on campus for sure, but those weird folks are nice. This guy has an underlying assholeness beneath his fake niceness. He's just plain fucked up. It's not so much talking shit that he does, but he tries to turn you against people. He also thinks he's a do-gooder and says he tries to help others. He's a loser. I think he's a load of crap and I wish he wouldn't talk to me at all. He's someone who I'd beat up if given the right reason.   Listening to some  Propagandhi  right now... "Ska Sucks"  I need to go over the 2 articles for Kusno's class again tonight, then tomorrow I need to go through the Crosby book and article for Lee's class. Yay 240 pages!  **

      [15678]  For all you Californians who are interested what it's like to be me and waiting for the bus here in Binghamton...  urlLink check this out .  I lost my photocopies of some readings for Monday, that means I have to get my ass to campus today.  I watched  League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  last night. It wasn't as bad as Ebert said, but it has some problems. For example, they never explained why the vampire chick could walk around in the day time.   Now playing some  Bad Religion .  **

      [15675]  Binghamton is home to lots of weird people. Whether it's locals or students... lots of weird people.  Here's a story about one such person from last night. There was this drunken redneck looking guy with a cowboy hat and leather jacket at the Belmar last night. As trashy as he looked he was kind of funny to talk to. He was talking about how we don't own the land and we are really its caretakers. Then he talked about all the stuff he's learned from a 4 ft kung fu master, and Native Americans. He was barely coherent, but he was hilarious. I seem to communicate well drunks well.  Oh yea... Melanie kept complaining that the place reeked of vomit. I told her that's a sign of a good bar.  ***

      [15669]   So yesterday I got up at 7 and was on campus around 8:30 to scan some stuff.  urlLink Photos  have been uploaded. Then I had a somewhat interesting, but very crowded and clausterphobic class. After school I picked up my TV tuner from the apartment office and set it up. However, the attenna I got from Radio Shack only allows me to get ABC... which sucks. The only station I really wanted was FOX. So I had to order cable and I need to return the attenna.  Last night I went out to eat with Wataru, Tami, and Chi-Wei at the Texas Roadhouse. It was good and the price wasn't bad. I think we should go there instead of the overpriced Hooters from now on... although Wataru is going back to Japan, so I don't know who will be going next time.  Afterwards, I got dropped off at my place and watched  Escape from LA . I thought it was better than  Escape from NY . I really do! And that's not just to annoying Nancy and Melissa...  LA  is just more fun!  Then Inhye and I went to the Belmar and did some drinking there. It was cool. Saw Wataru again there, along with Melanie and Kristina (in addition to all the usual grad students). Afterwards we chilled at my place until pretty late (early).  A little ramble about stuff...   I honestly don't know what I want in life right now. I just still feel unsatisfied with so much. It's a little bit better with work to do and the fact I've been working out... but... I dunno... I'm missing a lot of the things that make me who I am here. Maybe that  Pennywise  show in a few weeks will cheer me up?  Other randomness... 4:30 AM is not a peak hour for coordination of mental and physical activities.... ABC sucks... 5 hrs of sleep suck... lack of practice of any activity sucks...  ***

      [15653]  "not allowed ... dinner time seinfeld, simpsons, so-called life seen the reruns 20 million times" -  Descendents ' "Nothing With You"  I had to fix my order on Amazon due to a credit card problem, and was tempted to add  urlLink this  to my order. I ordered a TV tuner and USB hub in addition to some books. If only  urlLink Bemused  supported WinTV stuff. Then I'd have a remote!!!  So the Bush Administration is finally starting to admit that there aren't any WMD to be found in Iraq. Prior to the war numerous sources were saying that Iraq did not have the capacity to be building WMD following the first Gulf War. It's absolutely ridiculous how right wing people still think that Bush did the right thing saying that we still got Saddam. Are those people who lost children, brothers, sisters, family in the war? I'm talking about the rising body count for both Americans and Iraqis. I hope Bush doesn't win the election; however, I don't have a lot of faith in American voters.   Now playing:  1208 's 1988  Oh yea it's insane! The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) in UPW! They're facing Tom Howard and a mystery opponent with Joe Millionaire as special referee! I wish I could go see it!  Stuff to do today:  photocopy stuff pick up picture read stuff check out books maybe go buy groceries   ***

      [15608]   Remember:  Ask questions about me in the box to the right and I shall answer here.   Those squats last night made my legs sore. It didn't help that I went up and down the stairs in the Library Tower a few times... nor does the fact I live upstairs.  I'm also extremely tired since I went to sleep at about 4 AM.    Q1  Laine: Name your biggest regret in life.  Answer: I think that I regret a lot less in life now than I did when I was younger. I tend to act more immediately than when I was in high school or even my early years in college. I'm also significantly more open and vocal about my own life and feelings. I don't really hide much. If there is one thing I really regret is hurting people I care about. Guilt is the most painful form of regret.   Next question!  ***

The Descendents fucking rule. I can't wait for their next full length to come out.  I worked out a bit today, my legs are feeling a bit wobbly from the squats. It's nice to actually do something productive for a change.  Today was a social day. Lots of talking and hanging out with friends.   Things to do tomorrow: 2 classes, pick up financial aid check, mail Netflix stuff, maybe grocery shop, and do write up.  I'm really looking forward to the upcoming week. Stuff to do! No more feeling like I'm endlessly adrift in nothingness. Hopefully the feeling of dissatisfaction will go away.   It's interesting though... my feelings are definately the result of my social conditioning. In other cultures and places where the pace of life is slower, this would be so bad for them. However, in our hyper-capitalist society productivity is important. Fuck that...   ***

      [15594]  Fuck my screwed up sleep habits, fuck 5 day weekends, fuck lack of a TV!  This would have been cool if I didn't spend the past month doing jack shit already. I'm getty antsy!  My goal for this semester is to be more active. Quite frankly, I haven't really been happy with my life here in Binghamton. It hasn't been miserable or anything, but it lacks excitement... it lacks debauchery... it lacks great live music... it lacks violence. The lack of structure as well as a lot of things in my life here, causes for an imbalance in everything. I think insomnia, slacking in school work, unhealthy behavior, is all derivative of the lack of order in my life. I need structure and goals.  I remember there was a point in my life that was busy, productive and happy. I was extremely busy coaching, working and going to school. I was doing things that I liked doing such as going to shows. It was great. I was also surrounded by good friends and went to fun shows.  Alas I need something to fill my 5 free days.  I should work out, do artwork, and study more.  ***

So today Melissa and I went to get stuff for our turkey feast Friday night. We got most of the stuff at Walmart; however, Walmart was out of injectors. We tried looking for one at Giant and Target, which required a lot of walking. It also wasn't cool waiting in the cold for the bus.   I miss TV! I want to watch the OC!  ***

      [15565]  The coffee in my cup is weak. I wish it was as strong as good Ethiopian coffee.  I need to do some cleaning today.  Yea so I feel different in Binghamton. I think it's partly due to the environment. Hilly river valley inland, versus Pacific coast. There's also just a different vibe here. Everything in California is so much more vibrant and alive. That makes me feel more energetic and crazy. Here even when it's not snowing, it just doesn't have that feeling. It's also that here I don't get the chance to be crazy. Everything is just so neutral here.   The  Short Music for Short People  compilation always reminds me of Summer of 1999.   Ok time for breakfast.  ***

I simply didn't know all the new songs, because I hadn't bought the new CD yet. However, I got to talk to Frank briefly and buy their new CD. It was an alright show overall. Brandon and I then had some Del Taco and beer.  I didn't get to sleep until like 2 and I left for LAX at 4:30 to beat traffic. I had a 7:15 flight from LA to Pittsburgh, which left me stuck sitting next to a fidgety fat kid.  Inhye picked me up at the airport and we went to IHOP for dinner. Then I asked her for some grocery shopping help.  And here I am... back in my apartment.  ***

      [15552]  I decided to go over some of the stuff from my religious studies courses. I am by no means an expert, but here are some of my thoughts on the development of Christianity. So in 325 CE, there was the Council of Nicaea which affirmed the 4 gospels that most people read today. The point of having those specific 4 was the Catholic Church's goal of defining Jesus's position in the order of things, because there was debate over how divine he was and his relationship with God. This is why John is so important to most Christians today. The them versus us stuff in that document where they single out Jews is part of it. It is to define orthodoxy in the religion. This orthodoxing persists into today. In the 13th century, Franciscan friar, William of Rubruck journeyed to the Mongol empire on behalf of Louis IX. There he came across other Christian sects such as the Nestorians. He actually denies that they are really Christians, because they argued for a duel nature in Christ. Nicaea had said he was fully divine. Then in the early 16th century there was the Reformation and various wars over religion. However, in the West and the places that it conquered their sense of Christ's divinity was still based on the full divinity that is most visible in the gospel of John. However this stuff is pretty fucked up in that it's a theology that comes from a guy that never met Jesus and was writing 70 years after is death far away from Palestine. He targeted Jews because he was not of the original Christians who were Jews themselves. That document would later be used to justify things like the Holocaust.   I really wonder if this stuff is ever explained to people who go to church, because it sure doesn't seem like it.   Someone once said that my obssession with understanding religions makes me religious in my own way. However, I don't use this knowledge to guide my life. I'm generally a nihilist in that I don't believe in objectivity.  ***

      [15551]  A long ass day. I was up at 7 AM, because I was driving my parents and myself to my cousin Irene's wedding in San Diego. It was nice. Afterwards, we went to a Chinese restaurant for lunch. Then we hung out at my aunt's place in Carlsbad. From there some of us cousins went to a bonfire in La Jolla before I finally went home.  It was cool seeing my cousins, who I haven't seen in years. I don't really have many memories of them, because I was so young when I last saw them. I collected their emails and sent out a mass email to all the cousins I have emails for. It's like a Friendser thing for the Fu family. Speaking of which... I should see if any are on friendster.  My brother and I were talking the whole "wedding thing" at the reception at the restaurant. We said that we wouldn't go out of our way to tell embarassing stories about one another at our respective weddings. However, aunt Vivian and Irene said that they have plenty of stories of me to tell when I get married! If the whole marriage thing isn't scary enough, I know my friends and family have a lot of dirt on me. Shit!  Something that is really weird for me is that out of the 2 cousin weddings I've attended, is that those cousins are pretty religious. It's weird for someone like me, who is extremely critical of organized religion. It was awkward for me to hear excerpts from John, for example, because out of all the gospels... that is the most ahistorical and anti-semitic of the gospels. Esther and I were talking about how sexist the gospels can be the other night, and this is a somewhat similar example of how messed up the people who put the Bible together are. Out of the countless documents floating around they chose one that was written well past 100 AD (thus not a primary document) and is anti-semitic. What bothers me more is that 1900 years later, people read that stuff and believe it is the word of God.  I am happy for my cousin though. I guess I owe my literacy to her and her sister. I was telling my brother at the wedding that we inherited our little golden books from them.  Back to Binghamton on Monday. I'll be catching MTX tomorrow with Cissa probably.   ***

      [15545]  Now playing: the Smithereens - Behind the Wall of Sleep  Picard is fucking bad ass. He's brilliant, eloquent, can fight, and gets a lot of pussy. Sure my man Da Shat... Captain Kirk got more pussy than Picard. He got green, blue, and every other color possibly pussy; however, he didn't have the style Picard did. Picard used his brain as much as his big fucking phaser rifle to kick ass.  I stand by Cisco as my favorite. He was literally a god to a fucking planet and he punched Q.  Why can't we have a president like Picard? I'd vote for him.  Now playing: the Darkness - I Believe in A Thing Called Love  Wedding tomorrow. That means I have to get my ass up in the morning, look nice, and drive to San Diego. The food better be fucking good.  By the way it's just a coincidence that the song playing has to do with love and I'm talking about this happy lovey stuff.  This is sort of a silly thought based on something my mom said a while ago during this winter break... "I don't think you're getting married any time soon." I don't know what she means by that. I honestly have no idea where I'm going to end up in 4-5 years. I really don't have a clue about aspects of my life that I can actually control like work and fun... much less something as random and incontrollable like a relationship.  A lot of the reminicing my friends and I have been doing, plus the few drives up to LA sort of made me wonder how my own life will turn out. "Que sera sera... what will be will be..." but "what will it be like when I get old" (some song lyrics for y'all). I'll hopefully have my phd by age 28. Then what? Will I still be getting down in the pit? Where will I live? Where will I work? Will I still be a crazy drunk? Will I be tied down by that point?  Now Playing: NOFX - Franco Un-American  Oh well whatever... I'll just have my beer and watch history unfold.  ***

      [15532]  There have been some debates in various places on Bush wanting to send people to the moon and Mars.  I remember before the war even started that I had commented that Bush is probably thinking he can recreate the post WWII economic prosperty via growth in military spending. Space exploration research is totally a part of military spending. Let's not forget that things like rockets and satellites lead to the development of ICBMs. I think that Bush really does believe that development in this sector will not only increase the country's economic might, but military might.  I really don't want us to be building bigger and better bombs when inner city schools suffer. The whole trickle down theory is total bullshit. It's never worked in the past, and it is unlikely it ever will. Yet I can't help but think of all the cool things I have as a result of space shuttle research. Computers, plastics, and cell phones are pretty neat things to have. Yet it is an intensification of capitalism in which we will be sucked further into the system... or in the case of the poor... excluded?  ***

      [15503]  Post comments people!   I can't wait to go back to school. A one month break of living at home after having your own place for 1.5 years is such a bitch. My parents are getting on my nerves because of their bitching about me being a lazy ass and going out a lot. I'm all like what the fuck... as an undergrad I paid my own way through most of school and got good grades. I should revoke their bragging rights when I get my fucking phd if they keep this up.  I swear my parents are such squares. First off they have no concept of growth in character. My mom is too busy worrying about every little detail to have fun. She's always stressing, worrying, spazzing out, etc. She's so caught in her little world of worry that her sense of the bigger picture of life isn't that wide. She nitpicks about saving money by buying stuff on sale, even when we don't eat it and then it goes bad thus wasting more money in the long run than if you just bought it for 40 cents more when you do want it. She buys crappy cheap clothes and expects me or my brother to wear it? When no one wears it, it's more money wasted. She has no concept of being a well rounded person. Neither does my dad who's careless and lost in his own little world of guilty pleasures. He's extremely lazy, ignorant of the world, and careless. He just wants to have fun and have life as easy as possible. They're complete opposites and as a result argue a lot. As much as I care about my parents they're really the cause of their own suffering. Then when they're suffering they take it out on myself or my brother.  They need to learn how to live a balanced life. For all the Buddhist stuff that my mom tries to get into, she isn't very chill. She stresses herself so much and that's why she gets sick. That's not to saying worrying is bad, but not to the level she is. Then my dad is too careless. He just doesn't want to deal with anything and he lacks responsibility.   They simply don't get a lot of things. Not to sound full of myself and hyperbolize my life, but a lot of people have been wowed by my adventures, life experiences, and knowledge of the world. That shit doesn't come from a fucking book. It comes from going out in the world and experiencing as much as possible. I'm a fucking sociologist. I study society and that means I have to go out and experience it. Take my recent urban sociology papers. How the fuck am I supposed to write about LA if I've never been there? When I write about popular culture, how the fuck am I supposed to write about it if I haven't gone to concerts, hit the bars, and experience it first hand!? I'm 23 and I've seen more in my life in the past few years than my parents have in decades.  It's stupid. If they're bragging about me to their friends, then they should back the fuck off and let me be me. It's not like they've given me much guidance growing up. I fucking learned how to cook mostly on my own, from experimenting after school. I fucking did my own shit for school, if anything their meddling only hurt whatever I was doing on my own. I remember how in kindergarden, they had no clue what the hell was going on and I had to learn a lot of shit on my own. Lots of cultural stuff and social skills I fucking learned on my own. Stuff like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. I had no idea about so much stuff. If I was brought up with the cultural capital that other kids had I would have accelled so much more in school. I also wouldn't have been the social outcast I was.  Another thing that pisses me off is the whole playing violin thing. First they didn't let me play the instruments I wanted. I wanted to play a brass instrument. Second, they were all like saying that the free music lessons at school and self practice were enough to be a good violinist. I wanted private lessons, but they wouldn't take me in for private lessons until it was too late. I fell behind and I had no firm grounding in basic skills. By the time I had private lessons I was a lost cause.  Then for wrestling I worked my ass of to be a league champ without any parental support. It really depressed me when I saw how other wrestlers got support from their parents when I didn't. I didn't get rides to freestyle tournaments. I didn't get a chance to go to camps and clinics. It makes me angry at them when I think about the success I could have had if I had support from them. They never even went to any of my real matches.  There's so many things I could have been with some encouraging. I could have been a better violinist, I could have been a better artist, I could have placed in CIF.   I don't remember them saying very many encouraging things to me when I was growing up. They did say nice things, but all they mainly criticized me. They'd always compare to me cousins or their friends' kids. It was always focusing on the bad and never the good. It's no wonder I'm an asshole and generally angry at society.   I know a lot of this isn't their fault. They're immigrants and I was their first born American child. However, for them to criticize me for bullshit stuff and then take credit for my success by bragging about me is annoying to me.  I just feel frustrated in that when I'm in CA, I feel more free to do go out and do stuff. In Binghamton I feel restricted to a limited set of activities. Here I can pretty much do whatever the fuck I want. Binghamton is nice cause of the relaxation and focus on brainy stuff. However, I always feel restless towards the end of the semester. CA is the place where I let go and can be the insane self that is more tame in grad school.   Anyway tonight Julia, Steff, Cissa, Abby, Janet, Dan and that Turkish guy went out to eat. It was fun. My friends are so cool. I also took the girls neutral car racing on Ridgeline. They loved it.  ***

      [15496]  I'm going to have some Ethiopian with Julia, Steff, Cissa, Abby, Janet, Dan and I think that Turkish guy. Let's see if the coordination will work out considering the 2 time changes and the parties involved.  Hmm... I should probably dress warmer now that sun is setting.  I have a new obsession with sound quality of mp3s. Bad quality annoys me greatly now.  I average 6-8 hits a day. Who are you people!? Leave comments to the right.  ***

      [15492]   Flogging Molly  almost makes me wish I kept at the violin instead of becoming a jock in high school. Too bad I had more success in wrestling than I ever did as a violinist.  We got into the venue around 8:45 and I think the band took the stage around 9:15. We missed all the openers such as Go Betty Go and the Agrolites. It was a great show. They didn't play my favorite song May the Living Be Dead (In Our Wake), but it was nonetheless a great set.   I also came to realization that I miss having good abs and being able to go for hours in the pit. So either I have to drink lower calorie beer, or maybe just stick to shots... or work out like I used to. That means running 1.5 miles every morning on my own. Regulating my diet. Working out for 3.5 hrs in a heated gym (wearing sweats) and running bleachers in the afternoon / early evening. Repeat.   I think I sort of got on Julia's nerves when I told her why I think Dave Matthews tickets are so expensive.  I sort of worded things in a somewhat sexist manner, but I stand by my theory on prices for tickets. I basically said that Dave Matthews caters to a female population, who as trained consumers, buy into it the image of Dave Matthews and are willing to pay for it.  While a lot of people will deny it and come up with exceptions, most music scenes are male dominated. We're talking musicians, roadies, record company people, etc. The fan base is as well. That's not to say that there aren't women in scenes, but for hard rock, punk, and some indie it's mostly guys at shows for non "big" bands. I read interviews with Agent M of  Tsunami Bomb  and Debbie Harry of  Blondie  who have talked about the whole boys club attitude of rock. Of course I think it's wrong. I'll be the first to say that those girls are awesome and praise their coolness. However, we're not talking about the general public.   When a marketing director of a big record company tries to sell a band, he or she want to expand the demographics of the fans. Targeting women is a big deal, because they are huge image consumers. Not that men aren't, but there are major differences in how women and men shop and what they buy. Sociologists of gender and families have pointed out differences in how men and women communicate and interpret communication on a micro level. Think about that on a macro mass communications level. Admittedly those differences in recent years have changed due to things like the stupid metrosexual craze. However, we're dealing with people who have had years of socialization in "traditional" gender roles.  Music is immaterial and communicative much like all the things girls buy because they're "cute." Girls were long concerned with design before men. If suddenly more women find a band's music cool or the lead singer "cute," demand goes up. This correspondingly affects supply. Thus it affects ticket prices, as bands gain marketability with the larger female population.   ***

      [15488]  Today I went out to find a nice suit to wear for my cousin's wedding next week. One of the things I hate most is shopping for clothes. I don't mind when I've gone shopping with ex girlfriends or even when I accidentally get dragged into by female friends. However, when I have to do it myself... it just makes me feel fucking uncomfortable.  Here are some reasons why: 1) Realizing that I too am materialistic and superficial. Clothing is and has been one of the most basic things that delineate social class. Like Roman robes! I'm buying into the motherfucking capitalist system! Shit I even looked around South Coast Plaza for something! 2) Dealing with sales people. Fuck I want them to just leave me alone. 3) The time consuming aspect of finding something that fits and looks good. The thing with nice clothes is that they have to fit to look good. The biggest problem with my build is that I have pretty wide shoulders given the build of the rest of my body.  When I was going through suits it took forever to find something that fit me decently. 4) Spending money on something superfluous. 5) Parking at malls suck. Anyway.. I have a nice new suit after hours of work. I don't feel fulfilled though.  I should perhaps nap for a while.  **

      [15475]  Last night I went to the BJs in Cerritos with George. I've been to BJs 4 times since I've been back in CA. That frozen pizza prior to going and having chili fries with the beer made me nauseous.  The dentist I went to today was nice. I got dental goodies and a prescription for special mouth wash.  I watched some TV when I got home. Lost more brain cells.  I should really finish that paper and mail it tomorrow morning before going to UCI. I mentioned to Crystal that I'll be there at 2.  So it seems that Fallout 3 won't happen anytime soon. I'm going to rant on the software industry right now. Seriously, fantasy and adventure RPGs are a dying genre for computer games. It's really fucking sad. While it is true that console games make more money and it makes business sense to have games that can easily be transferred from PC to console, companies are neglecting a group of loyal consumers that have been around for a long time. As much as I love violence, and detail of new games, the humor, characters, and story in classic Sierra and LucasArts games are better than any that exist on a console.   I can't wait for the remake of QFG2 in VGA to come out.  ***

      [15462]  I just had the most awesome breakfast. Er... lunch? The hashbrowns I made were the most perfect hashbrowns I've ever made in terms of texture, color, and flavor. I may have made too much and resulted in me being super full right now, but oh man... they were so good! The mushroom, spinach, and onion omlette with mozarella cheese came out really well too. The edges were a bit wetter than I would have liked, but the middle part was just right. I don't like my eggs super well done or too wet.  Ok back by popular demand, Albert's analysis of gender roles in comics.  Today I will be discussing the role of the sidekick. I think we have to historically contextualize the creation of characters such as Robin and Jimmy Olson. They were created in an era before Michael Jackson, in which the young boys / men were not in such a suggestive situation. These characters were more or less super heroes in training, who were attempting to follow in the footsteps of their honorable, honest, and pure hero figures. This was an era in which idealized images of gender, right and wrong, and good and bad are clearly drawn. Take  urlLink this 1957 sex ed video  in which the coach is talking to his students about sexuality. Today we watch such a thing thinking it's kind of weird. However, the relationship depicted in the video is what the comics are aiming for.  At the same time the characters were stand ins for the young male reader in the fictional world. It is through the sidekick that they too could adventure with the superhero. I think that in today's society, the action hero is significantly different. First of all, the idea of sidekicks is no longer in fashion. The alienated loner figure is much more popular. Take the popularity of Wolverine in recent years. Yes he had several sidekick figures over the years, but those were always shortlived. Furthermore, things such as the Michael Jackson scandals and other sensationalized news stories have resulted in a general unease with the relationships between adults and children.  However, there is of course a gender bias. While in the more recent Batman movies, there was an effort to make sure Robin didn't look gay... the creators of Xena toyed with homosexuality in that television series. They inserted a great deal of innuendo into the stories in regards to the relationship Xena and Gabrielle had. This played on many contemporary themes and issues that were no present when Robin and Jimmy Olson were created decades earlier.  ***

      [15447]  I got this topic from Dr. Frank of  MTX 's blog. A lot of people compare the Bush Adminstration to Nazi Germany. Indeed, I feel that the Bush Administration has a horrifying foreign policy and very shady domestic security policy. However, they didn't have the same expansionist foreign policy and systematic domestic policy of elimination in concentration camps. Didn't Chomsky say that the United States is not a totalitarian regime in regards to use of force, and it is rather its consent building? While the Patriot Act sucks, it's certainly nothing like what went on in Stalinist Russia or the other fascist regimes of the early 20th century.  If anything it's closest to the British Empire in its militarism, imperialistic desires, and treatment of poor within its own borders. Actually many scholars say that America basically took over for the British Empire following WWII as the world hegemon.  I like how Dr. Frank updates his blog frequently and posts really insightful stuff. It would be really interesting if someone like Greg Graffin did that too.  Bad Religion  is my favorite band, but sometimes they seem either too busy for the common fan like they used to... or stuck up?  Anyway I'm see  MTX  on the 18th at Chain Reaction. See y'all there!?  ***

      [15430]  So I some really fucked up dreams last night that left me waking up soaked in sweat.  I had one dream where I was a ghost and I was going to the underworld. I had to say goodbye to Nai, Julia, Janet, and the hobbits from LOTR.  Then somehow I ended up in Cambridge. Dr. Dawson had recruited UCSS 2001 for a secret mission of some sort. I spent most of the time doing a lot of fucking running. Then I was trying to find the girls in the Fish and Chips place of doom.   There was some seriously fucked up shit going on in my head last night. That late night Jeno's pizza probably had something to do with it.  ***

      [15425]  I was chatting with Steff about various randomness of moderate social importance.  I'll share some of it here:  1) Flamingly gay 80s cartoons paved the way for acceptance of homosexuality in the 21st century. Ok that's just sort of a silly hypothesis, but you all have to admit that Snow Job, Gung Ho, and Shipwreck from GI Joe were pretty gay. That combined with Smurfs Vanity and Hefty, Rainbow Brite, Care Bears, and He-Man and you have some pretty homosexual role models, yet positive role models.  2) Superman and Batman as polar opposites of male gender identity. Superman was the good farm boy from Kansas with good morals. He often fought against the corrupt businessman. This was all during the suffering of the Great Depression. He never nailed Lois Lane though. Batman on the other hand got a lot of ass as millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne. He was a capitalist and had a pretty fucked up life. He didn't have Jonathan and Martha Kent turning him into Beaver Cleaver. Yet he is also brains versus the brawn of Superman. They are two opposing male ideals. Superman is the good guy and Batman is the bad boy.  Steff said she liked Superman better than Batman, but I like Batman more. Batman and his villains are much more three dimensional than Superman. I talked about Poison Ivy in a previous post. I might as well talk about Arnold's character... Mr. Freeze this time around. The modern Mr. Freeze character is that of a man who is tormented by a loss of love and to a certain extent his sexuality. He was created by corporate inhumanity and insensitivity to his wife's condition. The loss of his wife and his corresponding accident takes away what makes him a man. The immasculation of Victor Fries results in an opposing figure to the virile Batman.  Interestingly both Batman and Robin have "gay" sidekicks. Robin and Jimmy Olson. It's a funny thing about sidekicks, their sexuality is always questioned because of the whole admiration and willingness to die for another person of the same sex. The same was said about Xena and Gabrielle. This subject is for another post.  ***

      So I'm uploading my blogger files elsewhere then moving them to this webspace... what a bitch.  What the fuck is up with that?  Anyway... a pretty idle day. I have shit I should do, but I'm not doing it out of laziness.  So I was thinking last night... my friends are generally pretty cool, but most of them are even cooler drunk. Seriously... like some of my friends aren't the most sociable, but give them some hard liquor and they're chatting with everyone. Then some are just funny when drunk. I don't want to embarass anyone, so I won't name names... but I just want to say how cool y'all are when drunk.  Other thoughts... for the day. I was watching the History Channel and they had a thing on the history of non / less lethal weapons. The jackass in me wonders how it feels to be hit by a taser or the paintball filled with pepper spray chemicals. The academic in me is thinking about how they dated the first modern usages of such weapons to the 1960s. It's interesting how the 1960s mark wider cultural turns in lots of fields such as politics, economics, and apparently even military technology. I'm not like super-macro normally, but I do pretty much feel everything is connected somehow. Less- / non-lethal weapons are undoubtedly linked to various social movements and concerns in that era.  Ok and another personal thought before I do something else. I was watching the extremely horrible  Batman Forever . Now as much as I like Arnold and Jesse Ventura... that movie sucked ass. However, I'm bringing it up because of the character Poison Ivy. Her character is really nothing new in the scope of western literature. She is the evil temptress not unlike the one that tried to seduce Odysseus. Yes, I'm getting a bit Joseph Campbell on all y'all asses in this exposition... but the symbolic imagery to a certain extent does sort of reflect my own attitudes toward gender. The highly sexualized and materialistic woman is sort of the basis of my own misogynistic attitude. Let's be honest, south Orange County has plenty of images that are seen in  The O.C.  Anyway... I've often said that Irvine girls aren't my thing and I honestly do have a bias against them. There's a level of superficiality and materialism that is characterized by the Poison Ivy character that I see in a lot of women. Indeed Pamela Isley is a beautiful and brilliant villainess; however, her desires are that of a superficial materialism that women in our society (especially in places like Irvine) cling to. She uses men with her beauty, which is not unlike how women use men for status and free drinks. She cares about things like money and beauty. Yet at the same time Poison Ivy isn't necessarily the demon wench that other villainesses are. She is an exaggerated expression of a woman in our society and also represents the fear of men in our society of being used. It's like when a dude meets a hot chick, there's always the chance she might be a gold digger. Or she might brainwash you into being a slave? Yet at the same time history as established a dating system that puts men in a situtation where they are compelled to be put in these situations. I think the dynamic of the symbolism of the comic characters is accentuated with the image of  Batman . He is the rich guy with the cool car, that is the idealized male figure. In the various incarnations of the comic / cartoon / live action figure he is often seduced by Poison Ivy (and other female villains) which threaten to take away everything that makes him cool. This is a threat to his sexual power.  Anyway... all those tensions made me think about how like Batman, I for the most part choose a solo life. He dates, but never really settles down. Is it fear of a Poison Ivy? Or is fear of losing freedom? At the same time it's been 3 years since I was last involved with someone for an extended amount of time. Before that I was involved in a long ass relationship. So there is a duality that is difficult to navigate.  ***

      Ulrich Beck's risk society + Guy Debord's society of the spectacle and you pretty much have a society based on reactionary fear. The media industry is all about the fear of the spectacular and the reactions to it.   Indeed there are terrorists and there is tainted beef, but the probability of me dying on a hijacked plane or getting some bad beef is not that high.  I think the whole Michael Jackson scandal is another example.  Let's be honest, he's a freak. His child molestation case brings in the spectacularity of celebrity, but at the same time deals with real human fears of freaks hurting children. Fear of falling from grace. Fear of betrayal. He was someone that grew up with millions of people watching and people adored him. However, his continuous weird behavior worries and intrigues the public. He's a familiar person who's life is falling apart infront of us. His story is like that of a Greek tragedy. With the media industry magnifying every detail of the story, what's going on with Michael Jackson is blown up to conflate the real and unreal.  These are just some ramblings.  **

      [15842]  I cranked out a lot of reading and writing in the past few days.  So tired, and not all is done.  I helped Inhye with some interpretation of handwriting, and went to a potluck with Melissa. Then we watched  Breakfast at Tiffany's . I'm not sure if I get that movie. There's the whole call girl / gigelow angle along with being a "real phony." Also I'm not so sure about the whole "belonging" to someone when it comes to love.   Ok so yea... is there such a thing as being real? I really think in a way we're all real phonies. Do we really know what we want in life? Holly Golightly thought she did? In the end she had to re-evaluate everything (even herself). We can say that we want something and when we get it, not like it. It can be something as simple as a restaurant order, or something as complicated as relationships.  In my old age, I've become very skeptical about my wants and desires. I think it says a lot, when even the skeptic / cynic is hoping for something.  Who knows what the future holds?  LOTR (overrated) is kicking ass and winning lots of Oscars. No surprise?  ***

      Now playing: Anti-Flag - "Watch The Right"  Either Crystal was really drunk, or someone was IMing me under her name.  Fuminori finally called and we went to Sharkys... lots of beer, clams, fish sandwich, wings, fries... I came home quite full, but not really drunk. Yuengling is not very strong.  Now playing: The Casualties - "City Council"  I had weird dreams last night. Greg Graffin of Bad Religion was playing a house party full of fat people. Then there was a trial / dissertation defense in like a European style court. Then a weird dream about peeing.  I woke up in time for some of Teen Titans and then went back to sleep!  Now playing: The Living End - "Silent Victory"  I just had a tasty turkey sandwich with fries.  Ok... so today, I need to read and get some writing started.  ***

      Via Cissa... due to my bitching about being bored.   1. If you could pick out qualities and piece them together to create your soul mate, what qualities would she posess?    Intelligence, conversability, and humor... are qualities that I dig. I could never be with someone who I thought was dumb, couldn't handle conversations, and joke around. In terms of soul mate? I'd like to believe that there is such a thing, and if there is such a thing... she would be herself and not someone I create from my imagination. Expectations can be a great source of disappointment.    2. If you could be extremely wealthy for the rest of your life, and never have to worry about money ever again, but it meant you'd have to give up the life you were living now (i.e. change where you live, where you go to school, your family and friends), would you?    No. To a certain extent, I know what it's like to pick up and move far away from my friends and family to a totally unfamiliar environment. Indeed the money would keep me from being bored as I am here in Binghamton, but I owe so much to those close to me. (Correction... I haven't been that bored lately... tonight breaks with the recent trend)    3. If you could spend one day with one person from the past (someone dead), the present (someone alive now) and the future (someone who is not alive yet, i.e. future children, 90th president), who would you chose and why?    I'd chose one of my friends, because it's a sure thing that it'll be a good time. I'd probably want to hang with Brandon, Andy, George, Esther, or Melissa.     4. If you found out that you only had one month to live, how would you spend those 30 days? What would you do differently?    I would go to a lot of concerts, and museums... to understand my own humanity. I would spend time with the people I care about and tell them how important they are to me.    5. If you could put together a 3 day festival with 25-30 bands from any type of music genre (they all have to be alive now), what bands would you chose, who would headline, what would be the festival's name and where would it be held?   Day 1: 10 Foot Pole, Offspring, Descendents, Pulley, Rancid, Social Distortion, Alkaline Trio, AFI, Sex Pistols    Day 2: 1208, NOFX, Millencolin, Pennywise, Circle Jerks, Propagandhi, Anti-Flag, Randy, T(I)NC, Bad Religion  Day 3: MTX, Bigwig, Ataris, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Ozma, Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, Weezer  ***

      Grrr... people with caller ID blocked, should leave messages when they call. If that was Fuminori, I hope he calls back later.  Looks like I'll be visiting my aunt and uncle in NJ for spring break. They have a nice quiet place for reading and stuff. I need to go get a bottle of wine as my usual gift for them, when I visit.  Roughly 100 pages down, about 200 more to go by Monday, plus a paper and bibliography. Happy happy joy joy!  I'm gonna go make myself a screwdriver and read more.  ***

Yea so I've been sleeping a lot... so sue me. I'm feeling the weight of like 300 pages of reading, a paper, and a bibliography on my back... it's fun! (just kidding)  I've got some classic movies sitting on my desk.  Spellbound  and  Breakfast at Tiffany's .... should be good, but perhaps tomorrow night would be better.  ***

      Now playing: Depeche Mode - "Never Let Me Down Again"  I just bought 4 tickets to see  The Darkness  at the 9:30 Club in DC. It will be Queen wannabe glorious fun.  I also bought Trillian. Who says piracy doesn't result in real purchases? I used the program for 2 years and got so used to it that I had to buy it when I could no longer get glitchless pirate versions.  Mmm... turkey sandwich... on wheat...  Now playing: The Darkness - "I Believe In A Thing Called Love"  Man I've been really tired as of late. It's the whole going to sleep really late thing. However, the reasons for going to sleep really late recently has been for fun reasons. Late night dancing and singing to 80s music following Mardi Gras festivities? Oh yea and there was also some cross dressing... no it wasn't me this time.  Now playing: Mr T. Experience - "Stephanies of the World Unite"  I need to hand in my funding application today... so stressful!  ***

      [15831]   Now playing: Thursday - "Concealer"  I'm actually not a fan of Thursday, but it's playing nonetheless.  I'd also like to point that that Hume does not completely throw out the idea of God in the  Dialogues , but simply poke wholes in the design argument. I don't remember what Philo's exact stance is, but I think it's agnosticsm.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have did the extra religious studies minor in addition to all the freaking degrees I have. I was 3 courses away from it.  Now playing: Virus 9 - "77 Threat"  I went to a talk on racism and Asians today. It was interesting, but I think the think I'd like to point out is that the professors' use of the word "racism" might not be quite right. While it is perhaps a word similar to what ancient Asians might have used, it does not necessarily mean that the same sense of race existed back then as it does now. Indeed there was difference based on social location based on power, and identity; however, was it phenotypical or cultural / ideological / political? I'm not an expert on ancient, or even modern Asian history, so I don't know. I only know that racism as we know it today is a construct of capitalism and slavery.  Now playing: Casualties - "Die Hards"  I have a lot of shit to do tomorrow morning.  ***

      [15816]   Now Playing: Black Flag - "What I See"  So last night I had dream that Melissa and I had a discussion similar to Hume's  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion .  So in Scottish Englightment philosopher David Hume's (1711-76)  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion  an argument is presented through the dialogue between three characters (Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea).  Essentially the argument is mostly between Philo and Demea against Cleanthes who argues for the big clock maker concept of God. What that means is that God created the universe and set it in motion. Cleanthes makes some arguments and from there Philo begins to poke holes in the design argument. Some of major problems come from the issue of using analogy,  a priori  arguments, assumptions, and human error.  Now playing: Pennyise - "Running Out of Time"  That's sort of the background behind the setting, but our imaginary discussion had more to do some of the pragmatic issues in religion... such as the difference between the Old Testament God and the New Testament God. There were also arguments about basic beliefs and stuff.   Fascinating that I have such philosophical dreams huh?  Anyway some basic thoughts on religion for the rest of you:  As irreverant as I am, I have no problem with people believing what they want as long as they don't proselytize. While ignorance is bliss, ignorance is dangerous. I'm a firm believer that people should be aware of the history of their beliefs and the negative ways it has been used to legitimize heinous events in human history I also believe in the relativity of beliefs through out time-space. Beliefs are not timeless as some would think, and they change over time. People should regonize the pragamitic aspects of belief, in that belief systems serve purposes and do not exist outside of social action. Now playing: The Police - "Synchonicity II"  Something that I was thinking about this morning.... there's this thing I don't feel cool about and it is about conflicting interests. Some rivarlies are healthy, some things are worth fighting for, but those are things that you don't know until after the fact.  Yesterday was long, but fun.  ***

      [15811]  Now playing: 1208 - "Lies that Lie"  I'm somewhat clueless about the readership of my blog. Apparently there are random passersby, and I know there are friends that come more regularly than others; however, I really need to have a better way of keeping track of who's lurking out there.  Now playing: NOFX - "Franco Un-American"  So I was chatting with Melissa today while I was waiting for the bus and I mentioned that I can somewhat be myself around her. That's actually half true... in that I'm one of my two very different personalities around her. I'm the crazier and more immature Albert around her. I'm more like the person I am back in California, than the person I am when I'm here... when I talk to her. This has to do with the fact that I think she can understand me, better than the other graduate students who are further along in their lives and want different things in life.  Now playing: Dropkick Murphys - "This is Your Life"  See the thing is here I don't have my  Posse , nor do I have the inspiration for my "madness" simply because my reputation didn't really follow me here. People here didn't see what I did in high school, no one was there in Vegas, nor present to what I've done at parties, witness the stage dives and action in the pit. People here see a much more mature version of Albert... a version that is perhaps not quite ready to take over control of my life.   I'm such a pussy... the real me would have gone to Albany to see  Pennywise  instead of going to Walmart.  Now playing: Sublime - "40 oz. to Freedom"  I have a lot of work to do... after Teen Titans  ***

      [15806]  Today was class, meeting on funding, and watching the rest of  Strange Days .  I think a big component of my weird feelings lately is the lack of certainty for the future. The truth is that I have no idea what I'm going to do next year if I don't have funding. I only have one more semester of coursework after this semester, which means that if I don't have funding, I don't know what I'm going to do the following 2 semesters. Will I be here doing TA work? Or will I just do things like area papers back in CA? This complicates things such as signing leases, checking boxes on financial aid applications, and just having a sense of security for where I'll be.  It sucks not knowing where you'll be next year. This is a lot like when I was applying to grad school. Not so much the undergrad... because I knew I was going somewhere... this time around thoughts such as... am I wasting my time? come up. The past year and a half have been so mediocre. I don't feel like I've accomplished much, nor have I really gotten to grow much. Everything just feels extremely liminal.   I won't know anything until the end of March or early April. So... much stress...  **

      [15793]   According to random passerby Kara, I perhaps intellectualize everything here on my blog.  I guess today I'll try to be different and talk about emotions.  I've had this feeling the past few days that I'm forgetting / missing / or not doing something. It's this weird thing that's been hanging over my head. That combined with other confusions in my life is leaving me feeling out of phase with reality.  I've bitched about this before, but here in Binghamton... I just don't feel like the same person that I do back in California. Maybe that's why I feel like there's a lack in my life?  I feel an empty desire. I know that life in California isn't the same as what it was before I came out here.   **

      [15792]   Two of my friends are pissed at one another. They are both blaming one another for different things, when really no one is at fault. What the problem is differences in communication, and perspective (which is often gender oriented). They both tell me seemingly completely opposite accounts of conversations. Jokes become attacks, understatements become lies, and soon friendliness turns into anger.  I'm a postmodernist, so I don't believe in objective reality and believe in only subjectivity.  The problem is that in communication there is the issue of transferring thought into speech, and if that isn't hard enough... there is the issue of the receiver having to interpret what the speaker says. That means that an idea goes through multiple filters before reaching its destination. I think this is an issue between my two friends. Saying what you mean is closer to saying what you think you mean. Correspondingly what you hear is what you think you hear. There is a large communicative ravine between speaker and listeners. This is further complicated by their perspectives on one another and their own emotions at present. This means their subject position is an integral part in how they communicate. Unfortunately I don't know how this can lead to a resolution to their problems. Self-relexive discourse perhaps? However that assumes some level of rationality, and how rational can you be if you "feel" you've been hurt by someone you care about?  I feel really bad about this and hope they resolve these issues without coming out of this hating one another.  ***

I ate at the Food Coop w/ Melissa today... a student run place, not the corporate, prison running, crap food serving Sodhexho food court.  Oh yea and the weather is getting fucking cold again. The weather says wintry mix on Friday, which means no Pennywise for me. Bleh...  I chit chatted with Crystal on the phone today, cause I was bored and didn't wanna do work. The lucky girl got today off due to Presidents day...  Now playing: No Use For A Name - "Sleeping in"  I'm not particularly happy with my lack of energy lately... maybe it's cause I'm not following my work out plan?

      [15736]  Now playing  Ten Foot Pole  - "Denial"  Yes Crystal, but at the same time the lyrics and politics of the Sex Pistols (if they had a politics) is blind anarchistic and nihilistic rage, as opposed to the pop friendly Beatles. The Beatles were not really a political band in the same sense, but members of the band such as Lennon and McCartney were very political. The Sex Pistold on the other hand, their lyrics became the battle cry of both disenfranchised youth as well bored suburban kids. In their mobilization, there was a lack of the sophistication of a band like the Clash, who were more concerned with human rights lyrics than screaming, "anarchy," "no future," and "pretty vacant." Dead Kennedys on this side of the planet, were closer to Sex Pistols in their lack of any sort of coherent politics in it's criticism of American politics. They were pretty much saying fuck all American politics, without really stating what's specifically wrong with it. Other bands such as X-Ray Spex had some clever things to say about sexism and consumerism. Bad Religion commented on latch key kids, and religion. That's not to say these bands (or their members) weren't powerful voices for its listeners, but the real question is what sort of messages were they sending?   Now playing: Hot Hot Heat - Get in or Get Out  I think there's a lot of be said on the issue of politics in popular culture. For those of you don't know, it's somewhat of one of my areas of study in regards to media... although mostly in movies not music.  Something else that's been sort of my mind is Wal-Mart. I went there with Inhye this weekend for groceries and she needed to get windshield wiper fluid. If certain types of music are somewhat dumbed down in terms of politics (no offense to those bands, since I do like them), Wal-Mart is the pure retardedness of consumerism. It's amazing how that place with it's poor design, and crappy products can be one of the most profitable retailers in the world. Nevermind what scholars say about the intensification of design in high-capitalism, Wal-Mart is a living breathing Fordist enterprise. What's even more interesting is that when you go to Wal-Mart, you see the people that the sludge of American culture has enveloped. This is where you see working poor, who shop there because its cheap, but get sucked into the excessive consumerism of buying as much cheap shit as possible. They aren't really saving money, because they're buying a lot of junk, which is lots of unhealthy mass produced snack foods... which further their obesity.  Man I hate Wal-Mart... it's all that's wrong in this world, but alas it's cheap and I'm a poor student.  I woke up at 6:30 this morning... and I'm like all out of it. If things don't make sense... too bad.  ***

Inhye is supposed to be over later to discuss the readings for our class and give me a ride to the grocery store.  Now plaing: Ozma - Spending Time on the Borderline  I need to organize my time better from now on. I should try to do readings in the morning.

      [15726]   As a result of a few websites and some discussions with friends, I want to talk a bit about politics in regards to the so-called punk movement.  While someone such as Ben Weasel calls the so-called anarchists and communists of the punk movement idiots (including those involved with punkvoter.com), the criticism is somewhat misplaced. There's a big difference between bands such as Bad Religion, the International Noise Conspiracy and Propagandhi and bands like the Sex Pistols, NOFX, Unseen, and Pennywise. It's a matter of rhetoric and engagement with the bigger picture. That's not to say Sex Pistols, NOFX, Unseen, and Pennywise's lyrics are not powerful in regards to their political rhetoric, they do not engage in a more complex discourse of social and political problems. Whether or not these bands and their fans understand the relavence of global capitalism and political economy in the things they sing about is a different story, but simplistic cries of anarchy, murder the government, and revolution sound stupid without good arguments. Indeed for all the problems with the United States, it's not Iraq, China, or various places in Latin America. Simply saying America sucks sounds retarded, when a suburban kid who's parents bought him or her a car for a 16th birthday and is able to listen to various punk bands in it. However, other bands such as Bad Religion encourages not necessarily blind rage against the establishment, but a critical analysis and understanding of the social problems that our world is plagued with. T(I)NC, while much more revolutionary at least has a better understanding of socialism than the average college graduate. Propgandhi's critiques are poignant and point out social problems more so than urging violent unrest.  I think the fundamental problem is with thinking. Not enough people these days think critically about what goes on around them. They accept what bands tell them, what TV tell them, and what professors tell them. I'm a firm believer that objectivity is inachievable and that the best you can do is search for answers in a variety of different places.  However, I am against the arbitrary calling of all people who care about politics hippies. Nevermind that rednecks are worse than hippies and they actually vote in order to make sure they can still carry guns, and keep minority groups oppressed.  While I call for more critical understanding of social issues, I think that the political mobilization of the angry revolutionary bands has some benefits.  ***

      [15717]  Ever think the character Owen Wilson plays in all his movies would be annoying to hang out with in real life? I dreamed that I hung out with him last night. His rambling is only cool on the screen.  Because my laptop has issues with graphics type stuff... like Photoshop causing it to blue screen, WinTV locks up from time to time. Maybe that's good? I won't be a total couch potato?  Anyway yesterday I went to office hours for a prof to figure out what I should do my paper on, and then went to a reception for some of my profs who recently released books. Lots of wine...  Then I went to a meeting for Traffic... it was alright.   I got to watch Smackdown last night... I couldn't help but chuckle when Angle asked the Big Show, "You eat crap for breakfast?"  ***

      [15711]  I didn't go and sit in on class today, because I decided that since I had to leave early for the cable guy... it'd be better to just stay home. So now I have cable!!! I just watched the very cool episode where Tasha Yar goes back in time with the Enterprise C.  I missed you oh TV!  I have to call the cable company about some weird billing tomorrow though.  Ok off to campus to do some stuff...  ***

      [15707]  I've been napping a lot in the afternoons.  I watched  Once Upon A Time in Mexico ... it wasn't as good as  Desperado . Johnny Depp was cool though.  So what's the point of anti-systemic movements when capitalism always wins?  Oh yea... fuck testicle-less politicians...  **

      [15703]  Yesterday was an interesting day. It snowed a lot and I chose to attempt going to class; however, the bus got stuck on the way there and I ended up walking 1/3 of the way to school... only to find out class was cancelled. So what I did was print out some stuff for class and hang out with Melissa on campus. It was cool. That was first time playing in snow... making snowballs and helping make a snowman. I don't count the fake snow they pumped into the quad in high school as real snow, nor the slush fight in Reno real snow. It was cool. Then I went with Melissa to the PAL meeting and met some nice people. They were much nicer there than at TASC. Some of us will probably go drinking Friday night.  Today I had lunch with Kazu. That was cool 'cause I haven't hung out with him in months. It was cool. We both bitched about our uncertain futures in grad school.  I'm going to hang around on campus a bit and go to a prof's office hours and see if my paper was dropped off in the Art History office.  I keep thinking there's something important I have to do tonight... but that whole 5 day weekend thing has be all thrown off.  ***

      [15689]  I have a friend that's really been getting on my nerves. I feel bad, because she doesn't mean to get on my nerves and he's geniunely good person. However, she's perhaps just too nice of a person. Her comments and questions are just too naive and goody goody. When we chat online, I get annoyed with how ignorant she is of so much. I really think she's someone that needs to get out more and enjoy a decadent and debauchery filled life while she's still young. Then she wouldn't be as annoying.   I think the same can be said about one of my male friends... who's sense of humor and social skills can use some work.  I feel bad for thinking these things, because they don't try to be annoying and are good people.  **

      [15688]  Listening to some  Millencolin  right now... "Kemp" from their  Home from Home  (2002)  Last night Inhye gave me a ride to Giant (supermarket chain for you Californians), which was nice. It allowed me to get heavy stuff like milk and juice as well as lots of other groceries. Then we hung out at my place and chatted for a few hours. Hah she said I'm mature for a 23 year old for liking Duran Duran. It was cool.   After she left, I made a burrito with my fresh groceries. Mmm.. beans, rice and cheese...  Next random track is  Green Day   "Coming Clean" from their  Dookie  (1994)  I didn't do much else last night, I went to sleep kind of early.  I had weird dreams last night involving... Emeril, Piebald, an email from Melissa, and corned beef. It was bizarre.   Now  The Living End  is playing... "Staring at the Light" from their  Roll On  CD (2001)  I'm going to make myself breakfast now.  ***

However, if there's repetition of common themes, does it mean anything?   Also I shouldn't have NPR as my alarm, because my sense of reality in the mornings isn't always there.  I don't want to get all Freudian, so I just stop there for now.  Now playing - The Descendents - "Talking"  My place is a mess. I want to clean it up before I leave on Friday for D.C.  I should go have breakfast and get shit done before the meeting at noon.  ***

      [16019]   Now playing:  Weezer 's  Blue Album: Deluxe Edition  (specifically the accoustic version of Jamie)  I haven't heard that version since high school, when I borrowed one of Brandon's Weezer singles. I was listening to my new CDs while waiting for the bus at Walmart yesterday, and I couldn't help but remember listening to Weezer on the little hill infront of small gym back in Irvine High waiting for rides home. The summer before sophmore year and doing that for some reason is the most vivid. I remember listening to my mix tape with Weezer and Bad Religion on it. This was Weezer's  Blue  and taped versions of singles off Brandon's single and the Undone single I had bought myself. I was also listening to  Bad Religion 's  Stranger than Fiction  a lot. By the end of summer, I'll have gotten  Generator  and been listening to that a lot too.   I didn't get into the  Descendents  until later in high school... until after I bought  Somery  maybe at the end of my junior? I think I bought it was Circuit City...   Most of the CDs I bought in high school were from Tower Records in Tustin, and I think possibly one or two from the Wherehouse... now most of the ones I buy are from Amazon.com.  I feel kind of good that the bands I liked in high school are still active. I wasn't listening to any one hit wonders.  Oh for those of you don't know, I'm learning how to rollerblade to get my ass out of my chair and go out and enjoy spring weather. There are several reason's why I chose rollerblades... it's something new, I won't look like a poseur like if I had gotten a skateboard (remember when Hasani was walking around with one?), and they don't get flat tires. I remember getting lots of flat tires on my bike in the high school days. Biking home 3 miles with a flat tire is not fun.  ***

      [16013]   Now playing: Sublime - "What I got"  Albert feels much more like Albert, now that he's gone out 2 nights in a row and had a lot of drink... the sunshine helps too.  In response to Nai's comment, the problem with blogs is that either they're often self-censored... I actually often delete my own posts, because I don't want the people I write about to read it. But what does it say about memory and feelings? What does this deletion mean in regards to one's dealing with thoughts and emotions?  Now playing: Rancid - "Salvation"  I have a lot of work to get done, that I don't want to do. Maybe I'll paint instead of do work? I'm getting all hobbied up right now... painting and rollerblading...  Day #2 of rollerblading yielded some better results, but I still have a long way to go.  My mood is a lot better right now... I think a big factor is the changing weather. Although at the party last night, it seems that lots of people are feeling tired with the semester. There was some interesting conversation as well...  Someone gave me some good advice on love and life... She was asking why I don't have a girlfriend and all that. She said that for someone as young as me, I shouldn't be settling and falling back like older people. I still have plenty of opportunity, unlike many of the people at the party. The thing is, I don't know if I can follow it. I don't know where I am in life right now, and it makes it hard to make right decisions.  Now playing: Ramones - "California Sun"  ***

      I was just reading the blogs of a bunch of friends and it seems like I'm not the only one feeling annoyed with aspects of life. However, I can't help but think of some the lessons in  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  That was a brilliant fucking movie by the way, and I totally recommend it.  I guess one of the lessons of the movie is that you despite your wanting to forget things like your feelings, it's not something you can really erase. Part of this is due to the fact that underneath all the crappy memories, are good ones that your mind doesn't want to forget. However, those good memories are inexplicably tied to the bad ones. It's like the Facts of Life theme song.  It's funny though, despite all the stuff that the movie goes over... in the realm of blogs on Xanga, Livejournal, or wherever... people do seem to focus on the negative a lot more. People are archiving away their bad memories, instead of erasing them. Do we want to remember the bad? It is part of our lives afterall, and maybe that's why Kirsten Dunst's character does what she does at the end.  It helps us grow as a people?  Maybe I'm just evil, but I can laugh at most stuff from my past these days... I can entertain myself and others with stories about exes... In fact, I can joke about the drama in my life right now... but there's a lot of other stuff I just don't know about.  I mean I just don't know where my life is going, and there's still so much to figure out. The future past is not layed out like in the anti-narrative of the movie.  ***

I bought rollerblades, but right now I suck.  ***

      [15989]   Who will be 16,000? Make sure you leave a message!  I'm not really impressed by the recently leaked tracks from the new Bad Religion album...   I was somewhat amused by  The OC 's self-parody of  The Valley ...  I am somewhat amused by the new BR song, "Los Angeles is Burning" though... They actually quote themselves in the song... sort of like  The OC ... "this is not a test," and "how could hell be any worse?"  But the songs are not where as cool as the ones from  Process of Belief   Today was wasteful due to the copiers not working when I was on campus... it's funny how idleness has eaten up so much of my time recently. However, today I felt energized by the nice weather... Prof. Lee said you could tell that the California boy in me totally enjoying the niceness of weather.  I burned myself a new CD with some tasty new music and walked to campus today...  There was a light breeze, which is nice. Gemini is an air sign afterall... I've always had an affinity for wind. I remember back in elementary school, really enjoying how the wind felt when you faced the eucalyptus trees.   I keep thinking of buying stuff from bikes, Vespas, to skateboards, to rollerblades...   So if I had a bike... would it be weird to ride my bike to a bar, drink, and then ride back home?  ***

I actually think the sounds of it goes hand in hand with that of Police Rape classics such as "Silver Dollar Pancakes" and doo wop song.   Now playing: Ozma - "Game Over"  So who are the rest of you?   So I have a bunch of reading to do and I've got to photcopy stuff and I'm going to a talk today.  I'm gonna burn a new CD for my listening pleasure. Should I stick with one band, or mix things up?  Now playing: Alkaline Trio - "Another Innocent Girl"  I've been losing weight recently... due to laziness, lack of fatty red meat, and other factors... I need to stuff myself.  **

      [15972]   Becky wants to dress me up as "Latin Lover Man." All I can say is that was one bizarre conversation.  Last night there was also a discussion over something that Melissa pointed out to me in Asian Outlook. She was offended by Nick's statements about the sexism and biases in so-called culture, because of the problematizing of "culture."  Esther and Crystal agreed with Nick on some of the issues. However, Esther was annoyed in how Nick characterized things as just physical waving around of scarves. Like Melissa had said, these aren't really about "talent" as these things have to be easy enough for people to participate. There is a "cultural" aspect to it. For Esther, she feels that cultural shows spark dialogue and interest in not so much "tradition" but history. I disagree on that point on history, but I'll get back to it.  Crystal said that aspects of Korean culture are "stifling." She said she loves Korean culture, and points out it is easier to point out problems than solve it. After all these three girls of completely different Asian backgrounds, as well as myself... all find the problem of "fitting in" and culture problematic.  See the problem is, tradition is an interpretation of history, that is steeped in ideology. That's why I disagree with Esther on the issue of sparking interest in history. As Melissa pointed out, this is further complicated by immigration. We aren't Chinese, Fillipino, Taiwanese, or Korean... we're hypenated Americans. In the case of Melissa and Crystal, they're double hyphenated. Furthermore, the four of us are, as some people might say, "Twinkies." So in this context, how do we interpret history through the lenses of our identities and culture?  It is my own personal opinion that culture is what  we  make of it, because it is part of our own identities. Indeed it is hard to negotiate the difficult terrains of identity and culture, but as Satre says, "Tu n'es rien d'autre que ta vie. . . ." (You are nothing else but your life." It is ultimately up to you to live your life, and I believe that one does have enough agency to make culture to work for them. It is possible to come up with a culture that does not draw on racist, sexist, and oppressive histories. However, at the same time, people have the right to make choices and some may chose to ignore the problems in favor of the pure aesthetics of the culture.  I could go on and on forever about this, but I'll stop for now.  ***

      [15950]  Now playing: Smashing Pumpkings - "Soma"  I should really fix the javascript on my page... it's starting to bug me.  Ever get the feeling you were being watched? It seems like a lot of people are saying they "saw," or "know," me or something about me... that I didn't know that they did. It's somewhat unnerving...  Now playing: Tom Jones - "She's a Lady"  On the other hand, I saw a lot of people around today and did a bit of chatting with most.  I haven't gotten much work done the past few days.  So it's a funny thing, every couple of weeks or so... I go into MS Outlook and schedule myself to get my ass up early to work out and / or do work... but it never happens. I'm getting in the mood to do that again, but I'm holding back so I don't feel like failure when it doesn't happen.  Now playing: Operation Ivy - "Take Warning"  Hmm Op Ivy... when Tim Armstrong was cool. Oh how do things change!  Lately I've also been thinking about doing things like getting a bike... maybe after I find out where I'll be living next year.  ***

      [15932]   Now playing: Bob Marley - "No Woman, No Cry"  I feel so... I dunno... the snow, the lack of class, the feeling of lack in general... it's got me in a weird mood. It's a mood, in which... if I was in Irvine, I'd totally call up someone from the Posse for a trip to BJs or something. Just something to get out and do something.  I feel like I'm lacking something, but I don't know what it is... lack of security, lack of contenment with my current life, lack of things I desire...   Right now I really desire going out and doing  something .  Now playing: Descendents - "She Loves Me"  Dude, the past few songs that Winamp has been playing has been like of psuedo emo...  Social D  was playing before these two songs.  Ok I'm going to skip ahead to a song that will get me pumped up for  something .   Little Richard's "Good Golly Miss Molly" will do for now.  So at the same time there's desire and lack in my life, there's also avoidance... there are some truths and realities I don't want to deal with. For example, I have all these things I want to do, but don't do. There are all these things I shouldn't do that I do. There are a bunch of things I should do, that I sort of do.  It'd be nice to be motivated about more in life.... or simply  something .  Now playing: NOFX - "All Out of Angst"  I think if there's any word that really describes how I feel, it's incomplete. Doctor, cure me; what is the cause of my condition, This madness shoots me, Like bullets smashing glass in silent movie, I’m a trap without a spring, a temple with no god, A jack without an ace, the tip of your tongue, I’m a promise, an unmailed letter, An unbuilt motor, deck without a joker, A creeping gray memory I am incomplete...  - "Incomplete" by Bad Religion **

      [15918]   Now playing: The Strokes - "Someday"  Wednesday: I took a 10:35 AM bus and got to NYC a bit before 2 PM and then went to NJ. I had dinner and stayed at my aunt and uncle's place. It was a nice evening, because I got drunk from a continuous flow of wine and passed out at 7:30 PM.  Thursday: I spent most of the day alone at my aunt and uncle's place quietly reading. I got a lot of work done. I now have a better idea about what to write for one of my papers now. My aunt took me to Fuddruckers for lunch and later that night we went to a little Japanese restaurant in Ridgewood for some sashimi.  Now playing: Eddie Money - "Shakin'"  Friday: I got back up to NYC a bit too early Friday morning. So I hung out at the weird Burger King next to the Port Authority. It's weird, because I always see interesting people go in and out of it. Also when I was hanging out outside waiting for Melissa, I saw a voodoo lady, interesting bums, and some slutty looking chicks. Anyway, eventually Melissa and I met up and then she showed me the sights of Flushing. Melissa, Becky, and I wandered around a cemetary, got gyros, got tea and went to CBGBs. There was a lot of hilarity that continued until late night.  CBGBs was cool, but had over priced beer. $6.25 for a bottle of Heineken, meant that the coolness wore off as the beer wore off. This and Detox Darlings weren't bad, but were trying to live in the 80s a bit too hard.  Now playing: Smashing Pumpkins - "Sweet Sweet"  Saturday: We got some bagels from the infamous Bagel Oasis that morning and then saw some virtual dragonboating. We also hung out with my cousin Kelly for a bit before I took a Greyhound back to Binghamton.   There was more hilarity on Saturday too, but it's hard to describe. I had a lot of fun.  I stopped by a GSO downtown before going home. Got myself a few free slices of pizza, beer, and wine. It wasn't that great.  Sunday: So far today I've done my laundry, saw  Old School , and got some Burger King.  Now playing: Sting - "Desert Rose"  Stuff to do for the rest of today:  print shit out on campus read that shit Now playing: Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros - "Road to Rock and Roll"  ***

      [15904]   I will be out of town until Saturday night or Sunday afternoon.  I'll be in NJ for the next two days with relatives. Then I'll be hanging with Melissa on Friday. I'm going to try to meet up with my cousin Kelly on Saturday afternoon before I come back to Binghamton.   Cell me if you need to reach me. I won't have internet access for a few days! (Well there's wireless web)  I need to fix some of the javascript on this page when I get back.  ***

      [15899]   Now playing:  Bad Religion  - "Fuck Armageddon... this is Hell"  I downloaded some of the digitally remastered Bad Religion songs from the Epitaph webapge (they're 192 Kbps!!!)  Why the hell are some books on 1 Day Reserve... I'm being screwd over on some readings...  I'm getting out of town in 1 Day!!!  Now playing: Bad Religion - "Generator"  So I saw  All About Eve . It's a good movie. I want to look up some of the quotes that the character Bill Sampson makes about the nature of celebrity.   I'm hungry  **

      [15890]  Now playing: Beethoven - "Ave Maria"  I really get upset when veggies go bad. My broccoli didn't even last a week in my fridge, and my spinach is all gross. I get upset because it's a waste of money and food. Then I get further annoyed at how here in Binghamton, we lack the super fresh produce of good old California.  Now playing: Johann Strauss - "Blue Danube Waltz"  I've been in a total classical mood lately, when it comes to music. Lots of Wolfgang and Ludwig van playing as I study... I've actually also been wanting to buy some cheapo classical or jazz CDs. You know the $5 ones you often find sitting in a bin at various music retail locations? It's kind of bitch downloading music online these days (especially via dialup). I need more study music.  Now playing: Giacchino Rossini - "Barber of Seville Overature"  Speaking of buying stuff... I feel like I've been spending a lot of money lately. Regular expenses, plus a bag for travel, books, and a Greyhound ticket. Also there's cool stuff coming out soon.  March 23 - The Descendents -  Cool To Be You  March 23 - Weezer -  The Blue Album: Deluxe Edition   April 6 - Bad Religion - Along the Way DVD / Epitaph reissues June 8 -  Bad Religion  -  The Empire Strikes First  Summer - Me First and the Gimmes -  Live in a Dive  November - Propagandhi - TBA Fall - Social Distortion - TBA I'll probably be buying some of this shit. I'm such a fucing consumer.  Now playing: Giuseppe Verdi - "La Traviata Prelude"  Speaking of consumerism, I need to do a write on some readings on the topic.  ***

      [15886]  Now playing:  The Darkness  - "I Believe in Thing Called Love"  Wow yesterday was long and fun. Melissa and I made potstickers and soba noodles and went to the the Duke Ellington Orchestra performance at the Anderson Center. Good food, good music, and good company. I liked the more lively songs. Afterwards I played "consultant" on her art history paper and we had stromboli delivered. I didn't leave her place until 6 AM. The sun was rising as I walked home.  Today... I slept until 2 PM, ate leftovers and did some work for Traffic.  My sleep habits are all out of it.   Now playing:  Operation Ivy  - "Knowledge"  Maybe I'll drink some coffee and do some reading before the  Simpsons .  ***

      [15867]  I thought I'd talk about the most useful / memorable classes I've taken:  Humanities Core at UC Irvine Arts Core at UC Irvine Elizabethan Science, Magic and Medicine in Cambridge History of Coffee at UC Irvine AP European Civ in high school Sociological Theory at UC Irvine I don't know if the order is quite right, but it is roughly in order.  Those classes really provided foundations for a lot of what I'm interested in and do now in graduate school. Without a doubt those classes really molded how I approach my academic work. The two core series I took at UCI had a profound impact on me, because of their interdiscplinary approaches to studying visual, as well as historical artifacts and events. They made me thinking of the cultural, political, and economic relavences and contexts of art, architecture, and even literature. At the same time they really made me think about how academic disciplines should be irrelavent because they are unrealistic in understanding the world.   This is just something that I was thinking about as I made photocopies earlier tonight, because in several of my courses right now I'm building on these courses and some of the issues about disciplinary boundaries have been popping up a lot lately.  I'm thirsty... for beer.  ***

      The future is a continuation of the past, thus I go into detail about something I started rambling about yesterday.  This funding thing has got me thinking a lot about the future. It makes me think about the  Descendents ' "When I Get Old." Will I still want to be someone and not just who I am. I don't want to be like other adults, because they already died... Cruel, condescending, fossilized Will I be rich? will I be poor? Will I still sleep on the floor? What will it be like? When I get...  What will I be like, when I get old I sort of wonder where Milo Ackerman, the lead singer of the Descendents who has a phd, was when he sang that song. It was at least after he "went to college."  I'm skeptical about getting funding, but who knows... I could... I could not? Last year I didn't think I had a chance, but less was on the line. My wants and desires... do I want to stay? who am I right now? if I don't know what I am, what does it say about my wants? All this will be more clear in a month... however, the uncertainty will come up again later...   I guess a lot of this has to do with the fact I'm in a transitional phase in my life right now. Soon I'll be done with courses, which means I'll really have to start doing my own research. As a professor of mine says, "you become a knowledge producer." Am I ready to do stuff like that?   (By the way, this same professor said he didn't quite get  Breakfast at Tiffany's  either).  I've talked about my schizophrenia before. From 9/20/2003:  "I'm 23 and I always feel a pull between wanting to stay young and having to grow up.  People say I've done a lot in my life despite my age. I was an athelete, musician, involved in student government in high school. I've volunteered at high schools, coached wrestling, and worked 4 very different jobs. I had 2 majors and a minor and I'm in a phd program right now. I've seen cities all over California, and been to Reno, Vegas, Taiwan, Mexico, and Western Europe. I've stage dove, moshed, been to operas and musicals, the great museums of the world and been to a fringe festival more or less. I've seen a punk rock midget, S&M people, prostitutes in Amsterdam, and met pro-wrestlers. I've been drunk, beaten, bloody, and burned. I've been in newspapers and I have many friends. You would think that I've lived enough to grow up. Or perhaps since I've lived an interesting life, I'm reluctant to grow up.  This growing up thing, where I should act and dress more respectably is tough. At some point in the next few years, I'll end up teaching college course and eventually be called professor... I'll have to look and act professional. I can't be as nihilist or apathetic as I am now. I shoud be worrying about getting a job when I graduate and becomeing "successful." Yet I'm still in a phase of my life right now where I still want to stage dive at shows, crush beer cans with my skull, and wear punk band shirts." Not much has been resolved in 6 months... So I still don't know if I feel ready to grow up. But what really is growing up? Significantly older women seem to always be telling me that I'm so mature for my age. Am I (a real phony)?   I guess I'm in a transitory part of my life right now. I don't know if passerby Tara still comes by, but she once asked if I ever just spill out raw emotion. However, I don't know how to express the confusion within me right now about where I am in my life. I am sure of one thing... I'm not afraid. It's more of a awkwardness and unease. It's like being in a fun house and walking on something wobbly. You know you aren't in any real harm, so you aren't scared; however, it's awkward and uneasy. You don't really know what's ahead of you (or below, and around you) in fun houses. Actually those two words are pretty accurate in describing my feelings in general right now.  I don't have fear for the future, because I'm confident things will be alright.  I just had clam chowder, my favorite soup. Kind of fattening, but considering I ate at the food coop AND worked out... it all balances out. (Actually I don't care about eating fatty foods, because I eat healthy in general)  Oh yea... Crystal... it's cool. I knew something was up. It was just weird, because I was all like... this seems rather uncharacteristic of Crystal even if she is drunk.  Yes a very long post!  ***

      [16236]  My illness is fading...  It's funny thing about life. Right when things seem to be falling into place, such as knowing about funding, having a good time with people, and having shows to see... things have to change. Yea, I've bitched about things, but in general this year has been many times better than last year.  Anyway I have a lot of work to get done this week before I'm busy with fun stuff this weekend and the Bouncing Souls show next week. I better get to it.  ***

      [16222]   I've come to the conclusion I can't separate who I am, from my academic work. I simply would not be studying the things that I am without listening to the music I listen to. My academic beliefs (as well as my identity) are inseparable from the fact that I grew up in southern California.  urlLink Postmodern  theory, ideas about consumerism,  urlLink spatial organization  and culture all come out of me listening to punk rock in Disney-centric Orange County in the 80s and 90s. Also the fact that I'm 23 should be a sign to academic people around me that I'm not at a point in my life where I want to stop having crazy youthful fun.   Screw it all... I went  urlLink glam , I plan on hitting the pit and stage diving at up coming shows... I'm gonna keep doing crazy shit I like rollerblading when drunk, and wearing band t-shirts.  Yesterday was cool though. The CTB conference was alright. Barrio was cool. Oh yea... I watched  Kill Bill vol. 1  w/ Melissa yesterday too. Then I ordered some late night stromboli... mmm... massive log of dough filled with meat and veggies.  ***

      [16214]  Now playing:  urlLink Weezer  - Blue Album Deluxe Edition  I'm tired and I have a long day of supporting friends today. Inhye is doing a talk at a  urlLink conference  on campus this morning, also  urlLink Melissa  is doing a dance for PAL's Barrio. I hope I get a chance to take a nap this afternoon.  I have to do some reading for class Monday and I also want to get to work on one of my papers (which I will ultimately be presenting at a conference in October).  I'm looking forward to seeing Brand New next weekend and I'm thinking of having the potluck next Sunday... or perhaps the following one. Not sure yet. Who should I invite? Then I'm really looking forward to the Bouncing Souls show. That'll really rock. I'm gonna keep pestering people to go.  ***

      [16210]  I went to an 80s night thing tonight. It was fun. Good music and good company.   Anyway so today was a pretty lazy day as I went to the Belmar last night and ended up doing lots of late night chatting with friends. I pretty much lounged around at home until I went to campus around 7:30 PM to print out pictures of Bowie and other glam folks from the 80s for Melanie (my make up artist). We did a bunch of setting up around 8:15 and the acapella hit the stage around 9:30. Then there was an 80s cover band, a twister competition and a comedian. We ended up earning over $100 to be donated to the Salvation Army's music program. So it was quite a successful night.  Also Kristina, Jade, and I did some Twister at the end of the night, as we cleaned up.  Oh yea... pictures of me glam will eventually be uploaded.  I'm starving right now... it's times like these that I wish I actually ate snack food. I only had a cookie and a soda tonight.  Oh I haven't mentioned it here, but some of you know. I managed to get funding for next year. It's only a semester of funding, but it's something. So I'm renewing my lease with Hayes, and I have a flight booked. Life is looking pretty good... except for my little hard drive problem.  Well there's something else...  I'm just feeling somewhat displaced still.  I have another 2 years here probably, but my sense of home is not really existant. I really don't have anything stable in my life right now. I'm in California 4 months out of the year, hell I don't even have a set weekly schedule, I kind of wish I could have regular drinking buddies, etc. See.. when I was an undergrad, I had a set schedule of work and school. I had regular friends for doing stuff... drinking, going to shows, eating, museums, etc. Here everything is so sporadic and unorganized... even friendships kind of are. I have friends that I don't see or talk to in almost a month.   To be honest, I don't really like how the graduate student community is here. I'm not saying that people are bad, quite the contrary... in general people are pretty cool here. I just feel like there aren't people here with the same interests as I do. I feel more in touch with undergrads actually. However, I feel like I don't totally fit in with them, because I'm a graduate student. Tonight was different though... it was nicer.  ***

      [16198]  I'm in the POD and it is obvious that someone came in here who had been smoking weed.   I was just thinking about  urlLink Esther 's little story about how she won't give a guy a second date, because he listens to Dashboard Confessionals. I laughed and jokingly called her an indie snob. It's a funny story, but I think this is an example of the importance of subculture in regards to identity. I think that for the most part, if a girl didn't have similar tastes in music... it would be highly unlikely that I'd be attract to her. (Unlikely, but not impossible.) The reason for this is that music for the most part is what subcultural lines are drawn around and when it comes down to chosing someone to date, you want someone that you have stuff in common with.  Anyway so I asked Esther which she'd rather date - a moderate Republican or someone that listens to N*Sync. She chose the Republican, because she thought that political debates might be fun. I found that funny, so I posed the question to  urlLink Becky  and  urlLink Crystal  and they both said they'd choose the N*Sync guy. I guess for them, politics (which is subcultural as well) overrided musical tastes. I think for me, I'm with Esther on that question. I really enjoy good political debates, or friendly debates over whatever. I think that keeps you on your toes, and I think a good partner should do that. My opinion is that someone who is too much the same as you is scary. However, a moderate Republican is a big difference from those Bible-thumping militaristic conservatives that control Bush... that's a Republican I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.  In regards to race... I doesn't matter, but I think that the comments of certain people come across strange. For example,  urlLink Laine  (who's Asian) has joked on several occasions that I seem to only date / like Asians. I don't know, about that... but that's somewhat in a similar vein as Nick's "go interracial relationships!" comment (he's white). I don't like the whole specifically choosing someone to date based on race thing, because it comes across as creepy and these things always have racial-gender biases. For example my buddy Stephanie (an Asian) has always made it pretty well known that she doesn't date Asian guys. I don't know how to feel about comments like that whenever she makes them in my prescence, because I always think about the social construction of race and gender for Asian males. See M. Butterfly by David Henry Hwang or the  Details  magazine and Whitney McNally's article "Gay or Asian?"   However, going full circle, how many Asians like the things that my friends and I like? If subculture and music are important attributes for attraction to the opposite sex, and very few Asians like punk, indie rock, leftist politics, history, sociology, etc. then it complicates things more.  ***

      [16197]  Did some TV watch'in last night... The plot thickens on  urlLink The O.C. ... and the  urlLink Michael Jackson  skit on Southpark last night had me chuckling. I was amused with his repeating of "It's ignorant... it's ignorant." Chapelle show was good too. They showed the hardcore Wayne Brady skit again. "Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?" I also enjoyed Chapelle on jury selection. Haha... digital pee!  Ok so last night after enjoying some good entertainment on Comedy Central and a margarita, I decided to go rollerblading. I discovered that rollerblading, tequila, and lack of skills doesn't mix. I crashed into a dumpster, a fence, and a rock. I was so damn sore this morning.  If there's anything that  urlLink Bush  has a crappy record on, it's the environment. Not that Democrats don't kiss corporate polluter ass, but Bush as an oil man directly tied to some major polluters.  urlLink Arnold  on the other hand, I believe cares about the environment (somewhat), but not at the expense of his own fun.   ***

      [16192]  "A shout out to all my peeps, I'll be back in a few weeks" -Albert to Steff last night  Yea I booked a flight home and I'll be back on the evening of May 13th. BJs or D&B for happy hour anyone?   Someone on  urlLink xanga  commented on one of my posts that Iraq is essentially the same as Vietnam. I would totally disagree with this based on body counts of American soldiers, and the level of military mobilization. This is due to the lack of a draft and the fact that a good chunk of our armed forces are scattered in military bases around the world. However, I do think that Vietnam and Iraq are useful analogies. The "War on Terrorism" is an ideological battle not unlike the Cold War, and Iraq is the physical manifestation of the conflict of ideas and beliefs. It is the American government once again intervening on behalf of democracy, justice, and capitalism.  Inhye and I went up to Ithaca (Cornell Art Musuem) today, because she needed to see a video on  urlLink Nikki S. Lee 's work for a paper. I think the work of Nikki Lee is fascinating; however, I think I'm much for critical of it than Inhye. A big part of my criticism comes from the fact that in terms of subculture, my own self identification makes me think that her posing as a certain types of people does not say anything about the fluidity of identity, culture, and space. Yes her pictures of her being punk, hip-hop, yuppie, skater, etc. are convincing as stills, but what about issues of authenticity? She challenges authenticity on one level, but at the same time she reaffirms authenticity in terms of stereotype and perception. Inhye and I actually disagree on a lot of theory. It gets funny when we discuss spaces of restiance... but I'll save that discussion for another day.  Ok I need to run my partition program overnight, 'cause it takes f*cking forever!!!  Hmm... what should I make for dinner?  ***

      [16180]  Wow so the Bouncing Souls show is a  urlLink Rock Against Bush  show. So I guess that means that  urlLink NOFX , Alkaline Trio, and Jello Biafra in Irvine was the west coast part of the tour and this will be the east coast part. I really look forward to seeing Randy and their Swedish socialist rock goodness.  So I had the brilliant idea that it might be cool to format my hard drive and reinstall Windows since it was running super slow. However, when I was doing it, I accidently screwed up the partition on my external drive (with all my MP3s). The files are still recoverable, but I just need to get a program that fixes partitions...  At least my computer  is  running faster.  According to Brandon, parts of my last post will be turned into the song "Ticking Away." Maybe I should make more posts that use big words, so that he can turn them into Graffin-esque songs. Some big words that I like are epistemology, nomothetic, idiographic, teleology, manifestation, materialism, um... what else?  My family has never been into doctors, despite when I was really young... them encouraging me to be one. However this  urlLink story . Cracks me up... I could totally see myself doing something like that. However, I'm sure there's a lack of doctors in Iraq with stuff like  urlLink this  happening all the time. I'm not super activist or anything, but the lack of medical expertise in many parts of the world is scary. The fact that they have to airlift people in remote locations to the nearest big city for surgery must be a realy bitch.  Ok I better get on that write up for today's class readings now.  **

      [16159]   I've been waking up early the past few days... and I totally feel a difference. I think the early wake ups have been a result of the changing   urlLink weather  . The sunshine is waking me up. I should rollerblade or run in the morning as it's been a while since I've done either. Humidity also makes sleeping in less comfy.  The past few posts have just been a manifestation of so many frustrations. The semester is about 3 weeks away from being over, and I just want to get away from here. I'm not happy with the work I've done this semester, I'm frustrated not knowing about funding (still!), the whole being sucked into the shit talking nature of this school makes me not happy with myself, the lack of   urlLink beer   in the apartment depresses me, not knowing when I'll be home is making me antsy,   urlLink US Airways   changing how they run flights to John Wayne Airport is really horrible, and there are worries about finding a summer job.  I was thinking of having a little potluck brunch in the near future at my place... food is something that is good...  Here is something that has to do with some issues of my papers... the idea of truth in media in regards to something like the reporting on things going on in   urlLink Iraq   parallels how I talk about the real and unreal aspects of media. Indeed media is generally skewed; however, that doesn't mean its all bullsh*t. Something to think about how there is such a thing as material reality. There are motivations that drive resitance to the American occupation of Iraq which are grounded in material realities... one of those realities is the reality that people are dying. Feelings are very real things to people, despite the socially constructed desires, and ideologies that frame those feelings. From there real people physically act within the world. Bringing this full circle of course is once again the representation of action in media. There is dialectic or feedback loop between the real and the unreal.  Humidity makes me want to shower like every 20 minutes...  **

      [16148]   I've been up since 7:30 AM... pretty early for me... I got some stuff done, but not the stuff I should get done. I have 9 (1 and 8) pages of writing to work on. At least the 8 pages are only rough draft writing. I also have prepare 2 presentations for tomorrow.  I want to ramble a bit more about my life here and where I'm headed. Something that's really bothered me is how much I've been sucked into this culture of gossiping and talking shit here. The other day I heard a professor make the first negative comment I'd ever heard made about another professor. However, the comment was on how this other professor talks behind people's backs. To a certain extent it's not much of a criticism, because we all talk about people.  Personally I think there's a big difference between talking shit and voicing opinions. I used to be critical of people, but at the same time I do insert mentions of a person's good qualities. I might go on a rant about how so-and-so is a bitch, but be like there were times when she was cool. I've noticed I'm veering toward the whole talking shit thing. I'm going beyond being critical of people, and I'm just being an ass in how I present people.  What made me realize this is several recent conversations. One in particular is that I was telling a friend (#1) what another a friend (#2) said. Friend #1 said friend #2 seemed like an ass, and then I had to backtrack and bring up friend #2's good qualities. The irony is that when I've mentioned some of the things friend #1 has said and done, friends have said bad things about her too. Then I end up defending her too.  I don't think my defense of my friends takes away the guilt of presenting them in a negative light to begin with. It's one thing to be critical, which is natural... but it's another thing to convince other people that a friend is a bad person (even temporarily).  ***

      [16140]   I’ve been writing a lot the past 24 hrs… not necessarily stuff for my classes, but just sort of random rambles about a variety of different things - insecurities, annoyances, hopes, etc. In the rambling is a lot of soul searching about the direction I’m going in life.    Advice I would give to a friend in my shoes would be that every moment that you live, you are learning and therefore redefining who you are and where you’re headed. I would say what you want in life now will evolve, so just go with the flow. However, that doesn’t solve the problem of my future near and far being so devoid of clearly identifiable objects.   I feel so displaced; I don’t know where I belong physically, intellectually, and emotionally. I have no sense of home, I have no idea about my career, and I don’t know how I feel about life in general. Nothing is bad, but nothing is good either. It’s an annoying feeling.  The only thing in my future that I’m pretty sure about is that I’ll get my phd; however, what does that mean? Will I find a job? If I do where will I live? And what does this mean for my relationships with friends and family? What will all this mean to me as an individual?   I’ve gone on rants about trying to figure out who I am before, so I’ll leave it to the archives to do all the work. Something different about how I’m feeling right now is this concern for my current liminality and the prospect that it’ll never go away. I remember when I visited my cousin Kathy and her husband Eric and their friends talked about the nature of academia. Things like moving around a lot, long distance relationships, money issues, politics and career decisions scare the shit out of me.   I don’t like thinking that I won’t have a sense of home until I get tenure somewhere, which might not even be a place amenable to my personality. I don’t like thinking that it’ll become harder and harder to hang out with close friends. I don’t like thinking that my love life past, present, and future would be very different if I chose a field that didn’t have me all over the place. I don’t like thinking that I will have to play political games to ensure financial and career stability.  It’s the potential of things not really changing, and me never escaping the confines of my rut.   **

      [16127]  “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood… a beautiful day in the neighborhood… would you be mine? Could you be mine?” – Mr. Rogers  Indeed it was a beautiful day the past 2 days in the neighborhood. Not a cloud in the sky and I burned myself a new CD. Sunshine and music are two powerful things that can really change your mood. I think that without this break in the gloom, I would have really started to go insane (more so than usual that is). Today is a bit more gloomy, but at least the temperature is nice.  I don’t know if y’all have noticed, but my regular blog and my xanga have been slightly different in their posts. I guess I’m trying to be a little different in my two pages. I think, though, that I like the current look of my   urlLink xanga   enough that I’ll implement some of the visual aspects to my blog: namely pictures, more red coloring, and bolder text. I think that things just stand out more on my xanga, whereas my blog looks kind of bland.  I saw  Kill Bill vol. 2  yesterday with some professor types. I haven’t seen vol. 1 yet… oh well I knew I should of rented it, but I guess I’ll just watch ‘em backwards. I get the feeling I would have appreciate vol. 2 more if I had seen vol. 1. Oh well...  We caught a matinee showing and went over to the  urlLink  Ale House  . Mmmm.... beer, pizza, pretzels, nuts and buzzed chatting about stuff. Despite being on the expensive side, I've come to the conclusion that I'm liking the Ale House more. Of course the fact that they played The Offspring's "Spare Me The Details" and Bad Religion's "Recipe for Hate" last night probably boosted my impression of the place.  I have to write 12 pages by Monday... whoo! Yea I didn't get anything done the past few days.  ***

      [16114]  When your favorite band ( Bad Religion ) lets you down with their upcoming release, it's kind of sad and depressing. It makes me wanna drown my sorrows with a bottle of Jack. I realize they had nowhere else to go but down after  Process of Belief . That album IS one of my favorite albums of all time. Well the European version anyway, the American version lacks "Shattered Faith." In truth a lot of my favorite bands have let me down recently. I guess it's because most of the bands I really like are in decline after being around for decades.  I still have no clue about my future, which is a let down as well. Well at least I have an idea of what classes I want to take.  Not a lot else to say. I've been a slacker as of late. Stay up late, waking up late... not working on goals I set for myself... that sort of thing. Jade had a point, when she was talking about life with no structure. I really need to find a job and take some classes this summer. That'll keep me on task better. At least I managed to get 2 pages of writing done today. So I have 8 out of 20 pages completed. So that means I need to write 12 pages in 4 days. It's do-able...  Oh yea I want to wish a happy b-day to my homeboy Kaho and to my buddy Crystal... As my time zone currently straddles their two birthdays.  ***

      [16105]  So last night I went out to eat with Kazuhiro, Chi-Wei, and Chi-Wei's wife and 1 year old daughter. I got nice and stuffed on decent Japanese food. Then I got back home and let   urlLink Melissa   crash at my place. The silly girl didn't realize that her dorms didn't open until today, so she was homeless. She, as a source of amusement, was once again a target for me and my Sharpie pen. I wanted to write "homeless" on her forehead, but she woke up with only "ho" written on her. I'm such a good friend huh?  Anyway I managed to get some writing done for my paper on Hong Kong. Writing about diaspora is complicated stuff. For example the fact that Hong Kong and Taiwan are the result of complicated migrations of Chinese people in themselves, it gets even more complicated in regards to cinema. The production of Chinese movies in these places were very much affected by Chinese populations in Southeast Asia and the United States. So I'm trying to capture the ephermality when it comes to the idea of a "national" cinema, for a borderless population. I guess that's why there are whole books on writing about diaspora.  I guess this brings into the question of identity for immigrant populations, which is something that my friends and I have been talking about lately. As Rey Chow writes, a way of dealing with diaspora is, "to  unlearn  that submission to one's ethnicity such as 'Chineseness' as the ultimate signified." (page 25 of  Writing Diaspora ). Chow doesn't say that one's background is to be ignored, but at the same time she doesn't think something like being Chinese is an all encompassing and total experience.  Anyway... I'm thinking of reworking some of the CSS on my page. So that my representation of self in cyberspace is changed a bit. We'll see...  ***

      My days have been ending and thus getting started quite late since I've gotten back from DC. I woke up today around 12:30 PM and then went out rollerblading (Day #6). That meant that I didn't get to lunch until 3:00 PM since I had to shower and make my lunch. At least I managed to back up some of my files on CD,   urlLink upload pics  , and take out the trash. At least I managed to get a page of writing done last night (after hours of playing Civ III though). I have a lot of work I need to get done in the next week. I have to write about 11 more pages for my art history class and 5 for my sociology class by next Monday. Lovely huh?  In other news... apparently Brand New is going to be playing here in Binghamton in a few weeks. I should really read the school paper and keep aware of what goes on campus. I actually got news of this from Becky, who doesn't even go to school here (although she is friends with Melissa who does go here) Anyway... I'm still annoyed that I didn't get to hear Greg Graffin of Bad Religion talk here last year. I need to keep up with stuff in Binghamton.  Speaking of shows... I still don't know which date of the Bouncing Souls, Randy, and Avail show that I want to go to. I've already seen the Bouncing Souls and Avail, but I've never seen Randy. They're a band I really want to see. I find their Marxist lyrics humorous. So... 5/5 in Buffao, 5/6 in New York, or 5/7 in Philadelphia?  In a more political vein... I don't see how people could not have forseen this sort of thing going into war. Pro-war people were talking about how easy it would be to topple Saddam Hussein's government, but those same people didn't think about how complicated the situation would be following Saddam's defeat. I don't see how the Bush Administration with billions of dollars of intelligence research didn't realize that occupying a nation is difficult stuff (especially in a region of the world that hates Americans).  ***

      [16096]  The funny thing is that I was telling Nick about  urlLink Crystal  the other night. I guess my impressions of what she was thinking was just about right.  I'm from Irvine, and I don't think anything of people... much less Asians dressing punk. Then again I'm just one person out of the hundreds or even thousands that stare or think. To say that identity is socially constructed is theoretically sound, but that doesn't mean that the implications of the social construct doesn't have  actual  impacts on how people act and react to things. I had a debate about this with Inhye, and I argued that there is a real and unreal component to indentity. Ultimately it doesn't matter whether something exists in objective reality or if is a manifestation of our collective "imaginations," because we as individual subjects have feelings that in turn affect how we act in the material world.  That sounds like something pulled out of  Waking Life , which I saw with the girls last week. Good movie that I need to rent one of these days. There are a lot of movies I want to rent in the next week or so. I still need to see  Kill Bill  and  School of Rock .  Not a lot done today. Just rollerblading and cooking.  I am, however, annoyed with the breaking of many things.  The zipper on my nice leather jacket (purchased in 2001) broke off, and it has a tear in it. I'll probably get a new jacket as a result. My Swiss watch stopped ticking (purchased in 2001). I need to get it fixed this summer in LA. I dropped my coffee pot (purchased in 2002). A measuring cup (purchased a month ago). I think I'll make pizza for dinner now.  ***

I think zombies are making a comeback... with movies like Resident Evil and 28 Days Later.   After the movie I got thoroughly buzzed / drunk at the Ale House. Lots of intellectual rambling along with cheese and crackers.  Today I managed to get 3 pages of writing done and mailed some stuff.  Coffee is brewing...  ***

      [16085]   Call me a commie, call me a hypocrite, call me a bleeding heart liberal... but my middle class and suburban friends really annoy me with their superficial materialism, faux liberal attitudes, and belief in social mythologies sometimes.  I know I'm technically one of them. Just look at how I live, what I eat, and where I come from... but at least I realize that things such as clothes, cars, and capitalism aren't necessarily good things in our society. Nor do I believe in the general idea of a meritocractic society.  I'll never understand paying more than $25 for a shirt, buying fast cars when there are speed limits, eating out in fancy restaurants, and buy lots of  things . I'm not an ascetic monk-type person, but I simply don't get how people let the materialism and consumerism of our society affect them. I mean people buy all sorts of worthless junk, and then bitch about not having money. People eat expensive and unhealthy foods, then bitch about being fat. People buy gas guzzling cars and then bitch about gas prices. Where's the logic?  In all this they think pure capitalism is a good thing. They think that in a capitalist system, that working hard will get them to the level of Bill Gates? Nevermind the fact that the crappier jobs require harder work for less pay! Then these people criticize the poor for not being as successful as them. Nevermind the fact that you would have had to work many times harder if your parents didn't cover so many of your expenses.  I dunno... I just feel like some people are ignorant sometimes.  ***

Paella is good stuff. The Washington Monument seems smaller than in pictures. The Capitol seems bigger than in pictures. How can anyone go to the various memorials in D.C. and feel war is a good thing? Sandwiches galore! Sangria is great too. Sing-a-long with the Darkness can hurt your throat. Walking is exercise. I want to use the Library of Congress's reading room. Cherry blossoms are pretty. Harry Potter 1 is a good movie. Homemade pizookies are fun. NIH is quite a labryinth. Geese take large dumps. A bar, coffee shop, and bookstore in 1!? I touched a moon rock!  Good times with my Cambridge buddies. So Chicago next time around?  Ok time for lunch, and then I'll call Nick to see if he still wants to see Hellboy.  ****

      [16066]  I think it might be due to the coming of spring and the reality of summer being right around the corner, but a lot of my female friends have been concerned with losing weight lately. At least 3 friends in the past week have talked about this. I can't help but feel concerned about this mentality.  From a linguistic and psychological level, I think the term "losing weight" is extremely problematic. Men and women don't really mean "losing weight" as much as getting in shape. However, because the term "losing weight" is the verbal standard for conveying the idea of getting in shape, being fit, gaining tone, etc. it has implications on how people set their fitness goals. The problem with this is weight does not necessarily imply fitness. One can gain the appearance of fitness, without shedding pounds, since you might be replacing fat with muscle (which is heavier). This contradiction is no doubt one of the reasons why people do unhealthy things to reach their goals.  The concept of "losing weight" is a sensitive issue for me, because in high school I had to cut weight for wrestling. My off season weight was around 125 lbs, but my junior and senior years I competed at 103 lbs. Losing weight helped me win the league title at my weight class, but in retrospect I do think that what I did was borderline anorexic. On one hand, I have no sympathy for people who bitch about being "fat" when they don't do anything about it, and on the other hand it bothers me when people don't get in shape in a healthy fashion.  I'm just think of all this, since I'm making cookies right now.  ***

I just threw out some junk mail and random papers. I also straighted up my stacks of papers and books. I'll have to check out the vacuum cleaner later.  I'm also getting laundry done.   I'm going to have to go to campus to run some quick errands too such as get stamps....  Yay going to D.C. tomorrow!  ***

      I’ve been watching a lot of movies lately. In the month of May I’ve watched  A Better Tomorrow ,  The One ,  Iron Monkey ,  Ichi the Killer ,  Shrek 2 ,  Van Helsing ,  The Triplets of Bellville ,  School of Rock ,  From Hell ,  Eurotrip ,  Reign of Fire ,  The Rundown  and  The Last Samurai . These are all movies that I’ve seen for the first time, and for the most part all these movies were good. (Ichi the Killer was just extremely disturbing.) I watched a Japanese movie recently called  Versus , that was cool despite starting off slow.     I also saw the season finale of   The O.C.   via download. I really like that show and its So Cal references. As Derek commented, working at the beach is so  The O.C.  Let’s see ifanything interesting happens this summer.     I really want my schedule for work settled so that I know if I can see  Anti-Flag  at the Roxy.&nbsp;     So like I went drinking with the Posse (Derek, Jon, Andy) at the  Newport Brewing Co.  It was good times. Then we hung out at my place for some more beer.&nbsp;I kind of want the Lakers to lose in the finals... riots!!! LA is so about rioting.

      [16521]  Something I was just thinking about is the issue of freedom to information. Something talked about recently is the issue of images of fallen soldiers and of the Abu Ghraib prison. Should images and information about these things be made public?   There is also the issue of the Bush Administration doing their best to prevent the disclosure of government information as mandated by the Freedom of Information Act.   Information is something that is strictly controlled in our society by transnational corporations and a conservative government. The irony is that our political system is based on democratic and meritocratic principles, this means information is essential to the citizenry making rational decisions.  This is not something that applies just as much to everyday decisions as it does to a nation’s sovereignty. If a friend doesn’t give you clean information this will affect your decisions. Most people act based on the knowledge given to them.   But on some issues, is it better to know or not know?  Yes this is a ramble…  ***

      [16507]  I feel so content and satisfied for the most part here in California. I don’t have the weird uncomfortable vibe of life in Binghamton. Here I feel like I’m myself both in spirit and in being. Orange County is home for me, and it’s nice to know where stuff is… well the fact that there actually is stuff here is really cool. I’ll be spending a good chunk of the summer working at a coffee shop down in Laguna Beach… so the scent of ocean air and fresh coffee (two wonderful scents) will saturate my clothes with pleasantness.   I went to the  urlLink UCI Pub  last night with  urlLink Alex  and Brandon. Good times… afterwards, Brandon and I got some  urlLink Del Taco  and watched Conan.   John McCain was on Conan and it’s kind of a shame he shot down the idea of running with Kerry. While I don’t agree with everything the guy does, he’s not the dipshit that Kerry and Bush come across as. If Kerry wins, he’ll probably be a puppet just like Bush. Although, Kerry probably won’t be controlled by nuts like Cheney, Rumsfield, etc.  I like what  urlLink Gore  said the other day about those people in the Bush administration. Why didn’t he show these kind of balls when running for president?  I was talking to  urlLink Esther  the other day about how it’s the lesser of two evils in these elections.  Blondie was on Kilborn… the band can still play good stuff, but man does Debbie Harry look old. It was weird seeing her try to move her arms to show she’s still got energy.   ***

      [16487]  Nothing productive lately. I haven’t done any reading except reading the paper in the morning. Been working out (jogging and light lifting) at least.   urlLink $191 billion  for war in Afghanistan and Iraq. That’s a fucking mind boggling amount. That’s enough to cover tuition for every one of the  urlLink 16.5 million college students  in the country for a year. Sad huh?  Things  urlLink like this  are sad. It’s one of many examples of media consolidation and the interlocking nature of corporate power. People talk about the pluralism of the hundreds of media outlets, but what good is it when Viacom, Disney, AOL Time Warner, ClearChannel, etc. own all these outlets and make deals with corporations like Nike, McDonalds, etc. Possibly the only thing that challenges the monopolism of TV and radio is the Internet. However, it doesn’t help that Microsoft is always  urlLink expanding …   These aren’t happy posts are they?  Well anyway I’ve got job training tomorrow… I get to look forward to a summer of coffee and ocean air!   ***

      [16468]  Leave comments people!  Alas Shooters in Costa Mesa shut down, and there is no longer Quilmes at Vons. Last night was a night of disappointment for the Posse (Derek & Jon). We ended up having Jamaican and  urlLink Czech beer  while we watched wrestling and  urlLink Adult Swim  with Heather. It was some good hanging out, despite the odd tasting beer.  I was thinking last night... the most flattering thing I’ve heard in recent times is how Cissa said something along the lines of wanting to be best of friends with whatever girl I end up dating. This is coming from someone who wanted me date her sister a year ago. As much drama as that suggestion caused last summer, and she has expressed her regret about causing a big stir… I still feel extremely honored that she made such a suggestion (despite the somewhat bad outcome), and continues to make suggestions about the significance of my life in relation to hers.   I didn't run this morning, I think I'll do an afternoon run today.  I need to get reading done today.  ***

      [16443]  So I was watching some of  urlLink Bush 's speech on Iraq. It bothered me in how Bush used words like terror(ism), freedom, economic liberalism, etc. His words reminded me of this poem: Take up the White Man's burden-- In patience to abide, To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride; By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain, To seek another's profit And work another's gain. It's no wonder people say this was a urlLink  colonial war . I was telling some friends last night that it sucks that a vote for Kerry won't necessarily change this foreign policy. We're stuck dealing with Iraq, and it'll loom over American international politics for a long time.  I went out for a jog and lifted weights this morning, but I was fatigued for some reason. I think it might be due to a week of crappy eating.  ***

      [16410]  I had a scare this morning as my laptop wouldn't turn on righ away...  Ok for some reason I'm addicted to this  urlLink Alkaline Trio  song "Warbrain" on the  Rock Against Bush  compilation. Actually I've been listening to Alkaline Trio quite a bit recently. I think they're one of the few bands who can do songs about women and love without sounding sappy and lame. It's probably the dark imagery they employ.  I saw this Japanese movie called  Ichi the Killer  yesterday and it had THE MOST FUCKED UP SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'm pretty fucked up myself... the other that I made the following comment to my friend: "I kind of want to email my 6th grade teacher and say 'You fat bitch, I'm surprised diabetes or other fat related diseases didn't kill you off already.'" Yes, I can make comments like that, but seeing a girl get her nipples sliced off, a guy hanging from a bunch of hooks in his flesh and another guy sticking knitting needles through him, rape, stuff I think was cum dripping and lots of dismembering was really pushing it for me. This ranks up there with  8 mm , but this movie because of a weird plot about gangsters, brainwashing, sadism and masochism made things worse. At least 8 mm had some sort of coherent plot?  Oh by the way, I put up pictures of my cleaned, redecorated, rearranged room.  Before (May 2001):    [image]    After (May 2004):    [image]     [image]    Ok so what should I do today?  ***

      [16383]  Oh man there was this ad before  Shrek 2  at the Regal / United Artists theater in Cerritos that totally did a butchering of the Beach Boys' 'California Girls.' Anyway I went out to dinner (Red Robbin)with the girls (Steff, Julia, and Janet) and watched Shrek 2. It was a fun movie. I think I liked the first one overall, but this one had some good moments. I also loved the soundtrack. In the scene I was all like... "wait a minute... hmm... THAT'S A COVER OF THE BUZZCOCKS!"  Earlier in the day, I had an interview at Dietrichs in Laguna Beach. It went ok. Man it was such a nice day for a drive down to Laguna via the 133 and along PCH (on my way home). It was so beautiful and it just felt so nice seeing the Pacific Ocean again. I was thinking about all the colors that made the landscape so vibrant. The naturally ochre and tan shades of the plant life juxtaposed against blue green of the ocean. Thinking about colors makes me want to paint. I should hang with  urlLink Cissa  or  urlLink Crystal  and see if either want to go to the  urlLink Art Supply Warehouse  sometime.  I've been waking up later now. So that means less activity. I also need to read.  ***

      [16376]  Went to D&B with George last night... had some vodka and redbull and didn't sleep until 2 AM.  Things I've been up to...  Eating lots of junk food. I'm too happy about the lack of vegetables in this house. It's ironic. I eat crap here in California, but I exercise a lot. In Binghamton, I eat super healthy, but I sit on my ass all day. For most people, home means good healthy food... not here. I should go get some fresh veggies and make lunch before my job interview in the afternoon.  Been watching DVDs lately too...  Enter the Dragon  and  Reign of Fire .  I got  urlLink EndNote . I entered in my bibliography for my  Planet of the Apes  paper and I'm going to play with it a bit more. I think it can be an extremely useful program. Now if only I was a programmer... I'd expand it beyond a bibliographic database, to something that can cross reference actual notes. Like you can click on a hyperlink for Walter Benjamin and you can pull up your personal notes on readings.  The past 2 days I've also been re-ripping all my CDs... (and brother's). No more of this 128 kbps or lower crap.  Am I productive? Or not? I don't feel productive.  Today I'm hanging out with Cambrige girls and watching  Shrek 2 .  ***

      An amusing conversation. [02:37:32 PM] Me: hmm I'm reading a book and there's a garment factory in Indonesia called Kaho Indah Citra [02:37:46 PM] Kaho: haha...oh no [02:37:55 PM] Kaho: im a slave driver [02:38:00 PM] Me: yea the workers went on strike [02:38:01 PM] Me: hehe [02:38:08 PM] Kaho: damn them, hehe [02:38:47 PM] Me: "The issue for the Kaho workers, who earn the equivalent of US$2 per day, was that they were being forced to work long hours of overtime but weren't being paid the legal rate for their trouble." [02:39:39 PM] Kaho: haha...kaho workers... [02:39:46 PM] Kaho: yes im so cheap [02:39:47 PM] Kaho: and evil [02:40:09 PM] Me: well you're the product of British Imperialism... [02:42:01 PM] Me: yes and that ideal still lives on, inside of sweatshops  [02:47:16 PM] Andy Clymer: damn, kaho has a sweatshop? [02:47:23 PM] Andy Clymer: jeez, thats why we never see him [02:49:08 PM] Kaho Lo: haha [02:49:08 PM] Kaho Lo: u guys ***

      [16363]  I was just thinking about a lot of things and how they all relate to something Minh-An mentioned in her presentation. It's the idea / belief in a just world.  When you read about stuff like  urlLink this , or more  urlLink people dying , or watching the DVD on the  urlLink Rock Against Bush  compilation. It's hard to believe that there is karma / a just world. It's not just these distant events around the world. I can think of my everyday interactions with people. For some reason people tell me about the very bad things that have happened in their lives. This is both strangers and close friends... I hear about how people have done bad things to them, how they got hit with life threatening disease, about horrible accidents, losses, pain, anger, etc. Sometimes the weight of hearing these breaks me down. It's especially hard when you hear of these from people you really care about. Sometimes you wonder why all these things afflict people you care about, and you've mostly lived a damage free life.  **

      [16358]  Yesterday we got DSL and our home network up and running. Yep that's right DSL. It's funny, when we moved into this house in 1996... we knew that there were cat5 cables built into the walls and a hub in the closet of the master bedroom. We haven't taken advantage of it until now, we even had a cable modem for a few years as well. I guess it was a bitch to go from room to room and figure out which cable went to which jack. It took me about 2 hrs to do that on Sunday afternoon. Anyway, so  urlLink Stan  and I spent the afternoon doing that.  After that, I more or less went to go and hang out with  urlLink Crystal . We went to various places so I could check out frames for my diplomas, and then we ate at El Cholo. It was funny, because we got there just as the manager was locking the front doors at 9. He let us in though. Our waitress was a bit frustrated that we were let in, and she didn't hide it. She wasn't overtly rude, but it was obvious they wanted us out of there.  Anyway so I woke up this morning around 6:30 AM and went for a 2 mile run. I haven't done that particular route since high school (when I was cutting weight). I started feeling nauseous when I was on Meadowwood though. Afterwards, I did some light lifting, made breakfast for my dad and Stan, and watched  The Rundown .  I feel productive as of late, but alas the productivity isn't directed toward things I feel are important... things such as reading, writing and possibly artwork. I'm going to go to the grocery store a bit later and probably pick up frames for my diplomas. I'm going to  try  to finish that Amin and Thrift book today.  ***

      [16354]  Ah... been up since 6:15 AM and I've already... rollerbladed, lifted weights, installed Adobe Photoshop, surfed the web, made breakfast, and read the paper. Productivity! I like it!  Something I miss doing, that I only really do here at home is read the paper. A real physical copy of it anyway. It's something that just seems to work really well with breakfast or other meals. I'm not really a fan of the  urlLink OC Register  though. It always feels 2 days behind the internet, but it's nice having the sheets of paper laid out on the table infront of me as I eat my scrambled eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns. If I knew how to do it, I think it'd be cool to have a subscription to a UK paper, or even French one. I think though... when tablet PCs get to a really cheap and convienent form, that would really replace having a real newspaper.  So today I think I might call up a temp company to try to get a job and maybe join a gym. I think I also need some new summer clothes, but I hate clothing shopping.  ***

      I just watched  The Last Samurai . It was a good movie. I want to reflect on some of the  urlLink comments  I said before I watching it, as well as comments  urlLink Crystal  made.  The movie essentially deals with an underlying issue within colonialism and postcolonialism. That issue is the idea of modernity. The Meiji Restoration (1868) was an attempt to circumvent Western imperialism, by essentially becoming Western. In this process that did things like adopt a Western-style constitution (1889), build Western-style buildings, and end the samurai warrior class (by 1876). I believe the movie takes place between 1875-1877.  It's a complicated issue, because if it weren't for these modernization attempts by Japan, it could have become like China. In the 1840s China had already lost cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong to the British. These changes allowed Japan to rise to the status of a world power (and colonial power) by the turn of the century instead of being a colony.  The movie attempted to address the complicated issue of dealing with modernity without losing a sense of identity. The maintenance of the imperial line in the "restoration" and the use of it for the legitmacy in the new government was essential. The idea of  kokutai  implemented through out the constitution essentially made the government a constitutional theocracy. This was a tie to tradition.  Crystal is right in saying that the movie show how the ultimate result is modern Western ways winning, which sucks. However, it is an unfortunate reality. I actually applaud the movie for trying to deal with the complexities. But, I don't like how they made this a purely Japanese issue. They made it about shady Japanese officials versus the noble savage (in Crystal's words). They don't talk about why the Japanese wanted to modernize... it's like they avoid the idea that all of this is because of Western Imperialism. Maybe it's because the US was engaged in an imperialism war when it was released?   Another criticism is how only Tom Cruise gets the happy ending at the end. He lives and he gets the Japanese woman in the end. Why does he get to live? I would have been more powerful if he had died with Ken Watanabe on the battlefield, because that would have really showed how the idea of  bushido  changed his life. As  urlLink Roger Ebert  put it, "his shift is visceral, not ideological." Also does it imply Cruise is the last samurai? Because all the Japanese protagonists die! In the end, the part with the official and the Emperor is rather dull. So it's not really revealed if the lesson of tradition and identity is absorbed...  ***

      [16343]   urlLink Indie 103.1  is playing "Los Angeles is Burning" right now. When the opening chords and vocals hit, I couldn't help but feel a feeling of joy come over me. I think that I felt that, because it's a song about So Cal and I'm happy to be back.  Speaking of  urlLink Bad Religion , I did some rearranging of my room yesterday. I moved a lot of my furniture and stuff around... including posters. It looks like I have a Bad Religion wall now. Actually that side of the room is the rowdy Albert side.  Wow...  urlLink Flogging Molly 's "The Likes of You Again" is playing now. Good music! So Cal has awesome radio. Indie 103.1 might be owned buy a subsidiary of Clear Channel, but it's one of the best stations I've ever heard. It was playing some Sham 69 the other night!  I really like the new set up for my room. It's much more roomy and it helps that I threw out a lot of junk. So I feel less surrounded by crap. I want to pay either Target or Rite Aid a visit for some cheapo frames. I wonder if I should walk to Rite Aid or if I should see if my old bike still works  Today I pretty much just plan on relaxing and reading. Maybe do some drawing or painting?  ****

      [16337]  I've been up since 6 AM... I'm still on eastern time. Last night I went drinking with  urlLink Alex  and I was super tired when I got home. I went to sleep at 10.  It's an interesting thing. I've never managed to get straight A's until grad school. I had pretty crappy grades in elementary school. I had a 3.69 in high school, but that was a result of the AP class GPA bonus. I was mostly a B+ student in high school. As an undergrad I finished with a 3.405 GPA. There were a few quarters where I managed to get straight A-'s. So anyway, this semester I managed to get straight A's for the first time ever.   I simply just never really cared about grades or working hard. Then again working hard and effor is all relative to how much you enjoy what you're doing.   Oh yea I had an interesting conversation with  urlLink Esther  the other day... it went something like...  Me: I wasn't about to go asking all the Asian women if they knew an Esther. Or wait they probably do, there are a lot of Asian Esthers. Esther: Yea but all of them are 'azn' or Christian. Me: There was another Albert Fu at UCI that's the exact opposite of me... super Christian Me: These people besmirch our names. Speaking of Alex and Esther, it strikes me that they along with many of my good friends do artsy stuff. Those two along with  urlLink Andy ,  urlLink Cissa , Brandon, and others are all doing cool stuff. It makes me think I should get back into doing artsy stuff.  I'm going to UCI again this afternoon to see Minh-An's UROP presentation. I'm proud of her. I've known her for a few years now, despite us not hanging out much. She's an ambitious one.  ****

      [16330]  This morning I helped  urlLink Cissa  with her photography stuff and then went to UCI to check out books. I also paid Marc in the history department a visit. It feels nice to be in Irvine again… rolling down Culver Drv. and listening to KROQ’s 90s music flashback. The music and the campus made me forget about Binghamton for a while. It’s almost like the Albert that’s a grad student there was gone, and I was back to being the person who lived in Irvine for 17 years. The music of the 90s is the soundtrack to a good chunk of my life here. I couldn’t help but feel reminiscent of the past.   Last night it was cool hanging out with the posse (Derek, Jon, and Brandon) as well. At  urlLink BJ’s  I also ran into someone that was on my high school wrestling team that I hadn’t seen in years. Life is familiar here, because my life has a history here. This makes it so easy to let go of memories of Binghamton… 2500 miles away from here. There are familiar faces in Binghamton since it’s such a small place, but there’s no history to it. Life there has always been extremely liminal…   That’s not say that Irvine feels exactly the same as it did in the past, but memories are anchored to a long chain of events, and places.  ***

      I guess I have a bad attitude when I feel like someone is attacking my character. I admit that. I also admit that I should have known better about some stuff. If anything I apologize for trying to wake you up, when I was bored in the morning. I should know by now how you get when you’re tired and want to sleep. However, a lot of the other stuff you started, regardless if you knew what you were doing. This is not the first time you’ve done something like this. You weren’t the only one that got irritated and felt weird.

      Here I am on the plane, on my way home to LA / Irvine.  My battery really doesn’t hold charge anymore, so I don’t know how much more I can type. I need to get it replaced this summer, before my service plan expires. (Hmm… should I renew my plan?)  Ok so it says that battery is critical, but my computer has yet to turn off… so we’ll see how long this sucker can really last. I could be possible, that my laptop’s stupid and doesn’t know if there’s any juice in the batter or not.   It would be really cool though, if I got this problem solved earlier so that I can watch DVDs or something on my laptop. That’d be particularly cool on these cross country flights. I already slept 1 hr on the flight from Binghamton to Philadelphia, and then another 2 on this Philly to LA flight. The rest of the time I’ve been doing crossword puzzles and doodling in the complimentary magazine. There’s about an hour and a half left to this flight…  So in an hour and a half I’ll be back in California - the greatest state (directed at all those NY and PA people I know). I think the people who argue that NY only really use NYC as there point of reference. NYC is not representative of NY or any city in the world. When people call it the city, it really is THE city. LA is not the kind of city that most people think of when they think of cities. San Francisco maybe… Anyway… California has a more varied climate, population, economy, better schools, better bands, and hotter women. Oh man… Nancy’s gonna be posting some nasty comments when she reads this.  Inhye was laughing at me, because she was saying how obvious it was from the look on my face that I’m looking forward to going back to CA.   Something else… I’d like to point out that actions do not exist without a context. My actions come out of reactions.  My battery still seems to be working fine… after 15 minutes. Let’s see how long it’ll go!  The pilot just said we’ll be landing in about 1 hr.   I’m so excited about summer. I remember last year, I was happy about going home in the sense it was all about relief. It was about getting the hell out of Binghamton. This time around it’s not so much about getting out of Binghamton, as much as me being stoked about seeing friends, doing research, and lots of other stuff.

      [16310]  So yesterday Chi-Wei helped me move my stuff to his place for storage. We hung out for a bit and then I was home again to get some more cleaning done before Melissa came over to hang out.  It was nice hanging out with Melissa, as we made a pizza and just sat around chatting. We talked about all sorts of different things and reminisced about the year. There were a lot of revelations, sick jokes, and deep stuff in those conversations. It was sort of a somber end to the year, as Melissa was talking about how she’s sad the year is over. I can’t say that I’m sad the year is over. I’m actually happy and look forward to the future. There was one very serious thing that we talked about, that does make the future a bit scary. I can only hope that things end up okay. However, aside from that the summer and next school year are things I’m really looking forward to.  ****

       Pick up to 20 people from your friends list, say something anonymous to them. Don't say who it is, and don't reveal them unless they guess.   1. I remember when I first met you and I was all like… wow… there’s something special about this girl. I was right. Somehow our lives had intersected many times despite us not meeting until we were far away from our everyday lives. I know sometimes I can cross the line in joking around, but you are like almost a sister to me. You are also one of the few friends who is willing to not sugarcoat advice and tell me things I don’t want to hear.  2. This applies to 2 friends actually… You’re a friend I’ve known for most of my life. It’s amazing how long our friendship has gone on despite being away for school. You guys are my most trusted friends.  3. I’ve known you forever. We’ve been a tag team for most of our lives. If anything I do feel a regret that we don’t get to hang out like we used to (or cause the trouble that we used to). I've always been amazed at your talent and potential for great things. I just hope your dreams get realized.  4. In regards to you, I will always wonder if things would have been different if I didn’t go to school in NY. However, it was me being away and boredom in a new place that made me get back in touch in you. Getting in touch with you was totally worth it, and I know how I see the world would be different right now if we hadn’t gotten back in touch.  5. I’ve known you for a few years now and despite the distance that has always separated us, you have always been someone I feel I can trust and talk to. You’re definitely one of my closest friends, despite us never having hung out, toasted our drinks, and partied all night long.  6. I’ve known you for half my life, and if anything I’m sorry for how much we heckle you sometimes. It’s been ages since we last hung out or even chatted online. We should make up for lost time.  7. I don’t know what it was about you that instantly drew me to you and perhaps stills draws me in more than I should let it. Maybe it’s the fact that you are one the few people I feel like I can be completely myself around. I just feel comfortable when I’m around you. I look forward to the future.  8. You’re a friend who has never ceased to amaze me with your intellect, class, and niceness. If I had to say that anyone is perfect and good, it’d be you.   9. This applies to 2 people. You are a really good person, but I don’t know why you annoy me. Is it the questions you ask or your opinions? I feel guilty every time I get annoyed at something you do or say.   10. I haven’t known you very long (not quite a year), but you are an extremely intelligent young lady who has rare good taste in music. We’re just getting to know one another, and I look forward to knowing more.  11. I’ve known you for a few years now, and we don’t really hang out much. However, you’re almost like a little sister to me. When you email me and tell me about the stuff, I can’t help but be proud.  12. I’ve known you all my life, and I know I haven’t been the best person to you. For that I’m sorry. I can only hope that we can finally enjoy a beer together.  Ok that's it for now...

      [16302]  Food relates to everything:    Me: I'm always amused by how girls get potentials to chose from Stephanie from Santiago Hills: well i dont usually … Me: haha... but this time you got plently of good options in the buffet of love Me: it's like there are multiple prime rib stations instead of just 1 Stephanie from Santiago Hills: lol Stephanie from Santiago Hills: buffet of love Stephanie from Santiago Hills: thats funny Stephanie from Santiago Hills: while youre stuck at the taco bel of love... Me: haha Me: I'm more of the del taco person... if I was in the del taco of love, I'd be satisfied   Not a lot going on today. Just more cleaning and packing. Did some chatting with some friends online. I'm outta here in 2 more days!  I want to say that this year has been so much of a better year than last year. Yea I've ranted and complained about stuff, and yes the world is still shitty due to American foreign policy... however, this year has been better in that I've found my groove, produced good work, and met extremely cool people.   I'm looking forward to summer now. I will, however, have to get research done and a job. But I wonder if it's going to be anything like last summer. For reals, last summer was absolutely insane. Drunken parties, Vegas, concerts, concussions, molotov cocktails, punk rock midgets, The Schayer Impersonator, punching a ceiling, karaoke, vomit, drama, action, comedy... it's amazing no one got hospitalized or arrested.  Let's get ready to rumble!  ***

      [16289]  I rented  School of Rock  and  The Triplets of Belleville  this weekend. I saw School of Rock already and it was really fun, I started The Triplets, but I dozed off due to some insomnia last night. I’m going to finish it later.  I also decided to check out some books for pleasure reading. I checked out  Joy Luck Club  and  Catch 22 . I’m about ¼ the way through Joy Luck Club and so far it’s really got me in a Mother’s Day mood. Not only because it deals with mothers, but because of all the little Chinese-y things in it. There are just so many little things in it that sort of remind me of my own identity. I believe I said something along these lines to Melissa the other day, my “whitewashness” isn’t about ignoring or not knowing about my heritage… it’s about no trying to a stereotyped kind of Asian. I am myself, and I’m not someone who drives a rice rocket or listens to hip-hop or raves.  Something else…. I just want a certain friend to know that all her good qualities are plentiful and outweigh anything negative she, myself, or other people might point out.   4 more days until I’m back in Irvine!   ***

      [16284]   Ok so how has Albert's weekend been thus far?  Thursday night, I went to the Belmar with some art history folks... it was funny when Sanem came by and was like, "Now you even hang out with them!" That was in response to how many art history classes I've taken, despite being a sociology student. I'm sticking by my new academic catchphrase, "I have no discipline! (In every sense of the word)."  Friday, I pretty much just ran errands on campus and hung out with Melissa during the day and then I went to see  Van Helsing  with Nick. After the movie, we went to the Ale House and drank with lots of professor types. I was pretty buzzed and tired by 9, so I stumbled home and went to bed. I think my body has taken a lot of abuse the past week or so... whether it be 2 pits, 2 pies, getting work handed in, returning heavy books, insect bites, alcohol, cleaning, and packing...   I've sort of defending a friend for something, but I think that I should stop doing that. I think he should know better, and it's coming to a point where it's getting annoying to hear what he's says.  I think that today I'm gonna rent a movie or something in the afternoon to pass the time.   ***

      [16277]  So yesterday I rented a car and went up to Buffalo to see the Bouncing Souls show at the Sphere. I’m going to say this now, as nice as the Sphere is as a venue… Buffalo is way too far to go for a show. 3 hrs each way, tolls, and paying for the extra mileage on the rental was too much of a hassle.  Anyway, I got to Buffalo without too many problems… I only almost killed myself skidding on wet pavement getting on an exit ramp. But I got to the venue around 5:30 PM and doors opened at 6…. So I went to go get some gas, so I wouldn’t have to do it when I was already tired after the show. I got back at 6 and parked. I’m gonna say it… the area was weird. It just had this ghost town vibe. It’s kind of like the area around the Glass House, only it was more like an old school town feel with just a few random stragglers. It’s an artsy area with potential that’s unmet. Or maybe it’s just because it was a Wednesday night.  The Sphere is probably the best-designed venue for seeing the stage I’ve ever been to. Everywhere you stand, you have a GOOD view of the stage. However, the acoustics in the place were horrible. It was an unintelligible cacophony for all the sets. Anyway it was a good crowd there was a pit going for all the bands. Let It Burn, the Unseen, Avail and the Bouncing Souls. Randy apparently dropped out of the tour last night due to financial problems. A MARXIST band with financial problems!? What the hell?  I thought Avail was much better than when I saw them open for Propagandhi, but I still think the extra singer is superfluous. I also liked the Souls’ set this time more too. It was a fun crowd with lots of dancing in the pit. However, I liked the NJ crowd better. They were way more energetic.   So I’m all done with everything. I just need to pack and stuff. I almost wish that I booked an earlier flight home.   I thought this  urlLink article  in the LA times was interesting…. Especially given  urlLink Minnow ’s recent posts on her xanga…. anyway this might piss her off to say this, but I think what those cities are doing is wrong. I believe that freedom of speech is something incredibly important, because you never know if putting restrictions on it could turn around and hurt the spread of progressive ideals. It’s the same thing as Neo-Nazi and KKK free speech. I think you should strive to be better than these people, because if they were in power… they would limit your freedoms.  ***

      [16267]  Binghamton's  urlLink weather  is insane. We get extreme heat and humidity, then a storm, and now it's 30 something degrees. It is the Twilight Zone... However, maybe I shouldn't be bitching. So Cal's got a heat wave going on right now. It was hitting 100 and over a few times.  Freedom is mine for the most part. I handed in my 2 papers yesterday and now there's just a few formalities left for me to deal with and then I'm done. It'll be pretty much chilling and packing until I leave next Thursday.  Human rights violations in Iraq and by violations... those prisonners were totally violated (sexually). This is an example of why I have major issues with how people defend the military, not just in this case, but in general. The military as a total institution has no social checks and balances to behavior. Common sense goes out the window, and things like the raping of women in military academies, bases and "accidents" that kill people are not accounted for. I'm not such a hippy in that I do actually believe that as long as there is a interstate system, we need defensive forces. However, I don't like how it is structured as almost a world apart from the rest of society.  Tomorrow is the Bouncing Souls, Randy and Avail!!!  I'm in a pretty good mood right now despite two little somewhat related things. The first is a problem that I knew I'd have to address sooner or later. I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I guess like I've comment on politics... you don't know the implications of decisions when you make them. The second one is sort of the trap I let myself fall back in, that has me feeling apathetic about problem #1. Yea I'm vague... but whatever, I'll be in California in 9 days!!!  ***

      [16265]  The weekend was fun. Pictures of the events of yesterday can be seen on  urlLink Melissa  and  urlLink Becky 's xangas. Yes, I'm willing to sacrifice my dignity for the entertainment of my friends.  Anyway, yea the story behind that is that I had to bribe Becky to tell me a story about her and Melissa talking about me doing the tango. I bribed her with saying that I'd let her throw a burrito in my face. However, when Becky came up to visit Binghamton this weekend, the Taco Bell on campus was not open. Thus she and Melissa decided pot pies, or better yet pot pies with whipped cream on them would be a better subsitute. Oh well... Melissa and Becky said that, that was one of their highlights of the weekend. I guess it's always nice to make friends happy.   Afterwards, I went home and showered, but I didn't back in time to wish Becky a good journey home. However, I ended up hanging around at Melissa's and proofreading her art history paper. Then it was home again to work on my own papers in the extreme humidity.  I've a little ramble that I might do later, but for now a nap sounds good.  ***

      [16257]   I'm feeling a bit sore and tired right now. For the most part, I was lazy all morning yesterday. However, I did get some work done before meeting up with Melissa and Becky at Spring Fling. It was fun for the most part... the only really annoying thing was the long gap between the opening band and Brand New. The concert was fun though. I'm not really a big fan of Brand New, but the lively crowd made it fun. It was somewhat amusing seeing Melissa and Becky's reactions in the chaos of the first few songs. I've noticed something about pits for these type of festival shows... or maybe it's an east coast thing, but the lack of circling. It's more of a chaotic billiard ball break, than the circular movement of pits I'm used to in LA. I look forward to the Bouncing Souls show Wednesday...  After the show, I went home and cleaned up, before heading over to Melanie's place for a little get together. It was nice. It's a shame we Traffic people didn't do more stuff together before. Although the Bud Light was making me sick... it's been a while since I've had cheapo beer like that, and I had 5 cans... ugh...  I got home around 3:30 AM and chatted with Crystal a bit before going to sleep.  It was a fun and tiring day. It's a nice close to the year.   ***

      [16254]   Last night I went to the TASC banquet with Melissa, Becky and Nick. It was alright? I thought the food and performances were better last year. Afterwards, Melissa, Becky and I watched  Clockwork Orange  and played Scrabble. It was cool.  I sort of talked about this before and the topic came up in class Thursday. We read some articles on third wave feminism, and one of them commented the influence of riotgrrl and online zines. Stephanie commented on how that subcultural stuff is simply something that people think is cool, and women don't transition into any sort of real politics from there. I rebutted her comment that, that subculture is something that does lead to the creating of academics and artists with politics. However, she argued that, that means that they're just all bourgeois. I don't really agree with her on that... I'm sure my many of my friends (some of you who read this) would disagree. I mean, come on... there's a big difference between these women than women who listen to misogynistic pop music and let society push 'em around. This goes back to my comments a few days ago in how I can't separate my musical tastes and subcultural roots from my academic work.  A different topic... I think I stumbled back into a trap, that I thought I had got out of. Things that made me angry still really annoy me, but sometimes you get blinded by other things...  ***

      [16828]  I'm back on eastern time more or less. I'm getting up at like 5 AM and going to sleep at 10 PM now. I decided that I didn't wanna keep flip flopping from getting up at 5 AM, and then getting up at like 10 AM, and then back to 5 AM due to irregular work schedules... so I decided to just keep getting up at 5 AM and hitting the gym if I'm not working in the morning.  It's 8 AM and I've already worked out for an hour, showered, made scrambled eggs, made 2 café lattes, checked /wrote email, read the news online, and now I'm blogging. I like being productive! I'll probably get to work early again to find parking and do some reading.   urlLink Laine ... I still don't get what's so funny about carrying milk to the car!  I'm only 1/3 through this  urlLink Krishna Sen  book on Indonesia cinema. So far it has some stuff on Chinese ownership of movie production and distribution, and a small section on how Indian and American films were competing in Indonesia for market share in the 1950s. This is really interesting for me, given what I'm hoping to do for future research. The book, however, seems to be mostly about nationalism and building (kind of whatever for me).  ***

      [16823]  Normally I get to the gym around 5:45 - 6 AM. Today I got up late and discovered that 6:45 AM is too late to get to the gym. By that time all the treadmills are taken up, and I like to start my workouts with at least a mile run. That gets my heart rate up, and my body warmed up sufficiently before my lifting. The bikes just don't do it for me. Stair steppers are good for warming, but given my crooked knees the restricted movement doesn't feel so good. Also I don't want to wear out my legs when I have to stand for 6 hrs at work later.   For the record, I'm not much of a lifter. I'm not about maxing, or body building. I just sort of keep in mind general things like form, rest and eating protein before and after the work out. I lift more for general muscle endurance, so that I can carry gallons of milk to the car or push people out of my way in the pit.   It's a month and a half into summer, and still 2 months away from the start of a new semester. Binghamton feels really far away right now. I'm trying to read before my shifts at work, to keep myself academic.   ***

      [16817]  There's sort of this vicious cycle I get in. For the past few years, I've been sort of letting something creep into my mind that confuses me on some stuff. It's sort of a confusion between desires, knowing what's best, and fear. This confusion seems to set in from time to time, until something distracts me.  Yea that was a vague ramble.  I was extremely sore at work today, and it was long and brutal . $15 in tips and a pizza bagel is not good compensation for the grueling day. The weather also wasn't bright and sunny... so me brining a change of clothes was a waste.  I get to work 12 PM to 6 PM everyday until Wednesday.... hopefully I have Thursday off for Warped.  ***

       Something more on welfare...&nbsp;  Dork_for_sale  &nbsp;mentioned something about training people for jobs in an earlier comment. I thought I'd expand on my ideas some more.   Many people (such as the economist I mentioned) argue that there was an economic boom&nbsp;lead by Reagan&nbsp;that created many new jobs, despite the outsourcing. If you look at the numbers, they are right. However, a problem is the difference between the types of jobs outsourced and created. Many industrial jobs with strong ties to unions were outsourced for cheaper labor in other countries. The new jobs created were in a completely different field, as the United States more or less transitioned from an industrial economy to  postindustrial  / information economy. The jobs created required different skills, workers, and facilities than what the old industrial towns and workers had to offer. This resulted in these places to begin falling apart, and the workers were now unemployed.   I get pissed off when people say that these unemployed people should just get job. What about the job market? What jobs are there exactly for these people to get bessides McDonalds? How will these people  get paid ?     Dork_for_sale  &nbsp;suggested, the government should fill in the gap and help these people get trained for better jobs. I completely agree with that. However, I feel&nbsp;that education in general is the key. Maybe it's my bias as an educator, but I think that fixing crappy schools is the first step to solve these problems in the long term...

      [16793] And when the sky darkens and the prospect is war  Who's given a gun and then pushed to the fore  And expected to die for the land of our birth  Though we've never owned one lousy handful of earth?  -Dropkick Murphys' "Worker's Song"  That's the lyric that popped into my head at the end of  urlLink Farenheit 9/11 .  That movie made me feel a combination of angry and sad over a lot of things in our society.  I just don't get how people can accept how things are being run. I recently read a comment on a website about how Reagan's cutting of welfare was good because it forces people to get jobs. Then this person (who has a masters in economics), said that despite the free trade policy that outsourced jobs... there was a great deal of insourcing as well. I simply don't get how these people can say tout the benefits of these economic policies, when cities are crumbling. Michael Moore discusses this in Roger and Me, and sort of makes a parallel in how this results in more poor people enlisting in Farenheit 9/11.  **

      [16779]  Ok in thinking about yesterday... waking up at 6 AM and working out, and having a closing shift equals a very tired Albert by 1 AM.  Brandon is right, that Del Taco on Irvine Blvd. likes to screw up orders late at night.  I'm opting against the show night, because it's $20 at the door. A wee bit pricey for my tastes. Perhaps I shall hang out with other friends instead tonight. Sorry Crystal.  I need to go to the UCI library today.  **

      [16763]  Just had lunch with Minh-An at the Elephant Bar. I haven't eaten there in ages, and it's pretty good. I should eat there again before going back out east (as well as hang out with Minh-An again).   So I got gym membership at 24 hr Fitness, and went to the gym this moring at 5:30 AM. It was a weird crowd that early. Lots of older buff people (men and women in their 40s or older) wearing tight clothes.   This is the society we live in: Walmart is  sexist &nbsp;and  murderers  don't get convicted. Sad huh? ***

      Yesterday was fun. I went to the City of Irvine's Global Village festival, had some free food, and watched Steff do a hula performance. After that I went to Steff's birthday celebration at the Spectrum. It was very enjoyable, despite everything at the Spectrum being overpriced.   The following is mostly in response to Crystal's dropkicks on an earlier post.   The issue of people who dress punk, makes me think of the end of the movie SLC Punk and some of the questions raised. At what point is clinging on to a certain aspect of a genre, scene, etc. unrealistic? How much does a changing society as well as a growing person deal with this?  Call me an old man at 24, but it's seems to me a lot more teenagers sport the "look" than us older folks. While I have nothing against people's freedom of expression, I guess what I'm trying to question the juvenile tribalism of this (by juvenile I simply mean youth). I don't really think that mohawks, leather jackets, etc. are real markers of the lifestyle, as that stuff is all fluff and spectacle. They say less about punk, than the individual and what they think is or isn't punk. One only has to think about how people talk about authenticity.  It should be noted that back then, not every one dressed that way (especially in the diverse LA scene). Also most of the bands themselves do not dress that way anymore. So what does that mean? What does it mean when a couple in their 30s tries to show their 10 year old how to mosh in a museum? Is this reverance and preservation of cultural simulacra?  Crystal suggested that you can't help it if corporations encroach on the lifestyle, and things change, but can stay true. However, if you accept that, does that mean you accept that Sum 41 and A New Found Glory are in some way just as valid of punk as Black Flag and the Damned?  I don't have the answers, but I think that a problem is that a lot of younger people who listen to punk "buy" into the music without thinking about what they are doing. That's my whole point of raising these questions. I would, of course, never say that the people whom I've shared time in the pit with are all poseurs. It's just that I worry about these kids, who end up growing out of punk rock, because they never really understood what they were doing to begin with.  ***

      [16738]   I really don't know what to think about kids who try to dress punk. I saw a lot of kids doing that last night. I think the irony is there were a lot of men and women there in their 30s and 40s that are the original punks weren't dressed like the kids. I say kids, because for the most part it's teenagers that do the mohawk, jackets, etc.    I'm all for freedom of expression, but I think there's a side to trying to look a certain way (that no longer exists) that is ironic. The "look" of the originals were all DIY, you couldn't go to Hot Topic and buy that look. If you're trying to look a certain way, it says something about who you actually are and what the scene has become.   Ok so I didn't really say much about the art at  LACMA  yet.   I mentioned in the previous post about how there is something weird about punk being at the  Autry . I think museums in general are weird, in that that there is a decontextualization of what is actually in the museum from where the art / music came from. It's sort of like the difference between seeing an animal on safari or in a  zoo .   Despite understanding the importance of preservation, I sort of don't like how galleries are decontextualizing of the artwork. Artwork from all over are collected and put in artificial environments with minimal explanation of where they came from. Yes the stuff at LACMA were made to look nice and have some cohesivity. However, I thought the  Beyond&nbsp;Geometry  exhibit didn't really push how the art was really about the epistemological shift from modernism to postmodernism. Instead it was just eye candy, without meaning. This exhibit had far fewer plaques describing the exhibit than the other one on race in Mexico.  The  Inventing Race  exhibit was good. However, I find the periodization of the exhibit weird. They chose a period of time when Englightenment ideals of the rights of man and how that applied racially were a big deal and cut it off at 1790, a year in which those Englightenment ideals were fought for not just for white folk in France, but slaves in Haiti. I think the art work raises a lot of interesting questions about race (and class) in a historical context, that the curators didn't push enough.

      My god traffic was crappy from Irvine all the way up to downtown LA.  T.S.O.L. w/ the Dickies, D.I., Channel 3 and Pour Habit at the Autry Museum was awesome. At first it was really weird in that they set up a stage in the plaza before entering the museum. The stage was next to a statue of Gene Autry, pictures of indians and rather close to the Mary Pickford Educational Center. I’m not going to get into sociological discussions of social definitions of space, but to put it simply it was really weird.   I missed the two openers and was inline for beer, when I heard "O.C. Life" being played. I ditched the beer line (which was moving very slow) for D.I.’s set (they also closed with the Agnew / Adolescents song "Amoeba"). I guess that makes up for not seeing the Adolescents last weekend. Anyway I just decided to enjoy the show sober for the rest of the night the beer line was just too slow. The crowd wasn’t really into D.I., but they really got into the Dickies. Those guys were hilarious. T.S.O.L. was insane and so was the crowd. There was minimal security so there was a lot of stage diving. A guy also broke his leg in the pit, whom I helped carry out. Anyway… it was particularly insane when they closed with "Code Blue." 25-30 of us stormed the stage and started a mosh pit ON THE STAGE. So I was in a mosh pit on a stage with TSOL in a museum. That was just surreal.  This is mainly for hardcore Bad Religion fans, but in between bands, they would show videos of live performances of old school bands. Stuff like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, and Subhumans. Anyway, they actually showed Bad Religion doing "New Leaf" with Greg Graffin, Greg Hetson, and I think it’s Finestone on drums and Tim Gallego on bass.  Oh and you know the song Offspring song Bad Habit? Let just say Albert’s complaints about someone driving their care at 50 mph in the fast lane cease, when he sees their piece.  ***

       I pretty much like all of Southern California... from the&nbsp;619 to the 818. I was just down in San Diego this weekend, and I went up to LA for the  LA County Museum of Art 's All Niter last night. It was cool I went up there with Naomi N. and Naomi R. for free art,  peanut butter , and for all the interesting LA people walking around this huge event. Tonight I'll be headed up to the  Autry Museum  for the  Wild in the Streets  exhibit and show. Channel 3, D.I., the Dickies and  TSOL  are playing, and there'll be other punk rock stuff going on too.   Speaking of punk... I was watching a show on VH1 for the 100 greatest hard rock bands and I find some questionable choices for the punk bands on there. Outside of the obvious big 3 (Ramones, Sex Pistols, and Clash), I think Fugazi is a good choice, but I don't know about the Misfits, and Rollins Band. There's also Iggy Pop and Bad Brains, which I think are alright.   Fugazi is sort of a the missing link between punk, alternative, indie, and emo. So I think that's a good rationale, but with the Misfits and Rollins I'm less sure about. For sure, without the Misfits there'd be no AFI and psychobilly would be very different if existent at all. However, I don't know about their overall impact on all of hard rock outside of a strain of punk. I really don't get having the Rollins Band, and not Black Flag. The other bands are reasonable too. However, I think bands like the Damned, and X are deserving of spots. Or even Bad Religion. I mean come on Hole and Ratt shouldn't really be on there. ***

We also watched a bit on the guy who invented the invincible bear suit.  I, then had to wake up for work at 5:15 AM for work. It wasn't so bad since I just loaded up on coffee.

      Last night I had a dream that Brandon and I saw Bad Religion at a house party of sorts. It was weird. I kept heckling the band too. Oh yea and in the OC Register's report of the Weenie Roast they totally goofed on Jay Bentley's name... they called him Ian Bentley.  I saw Super Size Me with Naomi N today. It made me angry at Binghamton Univ. for dealing with Sodexho and Coke (and probably a sweatshop using company for clothes).  People make arguments for capitalism, but what does it mean that students on campus have few choices when it comes to food. Expand that to the urban landscape in which healthier mom and pop shop restaurants get wiped out by McDonalds, Taco Bell, KFC, etc. It's scary that how ubiquitous the golden arches are as I think I've gone pass the McDonalds in LA and NY that they featured in the film.  It's ironic when one thinks that it's up to the eater to make good choices and not the fault of these fast food chains, when it's hard to pick up healthy items on the go. It's even more messed up when the so-called healthier items at fast food places aren't as healthy as people think. Salads at McDonald's can have as much fat as Big Macs.  Work again at 6:30 AM... arg  **

        People on low carb diets are a slight annoyance, but people who are buy low carb fast food are&nbsp;especially dumb.     I saw a poster at  Carl's Jr . for the low carb breakfast bowl that had scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and cheese in it. That sucker has to have some absurd amount of saturated fat, which is worse for you than carbohyrdrates. Other fast food places have other stupid low carb things too.     I think that low carb is lame, because first of all you need realistic diets. You need to get into a dietary habit that you realistically can stick to. That means balanced  reasonably  portion meals are best. Secondly, you need carbohydrates... especially if you are working out. It's energy.  ***

It's not cool to go down to San Diego, do a decent amount of drinking, get up at 7 AM for a graduation, and then be in Laguna Beach by noon for work.  The Adolescents show didn't work out because the bar had a no ins-and-outs policy and the band wasn't going to hit the stage until 1 AM. So I went to meet up with Steff and Julia in La Jolla and then we met up with Andy, Abby and and others down there in a pub.  Work was brutal due to my lack of rest. I pretty much fell asleep by 8:30 PM.  Well that trip from Berkeley and then going to work was worse.  ***

      [16664]  I've been downloading a lot of new music lately... and speaking of music... I really like this  urlLink Complete Control  show on 103.1 FM. It has a crappy timeslot though... 9 PM - 10 PM on Thursday nights. I only caught the begining of it, because I went to the UCI Pub last night for some drinking with Derek and Alex. They were playing a lot of X and Social D there last night.  Something that really trips me out is whenever I drive down Bryan Ave. It's  urlLink suburban sprawl . I remember Bryan Ave, when it was all orange groves. Now it is all homes, and all the trees are now gone. Endless expansion, more homes, more retail, and more pollution social and environmental. Suburban sptawl... it's endless construction... yet instead of more space, there's less of a sense of place. Traffic intensifies and it takes longer to get from point A to point B and you're trapped in the limbo that is your car. Yet we buy into this...  People keep saying that want to visit me at work... nice of them.  ***

      [16651]  Now listening to some  urlLink 1208 . They're a really cool band that I've been getting into lately.  I don't know how many of you outside of Orange County are following this  urlLink rape trial . Basically 3 teenagers filmed themselves having sex with a possibly unconscious girl. One of the teenagers is the son of the assistant Orange County sheriff. When I read about what the defense is saying, it comes across as really sexist. They are essentially saying don't listen to the slut. I know attacking the credibilty of the accuser is a part of trials, but are statements about her wanting to be a porn star, being promiscuous, etc. really relavent? The real issue is if it was consensual.  Speaking of other OC stuff... some officials want to  urlLink rename  John Wayne airport to The O.C. Airport after the TV show. That's so lame. Alex: what would they do with the Wayne statue? maybe they'll put a Mischa barton statue next to him? Hmm... looks like they're making me work some morning shifts next week. That means getting up at 5 AM!   Adolescents Saturday! Gotta make b-day plans too. Already got an e-greeting from Linda.  ***

      [16634]  Oooh... the  urlLink "Los Angeles is Burning"  video is out. I'm digging it. It's kind of like Incubus' Megalomania or the  urlLink Hives ' Main Offender videos though... only fire-y.  I was playing this  urlLink Bush Game  today... er yesterday. Very amusing game from the makers of Emogame.  I've been listening to  urlLink the Adolescents  a lot lately. I'm all about the OC pride right now. Working at Diedrichs (an OC coffee chain), listening to the Adolescents, and I'm at the moment wearing an old Irvine wrestling shirt. I even just burned myself a So Cal mix CD heavy on Orange County bands such as  urlLink Guttermouth ,  urlLink Social D ,  urlLink Offspring ,  urlLink Ignite , etc.   Insomnia sucks...  ***

      [16626]  I recently watched  Along Came Polly  and  50 First Dates . I'm not really on a romantic comedy thing, it's just that those were some divx movies that my brother had downloaded. 50 First Dates was pretty funny though... Along Came Polly not so much.   Strange how the leaving for work part feels like such a chore, but once I'm there it's cool. I just sort of feel tired when I get home from standing for 6 hrs and pouring / brewing coffee. My fingers smell like coffee still...  Lots of old school punk bands are playing this month  X ,  TSOL ,  DI ,  The Adolescents ,  The Dickies ,  Bad Religion , etc. I really hope I can catch these shows.  A link that's been making rounds on the internet is this thing on bringing back the  urlLink draft . I think it's a fucking scary thing that will affect millions of young men and women in this country if our governments foreign policy doesn't change. Regardless of who wins or loses the election in November, we're stuck dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan. I remember when I first read reports last year about how the American military is spread pretty thin because we have military bases all over the world, and on battleships, and in submarines. It's not surprising that there are people trying to bring it back.  I've been saying for a long time that Iraq isn't just about oil. It's about American foreign policy and military strategy. Having military bases over there with a ready supply of oil is undoubtedly a very useful thing in case anything goes awry in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe.  Alot of things bother me about the government right now.  ***

      I had a weird dream about being stuck in the 19th century with Steff and trying to keep her from meeting men there, because of it possibly screwing up the time line. Other guest stars were Melissa, Janet and Julia. Then there was a hallway in a castle with a bunch of doors that was like out of a Scooby Doo episode, and a Planet of the Apes musical number in which the apes played music as I sang Van Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl."  I've been having weird dreams lately.  ***

      [16617]  It's sad that a guy that secretly sold arms to Iran, tried to overthrow a democratically-elected government, cut welfare programs for single mothers, sent int the national guard to beat up college students, was anti-gay and anti-rock and roll will forever be loved because he happened to be president during the Soviet collapse.  ***

      Anarchism is against state-centered political organization, and state-centered political organization (order) of capitalism. Anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti were part of early century radical movements that consisted of left-wing groups such as anarchists and socialists. Both groups were involved with labor strikes, protested against World War I and espoused revolutionary politics. So they did have some sort of unifying politics. This was a period of time when robber baron capitalists made massive amounts of money off the backs of the people. This was the time of The Great Gatsby as well as The Jungle. Anyway, the revolutionary politics are what brings about the connotation of disorder. They wanted drastic change for the current order. Thus right wing politics since French Revolution such as Edmund Burke have criticized these people for challenging order (disorder). On the other side, other Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Paine, who was a revolutionary, believed that people were inherently good. This is sort of the long historical tradition of this debate.  Is anarchy or the less loaded term “revolutionary politics” about disorder? I think my problem is that we can’t challenge the current “order” revolution without a lot of people being killed in revolutions, and people starving. How much food, cloth, and other necessities come from thousands of miles away? With a world population of 6 billion, we certainly can’t exactly go back to hunting and farming for our food since pavement covers so much of the American landscape now. Today anarchists protest the World Trade Organization and the war in Iraq, because they are outcomes of evil capitalism (just like 80 years ago). I think that’s a good thing, because there are places in the United States and around the world in which people are exploited for their labor, or are left with no economy. However, without a systematized order we’re in deep shit. It’s too late the world has been burned by capitalism. We’ve got to heal and learn from the situation, not go back to self-sustaining cooperatives.   I just think that revolutionary politics do more harm than good. I especially don’t believe that people are inherently good. Every successful well-intentioned revolution from the American, French, Haitian, Russian, etc. resulted in nation-states that favored the elite and not the masses they were supposed to be helping. Anarchists are different of course from these revolutions in that they aren’t about seizing state-authority, but like I said with how the world is today you need some sort of “organization” to make sure roads delivering goods aren’t falling apart.   ***

      [15606]  Man I went to sleep last night right after dinner and here I am now.   So here’s some catch up… Thursday night I went down to San Diego with  urlLink Nai  to catch the  urlLink Keane ,  urlLink Matt Pond PA , and  urlLink Aveo  show at the  urlLink Casbah . It was a fun little trip. We got some  urlLink In N Out  prior to leaving Irvine and watched planes land outside of the venue before the very late doors opening (8:45 ish). The show was good, despite the first few songs Aveo played making me think the openers were going to suck. But when they changed guitars and the girl got off stage, so they could play their older songs, it got a lot better. Matt Pond PA was really good (despite the lame name). They had a cello that really accentuated their indie-sound. I think bands like  urlLink Yellowcard  should learn from them, because sometimes their electric violin gets drowned out or isn’t fully used in some of their songs. The cello was there in the music throughout Matt Pond PA’s set. I think they’re the first indie band in a while to really impress me. Keane was good too. I honestly don’t think I would have liked them if they weren’t in a small venue like the Casbah. I think the comparison to Coldplay is kind of unfair, but I can see it. Anyway I just really don’t think that style of music translates well to large venues. I don’t get why people spend $50 to see bands like Coldplay in stadiums, and people are saying Keane will move up to that in “6 months.” I don’t even think that Weezer, as much I enjoy them, translate well to large venues. Live music has to be experienced up close so you can see and feel the energy from the band. That’s not something you can do in Section 3, Seat G27.   Here are some things that have been on my mind lately.   I read an interview lately with  urlLink Randy  in which they said something about them not liking capitalism and preferring anarchy. I don’t know what the band means by anarchy, because it is a term that connotes disorder. Indeed disorder is an order that is alternative to the capitalist world order; however, realistically if we look at stuff like food production… the world is pretty fucked if all “order” and capitalist organization breaks down - there will be starvation. I think a redistribution of political and economic power is better... not necessarily in communistic or socialistic ways, but in ways that allow for growth without screwing others over.  ***

      [16580]  Work is good so far.  They shut down the 133 due to an accident on the Laguna Canyon part of it, so I got to take PCH home around sunset. It was nice, despite the addition of 20 minutes to my drive home.   I like the gold and ochre colors of the chaparral more than the dark greens and browns of the east coast wilderness.  However, the vibrant greens of Scotland win over everything I've seen.  Lots of shows next next weekend, hopefully I can actually go to them.  Mmmm... beer...  Here's a little dialogie on beer: Me: beer feels clausterphobic in the box and wants the warmth of a human's love... like a puppy. Diana: how does it feel in the human's mouth. Crystal: you dont consume puppies, hopefully. ***

      Is it weird when you remove people from your "cool people" mental list, and know that you're off their list too? I get the feeling that I'm being misunderstood, and I think that my friend has done stupid stuff. I don't think we hate one another, but things are different now.  I hate doing and thinking stuff like that, because I have a sort of thing with loyalty. I don't like to give up on people. When I say that I want to be there for someone, I mean when I say it... and despite later reluctance, I still mostly mean it (even now).   It's weird though, it's always the people that I sort of let in the most that I lose touch with. My  urlLink Trillian  program logs most of my chats online, and like of the 25 people that I talk to the most... 2 are people that I no longer talk to at all (one of which is a mutual hatred), 4 are people that I rarely talk to now (for various reasons), and there's one person that I wish wouldn't talk to me. Let's just say the ranks of various people that I don't talk to anymore even when adjust for multiple screen names is... interesting.  *

      [16553]  Damn it Anti-Flag tickets are sold out...  Ok, I was all over the LA area this weekend and I sort of want to comment on perceptions of class and space in southern California. One of So Cal's biggest industries is real estate... there's construction, sales, landscapping, etc. However, in the building of places both physical, social and imagined it's clear that the differentiation falls along socio-economic paramters.  Something really popular, and has been accentuated more by  The O.C.  and other local media is the defining areas by  urlLink area codes ... the 909 (Chino, San Bernadino, etc.), is made fun of as the redneck / trashy part of So Cal. The use of area codes is, of course, in part arbitrarily created by phone companies; however, the values associated with area codes has profound impacts on future area code creation. The creation of 626 is the best example, because it is sandwiched between the so-called "ghetto" 323 and "white trashy" 909. It was created to make "nice" places like Pasadena not a part of the 323 and 909.  To say that there are no poor people in the 323 and trailers in the 909 would not be true, but something about the morphology of So Cal is that it is extremely fragmented so that perceptions of various places being good or bad simply are not absolute realities. Someone once joked to me that in LA you're often times just one or two freeway exits away from ghetto places. The 310 and 562 are good examples in that as you go up the I-405 and along CA-91, you pass through cities both "good" and "bad."   My point of this is that I don't like these stereotypes of place and the people in the places. Because this adds into the idea of a culture of the poor... people perceive people in  those  areas as different (an other). Maybe its just me, but I've never felt unsafe anywhere in So Cal... even in places that are supposed to be bad. I used to date a girl from East LA and I'd drive home to Irvine at 2 AM. People would tell me that I was nuts, but whatever.   Indeed in some places there is more crime than others, but the creation of a "Fortress L.A" as  urlLink Mike Davis  calls it is ultimately problematic. Just as parts of bourgeois upper class LA are designed to restrict foot traffic, and have limited public transit as a way of keeping out the poor... these places often need to employ lower class servants to work in restaurant kitchens, and garden. This is a self-contradicting situation and I think it is further hypocrisy when rich people pull the culture of poverty crap, when they are too lazy to mow their own lawns, and cook their own food. Then these rich folk let the cops to hassle the people coming in to do this work.  ***

      [17242]  Now playing:  Tsunami Bomb  - Say What You Mean  If I was running for president, this is what I'd be saying in my speeches.  Gay Marriage: With all the neoclassical architecture in Washington DC, you'd think that man-on-man love would be something politicians would want. Also looking at the statisics on divorce, domestic abuse, etc. straight people have fucked up marriage enough. So maybe no one should want marriage? Emotional attachment sucks ass anyway.  Now playing:  The Sahara Hotnights  - Quite A Feeling  Stem Cell Research: So rectal / colon cancer is expected to cause about 56,730 deaths (28,320 men and 28,410 women) during 2004. I don't know about you, but the thought of someone removing chunks out of my colon, rectum, etc. isn't appealing. If stem cell research can fix my ass, then I'm all for it.  Now playing:  The Sounds  - Living in America  I basically slept all day yesterday. I had to recover from the lack of sleep the night before.  ***

      [17234]  Now playing:  Iggy Pop  - Little Know It All  So last night I met up with Diana, Nikki, and Nikki's friend Fluvia. We pretty much drove around looking for something to do in LA, but alas there was no parking to be found for the longest time. However, then all of a sudden we found parking literally infront of the BJs in Westwood. Shocking!   It was cool. I now add Diana and Nikki to the assortment of boardies that I've met so far. Suzy, Ashok, Toni-Lynne, Diana T., Cissa, and Mike. A total of 8! All of course are cool people.  Now playing:   urlLink Bad Religion   - Live Again (The Fall of Man)  I only got 3 hrs of sleep last night as I didn't get home and into bed until about 2 AM, and I had to be at 5 ish for work at 7 AM.   So some people asked why people don't like that co-worker I mentioned in an earlier post. Well this morning, I was running a few minutes behind schedule and I saw a parking spot infront of the coffee shop. However, I couldn't park in it, because the girl parked all funky and I couldn't get into the spot. I had to go park a bit further away from the store.  Now playing:  NOFX  - Franco Un-American  I'm not so petty that I'd not like her because of a parking incident. Lots of people have talked about how her work rate isn't very good, hogs certain jobs and how she orders people around. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, because people make mistakes and she might have a hard time adjusting to working there.  However, she really is somewhat bossy. She asks people to do stuff, but isn't always ready to help other people out. Another co-worker higher up in the ranks told me, that if she  tells  you to do anything, you don't have to do it. It doesn't help that she asks for lots of days off, and doesn't seem to make an effort of trying to get to know people.   Now playing:   urlLink Pulley   - Insects Destroy  I'm hungry. I haven't had lunch yet. I don't know if I want to sleep first or eat first.  **

I'm feeling really tired right now, despite that nap I took earlier.  So there's this girl at work that nobody likes. At first I felt kind of bad that all the other girls rip on her behind her back. I've worked a few hours here and there with her before, and didn't really have any problems. However, now I sort of see why no one likes her. I fuck up here and there, but at least I try to be a part of a team.   Now playing:   urlLink Weezer   - Say It Ain't So  Speaking of people not liking people. Sometimes I wonder if I push things too much. It's something about my sick sense of humor in which I like to see how people react to things.   Now playing:   urlLink Alkaline Trio   - Crawl  I spent most of my afternoon (following my nap) uploading stuff to my new  urlLink phone . If Nikki doesn't call about doing anything tonight by 8:30, I'm hitting the gym.  10 days until Vegas, 20 days until no more work, 29 days until year 3  **

      [17217]  Now playing:  The Offspring  - Spare Me The Details  I just got a new cell phone, and a new phone number to go with it. Call my old number for the new number, or check your email (to see if you're one of the special ones to get the email).  Today was a productive day. In addition to the new cellphone thing, I cleaned my room, and did some drawing.  Now playing:  Anti-Flag  - Turncoat  I want to rant on television sensationalism. I was watching NBC 4 News and they had a really stupid story about a Japanese study on how women who eat eggs daily have a higher risk of dying than women who eat eggs a couple times a week (or less). That was such a shitty job of reporting. They didn't talk about what women were dying of, or the demographics of the study. How old were these women who were dying? And of cancer? heart attacks? The stupid story just basically said that women who eat a lot of eggs have a higher risk of dying.   The real story behind the report is that over a 14 year and 9,300 person study in Japan, researchers found a difference in cholesterol levels (3%). However, were inconclusive about the link between eggs themselves and the deaths, because the deaths in the sample were not necessarily heart attacks or strokes. There was only the 22% increased likelihood that the women would who ate an egg a day would die of any cause compared with those who ate only a couple eggs per week.   Now playing:  NOFX  - Flossing a Dead Horse  The correlation between the deaths and eggs is really weak. The sad thing is that the world is full of stupid people, and they'll just think that eggs will kill you.  TV news is just absurd... the most absurd of them all is FOX News. Bill O'Reilly is the ultimate sensationalist. The guy's ranted to a 9/11 victim's family member, and ranted on Carson Daly having a tattoo (that's supposed to be in honor of his father). The guy's invited government officials from other countries onto his show, and not let them speak. He claims that there's no spin to his show too, and people are dumb enough to believe him.  Now playing:  Pennywise  - Society  In other TV news, I'm extremely addicted to watching Alton Brown's Good Eats.  Ok I've got work at 7 AM tomorrow. Nice huh?  ***

      [17194]  Now playing:  The Darkness  - I Believe In A Thing Called Love  I find it interesting that I've had browsers set to the various language encodings visit my webpage: English (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Austrailia), Korean, Dutch, German, Polish, Farsi, Greek. Who are you people and why aren't you leaving comments?  Now playing:  Stiff Little Fingers  - Wasted Life  I'm a person that takes pleasure in making fun of people. Katrina at work and her animal obsession and cheery disposition is such an easy target. Then again so are the other 'nice' people that wander into the shop.  Speaking of that, I want to tell another story about some of the quirky people I come across at work.  So there's this old dude that's around in the mornings. He's a former alcoholic marine, who claims to be the driver in 4 hit and runs before finding Christ. He's an interesting dude that's got some 'interesting' things to say. He talks about how he could have easily got the shot off from the Dallas book depository that people claim Oswald shot (or didn't shoot) Kennedy from.  So one day, another old dude shows up as I'm sitting at one of the benches with the guy, and he greets the other guy with "How's your faith today?" That's a quirky greeting, even from a relatively open minded hellbound atheist like me.  Now playing:  Flogging Molly  - Drunken Lullabies  So anyway... they go one for a bit about their daily 'faith' level and then go into a discussion of someone who recently got married. This then transitions into a discussion of tits, ass, and legs.   I find it strange that people who are so paranoid about their faith, who have to reaffirm nonstop, can outright speak of the opposite sex in such objectifying ways. Not that weird shit doesn't come out of mouth (like my discussion of labia colors last weekend at a bbq)... but I don't live my life in fear of abiding by values that are contradictory to things that I do.   Now playing:  The Strokes  - Someday  Today was an ok day of work. It's kind of sad that our beloved manager is leaving us. I feel sort of bad for the people that are staying at the store following summer's end. It's a major upheavel of the staffing there. It's always a bummer when you stop seeing and talking to people you've come to know. I only have a few more weeks of work left.  ***

I had a dream that I was back in high school and two guys Joey T. and Jonathan F. came after me with knives. I was able to disarm them and beat some sense into them. I don't like dreams like this because I end up not getting much rest.  Now playing:  Alkaline Trio  - Continental  Anyway, it should be noted that I'll be getting a new cell and phone number soon. So check your emails for my new number.  I was talking to Steff last night about the sad state of world affairs, and I noted that 6.9 million adults were incarcerated or on probation or parole last year in the USA... 1.2 billion people in the world are living on less than $1 day. Sad huh? It gets even more messed up when you look at who these people who are getting locked up or starving are. They are essentially non-white people.

I went from an 800 rating this morning before work, to 730 after work. I need to be caffeinated up when I play. Actually I need to be caffeinated up for pretty much everything... everything that doesn't require me to be liquored up that is.  Before work I dropped by Radio Shack to pick up a fuse for my FM transmitter, because I keep fucking up the settings and blowing the fuse. I ran into Ryan there, and after some chatting it was discovered that his girlfriend works at the Crossroads Diedrichs. I mentioned this to Anna, and she says she might know her. It's a small world here in The 'Vine.   Now playing:  The Bouncing Souls  - Kids and Heroes  Yes The 'Vine is so small that it turns out that Abby lives a mere few minutes walking distance from Brandon.   More fighting in Iraq, violence in Sudan, and even kids getting killed on the streets of America. What a world it is we live in! Is this the best of all possible worlds? With all the progress we as species have made in art, science, and technology, we still let a large chunk of the population. Over a billion people on this planet are living on less than $1 a day. How many of these people are children who won't live into their teenage years due to starvation? How many of these children will be drafted into the military like in Uganda, or be trained to be suicide bombers like in the Middle East?  Now playing:  The Offspring  - Jennifer Lost the War  I'm tired and thirsty right now. I think I'll have some water and then sleep.  ***

We were always low on ingredients at the bar, because there was never a break in the patronage for us to run to the back and stock up.  Now playing:  The Dropkick Murphys  - The Gauntlent  So last night I went to a BBQ at Ki's with Steff and Abby. Got to hang out with other familiar folks and cool new people there too. Sucking down 8 beers in an hour and a half is um... lovely...   Now playing:  Hot Hot Heat  - Oh, Goddamnit  I've got my Chessmaster 9000 rating up to 780. I'm beating 900 level computer players now. I'm gradually improving my rating.  Ok so to continue on my rant on fat and stupid people. I want to rip on Carl's Jr some more. I've commented on the stupidity of their low carb breakfast bowl, but their low carb chicken sandwich commercials are just absurd. They are basically advertising that their chicken sandwiches (which have bacon on them), can help women lose fat by cutting down the carbs. If people actually believe that eating something with bacon and cheese will help them lose weight, they almost deserve the heart attacks.   It should be noted that people actually do come into the coffee shop and ask about low carb beverages and food.  Now playing:  The Clash  - Should I Stay Or Should I Go?

      [17121]  Work was a good day in tips yesterday. It was generally pretty chill working with Lynette and Katie. Later in the night I hung out at Katie and Eric's. Had a beer, inhaled some nitrous oxide, and played Halo. It was a fun night...  I'm going to comment on something that might not be very politically correct. Seeing as how I work in a place that serves some extremely fatty drinks. I find it absolutely retarded when people want a sweet drink, that is healthy. Or when I see unheathily overweight people order our drinks with heavy cream, chocolate, and flavor syrups. It's the same thing when friends of mine complain about their weight and always order dessert.   To be honest I see more women fall into this stupidity. I don't get women in this society that eat high fat foods, and then have personal self expectations of looking like a celebrity. Yes, society is screwed up for creating absurd ideals of appearance, but you can not play this game to begin with! However, many women who fall into the trap of buying into this are weak for not having a more positive self image. Then they are dumb for deciding to have that ice cream for dessert. And finally, they flake out on working out. So if you chose to play the game, you have ways of coming out on top. You just don't take those options. Or you chose unrealistic plans such as the Atkins or South Beach Diet...  Stupid people annoy me..  ***

      [17114]  I had a dream last night that we busted Ashton Kutcher for trespassing at work. There was also a weird part where I visited  urlLink Esther  at Target (where she lived).  It's sad that I'm dreaming of work... last night was a closing shift, but was a good night in tips.  Apparently  urlLink Stephanie 's car radiator problems is an epidemic, as it spread to my brother and I's car. We're down to 2 cars for 4 people, and some of us have to work!!! Looks like I have to wait until my mom gets home to get to work...  My Chessmaster blitz rating is now 580... kind of crappy...  ***

      [17092]  Yesterday was mostly productive. I ran and swam in the morning. Ok not so much swam, but jumped into the pool to cool off. Then went to UCI to have lunch with Steff.  I like how Steff and her sister keep giving me future permission to slap her... yesterday at lunch, she said if, when she gets married, she becomes one of those annoying couples that say "we" all the time... I can slap her. Cissa also once said that if Steff ever falls asleep at a show again, I have permission to slap her.  Eeew... these scrambled eggs I just made came out weird... ok enough of this..  Anyway, I didn't have any caffeine yesterday at all. So after lunch, when I went to the library to go through some old NY Times stuff on movies, I crashed. That's what happens when you're used to 4 shots of espresso, 2 cups of coffee, and other stuff in a day... despite that, I did find some interesting stuff.  I'm closing at work today. Happy happy joy joy... or maybe not.  I feel like I could really use a dose of excitement or misery. Things are too normal in my life right now.   ***

      [17043]  Ok people are visiting this blog... I see your IP addresses. Y'all should leave comments!  I've come to the conclusion that waking up at 5 AM in the morning and working out results in more energy than if I wake up at 9 AM and work out after work. I also get more shit done. I actually always wake up around 6 AM, but the thoughts of drifting back into dreamland (and not facing reality) is so enticing.  In my last post I mentioned a customer at the coffee shop. I think I'll mention a few more stories as interesting people are plentiful at the coffee shop. Tourists, local artists, bums, shady characters, and beach folk - - some come in to rest after swimming in the ocean, some come in to do work on their laptops, and some practically live there.   Today there was a young lady who was obviously having a bad day. She came in looking like she was crying earlier, and asked to use the restroom. She then bought a vanilla chai and promptly spilled it in her car. She was going to pay for another one, but we made her another one for free. Peter said it was in part to make sure she doesn't have a breakdown and kill someone later. I wonder what sort of craziness that woman was going through today.  39 days until I'm back in Binghamton.   ***

      [17025]  Work was just brutal today. The heat didn't help ease the mood, nor did the  stupid customers today... I needed that beer from BJs...  One especially stupid one called another guy a "muslim worm" today... this same customer said Bustamante (a California Democrat) sucks because he caters for the poor, and plans on voting for Bush. That comment was uncalled for, much less the threats of violence... just for knocking on a bathroom door. The fucker deserves a reality check, as he's someone who doesn't seem to work and hangs out the beach ordering $3 drinks everyday. I plan on giving him decaf in the future so he chills the fuck out.  ***

      [17016]  I'm on swig #8 of gin alone in my room,  urlLink Unwritten Law  is playing and I've got a chicken patty in the toaster oven...  I've been working on a pen & ink drawing that's adapted from Durer's Erasmus of Rotterdam. I'm just sticking all sorts of different stuff in the background. This is basically an excuse to play with my new pen nibs and be  artistic  again. I don't feel productive right now, even though I am for the most part. I'm reading, writing (online), playing chess, working, working out, and even drawing.  I feel like working out has resulted in a visual difference, but I don't feel energized. I'm probably not eating sufficiently to cover the calorie burning.  Oh... I got an FM transmitter from Best Buy and it works pretty well. I need to burn some CDs to play in the car.  ***

      [17004]   Last night I had a dream that Janet and&nbsp;Steff were in my home cooking a&nbsp;huge feast. I got really pissed off at them, because they didn't ask for permission to use my kitchen, they made a mess, and were doing unsafe things (like having flammable stuff too close to the stove). I think that's the first dream in a long time, where I really felt pissed off. I'm sensitive about my kitchen... &nbsp;  I have 8 wins, 3 losses, and 4 draws on Chessmaster 9000... I'm working my way up the various computer players.   Last night Naomi, Jon, Derek, and I hung out with Nolan for the first time in years. That guy is funny.   I've got the day off today, but I'm not sure what I want to do. My room could use some cleaning. Maybe I'll do that.   You people should leave comments!  &nbsp;  ***

It was fun except for the part where Jon needs to improve his drunk coordination.  I'm sucking at Chessmaster 9000... I gotta get my chess skills back up...  Work at 2 PM today...  Looks like Amazon refunded me for the transmitter.   ***

      [16978]  I was telling Esther last night that I have a hard time drawing unless I'm violating the rules of HALT... the times when you're not supposed to drink.  H ungry.  A ngry.  L onely.  T ired.   There's a big part of my life in which I don't feel like I'm making the best of my youth. I'm living a life of uneasy content right now. I want to be hungry for something in life. I want the strength from anger. The reminders of my own humanity via suffering from loneliness. I want to feel weary and tired from all the abuse. My art is suffering from that.   The angry kid I was in high school produced such brilliant art. The hurt I felt from having a broken heart transferred onto canvas. I need that something...   A doctorate is something I know I want, but as I have stated many times in the past... was the timing right?  ***

      [16975]  Yesterday I spent most of the day at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences library in Beverly Hills reading 80+ year old books. The best book was on intellectual property law and how while authors won some rights, the artist / performer gets cut out of the scheme. I need to think about this some more and re-read Walter Benjamin and Bernard Edelman. Refreshing myself on Marx and labor power might be useful too.  The library was fucking freezing so I went to where I was planning on meeting Esther for dinner early. West Hollywood... such an interesting place. I went to go kill time by going into a bookstore I saw down the street. I was walking around looking for the non-fiction section, but then I realized that all they had was gay erotica and porn.   Dinner was cool, and then we hung out at Esther's place and had her homemade Young's Double Stout ice cream. Good stuff. It'd been a while since Esther and I really got a chance to hang out, so it was especially cool.   Oh and somehow she has the highest score on my Albert Quiz, with 90. What the hell is wrong with all you other friends that got shitty scores!!! Just kidding.  ***

      [16965]  Driving home at 12:30 AM through Laguna Canyon is not cool when you know someone dies there practically everyday. Anyway, last night a bunch of us co-workers hung out at Katrina's. It was cool.  Recently I was chatting with some regulars recently before my shift and they said some stuff that represented some of the things I don't like about society. One guy who hits the beach on a regular basis and gets $3 drinks, commented on how Democrats pander to the poor. I don't know where he got that idea. Last I checked no political party gives a crap about the poor. Also, is it such a bad thing to make sure that people don't fall through the cracks?   I dunno man... people buy into the false ideology of meritocracy and tell poor people to get a job, but don't take into account that they had the clothes and running water to look nice before an interview. People with money expect poor people, to work their up the economic ladder... but keep paying these people crap wages so they're stuck mowing their lawns, and flipping their burgers. How do you save money when you're making minimum wage and have bills to pay?  ***

We were sitting around Godfather's staring at our full glasses moaning about how full we were.  I pretty much just got home from a good tipping day of work. I might hang with co-workers later tonight.  I think I'll hit the gym after my lunch digests a bit.  ***

      [16942]  Work today 12 PM to 6 PM... I'm expecting lots of beach goers to order pain in the ass blended drinks. I better get some eye candy or big tips to compensate for the pain and suffering.  Last night I watched Spinal Tap with the girls. It was an entertaining movie, but I think somewhat over hyped.  I have a love / hate relationship with the guilty feeling you get, when you skip a day of working out.   I feel like sitting around drinking beer and painting today. However, I've got to go to work, and we'll probably be doing something for Derek's b-day later.  That's what's going on generally right now. Life is content, but being content makes my edgy... I get bored of it. There's a very self-destructive part of me that thinks I should be doing stupid things like saying things I shouldn't to people, abusing my body via jumping from high places and drinking.  I wanna say one last thing on the Casualities at Warped... what the fuck was up with changing the lyrics of Sham 69's "If The Kids Are United" to "If The Punks Are United"? That's such a load of bullshit. The change in lyrics reflects the mentality of many (not all) of their fans of musical, scene, image elitism. Instead of covering the wider demographic of "the kids" being united so they can't be divided, as in the original Sham 69 song... it's now "the punks" whoever the fuck the punks are. It's niche and branding.   Hah I wonder if Crystal is going to comment on this post.  ***

I think he points out some good stuff, but not in an as entertaining manner as when he was one stage.  My radio transmitter is in NY... grrr.... apparently when one changes your billing address on Amazon.com, it doesn't automatically change your shipping address.  I don't think I'll be going to many shows for the rest of the summer... well except Stiff Little Fingers and the Damned.  **

      There was some seriously poor planning by the people running the event. There wasn't enough parking both in and out of the fairgrounds, and the lack of adequate notification that good bands like  urlLink Anti-Flag , and the  urlLink Bouncing Souls  were "opening" was bad.  Anyway, I got into the venue and immediately felt like it was going to be a let down, but  urlLink Guttermouth 's mocking of the Casualties' fans lifted my spirits. See what happened was Guttermouth came on right after the Casualities and they made a joke about the Casualities' hair and time telling abilities. Then the fans got pissed off at Guttermouth. The lead singer Mark then proceded to rip on the fans through out the set. He'd be all like, "Where's my leather jacket?" "This is nothing but a fashion show!" "The Sex Pistols invented this thing called the swindle in which they make money off you... just like how you spent $$$ on hair products, make up, and women's clothes." That of course resulted in lots of trash being tossed at them. It was funny and reminds me of some past  urlLink comments I've made on some of those kids.  Then it was a fun  urlLink Bad Religion  set, an actually good NOFX set, the amazingly funny antics of  urlLink Van Stone , and Flogging Molly. Seeing 7 bands ain't bad.  ****

      [16903]  Fucking tourists this weekend have been rude and impatient. They weren't just rude at our coffee shop, but across the street to the pizza place workers also.  If they should yell at anyone, they should be yelling at the fucker in front of them ordering 10 complicated drinks, while chasing 10 kids, and fumbling for change... not the people working hard on your order.  This is why when I travel, I avoid going to touristy places during touristy times.   Today at least was generally a good day. I made a good amount in tips today. The after work I wandered up and down PCH in Laguna Beach and checked out galleries and stuff. After that I picked up some art supplies so that I can keep the right side of my brain  artistic . ***

      [17406]  Now playing:  Weezer  - Keep Fishin'  About a third of our calories are now eaten outside the home--nearly double the percentage in 1978. And when people dine out, they typically swallow more calories than when they eat at home. Women who eat out more than five times a week consume nearly 300 more calories per day than women who eat out less often. Children consume almost double the 440 calories they usually eat in a home-cooked meal.  I have no sympathy for people who can spend money eating out and then complain about gaining weight.  Now playing:  The Clash  - I'm Not Down  I was surfing  urlLink xanga  earlier, and I was reminded about how I generally don't have much in common with lots of the Asian-Americans at Binghamton. Many of them are just so... AZN. That's a subculture that I just don't really have any connection to. I don't listen to the music, I don't dress the fashion, or care about the same things. It's no wonder that when go to TASC stuff, I feel so out of place.  Now Playing:  Bad Religion  - Stranger Than Fiction  I didn't go out to hang with some people, because my health isn't 100% and I was tired from work. I needed a day of rest.  ***

      [17398]  Now playing:  The Killers  - Somebody Told Me  There's something creepy about blogs in that you have a journal of your life (in my case, the past 3 years of it) available to the public. You really don't know who is reading your blog. This thought came up as I looked at the referrals to my blog, and see weird Google search queries, and individual IP address hits.  Now playing:  Alkaline Trio  - Warbrain  The cyber lurking is weird, but at the same time, I don't have much to hide. I'd like to think I'm myself on here. I don't post anything here, that I wouldn't have a problem saying to someone in person. There is very little self censorship on my part.   Ok more managerial ranting. Our manager was supposed to be in at 7 AM, but didn't arrive until 11 AM. This was a day after implying to a co-worker that if she called in sick, she could lose her job. Talk about hypocrisy. The only good thing about it was he was around to criticize our work without doing any work himself.  Now playing:  Bad Religion  - The Fast Life  I guess the dumbass working there made it so that I won't miss leaving the job next, next week. I really had a great time working there this summer. I have awesome co-workers, the regular customers are awesome, and nothing beats seeing the Pacific Ocean everyday at work.  Customers hearing stories of what's been going on are upset that team members are are going to leave because of the new guy. Many have threatened to call the corporate office. Those threats made me feel nice that my work is appreciate.  Now playing:  Weezer  - The Good Life  Stiff Little Fingers is tomorrow night! Then Vegas on Sunday!  ***

      [17357]  In response to  urlLink Looking4Harmony 's  urlLink question , the old manager wanted to be transferred to an easier store to run. She was awesome, but the stress of our store got to her. I liked my job before this asswipe of a manager started working there.  Last night Katrina, Josh, Katie, Mike, Tony, and I had all sorts of bad things to say about the new manager. We basically all wanted to beat the guy up.   Anyway, Katrina, Jan, Josh, Amy and I went to Taco Loco last night and then wandered around Laguna. We checked out the various galleries, snagged some free wine, and the museum.  After that, Josh and I met up with Andy in Irvine. Then we we hung out with Ryan, Helen and Margaret.  Lots of names huh? Yea, yesterday was a long and busy day.  I've got to go work with that fucker of a manager in a few minutes.  **

      [17330]  I was pretty close to lashing out at my new manager today. Now I know that managers make changes, and we won't like some of them. However, if my job becomes more difficult for no good reason, then I start getting pissed. The guy is a fucking idiot. I got into work today and all the furniture was rearranged. The assistant manager said that when she showed up in the morning, many of the furniture was outside. The retail shelves were moved to a place where they were blocking the windows, resulting in customers complaining about the blocked ocean view. We had 5 customers rant about it and fill out complaint forms.  The guy literally ripped up the place so that we could clean things for the corporate monthly review. He made such a mess, that if the district manager came in early for a surprise review, we would have failed miserably. Things weren't where they should be, and boxes were all over the place in the back.  He also decided to change the motherboard on one of the registers, and it fucked up the system for a good while too. As far as I know, only one register is still working even now. I don't even know why he changed the motherboard on the register, as that register was working fine. The working register is probably still spewing out receipts every few minutes as well.  It was also bad, because he gave us lots of extra crap to do, in addition to serving our customers on a busy day. He had the nerve to give me a "what the fuck are you doing" look when I was doing some of the really stupid tasks on his list. Then he wanted to make sure I was putting the beans back on the shelves in order, because he went through them last night. I was tempted to say, they're probably not in order to begin with because I was finding lots of out of place bags of beans.  What really pissed me off was that in his tearing up of the place, our stuff in the worker's locker got thrown out. I had to retrieve our stuff from the dumpster.  I came back and essentially blamed him in a harsh tone of voice. Trying to restrain myself from cursing. If I had lost my backpack full of books, I would have started cursing and walked off the job. I don't think I could work under a fucktard that'd cost me over $100 in books and other stuff. The pussy got all defensive, blaming others for his own stupidity.   ***

      [17321]  Leave more comments people!   Now playing:  Rancid  - Reconciliation  A lazy day, except for the foccacia sandwich I made, and the Stiff Little Fingers tickets that I got. Oh and I also got phone service set up for Binghamton. (22 days away).  I spent most of the day watching movies. I watched  The Punisher  and  The  Girl Next Door .  Now playing:  Bad Religion  - Mediocrity  The Punisher was alright. It was bad, but wasn't great. I think the movie was afraid to go too far in terms of brutality. Instead it offered cartoonish violence. Also Kevin Nash looked damn silly in it.   The Girl Next Door was a sort of Pretty Woman story, only with teenagers and porn stars. It's basically a love makes you a better person story. This wasn't really a bad movie, but it was just decent enough to decently kill some time today.   Now playing:  Ataris  - Boys of Summer (cover)  Does love make you a better person? Call my a cynical bastard, but celebrity stalkers, and people in abusive relationships are examples of love being a bad thing. Then again I'm a person who makes jokes about corpses, torturing animals, and other things. That might explain my lack of a serious relationship in a while.   There should be some more fun going on tomorrow night.  ***

      [17300]  Now playing:  Bad Religion  - In So Many Ways  I saw the  Manchurian Canidate  yesterday afternoon. It was really good. I liked the twist in the end that played off the ambiguities in the original movie. In the original we were left wondering if Marco was brainwashed and Rose was his handler.  I think the movie could have really pushed things if they had included stuff like how the Manchurian Corporation was tied to nations that fund terrorists. In the original movie the Communist Chinese were linked to the Russians.  Now playing:  Faithless  - Weapons of Mass Destruction  I also went out for a few beers with Brandon and Andy last night. It was cool. Sharman couldn't make it though.  ***

      [17288]  I might not know myself, but I enjoy trying to "read" the people I come across.  For example, the other day at work there was a pretty good looking girl... ok maybe woman might be a better word, that came in. In terms of clothing, disposition, and voice, she struck me as someone that has self-esteem issues. On a warm summer day, she was covered in light clothing and large brimmed hat. The vibe I got from her personality, I'd also guess that she's one of those people who collect things. I don't know what, but she just seemed like someone who collects stupid shit. She was alone, and I get the feeling she was in Laguna Beach on vacation. Either from a far flung part of SoCal or from a bus tour. The vibe I get from her is that she is someone who feels a lack of control in life.  Another girl, who I described to Katrina as "all sorts of fucked up" recently probably has some interesting / bad stuff in her past. I think it's not a simply a pretentious stuck of OC thing for her. There's just something about her behavior that suggests some deep problems.   I just watched  Walking Tall  and  Hellboy . Both decent movies.  I'm also playing a ROM Link's Awakening on my cell phone right now. Fun stuff. It's supposed to be the real sequel to Link to the Past for SNES.  ***

      [17277]  Now playing:  The Clash  - Lost In The Supermarket  Work was not fun today. I was tired. Although I did see Rick Bassman of UPW in the store today and there were talks of a coup d'etat.  I'm feeling like this summer isn't nearly as fun as it could or should be. Not enough madness is going on. No drama. Not as much wild stuff... hopefully next weekend will make up for it.  Now playing:  Marilyn Manson  - Beautiful People  There's a part of me that wonders if I'm being the person that I want to be. Not as much the part of me doing what I want, but me actually being me. Who exactly is Albert? More than what I do, beyond what I say I believe. I've said that people don't really know me, but then again do I really know myself?  ***

      [17263]  Now playing:  All  - Long Distance  Once again Orange County proves to be a small place. A girl from junior high came into the store yesterday. She was all like, you look familiar. Did I go to high school with you? I blankly stared for a bit, and then was like, I went to Irvine. Did you go to Sierra Vista? You're Eunice right? Then there was a bit more of the basic hello stuff and taking her order.  Now playing:  Division of Laura Lee  - Access Identity  I went to a party with Anna, Katrina, and Josh last night. It was cool. There was champagne table tennis. Can smashing. I also vomited when I got home. So yea... it was good. The weird thing is that the booze really hit me at home, more so than at the party. I was all out of it when I woke up in the middle of the night to throw up.  Now playing:  Boy Sets Fire  - Still Waiting For The Punchlin  I have to go to work in an hour and a half. This is so not gonna be fun. I would really prefer to sleep all day today.  **
