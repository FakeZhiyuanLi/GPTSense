       Oddly enough, the day started with Mr JCB blocking the road again. A real WTF moment in my mornings that is. I'm getting tempted to jump out of my car and ask him if he is actually aware of other people around him. But then again, he'll probably show his IQ by replying with 'UG?' and I'd lump him or someting!  Work wasn't too bad today... other than that I had to now pack away all the training PC's as soon as I walked in. I asked my work collegues why is it that they come in and sit down, surf a bit of news and drink coffee and chat about utter bollocks and I've not even sat at my desk yet and I'm lugging stuff around. You can imagine the silence that followed. Health-wise, I felt a bit odd today, one of those 'ffs I need a crap' and getting there to sit and stare at the wall for a few minutes and nothing happen but get a sore ring. Bloody hate that!  Picked up my kids for a hours after work which is always a highlight. My twins are nearly 8 years old now so chatting about stuff can be a real laugh. Very rare occurance happened where I gave my ex-wife a lift to work when picking up the kids. It's VERY odd that... her in the car, me trying not to make any conversation :)  Dropped the kids off at 8pm, then went back to work *SHOCK*. I had to meet up with a developer who is coding a system for us and his only time he can meet with me is after 8pm when he gets home from his day job. Not on really is it. So, after spending 3.5hrs going over database schemas and XML I finally got home at 11:30pm.  I opened a bottle of wine, sat back, had a smoke, and thought I'd update this... so here I am now typing in real-time with my thoughts, tiredness and a dicky tummy.   ...pause...  If you wondered where I went just then, I was reading back what I had written. :)  Nearly time for me to hit the sack... gonna have a little read of my book which I'll fill ya all in on another day!  TTFN!

       So, my first thoughts on this day so far. Well, not so far as more 'up to this point in the evening when I'm thinking of going to bed'.  Today started a bit rushed.  I live in a new house, and the builders who are still making the rest of the road are really, REALLY pissing me off. Every morning, at 07:45 without fail, a JCB (back-hoe digger thing) always blocks the outbound lane out of my estate. Handy since most people here seem to leave for work at that time. The driver seems to have a fetish with stiring up dry-mix concrete for the kerb stones they are laying while they get ready to finish the roads. Still, it's annoying that this idiot knows full well he sits there holding up traffic for ages and yet does it every morning. Amazing how some peoples brains work isn't it.  So, I got in to work today at 08:05 or there abouts. Me being the IT bod in the company I work for I had to set up a few PC's for a training day for a few new-users on our system. I don't host it, just set the stuff up.   I nicely managed to slice my finger open on a PC case (...there's a topic for a random thought... why are some PC cases razor sharp?...) so splattered blood all over my shirt. Even more handy was the fact I had a meeting quite soon with a supplier, and didn't think it best I turned up in a shirt covered in blood.  On the way to my meeting (which was at a branch office 30 miles away) I nipped home to get a clean shirt. In mild panic, I really couldn't do with ironing another shirt so threw on a T-shirt. Bugger my luck that it didn't seem to be clean... ffs. So, changed to another, ran out the house and jumped in my car and off I sped to my meeting. On the way, I quite uncalmly noticed the T-shirt I threw on was also not clean either. Like WTF moment or what!. So, wearing a jacket (and today wasn't exactly cold here!) I sat in this meeting feeling a complete lemon.  I left the meeting, went home, and changed AGAIN, where the rest of my day was pretty uneventful and I got on with the stuff I needed to get on with.  This evening was a bit mad. Me and my girlfriend of 4 years started talking about the nutty stuff. Engaugements. Marriage. Babies. We ended up looking for rings we liked. I'm kinda sold on Tungsten, looks fab, and hard as nails. We'll see huh!. I decided I wanted an engaugement ring myself, nothing gay lookin', maybe a narrow band where I can then get a larger band to sit with it when we marry. Sounded nice to me :)  So the world knows, I'm divorced. Very happily divorced in fact. I had a very rocky marriage which very oddly produced two of the most wonderful, caring and loving kids. Twins too. Love 'em :) So, being round the block already, it feels odd to be contemplating marriage again, but it's more exciting this time, feels much more right. Fingers crossed huh :)  It's 23:30, I've had a few drinkies, done a bit of work that I needed to get done, and sitting here thinking about bed. I know first thing tomorrow I'll need to 'un'setup the training stuff first thing, lets hope I don't slice another finger!  Thought for the day: Why is it, when driving as mad as a hatter, there's always someone else driving just as looney as you!?  G'night!

       Welcome to my Blog. For those not in the know, a Blog is a kinda forum where I post shit about my day, and anyone who feels like it can post comments or stuff against what I write.   I'm probably going to be giving daily updates of my somewhat normal life mainly as an online diary of what I get up to at any given time. Boring shit maybe... but might serve as insightful to me as time passes.  So, on with the show...
