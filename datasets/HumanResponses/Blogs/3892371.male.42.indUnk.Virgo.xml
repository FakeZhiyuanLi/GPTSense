       Friday 26th March 2004  (click the image)      urlLink    I wish I'd brought my notepad, not that I have one...maybe next time. Some good pints, some very good pints. Too much walking because of the trip to Whitworth Art Gallery...but if you click on the above image, one of the funniest incidents I have ever seen. It really happened to Paul...ha ha A car reversed by the kerb side and just caught a plastic bottle top which catapulted right at Paul's head... Rob   "Could have had his eye out." Terry "Aye" Paul  "Toilet Twiddler"

      A professor stood before his Philosophy 101 class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly, he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.  The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous - - yes.  The professor then produced two cans of beer from under the table and proceeded to pour the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.  "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - - your family, your partner, your health, your children, your friends, your favorite passions - - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.  The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff."  "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing. Play another 18. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal."  "Take care of the golf balls first - - the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."  One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the beer represented.  The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of beers."

      first peel and chop half a large onion, then peel and chop three cloves of garlic, then peel and chop half a red pepper, then peel and chop a handful of mushrooms...Fry these in a large pan with a bit of oil... then add one pound of mincemeat and fry until brown...After that add two dessert spoons of curry powder (to taste) with half a teaspoon of chili powder....Chuck in a large tin of tomatos and mix it in...and finally add a bit of bisto(about two teaspoons)...measures are subject to taste and must be experimented with (although too much salt is not recommended!)...mmmmm..woodgenome

      yes, i was robbed!... this prostitute intercepted me as i crossed from the navi to the eagle...she kept grabbing hold of me so i kept saying "i don't want any business" and "leave me alone" etc. By the time i realised what had happened she was away, and i was Â£15 lighter...i chased her and actually got hold of her but she started screaming so i decided to give it up as a bad job...i went in the eagle but realised that i hadn't enough change for a pint (thinking i could borrow some money off Fred when he came in) so decided to go to the hole in the wall... on my way back to town the prostitute was there with her pimp, who came running over (near whittingtons) he attacked me, so we had a bit of a scuffle and he realised he wasn't getting anywhere,..he kept saying (to streamline taxis) "call the police"...i wish they would have been there! Anyhow, they buggered off, leaving me out of breath and somewhat distraught in streamline taxi rank!..A guy came in saying "i saw all that!, if you want to call the police i'm willing to back you up" so i told him that i didn't think it would be worth it...end of story QED...I'm alive to tell the tale, but older and wiser!

      All change and change again.... He got the sack last October. After outrageously changing his hair style, if not his mincing gate, he (boy girl thing) eventually got a place at Manchester Airport..IT liaison with Ops (not perfect casting I fear...fairly short lived therefore) and now GUS in Manchester. Andy O still with us but lots and lots of talks with his mate Seedy so not long until re united in a nauseating Simon Bates type Our Tune style get together (naked star jumps and CDM's place during Dungeons and Dragons). Yes I am the boss for what it is worth....50 redundancies on the way. Me and Charles holding the baby. Phil has been replaced....will finish at end of September. Yours Rich, Old and tired. Come back all is forgiven. I want to take them all for a beer next week....fancy a gallon? Yorkshire County Champions 2001, Goughy about to save England with the bat 33 to avoid the follow on in the morning...a good session to watch. PS Dahoon wants his clubs back. ARSE
