      Today was the day that we had to go and verify our marks.  I did well in co-op, 94%, fairly well in calculus 80% and shitty in english, 79%.  I think that my english teacher should quit teaching, because he sucks at it.     After this, Steph, Dave, Tim and I went downtown to do some shopping and then go for lunch at this all you can eat sushi place.    On the way down, we find out that Dave can't drive, because when making a turn he takes out a chunk of the median.  He scared the living shit out of us.  We park in this Tim Horton's parking lot, and walk across to this "Metro" place.  Its closed, but it looks like some fag shop.  Then Steph mentions that the owner's gay so me and Tim can't make any derogatory comments.  The place ends up being closed, so we head on to Jackson Square. Has that mall ever gone down the shitter.  While we're at the cinema, we loose Steph and start panicking.  Appearently she was in the back room of the shoe store with the owner. (wink, wink).  But we found her and then went to the second cup to get iced hot chocolates.    We then go to some pot shop where they sell bongs and shit.  It was hilarious, there was this guy in a business suit who's at the coutner, and then goes and sits down with an issue of "high times".  Steph was trying to find something to hide her cannibus in.   We then went to some thrift shop with clothes from 1960.  Me and Tim couldn't stand the place so we wait outside the store making comments about the low-lifes that are walking by, until Tim starts to recongize them and says that we need to get out of there.    Now the best part, the restaurant.  Its all you can eat, and its sushi.  Dave really didn't have full control of the chopsticks, so it was comical how he was eating.  I ate way too much.  And was feeling sick for a few hours.  The food was soooo good.  After the sushi, we went back to the metro store, they had this sic lunchbox with the last supper on it and all sorts of shit that was cool.  Steph bought a pair of jeans.    We then went to Dave and Tim's old school to meet the teacher that made them what they are today.  If only there were more teachers like that.  Its a good thing he didn't recognize me, as I've screwed him over in the past during basketball games.  Then we dropped Tim off at home, and then i left, and I believe that Dave and Steph went to see terminal.    That's it, there's nothing else to say, except that Canadians are idiots for electing Paul Martin as prime minister.  I forgot a key event that happened during this eventful day.  A full recap of it is available on my friend Tim's blog site, the fucker uses Xanga, when Blogger is much better.   http://www.xanga.com/tlo182

      Today marked the 38th federal general election in Canada, and can you say dissapointing.  The fucking Liberals won with 135 seats.  Thank god its a minority.  I can't believe that Canadians are stupid enough to put Martin back in power.  He wasted billions on the sponsorship scandal and will send this country down the drain.  He's giving the final hit on the head to the nails that Trudeau put in our coffin 20 years ago.  And Jack Layton, don't get me started on him.  Give the man a fucking hammer and have him hit fruit.  He looks and acts like that Gallagher comedian guy.  Harper, now there's a leader, he would've led this country to economic prosperity, with low taxes and increased federal funding.  But you Canadians made your choice, and now you're gonna have to live with it.  I commend all the Conservative candidates accross the country, for a campaign well done.  Even though you couldn't all win, you made a dent in the Liberal stronghold of the past.  In the next election the conservatives will see power.  I forsee an election in a years time and hopefully the Liberals won't live to see the end of it.

      So I was looking around the web, and this new service, gmail, caught my eye.  I can't believe that they're offering 1 GB of storage.  Now, all I have to do is find out how to get an account.  If anyone has any suggestions, please drop me a line.

      This wasn't the most interesting day, but it had its good points.  First Dave calls me up and tells me he's gonna pick me up, cause me, Dave, Allie and Matt are going to see Spiderman on the opening day.  I'm not sure if its in this blog, but the last time i went to see somehting on opening day, the shit really hit the fan.  But anyways, the movie was pretty good and uneventful, its what happened afterwards that really shocked me.  Me and Dave have this good friend, Stephanie, and out of the blue, Steph calls Dave up and tells us to come over, as her parents have left her home alone.  Now, until that point in time, I have never set foot in her house before.  FUCKING AMAZING MANSION is what Steph lives in.  It's huge and gorgeous.    Well getting back to the story, we get to Steph's house, and we go in, and she tells us that she doesn't know how to cook.  So me, being the gourmet I am, make her kraft dinner for the next day.  She opens a beer up, and I have 2 sips and all of a sudden I felt trashed.  I'm not sure why because I had a full stomach, but I was out of it.  Anyways, in the end, we were going to bring Steph to Tim's house, but his dad was up, so she came with Dave to drop all of us off.  We arranged that the next day we'd go over to her house and do shit.

      Well it seems that I've been away from this site for over a month.  Let's recap the month of July (in no particular order, just a listing of the shit i've done):  1. Got a sick-ass job as a statistician for the Candian Football League (CFL). They pay me $50 a game to type on a computer. And I get free food and free reign of the press-box. Its awesome I get all the media guides I want, and I get to watch the football game from a dry and warm box.  2. Went to summer school. What shit that was. I took grade 12 U english to fast-track. My teacher was a guy but had a higher pitched voice than a woman's shriek. It was soooo fucking wierd. The guy was so naive to, people were gone for half the day and he didn't do shit about it. He also left the exam in the classroom while he left. But then some dumb-ass got caught looking at it, and he re-wrote it. I got an 84% in that course. That's better than if I took it in real school, because apparently the teacher I was supposed to have thinks that 70% is an extremely good mark in her class. What a nutjob.  3. Had some experience with the term. "flaming cunt" [ don't ask ]  4. Went to a basketball referees camp. It was great, I drank soo much beer. I loved it, it combined the things I love, reffereeing, booze and a few hot women. Good times.  5. House-sitting, I get to stay at a relative's house while they're out of the country, great fucking times. I should have a party before they come back.  I think that's it. I know that next week I'm off to another basketball official's camp, and then hopefully a road trip down to the US to do some cheap shopping.  I'm also looking for a girlfriend, so any single females around age 17-18 in southern ontario who are interested and are somewhat compatible with me drop me a line.  Thanks.  Anyways until next time, "Internet world, go fuck yourself"  C Ya
