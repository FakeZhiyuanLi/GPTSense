      yo estoy cansadissima. son las siete y el wedding estuvo very good. we (all I think) drank a lot and el mio castellano se divento fantastico. Miguelito me miro toda la noche con un aire y unos 'pufs' di reprovacion. No lo se porque...pero preguntare! Darkness helped me with my make up. She does it very very well. After 34 years of plainess I decided I had to try a bit of make up and hair style. It is all part of my new philosophy: be open to new experiences. Actually it is not so new...the experiences are. Looked good but it is not really my world. I fell on the floor dancing!! That was the hard part...humiliating. i dont know if people noticed but even now...when I write I blush. rsrsrsrsrsrs. Valentin se enborracho de una forma que no o mai visto! But I think he had fun. Danced anyway and that is not part of his desired skills. But who knows...maybe he has a John Travolta hidden inside just waiting for some glasses of wine to come out!!! rsrsrsrs  I'll have a shower now and write more about the wedding later on. The day is beautiful and I have to work. Mate and work. Although picnic in the park would be a much nicer idea. There is a dry white snow outside. it's been some days it is springsnowing. Poor people with allergies!! Spring brings blackbirds, sun and suffering for some.

      Being such a diverse bunch of people in this world we should speak esperanto but we don't. It doesn't really matter though because...whatever language we are creating by mixing portuguese, italian, german, castellano, english... ... ... we have our especial way of understanding each other! Ciao. Volver al traballo!

      I should have introduced some of the people who live with me in my magical world before as I have already talked about them. They all come from completely different parts of the world and have different expectations and experiences about and in life...and that is what makes my world magical. The first one is my very very good friend Valentin. He is one of the most inteligent and sensitive guys I know and he wanted to be an astronaut but ended up being an artist (in the boldest sense). But he is not frustrated. He really enjoys it and we have the best times of our magical lives together. He is the only one of my friends that is aware of our magical existence. The others just exist. I didn't say just in a bad way. The thing is that I don't believe they noticed the magical bit of it. And maybe it is better not to notice it...just live it. Today i am going to the wedding with Valentin. It will be more magical than never. Party dress and suit in a wedding in Oxford rsrsrs!! In the wedding we will meet Miguelito, another good and interesting friend. it is also magical how I discover or 'uncover' my friends little by little. I start with a first image that I create I don't know based on what and as I get closer to them the image transforms into surprisingly interesting thousands of fragments that dont always go together. We are fragmented personalities in my magical world (just to use Valentin's favourite word). Miguelito is a good friend and we are closer in emails than  in vivo  (rsrsrs). Branca de Neve is one of the few women in this world and is very present in Valentin's life and because I am also part of his life, she became part of mine. I am just realizing that my magical world is masculin!!! Couldn't be different, could it?!! I am so predictable. There are three other guyfriends that at the moment are a bit far away from me but are very important part of my life as well: President, Dipsy and Po. There are many others but they are coadjuvantes in the story. There is one who is sometimes part of the magical world and sometimes not and her name is Darkness (don't take the maning of the word dark as 'bad'...no prejudices in this world!!). If she could only relax and enjoy life more she wouldn't have so many days of 'bad mood'. She is a very nice girl but still with a long life learning process in front of her. That is it!! I presented some of them. Others may come and some of these may leave. I'll let you know...

      I felt sick last night. I don't know if it was the quiche...I cant stand this food anymore and I am not a 'complainer' person but can't stand it...pasta and pesto is the combination I hate most nowadays and at the same time the one I eat everyday. But I have to admit: it is my own fault and incompetence! I should do something about it. One day...when I started to smell and fell the spring in my skin and when the blackbirds started to sing again...I migrated to the packed salads!! Spring...Summer: Salad!!! What a great idea: no fat, no need to wait, not much work: ready salads...it is only to mix with parma ham and a bit of olives or whatever and eat but then I saw the worst: the article about the danger of the packed salads!! I cant really remember anymore what is the problem (my memory is faulty and ... unreplaceable) but it is something related to what they do to preserve the freshness of the leaves...anyway...in the end of the day they want to say that packed salad kills you...what doesn't?!?! But...just in case...for now I decided to give up the salad and go back to pasta...I have to find a strong argument that will make me to migrate from pasta to something else...couscous perhaps...

      yesterday we went to the eights. Me, Valentin and Branca de Neve the boat races between the colleges of the oxford university. the best thing of the race weren't the boats but the people. Alumni in their kind of ridiculous jackets and hats. And lots of barbarian teenagers listening to cheesy music and drinking beer and for many times, throwing beers at themselves. It is a magical barbarian world!! But it is not that bad and although my description might seem bad, it is not. It is just magically with lots of comically ugly and barbarian people living in a cheese and ridiculously posh world. That is it. Pimms is good. It was the first time I had it and burned burgers as well. Today is the wedding day...not mine...someone I barely know that following the mood of a party where we met decided to invite me and my friend. I like this cool kind of people. Feel like...do it!! The wedding will be a t Freud's. A church which was converted into a bar. It will be a mix of mexican-english type of people and I am very curious to see how lating and anglo-saxons aesthetics combine together in an environment like this. Tomorrow I'll have lots to tell. I might see people in havaianas and lantejoulas.

      estranha essa dinamica de comunicacao com diferentes pessoas. Uns preferem emails, outros texts, outros so telefonam, outros so ao vivo. Sao diferentes ansiedades ou a mesma ansiedade por diferentes meios. e porque eh tao mas tao mais facil 'conversar' por meios eletronicos do que ao vivo? It is easier, more comfortable and at the same time allows the 'double meanings' that I like so much. Chuvisca na terra da rainha. Tinhamos combinado um picnic...ia ligar para uns, passar um text para outros, passar um email para outro e encontrar ainda outro mais tarde mas acho que nao vai rolar. Ainda assim queria me encontrar com todos eles. Acho que eu tenho uma 'disfuncao sentimental'... Qualquer pessoa interessante me seduz...so pelo fato de ser interessante em algum momento...que isso, acho que to enlouquecendo. Ou estamos todos loucos por nao sermos sempre assim?!?! Qual sera a ordem?

      decidi comecar esse blog pra ver qual eh. estou testando varias coisas na internet que nunca tinha utilizado antes. a completely new world. estranha essa sensacao de escrever para mim e para o mundo ao mesmo tempo. o mais estranho eh ficar meia hora pensando se vou escrever em portugues ou ingles. tem algumas coisas que eu digo em ingles que nao diria em portugues. another day I was playing with a spanish speaker friend about speaking our own languages. So far we had spoken only english and suddenly...we were behaving and seeming completely different people. Language does change something. I don't know...it is the way we express ourselves. we noticed that even our face expressions change. crazy. to achando que vou passar mais horas na frente do computador por causa desse blog do que jamais imaginei...tomara que nao...

      I am exhausted!! Life is seeming so real and other people's little actions and behavoiours are overwhealming with surprise. People are so sensitive and immerse in their own worlds that whenever you rebel yourself from the socially agreed pattern of behaviour you see very very scary things. But that is also amazing. Basta uma simples change na forma de agir e  se comunicar e o mundo todo se transforma. Nunca considerei tao certa a teoria dos fractalis. eh isso ai juval. eh impressioannte como menstruacao e fudge from Whitby are closer than I ever imagined. And like that it goes...everything is related and we are all the time in friction and sometimes we explode. and that is it. life in community.

      Let's say that I found in you a lightness that was missing in my life. A calm and light way of having a conversation. A laugh, a less academic way of talking, music. A relief.

      got fed up of having characters...will change everyone into letters. childish. if you ever read this you will know that at one point I had people such as branca de neve, valentin, miguelito, etc, etc, etc. But that is it. Blogs are good because you change the past with not leaving any track. and that is very much me...although I can' really do it...that how I would like it to be...or not... Actually i have no principles, no assumptions, nothing. i just live and adapt or adapt.

      Novamente lutando para recomecar. Addictions are a danger in everysense. Ontem consegui trablahar um pouco mas depois do almoco resolvi vir pra universidade e pronto...nao fiz mais nada. nada nao...fiz climbing das 4 as 6 e research barbecue das 6 as 10. To um pouco preocupada com o meu doutorado e com esse caso de estudo...actually i am fed up of everything and this reflects in my attitudes in everyother area of my life. i think I am going insane... Really insane...doing things that I shouldn't be doing or ... no...I am not doing anything but this is even worse because I can do many things without doing them...rsrsrs...a bit confusing isn't it. can someone be addicted to another person that she/he barely knows? Is it possible? I believe you can be attracted but addicted? Not only sexually attracted...I don't know...i am very confused and my personal confusion is affecting and interfering in other people's lives and that is bad. Met J last night. I did so many mistakes since I started to relate myself to other man...other than G. And I am starting to feel bad. Now he thinks it is 'nice' (I hate nice...someone else said that nice wasn't nice but I cant rememeber...I'll ask Valentin) to meet occasionally...por acaso. I think i said something like that once that we were trying to meet already for a month and never worked and he totally agreed and went for it. And it bothers me...hourly sex...fuck I don't want it...I don't like it... I wanted part-time relationships...now I feel like fulltime...but this is because i am feeling very sensitive because I'll have to leave my magical world for some months, and what do i get? hourly (not paid) relationships...era so o que me faltava... enfim...I am going around like my drumming class. How can i be addicted to someone?! How can someone be addicted to me?! It is not real...it is all part of this esquizofrenic bubble we all live. Otherwise it wouldn't happen. But why not? i don't know. i am confused...

      Estou aqui lutando pra comecar a trabalhar no meu doutorado de novo mas nao eh facil. Simplesmente nao da vontade. O final de semana foi otimo. A viagem de Stan foi meio surreal. Meia hora depois de sairmos, furou o pneu. Para pra trocar e comprar crisps e chocolate!! Talvez esse seja a ideia de comida saudavel dos ingleses mas eu, que sou fa de yakult e yogurte probiotico fiquei meio que intoxicada, ainda mais depois do fry up no domingo pela manha. Essa parte da comida foi impressionante. Eh mais uma daqueles radicalismos conceituais que eu tenho: esporte tem que vir acompanhado de comida saudavel. Transglobal underground in Exeter - Phoenix Arts Centre. A musica eh otima mesmo mas legal foram os fantoches gigantes e o ar de rave. Acampamos em um dos circulos de pedra em Dartmoor. Dia seguinte banho no rio e escalar HoundTor... Magico final de semana.

      Acordei sentindo toda aquela tristeza que foi se esvanecendo ao longo do dia as i went on interacting with people. Sempre assim. Very predictable although unavoidable. Hoje recebi mais uma poesia do meu landlord. Ainda nao contei mas tenho um landlord de 90 anos que me deixa poemas escritos por ele e dedicados a mim no pe da minha escada. Nao sempre nem todos os dias como conto exagerando um pouco mas seguidamente...Somente in my magical world i would become a muse for a 90 years old men. I like it.  FOR L  A man of 90 can't well choose Who might play the part of muse. Lucky must indeed he be To find one of 33 (Or even if she's 34, No matter if it's less or more).  You like my poems, as you say, So I'll be sad when you're away (A word perhaps too strong is 'sad' - For G though he will be glad).  To keep in touch, when out of sight, A letter you could sometimes write - Then, if there were encouragement, Poems in future could be sent.  RCM, 31/5/04  So love is about encouragement and not something that happens magically!! Essa ideia de que o amor eh uma coisa quase 'divina' me irrita (fazia horas que nao escrevia essa palavra em portugues rsrsrs). Eh muito Paulo Coelho pro meu gosto. Eh reactive and not proactive and proactive is my word although I am getting tired of it. E porque eu nao posso me apaixonar ou pelo menos me interessar e encorajar todo mundo ao mesmo tempo?! So tem gente interessante na minha volta seja por um motivo ou por outro... Mas obviamente que nao posso. To comecando a achar que tenho uma disfuncao afetiva...ou eu tenho ou o resto do mundo tem. Melhor achar que eh o resto do mundo. Enfim...acabei o meu trabalho agorita. 12.20. Ainda que nao muito satisfeita vou dar por encerrado e esperar feedback. vou enviar uma copia para o miguelito que tambem esta tendo problemas de concentracao e acho que um chocolate quente vai me fazer girar menos na cama e nao acordar enjoada. E depois chocolate parece que tem a mesma substancia da alface que estimula a sensacao de felicidade. Mas nao lembro mais...tenho que descobrir qual eh o alimento que estimula a memoria porque a minha ta indo pro beleleu.

      Hoje acordei com um humor estranho. É bom acordar ao lado de alguém... perguntar como foi a noite, discutir o café da manhã. Levantar aos poucos, encher a casa de música, comer e ser comido. Já ri, já chorei, já fiquei braba, já me acalmei,&nbsp;nem sei... tudo uma mistura. E uma clareza sobre o que tem que ser feito alucinante. Mas uma saudade e um sentimento de incapacidade que não saem da volta. Xô! Preciso de um plano... um plano que organize o meu mundo, um plano que me faça poder acordar ao lado de alguém...sem preocupações, sem problemas, sem outros... um plano de uma vida light... um plano... isso é o que eu preciso.

      Noite no Cruz com direito à churras na bandeija, pão, cachaça, cerveja, gritaria, bebedeira&nbsp;e fumaça de cigarro. Um dos melhores lugares em Pelotas nas sextas-feiras atualmente (porque só nas sextas eu não sei). Dei risada, me desliguei, viajei, voltei, ri mais e saí com os olhos vermelhos e ardendos. Agora&nbsp;tô curtindo uma das&nbsp;minhas duas&nbsp;novas fixações: o orkut! Indescritivelmente fascinante entrar no mundo das outras pessoas. Ainda não entendi bem a idéia mas já senti que vou ficar fascinada navegando pelas conexões do orkut. A outra é o AIR que não me sai da cabeça... Air na cabeça... dia e noite. todo minuto... mais ou menos como essa chiba que eu não consigo parar de tão boa... Dias de 'ar na cabeça' literalmente se é que dá....

      Oi,  &nbsp;  Acho que essa foi a melhor noite desde que cheguei. Tô sozinha desde as 7:30 e&nbsp;resolvi fumar ficar ouvindo música e revendo a minha vida em Oxford pelas fotos. Primeira vez sozinha... Que alívio.  I am inside of a room with the same ´parenti&nbsp;é serpenti´ estufa&nbsp;on now for hours... it is lacking a bit of oxigene but it is the first time i am not feeling cold since i arrived. Very comfortable.  I am listening to Air... a very good band. Very good music. They experiment a lot with different sounds...,&nbsp;the lyrics varie from crap&nbsp;to very nice.  It is a pity you are not here with me... we would go dancing today... there are some places with very good music to dance in here... I think you would like it...the music and the places. And we would dance until six in the morning!!&nbsp;Would you manage it?!  The time to go out dancing is about 12 or 1am and depending on the place, even later... before we almost always go to a restaurant.&nbsp; When I was around 18/20, the basement of the School of Law in the university was always a very good place to go dancing... very good music... it was&nbsp;a kind of students union (?) (diretório acadêmico in portuguese) during daytime and at nigth they would put some music, turn the lights off and that is it... very very simple and it would start after 3am and we would dance until lunch time!!! Unbelievable and a wonderful time... very very good. I had forgotten that....Era 'direito' mas mais torto impossível.  ok. But you are not here so we wont go dancing...what will we do then..??.. sleep?...?? dream of each other? Is that all?  When would I imagine I would be talking to an email??

      It is now 4.20 am and i am fully awake. We had a long conversation about memory but we already forgot it. We are very similar and i am discovering it now. The printer makes a repetitive noise ... hypnotic. It could be a rainy sunday afternoon of a holiday and we would be laughing about the mother that smoked a joint in the loo and about the apparent colan and about the longest hair in he world. And we would be smoking and laughing. New people new visions of the world. I should learn how to be totally there for a glass of water. I know it doesnt make much sense but i am awake and it is 4.37! Nonsense time...

      sunday siesta  urlLink     Pity... no climbing today. The weather was crap in the morning. Summer day after lunch. Siesta at Márcia´s house. A perfect day. 4 more interviews starting tomorrow and finishing on tuesday. I am a bit tired of it already. Can´t wait to go to POA and from there to Manaus. Need sun... more than the one I got at the siesta... Need water to swim... river, sea,&nbsp;need forest... need green... density, dampness, heat.

      the morning interview is done and I have already booked a course on 3d for urban environments with this friend of mine for when i come back. He says i mustn´t leave without him teaching me that. We use to work together when I was teaching at UCPel mixing the contents of his subject '3d for architecture and urbanism' and mine which was an 'urban design project for&nbsp;a conservation area'. It was a great experience but very very difficult. he is one of those people who will be part of my life forever even though we dont talk and meet too much...&nbsp;but the&nbsp;SURPRISE&nbsp;of the morning&nbsp;was that&nbsp;I met an old student of mine called Índio because of his very long dark hair and he climbs... and on&nbsp;sunday&nbsp;early morning&nbsp;we will go climbing at the "pedreira de pelotas"... a place where there is stone extraction... it is only granite...&nbsp;i am not sure if it is easy or not to climb granite... i must study the different types of stones and etc... and either next weekend or in the first weekend&nbsp;after the amazon, depending on the weather) we will go camping and climbing in a place which is a bit further away from Pelotas... some days start not very well but end up being the best days... life starts to move again... to move up rsrs.

      I am in a much better mood today. Still not wanting to do the workshop with the elderly people... I already know how it is going to be and I am not in the mood of facing it but... there is no alternative and as soon as i do it I´ll feel relieved... I feel like going out and seeing people again... feel like doing things... going out... running... cycling... dancing... Dancing is a good idea... Helps to liberate the toxins... Now I have to go... Want to go to the post office to send bits of pelotas to people who doesn´t have a clue about this bit of the world... have to do an interview with an extra- person... if i am not careful i might interview the whole city just by curiosity... anyway... this is going to be interesting for my work. he is an architect and has done what I believe to be the first study of compatibilization with the surroundings using new technology and being very careful about criteria and etc... actually i think he developed the criteria as the&nbsp;technicians at the department responsible for it haven´t got a clue. and it is not&nbsp;that they are adopting the ´flexible´approach... no... what happens is that they don´t know what&nbsp;to do...&nbsp;he is a great architect and a good friend as well. interviewing friends is good... it is relaxing... the invitation for the interview is always an invitation for a mate and for a talk about this and that... but mate always comes first. interesting... after lunch i have the workshop with the elderly... and after that relax... today the temperature is much better and i don´t even need the 'estufa' on. I am not so compressed as I was before and the medicine for flue makes me high, relaxed and a bit dizzy...&nbsp;the workshop is going to be&nbsp;intense but&nbsp;funny... I needed someone to help me but couldn´t find anyone...well, didnt look for anyone... it is going to be fine and by&nbsp;4 i believe I am free.

      I knew it would happen... As the time goes by... I get lazier and lazier to write... Life is not a everymomentasurprise anymore and things start to be a routine again. But anyway... an update of my brazilian gap... I have done half of the interviews I needed to do last week and all the three workshops with teenagers in school. There is the other half of the itnerviews and the workshop with the elderly people and the sensory workshop with the architecture students. I am planning to do all the interviews before going to the amazon and there will be only the sensory workshop and the interview in porto alegre for afterwards... let´s see if it goes as I am planning. I had lots of energy last week. This week I am already fed up of interviews and of talking to people... But I have to do this effort and finish this as soon as possible. I have already booked my ticket for the 4th of august coming back on the 23rd. The flight to the amazon takes 5 hours flying and one hour changing planes in Brasília. It will be a crazy trip with my father. I am now studying the ayahuasca!! I will try to find a place where i can try it... lets see if my father will join me ... But I have the idea that trying ayahuasca in the jungle might be an unmissable experience...&nbsp; Meanwhile I am in the cold and humid Pelotas. My body is deteriorating... my joints are hurting because of the yellow fever vaccin but I believe that the true reason is the humidity and my advanced age and 'reumatismo'. Anyway... I need somewhere hot. I need to swim... And I had the weirdest dream ever... I dreamt I had gone to a place to study but at the same time it was a kind of sanatorium and there were lots of other people also... like you all but everyone could go out and i was in jail... and there was a woman that was saying that... that I wasn´t allowed to go out and i woke up crying... can you believe that?!?! We eat so late here that almost everynight i have nightmares... I use to have it a lot and since i went to oxford i never had it anymore... crazy. ´have a meeting at 9 now... i´ll keep on lazyly updating the blog....

      The thing that most amazed me when i arrived in Oxford was the rain... not the rain actually but the fact that no one seemed to care about the rain... while here people would stay at home and dont go to school or to work because of the rain... there everyone would go out and even cycle in the rain... but then i had to go out today... and it was raining... and i thought that now my perception of the rain was different and that it didnt matter for me if it was raining or not... i just had to go and that was it... i would get my umbrella and leave and i did it... i left... and in less than 5 seconds I was completely wet... impressive... the rain in Pelotas is not like any oxford raininha... better stay at home.

      My first workshop was at Ginásio do Areal a state school where the students rents are around 60 pounds a month. I had 16 students because it was at the night shift and the temperature was so low that most of them didn´t go... Some of them didn´t go also because they have to work and it is not always that they can leave work to go to school. A very interesting environment, very interesting people, very low paid teachers but extremely enthusiastic. A very touching scene. People doing a lot for the world in a very small scale... alsmot one to one. I didn´t get exactly what i wanted from the workshop... maybe because the method was not the most appropriate but it was a very interesting experience. In the end they didn´t want me to go because they were fascinated with some of the stories i told them about living abroad. It doesn´t seem something so difficult anymore. And i am sure the english teacher will be surprised in the next class.

      I am already in my second nitght in Porto Alegre. It is a wonderful city. Happy and dangerous. Millions of stimulus all the time. Noise and silence.  This is a song from Kleiton e Kleidir and it express a bit Porto Alegre mood:  Deu prá ti,    baixo astral Vou prá Porto Alegre, tchau Quando eu ando assim, meio down Vou prá Porto e bah, tri legal Coisas de magia, sei lá Paralelo trinta  Alô tchurma do Bonfim As guria tão tri afim Garotada do bar João Beladona e chimarrão  Que saudade da redenção Do Fogaça e do Falcão Cobertor de orelha pro frio E a galera do Beira Rio

      today I woke up with a feeling of impossibiliy. it was 4.30am. Very scaring. Impossibility about everything. Got up. Things get less strong when you are fully awake. I must start my work. It will help in every sense. Keep busy, be productive. Time for a mate.

      Funny. Sundays are sad days. Maybe it is genetic... My grandmother hates sndays as well. Family séstia and footbal. I ate a mortadela and queijo da colônia sandwich and a glass of yogurt. I think I will explode if I don´t stop eating. My whole body and energy is changing. The body is growing and the energy is disminishing. This is bad.

      Wake up, make a mate and wait for the others to wake up and start to discuss the menu. People are invited from the day before and some don´t need invitation at all. It is just there...it is known already. Sunday lunch at hugo´s house (it is a flat but anything that you live in here is called a house). As soon as my father wakes up the music and the kitchen will start. Music is samba as he is fascinated by that. No other music has the same appeal to him than samba. The first round in the kitchen is the breakfast. Usually he has coffee, pure, no milk and no sugar and maybe two or three crackers or toast with butter Damby (traditional from Pelotas and according to all pelotenses with no similar in the world). Verymuch like me. But today, because I am here, guawa juice, and mamão as well. Sunday lunch is barbecue. And barbecue is meat and nothing else. We don´t eat salad or whatever else. Bread maybe but if not...no problem. Ah farinha yes, especially if there is salsichao (pork sausages). We are meat eaters. I thought i wouldn´t want to eat much meat but it is in my blood, in my skin i think... i just can´t resist. Yesterday I had a fantastic barbecue at Cruz the Malta or lunch. They bring the meat in metal trays with bread and farinha and bring as many forks and knifes as the number of people on the table. we place the tray in the middle of the table and share. everyone attacks the same piece of meat cutting small bites until it is finished. yesterday we had rins (pork leaver) filed with fine herbs and bacon and after an entrecot (a special cut from the cow (?)rsrs). Today, because i told them i didn´t want to eat much meat all the time and because my sister is craving for a ´galinha da colônia) which is a huge chicken grown in the country side (we call colônia) eating corn, etc, my father decided to barbecue a chicken but there will also be pork ribs, a pineaple (! very very unusuall but he wants to try a recipe he learnt from someone) and maybe...very likely my cousing that is also coming will bring a huge peice of beef or tiras (cow ribs cut very thin...my favourite by far). It will be an unusual barbecue with all those different things but they are very flexible and sometimes we do like to try different things even though it is a bretrayal to the gaucho tradition. I´ll run now to see if I can keep fit in this food world. Everything is generated or generates food. If you meet you meet to eat something...and of course!! to have a mate, even though a mate means a shot of cachaçca but you are always invited for a mate.

      Two traditional institutions in Pelotas. Saturday morning favourite programme. They deserve more than a feel lines and I will take my time to write about it but for now...i just wat to tell that Café Aquário is a café and lancheria (plac toe at snacks?) where until the 60s or 70s maybe...i have to check no women would there go inside. Until now is a men dominated place and it is magical. It has a wonderful atmosphere. You buy ´fichas´at the counter and exchange it for cafezinhos...cafezinhos are not expressos at all. it is filtered coffee and you have as many as you like during the whole day. The Café is placed in a corner and kind of marks the socil centre of the city. The food there is also very very good. Torrada de presunto e queijo e baurú are the favourites. Everyone goes there and it is a place to discuss from politics to local gossips. A place to visit as soon as you arrive to be updated of what is going on in the city and to meet people. A must. rsrsrs Cruz de Malta is a botequim and he best thing to do there is to eat their barbecue and drink beer but on saturdays moring it si the place to eat Mocotó. The mix of people there is amazing. Botequims are like that. Congregate everyone with no distinctions or prejudices. Pity I can´t place photographs on this blog...

      wonderful morning at the feira. Feira livre is how it is called. a fruit, vegetable and whatever you can imagine open market that happens every saturday morning at Avenida Bento Gonçalves. It is small though. 5 blocks of 100m more or less. the colours, the variety and the smells are great. people also... with troleys, bicycles, walking... Plus horses, cars, motorbikes and many other things together. It is crazy. it is very nice. It is amazing to see it again after two years. It is amazing to look with an outsider eye. Things that were common and part of my life before become different and very interesting again. bought mandarines, mint, basil and pinhão. Hundreds of pics... interesting to show other people from here my perception of the feira... it is completely different. they might not find interesting what i found...

      friday was a weird day. i was very very tired. i arrived with energy enough to get excited about things but friday i was feeling like shit. stayed connected to Oxford the whole morning trying to escape virtually but couldn´t. Then i had a 4 hours siesta and at night smoked around 10 joints before eating three amazing dishes of feijão, arroz e bife!!! After that, of course, my energies are even lower.

      The city is still very ugly but much more lively and with a very nice atmosphere than I expected. We arrived at night and went straight to my father´s place so I couldn´t see much. I was extremelly tired but managed to phone Márcia to come and have dinner with us (prawns from the Lagoon - Laranjal - with rice for main and for starter soup of fish´s heads. Just perfect!!). She came at 8, we had dinner and after dinner I was so completely cream crackered that i fell asleep when they were still there. ´They´ are guto, my father and Márcia. They left and in a act of desperation I went to bed without having a shower. Of course the next mornign my whole body was itchying...my neck, my belly, everything. swet and dirtyness=itchy! Wonderful shower at my father´s flat. The pressure of the water and the size of the shower are amazing!! He has also a sauna and a bath but I still didnt manage to find time for it. Pity. Thursday morning I visited the great news in the city ´The Big´ which is a huge supermarket in the middle of the city. Sunday programme for everyone. Cidade pequena!!! In the afternoon I managed to visit the university where I use to work. strange feeling. It was like if I had never left but at the same time if I had never worked there. I also felt a bit jealous to see some of the programmes and activivite I had started being developed by other people with no reference to me. But that is the way it should be anyway. Life continues and no one is insubstituivel. Went home, ate the most delicious tongue with peas in my life and fell asleep again. Thanks to the persianas I am sleeping around 9 hours. Persianas are a kind of fixed curtains that when closed make the room completely dark. Just the invention of the century.

      Just waking up from a 4 hours siesta in my old sofa. I use to sleep there everyday before leaving. The heat is crazy and the humidity even worst. My skin is sticky. I need to eat something sweet and have a shower. The light is fantastic though. Pelotas has one of the most beautiful skys I have ever seen. Everything is yellowish and the sun is almost about to set down. I´ll get prepared for a great night with Ester, Rogerio and Miguel. Pity i cant post photos in this blog. Tchau, vou pro banho...

      Good. No one was there waiting me!! because of course I couldnt´tell anyone of the happened. But they were at the airport so I phoned and met them eventually. I must be very insensitive I don´t know but didnt feel anything especial. Am i weird or it is always like that? I always said I wasn´t a very missing person but don´t feel any type of excitment is crazy. What I think is that I am very good in substituting and updating my emmotional connections. We went to my sister´s house. Very much like guto´s style. packed with memories. I wonder how would a house of myself be? I had never have one. Even when i lived one year alone, it was a very different situation and I didn´t have much with me anyway... was a kind of adaptation perios. Do I always end up living other people´s lives? We had frango a passarinho take away and i was a bit impatient to go home. had a bit of siesta and we left. Guto wwas driving our car. On the way I saw thew first thing that caused a sort of reaction. A ´carroça´ on the highway. That was great. i love ´carroças´. i am sure I saw other things on the way that called my attention but I cant remember anymore... I will eventually and then I´ll write. I´ll stop here for today. Will write my impressions about Pelotas later one.

      Then I flew to Paris and was waiting there forever...got the plane to sao paulo and came with two paraguayans on my side. I must say that I felt a bit apatic about everything, about Oxford and about Brazil while I was waiting the plane in Paris. The only thing that made me feel something was meeting brazilians. I felt disgusted, embarassed by them and i dont really know how to explain what else i felt but they were not good feelings. I must think and try to understadn what makes me feel so umconfortable about brazilians. I don´t really understand that I just know that is very weird to see them(!) in an outside environment. By the time I got the plane i was wearing my very tight boots and of course, I took them off as soon as i got into the plane. The food was good, had some wine and despite all the advices from daniel, couldn´t face the tomato juice. Tomatoes are for food in my perception and i just couldnt do it but...on my way back...i will. I hate not trying things just because of prejudice. What would be of all the cow´s tongues if no one would ever try them because of prejudice?! A waste. So I´ll have some tomato juice on the wy back. The plane landed and there was no way i could put my boots on...So...after 1year and 9 months away from Brazil I arrive wearing my very colourful gloves like socks, shining the guarulhos floor. Luckly or not I met my suitcase that was suposed to meet me only in POA but the flight to POA was cancelled and there was no prevision. Varig´s idea was to give the money back and let us book another flight for another day!!! By then I should be desperate but i wasn´t. i was very calm and when they offered some places in another company´s flight leaving in 20 min I took it. The only problem is that the luggage wouldn´t come with us but sometime later in the day or the day after. Who cares about luggage??? I just want to arrive! Runned like I don´t know what to get the other plane when I got there it was already closed!!! Cryed for the man to let me and some other people to get in. He didn´t resist my cry and allowed us. The flight stopped at Campinas before and they wanted us to elave there and wait for another plane to porto Alegre but in the end after we said we wouldnt they allowed us to stay again and I finally went to POA.

      A chaos i must say. the first problem at heathwrow. the bacl and white french check in person didnt allow me to bring 2kg of excess in my suit case and there was not that i could say to change her mind. Even me offering to pay the excess was not a possibility because it was a special case...now imagine...if it WAS special because the company had cancelled my flight they should facilitate it and not create more problems. but then...that is how black and white people and situations are...irrational or too rational. Yes, I forgot to say before that my flight that should be leaving at 7.15 to paris was cancelled and the alternative was to put me in one that would get there after my connection to brazil had left!!!! very clever of them! or i culd take the 6pm one which was just 40 minutes from leaving... So i stayed there on the waiting list for the 6pm flight and I managed to leave only 900grams of excess which for the B&W person was ok. Now,,, teLL me... what is the difference between 2kg and 900grams?!?! Anyway, I left my babouches in the suitcase and took my boots and some papers out... that was the way I could make her happy.

      The three days in the floresta Amazônica were wonderful. We slept in hammocks in a flutuante (flotant) with Lorenzo, Gianni and Roberto from Florence, Chantal and Rosane from france and Juan and Maria Jose from Spain. Fished piranhas, swam in the river Araçá, camped in the jungle sleeping in hammocks and did some walking tours to learn about natural medicines., perfumes and watch monkeys, birds, jacarés, bicho preguiça and many other animals i dont even remember the names... Ate fish all the time... A really unmissable experience... Back in Manaus now and preparing to leave to belém on wednesday afternoon in a very nice boat... not too big, not too small.. We go on camarotes but most people travel in hammocks... I´ll write re when i get in belém on sunday... if everything goes alright as the captain explained us!!! I wonder what an happen along the amazon that could delay us... Today rained as if we were swimming in a river... never saw such a strong rain... inté.
