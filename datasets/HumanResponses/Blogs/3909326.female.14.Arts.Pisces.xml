       Tommarow is not!  Tommarow is the day  Lauren  turns 14! and joins the cult of all us other people who have taken the plunge into  fourteen-ism ! Congradulations  Lauren !... I mean I'm super sorry I won't be here for you  fab-tacular  day but you know... Camping calls! Tommarrow is also the day I finish swimming and the day that I'm stuck in the car with my two younger,  pesky brothers for like 5 HOURS!!!   some how that just doesn't seem fair!  Signing off lots of love (and birthday wishes)

      Hey, So ya just chilling in this funk-a-delic vertual world. Surfin it up!... Hey check out these cool "spells" to send you positive energie!: (sounds kinda cool huh)    Irresista-spell    Best performed on a full moon at midnight. 1 small seashell * pink cloth * a hair from your head * orange ribbon  Place the shell and the hair in the cloth. Close your eyes and imagine yourself surrounded by golden light. Tie up the cloth with the ribbon. Keep the pouch on you at all times and you will charm everyone you meet.   Admiration spell   A nail clipping or hair from the person you admire * a red wax candle * black thread * a nail * white cloth  Melt candle wax . Let it stand until it begins to solidify, then mould into a ball before casting a circle. Press the nail clipping or hair into the wax, then shape it into the person's form. Tie one end of the thread around the effigy's waist and the other around the nail. Twist the nail in a clockwise direction so that the thread winds around it, saying: "Come (person's name), come to me. You don't know why but can't deny your need to come to me. My thoughts are pure and free from sin but with this thread I draw you in. Feel the pull of destiny. Come (person's name), come now to me."  Wrap the nail and wax model in white cloth and store them somewhere safe, so that there is no chance of anybody tampering with this powerful spell.    Unprepared lesson chant   God and Goddess hear my need and understand why I must plead for magic shafts of astral light to hide me from this teacher's sight. I haven't done the work, you see so please don't let them pick on me guide them to a mind so bright they'll surely find the answers right."   Anti-hex spell   A small apple twig * a hair from your head  Wrap the hair around the twig, saying: "Whoever it is that vexes me, could vex themselves by the power of three. As I wish them no harm, I'll bind their power to the safety of a neutral tree."  Place the twig and hair in the branches of a nearby tree.
