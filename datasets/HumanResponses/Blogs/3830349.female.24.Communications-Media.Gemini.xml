         I hear this is just the beginning of the hot summer days to come in Israel. It's not the kind of Jersey hot I'm used, where the humidity wears you down. It's just hot enough to walk half a block and break a big sweat. I try to tell myself it does have its advantages. My boyfriend is very impressed when I come in from a "run" dowsed in sweat. No need to tell him it's just a brisk walk down the street.     And in my Ulpan there's another oh so unpleasant sign of summer in Israel...     My Ulpan is full of Russian women and men (very big Russian men)who are used to below zero temperatures. They've been thrown from Siberia into the heart of the Middle East, where temperatures easily soar into the 90's and higher. So, they often arrive to class, soaked with sweat and smelly. Smelling terribly. Thankfully, our class usually moves to an air conditioned room, where everyone quickly cools off. But I'm dreading the day when I'll come to class at the summer's peak and we'll have to stay in a sun-drenched and stuffy room for my five hour Hebrew class.

      Not so long ago, when I first arrived here I was bombarded with so many cultural differences that all I could stand to do was criticize them. Everything from what I call the typical Israeli attitude, to the food compromising mostly of bread, cheese, and falafel, was fair game. And I bitched, and bitched, to anyone who would listen here and back home in the states. I especially complained about my daily Hebrew class (Ulpan) that was entirely made up of immigrants from Russia. I hated the fact that they were able to communicate with one another and that I was sorrounded by a mixture of Hebrew and a flurry of Russian...unable to understand anything in either language.  But not until today, did I realize that my class is something much more than a language class, and the method of throwing a mix of people from everywhere into these Ulpanim, proves that in its own, dysfunctional way, Israel is working.  As the only American in the class, I'm amazed to be sorrounded by people who've had to hide their identity as Jews in the face of Communism. And I'm even more amazed by the number that hide their identity here. Many of the Russians that are here, have distant relatives that are Jews, which is enough for them to gain entrance into the country and to become citizens. But they have little connection to the religion and many of them confess they're determination to maintain the religion they were raised with: Christianity.  They've seen things I could only imagine, and likewise.  But whether I or the people in the class want to admit it, we're bonding...as semi- immigrants in new country. Yesterday we talked about Sharon's new pullout plan, to dismantle some of the settlements in the Gaza Strip. The discussion alone, in our limited Hebrew, was unifying for us. Everday, its meaning less and less that I'm an American and that they're Russian, or Uzbek or Romanian. We're slowly becoming Israelis, whether we want to or not, whether we are citizens or not, and whether we're Jewish or not. Our differences are fading, and we're integrating slowly into Israeli society, and where we're from is becoming less important as where we're headed.
