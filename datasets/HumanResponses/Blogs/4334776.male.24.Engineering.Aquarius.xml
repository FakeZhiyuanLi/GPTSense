      Where is my damned wallet?  I couldn't find my stupid keys today.  I woke up from a beautiful nap with plenty of time to walk to class but my keys decided to hole up in a bag of unpacked luggage.  The stupid thing is as the minutes ticked down and finally reached 3:30 (class time) I honestly thought about just skipping the whole thing to avoid being "late."  I hate being known as the late guy  ....well...I hate it as much as someone who is to lazy to hate can hate.  I'm a Grad student and I still have this mental compulsion that was blasted into my brain by psycho-nazi-professors who think its a personal afront that I wouldn't show up to there class on time everyday.  This is  a stupid problem to have.....oh...there's my wallet.  Taco Bell here I come.  Woohoo!

      I’m pissed off at this movie and at M. Night Shyamalan because I can’t just outright say this movie sucked.  It was a good movie, but his movies always feel like their missing something important and don’t really satisfy me.  I think it’s because he pretty much follows exactly the same formula for all his movies.  They always consist of three parts.   The first part is the “cool idea” that forms the basis of his story.  I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who hasn’t seen it.  In his other movies they are…kid who can talk with dead people, dude that can’t be hurt found by dude that’s super venerable to injury, crop circles and aliens, etc.  The second is the surprise scene.  He always throws a scene in there where some beastie human or otherwise pops out at you.  Finally the third and final part of the formula is the reveal of the twist at the very end of the movie.  Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, Mr. Glass caused the accidents to find Mr. Unbreakable again Bruce Willis, God working through the whole movie so that Joaquin Phoenix could kick alien ass, and finally ….  well you have to pay your good money to see the twist in the Village.  So like I was saying it was some how unsatisfying.  I pretty much new something was coming, I didn’t know what but the knowledge of the formula kind of ruined it for me….and now for you possibly J.  What pisses me off though is that I feel like if I said it’d sucked because of this it’d be like I was saying 2001:  A Space Odyssey sucked because it was slow and boring, or that A Clockwork Orange sucked because it didn’t make any damn sense.  The supposedly “deep” people who “get” movies would say I’m just not looking at the message or the overall picture, but there are plenty of movies out there that are cool and even through in some good messages or thoughts without sucking or being overly complicated.

      Was there any doubt?  Yes some….but nonetheless this movie was awesome.  Don’t want to spoil anything but lets just say the main predator in this movie is so much more of a badass than the predators from the first two movies, pansies in comparison.   A friend of mine saw it before me and told me it wasn’t what he expected, but I got the vibe that it sucked.  So I went in expecting it to suck a little…but since it doesn’t take much for me to like a movie I figured it’d be at least worth watching once by my scale.  Turns out it was really good.  Going in not expecting to much probably helped me to enjoy it even more.  There’s few movies that get me tweaked up, nervous, and enthralled enough that my chest and abdomen muscles start contracting.  AVP had me on the proverbial edge of my seat.
