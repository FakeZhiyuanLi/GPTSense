      After a very short discussion, Mark and I decided not to try the flea market again. We'll have as many yardsales as we can between now and the last few weeks we're in our house. Then we'll call in an auctioneer to finish off the furniture and anything else we haven't sold.    This past week we had another huge yardsale. And in true Ohio fashion we managed to get rained on two of the three days of the sale!  But we did manage to sell off a huge amount of the smaller stuff we've accummulated, plus most of the things donated to the sale by friends and family.  I'll be graduating from the apprenticeship on June 19th...Yay!! Ater 4 years, I'll be a full-fledged journeyman heavy equipment operator. We've decided to move out of our rental house by the end of July if at all possible.  We'll use the rest of the time after that to finish our sales and to do some remaining wood trim in the RV. Plus, Mark wants to build wooden boxes to store his RC plane and the telescope.  Since we still haven't had any calls from the Union on jobs, we figure it's best to move out of the house and into a campground as soon as possible so we can stop spending our savings for rent and utilities. We can live for hundreds of dollars cheaper in an RV park. If the Union doesn't come through with some jobs soon, we'll probably take other jobs for the remainder of this summer and fall to augment our travel money and avoid spending our savings.  And then we'll be off on the road following Plan B, which is that we'll have to do some workcamping or find other places to work for few months to finance our travel plans. Either way, we're ready to get out of Ohio...and the rain...and the lack of work. We talked to a man the other day who lives in Las Vegas and he told us that Union heavy equipment operators have no trouble getting work in Vegas. Since it's someplace we've both wanted to visit, and we're heading Southwest anyway, we may just mosey on out there and see what we can see.  We are still excited about our plans to give up our stick-n-brick existence for a fulltime RV'ing lifestyle. We are a little bit bummed that after three years of planning, the bottom seems to have fallen out of the job market, but that would happen no matter what kind of house we lived in. At least with a motorhome, we can travel to places where there is more work and stay in the comfort of our own home at the same time!

      It looks as though some of our friends and family are getting into the spirit of our travel preparations.  Knowing that we're planning to have as many sales as we can before we leave, some of our friends and family have started going through their basements, attics and garages and contributing items for our sale!  How cool is that??  In the beginning I was worried that many of our friends and family didn't understand what we were planning to do.  I think some of the older ones think we're having 60's flashbacks and are wanting to "tune in and drop out" (isn't that what they called it in the 60's?)! I know quite a few people worried how we'd live and if we'd be ok.  And of course, some people simply didn't want us to go away from them, which is so sweet.    But we feel we're doing something we really want to do at a time in our life when it feels right to be doing it. With our plans to come back to Ohio each summer and fall to work our construction jobs, we'll still have time to visit our friends, so it's not a complete abandonment!! We'll be back to visit!  And this way will actually give us more chance to visit all our family.  Mark's family is in Ohio and mine are in Tennessee so we can spend time seeing both families. Maybe even drive up to Boston and visit my cousins there, and stop in to meet some of the wonderful friends we've made over the internet. Won't they all be surprised! *g*

      Today Mark and I spent some time cleaning up some of our belongings which we plan to sell.  We've been having a few yard sales when the weather is nice, and last week we even tried setting up a booth at the flea market...that was tough!  I'll never view them the same again; that's a lot of work! We haven't decided if we'll try the market again or stick to the yard sales.  I think when it's closer to our departure date, we'll call in an auctioneer to get rid of any of the things that are left and to sell our furniture so we don't have to worry with it.  We still have to buy the wood to make the remainder of the trim for the motorhome; I suppose we'll do that soon. We'd better...it shouldn't be much longer before we get called for jobs and then we won't have time to do much of anything until the work season is over!

      My s/o, Mark, and I are planning a major life change this year. We are selling most of our belongings and moving into a 25' motorhome full time! I wanted to have this blog as a way to document the processes we go as well as to follow our adventures after moving out of our stick-n-brick home.  Mark and I both work in the heavy equipment operating field as members of Union Local 18 here in Southern Ohio. We generally don't work during the cold, wet winter and spring months. A few years ago it occured to us that if we owned an RV we would be able to pack up and leave this place after the work season ended and not return until late spring every year.   At first, we didn't think beyond living in the RV temporarily as we traveled; much like retired people who are referred to as "snowbirds". Then it occured to us that we could actually move into the RV fulltime; give up the house and all the "stuff" and live in a local campground here when we returned to work during the summer and fall.  And who knows? We might find someplace during our travels that we like just as well and won't want to return here every year.  As the song says, "The future is wide open"!  We have begun the process of selling off some of our belongings; mostly things from the attic and books, old jewelry, things we will no longer need during the remaining few months of being "house-bound".  The remodel on the RV is nearly complete. We still need to install some new wood trim around the doors and a few of the cabinets. And we want to install a larger fridge and a new awning. But some of those bigger items will have to wait until we are back at work and bringing in the weekly checks again. Work is slow going back this year, and that is starting to bother us...we hadn't figured on less than a full work season and may have to re-evaluate our plan if we dont' get calls from the Union soon.  We could be workcamping somewhere instead of sitting here spending our savings while we wait on a phone call!

      Just wanted to post an update for any of my friends or family who may be checking the blog. We are having our internet cut off here at the house on the 30th of June...2 days from now!! Yikes!! It will be my first time without the internet in the house in nearly 8 years!! I may feel 'nekid'!! *lol*  As soon as we get set up at the campground we'll be having a phone line installed since we'll be in one place for several months. I won't have my fast cable connection, but at least I will have a phone modem so I can stay in touch and update my blog.  On to happier news...I've found a home for my two house cats!! Yippee!! I was beginning to panic and be seriously depressed about this as I've been turned down by just about every no-kill shelter in Ohio! One of my friends, Laura, who lives in Michigan said she would take them if I could get them to her! It's about a a 6-hour drive one way, but if it means finding them a good and loving home, then I have no problem with delivering them! I am ecstatic!!  Mark and I have been working diligently on the wood trim in the motorhome. All that is left is the entry door and some decorative trim in the cab section. We should be able to knock that out with one more day of good hard labor.  We've also made some inroads into the chaos that is our woodshop. That's going to take more work than either of us imagined, but it's the last biggest job we have left.  Now we just have to figure out HOW to get the things we are taking packed into the storage boxes in the most efficient way and have them ready to store when we get the cap put on the pickup. Some days it seems we feel we have to take all kinds of things and the next day we feel we barely need more than a toothbrush! Condensing two lives into a space as small as our motorhome and truck bed (with an eye to weight considerations) is a challenge!  I love a challenge!

      Only a few weeks left until the auction! July 21st is the revised date for our household auction. Some days I think it can't get here soon enough and other days I'm worried sick that we can never be ready by then!   But we will be ready! Or we'll deal with it as best we can...July 21st it will be! We have the remaining pieces of wood trim cut out; as well as a new laptop table we decided at the last minute to add to the Navigator (Passenger) Seat side of the Cab. We still have to cut out and build the box which will hold our CB and radio as well as our office supplies. But that's the jobs left that we need the woodworking shop to complete. We think we can get them all done this coming week, which will leave the remaining time for clearing junk out of the shop and cleaning up the tools and machinery for the sale.  We have already picked out and paid a deposit on the campsite where we will move when we leave here. Before Mark got called to go back to work, we were planning to try to leave Ohio by the end of August and start our travels early with a trip to Tennessee to visit my family. This plan called for several month-long stops rather than going wherever the spirit took us, but it was necessary because we were planning on traveling on severely limited funds.  Now that Mark is back at work (and hopefully I will be soon), we can stick with our original plan. We will stay in a local campground as long as the work lasts, which should be late autumn. Then we will be able to travel at least until the following May and our resources won't be so seriously limited.   Meanwhile, all we have to do is try to keep our noses to the grindstone in preparing for this sale! This shouldn't be so hard as we are both "chomping at the bit" to get out of here and into our new lifestyle.

      We've had a wonderful turn of good fortune at a time when we needed it most desperately!  Today Mark received a call from the company he worked with last year and they are starting up a new job on Monday. He'll be operating a loader for them and the job should last until it is too cold to dig and lay pipe! Yes!! Yippee!!    For over three years Mark and I have planned on the day we would sell our extraneous belongings and move into the motorhome fulltime. Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would both have medical setbacks at the same time which would require us to be off work for several months...and then for bad weather and a poor job market to leave us unemployed for a couple months beyond our normal winter "down time".   But this is exactly what happened to us! We both made it nearly to the end of last year's work season, but Mark was so sick with lung problems (for a while there we were both very worried about his condition!), and I ended up having a complete hysterectomy.  We are both much better now, but for a while there it was looking pretty bleak.   But one day has made the difference. We've reached a turn-around point. Mark is going back to work, and I should be getting a call from the Union any day now to go back to work myself. Hopefully, we will both be able to work until early winter and earn enough to replace our lost savings, and buy a few "goodies" we wanted for the motorhome and our travels.    We have already starting planning to have an auction rather than dragging on with yard sales....yard sales will wear you out in a hurry!! So, on July 20th, we will have an auction here and no matter what the outcome financially, we will be well and truly done with all these belongings that just feel like boat anchors to us now. All the proceeds from the auction will go toward replacing our savings.    And less than two weeks after the auction we will be moving the motorhome to a campground as convenient to our jobs as possible. So, all told...we have just 5 weeks until we are free of the house and all the work we've had to do leading up to becoming fulltimers. It's hard to believe that after all the planning, working and waiting we are about to embark on what promises to be a big adventure!

      Whew!!  Getting rid of 4 closets and two dressers full of clothes turned out to be a bigger chore than I thought!! After two days....and a dozen lawn-sized garbage bags...we've done it!  We now own 45 pounds of clothing for each of us, not counting coats and work boots, which will be put into Space Bags and stored in the "toad".  It is very liberating to realize we've taken this big step toward getting free of our belongings.  Realizing I'd become a person who felt attached to a closet full of dress clothes was disturbing and I feel much better having them out of my life!  If I'm going to be attached to anything, I sure as hell hope it ain't silk shirts and high heels! That is not the life I envisioned for myself when I was growing up!  I WILL be an intrepid adventurer...damn it!!   At the rate we are moving along, we will be living out of the motorhome while parked at the side of the house long before the July 17th auction!  Mark and I are both so excited, we just want to get it all done and be on our way! Even with the stress of all the things we have to get done with the upcoming move into the motorhome, Mark and I are feeling a bit like conspirators with a big secret! We are both excited at this new phase in our lives...our first big move together as a couple. And it's shaping up to be an excellent adventure!

      What a crazy time this is for us! We have an appointment for an Auctioneer to come to the house on Monday morning to look at our stuff. I'm not sure why exactly...perhaps to give us some idea of how much money we can hope to make off the remainder of our belongings...perhaps to tell us all the rest of our stuff is crap and we don't stand a snowball's chance in Hades of making money on it! *g*  Anyway, we have been trying to sort our belongings into piles based on whether they're items to be sold, stored at Mark's parent's house, or carried out to the motorhome and put away. Already I can see that we are going to have to really keep an eye on the weight we are wanting to carry.  We plan to be out of here by the end of July, but we plan to have all our extraneous belongings sold on the action date, which has been set for July 17th.  Only 35 days left until the action and 51 until we are completely out of the house and into a local campground for a while so we can catch our breath and regroup.  I am so excited I can barely sleep. Our house is a mess of boxes and piles of "things" everywhere!  I really hope things go well for us; we could use a run of good luck!

      Guess what? The cable company has stood me up!! Yep...hard to imagine, but true! I scheduled the cut off for the 30th of June. I removed the computer modem so they could pick it up and no one showed up! I called again, and they seemed pretty lacksadaisical about it, but said they WOULD be out. After a few days, of guilty pleasure watching cable I shouldn't have, I said "What the hell, I'm putting the modem back on, too!" *g*  So, they could pull the plug at any moment...I'm sure they will after they realize they have my pro-rated check for cable service up to the end of June!   Today Mark and I drove to Michigan to meet Laura and her daughter Kelly. Laura is a good friend that I met online and her daughter, Kelly, is the wonderful young lady who offered to adopt my two cats.  While, I am sad to have to find homes for my cats after having them for 8 years, it was something that had to be done. After the troubles Mark has developed with his lungs, we were told my the lung specialist that they HAD to go or we'd risk further damage to Mark's lungs. Fortunately, Laura and Kelly rescued them...and me...in our hour of need. If I can influence anyone reading this...please...if you have room in your home and in your heart...adopt a mature cat or dog. They have much less chance of finding homes, and they deserve an opportunity to live in a home and to give and receive love and companionship.  As for the moving...we are moving right along! *g*  We are about half finished with our final woodworking project and should be done with it by the end of this week. That will give us nearly two weeks to finish cleaning and packing up the shop. The house is all but finished, as we have only the dishes we use daily left in the cupboards, a few towels, and our clothes, which will be transferred to the RV within the next week.   Then, it's just a matter of waiting til the auction date of the 21st, making sure people removed all the items they paid for...and getting the hell out of town!    I'll post more as time...and the cable company...allows.
