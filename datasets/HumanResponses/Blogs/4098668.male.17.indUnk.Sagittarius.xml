      so ive decided to make an online journal, mostly out of bordom. theres nothing better for me to do like, read the english assignments for the summer or do the questions. now i know what your asking yourself right this second, "Andrew, what would you write about in the first entry of an online journal? and has this milk gone sour?" answering in order of importance: yes, the milk is infact sour. you should probebly put it down and not drink it. secondly, 'the village' 'the village' i speak of is the movie that just came to theaters yesterday. and what a movie it is. the same psyco that brought you 'the sixth sense' is back yet again to deviler a somewhat understandable plot line along with crazy twists and turns. and when i say the plot line is 'somewhat understandable' i mean it is 'most likely uncomprehensible to even Stephen Hawking.' now if you have plans on going to see this 'g-pav' style movie anytime soon, i will give you 2 pieces of advice: 1) dont read-on cause im going to reveal the suprise of the movie, and 2) dont waste you time/money to go see it so heres how the story goes. basicly theres a town thats out in the middle of nowhere suposedly in the 1900's or something. the setting got on my nerves the whole time, i wish i had a knife with me so that i could slit my wristes just to see a color other than yellow. the village inhabited by a bunch of colonial-day-actor-rejects that tryed to get an job in Philidelphia but since they apparently stayed in character (complete with crappy accent) even after they were done working, the sane citizens of the city banished them from civilization forever. that might not be exactly what happened, but its what came to mind while watching the movie. anyhow, theres this blind chick that uses a shepards staff for a 'seeing-stick' or whatever its called. but heres a twist most people wont see (haha, see, get it?) she only uses the cane the exact instant she comes to a step or, in one case, a 50 ft deep pit found in the middle of the woods. thats right, there are scenes of her frolicing about in a meadow, racing a guy while she navigates the hills and valleys perfectly without the aid of sight. but is she truly blind? she claims to be able to see one mans 'color' (and if thats not a racist subliminal message i dont know what isnt). but she refuses to speak of his 'color', which i have come to belive was probebly something around a light purple, ya know, something that if he knew his color he would feel like a friggin panzy. now your here reading this review of the movie and you probebly wondering "what about the creatures in the woods? the previews talk of monsters." and this is true, they have creatures in the previews, but it turns out in the movie that (heres a tiwst) the monsters are not real, they are only people dressed up in a halloween comstume. and this comes as no suprise when you see what they are. they look like a giant porqupine with bananas for fingers attempting to wear a red jacket. and now you know mostly all of what the movie is about. except for the ending twist which will basicly make you want to vomit your popcorn all over the movie screen just of complete anger at the lack of creativity involved. and be on the look out for the last subliminal message: that guy from the show 'walker, texas ranger' made his own wildlife preserve. dont ask, youll get it when you see the movie. well, i do belive i have ranted enough about this summers best comedy. have a nice day. i leave you now with these words of wisdom "it only requires 200 band-aids to heal someone who has been stabbed in the stomach once and chest twice"

      for the love of God... another emu got out again. it just never ends. i cant explain it, all summer theyve been fine, but now that school is on its way they seem to escape more. anyhow i came home yesterday and my dad and sister were away at a horse thing. when they got back they told me that they saw one of the emus walking around the front yard but didnt try to catch it or anything cause i guess they were late. well it was 10 at night and i decided that theres no way im going to catch the bird this late cause its dark (its tough enough finding them in the daytime). so i woke up this morning and expected some phone calls from the neighbors cause they always alert us when they see one of the emus walking around. but no one called. it got to be around 9:30 am and i started getting worried cause i though the emu would be miles away considering it was gone for most of the day yesterday and all night (they're a nomadic bird, they arent territorial. once they start walking in a direction, they dont stop unless they see food). so i figured that im never going to see the bird again, and that made me mad cause it was Pecker, the most friendly and perhaps the most simple minded of three. so if you would like to rephrase that last sentance, yes it might say "i thought i would never see my Pecker again". moving right along, i was standing in the kitchen and i just so happened to look out the window and there, standing outside the barn, was the emu. i couldnt believe it, he stayed around. i was completly shocked cause: A) theyve NEVER done that before. usually theyre in the neighbors yard within 5 minutes of getting loose. B) i didnt this he'd be dumb enough to stay on the farm. so i cant really explain why he stayed here, i just know that he did for some odd reason. so then i walked out side towards the barn so that i could get some cracked corn to lure him back to the pen, but i could have probebly gone without it: he came right up to me. did i mention how friendly and simple minded he is? well i thought that would be too easy so i got some of the corn and tryed to get him to follow me into the smaller barn. if i got him into that barn, then he could exit out the other end which leads into the pen. but he didnt follow me all the way into the door so i figured i would have to catch him to get him back. i put out some corn and he bagan to eat it and i came right up behind him and just stood there. he kept on eating. didnt run, didnt look up, nothing. so then i grabbed his wings. he looked up and back at me and stood there. didnt run, didnt buck, nothing. now this means he is either VERY friendly, or VERY stupid, im still trying to figure it out. then i walked him through the barn and he went right back into the pen. that was the easiest (and least exciting) emu catch that ever happened. after he was in the pen i went around the front and stood at the fense. he just stood there and looked at me with a "geez, i woulda stuck around, whats your problem?" face. strange strange bird. so i leave you now with these words of wisdom "Whats you favorite planet? mines the sun, i like it cause its like the king of all planets. ya know when that thing burns out we're all gonna be dead"

      Yes, very good, the correct answer is ohio. i awoke at 5:00 AM (yes AM) this morning cause i had to go with my dad to pick up some materials for the  urlLink Snorkeeze  (click it if you dont know what it is yet) in Toledo, Ohio. ya, that city that is at the top of ohio or somewhere around there. at least on the way there i got to see where the band bus got mixed up last year. there were 2 huge signs, really really big signs, monstrous signs, one said "Harrisburg" and the other said "Youngstown". i swear that the bus driver must have been blind, but we dont have to deal with them anymore since EF got a wonderful new bus deal thing. anyhow, we left the house somewhere around 5:45 and arrived at the chemical place around 11:30. if this trip was his idea of 'father son bonding', he failed miserably. i slept most of the way. so we finally got to the place and we picked up the stuff we needed and began our trip back. i drove on the way back that way it appeared as though i was needed. for most of the time then i got to listen to my dad snore, which was just lovely. he did wake up everytime one of the buckets of chemicals in the back fell over. most people would think "uhhh, bucket of chemical...falling over.... BAD" and thats how my dad made it out to be. but the truth is that those buckets are sealed so tightly that its almost impossible to open them up unless you have 5 people helping you and 7 crowbars (thats crowBARS, not crows as in EH EH EH or CAW CAW CAW crows). moving right along, we got to pittsburgh and then my dad was thinkin it was a big deal to drive through the city. so we were in one lane and then a car came up and managed to pull in ahead of me. ooo, wow, how horrible. but my dad wanted to make a big fuss about that too. he was like "I cant believe you just let that car cut infront of you like that!!!!exclamationpoint". so i told him it was just one car, one. i doubt that one car would affect us getting home an hour early/late. but we finally made it home, amazingly, in one piece. so everything is all ready for Snorkeeze production to start, we make the molds this weekend and by next week we have 5 new boats running. well thats what my dad thinks atleast. he thought that we would have been done by november... last november, thats right november 2003. (i think he was a little off). but its all good. band mini-camp starts monday which im excited about cause that means time away from the house. but i dont mind band really, everyone hates it but i dont think its really all that bad. dare i say it, i think im looking forward to going to practice now. :-) aww ya! (sleep-depervation? ill let you decide) well, i leave you now with these words of wisdom "has anyone realized that the olympics are starting on Friday the 13th?"

      "Andrew, Andrew, wake up, the emus loose!" that is probebly the worst phrase i can ever wake up to. so apparently the idea of keeping Bigbird in with the other emus wasnt such a very good idea. we got a call from someone saying that they saw it walking down Pangburn. so me and my dad got into the truck and drove just a little bit and sure enough we found it walking around in someones driveway. we brought some corn with us, but she obviously hadnt forgot about yesterday and made sure she kept her distance. so our new plan was that i would walk her around towards the woods in this one persons backyard. if we could get her through the woods, she would end up on our farm out the other side. my dad then took the truck home and would wait on the other side for me with the emu. everything was going fine, she kept walking about 5 feet infront of me as we headed towards the woods. then she stopped and i kept moving closer real slowly. i thought if i could catch her, i would be able to easily walk her through the feild that lead to our property. so i made a jump for her and i managed to get ahold of both wings this time. but Bigbird isnt as dumb as i thought she was, she learned from yesterday that if she fell backwards, i wouldnt be able to hold onto her. so she did her little falling act and landed on her back with her legs in that air. by that point i decided iwasnt going to get another emu punch so i let go, yet she still scraped up my one arm a bit. she got up quickly and ran off in the opposite direction i was trying to get her to go. she started walking along this other tree line when she came to a little indentation in the woods. after a little looking around, she bolted into the woods. at that point, i knew i couldnt follow her that way. unfortunatly, the woods she ran into were not the ones that lead to our farm, they went toward the road. i made the decision that we would have to wait until she was spotted out of the woods until we could get her. so i came home and took a shower cause Bigbird was all wet when i tryed to grab her and then i was covered in mud. i had thought that atleast half the day's adventure was over. but i was wrong. stay tuned for part 2 of the adventure tomarrow. (im tired and dont feel like typing the rest of it right now). so until tomarrow, have a nice day and keep you pets within eyesight. i leave you now with these words of wisdom "What is that thing? Is it an ostrich? O, an emu, i thought so"

      wow, its been way too long since ive made this post. o well, this is to the best of my memory... well, i was sitting here on the computer for about 15 mins after i had gotten a shower, and i see this car rolling up the driveway. thats basicly my signal that Bigbird had been found. sure enough, the people in the car had seen her walking down the road. they said that she was holding up traffic, which is no suprise cause people defently stop when they see 6 ft tall birds walking around. the people who spotted her were nice enough to give me a ride down the road to where Bigbird was. so we drove down the road and i got out of the car. then it was me and bigbird staring each other down. i was able to walk around behind her so that she would start heading up the road towards my house. this plan actually worked. we got pretty far and then a cop showed up. i though 'well this is just great'. he tryed helping me, i think, and drove his car behind bigbird and it got her going quite bit. but then he started speeding up the car and pulled out ahead of me. what an idiot. he had no idea what he was doing and i just wanted to yell at him. but i didnt want to get on his bad side so i basically tryed to ignor him for the rest of the day. we made it around the bend and then bigbird decides shes going to start walking around in people's yards. ya, good choice. anyhow i was chasing her around a group of trees for most of the time. during this time though the cop drove his car PAST me and the emu and turned it around. and anytime that i managed to get her to move closer toward my house, the cop car would be there right infront of her. stupid cop. and to make matters worse, anytime she stepped near the car, the cop would turn on his siren to spook her. he had to have been the least help there ever was. if i didnt know better, id swear the other emus hired him to help bigbird towards freedom. well this lasted for a good bit of time and during all this a lady came out in her yard and tryed talking to me and stuff and 2 other guys showed up and helped me. they acctually helped unlike our wonderful law enforcement officer. so there were 3 of us and we got to surround her but then the emu started to run towards the woods on the one side of the road. this was bad for 2 reasons: 1) she jumped over the guard rail and now it would be nearly impossible to get her back over it, and 2) theres a stream in the woods on that side of the road so that means theres about a 6 ft slope going down. so bigbird decides to begin walking up the stream. suprisingly, one of the helpers that showed up started going after here through the stream. he followed close behind and got her pretty far. i was up on the road at the time and he started yelling "now, if i go to grab this thing, what is it going to do?" i gave him the warning then about the legs and stuff and all he said was "ok". right at that moment the guy makes a lunge for bigbird and brings her down to the ground. i was quite amazed considering the situation. so then hes sitting down in the stream holding the bird to the ground. then the cop showed up, well, he never left but he would have been more help if he did, and he gave me a rope to tie the emu up with. he was like "i use this for dogs", i was thinkin "im sure you do donut-dan" so i hopped over the guard rail and went down in the stream. the guy was still hangin onto bigbird as i tied the rope around her legs. it took a few trys cause she kept flailing about, but we eventually got her secure. then it was the hard part, getting her up the hill and over the guard rail. yet again, the helper amazed me when he just pick her up and started carrying her up the hill and over the rail. then my parents showed up with the truck and we loaded bigbird into te back. as we were leaving the cop told me "just bring the rope back to the station when your done"... like hes ever going to use it. but now bigbird is back in her pen. shes hasnt been doing too well though ever since the escape. shes almost completly lost her sense of balance. she has alot of trouble just standing up. im kinda worried, but ive learned from wheezy that emus can survive almost anything. (wheezy slit her throat and her esophagus was litteraly hanging out. she healed though and is fine now). so who knows whats going to happen next. Bigbird is up for sale for anyone interested in an emu. just let me know if your interested. i dont have much else to say. i leave you now with these words of wisdom "wow, that bird really looks tired! shes like, coughing!" "...no. shes breathing"

      interesting night. i just got back from the usual wednesday dinner at my grandfathers and my dad saw that one of the emus had gotten loose. i thought it was kinda odd cause there was only 1 other escape this summer and we fixed the fence where that one had taken place, also, if one got out of the pen, the other should have been close by. it all made sense when i saw that it was Bigbird who got out, not Pecker or Wheezy. she was the one we had to seperate from the others cause she always got picked on by her 'siblings'. she was kept in the barn, in her own stall. anyhow, i got a scoopful of cracked corn, but it didnt help too much cause she wasnt too hungry. i was able to get pretty close to her cause she hadnt been spooked yet, so i waited and then she started cleaning her feathers. that was the best thing to hope for at the time since she closes her eyes as she stokes her feathers with her beak. i jumped to grab her and i managed to catch one wing and as i went for the other, she slipped on the wet grass (gotta love the rain). but unfortuantly she fell towards my direction so that i went down with her. i couldnt keep my hold by that point and she quickly got up and ran towards the woods. for about an hour after that, it was just simply me walking behind her making sure she didnt run off in a direction that i knew she could escape in. my dad was helping me by that point and we got to remain in a location by the barn. then she got spooked and started running, but didnt know where to go so she stumbled a bit and my dad made an attempt to grab her. he managed to knock her down on the ground so i tryed to get ahold of of her wings. it is from this experince that i know have learned a very inportant lesson (and if your smart youll listen too): **never try to grab an emu while it is on its back** when i went for the wings, one of her legs gave me a very nice and swift punch to the chest. and now while i look at the mud stains in the shape of a emu foot on my shirt, im glad that i didnt lean in 5 inches closer at the last second. well, she rolled around on the ground some more since it was so slippery ourside, and while she rolled, she fell into the fence of the other emus. we hadnt secured the bottom of the wire mesh to the ground so she slipped right under it. now shes in the pen with the other emus, but we dont know how long thatll last before she gets out of there. i guess i gotta wait til morning to see what happens. and now, hers the the (hopefully not running) total points for the "Emu 2004 summer escape challenge": Pecker: 0... unexciting idiot Wheezy: 1... not as impressive as her 4, yes 4 escapes last year Bigbird: 2.5... ya, she had one earlier this summer and then we put her in the barn instead of the pen, then while in the barn one day she escaped into the other emu pen. while it was an escape, she wasnt completly free. well, im going to work on my character for my game now. if you want the update of progress, i have finished painting the skin so the model is complete. i have also found out how to give the character AI so that i can play against it when i want, i might tweek that a bit though so its just to my liking. all i have to do now (and this is the fun part) is to create the new sounds for the character. ok, time for me to make some noise. i leave you now with these words of wisdom, and yes, they do need to be repeated for everyones safety, "never try to grab an emu while it is on its back"

      odd title for an entry huh? ya, thats what i thought. im soooo happy right now cause i just learned how to create skins for the computer game jedi academy! for those of you who dont know what skinning is, its when you take a model from one of the characters from the game, and apply new colors to the outside. so basicaly, its just customizing the game characters. ive been wanting to learn how make modifcations like this for a while, but i never took the time to find a good tutorial to show me how to do it. there is one that is provided by the creator of the game, but it wasnt written in normal english unfortunatly. but i found this other one that explains exactly what to do, and its so much fun. right now ive been creating a skin of a gnoll, that wolf-like thing in the background (i think they look really neat). i nearly completed the head portion, and then i tryed to put that into the game, and the first time it didnt work cause i accidently made the file a .zip instead of a .pk3 (its amazing how much 3 letters can affect the out come of things). but after i repackaged the files i tryed the game and it worked! how awesome is that? now i can make my own characters and im planning on publishing the gnoll on  urlLink pcgamemods  when im finished, that way other people can download it and use it on their own game. for those of you who may be interested in the finished product, ill add a comment to this entry once ive uploaded the gnoll to the site so that you can see it. im going to go back to my new project right now, sorry for the mostly uninteresting post, but im just so happy i learned how make skins. i leave you now with these words of wisdom (from the skinning guide) "**** SEE HOW IT SAYS .TGA ? SCREW IT...ALL THE FILES YOU EDITED WERE EITHER .PNG OR .JPG.... I DON'T KNOW WHAT .TGA MEANS BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THE SKIN WILL WORK FINE."

      so today was my grandfathers birthday. hip hip hurray. so his big gift from his family was that we rented the theater in elizabeth and watch "gone with the wind" with him. he absolutly loves that movie. he has an entire room in his house dedicated to the film. anyhow, it was supposed to be the entire family to go see it, ya know, me, my sisters, my parents, and  my cousins.  but suprisingly (thats sarcasim) my cousins got out of seeing the movie. apparently my aunt has to work tommarow. she always gets out of any family obligation. the reason im so mad about it is because i wasnt able to get out of it. i mean, its "gone with the wind", the 4 hour movie. granted, its a real movie, not one of those pieces of crap films like 'the village'. but when the movie is 4 hours long, it isnt a movie anymore, its a marathon. it is a test of endurance to remain seated in a lightly padded chair while holding your eyelids open to watch a soap-opera put onto the silverscreen. well, its over now, so thats one good thing. we're pretty sure my grandfather enjoyed it, at least we hope he did. theres not much else to say for this entry, i think im just going to work on my page set-up some more. i leave you now with these words of wisdom "Quitin' time!", "You aint the forman, i says when its quitin time. Quitin' time!"
