       For the past week we have been sitting here waiting for Hurricane Charlie.  Cleavon went out and bought some canned goods, candles, water, a radio and little battery operated lights that he could hang on the walls for the kids.  We felt like true Floridians when we taped up the windows.  We stuffed our big gas grill in the little laundry closet.  He went out and bought board games because we were sure our electricity would be shut off.  We also let the icemaker over flow just to have some kind of cold in the freezer.   Although we are in a non-evacuation area, most of our neighbors were running for cover.  They were heading East and South.  We kept telling them it wasn't going to be that bad, we weren't going to feel the effects of the storm surge over here because we were far enough from the coast and on higher ground, we were mostly going to get the wind and the rain but it wasn't going to be that bad with a Cat 2, maybe 3, Hurricane.  We even laughed at them because they were so nervous.   In the morning the first we did was turn on the TV to watch the news and track the Hurricane.  Butterflies starting flying around my stomach as they said Charlie had reached Cat 4 strength.  Brace yourself Tampa Bay!!! Here comes Charlie!!!   "SIKE!!!!", says Charlie, "I think I will fool everyone and make a right turn into Fort Myers where they are not expecting me!"   Here in Tampa we got nothing more than sprinkles and minor wind not even strong enough to blow the leaves off the branches.  Yet where most people evacuated to, and felt they were safe, was devasted.  Charlie plundered South and East of us while I sat here waiting for some sign of the hurricane.  Not that I was wishing it upon myself but because I was expecting it, it's the only thing I heard about for the 3 days prior.   All in all I am thankful we were safe here in Tampa, but I feel sad for all the people who weren't expecting the hurricane, thus weren't prepared.  I feel sad for the thousands upon thousands who lost thier homes.  I feel sad for the families of the 15 dead and the ones missing.   Well, the moral of the story is -- You can never be certain when it comes to Mother Nature.  Us women have our own minds and we do what we want to!!!

						    Well, well, well.....   Here we have a guy that most that know him would say he had it all. He had a beautiful pregnant wife, a beautiful home, 2 cars and a dog. What else can you ask for? Everyone who knew them envied them and to know them was to love them. But looks can be very deceiving.   Lets see what we know now...   Scott meets Amber in Nov. One of his friends threaten to tell Amber, in the beginning of Dec., that he is married and Scott pleads with his friend to let him break it to Amber. The next day, instead of telling Amber the truth, he tells her that he lost his wife.   Days after that he checks the currents of the bay and AFTERWARDS buys a boat off of eBay (I think it was eBay).   Dec 23rd he tells friends and family that he was going to play golf on the morning of Dec 24th yet instead he goes "fishing" in the same bay he checked the currents for weeks earlier before buying the boat and the same bay the corpse of Laci and, then unborn child Conner, were later found.   After his pregnant wife "went missing", he was so distraught and hoping to find her that he called his mistress and was able to laugh it up with her telling her about the great time he was having in Europe. He was so distraught the he even had to speak to Amber during Laci's vigil.   Now, I'm not going to go check the archives of Court TV and type out here the other pieces of circumstantial evidence that has come out in court because, just with the little blog I typed out above, I'm convinced.   Before someone comes and bites my head off about the evidence being all circumstantial, lets remember that this is a circumstantial case. Just about all evidence is going to be circumstantial. What has to be done is tying all the circumstantial evidence together to show that ONLY Scott could have had the motive and opportunity to commit the murders.
