       "we're so filled with bugs and so beautiful at the same time"   Originally published in  urlLink Anthem Magazine  issue 10  It's been a rough year for Marc Bianchi. The 28 year-old musician behind Her Space Holiday broke up with longtime musical partner and girlfriend Keely this past March. Keely has always been the focus, directly and indirectly, of Her Space Holiday and Bianchi's newest record, 'The Young Machines' is no exception.   The first seven tracks on 'The Young Machines', he says, were written before the pair ended their nine-year relationship. The last three, perhaps the most honest and raw on the record (track nine, "Girl Problems", ends with Bianchi hollowly mouthing 'I will always think of you as someone that I love'), were written in the aftermath.  Bianchi used HSH as a tool-almost a third party-in his relationship, writing songs to say to Keely what he couldn't say in conversation. That, he says, is what helped break them up, and break down, in the end. "It destroyed it. It destroyed it in the way that we weren't able to evaluate where we were as people. We were moving too fast and I got caught up in the myth. I feel that I'm closer to her now then I ever have been. I feel sad that we didn't get to know each other in a way that we could have," he says.  Making 'The Young Machines' was part release and part reflection. "It was a huge wake up call to me. This relationship was the biggest thing that happened to me in my life. I think that I created a reality and bought into it for so many years." Even worse, he says," I created my own world and made it public. That's what temporarily made the world more concrete. But it was a half-truth. With this record, it was like showing me my lowest point and ugliest and most truthful sides."   Bianchi named this new record 'The Young Machines' because, he says, "we're so filled with bugs and so beautiful at the same time. The faults are what make the whole aesthetic and beautifulnessSˇI'm trying to rebuild. Making the upgrades and all that stuff." He trails off and then continues: "I don't know. Things are working out but even when things are good it's sad because it's unfamiliar."  Compounding that lack of the familiar will be all the touring Bianchi's got planned for the next year or so. It will hopefully give him some release and some space to get over his broken heart. "I hope people can see the ugliness in the record. All the songs on this record seem so different to me now. Hopefully people will be generous."

       media consolidation bites hard  Originally published in  urlLink  Rockpile    magazine, August 2003  This June the FCC issued a historic ruling to further deregulate media and allow for big business to control a larger piece of the pie. The decision outraged politicians and activists alike, and brought the media ownership debate to the forefront. There may soon be a whole lot less news in the newspaper and fewer songs on the radio. Cable TV plans may offer less programming and fewer networks. Why? This past June, the Federal Communications Commission voted three to two to further deregulate media, allowing for increased corporate consolidation of media. Why care? Because everything we read, watch or hear on radio, television and in newspapers is likely to be affected.    The FCC's proposed plan impacts three major areas. Previously, companies that owned broadcast organizations in one market couldn't own print organizations in the same market. The new ruling allows for cross ownership of media in large and medium-size markets. Where in the past broadcast companies were restricted from owning more than 35 percent of a market's share, the new plan would allow the nation's four national television networks and other group owners to buy enough television stations to reach 45 percent of the national audience. Further, under the old rules, corporations could only own two stations in one market (provided they were not large stations and there were eight other competitors). The FCC also relaxed this rule—now broadcasters may own three stations in the largest markets (Los Angeles, New York) where there are 18 stations. The recent ruling also allows companies a second channel in smaller markets where there are at least five stations—as long as one is not a top-four ratings earner.   Who benefits from all this deregulation? Immediately, large media corporations like Clear Channel, Viacom and News Corporation, Inc., stand to make a killing. All of this deregulation spells one thing—more money for big business, which has media activists, Congress and citizens up in arms. "In certain markets, there is a movement to consolidate the media so that one company could own the vast majority of information," says Kristin Thompson, Tsunami/Ken guitarist and co-founder of the Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit collaboration between members of the music, technology, public policy and intellectual property law sectors.   "[This includes] a newspaper, radio stations, TV stations and also the 'alternative' weekly. That becomes dangerous when there are not critical voices that are not independent of this corporate structure."   Future of Music, along with several other dozen media advocacy groups, have come together around the FCC ruling to form the Media Diversity Coalition, a broad-based collective from both left- and right-wing backgrounds. Hannah Sassaman, an activist with the Philadelphia-based Prometheus Radio Project (a partner organization in the Media Diversity Coalition), agrees the ruling will restrict individuals’ access to news and information. She also contends the FCC is putting corporate interests above the public’s needs. "Deregulation has a major economic impact—it saves corporations money," says Sassaman. "Through deregulation, they are able to consolidate and streamline their operations, which means jobs are lost and people get fired."   Such consolidation, says Sassaman, is reflected in a lack of local and critical media where the quality of life and the information available declines. According to Joel Barkin, spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Bernie Sanders (D-Vermont), public interest is at the heart of this battle. Sanders is one of several politicians from both parties who are outraged by the FCC’s ruling and have introduced anti-deregulation legislation. The ruling, argues Barkin, is not only a grievous charge against the public interest, but also a possible threat to public safety. For example, he paints a scenario where medication X is causing harmful side effects, but the company in control of local TV and radio outlets also manufactures medication X. "Ironically, the FCC was founded to protect the public interest," says Barkin.   In fact, the FCC still includes a period for public comment whenever new rulings are being discussed. In the case of the deregulation decisions, more than 750,000 people weighed in, via emailed and written comments. Of those, more than 98 percent were opposed to further deregulation. "Overwhelmingly, people did not want deregulation, but it didn’t seem to stop the FCC," says Barkin. Thompson sites similar figures, explaining how part of the problem is people simply had no idea that this was happening.   "There was a survey released by the Project for Excellence in Journalism in February 2003 that said 72 percent of people had not heard about this deregulation, and when they heard about it, were very concerned." Why are so many people so ill-informed about media consolidation? In large part it’s because major media simply doesn’t want the public to know. Continues Thompson, "Despite the magnitude of this ruling, the changes have been covered very little in mainstream press. We found it particularly concerning that network television didn’t cover the story at all. Obviously many of the companies that own network TV and major newspapers have a vested interested in the outcome of this ruling." Hopefully, says Thompson, this will generate some activism and some backlash from folks who are concerned about the preservation of free speech and democracy. As she points out, sometimes bigger is not better.   Sassaman is hoping the wealth of public and Congressional outrage about these deregulation rulings may have a long term affect on how the FCC functions. "What would be interesting is if we were really able to redefine how the FCC works so the parts of media policy that need the input of the public—like the media ownership policies—be placed in the hands of those who are directly accountable to the public," she urges. "We, as citizens, have a major responsibility to keep the pressure on."

           Originally appeared in  urlLink this edition  of  Philadelphia Weekly .  It's been a while since Internet porn was just for your pervy cubicle mate--especially since the 2001 launch of the Suicide Girls' punk-infused naughty porn website, which attracts the pale, skinny and socially maladjusted with a fetching array of pierced, dyed and tattooed young women.      There's certainly no shortage of online alterna-porn sites--competitors include BurningAngel.com and Supercult.com--but Suicide Girls seems to have cornered most of the market. In the last three years the site has moved into the mainstream, attracting legions of fans both in and out of the punk rock and goth scenes.   Now the Girls are taking it on the road, hitting the stage at the Trocadero (itself a former burlesque theater) with a new kind of strip show. They've been winding their way across the country, a rollicking caravan of real live (almost) nude girls.   The genesis of the tour was a weekly burlesque revue in the Suicide Girls' home city of Portland, Ore., and the tour is buoyed by the massive swarm of Suicide Girls fans and site members.   For a small monthly fee--much less than a typical mainstream porn site--members can access Suicide Girls' collection of goth, punk, indie and emo (yes, emo) girls in various poses, scenarios and stages of undress.   And while antiporn activists like Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon may shudder at the thought of porn spreading through the subculture, there's no shortage of fans. The site receives a healthy half a million hits per week.   There's also no shortage of goth and punk girls who want to model for the site.   "I get about a hundred applications a day from women who want to be Suicide Girls," says 26-year-old Missy (who asked that her last name not be used), the founder and curator of the site.   Started out of her cramped Portland apartment, the site has grown from three models (including Missy) to a roster of more than 250 girls.   Why are so many alterna-girls clamoring to bare it all on the site? Maybe it's because Suicide Girls was crafted with the 1950s pinup aesthetic in mind, and doesn't seem quite as seedy and explicit as other online porn sites.   "I've always had an affinity for pinup girls. I loved the way they had this air of sexy, cool confidence," Missy says. "Pinup girls didn't seem like they were objects. They were letting you adore them instead of being objects created to be adored."   Likewise, so much of Suicide Girls is really about--as the website proclaims--"a contemporary lifestyle brand combining the DIY attitude of underground culture with a vibrant, sex-positive community of women (and men)."   Every Suicide Girl gets her own Friendster-like profile and journal page so members can really get to know them. Models post on the site's message boards, write journal entries and do on-site interviews.   The result is that Suicide Girls has forged a unique online community of sex-positive people. Yes, they're looking to get off, but they're also interested in making meaningful connections.   "I've gotten emails from girls who are like, 'In high school I was an outcast and I was always teased, and now I see all these pictures of these girls that look like me, and they have all these comments that tell them they look beautiful. It just makes me feel so much more confident,'" says Missy.   She adds, "I wanted to create something where my friends could be appreciated for who they were. The photos start out fully clothed and end up fully nude, and they're all tasteful. I wanted to create a place where they could be showcased and be appreciated, and I wanted to do it with the same sense of beauty, respect and admiration that the pinup girls were shot with."   And Missy is convinced that men are as into the idea of tasteful, respectful porn as women. Though she declined to give exact numbers, she says roughly just as many men visit the site as women do.   "Men are tired of the whole oversaturation of sex, and the appeal of the demure is coming back," she says.   The burlesque show, Missy says, "pushes the limits of what's legal" while still remaining true to the punk rock aesthetic. "They dance to everything from the Ramones to Modest Mouse to the Rapture. It's a unique, sexy, funny, entertaining experience."   Aside from the burlesque show, several dozen Suicide Girls just finished wrapping up a video shoot for Dave Grohl's new band, Probot. Models have also gotten jobs and met boyfriends and girlfriends through the site.   Says Missy, "It's like punk rock networking. I'm amazed by the impact Suicide Girls had on other people's lives--that so many people could know about it and identify with something that I did."   Suicide Girls Burlesque Tour, Wed., Feb. 4, 8pm. $14. 18+ Trocadero, 1003 Arch St. 215.922.LIVE. www.thetroc.com

       Originally appeared in  urlLink this edition  of the   Philadelphia Weekly     Conan the Barbarian DVD   Here's the pertinent info on Conan: The bare-bones plot involves a young boy (Conan) whose entire family is killed by an evil warlord (played, naturally, by James Earl Jones). Conan eventually grows up and goes on a killing spree to avenge his parents' death. Now that you know the entire plot, skip the movie and go right to the commentary on the DVD. Listen to Conan director John Milius and Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger wax philosophical on Conan, the meaning of truth ("steel is truth") and freedom ("freedom is the wolves"). Schwarzenegger apparently never learned the difference between reality and fiction, and refers to the character of Conan in the first- person throughout the film, as in: "Here is where I get laid by the Wolf Witch, heh heh heh," and "This is when I am breaking his head." Talk about a comedy goldmine.    Seed Magazine    A nerd-cool fledgling science magazine for the scientifically challenged, Seed takes on all the things you wish you'd paid attention to in chemistry class. If, like me, you had a ninth-grade biology teacher who made you cry and tried to ruin your spotless grade point average, chances are you're no astrophysicist. Of course, most of us aren't, which is why the magazine is so rad. Attempting to explore how "science is redefining our sense of self and our understanding of where we come from and where we're heading," the magazine is high-minded but reads like Us Weekly. Recent issues include articles on stuff like the evolution of the universe, a biological explanation of anorexia and a historical analysis of eugenics. It'll definitely make you feel at least 10 percent smarter.     BBC on NPR    Each weekday morning on WHYY (90.9 FM) from 9 to 10 a.m., Philly receives a self-possessed missive from BBC News Hour host Julian Marshall and his band of likeminded Brits that rises above the jingoistic war coverage of Fox News, CNN, MSNBC and their brethren. Marshall and crew are smart, reserved and a bit snarky. They pronounce things with a funny British emphasis: Controversy is controversy. The BBC sort of hates the U.S. and British Prime Minister Tony Blair and never misses an opportunity to sneer something about "those [detestable] Americans," which, in these moralistic, overbearingly patriotic times, is goddamned refreshing.    The Autograph Man's Alex-Li Tandem    The main character in Zadie Smith's second book has a drug problem, a girlfriend problem and an unfortunate delusional obsession with a faded '50s American film star. Jewish-Chinese Alex-Li Tandem is a more cracked and callous Holden Caulfield type--a mass of neuroses, ticks and asshole impulses. But he just might be a genius. Tandem's major long-term project (and fun subway pastime) is a book called Jewishness and Goyishness, an effort to classify the world into gentile and Jewish categories. It works like this: "Jewish trees (sycamore, poplar, beech), Goyish trees (oak, Sitka, horse chestnut); Jewish smells of the 17th century (rose oil, sesame, orange zest), Goyish smells of the 17th century (sandalwood, walnuts, wet forest floor)." Being a Jew myself, and also being obsessed with organization and categorization, I think this is a good idea.    The Swan and I Want a Famous Face    In the category of life-imitating-The Simpsons-imitating-life is the current slew of plastic surgery disasters. While there's a contingent of people who claim to totally detest these shows, I'm shameless. I'm still going to watch and watch, even if it's The Swan. Described by most critics and plain old television viewers as the most appalling, abominable series Fox execs could have ever conceived, The Swan radically makes over a smattering of 16 "self-described ugly ducklings" through intensive surgery, waxing, dental work and exercise regimens before choosing one whose transformation is most "incredible." The series' emphasis on building these women up just to knock them down (the show's incessant mantra is "There will only be one swan!") is truly cruel--and immensely watchable. Battling The Swan for nip-and-tuck supremacy is MTV's I Want a Famous Face, a weekly half-hour-long foray into the hearts and minds of the sick, deluded and Pamela Anderson-obsessed. Take the grossly acned twin brothers on one recent episode who want to look like Brad Pitt. After undergoing myriad surgeries, skin peels and a healthy dose of Retin-A, the boys just look more like weird twins. One of Famous Face's most heart-wrenching victims was someone we'll call J. Lo Trannie. J. Lo Trannie was a beautiful transvestite with an unhealthy fixation on Jennifer Lopez. After undergoing breast implants, a hairline transplant, cheek and collagen implants, J. Lo Trannie looked less J. Lo and more trannie.

       playing by numbers  Originally appeared in  urlLink  Anthem   magazine, issue 11.  It’s unusually humid for mid-September in Philadelphia and Numbers have just finished playing an intensely sweaty set at the city’s First Unitarian Church. Having switched out of their onstage get-ups (matching white shirts emblazoned with geometric symbols), the band just wants to get in their car. And sit. In the air conditioning.      But unfortunately, for now, the car is off-limits, blocked by a band of teenagers performing an unusually aggressive impromptu set in the alley next to the church. As bouncers and promoters scramble to turn the music down (for fear of upsetting the church’s neighbors and compromising the bands playing inside the venue) Numbers drummer and vocalist Indra Dunis, keyboardist Eric Landmark and guitarist Dave Broekema settle for a spot in the breeze on the steps of the building.   Wiping the sweat from her lanky legs, Indra explains the origins of the outfits. “Oh, yeah, we try to wear stuff on tour every once in a while that’s different. The stuff we were wearing tonight I made in the van on the way here,” she says.   Cars and fashion, it makes perfect sense. Just as much sense as Numbers trademark sound––repetitive and dance-y beats over Indra’s sexy, growling yelps.   Numbers, who met more than a decade ago in sleepy Madison, Wisconsin, while in college, moved to San Francisco together in 1998. They weren’t even a band yet, just friends with a blind desire to live on the coast. “We moved to S.F. and we didn’t know anyone who was doing anything,” says Dave, who along with Eric used to play in experimental band Xerobot. Xerobot ended soon after the pair moved to San Francisco.  As Xerobot was ending, Indra was beginning to learn drums. “I was trying to play with people I met through an ad in the paper, but that really wasn’t working out,” says Indra. “After Xerobot ended, Dave was ready to quit music and sell his guitar,” she continues, “and I was like, ‘nooooooo! You’ve got to keep playing!’”  Indra, Eric and Dave played together for a year before playing a live set, because, says Dave, “there weren’t any bands in San Francisco that we liked and wanted to play with.”  Nearly overnight, though, the band saw a huge influx of new musicians and bands into the city––lesser known experimental artists like Pink and Brown and The Lowdown. Oh, and Erase Errata. “We saw Erase Errata play their second show ever, and thought, ‘man, they are so great. I would love to play with them,’ and that was really inspiring,” remembers Indra.   It’s little wonder then that Numbers are so excited right now to be on the road with Erase Errata for a month-long U.S. tour. They’ve even skipped the mixing and art design of their second full-length record to be here.   Once this new record is released next January, Numbers is hoping to head out on the road again, touring both the U.S. and Europe. Until then, they’re concerned with more mundane things. Only two weeks into tour, and Indra is already contemplating what she’ll do when she gets back to San Fran.  “I’m really looking forward to sleep and laundry and renting some movies. Oh yeah, and I really want to get a burrito.”

       andrew w.k. parties, like, hard.  Originally published in  urlLink   Rockpile    November 2003      It’s 7 p.m. and Andrew WK is late for a photo shoot. The photographer is inside the venue, no doubt pensive and nervous, waiting for his star subject to show up. The band’s road manager knocks on the tour bus door for the second time. Andrew looks up from the autograph he’s been furiously scribbling in block letters, and with all the concentration he can muster, mentally rearranges the minutes and hours in the day to make sure the photographer gets what he needs. If he had his way, Andrew WK would spend every hour of every day either on stage or with his fans. Ideally his fans—the kids—would just, you know, hang and rock out with him all the time. After all, they’re the ones he wants to teach about going all the way, doing your best, and, in a manner of speech, partying ‘til you puke.   For now, though, Andrew WK is signing an autograph for a friend of a friend. “To Paulo: I hear you’re a great pal and buddy! Keep on being awesome. Your friend, Andrew WK,” he’s scrawled on an 8” x 10” photo. “Do we have a poster we can give him?” asks Andrew, calling down the cavernous and leather-clad tour bus before bounding toward the front of the hull and attacking a pile of glossy sheets. Seconds later he’s managed to come up with another impossibly AWK thing to say: “Dear Paulo, You know that feeling when everything is so good and you realize that everything is okay? You know that feeling? It is the truth!!! Never forget it!!! Your friend, Andrew WK, 2003.”      This, in short, is Andrew WK’s message, the philosophy he lives by and the reason he makes the feel-good, larger than life rock stuff for which he’s become famous “When I was a kid I looked up to these older guys who played in bands,” says the born Midwestener. “Sometimes they were cool, but sometimes they gave me a hard time.” Looking at the 6’ 4”, long-haired WK (short for his surname Wilkes-Krier), it’s hard to believe anyone ever stepped to him, especially in those golden days of star Michigan bands like Current, Ottowa, Jihad and, Andrew’s own, Kathode. Nevertheless, says WK, this is why he now insists on stopping for every fan he can, writing intricate and personal autographs and, oh yes, calling fans and supporters on the phone. WK’s website currently boasts a special promotional offer—he’s personally phoning 1,000 fans to thank them for buying his newest record,  The Wolf . And he means it.   “I just want to be that guy that doesn’t let anyone down,” he says, identifying his high ambition. “I feel like I am really lucky and I have so much to give. If I can keep doing this for as long as possible, then why shouldn’t I?” As he talks, the 24-year-old rocker’s eyes flit between the wall, the floor and the tour bus table, littered with beer cans, juice bottles and paper cups. He absentmindedly pours leftover juice into a beer can, finishes adjusting the air conditioner and continues. Just try to keep up.   Listening to Andrew WK is like listening to a brilliant motivational speaker. It’s easy to see the parallels. WK lives to spread positive energy and good feelings. “I have so much to give, and I realized the more you give, the more you get in return,” he reasons. “I couldn’t give as much as I do if I wasn’t getting so much back from all my fans. It’s not as hard as everyone thinks it is.” “Like this,” he reflects, picking up a backstage pass from a show earlier that week. “I could throw it out, but if I keep it and give it to some kid who’s really into us, it could make his day. Yeah, I’m going to save it.”   With that, he plunges the laminated souvenir into the pocket of his tight, stone-washed jeans. Though he has released four full-length records so far—the first two were little-heard records released on indie label Hanson—it was his third release, I Get Wet, that caused the massive explosion of notoriety. Within months, Andrew’s material was licensed for Twix and Expedia.com commercials, his video for “Party Hard” was on heavy MTV rotation, and (completing the doltish, metalhead image that many assume to be the real deal), Andrew appeared on a scant few episodes of the juvenile stunt show, Jackass.   In reality though, he's hyper-quick and almost frighteningly smart. At age four, Andrew began playing piano, although he says he didn’t grow up immersed in rock ‘n roll—saving him the predictable list of idols. In his teen years, Andrew played in some underground groups in Michigan before moving to New York at 18. Though he admits to a checkered, delinquent-kid past, he says all that changed after he was mugged one of his first days in New York. “I don’t believe in karma or anything, and I still continued to steal and stuff,” he confesses. “But it made me feel like I got what I deserved for all of the stupid things I did.”   Through all of his music AWK has emphasized one, singular message—party hard. While this sentiment taken literally might appeal most to ex-frat boys, it’s not as hedonistic and simple as it sounds. “It means whatever you want it to mean,” WK ruminates on the universal definition of “party.” “It means, whatever you do, do it big. With this record, I wanted the biggest sound possible, taking in the history of all the music ever made and just bringing it to the next level.” The result is a dozen or so songs of anthemic rock proportion. In addition to Andy’s by-now signature party songs,  The Wolf  diversifies. WK includes a couple of love songs (“Make Sex” and “Really in Love”) on the new release. And while he tours with a full band (including ex-Obituary drummer Don Tardy and three guitarists), WK produced and recorded  The Wolf himself . He had the record mixed by engineer Dave Way, who has worked with everyone from Michael Jackson to Christina Aguilera and Macy Gray.   Things have a way of working out for WK. Take Dave Way. “I had a whole list of guys that I could maybe get to produce the record,” Andrew explains. “I knew that he was the one. Everybody thought I was crazy because Dave had more of a background in pop records. But, I called him up and his manager said, ‘Oh, he’s a huge fan of you, he’d love to work on your album!’ I couldn’t have done it with anyone else. It was perfect.”   And what about scoring ex-Obituary drummer Don Tardy? Echoing a high-school wrestling coach’s mantra, Andrew WK believes in “going big.” After recording the first batch of material for I Get Wet, he, on a whim, contacted Tardy, his “favorite drummer of all-time.” “I made him a tape with my stuff, and wrote him this letter and asked him if he might want to play with me sometime in my band,” Andrew shares, as if it’s standard practice. “Then I drew out the Obituary logo on the back of the envelope and sent it out to him.” With typical AWK luck, Tardy replied a few weeks later, excited to play. That’s just how it works out for Andrew WK. We should all party so hard.

       all these things in no true order  Find this  urlLink here    Our Critics Top Albums of 2003 Strokes, Shins and a whole lot of OutKast   This year, the diverse blend of hip-hop, funk and soul -- not to mention comedy -- found on OutKast's Speakerboxxx/The Love Below dazzled sufficiently to top our annual critics' poll. Andre 3000 and Big Boi's sprawling two-CD set appeared on eight lists, just one more than Chutes Too Narrow, the second release by brainy indie rockers the Shins.   Despite the hype surrounding the two of the biggest "The" bands since the Beatles and the Stones, the Strokes and the White Stripes pulled in fewer votes for their respective 2003 releases (four) than did the latest offerings from grunge godfather Neil Young and long under-appreciated power-pop outfit Fountains of Wayne (both with five).  Other favorites ran the gamut from the late, great Johnny Cash, to prolific hip-hop phenom Missy Elliott to newcomers bearing the flags of yesteryear: southern rock (Kings of Leon), prog-rock (the Mars Volta) and folk rock (Damien Rice). Clay and Ruben may demand a recount.  Julie Gerstein  1. Her Space Holiday, The Young Machines (Mush Records): A beautifully crafted exercise in breaking up, Marc Bianchi cultivates a sad and lush goodbye.  2. Black Eyes, S/T (Dischord): An all-out percussive explosion, Black Eyes full-length debut is a shock of noisy bliss.  3. Postal Service, Give Up (Sub Pop): Figurine frontman Jimmy Tamborello's guilty emo-fueled pleasure, sure to make the girls swoon.  4. Devon Sproule, Upstate Songs (City Salvage): Perhaps the sweetest and most honest folk-pop album recorded this year, Sproule's vocal and lyrical beauty is unmatched.  5. Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, Hearts of Oak (Lookout): Includes "Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone," a monumental pop achievement, and even better live.  6. The Twin Atlas, Bring Along the Weather (Tappersize): Delicate acoustic folk-pop songs in the perfect pitch.  7. Need New Body, UFO (File 13 Records): Explosive and experimental, Need New Body's sophomore release is a carnival of melody and noise.  8. The Rapture, Echoes (Universal): The new sound of sex, the Rapture's most recent is a sweaty mess of guitars and samples.  9. Slumber Party, Three (Kill Rock Stars): Slumber Party's Three is a mass of melodic and mesmerizing Raincoats-esque rock.  10. The Kills, Keep on Your Mean Side (Sanctuary): The cheeky-named VV and Hotel are much more  rollicking and sensual than that other rock and roll duo.  Reissue: Sonic Youth, Dirty (DGC): Sonic Youth in its hey day, resonating with noisy ecstasy.

          Deerhoof   Milk Man  (Kill Rock Stars)   It makes sense that Deerhoof's seventh full-length record  Milk Man  opens with singer Satomi Matsuzaki urging listeners to "come closer." The saccharine chorus of the title track reflects all that Deerhoof have done to add a softer element to their frenetic, delirious expressions. A loosely rendered concept album,  Milk Man  is the story of an unseemly Sandman/Pied Piper-like character who lures unassuming innocents into his lair -- a fitting narrative base to Deerhoof's chaotic and creepy clatter. Much like Milk Man the character,  Milk Man  the record subtly draws listeners in with stark blurts of innuendo and expectation. Matsuzaki's childlike vocals arranged over guitarists Rob Fisk and John Dieterich and drummer/keyboardist Greg Saunier's loopy, prog-rock melodies, create a sublime sound -- an aural train wreck of noise and shimmer -- and a gloriously contradictory record with a sweeter feel than Deerhoof's previous offerings.

       Originally appeared July 6, 2004  Review can be found  urlLink  here        Maritime Glass Floor (Desoto)  Call it post post-rock: Formed from the remnants of emo-poster boys Promise Ring and punk-rockers Dismemberment Plan, Maritime cut songs with a rare unironic pop sensibility. Yes, Glass Floor begins with the whimpering melancholy "The Window Is the Door," but then the record takes a turn for the quirky, offering little pop gems rife with rich melodies and vocalist Davey von Bohlen's quietly teasing lyrics. Just like Get Up Kid Matthew Pryor (and his mid-life band the New Amsterdams), Promise Ring's von Bohlen's grown up and settled down. There's a warmly insular, suburban quality to his songs, reflected in tracks like "Someone Has to Die" -- "I don't care what happens in Argentina, yeah, or way up north off the coast of Norway on an island with no name." These days, von Bohlen's content to croon sly songs about love and loss, and it suits him -- and Maritime's shining debut record -- just fine.

       Originally appeared in   urlLink  Anthem   magazine issue 11.   Asking critical questions about the troublesome relationship between our external and internal forms, Christa Donner’s work features bodies in conflict and struggle, lungs protruding through the rib cages, hearts extending out of the chest and down arms.      Why this focus on the physical? In many ways, Donner’s body has been her blessing and her curse. Growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana with artist parents (“I grew up knowing that I could juggle my various interests––art, writing, connecting people and things––and that being an artist could be a perfectly viable career if I was willing to do without a lot of luxuries,” she says), Donner attended college at the Cleveland Institute of Art. It was her brief in-between stint as a print and runway model (once appearing in the now-defunct Sassy magazine) that led her to question the roles and spaces that women’s bodies occupy in culture. Exploring the complicated mythologies of women’s bodies, Donner’s work examines the difficulty of keeping our physical forms working, healthy, moving and alive.   “Questions about my health, “ she says, “along with mixed messages from friends, doctors and random strangers, pushed me to start making art about my own complicated health and body image issues.” Pairing images of fashion models with real and imaginary internal systems, Donner’s art “visualizes the internal and external connections I feel but can’t see,” she says.   Now living and working in Columbus, Ohio, Donner has a unique perspective on body image and mass media, and feels a responsibility to educate her audience about the struggles women face to keep their bodies going. "Whenever I can, " says Donner, "I accompany my art with workshops and panel discussions focusing on body image, mass media, art and activism. Participants learn a simplified version of my own process––honing in on a part of the body they feel uncomfortable with in some way and giving it power through writing and art-making.”  In addition to developing and creating her own art, Donner recently co-curated a show at SPACES Gallery in Columbus, Ohio. An amalgam of zines, comics and artist-made books, the show––called Page Me––reflects Donner’s personal interest and experiencing with self-publishing. For several years, she’s produced a zine called Ladyfriend–– covering all things girl and feminist.   “Most of my art is a solo thing––very personal, just me and my headphones. But my work with zines and comics has started to change that to some extent. I’ve started collaborating with a few writers to create more narrative stuff,” she says.   And it’s zines and artist books that most excite and influence her. “The art I like the best tends to be in print form: old medical illustrations and alternative comics. I’m literally obsessed with them. I love the work of Paul Pope, Chris Ware, Dame Darcy, Kerry James Marshall, Julie Doucet, and Farel Dalrymple. In the ‘fine art’ world, I love a lot of the immersive installation art that’s being created right now, but there’s nothing that I can think of that directly inspires what I do the way that comics do,” she says. “I hope to teach some classes on the subject some day, because I need somewhere to channel all the information I’m soaking up.”
