						   On 17th July, Saturday I went to Bardoli again for full payment and paper work. On Sunday 1st time I drive my car from Khajurdi (mama’s home) to Dungari (Highway tak). When I put 1st gear I started like Maruti 800. My cousin said it’s not a tractor ki you need to put so much effort for it. Then I was driving like BEST bus steering. After that I drive quit good.   Today on 20th July I joined drive school all though I have Light Motor Vehicle driving license.

						   It was sunday (11th july 2004) and I was at my mama's home ...On that day We wake up early and start for Bardoli with my cousin in their ZEN. We are 4. In which 2 have very good knowledge of cars named Janak and Lalit. When we passed Navsari Janak start calling to his friend which was car mela agent. So @ 10:30 we reached to his (Rakeshbhai Janak’s friend) shop. Rakeshbhai came with one ZEN VX of 2001 for us. Janak took trial of it but we couldn’t proceed more b’cos my budget was low (Rs.1.6-7) and it was cost 2.0+(2.30) then Rakeshbahi called one onther wagner. But it was all most same cost as ZEN VX. So we moved ahead and went for snacks.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now real picture started, earlier was just trailer for us. Now we entered into “Bardoli Car Mela”. There were 15-20 Car Melas and on an average 80-100 cars In each. I was amazed. Around 2-4 hours we spend and took a look of 50-80 cars most of them were Maruti ZEN. At last we took some rest and tried to decide now what was the next plan. Only 3-4 ZEN we found suitable for me and 1 Sentro. We tried Maruti 800 also but it wasn’t work well. So we decided for Sentro and at same place 1 Cheri color ZEN. But when we reached there Janak called up Rakeshbhai for the ZEN which we saw in morning and tried to negotiate him fewer than 2. He said he would let us know in 15-20 mints. So we went for Bardoli special KHICHADI-KADHI. After Khichadi-kadhi we again went to Rakeshbhai’s shop for finalized the deal. Janak started negotiation also Nimish (my cousin) put some extra points. Now Rakehsbhai stuck at 2.15 and Janak at 1.95 at last Janak said we will give 2+ whatever as per me that would be the final one. But Rakehsbhai stuck at 2.15. So I spoke 2+ 6989 (which was registration number of the car). And My cousin put 10K in Rakeshbhai for finalized the deal. At last Rakeshbahi said 2.09 is final price. We also agree on condition they have to give one tire which was spare one.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We started from Bardoli at 8:00PM for Khajurdi. My plan was to go to Valsad and reached Pune as early as possible. But after dinner I decided to go to Khajurdi to meet mama and arrange the extra 40-45 K. I met mama and mami and talk up to midnight.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next day morning once we decided that I have to go Pune and transfer money in Mama’s account, I started as early as possible and reached Pune 5:00PM. I went to office 5:30 and collect some document. I asked my all near and dear friend to come with me for helping me in money transfer. At last one of my office-met (Prasad Pakal) was ready to come with me. We searched for currier service but at the end we decided to mailed document thru speed post. And with the help of Prasad Pakala I managed to deposit 50K. Next day I started with my roomies (4). 1st we withdrew 95K from HDFC. Then tried to deposit it into ICICI but she said it would charged 5 Rs. Per 1000. One of my roomies (Sardar – Jassi – gr8 Mathematics) calculated and told why we wasting nearly 5000 for transferring money. So we again went to HDFC for deposited the money now they said they want my PAN card. So me and Pali went to office and brought my PAN card mean while I calculated the got tha Jassi’s mistake. At last we deposited 50K cash in HDFC and 45K cash in ICICI and 50K thru cheque. On Wednesday again me and Jassi went to banks and transfer 10K.

						   Yesterday, when my cell rang I suddenly wake up and attend that call. The call was from my papa (in USA). They gave me good news "My sister (Darshana in UK) gave birth to baby boy." I was so happy at that time. I also talk with my elder sister (Pushpa in USA). And give her a list of items which I want from USA when my dad will visit to India. I also added to bring special gift (Caps) for my roomies.  Then I started to get ready for office. On that day we had meeting with Suhash. What we thought ...it’s self appraisal meeting. So we entered with very relax mood. Then we heard about reducing no of head count. That time our fuse was burned. From our ecr team 4 peoples are getting laid off. That was very sad moment for us. Then we came out of the conference room. Again within few mints we had anther meeting of managers. Same point announced in different words. Within few mints whole India office went into sad mode. After taking lunch just we settled out on our seat. 1st Pankaj phone rang up. I was seating just beside him so I started praying for him and for all. Those few moments were very long for me. In between, Uday came up with some additional information. Pali meight get shifted into some other team (PowerXL). Pali just came back and sat on his chair. Without seeing to his face I just typed two words to him on msn chat ...”Kaya huva?”. He replied “Tempest team shifted”. I took very deep breath and said Good congrats. Now the real battle started 1st Summit who was working under me so I really very much worried about him in morning his in-laws came so he was in good mood all of sudden his faced was cleared. He went into Suhash cabin. When he came back …. All I can reed on this face… nobody asked him anything for the moment. Then Sanjay went to Summit and asked few questions. Then some few more members went to Summit’s place. Now everybody was into real sock. I was just remembering the Matrix scene. The phone rang and the man was out of the picture. Then Sanjay, Rashmi and Mahesh went thru same way.

						   It was 21st July 2004 I had called up at my friend Rakesh patel's home. His father Rameshbahi told me “your letter was there from US visa center” I was so enthusiastic about what letter it was … they added “Something you need to fill up” So I told try to send it thru courier but it was not worked out. And I was not plan to go Bilimora on 23rd July (Friday). So I was eager to go home asap but at the same time I want to go for interviews. B’cos my company lay off 4 people from my team few days ago. Without giving more thoughts I decided to go home for collecting visa paper and I booked return ticket as well.  I started on 30th July Friday 2:o0PM from Pune from Neeta Volvo(My roomi-Jangir booked my ticket for Metrol link but it was canceled and on the fly I got Neeta Volvo which was 20-25 mints late.) I expected to reach Mumbai around 6:00PM but due to heavy rain and traffic jam I reached at 6:30PM at Andheri. I reached station at 6:45PM but missed Flying Rani. So I reached home @ 11:55PM by Lok sakati Express from Borovali.  Next day Rain was continuing its inning, all though I started from home around 2:30PM for Valsad on bike to meet Visa agent. My 1st route was failed due to heavy water on road so I took 4-5 Kms around and reached Valsad after 1 hour 45 mints drive. I changed cloths at my mausi’s home and went to agent’s office. After facing some more difficulties I did with fill up “the Choice of Address and Agent form”. I came back to Bilimora at 7:15PM.  I was back to Pune on Monday (2nd August) morning 5:00AM and went to office around 10:00AM (rain was continuing ...). Again I started with searching courier service for sending that “the Choice of Address and Agent form”. After investigating a lot and due to heavy rain I decided to go at nearest courier service @ 4:00PM. (After 2-3 hours of waiting ...raining… raining...). I went 2-3 courier service center whichever near to our office but it wasn’t work. So I went to FedEX at Dhole Patil Road (30-45 mints drive). I was completely wet. After 20-30 mints wait I some how managed to courier the Choice of address form. I was back to office around 5:45PM and changed the cloths.  Just now I check status of the courier “Delivered/PORTSMOUTH NH  08/04/2004 09:13  ”.
