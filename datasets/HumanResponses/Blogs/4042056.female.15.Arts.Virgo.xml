      Here are some updates on the main players in my life just because I can do this here without anyone ever reading/judging:  Emily B:   Well, after she stopped going to school altogether I realized that she's taken it all wayyy to far. So what, you have problems like everyone else! Grow up and deal with them and get off your 12 medications. We're all depressed, that's why we're human. Seriously, it's all in herhead! Gah! I wish i could just yell at her and make her realize this!  Taylor S:   Blah, always up and down. Love and hate. Whatever. I care so much, but I also have seen how fucked up our relationship can be, so I really and getting tired of investing my emotional happiness in it. I tried to give my all, and it wasn't enough for him. He's screwed me over one too many times so now I just expect the bullshit and think, whatever, it's supposed to be superficial anyways because he's leaving. So although part of me still wishes more than anything that he'd be the one, I realize he doesn't act like it, and if he is, it's a real pity. But I still love him, so there's no sense ending it now, I'll wait it out.  Nicole P:   Wow... we used to be such good friends, and now we're just not! Seriously, it's like the friendship justdied. Yesterday was warped tour and that was great to spend the day with her and colin, but it's the first time all summer. And I don't think it's possible to ever see her without colin. I mean it's cute, theyre in love. But isn't this the exact same thing she's done with all the other boyfriends? Oh yes, that's right, it is. But I do wish we were still close. Although there are some big problems I have with her, I still love her and she's one of my good friends, so i don't want to lose it completely. We'll see what happens.  Jamie S.:   Another former close friend. We were realllly close and then I became closer with brendan (who i lost for the most part as well) and things got bad with my mom and I got depressed and he did his whole "friendship test" thing, and it was lost i guess. I didn't mean for us to drift, but at the end of the year, it just kinda happened. Since then I've talked to him and hung out with him, but I'm unsure about our friendship... how genuine it is. But last time I talked to him, he seemed to have forgotten that he hated me, or something. So that's good I think, perhaps I can pretend we never stopped being friends? I'll try, because I really need all the friends I can get.  Parents: My mom and I are finally starting to be normal again. After all the drama and such we both realized it works better to back off and just say whatever. But we do have some bad times still, which atre pretty bad. I dont think i'll ever forgive some of the stuff she said and did. She was more hurtful than she could know.  And as far as my dad- havent talked to him in months. Which i suppose is good. Probably for the best since it would just be bad times with him too. I just want to get away from them. Come to think of it, I want to get away from most everyone... I just want a break from life.

       (Another journal entry transferred. I had only written in it a couple times.)   mm, writing in this thing again? Well I mean I only took a year off (minus one day)... So anyways, wow, I'm still with Taylor so that's pretty sweet. Though somne things are aggrevating. I love him, but gras! So he's been gone (like last summer) since july 1st, in CO. It's a good opportunity and experience and such for him but it's really annoying for me. We talk on the phone when we can, but it's really not enough. We're both lonely and get depressed and it's just stupid. Last night he cut himself for the first time. What a little hypocrite. All the time explaining how it's against him etc. to do that. He's like the reason I stopped. And now he starts. Fuck that- it makes my counting on his strength and using that as inspiration and such worthless. Well whatever, I'm better than that. I'm better than the people who need that. I can stop whenever I want, thant's another reason I did stop, I don't want to put myself in the same category as the pathetic souls who "need to hurt themselves to distract from the pain of life." Bah. I realized- deal with it! Life sucks, whatever, get used to it dammit. And although on occasion I have a sort of slip (like in a fight with someone I scratch myself, etc.) I still have grown up enough to deal with sadness in other ways. Stupid taylor. I mean I know what he was feeling, last week I had a little breakdown of sorts myself. I just needed to talk to him, but the thing was, he wasnt there for me. I tried so hard to be there for him, console him, etc. but it seemed as if he didn't want me to try to help or reassure him of my love, so im not sure what to do. I'm kind of pissed off about he's handled this being away thing. Not calling really, not being very considerate, etc. I do love him, but I guess this is one of the reasons it's good we're breaking up next year. Maybe someday I'll find someone who really treats me like a goddess. I'm so shallow because I basically want a guy like Jon Woodside, but one who's more attractive. He 's so good to me, but he's justnot my type physically, so i guess that's the way it goes. Tay is fun, but he's definitely not my dream guy. He's hot, he's fun, and he can be sweet, but he doesn't sweep me off my feet. He doesn't make me feel like I'm a queen. He does do some nice things sometimes.... and sometimes he compliments me.... but I always feel like Im being judged. And when I ask if he thinks I'm pretty and he says "well, i think you could use a diet." then I feel pretty bad abouit myself. I suppose I should, he is telling the truth, but still, I do wish he didn't think that. I wish he just thought I was beautiful how I am. Oh well though, whatever. Other things are kinda getting to me lately too. I'm not close with anyone really (besides him), my acting career is at a standstill, SLOTH is dead, Selfism is dead, etc. Even the things I used to do like keeping a journal I can't do now because of what happened with my mom. The person I used to be is slowly dying it seems and it upsets me. So what do I do? Rebel against everything and just try to start over? But the thing is, sometimes I am happy, I just wish it was more often. bah, perhaps I'll write again soon. At least this is somewhere my mom and people I know can never find.

       (This was copied from another online journal I had last year. I wanted to consolidate.)   Today was the last day of summer school. I took health 2 to get it out of the way for next year. I think I must be retarded or something, I got an A-!!! How is it possiblenot to get an A+ in Health!!!!????? Wow I am reallyreally dumb. Oh well, so it goes. I sent Tay another letter today. I hope he likes my letters. I'm still confused on the whole "do I Love him" subject. I just want to talk to him, especially after the letter I sent to him telling him how I'm feeling. There's still more we need to talk about too when he gets home. I wonder if he thinks I'm complicating things and making them into a much bigger deal than they actually are. I like this because I can ramble and there is no reason not to, because hey, no one will ever read it. I think I'm going to confess all my thoughts on here. Not like the poeple who it's about will see, right? Exactly.   I am going to start an online comic. I've decided. My favorite comics are Penny Arcade and Road Waffles, so I'm going to be a big poser and create my own (prolly with my best friend Nicole). Be on the look out for some thing cool from yours truly. Then again, this might just become another of my projects that I talk about but never do (like becoming a rockstar, taking over the world, etc...), but I'm hoping I'll actually follow through with this.I'm supposed to spend time with my dad this afternoon so I'm wishing for the best. He is the Nazi King. I hate him. Oh well, so it goes. Whatever. Then tonight I'm prolly going to my friend Emily's house, so that's good at least. She just got diagnosed as bipolar so I'm kinda worried she's gonna spend all night complainging to me about it and how much it sucks. It does, I agree, but gras. Ok, it's father/nazi time now, later kids (I Love how I act like I'm really talking to someone).

      We broke up. Wow... Over 1 year 3 months.... all over.  Perhaps I'll explain more later? For now here's the condensed version: After seeing him last night; him being stoned and pissy, I really was at the end of my rope. I told him we just needed to talk because I was done chasing after him, etc. Don't know how much he remembered, but tonight he called me as he promised he would. We both said that we werent happy, he said he isn't still in love with me, i thought we should maybe take a break but first see eachother to decide, he didnt want to see me- he said he didnt want to make it work out, so it was decided we would be single as of tonight. I called Nicole and cried. We're supposed to see eachother soon to just see how things are. He's under the impression that we're gonna still hookup and things will be the same pretty much. How very wrong. I'll try just being friends, but he claimed that he's unhappy when with me, so how could hanging out work anyways? He's always so fickle and uncertain... I never know. We will see I suppose, but a couple things: Thanks to my friends for being there, thanks to Abby Marsh for endowing me with wisdom, and thank you Muse for conveniently adding a soundtrack to my life.   I don't think it's really sunk in yet. I'm SINGLE. I donno, all too surreal. I'm not sad yet. Though I know I will be on my birthday. Oh well... I guess so it goes. And THIS is why I keep up my guard with people... So Taylor, Goodbye. I hope you have fun fucking Elise or Ellie or Christina or anyone else you like, and yes, let's try to be friends, but I will not take shit from you ever again... and this will not destroy me. Hm, one would think I would've drawn something like this:  But no, I drew my character in Sloth, like this:  Very strange.

      Ok, need to catch up. Saw taylor, gave him the sweatshirt. That was a couple days ago but i need to update. When i arrived (11 am) he was already drunk and looked very different than i had remembered (long black hair, scraggly blond goatee growing, heh). it was weird. I tried to talk to him but he was drunk and insisted I drink too, so i did, and we fooled around and then fell asleep together until it was time for me to leave. Weird stuff. He's seriously turning into an alcoholic- ick. The next day I had plans with jon woodside, which was nice, and he helped me set up for the party and we also went to part of a play (we got lost on the way there and home). It was nice but I always felt like he wasnt having fun or something. nicole and colin came out to lead us home and nicole showed me the ring colin gave her- a promise ring. it's a claddagh ring (her favorite) with an emerald in the heart and diamonds on the sides. GORGEOUS!! But it made me sad realizing taylor would never do something like that for me... i mean tay and i arent sure if we're really dating... how could he love me enough to do something like that for me. Gah. Oh well. I need to find a guy who'll do that for me. Buy me some crazy ring like this...   Not that it's the money- but the fact that they'd buy something that gorgeous and priceless and beautiful for me.... just wow. I just hope someday I'll find that kind of overwhelming love. Also, i feel bad that i dont return jon's love in the same way. this was his profile after we hung out:  "Being lost in a car for whatever amount of time is not bad at all if you're with the right person, and so long as you make lefts. The play was good, but not all of my focus was on it. I more enjoyed the buildings.And when she walked in the "Fire Lane" I couldn't help but agree. I wish she could be relaxed though. I'm always entertained, and every minute with her is nothing but beauty. Speaking of beauty, did you ever see a beautiful red-haired girl glowing in red light? The tank top, the hair falling down so simply and cute,and the smile after a growl escapes her throat that confirms insanity; You're crazy about her...."  I mean that's so sweet and stuff but he's not who i wish thought those things about me... which is unfortunate, for both of us. The party happened the 14th and was a lot of fun. Here's who all came: Emily Bryant, Emily adelstien, Adam yasinow, Catherine Kachurek, Jita fumich, Sean Fitzgerald, Nicole pursell, Brendan tucker, Sarah blair, Kat white, Peter hedman, Claire oppenhiem, Carly Hoffman, Rob rodems, Avey venable, Elise O, J McNamara, Heather Wilson, Hannah ewert-krocker, Colin boyle, Eugene Kozlenko, Erin Bell, Chelsea Nicol, Annie + Sam, Taylor shockey, Pat whitlow. Some great gifts included an AMAZING dress from Nicole, condoms from Erin, and a dvd of almost porn from emily, plus more. Good times. Tay and I had fun i think, though he got mad at me part way through and there was some drama with nicole + parents. But then after people left Taylor, avey, and emily slept over, which was fun. We went in the hot tub and went out in the field and watched the stars (saw shooting stars- incredible!!), and it was a good night. Tay and I had an interesting incident with Avey in my bed and he's always hoping for a girl girl threesome. Which im just always unsure about- obviously with avey cuz she's my friend, but also becvause i dont want to watch him do stuff with another girl. Maybe im weird or soemthing but really. And im not bi- i dont think, so it'd be no fun for me either. But we had fun later in the night then too so that was fun. We talked about the future of us... and whether there is one. He says he doesnt know... he says he'll always love me, and even if we break up we'll still hang out and be friends and maybe hookup, but NO WAY. bah, what a jerk. i cried... i hate doing that. I hate showing him how much he can hurt me, and how much he really does mean to me, but of course, i did. BUt he was tired so that was the end of that. Who knows what'll happen now. Maybe I'll see him tomorrow after spending time with avey on her birthday (hoorah! 15!!) Also I just wish i could have a relationship with him that even came close to his with Elise. Grr, that makes me so mad, I wish he'd just fuck her already and get it out of his system... maybe he'd love me again then?  Anyways, now to the sexuality thing... but I warn you- personal stuff here so it may be in your best interest not to read (Hah! Like there are readers!!). I don't want to do stuff with girls- I find vaginas pretty gross. However, I find girls really hot. Only two things actually turn me on. (Other things i can be like "ooh" or what not, but only two things get me in the mood seriously). They are: #1. reading certain things- like notproud.com, lustful stupid stuff is so hot... wow... i know it's childish, but that dirty stuff is so hot, or just stuff that makes me think of dirty stuff- like reading clockwork orange- mmm! #2. Certain pictures of girls. I like fake porn. I dont want girls doing stuff with guys, or girls with girls, or even girls doing stuff to themselves.... but just really suggestive pictures of girls I find SOOOOO SEXY. Like victoria secret catalogs are golden... and like this pic is amazing:   So what they hell!? I mean, sometimes I think it'd be fun just to try doing stuff with a girl, and like ive had a bunch of dreams where i do stuff with girls, but i would never want to date one. I could never lust after a vagina (not that i ever lust after penis though either...), but i dont know. Girls in lingerie and stuff is my thing i guess. Bah... i've sorta talked to nicole and some people about this... but i dont really want to discuss it cuz i think it'd either weird them out, or, they'd think I'm just trying to become bi because everyone else is! But really, im not, i dont like girls, they just turn me on! Gah... weird times.... but when arent they? I'll update again when I can.... so for now non-existant readers- so long so long.

      Here is the LOW-down. So, I hung out with Nicole and Avey, which was really nice. I was kinda hesitant at first because I was worried things would eb weird with Nicole and me, but they weren't. It's like we can always pick up where we left off, which i'm really happy about. I donno, her and I just have a couple issues, like the whole competing thing. I don't mean to, and i dont think she means to either, but we do. And I thought avey would be another competition (because at times it does seem that way), but it wasn't. We had a good time and I was happy. I ran into Christian with Avey on Coventry and it was kinda awkward. He's so feminine and emo now. He was there with his girlfriend Alison, and i always get jealous of her, even though he's not my type anymore. But he is still cute. Oh well, so it goes. Spent time just with Avey, which was nice, and then later that night I spent a lot of time just talking and walking with Nicole. That was really nice. We covered things like boys, sexuality in general, and friends. Good times getting lost in Shaker/Cl. Heights at 1 am. Anyways, I was supposed to see taylor, but it didn't work. The next day i was going to see him but he didnt want me to come, so whatever. But he was just such a jerk. I talked to pat whitlow to figure stuff out and he said he talked to tay and here is supposidly what's going on: Tay came to the realization at camp that there are a ton of other girls out there, and should he really date the same girl for all of high school? Well... back to that... AGAIN. UGH! We were supposed to see eachother today but he blew me off (I was SOOOOO ANGRY), but i'm going to his house tomorrow morning. I hope it goes well. And if not, at least then I can make up my mind to move on. I mean there are other guys out there. Like Midsummer Night's dream boy (oh i hope he's in the play), and MJ started hitting on me tonight (ick), and jon (of course). Jon really is the sweetest guy. Here are parts of his conversation from tonight!  Earthen Herald: I just see you, something magnificent and colorful standing out in this gray world, and i feel like paying attnetion to anyone else would be like playing with a stik at the beach, with my back turned and missing the breath taking sunset . It seems like people are looking through telescopes and seeing further, but missing whats right in front of them; whist i look through a kaliedescope, and see only one thing, but that one thing is too beautiful for words.  who's to say who's getting the most? If i sat for hours, i couldn't put this stuff on paper but all i have to do is think about you...You bring out the best in me, what can I say.   Ah! You see? I don't deserve that at all. He doesn't think tay deserves me... i wish he was right. Also, today (the 11th) was my mom's birthday.    (One thing I made for her). I also gave her a bunch of cd's I burnt at Avey's house. Wow, she realllly bailed me out there. All these people are too good to me... Need to repay them! But how? Gras...I'm nervous about tomorrow. His sweatshirt isn't finished, I should be sewing... but I had to journal. Ok, I'm out.

      Bah. I should've updated sooner, but I've been kind of busy. Yesterday was a really bad day for me. The first horrible thing was my little kitten, Pantalaimon suddenly was dying. We don't know what happened to him or anything, maybe he was poisoned from eating/drinking something? No one knows. Anyways, it was bad times holding him in my arms in the car on the way to the animal emergency hospital, crying and rubbing him, trying to make him stay alive. But in the end, nothing worked, and he died. So it goes. It was really sad though because I spent sooo much time with that cat, and he really meant a lot to me.    So I was upset and called Taylor. Of course he didn't answer because he never does. I was sad a lot that day, so tried him again that night to just talk. He was an asshole and wasn't comforting at all. He frankly didn't care. And he was honest when he told me: "you know what, im gonna go, im really tired. No... that was a lie. I'm not tired, im just bored." So wonderful, he's bored talking to me. So I asked: "Do you even still like me?" Tay: "I don't know. I think so. I haven't seen you for a while.... I  just don't know." Me: "I guess not." It led into other things... like him thinking we both have changed, things are awkward between us, etc.  Fanfuckingtastic!!  exactly when I need to be brought down even more, whoa, there's taylor (as usual), to make me feel like shit! Wonderful timing Sir! So, as a tribute, here's my buddy icon:   The cartoon is funnier though. But, when I was sobbing and upset last night, thinking life is worthless, who do I talk to, but Jon Woodside! Seriously, that guy is like my guardien angel. He just says the most incredible things to me, and i needed it so much. I dont think i can ever repay him for how supportive he's always been, but I hope he knows how much he means to me.  Also, after listening to Muse (wow, they are godly) on repeat during this whole thing, (compliments of: http://www.bandbuilder.com/muse/index.php?ref_code=D52238), and being inspired by Jon, I made a new things to do list. One of the things on there is to dump taylor if he does not start treating me better by my birthday. So that's like two weeks... good luck taylor! I suggest being sweet or you may miss out on some fun stuff... because i have gotten pretty damn experienced dating that kid, not to be cocky (heh heh, i made a pun). But seriously, if things don't work out with him, I'm just going to seize the opportunity and say "fuck it!" and go do stuff ive been wanting to do for a while... i.e. the kid from CVLT, a couple college kids, and even some random people like adam klauss (God, reading Clockwork orange makes me want him, except it's purely lust). I guess we'll see what happens. I mean I love tay, so that's my first priority, but hey, if that falls through and i wind up with purely the lust side, is it really so bad!? Well, he gets home tomorrow, and i'm just anxious about it. I know he's gonna be disappointed with how I look (i didnt lose weight like he wanted), but i'm gonna try not to care! I need to start detaching myself from him! Good plan!  Anyways, we got 3 new kittens today! Yay! The little boy (mine) is asleep on my lap right now and I love him! Yay! Also, I went to 3 auditions today. Think any of them will follow through? I don't, but hey- who knows!?

      Survey thing about my "perfect guy." So here are my answers. Then I went through and looked at what things Taylor fits. If he fits my ideal guy for a category, I'll  put the text  in red.    Hair color?: Black Eye color?: Blue  Height?: 6’    Muscles: Yes Long hair or short?: Shaggy hair Glasses?: no  Piercings?: yes Clothing: Punky    Big butt or little?:little Chest hair?:No Buff or skinny?:skinny Teeth?:Nice teeth Funny or serious?: both Party-hopper or more stay-at-home?: both Should he be able to bake or cook?:No Does he have a best friend?:sure Is it okay for him to have a lot of female friends?: depends, but yes  Out-going or shy?:out-going usually Sarcastic or sincere?:Both but more sincere Does he love his mother?:To an extent Should he watch chick-flicks?:with me    Would he be a smoker?:No way  How about a drinking?:Only with me    And swearing?:Only sometimes  Would he play with your hair?:definitely    Would he have more than one girlfriend at a time?:NO  Would he pay for you when you're on a date?:occasionally   Does he kiss on the first date?:yes Where would you go for dinner?:somewhere nice   Would he buy you flowers?:yes Would he lay under the stars with you and spout about random philosophies?:Yes sir! Would he write poetry about you?:yes yes Would he use endearments?:sometimes    Would he hang out with you and YOUR friends?:Yes How about you hanging out with him and HIS friends?:Yes  Would he walk you up to the door at the end of the evening?:yes Would you hold hands?:Yes What sports would he play?: Soccer    Would he skateboard?:Yes! Snowboard?:Yes  Can he sing?:Definitely    Play the guitar?:YES Play piano?:Yes Play the drums?:Yes  Can he keep his room clean?:Sometimes    Is he an artist of sorts?:Yes  Does he write songs for you?:YES    Does he have pets?:Yes  Does he watch the sun rise and set with you?:YES What kind of car does he drive?:Something decently nice    How old is he?:older than me  What's his name?:Oliver     So, that's about half I'd say, maybe a little over that he fits. But I do love him... I just wish he seemed like he loved me once in a while... it's mostly the romantic stuff that he doesn't fit on this survey afterall. But oh well.   I got my headshots back today! Hooray, some came out well. One more step on my path to becoming a real actress.  Here's my favorite as of right now:   I'm excited about my acting career... I am really going to try to work on it and go places. Tonight I tried out for A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Chagrin Valley Little Theater, and although it's just a community theater, I wanted to try doing shakespeare. So I went, read some scenes, turned some heads (yay!), and it was fun. There was this guy there, who was so cute, and decently talented, and kept talking to me/looking at me, and offered me a ride home! And he was really hot. Damn... I hope I get to see more of him! (After the audition also the director came outside and said to me that I did a "tremendous job," that I "have a beautiful voice" and "a great understanding of the characters." She also said that I will definitely be getting a call from her this weekend, meaning I'm definitely in! Yay! Now it's just a matter of what part! I think I'm going to have fun with this. In the Taylor department... He's just always such a jerk! Gras! But maybe things will be different when he's home? We'll see... And hey- there's always hot actor boy? Hah, I'm kidding, my heart is taylor's.... as long as he is nice again when he gets home!

      So, I spent last night at Maddie's house after I did the church performance thing (which went decently...). It was fun hanging with her- I'll miss her a lot next year. She's one of the only people I know that I can just sit with and talk to for hours and never get bored. We can even do separate things and still just enjoy eachother's company. It's nice. Anyways, one of the things we talked about was the issue of "doing stuff" and tricks/tips, etc. We exchanged some advice (I told her a lot of kinkier ideas because i've researched + experimented a fair amount) and there are a couple things that she said that i need to remember... plus some things that I told her, that I just need to do again.  - When kissing him, use my tongue to do an upward flick/movement in his mouth (like a "come here" motion). - If my head is tilted enough, use my tongue to outline the inside of his mouth between his teeth and lips (apparently makes guys think of sex). - Suprise him again (haven't done it for a while). After he leaves the room for something and comes back, go crazy. - Buy lingerie!!    (examples of what I want!) - Request things (pretend to want things, if only to make him feel good about himself). - Come up behind him quietly and just start seducing him without him knowing I'm coming until I'm there. - Go skinny dipping!!  Well, those are some of the main ones, so I'll make sure to try/repeat those.   As far as Taylor and I are though right now... I'm really not sure. Like we're still dating and stuff... but things have been pretty bad between us (with the phone calls and stuff) while he's been gone. I just hope that when he gets home things will be like they used to be. I miss how they were and I miss being happy together with him. Well, we'll see. Also... today's my brother's birthday. Happy birthday Rich!
