      All people are jackasses to some extent.  Only a few jackasses know that they are.  Jackasses hiding in earth covered holes who never see the light of day who live in a  chosen  oblivion know that they are jackasses.  I have a soft spot for these types. They seem to have the most poetry.  Jackasses involved in endless attempts at approval who bask in the public sun who take the exterior world for reality who live in a blindly ambitious way don't know they are jackasses.  I have no recourse for that jackass. probably because they lack that element of poetry.  So it would seem that to knowing the innards of things is poetry even if it does make you run and hide, it is closer to reality realism is poetry. As for ambition, it is the security blanket in a fool's paradise.

      i'm a person who constantly tries to bring under cultivation that which gets me looming toward a feeling of purpose. in other words, if i'm jazzed by an undertaking in this life, it becomes my project. on the rare occasion that i'm actually that enthused, i take it as an opportunity to reclaim some shred of humanity i feel i've lost; to make up for a vice or a wasted condition. only those things that require both truth and style to be done well, get me to that place.  well anyway, writing is one of those things for me. This is not to say that everything i write bears truth and style. In fact, a lot of what i write is crap but i try. this blog spot has become my cultivation center. i invite you to help me along in the process.  since writing is my reclamation project lately, i excercise this opportunity with great emotional responsibility. in my opinion, there are only a few things in life worth this kind of attention.  most other things are either a waste of time or a means to an end.  because writing helps me to be more human ( even if humanity is overrated). because i don't write when i don't want to (see, i'm not overly protective of my projects ). because i don't attempt it unless it runs out of me. because i want to be a better writer. because i do it with the intent of truth and style. because you, the reader could find something new to like or dislike. for all of these reasons, you should read what i write.  -Devon Waters
