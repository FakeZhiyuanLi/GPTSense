        Missing persons    I just don’t understand the motivation behind the national media and general public’s absolute insane obsession with a select few missing persons stories that monopolize the headlines each year. I guess my problem is with the apparent propensity of the press to single out a few very young and/or photogenic individuals—usually female (and most recently pregnant)--for attention and publication. At the same time, in the same and other regions of the country, a multitude of other less popular, less photogenic, or socially un-acceptable persons’ plight go un-noticed and un-published.  Once a given missing-person story hits the newspapers and the airwaves, the press micro-reports each and every nuance of speculation and gory detail and, when and if the facts move the story toward the suspicion of murder or other foul play, the developing epic saga is then locked on the front pages of newspapers and in the lead position on the cable TV pseudo-news-talk-shows for what seems an eternity. We are finally relieved of the burden of concern and obligatory angst when the body is found, a suspect is captured, and the jury delivers a verdict-- sometimes many years later.  Here’s a reality check for you. Each year there are nearly 900,000 persons reported missing and entered into the FBI database. Over two-thirds of these individuals are minor children. While many of these cases are often successfully resolved in a matter of days as runaways or as mistakes, as of March 2003, there were nearly 100,000 active missing person cases:  urlLink http://fomlo.homestead.com/statistics.html  . I expect that more recent data will show similar results when it is made available.  It is my assertion that the excessive attention and the resulting sensationalism of these high profile cases act as a sort of media produced “junk food for the mind,” serving to divert our attention away from many much more important issues in life. Why let your mind be distracted and dulled with these overtly sensationalistic media soap operas?  Don’t get me wrong here, I have a great deal of sympathy for each and every one of the victims and their families, but enough is enough on any given circumstance. If you honestly want to worry about missing persons, why not volunteer to help in a case in your local area that is not receiving a high degree of media attention? Actually load up in your SUV with your hiking boots and bandanna and personally, physically help in the search effort. Or, how about supporting a local missing person’s search effort in your area with the provision of logistical services like food and water delivery or by helping man (or woman) a phone bank for information and tips?  What ever you do, don’t just sit on your rear end, vegetating in front of the TV and pontificating about the sentence the perpetrator should receive.     Voters Rights (and Wrongs)          I can’t count the number of spirited (and often mind numbing) conversations I have had recently with ill informed, venom spewing, so-called US citizens who completely disagree with me on everything from minor social issues to major topics affecting our national defense.  After reaching an impasse philosophically, it is frightening how many of these mental giants resort to name calling and insults—unable to offer a rational defense of their position on any given issue. They've heard and they feel, but they don’t think.  The final absurdity usually occurs when my adversary ends the conversation by admitting that they are either not registered to vote or have not voted in years. Say what?  At the risk of canceling my vote and those of my intellectual superiors throughout this great nation, how about registering to vote? Then spend your time reading and otherwise educating yourself in preparation for the local and national elections to be held this November. Lacey Peterson and Lori Hacking would probably have appreciated your efforts.     Dead Celebrities    Blaa, Blaa, Blaa - more later...     Olympic Sized Ego’s and Overpaid Professional Athletes    What’s more important—talent or teamwork? By the looks of the makeup and performance of the current US men’s basketball team, talent is not the answer.  Not that anyone ever asked me, but I have never cottoned much to the idea of allowing professional athletes to form the core of an Olympic team. I know, I know, I know, the Soviet Union used to stack their deck with the equivalent of professional hockey players and professional basketball players in the 1970’s and 1980’s while we were still playing great college seniors from Duke and Georgetown. But, when the rules changed (in 1992, I think,) I somehow knew in the back of my mind that this remedy would most likely accelerate the downfall of the US Olympic basketball effort. I think that the performance to date of this year’s men’s team represents the fruition of my somewhat audacious prediction.  This current bunch of ego-maniacs which we call “The Dream Team” is, in my opinion, more like a “Nightmare on Main Street,” and it is currently well on its way to embarrassing Dr. Naismith (basketball’s inventor,) the team members individually, and the monstrosity of a professional sports program we lovingly (not!) refer to as the National Basketball Association.  There are twelve NBA players that make up the Men’s US Olympic Basketball team. A little research on the Web reveals that the 2003-2004 salary of the top three players equals $39,676,125.00. Players whose salaries could be identified include:  Allen Iverson $13,500,000.00* Stephon Marbury $13,500,000.00* Tim Duncan $12,676,125.00* Lamar Odom $3,557,585.00** Shawn Marion $2,265,375.00** Amare Stoudemire $1,767,120.00** Richard Jefferson $1,482,840.00** Total $48,749,045.00  *2003-2004 season **2002-2003 season source:  urlLink http://www.insidehoops.com/nbasalaries.shtml   I’d hazard to guess that the 2002-2003 salaries of four players has increased and that the salary of the other five players not included (Carmelo Anthony, Carlos Boozer, LeBron James, Emeka Okafor, Dwyane Wade) has to equal at least another $7M to $10M, especially since LeBron James signed a three year, $12.96M contract straight out of high school last season.  Fifty Five Million Dollars, earned among twelve guys, who can’t even sweep all of their games in a so called amateur event we still laughingly call the Olympics. I guess my point is, if money isn't enough of a motivation for these professionals to put out a quality performance each week during the regular NBA season (attendance is declining in many US cities,) why would a $500 gold metal make any difference?  When will we learn? Why don’t we change? Just wondering…

      Finally, detailed news reports from south Florida are coming out as the media is allowed access to the areas most affected by Hurricane Charley. Among the heartbreaking stories of death, injury, and loss of property, are amazing tales of miracles and of survival. For instance, did anyone see the story on the Weather Channel about the large aquarium found intact, filled with water and fish, still standing upright on the second floor of a demolished house?  All of the political pundits have had their say about when and if President Bush should have visited the damaged areas and how much the visit would affect his political stock. And of course there is also the latest round of expressions of outrage from the politicians, media, and bleeding heart liberals decrying tactics of “price gouging.” Governor Bush and the Florida Attorney General are even threatening the arrest and prosecution of anyone caught “price Gouging.”  I must admit that my position on price gouging has changed 180 degrees over the past 20 years as my political and ideological beliefs changed from those based on feelings and emotion to beliefs based on facts and logic. I know you left wingers out there are going to have your head spinning around as I attempt to address this topic, so, in an attempt to be “fair and balanced” (sorry FOX news) I’ll just go ahead and express your description of me—how about “insensitive” and “selfish” or even “ignorant” and “stupid?”  Any way, let’s look at pricing policies in a free market economy. Take hotels, for instance. In most states, hotels are required by law to publicly publish the minimum and maximum prices (usually located on the back of the room door) that they can legally charge for a given room. For instance, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina I have paid $49 per night in cold, rainy January for an ocean view two-room suite with a hot tub. At that time of the year the overnight hotel occupants were a few retired couples, the front desk clerk, and myself. This same room, according to the room rate card, would rent for $250 per night in July.  In New Orleans, in February, before Mardi Gras, I’ve rented a room on Dauphine Street, one block off of Bourbon Street, for $79 per night. I also have had to reserve that same room an entire year in advance in order to have it for the four evenings preceding Fat Tuesday and at that time it cost me $300 per night. Likewise, in Panama City Beach, Florida I’ve rented an oceanfront room on New Years Eve for $99 per night that rents for $275 per night in July.  What is the determining factor in the room pricing? D-E-M-A-N-D! Can I hire the media and a politician or two to go down to Myrtle Beach with me on the 4th of July and share my outrage and threaten to arrest the hotel owner because he won’t allow me to rent a two-room suite with a hot tub for $49? Or maybe the Mayor of New Orleans and the editor of the Times-Picayune will support my case for getting a $79 per night room on Bourbon Street for a few nights before Fat Tuesday.  Real estate, tickets to sporting events, concert tickets, beach towels, bathing suits—you name it, seasonal/situational demand and availability are the determining factors in setting the market price of a given commodity.  So now let’s change the product and the circumstances with another example. Suppose I live in Atlanta and run a moving company. Business is slow, it’s the middle of the month, and a hurricane hits south Florida. Seeing a business opportunity, I decide to take a dozen of my trucks, borrow a quarter million dollars, and put fifty thousand of my own money up to finance the purchase of plywood, tarps, chain saws, and generators. I buy $15,000 worth of fuel to fill up the tanks on the trucks, and then I pay a couple dozen of my employees to drive my trucks and me from Atlanta down to ground zero at Port Charlotte, Florida. I also buy insurance on my inventory, I pay my employees salary and per diem, and I buy a local business license in every location in which I intend to operate. Everything is legal and on the up-and-up.  Upon arrival in Florida, I secure a place to park my trucks and I put my entire inventory up for sale—at prices equaling three to five times what I paid for it. That ten-dollar tarp now will cost you fifty dollars. That $250 chain saw now costs nine hundred dollars. A $15 sheet of plywood is $50 and a $350 generator is $1250. By the way, the local Home Depot and Ace Hardware had their roofs blown off and have sold out of undamaged chain saws and generators. Boy will everyone be glad to see us, right?  Wrong--you balding, arrogant, white libertarian. “Price gouging” cries the press. “We’ll arrest you and sue,” cry the politicians. “Why,” I ask? What am I doing in my pricing policies that aren’t equal to the pricing policies set by the hotel operators, sports arenas, and retailers? No one is holding a gun to your head to make you pay my price, are they?  If my products weren't made available by my efforts and expenses, there would be no products to buy.  As I stated earlier, price, in a free market economy, is set by product availability and product demand. It’s just that simple.  Yes, if I were the Red Cross or just a charitably minded individual I could sell these items at cost or even give them away. And I might just choose to share my profits by donating a few units of each product to truly needy individuals. But the truth is, I’ve personally had a hard year, business has been slow, and I need to make some real money to catch up on my own bills and keep my family fed. Let the churches and FEMA take care of the needy.  Beyond the emotional, kneejerk reaction of villifying making a profit off of disaster victims, here is the underlying topic that no one wants to talk about—an issue that permeates much of our society here in the United States. Almost every single one of these poor, damaged, displaced, wounded individuals and families made a conscious decision to live in a coastal region where they knew they were potentially subject to the winds and flooding related to hurricanes and tropical storms. They could have lived and worked further inland, bought a retirement home in a state other than Florida, or whatever. Then upon buying a home, they could have looked into the new building codes and made modifications and improvements in order to meet the increased standards.  In addition, almost every single family had months, if not years, of opportunity to prepare for the potential aftermath of a storm by buying a small chain saw, an appropriately sized generator, and a half dozen tarps at a total cost of not more than $1,500. This prudent investment in emergency equipment could have been stored, along with their other emergency supplies (canned food, bottled water, first aid kit, radio, flashlight, batteries, etc.,) in their home and packed with them in their vehicle when and if they evacuated the area.  Unfortunately, in many cases, these individuals and families choose to not purchase these items, as they often also CHOOSE to not purchase adequate health insurance, flood insurance (government subsidized—by the way), life insurance, and other of life's essential "non-essentials." New cars, expensive tennis shoes, and Disney vacations all took priority over disaster preparation. In essence, they “gambled” on not needing these necessary "necessities" and they lost, big time. Now they find themselves paying the current real cost of these items, based on the current real market value and they are looking for someone else to blame.  The sad thing is that many, if not most, of them will make the same mistake again. And even worst, many others will follow their plight in the media and will not learn a single thing from their tragedy. Wake up people!

      Two hurricanes in one week (well, actually one hurricane and one tropical storm) certainly is a good formula to take your mind off of a number of life's frivolous distractions--particularly if you live on or near the coast of the Southeastern US during the summer months.  Don't you just love the gleam a good 145 MPH wind puts in the eyes of the local TV weather nerds and the gloating staff of "The Weather Channel?" I personally prefer a good weather news story a great deal more than I like following the sexual antics and mis-behaviors of some overpaid athlete and their remorseful female conquest or the endless saga of some poor, photogenic wife whom has paid the ultimate price as the victim of her bad life partner choice.  The present movement of Hurricane Charley is of particular interest to me and my neighbors as it slides across the Florida pennesula this evening toward our homes on St. Simons Island, Georgia. Current local forecasts are for winds only in the fifty to seventy MPH range. The minor storm surge is probably our biggest concern here as most of the island is two feet below the government's so called flood plain and there is only one low lying road connecting the island to the mainland.  Having been a coastal resident since only this past March, I find myself in the early stages of learning the habits and behaviors that will allow me to successfully negotiate the intricacies of storm preparation and, God forbid, evacuation in advance of an approaching storm. I've found that many other longer time residents are in the same boat (excuse the pun.)  You see, the Georgia coast enjoys the distinction of rarely bearing the brunt of tropical weather of the type and severity that Florida and North Carolina does each year. We are, however, tittillatted every three or four years with the possibility of the strike of a bona-fide doosie of a storm. It seems that I have arrived back home from a vacation in Chicago today just in time for such an event.  The thing that is most striking to me thus far is the reality that many if not most people absolutely loose their blankin' minds upon even the hint of the approach of a major storm. For instance, I made a trip to the grocery store this afternoon to pick up a few last minute items--having spent several weeks out of town and arriving with the storm possibly only a half-day away.  The first sign of trouble was that the grocery lot was virtually full of autos and SUV's upon my arrival. The next obvious clue was the availablilty of only three shopping carts inside the front door of the store. The place was an absolute madhouse filled with wildeyed senior citizens and soccer moms who were careening wildly up and down the isles, their carts each filled with bales of toilet paper, paper towels, bottled water, and on most occasions--TWO OR THREE LOAVES of bread. The biggest personal blow was that the Peter Pan peanut butter was sold out entirely  (I had to buy Jiff.)  Now I ask you, what makes normally rational people believe that they are actually going to go through two or three jars of peanut butter and three loaves of bread in the one or two days that a storm this size and path could cut us off from civilization? If they do eat all of that peanut butter, they will be so stopped up they could never possibly use an entire case of toilet paper, could they?  In an effort to document my current experiences and assist any future coastal residents in the art of Hurricane preparedness, I would like to offer my own list of Do's and Don'ts:   Do  listen to local weather broadcasts every few hours in order to stay up to date on the storm's location, forecast storm track, and any evacuation orders that may be issued.   Don't  go to the local bar hours before the storm roars into your neighborhood and get shitfaced drinking kamikaze shots or a half dozen long island ice teas before heading home to tackle hanging that truck load of plywood you just bought at Home Depot over your windows and doors.   Do  put together a basic hurricane supply kit including drinking water, prescription medicines, first aid kit,  canned foods, flashlight and spare batteries, battery powered radio, etc.   Don't  think that you're prepared when your hurricane kit simply includes a twelve-pack of warm beer, a fifth of tequilla, a couple of half burned candles from the last storm warning , an old Bic lighter, and an inflatable raft with one broken oar.   Do  gas up the car or SUV and move it to high ground prior to the local roads being closed.   Don't  venture out durring the storm onto flooded roads in high winds at break kneck speeds in an attempt to recreate Lt. Dan's hurricane scene in the movie "Forrest Gump."   Do  move your boat onto it's trailer and secure it in a safe storage area.  Relocate larger boats away from docks, pileings, and other boats and double/triple anchor them in place.   Don't  think you are going to weather out the storm on board your boat with your warm twelve-pack and fifth of tequilla.  (You will end up dead or be seen on CNN by all of your friends and family--you'll be the one hanging by a cable underneath a Coast Guard helicopter.)   Got to go outside to check out the weather again  Charley's back offshore in the Atlantic and the eye is tightening up again, more later...

      As Television became a part of most every family's life in the 1960's, so were the political realities of issues like race relations and international politics brought home to our living rooms each and every evening.  Where in the 1940's and 1950's you had to read the newspaper or go to the local movie house to see news reels before each film or during intermission, the Network evening news and cable/satellite television now brings the gory details of worldwide tragedy's into your personal space in suburbia for your individual enjoyment or horror.  With the opening of the $7.34 billion edition of the modern Olympic Games, the current terror threat level and the multi-billion dollar security (that's Billion with a B) reminds me of some historical lessons that we could all probably learn from:  For instance, Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay) wins the gold medal in the 1964 Olympics, refuses to be drafted and go to Vietnam, and changes his name to that of a member of that peaceful religion called Islam:   urlLink http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Ali_Muhammad.html   Then Palestinian Arab "Terrorists" (lead by a young, future Nobel Peace Prize winner--Yasser Arafat) slip into the 1972 Munich Olympic Village and hold hostage and massacre Israeli athletes:   urlLink http://www.wftv.com/news/3643877/detail.html   Another future Nobel Peace Prize winner--one term President Jimmy (smile when you say that) Carter boycotts the 1980 Olympic games because the Soviets invaded Afghanistan...say what???   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/20/spotlight/   Then Richard Jewell took the initial heat for the bombing at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta:   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/US/9701/03/olympic.bombing/   So what spine tingling excitement will the current events in Athens (Greece, thank God, not Athens, Georgia...home of UGA) hold for us over the next few weeks???   urlLink http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=597&u=/nm/20040812/tv_nm/olympics_dc_37&amp;printer=1   We're flying back from Chicago to the Georgia coast for the arrival of Hurricane Charley tomorrow--wish us luck.  Keep watching, listening, and learning, Ya'll...

      I enjoy watching an occasional NASCAR race. I’ve followed the sport of stock car racin' since I was a kid in the 1960’s, when it was still in its infancy (by today’s standards,) and guys like Bobby Allison and Richard Petty drove cars that were actually built on the same assembly line beside the ones that parked in your neighbors’ driveway.  The race cars also actually looked like the vehicles in the dealers’ showrooms—except for the 600 horsepower engine under the real steel hood, the roll bars, the lack of a back seat, the STP & Hooker header stickers on the fenders, and the big numbers plastered on the doors and the roof. Come to think of it some of our neighbors in south Alabama had all the stickers and the roll bars and no back seat. I guess you had to be there to understand.  There was little TV exposure in those days except regionally for the really big races like Daytona and Talladega—the Indy 500 was the only race of any kind regularly televised nationally back then. If you got north of or west of Tennessee and hooted and hollered and yelled the number “Three” in public, no one knew what on earth you were talking about let alone would be willing to fight you over whether Dale Earnhart or one of the Allisons was the better driver.  Today things are quite different. Total strangers will beat your Grandma if she happens to ‘dis their driver in public. From New Hampshire to California, from Michigan to Homestead Florida, people are fighting in traffic and willingly paying seventy five or more dollars to attend NASCAR races--events that represent probably the most commercialized 6 hours they will endure in a lifetime, with the singular possible exception of Christmas each year.  What really gets me is the TV interviews they do with the drivers and pit crewmembers. The interviewee is always forced to use the name of sponsors, car owners and other suppliers as every other word in each sentence. “Thanks Bill, I couldn’t have driven this Ronnie’s Pulpwood Bubba’s Garage Dodge Charger all 500 laps here at the Trojan Condoms Raceway without the help of them super Goodyear tires while quenching my thirst drinking some of that good ‘ole Gatorade sports refresher.”  After each race, the driver finally gets to Victory Lane after tearing up almost all of the grass in sight doing donuts and burn-outs and when he exits the car, having pulled off a logo adorned helmet the size of a beach ball, he then is forced to put on a baseball cap with some other logo on it. Then they line up soft drink and sports drink bottles and other consumer products on the roof of the car behind his head and body-less hands and arms appear in the TV picture to force feed him various drinks from prominently labeled bottles to the point he can barely answer the questions being offered by the TV reporter.  Imagine if the early explorers like Columbus, Cook, or Byrd were forced to submit to this kind of TV coverage and did interviews and had product sponsors like NASCAR has today. I know there was no TV back then, but just imagine if there was. Columbus’ return from the new world could have gone something like this:  Headphone-Clad Announcer: “So tell the viewers, Chris, are you glad to be back here in civilization?”  Columbus: “ Well I’ll tell you, Vito, we definitely wouldn’t be here in first today at the Pope Pius IX Marina if it weren’t for the performance of our fine vessils--the Guido's Shipyard Queen Isabella Ragu Spaghetti Beteroulli Olive Oil Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria. They just sailed so smoothly. Of course, we did loose the Pinta about half way home due to engine failure.  Announcer: Engine Failure?  Columbus: Yeah, the sails, they blew right off her in a storm, they did…it was really something to see!  Announcer: “What about that incident at the midpoint of the trip with the native’s canoe outside the Virgin Islands—are you going to hold a grudge with him on the next excursion to the New World?”  Columbus: “No, I don’t think so, we just love sailing, and things happen when you are going eight or ten knots. This Guido’s Custom Shipyard built fleet of ships just ran right over those itty-bitty dugout canoes—I think that Indian is still swimming home right now. He won’t be no trouble in a year or so when we’re over that way again.”  Announcer: “Did you ever think that you and your crew wouldn’t make it back here to Europe?”  Columbus: “No, not at all. We all had every confidence that these Queen Isabella Guido's Shipyard Italian Solid Oak ships and Mercury Vesevius outboard sails had the muscle to keep us in the lead most of the trip and bring us on home safely…but, by the way, there was that one incident when the Indian Chief caught me with his youngest daughter…boy was she ever a hotsie-totsie…  Announcer: A Hotsie-totsie?  Columbus: Yes, boy or boy, breasts out to here    and legs down to there. Whew wee, I didn’t know if I was going to make it back with my skin intact let alone off that island that night…er, um, never mind…forget what I just said…    sorry honey, I'll be right home.”  Announcer: Where do you see yourself and your crew going from here, Mr. Columbus?  Columbus: You see that there moon up there in the sky?  Announcer: The Moon?  Columbus: Yes, well, we’re working with this guy named daVinci, you may have heard of him, on this new kind of ship and boy I tell you, she beats the heck out of the speed and power of these babies we just got off of. We ask the fans to just watch the news in a few hundred years and see what we’re doing. It will definitely make your head spin, it will indeed.  Announcer: Well, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it here first…now back to you in the studio in Madrid, Mr. Jennings…

      Spending ten continuous days living out of suite cases in a hotel room brings me back to a reality that I have spent very little time with since college—the Public Laundry.  That’s what the sign on the door says here at the Holiday Inn Hotel and Suites in Elgin, IL.   Laundromat, Wash-O-Matic, Rinse-and-Wring, call it what you may, each and every visit provides a wealth of entertainment opportunities and interesting insights into human nature, and invariably brings you into contact with persons and situations with which you could otherwise do without.  Of course I have had, through the years, intermittent opportunities to further develop and maintain my college developed skills in the public cleansing of my most personal clothing items. The issue of boxers or briefs become quite evident unless you properly sort, handle, and maintain control of your clothing items before and during your visit to the local “Palace of Clean Clothing” (POCC for short.)     For instance, there was that time when I ran away from home, after separating from my ex-wife, and I was forced to give her the old Kenmore washer and worse, the old Kenmore dryer I had recently, lovingly, totally rebuilt for a cost of a hundred thirty six dollars and fifty-five cents  (or something like that.) The personal cost of a weekend of cursing and scraped knuckles was extra.  I later learned that she promptly discarded both the washer and dryer in favor of brand new equipment once the divorce was final—she just didn’t want me to have them.  She tried the same thing with the 30-year-old Snapper self-propelled mower I had also rebuilt, but you know how it is with a man and his lawnmower.  I think that lawn mower cost me about five thousand dollars in the final settlement, but it was worth every damn penny.   Any way, back to the local POCC.   I rode the elevator down to the second floor about one o’clock this afternoon, carrying our white clothes and my four-dollar mini-box of detergent, purchased from Rashee, the friendly Indian proprietor of the lobby gift shop.  Somehow, I avoided buying a genuine imitation Rolex watch or a cigarette lighter that looks like a pistol (against FAA regulations, you know)--but I was awfully tempted.  Upon arrival in the POCC, I found one of the two washers filled with someone’s unwashed blue jeans and one of the two dryers in mid cycle.  Undaunted, my heart full of hope, I launched the load of white clothes with $1.00 worth of quarters, $1.50 worth of detergent, and planned my return 20 minutes later with the colored clothes.  Wrong you stupid, white, redneck man.  Upon my return twenty minutes later I found BOTH dryers in operation and the load of blue jeans mysteriously in mid-wash cycle.  This was war. What (or whom) was in that second dryer?  I again left the POCC briefly, planning to catch the one dryer at the end of its cycle and then load MY own second load into MY washer.  Again, wrong, you paleface redneck.  Another ten minutes and another three floor round trip on the elevator found me and a four foot tall middle eastern woman glancing furtively at each other as she partially unloaded both dryers and fumbled with clothing of all sizes from 6x to Jolly Green Giant.  Was this woman running a laundry service out of the Holiday Inn POCC?  Could be…  Another elevator trip up three floors, another ten minutes writing this story, and back to the POCC where I found both washers empty, one dryer available, and the little woman with the red dot on her forehead nowhere to be seen.  I sprang into action, untieing the sleeves of my dress shirts from the knot they invariably form in the rinse cycle and gleefully launching another $2.50 worth of quarters and detergent into action.   An additional dollar bought me the services of the available dryer.  I was turning the corner, in the home stretch now, ladies and gentlemen.  Three floors down, and three floors back, and my heart is still singing the pleasures of clean, although slightly damp and wrinkled clothing.  The aforementioned mysterious load of blue jeans was doing nicely in the dryer also.  Got to run, now…I have a dollar date with a lovely, appliance-white-colored clothes dryer. She’s mine, Mine, MINE I said, ALL MINE, get away, dammit… I THINK I NEED A DRINK.

      I sent this E-mail to the Neal Boortz show this morning:  Mr. Boortz,  How about looking at this story linked from Drudge Report:  http://news.myway.com/top/article/id/381249top08-09-2004::17:46reuters.html  In summary, after Candidate John sKerry admitted that he would have gone to war with or without the presence of weapons of mass destruction, he then goes insane again with this gem: "Kerry challenged Bush to answer some questions of his own -- why he rushed to war without a plan for the peace, why he used faulty intelligence, why he misled Americans about how he would go to war and why he had not brought other countries to the table."  Here are my answers if I were President Bush:  President Bush- Question 1: "Here John, take a load off and have a Wendy's burger on me ( I know how much you and the missus love them) and listen for a moment so we can straighten out you and the rest of the Democratic Party.  First of all, I'm not aware of a single war fought in US history in which the plan for peace didn't involve first bringing our foe to their knees and, after thoroughly kicking their ass(es), spending a few years overseeing restoration of order and a functioning government on an organized basis according to OUR RULES. In addition, we generally pay for the repairs and restoration of the country involved (even if we didn't cause the damage or deficiency) out of US taxpayer funds.  And by the way, ask the French, Spanish, Russians, Germans, or Hannibal about their diplomatic policy in the 1500's to 1700's for alternate policies. We've voluntarily omitted the raping and pillaging (but we do put panties on the heads of prisoners occasionally.)  President Bush- Question 2: "Yes, some of the intelligence that the Congress, the office of the President of the United States, and our Allies used to make the decision to go to war has since proved to be flawed...but, it's not like we started out on a 1000 mile airplane trip with a wing or propeller blade missing off of the airframe. The flaws were subtle, John, and only proven years after the fact. Hell, we still took off, made altitude, and landed at our destination with fuel to spare. Most of the American people think that the general outcome was worthwhile in the end. Get over it.  President Bush - Question 3: "Now Mr. sKerry, how did I mislead Americans about how I would go to war? Were not the numerous UN resolutions, the obvious danger to the rest of the free world, and America attacked on our own soil not enough?  What part of this equation do you and Mr. Edwards think that Americans didn't understand? Were people confused about which end of the gun would be pointed at Iraq, who made the bullets, or how effective our state-of-the-art military would be at reducing the Iraqi Military to "resistance status?" Call them bands of street thugs, call them insurgents, they are anything but an organized army/fighting force once we got through with them. Let the liberal press use their code words, the problems in Iraq today are caused by TERRORISTS, not freedom-fighters.  President Bush - Question 4: "John, John, John, why do you and the liberal media insist on stating that the US has prosecuted a unilateral attack on Iraq when British, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Dutch, Australian, Romanian, Bulgarian, Japanese, Thai, Danish and other forces have been involved in concert with our efforts for over a year? Why, I've heard that even the Spanish continued to send Sherry, Port wine and Tappas snacks after they pulled out their troops this spring. Why do you insist that because France, Germany, and Russia are not supportive that somehow our efforts are less effective or illegitimate?  For the record, since 1947, any UN effort that has actually seen real combat and security threats involved primarily US troops, US designed/built ordinance, and US lead command and communication structure. Excuse me if I just cut to the chase and got the job done. By the way, I'm not one bit sorry that we have been so effective to date."  "Now excuse me, Mr. sKerry--I have a country (and unfortunately--a campaign) to run."  See You in November.....  Why can't Mr Bush and the Republican Party just come out and tell it like it is???
