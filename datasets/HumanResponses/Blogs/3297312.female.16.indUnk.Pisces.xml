      I really do get annoyed a lot of the time, but I just don't show it. Except when I'm at home... Gd what the hell is wrong with watching a couple of minutes of TV?? I don't get it. and my mom always jumps to conclusions--thinking that i was going to be watching it the whole while they were gone. Does she think i don't care about studying and grades and all that shit? i do! thats why i fucking go to this school, but i really didn't feel well right after they left, so i decided to lie down and rest for 15 min. she came back right after i had turned the tv on, got REALLY pissed, and said that i was grounded. wtf. and its pointless to   try   to even explain. ARGH> fucking a.

      Well, in case all y'all readers were wondering what exactly my blog name means, I'll be happy to explain it to you. Please proceed to vocalize the title "Maza Rasha" out loud. This is the correct pronunciation (a.k.a. with thick, horrible Russian accent) of Mother Russia.  As many of my dear friends and acquantances are familiar with my heritage, I will tell you that I am of course of Russian (or should I say SOVIET!) descent. I come from Kiev, the mother of all Russian cities, the capital of the fertile lands (er..formerly fertile--before Stalin..) of UKRAINA (The Yoo-kraine..)!!!  Hm. I think that's enough communist like propaganda for one evening..  Anyhoo. Let's see how my life is going on right now, shall we? Are you interested? Intruiged? Do you think I have hoards of boys at my doorstep, waiting with a number to get to kiss my toes and shower me with stuffed animals and diamonds?  Wow. I'm flattered. But no. this is not how the Castilleja (achem-all girls school-achem) leaves us to develop in the real world.   My school is basically the center of my life. I'm not bitter or regretful, but that's just the way it damn well is. Nothin can be done about it--gotta live another year (OMG!) with this school and environment and PRESSURE!!!: meaning I'm a junior...finals coming up in less than a month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mother.   Well, seeing as I have shit to do and am somewhat tired...I should cease my procrastination and go clear the shit outta the way.  Ciao bambinos

      hrm...so i find this internship to be quite dull, messy, and sneaky. it really is not how i intended to spend the idyllic, carefree summer days--in a windowless office, fighting for my right for some computer time with some younguns...ah, well, pine mountain lake will come soon...and i will be chillaxin on the beach .. gtg!
