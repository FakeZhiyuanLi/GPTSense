      Dearest sis...giggles..i am just going to write this as if i am writing to you..cuz you make me feel good and smile.  so anway....first..comments to your comment...i emailed you about some of them, but i will respond to the rest here.  "letting master know how i am feeling" hmmm..you know..this is a hard one for me..cuz i hate to upset him.  sometimes i just say everythign wrong.  however other time..he is the most wonderful thing..and i can tell him just how i am feeling.  it is really hard for me..as i want him to know that i am feeling lost or a bit jealous...but sometimes i think i am just getting a bit out of hand and need to just relax and remember that i am his wife/slave..and he is "allowed", lol, to have other girl friends.  now..before you get all worried..you are different.  i know you..and you respect me..he and i talked a lot about you..and you being part of our lives..and believe me..i would tell you if i was uncomfortable with your and his relationship.  lol..i am babbling...anyway..i do try to tell him how i am feeling..but most of the time..i just push it down in my heart so that i don't get him all upset or bent out of shape.  I dont think it is that he ignores me..but more that he just doesn't always think about what i might want.  it is always about making him happy..getthing him what he wants.  my needs have to fit his. sigh..however sometimes even that isn't always true..like i like to get my nails done as my real nails are soo yucky.  he has been urging me to get them done as soon as we have the money...smiles.  a friend described it well.  Master knows after a scene, when i go down..he knows to cover me up...to get me a drink...to soothe me...tell me i did well in taking his beatings...now..why oh why can't he move that to the rest of life.  not all the time..but every once in a while... he does sometimes..but i think i would like more reassurance that i am important..and needed.  i guess sometimes...like lately, i need to know that, even though he has other girl friends, they are NOTHING compared to you or me...lol  mumbles about stupid women feelings and emotions.  if you wanted to hint..you sure could..i hint for you sometimes..lol.  and the mistress parts..goodness...that thought has always been there..lol.  i know i couldn't be a top..but to just have a male to worship me..do everything for me...sigh..that woudl be awesome...and..lol..i think i could only do it every once in a while.  i need to serve..it is who i am..but man..to have a foot rub everyone in a while sure woudl be nice.  soooo..this jealousy thing...Master has an online friend..who is a girl.  now before we left for vacation..she was just that...a friend.  she knows who i am..and i have chatted with her sometimes.  she is nice, but a bit to "stubborn" for me.  she is really the kind where it is her way or no way.  like she is always frowning and fluffing when master talks about how great eq2 looks and will be.  it is like she is trying to be his mistress.   well she practiclely fell all over him since we got back and her attitude towards him has totally changed.  she is purring and moaning and tell him to skip work and upset when he says he has to log off...they play Linage 2 together.  she is really a late night person, and while master thinks he is too..he isnt'..lol. anyway...i think it is starting to border on cybering..which really really hurts me.  i know it shouldnt'...cuz it is just a game...but this isnt' a character and charater type relationship like eq...this is person to person.   i brought up my thoughts on the way she is acting and he got upset with me..saying i am just sounding jealous. and maybe..in some ways i am.  i dont' like sharing my man unless i have given permission...lol.  and yes..you have ample permission...she on the other hand...smirk...i like her..and i am glad that master has a gaming friend..but she is getting a bit out of hand.  i mean..she is the only person he talks to online every night..for hours at a time.  i mean he chats with you when you are on..but when was the last time you had a long conversation with him? although..he does do about 6 different things at a time..but still...you are his slave too..and deserve his attention some times.  fluffs about rambling again.  sooooo this chick is starting to bug me..PLUS..i am seeing kind of a submissive side of master..which i am not liking.  i dont' like the way she is pushing him around and the way he is just bowing down and kissing his feet..even when he doesnt' really feel like it.  this is what happened in eq..with Nahris's wives..and it was just a horrible mess.  while i may be a bit jealous of her..i would not let that effect my thoughts on something that i think would save him a heartache in the end.  sigh..so anyway..to sum it all up..i dont' like this new chick...but don't know how to tell master that something just isn't right.  i tried to mention the submissive thing to him..and he got upset..said i was reading into things.  which maybe in some ways i was..but the way they interact is soo much different then anyone else..and man..he takes care of her..talks for hours with her..laughs with her...god she has even come up during a cudding session...i hate it.  sigh.  fluffs about stupid women emotions.  ok that was a bit long..sorry...just ranting.  hugs to you sis...it is good to have you.

      so...here i go...posting here so that i can just be honest with how i am feeling...not worrying about  whether or not i will hurt someone's feelings by what i am feeling or thinking. M is driving me crazy...he is soo obessed with X and it hurts so bad...just like always.  I am always feelign this way anytime he finds a new friend..but lately..she is getting a bit more clingy. we went on vacation and when we got back..she was just drooling all over him...telling him how much she missed him and all that good stuff.  now she is really pressing him to write...which is what i have been doing forever, and wham..just like that..he can write up a beautiful story..just cuz she asks and purrs at him. they talk a lot on the phone too..and i worry.  it is so hard..i have been working so much..always on my day off..and of course..he has sat off..so he has all day to do whatever he wants, which used to not worry me..now..i dont' know. sigh...life is not so bad though..well except for all the money stress....i have to get the check from mom cashed today..and i am soooo worried that the bank is going to be anal or something like that.  i just want the money..and no trouble...i wonder if it will ever be that easy.  god..i wish i could jsut work mon-fri...i could do all the ot then..and it would be soo much easier for me.  i could have two days off..and relax...sigh..oh well.
