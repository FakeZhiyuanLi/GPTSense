       I was listening to the television, it’s often on for background noise.. and Good Charlotte’s song came on and it stopped me.. I spent this last week with most of my family and while that was awesome, it really brings up a lot of negative crap too.. just missing the family that’s no longer here, showing the kids pictures from when we were kids and knowing my dad could still be here with us, that it was his choice to leave, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to reconcile that.. it’s been over 18 years, I was only 15 when he died.. I’ve lived longer without him than I had with him and I feel cheated out of every moment. Alas life is change, it’s pain, learning, growing, it’s anything but fair. This is the “soundtrack” in my head, I’m stuck with it.. figured I’d share...    ********************************************************************   Hold On ~ Good Charlotte  This world, this world is cold But you don't, you don't have to go You're feeling sad you're feeling lonely And no one seems to care Your mother's gone and your father hits you This pain you cannot bare  But we all bleed the same way as you do And we all have the same things to go thru  Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know  Your days you say they're way too long And your nights you can't sleep at all (hold on) And you're not sure what you're waiting for But you don't want to know more And you're not sure what you're waiting for but you don't want to know more  But we all bleed the same way as you do And we all have the same things to go through  Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know  Don't stop looking you're one step closer Don't stop searching it's not over...hold on  What are you looking for? What are you waiting for? Do you know what you're doing to me? Go ahead...what are you waiting for?  Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know  Don't stop looking you're one step closer Don't stop searching it's not over...  Hold on...if you feel like letting go Hold on...it gets better than you know...hold on    ********************************************************************    Tears In Heaven ~ Eric Clapton and Will Jennings  Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven. Would you hold my hand If I saw you in heaven? Would you help me stand If I saw you in heaven? I'll find my way Through night and day, 'Cause I know I just can't stay Here in heaven. Time can bring you down, Time can bend your knees. Time can break your heart, Have you begging please, begging please. Beyond the door, There's peace I'm sure, And I know there'll be no more Tears in heaven. Would you know my name If I saw you in heaven? Would it be the same If I saw you in heaven? I must be strong And carry on, 'Cause I know I don't belong Here in heaven.    ********************************************************************   Out of Control ~ Oingo Boingo  Everyone says sooner or later you'll reach the end of the line When things get rough some think it's easy to jump the ship . . . You decide  I say--don't throw it away There's about a million reasons why Though you've heard them all before And you're getting very tired Lay your head on my lap and I'll sing you this lullaby  Don't you know That everyone around you Has felt the pain you feel today You're out of control yeah--and you want someone to tell you When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream You're out of control . . .  There's a cloud-rollin' overhead and it seems to rain on no one else There's a black sun--casting a black shadow, and I know you feel so all alone You're out of control--and you want the world to love you Or maybe you just want a chance to let them know That you live and breathe and suffer And your back is in the corner and you've got nowhere to go  Nothin' for nothin'--everything's right at your fingertips--for a price Who ever said that life on this planet would ever be paradise I say--don't throw it away, you've got too many things to say If you throw your life, if you throw away your life . . . THe world will never be the same  Don't you know That everyone around you Has felt the pain you feel today You're out of control--and you move without direction And people look right through your soul You're out of control--and you want someone to tell you When you wake up in the morning it'll only be a dream And I wish that I could tell you, it'll only be a dream

        urlLink     Yesterday was an awesome day! My family and I went to Disneyland together and it was the first time my brother’s kids had ever gone. I grew up in SoCal so I have tons of wonderful memories of being there, it’s one of my very special places to go because I have so many memories of my dad and family being happy together. So sharing in there first of hopefully many more visits to the Magic Kingdom over their lifetime had great meaning to me. I think my favorite part personally is that we got to see Fantasmic and the fireworks show after. Usually I miss Fantasmic because I tend to go around my birthday in November so I can see the haunted house changed into the theme of “Nightmare Before Christmas” and when it’s the colder months they don’t do that show.  It’s unbelievably cool to watch, basically there is a river in the center of Disneyland where Tom Sawyer’s Island is and the Mark Twain riverboat circles. Well on the stage set to look like a mill on Tom’s Island is where a lot of the action takes place but it’s the water itself that becomes alive with color and animation as they continuously shoot it up into the sky creating a screen of mist.

       It's been one of those nights you "survive" and I want nothing more than to rest my head on my soft magenta pillow scented of lavender and vanilla, close my eyes, and drift into sleep. Instead I'm awake, minutes from my shower, and getting in the car to go be with my family who’s flying in today. So tonight.. sleep eludes me. I hate when all your body wants to do is collapse but your mind won't shut the hell up! For me it has produced some interesting creative works.. still "givin my druthers" I would enjoy not sleepwalking through my next day.  Tonight I can't seem to get these words out of my head.. a common problem I have.. the brain just latches on to something and doesn't like to let go until I am sufficiently maddened.. at least it's from one of my all time favorite movies =) Some comfort is better than none I'm guessing.. ok off to the showers with me.           There’s no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going There’s no knowing where we’re rowing Or which way the river’s flowing Is it raining Is it snowing Is a hurricane a-blowing         Not a speck of light is showing      So the danger must be growing      Are the fires of hell a glowing?      Is the grisly reaper mowing?      Yes!  The danger must be growing      For the rowers keep on rowing      And they're certainly not showing      Any signs that they are slowing!

        Well I have an odd sort of tradition in my house I thought I'd share. Long ago I got a set of magnet poetry for my frig.. yes, even getting food is a creative experience in my life (grin) and this set was called "cat talk".

         This empty page is mocking me My pens run out of ink The words are dancing ‘round my head So loud that I can’t think     I sit and try to catch my rhyme The cat’s just chased it back So don’t blame me for the lack of prose I’m under some attack      These feeling felt deep down inside Want to see the light of day But the day is running into night So in darkness they shall stay!

       Up all night.. back again in the early morning.. never before has a game so completely captured my attention as  urlLink EQOA  has. From the day the beta CD came in the mail to present day I have been totally enthralled. I have always loved RPG’s, I've even been looking to dust off the old dice, but this one takes the cake. I’ve met so many great people, and I love my guild “A FIRE INSIDE”. I used to go through games pretty fast.. buy them for $50 and a week maybe two later be on the hunt for another. But now even though it is the same quests and really very few places I haven’t been, I take a great joy helping others achieve their goals and level their characters. I have a 60 cleric a 58 mag a 54 druid and a 24 enchanter =)       So I’m finding my free time is becoming less and less as I spend a great deal “in game” I also frequent our  urlLink message boards  there.. and now thanks to blog.. I have this wonderful new realm of self expression to fill with all things me.. Hmm, I wonder if I’ll get any work done? (smirk)    Well today I will leave you with a personal favorite of mine.. from the first moment I read this poem in freshman English I knew Poe would always have a special place in my heart. I love his darker stories, whenever I fly.. which is far too often for someone who dislikes it.. his book is the one I always have with me =)    Annabelle Lee by Edgar Allan Poe  It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me.  I was a child and she was a child, In this kingdom by the sea; But we loved with a love that was more than love- I and my Annabel Lee; With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me. And this was the reason that, long ago, In this kingdom by the sea, A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling My beautiful Annabel Lee; So that her highborn kinsman came And bore her away from me, To shut her up in a sepulcher In this kingdom by the sea. The angels, not half so happy in heaven, Went envying her and me Yes! that was the reason (as all men know, In this kingdom by the sea) That the wind came out of the cloud by night, Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in heaven above, Nor the demons down under the sea, Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful Annabel Lee. For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride, In the sepulcher there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea.

      Raised up on broken promises Fed on shards of shattered dreams We strive to always please you With our muffled little screams  We’re fallen angels Hearts, torn & mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths &amp; lullabies  Deaf ears & cold blind eyes Spawn our fall from grace With each silent knowing face Another angel, slips away  Conceived in your conjectures Cultivated by the fears Nourished in the nothingness We embrace for many years  We’re the fallen angels Hearts, torn out &amp; mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths & lullabies  These monsters in disguise Maim without a trace Dissolve us in our place Another angel, slips away  Sunken in your footsteps Entangled in the past Some wounds will never heal These scars we’re made to last  We’re fallen angels Hearts, torn &amp; mangled Twisted and tangled In half-truths &amp; lullabies  Even ourselves, we now despise Doubt dwells within the space Carved out in our disgrace And another angel, slipped away!

         If you are a dreamer, come in,     If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar,     A hoper, A prayer, A magic bean buyer...     If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire     For we have some flax-golden tales to spin,     Come in!     Come in!       ~Shel Silverstein      Shel was one of the greatest influences in my young life, no wonder I have and insatiable need to rhyme in most of my poetry. The books that shaped me, called to me, were those like “Cat in the hat” “Where the sidewalk ends” and “The giving tree”. By age eight I could word for word recite most of these books and poems to you, I would read them over and over and even now, when I find myself in hard times, I still turn to them. They gave me a wonderful gift, a love of poetry, and a will to write some myself.. because in doing this, I heal and grow even in the darkest of hours.
