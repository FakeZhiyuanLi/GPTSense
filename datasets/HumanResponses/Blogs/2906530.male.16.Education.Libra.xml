      Just a short rant today for I'm going oot. Dick and Dom in "da" bungalow is the most pathetic idea to appeal to children what is it?  It is 2 20 year olds acting like fools for 3 hours that seems like an eternity. One of their favorite activities is to go into public places and say "bogey" at different levels of noise to see what the reaction is. What is entertaining about that?! Its all in all a poorly conceived idea which seems like it was made by the makers of the tweenies trying to appeal to older viewers. I best not get started on the tweenies because I could go on forever.

      Still on the subject of Americans WHY THE HELL ARE THEY SO ARROGANT AND IGNORANT! Here is a list of annoying American phrases 1. We saved your ass in WW2 As an answer to that. America got its ass kicked by a Developing country with very little force and not  a major world superpower with a massive army like us. Secondly America only helped us when it suited them and would have gladly let us perish so I don't see why we are so thankful to them for letting us suffer daily bombings from Germany. Thanks to world war 2 we lost our superpower status (France too) from having no money left from having to rebuild on top of paying for armed forces. Whereas Americans sat tight at home with no death or destruction raining down on them and watched their economy grow. We also never actually lost the war but had a small boost of US soldiers which didn't help much. We should thank the Russians for storming Berlin in 1945. They did more work than Americans.  2. You don't speak English at all, you guys speak a whole different language. How can that be the case when we are English!? We invented this language and you hijacked it to alter with as you see fit and then trying to impose it on our impressionable youth  3. Do you know the queen?  Do you know the president?! How would I know the queen when she's all over the country at different times and doesn't exactly fraternise with us "commoners"  FOOLS!

      AVAST YE ALL! Its time for another Dave Rant. The subject of today's rant is how we lose our civil rights because of fear of a terrorist attack. David Blunkett the home secretary today outlined an inicitve to secure Britain from terrorism. These plans suggested tapping phones to use as evidence to bring convicted terrorists to justice. I'm all for stopping THOSE BASTARD TERRORIST WHO BELIEVE THEY ARE COMMANDED BY GOD TO KILL. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING BUT RELIGION IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO KILL PEOPLE GET IT! THANKS TO THEM EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY AMERICA, IS PARANOID ARRRRRGGGH! But anyway I don't think we should have our private lives infiltrated by a constantly causious government even in a case such as this. The problem is this kind of thing makes us more and more like our paranoid American (twice removed, and twice disowned) cousins. Why do we as a nation aspire to be like the Americans and try to use systems like their which are known to be poor. That's the world we live in.  P.S if this rant is being tapped I am not a terrorist but I am just a adolescent who doesn't like being observed by the (American style aspiring) government.

      Hi everyone here is my only rant of today (I think) As you may or may not know. Mr George W Bush, President of the USA (that's sure not what Arabs call it) has begun his campaign of re-election. He has promised to lower taxes and to make the world safer for Americans. What I want to know is how can that deluded moron expect to do this. As we have seen in his first term he has made the world twice as dangerous by invading Afghanistan (My Grandad was Afghan so this is somewhat of an insult to me and my family) and Iraq, these have caused the world to further destabilize. The world also cannot expect America to chip in to help the environment. Here we see America, the biggest polluter of the world backing out of an agreement to prevent global warming which has screwed up the weather already as you can tell. This was done to help the US economy grow. Well this is what pulling out of Kyoto has done for Bush, America has slid into recession and there is growing unemployment in the US today due to this. Well done George. I don't see how lowering taxes will help him with this problem but unfortunately in America the greediest of all the capitalist states, money talks and this may win him the election sadly. THE FOOLISH GREEDY AMERICANS! WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE SUCH MORINIC FOOLS WITH HEADS FULL OF NOTHING BUT CONSUMERIST RANTS LIKE "LADY WHERES MY BURGER, I ORDERED IT 4 MINUTES AGO. But if to them their waste line is the only thing that matters should we be surprised such a fool could become president anyway.  Have a nice day while you still can.

      Well I'm still tired but before I sleep I will have one more quick rant I've just been reading "stupid white men" so I'm charged up with rant power. Have you noticed how Americas paranoia is going to destroy the world. I'm afraid that's what things may come to. Only when America ceases to make more and more potentially dangerous defense networks and continue to stockpile weapons we cannot sleep easy. Iraq is no danger compared to America nor is terrorism. I assure you that the war on terrorism is not going to solve a thing and will in the long run make America more enemies abroad therefore meaning they build more weapons and I think we know how it will continue onwards forever. That's all for today people

      Well its a new day and IM tired from my first day back at school (neh!) so I wont be ranting as hard as usual but here's a go for today (may I just thank all my loyal fans for recognizing me)  For today's rant I make a slight merging of yesterdays rant and my rant about rood bois (due to calls from my fans)  Well I will begin by saying rude boys are scum of the world and are nothing no matter how "bling" or "bad" they think they are! They are all fools and more to the point they are bullies and cowards by using physical and psychological attacks against other people, what the hell is tough about trying to intimidate an old man or a pacifist teenager or adult. What is more to the point is how these Idiots think it is tough to do their dirty work using weapon, and this is the point where American gang culture is to blame. Thanks to this we see more shootings in the UK than ever. I finish with this final though and this is the part my fans will like the most. YOU ROODBOIS OR WHAT EVER YOU CALL YOURSELVES (LEARN TO SPELL AS WELL) ARE SCUM AND IF I WERE IN CHARGE I WOULD LAUGH AT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND TAKE A POWER SANDER TO YOUR BOLLOKS! HOW DO YOU LIKE USING WEAPONS AGAINST INNOCENTS NOW THEN!  I will now take this moment to speak out against a group of people who are in my school. They are by no means an official group in any sense, but they do have a habit of sticking together. I call them Hockey boys due to the fact they are on the school hockey team. Some hockey players are alright but many of them are muscle brains to name names to people who know them (yes this is a continuation of yesterday I know) they are fools who prey on the quiet and intelligent with their pitiful sense of humor, what is worse about this fact they never get tired of this painful "laugh a minute." All I can say is that their stupid arrogance will lead to their fall one day and I hope its a very long fall for some of them. well that's it for now cya

      in deference to dickybods thing aboot roodbois (yep im having ago at them again, why BECAUSE I FUCKING HATE THEM. THEY ARE BASTARDS WHO RUIN EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE, IF I WAS ALLOWED TO THEN I WOULD KILL THEM ALL IN A BRUTALIC FASION) but anyway i wish to direct my perpetual annoyance at people im forced to put up with on my travels.  1. Jacob Lifely: a one eyebrowed neandethal who is quite strong and therefore believes he is  powerful person in school. he also beat up one of my friends once for a trifel matter and if ever do in my lifetime achive a level of strength beyond any comprehension (who knows it could happen) i will pay him a small visit 2. Dan Fox: a lankey hockey player (we're building up a good idea of his personality already arn't we) who is completely abonoxious and is  a fool!. He lives with the delusion that because im a quiet chap that i will not rerespond to his painful stupidity. thats what he thought. I got my own back later, when in germany he nicked my gba for a laugh and i lost it and hit him. it was a satisfying moment and he was rather dumbstruck by the matter. few words have been exchanged by us ever since 3. David Vance: he is also a hockey player but he is also a tennis player. He is also an obnoxious fool. naturally him and dan fox get on like a house on fire. he thought it was funny last year when he sat behind me in english to hit my back with a bendy ruler. what i would do to him if i got him alone with a bendy ruler is best not mentioned. overall i really want to kill or maim him 4.Paul leonnard: he is a small dog faced person who for some reason hangs around with the duds and me. we all treat him abrasivly, even jon the nicest person in the world cannot stand his presence and has verbally told him this to his face to go away. the only thing this individual is good for is for punching. 5.Matthew cook: he keeps talking at me even though i make out i dont want to listen to his drivel. and when i get frustrated he gets up on his haunches. (even my form tutor agrees with this.) whats worse is i sit next to him in maths well thats all for now folks wasnt that refreshing

      I am still pissed off AAAAAAARRRGGGH. If someone ever pushed me boyond the point of self control i wonder what would become of the world. maybe i'd go super saiyen.....nope even im not deluded into believing that would happen, but anyway DAMN THE GOVERNMENT! im doing my GCSE's this year and my A levels next year but now the government is planning to make them different and easier. Why why are the exams getting slowly easier and WHY ARE THEY ALWAYS CHANGING. does that mean my 2 years of hard work will be all for nothing! It is a slippery slope like this that could see us having multiple choice tests for uni exams. why do we copy america when we know their system sucks

      Ah its a new day, but i face the horrifying prospect of going back to school from half term tommorow (NEH!)   but as i said before its a new day so its time i started to moan. American influences are killing off our countries charecteristics and i by no means mean to racist but, a lot of it is through black culture in america where our terrible american influences come from.  As i grow older (at an alarming pace i might add) i notice the problems in young children today (I know i sound like a pensioner but this is the fact of the matter) one thing the habit of kids now knowing all their rights (or rites as they may write in school ARRRRGH THE PAIN!) is dangerous as they think that they can push the police aroud, which takes the piss in my opinion of the idea of a society.  What is just as worring is that the inlueces of our american chums (did i say chums i meant oppressers) is causing our youth to speak act and write like americans (who calls trousers pants i ask you). sadly i believe that soon we will be reffering to petrol as "gas" and calling chips "fries" and even worse than that we may end up pronouncing aluminium like them (at that point i will go mad and start a killing spree maybe).  I know how easily influenced children are from the american shite on tv. I myself remember copying how an american pronounced water for a short time until corrected by my mum. it has made me forever angry that the americans brainwashed me. damn it!

      im Going through a troublesome point in my life. gone are the days when i can get away with anything. at this point im expected to be responsible for my actions. this isnt always a problem as new responsibility brings its perks. in this case some well needed respect from my elders. where the problem lies is that we are seen as adults by our adult peers. the problem is we are clearly not and we are still with held by the rules of childhood. why is it that we are expected to be like adults yet we are treated like children. life is strange

      In response to john (a fellow blogger of mine) I wholeheartedly agree with his views on gang culture where i think the problem lies in this case would be from the rolemodels Footballers are an example of this. they are constantly in the public eye, and the way they behave on the pitch (not respecting the authority of the referee in this case) Is a major step in the wrong direction and gives football and our over passionate fans a bad name. Im not trying to stick up for football as i am not a fan of it. but a lot of the burden of this problem needs to fall there.

      What is wrong with music?  Its far too capitalised thats what! gone are the days where bands wrote their own music and played their own instruments. what we live with in music now is pretty boys who can bearly sing (one need only look at Gareth Gates and the hordes of other young hopefuls littering our charts, to know what i'm talking about)  It is annoying! its capitalism gone mad. what makes things worse is the record companies who are trying to make a quick buck out of these naive young fools, get ticked off when we the spending public object to spending our money on their overpriced CD's and instead download their cheapo crap.  That aside what also annoys me is overhyped bands i.e "Blazing squad". What the hell is up with that then!  10 or 12, 16 year olds (my age for gods sake) from the mean streets of Essex pretending their hard rappin' little men. What is tough or manish about hanging around in a group of 12. I mean isnt that just cowardess! but then to make matters worse when they start calling themselves a squad. one could say 'oh they may be good musicians' well im sorry but i've listened to their music and felt physically sick.  One may be lead into believing that rock music was still independant but even that has been plagued by this annoying prettyboy problem. The problem my friends is "Busted" need i say more before i lose it and start killing people with annoyance at their pathetic drivel. They pretend to play music when they clearly cannot.

      The foolishness of roodbois! Roodbois continue to baffel me Only today two of my friends were beaten up by roodbois in a horrific fashion. to be specific one of my friends stepped on a roodbois foot as he tried to trip him up and for that they were jumped twice and were outnumbered 6 to 2! As if that wasnt cowardly enough they then proceeded to take the one who trod on the foot in question and he was hit round the face with a crash helmet as well as being continually punched around the face. All I can say is : MUST WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE CONFRONTED BY FOOLS LIKE THIS OF VERY LITTLE OR NO INTELLECT OR COMMON SENSE! APPARENTLY SO AS WE NOW MUST BE CAREFUL NOT PROVOKE ONE LITTLE BASTARD WHO THINKS HE'S HARD! LEST WE FACE THE PROSPECT OF BEING JUMPED BY HIM AND FIVE FRIENDS! WHATS HARD ABOUT THAT ANYWAY! AS THE IDEA OF BEING HARD IS FIGHTING YOUR OWN BATTLES OR AT LEAST EVENLY AS THIS CASE IS, WITHOUT USING WEAPONS! HARD! COWARDS MORE LIKE IT ARRRRGH I HATE THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      ARRGHH THE PAIN (that's right I'm back) The subject of my newest rant is that of my very first one. MUSIC!  Music in our fair land (its a bit of a dump really if you go to some council estates) has reached a new low. Why? Because topping the charts at the moment is "DJ casper" with his hopelessly lame dance hit the "cha cha slide". I have two reasons for hating this tune  1: It is completely unimaginative and is stupid with pathetic dance commands like "slide to the left, take it back now Y'all"  2: I had to endure this song twice daily for two weeks in august last year while on holiday in turkey (Turkish music is a hell of a lot better than that believe me its quite catchy, no wonder they won the eurovision song contest n.b I had to endure that song everyday too but that is a lot more manageable)   Another problem  is busted once again If it wasn't bad enough they tarnished the good name of rock with their previous songs but now they have done a cover of "teenage kicks" a brilliant song and their equivalent has made me cringe what with their sickly sweet untalented young vocal chords (ARRRGH!)

      Today my rant is at the Quintessential Evil corporation, Mc Donalds!  Mc Donalds as we all know is a massive particularly eevil American fast food chain selling fatty undercooked overpriced burgers to the customers, (they claim that 100% beef goes into each and every burger although I highly dispute that claim). Mc Donalds has taken my disgust a step further lately by their new "hip, cool" style advertising campaign aimed at the most vunerable group of people, Children. They have changed their slogan as many will have noticed to "I'm Lovin' It" which on its own is appalling as there is no such term in the English language but no, They go a step further and have made their new happy meal adverts to comply with this new hip, young, cool image, the Advert begins with a group of about 5-6 kids asking "what's in the boxes that always rocks?" (In my opinion it should be "what's in the box which always flops?" but that's just me) and in the advert these young children get sucked into the happy meal box (of evil and obesity)and end up in the world of whatever the toy at the time is (most recently "Noddy") and start chanting an awful attempt at rapping which will make you sick to the stomach using terrible rhymes like "today we're gonna' go far, to the tiny planets on a white so-fa!" (shudder)and the thing about these adverts that ticks me off the most is not the fact that their polluting our young children's (and to a certain degree many adults) minds but they've started referring to Mc Donalds as "Maccy D!" THIS IS A TERRIBLE AND VOMIT INDUCING TERM, THERE'RE TRYING TO TURN THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHILDREN INTO A GROUP OF INNER CITY STYLE SPEAKERS LIKE BY CALLING EACH OTHER JAMMY D AND DERRY F! EGADS THIS IS NO DIFFERENT TO WHAT HITLER AND THE NAZI PARTY TRIED TO DO TO GERMAN'S YOUTH BUT AT LEAST THEN HE WASN'T TRYING TO POLLUTE HIS LANGUAGE HE WAS TRYING TO STRENGTHEN IT! Another new horrifying addition to the new "I'm Lovin it" style Mc Donalds is the new  salads plus range, this is simply Mc Donalds trying to escape the stigmatism that it is unhealthy so they are trying to trick people into buying their new "green" salad ranges of food. This is the attempt to attract the on the go, health conscious mum into the restaurant so that the kids can nag their parents with more weight behind their argument than before.  I'm of course not going to fall for these clearly evil ploys but then again they are only acting in the interests of our "clearly" non-evil capitalist democratic system (yeah right) whoopee go capitalism (err no) this is what the American government and much of our "righteous, free western world" want us to think.

      The subject of today's rant is about a certain animal like acquaintance I am forced to be in contact on a daily basis I have named him in my list of people I hate that's right folks its that dog you love to hate, Paul Leonard. Me and him were having one of our daily discussions which go along the lines of:  ME: Paul you wanker, piss off Paul: (in a harsh and threatening untertone) err no Dave you fat piece of shit now let me explain to you the facts Paul is a scrawny some what weak person. Some may say, "wait he might really be strong for all you know" well your wrong as in the past he has been beaten up by a year nine much smaller than himself and was tripped up once in football and broke his leg. Not only that he has punched me before and I would say that it was nothing to go crying about. Now this all brings me to today's escapade Me: (holding a water bottle chuckling menacingly, pretending to tip it in to his bag which to add insult to injury had infect happened to him the day before) Paul: Dave! Stop it or ill kick the shit out of you  Me: yea right ill believe it when I see it. Now let me just emphasize the point pails fighting and brute strength track record is very poor and not to mention I am very strong (I'm not trying to tute my own horn but I am) and I am well trained in Ju Jitsu so any pathetic attempt to "beat the shit out of me" would have been met with a painful blocking technique and then an even more painful arm, wrist or shoulder technique, not to mention all of his current threats have never come to light so I really just ignore his unvaried and non fear inspiring threats and insults. well that's a few thoughts off my chest for now.

      Gather round all followers (thats right all 6 of you) of my scriptures (the daily rantings that is) And I shall tell ye a tale. I am going to actually talk about my disgust at the cartoons that nonnesuch talked of on his blog recently.  I happen to despise extremists of all religions. I have been called arrogant for believing that, "humans dont always need to look to a higher power for direction" but the stuff on that web site you can see here: http://www.chick.com/catalog/tractlist.asp, is nothing more but arrogance. It has the nerve to make the claim that anyone who doesnt believe in Jesus is doomed to an existance in hell for all eternity. Now this again may be arrogant, but that doesnt seem fair at all, now lets face it life is not picnic, and some people struggle hard to do good, and be nice throughout there lives whether it be sooner or later. not an easy task, but then at the end of that, as is demonstrated in one cartoon, that you'll still suffer eternal damnation  if you do not give your soul to jesus. I personally am willing to suffer this, if it comes to that which i do not expect it will, i accept my fate and think jesus should stop being such a wanker about it if he is god that is.  I also dislike how patronising these comics can be, especially in the evolution one (incidently did you know that believing in evolution is a direct path to hell, OH NO WHAT WILL ONE DO!? i'll laugh personally) the little girl in the comic quotes "we must respect her as she is our teacher,even though she is wrong (about evolution being true)"  Now let me get the facts straight here:  Evolution: Scientifically proven with carbon dating techniques that CANNOT be wrong God creating the world in 6 days: No proof except for some so called holy scriptures that people fanatically believe in.

      Well as much as I have moaned about big brother being a lowlifes program's in the past. I have enjoyed the daily happenings within the BB house this year. For instance (with some controversy I might add) there was a rather unpleasant conflict of egos (by which I mean all the housemates got drunk started to smash thing and the night ended with a all out brawl and security guards were sent in.)  I feel that no matter what peoples views are about, if the series is now going too far, and, if we should have such "filth" on our TV's. The producers (using these shock awe tactics) have managed to get TV radio and the internet buzzing about the fight.  This just makes me also think that alcohol is one of the biggest dangers to society out there and is one of the reasons that our land is going down too. Then again I have never been drunk before so watch this space.

      Well I took a villain test and this was the result          urlLink What Type of Villain are You?    urlLink mutedfaith.com .   Its true in the sense that I wish I had explosive powers and super strength and that. My god would it be fun.  Now look at the pictures and just think how cool that would be:            Destroying the world infrastructure with powers like that and setting up a perfect collectivised regime with no stupid terrorists, Ignorant capitalists or ideological Marxist is one of my immature ideas, wouldn't be all difficult I suppose when no one cares about voting anyway, plus I could wipe out a few people I don't like or feel are owed a taste of my wrath(MC FLY ARE FIRST ON THE TARGET LIST! SO WATCH YOUR BACKS OR FRONTS AS THE CASE MAY BE YOU WANKERS MUAHAHAHAHAAH! SEE IF THE GIRLS WILL FANCY YOU WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU).  One person I would like to destroy now is the person who writes the business studies exams, I incidently sat this exam this morning although it was not difficult unless you ignore the fact that us as candidates had only 75 minutes to do 12 pages approx of writing, I swear revenge upon the examiners for this, INHUMAN MONSTERS! Well I think I did alright but I really don't want to think about my result, as I worry of getting a D grade as that is what I got in my last exam (I don't base that fear on my performance as I really don't know how I did). But then again that is the past and I felt more competent of righting my past errors in that field. Apart from that I have only 4 exams to go TWO MORE BLOODY BUSINESS EXAMS!!!!!! And history and physics which are not so bad. I can't wait till its all over. The worst is probably passed though.

        THE RANDOM HAPPENINGS OF DAVE RECENTLY(ITS ALL BORING ARGGH!):  Random indeed yes, as not much has been going on with me. On a normal free day when there are no exams I get up at aboot 07:00 or later and then revise for about 3-4 hours throughout the day with about 12 study sessions of aboot 20 minutes. Not bad you may think but the problem for me is that I get sick of revising. Its not fun however you try to organize it and to make things worse for myself I get paranoid when I'm not revising!!!!! Its an irritating cycle of not knowing what I want to be doing whether it be simply enjoying life in my own way or revising for these "crucial" exams. Why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Apart from that this week not much has happened to me or anyone I know, not that I would know anyway as I haven't really got the chance to talk to anyone about anything except these BLOODY EXAMS! As if that wasn't bad enough on Monday I've got chemistry which is rather a more tiresome science as there are horrible things in it like electrolysis, emperical formulas, folding and faulting and that! I've also got my first business exam at the end of the week which promises to be one and a half hours of boredom, bitterness, business knowledge and paranoia for myself considering the last two grades I've got for business have been D. Why do the exam boards find it necessary to write such horribly boring and tough exams where you don't even have enough time to think your answer through (actual teacher testimony) which normally ends up the size of a small essay thanks to the evil mark scheme. My friends who do Business like Nonnesuch and Davey C will also be forced to sit down and suffer this pain on Thursday although they don't have to worry as much about cocking the exam up (again! Even though I thought I did quite well last time) and getting a GCSE grade D in business. Life can be very cruel it seems!

      Here's a rather late response but oh well For the past 3 or 4 years I have passed up on the idea of watching big brother dismissing it as puerile trash, but since watching the opening show of the new series out this year I cant get enough of it, this year is particularly funny as the house this year is chocked full of oddballs as you can see in Nonnesuch's blog. It has been made all the more funny at this current moment what with The feminist Lesbian house-mate (who goes by the name of Kitten! I mean what a silly name) stirring up trouble and generally getting on the other housemates backs, ohohoho hilarity is sure to follow now, I will not go on about it much. But all this has basically taught me not to turn up my nose so often. that was all a bit level headed wasn't it.  Well here's a short rant: what the hells up with Gwinth Paltro and Chris Martin (the lead singer of Coldplay) calling their newborn baby Apple! As much as they might be wrapped up in giving their daughter a beautiful and Artsy name to suit with their Hollywood and fame persona's, it is clear that they didn't stop to think of the repercussions that this will have on young Apple's life, especially when she goes to school (unless she's home schooled), she'll have to contend with daily taunting about what a silly name she has. I can only say I'm sorry to think of what misfortunes this very silly name will befall the poor girl.   As for me I've been living through the daily panicking of exams coupled with worrying about not doing enough revision, even when I'm revising I worry about not absorbing what's in front of me. All in all its been horrible and I can't wait till it's over.
