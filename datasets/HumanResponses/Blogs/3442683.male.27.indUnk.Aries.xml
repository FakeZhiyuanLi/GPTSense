						   As an avid soccer fan, I have been glued to televisions around the Toronto area watching Euro 2004 soccer games.  One place that I have gone to see a few matches is this English pub with a friend of mine who is rooting for the English team.  One chap in the bar with an English accent who obviously likes a pint or 2 of lager kept on saying "scuzi" every 18 seconds while we were watching the Italy/Sweden game.  The first time he said it was clever, the 2nd time comical, the 3rd a little tiresome...by the 89th time, it was getting quite old.  But seeing that he was 300 pounds if he was an ounce, I decided to let him be whimsical.  Anyway, I am rooting for the Italian team (go Azzurri!).  They must beat Bulgaria to have any hope of advancing coupled with a Sweden-Denmark result that isn't a 2-2 tie (I haven't exactly figured out how that works).  It's funny as the Italian media have suggested that Danes and Swedes may conspire to tie 2 all so that they advance in the tournament and eliminate Italy.  It's always a conspiracy against Italy I tell ya!!  Isn't that always the way...trying to keep the Italian man down!!

						   Well, I went to talk to my lawyer neighbour and he was in fact more than happy to give me a hand.  He asked me to send him my CV to his e-mail address and that he would start asking around for me.  He was mentioning some of the contacts that he and his partners have, and I may be foolish, but I feel...well, not exactly totally hopeful, but not as jaded and hopeless as I have often felt.  Hey, maybe I'll be a law-talkin' guy after all!!

						   Tonight, I am off to see my neighbour...usually, that's not a big deal.  But seeing that he has offered to help me in my legal career path, it's a meeting that I hope ends with good news.  I have been finishing off school with the (now mistaken) assumption that I had an articling position with a small firm in downtown Toronto.  However, to make a long story short, the position was given to another person...yikes!  It's not the first time I have been dicked around by those in the legal profession, so after my initial reaction of outrage mixed in with self-pity, I was like "whatever" and let's go on.  So, my neighbour who is a lawyer and a good man has offered to give me some help.  We'll see if he can get me the boost I need.  I'll keep you posted.
