      If theres one problem with working with the public, its there stupidity.  Questions like:  "Are you still open"...my sign is down , i dont have any other costomers, and im standing there for what reason!!!  AND then there are the people who walk right up to your till, when you have your sign up, and start to put thier groceries on your till, argh. Now i know when its busy, people are frustrated and want to go through, but come on now, if the sign is up Im closed.   AND then there are also the people who have been shopping at the same store for years and know that they pack thier own groceries and still expect a busy cashier to pack them up for them.  And Visa/Master card where I work we dont take them. We ring orders through, then they bring out the visa/master card and we say that we don't except them at this store. Usualy i get "oh OK.. Ill use my debit card." but the reaction I like best is , "What you don't except this... this is a stupid store" then they leave thier groceries for us to put away.. What happened to looking for the  Visa/Master card stickers in the front entrance window . I mean people come on now!!!!  Lets see what else.  Oh yes! People who pay for one small item with a 50$ bill, its a pain in my ass to count out the change when im working express. Talking about express.. Oh my! First we have the people who decidenot to read signs or decide since their a "senior citizen" that they can have me ring them through. And then there are the people who complian about the people who went over the 11 items.. Oh my god.. if there going to complain they let the whole store know!   Also... Thank you to all the people who make fake bills you have made my time at work so productive.. we now have to check every single bill that comes through our till.. and when we find a fake one we have to blot it with a bleach substance that makes a white spot on it.. and the costomer that had the fake bill gets all pissed off at us for marking a fake bill that she cannot pass on! Oh my god if its fake just burn it! This kind of thing makes such a hassel for cashiers that for sure!  Anything else.. I think ive run out for now! ill post more again later! Well if i offend anyone, remember its my opinion that ive written here and i am actually a nice person, this is a venting section.

         Beads are the neatest thing that I was ever introduced to. I am becoming quit the bead artist now. I started my beading life with the bead loom and the patterns I created for it were pretty good but they were missing/lacking something!     Then I found the Peyote stitch, it can be used as a flat stitch but 3D objects can also be made with this stitch.     I also created my own beaded dream catcher pattern. I was looking at a dream catcher that my inlaws have and said to myself "hey I can make this"..so I did. They look realy nice and i will post a picture on here if i can of one of them.     I also, found a wonderful magazine its called Bead & Button...so many ideas in there, i done some patterns and converted others from B&B and would recomend it to beaders who have not already been aquanted with this magazine!   There are so many different stitches you can use and learn in th beading world I have yet to fully master all of them but I will one day. There will be more to come in this post so keep watch!

      You know i never thought that i would be an Aunt and the way it would affect my life. I would miss my Nephew dearly if i didn't live in the same house as family. I get to see him every day, and yes i do take care of him every once in awhile. Right now hes about 6 months, and oh my what a kid, hes cute and adorable and quit a handful.  I was there when he was born. My sister had to have a C-section, so i couldn't be in the room. I must say my sister did a hell of a job. She pushed for a couple hours, and the pour guy was too big to come out naturally. I creid when she had to go into the surgery room, then when my nephew came out in his fathers arms, hes was so small, to look at. But when he was placed in the nursery he was the bigest one there. All the other babies in the nursery were premies! I was able to go into the nursery when he was measured and weighed. And thats when i realy broke down, i cried again and thanked Pete for my nephew. he was a georgous little boy. It took them 2 days to come up with a name, Nathaniel-Thomas Aiden Wolfraim Burke, such a long name but one with great meaning. (                    Meaning here              )  Well ill post more later.

      Floods really suck, its really benn hard for our family. You know when it happens to you, you never wish it on other people.  There are 7 adults and a baby living in our house, on thursday July 15 2004, the life we had changed.  I was visiting my aunt in lindsey and when my aunt came home from her apointment that day they told me that peterborough was in a flood emergencey situation and people were being evacuated, it never past my mind that my house was hit by the flood. Then i called home, to make sure that everything was ok. Oh my, and it wasn't at all, we had about 2 feet of sewage in our basement. I was so upset. My aunt said they would drive me home, then i was talking to my Paul, i told him to come get me, because i needed to be there. i passed the phone to Ber because mom wanted to talk to her and she said that she could take me but by that time paul was already on his way. It only took him about 20 min to get to lindsey, it should have taken him longer but, hey! When i finally got home, and saw the damage the sewage had created on our street i was shocked, heck im still in shock, i think the whole hosehold is still in shock. I lived in the basement along with Paul, my mom and dad.  we lost pretty much everything except our cloths and the stuff that was above 2 feet. when i walked down stairs i was awwed that we had lost so much. its like nothing you could imagine. but we could do absoluty nothing for ourselves. we had sub floors and we still had sewage in our basement but we couldn't deal with it until the adjusters came. So we helped out our neighbors the best we could. we had a shop vac from the inlaws we were using and another neighbors and mom and i went around and shop vac'd out other houses.  My sisters boyfriend also had a sound studio down ther too, and he lost all the equipment that was on the ground, and all the wires attached to the equipment that wasn't on the ground.  The insurance adjuster came i think saturday afternoon to see what kind of damage we had from the sewage.they took photos, and assesed the basement. then they said that they knew of a different emergency clean up crew other then the one we would have gotten. We got a phone call just after 6, it was First General Services, emergency response crew, and they were going to be right over. Now these people had driven from Sudbury to help out the crews here in peterborough. They were at our house before 6:30 and didn't leave until after 9:00 that night. they tore apart our basement for the next 2 and a half days.  Yes thats how much stuff we had!! My mom was in a state of complete shock, she didn't know were to start the clean up, but thanks to Anne-Marie and frankie, and here crew, we didn't have to pull anything out of our basement ourselves. The next morning we started going through the stuff that was to be thrown out because of contamination. Every thing that we couldn't keep that meant something to us we had to catologue. I took almost a full week for us to do that, not to mention the large 30' by 10' by 9' bin we had, that we filled three times. sub floors and everything! We are so greatful for the team we had from Sudbury we would have never gotten through what we did as quick or as organized with out them!  So the clean up is complete in our basement mostly everything that needed to be torn out has been, except some sub floor that still needs to go thats under some walls. Mom and i are just about finished all the cataloguing of everything weve lost, as well as our spouses. All thats left now is to file the claim and wait for construction to begine then we can go on a spending spree of sorts!
