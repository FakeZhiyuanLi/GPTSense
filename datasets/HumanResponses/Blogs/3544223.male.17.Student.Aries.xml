      Half a year had just gone like a flash. The next moment i know i will be taking my GCE O level exam. SO many people have already started their revision while me? hm.. of course i have and i have completed just that i still need more time to master every single subject. Life is so bored but quite fun to mix around with different groups of people every now and then. My cicle of friends keep enlarging every now and then. Some people might say that i must be mad to visit a haunted house in the middle of the night at  Changi Beach. Well, i think it fits my character. I am bold enough to try so as my group of friends. This isn't our first time going to such places. We have went to OLd CHangi Hospital and many others. The best thing was that we even took picture at that kind of places where people say ghosts or spirits does appears every night. Up till now we havn't encouter any of these things except that we got chase by guard dogs? or maybe i should say wild dogs. Fun indeed to spend my whole night and wee hours of the morning doing something that not everybody dares to try. Myabe this is what i call life. Though i have many kinds of friends new or old, but i still prefer to be together with my old friends. I am proud to say that they are the only group of people who understands me and the most caring people around me. Haha.. some of you might be jealous but well i didn't comdem you all yet, just that maybe you all still not up to their standard. ;) Time will tell and my opinion will change also. My days in DUnman is counting down, my years in Dunamn is also coming to an end. During my years in Duman, many things has happened to me. I bet this comment goes to all of you too. But me? mostly unhappy memories, happy memories there is but not many. Some of you asked me if i will return to help you in your study? My answer will be yes if you really need my help if not most probably i won't return unless nescessary. Hm.. i shall write till here.. 3 straight days never had a good sleep, today going to sleep like dead human. haha.. ;)   notice:By the way, if you all want to find me, the easiest way is to call or sms me if you want a quick reply.

         Time flies so fast, with a blink of my eyes, half the year had gone just like that. Everything around me seem to drift further and further apart from me. It is as though i am near my death date. Ever since i declare to step out of Atrina life, i have many doubt about lots of things. I some how regret patching up with her, even though that time when we patch back i told her that i would never regret but i can't pretend that i don't have any feeling about it at all. The feeling inside me was like very chaos. I don't know how to describe it. I only know that i can't help but think of her everytime but at the same time sort of had this feeling of wanting to tell her straight that i hate the thought of her treating me like a toy. It is like a ghost who can only come out at a certain time of the day, i am just like the ghost. A certain period of the year, she will come finding me like crazy like that then after that it will be like a cold war though out the year already. Just like a season like that. *sigh*. I don't know, i just hope to forget her as soon as i can. I myself know that it is hard to get ride of this feeling but i really have to get ride of this feeling and forget her totally before i can move on in life to do greater things. I am now hinded by her face, her feelings all these. I really don't understand what way i am no good to her?    Every where i go is just like a dead city to me. I am always like talking to ghost, walls, zombie, air whatever. I feel like i am getting away from girls and not the other way round. I some how don't trust what girls says. I rather don't believe in them or just don't feel like talking to them. What my friend told me was, " forget about her, she isn't worth the cost to be so madly deeply in love for her! You should go out to find a better girl, sure you can get somebody better than her ten times, twenty times." say is so easy but done is not. I have to face up with so many obstacles in front of her, while on another hand i have to make sure i do not bring my emotions into my study at all. *SIGH* I am very confused now, what i hope to do was to get out of the school and go into poly so that i won't get to see her forget in my life again. I hereby swear to god that i won't return after i have taken my result at all cost. No matter how she is going to plead me i won't go back to her anymore. I hope what i swear, i am not going to regret it my whole life.

       This is my first time posting in a blog so pardon me from not knowing certain things. All of you might be curious to why i put the title as "~winter~gone~". Well, i have a reason for doing so. Many people in life faces different type of obstacles and difficulties. Some of them try all ways to avoid trouble while there are some who ran away from their problem thus causing much pain in them. Why am i saying all these? I am telling all these because i would like to share my own personnal experience with some of you, hoping that some of you do not make the same mistake as mine. I know that some of you might not agree with me cause each person has his or her own point of view of certains things. These people could give me some comment and maybe some solutions so that we can help others who are facing the same problem as what i am facing now.    I shall start with something short and sweet and going through in much details as some of you might read until fall asleep. I have an ex-girlfriend, recently broke off because of some unknown reasons. I do not know the real reasons up till now but my love for her have slowly faint away weeks by weeks. I know her since i was in secondary 4, while she was only in secondary 2 at that time. We know each other through another friend and we started chatting in MSN for quite sometime. Things progress further on that we sometime meet up to have chat. First starting to chat on the phone at night till day breaks, then i meet up with her near her house sometime to chat. Few months pass, a sudden abrupt change in her. She turn around and ignore me and even scolded me to " FUCK OFF". I was very shocked when she scolded me that. She was the only person in my life who scolded me the word. She was indeed first in almost everything. She was the first girl that i have ever go out to meet in a park, chat until so late in the middle of the night, first person whom i sacrifice so much and willing to do anything even to death. First person who ignore me also the first to leave me, leaving this friendship. Only till the end of the year, she suddenly talk to me and try to get back to me. At first i was not very interested to get back to her cause the tear in my heart was not fully heal. I slowly accepted her, news reach my ears that she like Bing Chen. Whom was my last Best friend but because of certain things, i fall out with him up till now i did not bother to talk to him so often though i swear to my grandfather grave yard to forgive and forget about the past.     Comes to near Feburary, i stead with her but this only last for a month before we broke off. It was just a week before my birthday that this happen. Up till now i do not know if that sms was on purpose or accidently sent to me. But i do know that my heart tells me, she send it to me on purpose. I didn't really want to ask her so much of the real reason. I did try but i know whatever the reason she gave was not from the bottom of her heart. After this incident, we didn't talk so much, even if we saw each other. It was like we are a world apart. I do not know how to express my feelings, deep down in my heart, the old wound torn open again and new wound appear. She had given me two wound in my heart. Really first person in my life to start all these. Everyday even though i feel very sad, i did not really show it to my classmate or whoever not even her. My tears did drop whenever i recall the past. I went to the beach almost every day and sit there for an hour to think. Recently i asked her about her marks, i was very shocked that she was the last person in the whole class. At first i did not believe until i asked again she told me the same thing again. I thought she might be joking with me thus i asked her for the last time and she scolded me " FUCK OFF" AGAIN. She had scolded me 2 times!   2 times you have scolded me this word. I am very dissappointed, downcast. I don't know how to descibe this feeling. My heart already bleed a lot and tear more than ever, adding on with this, it worsen. I logged off MSN messenger immediately. Just yesterday, i told her not to return the 30 bucks to me cause i find that there isn't a need anymore. I think the 30 bucks will be the last thing that i would lend my helping hand to her. I don't think it is worth it to further help her anymore. NOw she likes another guy i know. And since i am JUST A FRIEND, not her god brother i am not as important as anybody else in her life. I once told her that almost alot of people like to used me and now i really would like to tell her that she is indeed really using me and not really treat me as a friend. I know this is not important anymore cause it bascially waste my time to tell her off. *sigh* I don't know what to do. But my heart tells me not to bother about her anymore. Should i?

          Today went to school for a meeting with the sec 3 leaders. Sad to say 2 of the heads now are suspended from attending anything that has got to do with peer support. I think i also didn't play a good role at the begining to help them but i am just trying to saverage Peer Support as much as i can. Year End camp seems to be months away but time flies by so fast that the next moment i know i will be conducting the last camp in secondary school. Don't really want to put the meetings on a saturday because Atrina is around. *sigh* but i got no choice as many of them cannot make it on weekdays even myself thus i have to put it on saturday. Next week is the last meeting and also last Peer Support Program for the Sec 1. I can only be there early in the morning to make sure the Sec 2 and 3 are in proper attitude and so on and so for. After my E-maths mock test i will have a meeting with them till don't know what time also.  &nbsp; I saw her today conducting Red Cross but when i look away and walked away from the area, my heart ache and memory return. I can't forget her, i want to but i just can't. What is this? Torture to me? I don't know. But I swear that i will have nothing with the school unless necessary. I told my old friends if being a god-brother is a good idea, they don't agree that i should. Somehow i cannot be a god-brother to some people, i don't know why? I prefer to be friends with them instead. Havn't been so active online since holiday until now. I just hate the thought of seeing her nick or even have the mood to chat with anybody online in some sense. Steve and melvin are the only 2 person that i have been chatting with when i am online early in the morning and after that i won't be online at all. I think i would need to practice more and read more english. It sucks a lot but at least i am able to pronunce it properly and clearly, that was something good but there is still room for improvement. 'O' level is drawing near, but some how my mind still can't let go of her!! why!! I tried all ways but none works. It hurts further more. *sigh* *sigh* &nbsp; &nbsp;

         This week seem very busy at the same time very tiring for me. I have to rush alot of things and yesterday i went out with my classmate to study maths. Today couldn't make it cause i am just too tired to study thus i same home early.Haiz... My feeling for her slowly drift apart as weeks and months passes. It seem i have my own target in life to achieve. Now in this world nobody understands me best, none at all. Sad to say this but i have some outside friend who treat me very good. I know them through a game and even though they like to tease me a lot but they treat me very well. Better than some people i know in school. I had a few outing with them and they brought me to a lot of places and i learn quite a number of new games like pool, which i learnt in within a day. Steve was one of them i chat with most of the time online other than yiwen and a few others. Even though he is older than me by a year but he treat me more than just friend, a brother to me.     Life is full of obstacles, either you try to pass it or you will be stuck there. I remember i created a poem about life is an obstacles but it was long lost a few years back. Today actually want to go down to Pasir Ris Beach to write my last will on the rock that she wrote about me but i changed my mind and didn't go. Yesterday 13/7/2204 Tuesday. I saw her walking home alone, actually wanted to call her but i changed my mind and accompany my friend to go and study together.*sigh* i feel very bad. i don't know i don't know. Everytime i see her i don't know weather to avoid her or should i just face it. My heart in a confused state.

       My last year to race in my whole entire Secondary School. I was not really prepared for the run at all. The race started half way, my old injury acted up. I nearly gave up running but something keeps flashing in my mind. You know what is it? Its her face but i don't know why i am doing these. because of her? i don't know. She was at the check point 7 but somehow i force myself not to look at her and quicken my peace to get away from her. Some how i wanted to find ways to hate her so that i can forget about her, but i juz can't. It is soo hard. As i was near the finishing line. My old injury get worsen. I had no choice but to force my way until the finishing line. Reaching the finishing line i got 20th position but my chest was so terrible hurt that i was not able to walk about so much for the next half an hour or so. I had trouble walking around or even standing up. I squard on the ground several times because the pain was so unbearable. At that time i was thinking of jumping into the sea and drown myself to end my suffering but i didn't. I picked myself up everytime the pain acted up again. Maybe that was what i deserve, the pain was a form of punishment for me. Some asked me if i would find another person and lead a new life. i said no cause i didn't want to and also i don't feel like to. The day ended quickly, i took a taxi home with one of my classmate.Just nice, a heavy downpour the moment i reach home. The following time of the day i went out to celebrate with my friends. His birthday was today, we had a lot of fun but some how i recall some sad memory also. Anyway i enjoy my day with them, they brighten up my life at the same time.

         hmm... first in 5A to take Oral last person to go off in the hall. Am i suppose to be happy or sad with the arrangement? I don't know also, what went through my mind was that i should look forward for the oral. My classmates will be taking their oral exam tomorrow 9/8/2004. I will be very free tomorrow to go out. haiz.. time passes so fast but certain things even with each passing time, i can't seem to forget that whole event. I don't know if i had known her for the wrong reason or should i say, i was totally wrong to know her right from the start. In life, everybody has to go through good and bad times. But my life is always going bad, no matter how hard i try it will go bad.    Anyway, nobody will know how i feel, even to care or understand my feelings. haiz.. haiz... i will go bonkers soon. Exam is so near but days passes so slowly.
