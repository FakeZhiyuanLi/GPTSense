						   I am opinions personified - i wonder if there is anything that i dont have an opinion about. Being a self-proclaimed atheist, sceptic, misomundist, misanthropist(on and off), misogregist, misophilist, misogaboorist, and miso-anthaksharist among others, i wonder if i can be any other way...  Having said that i fervently hope that by my holding opinions about things doesnt amount to being opinionated or dogmatic, for i hate opinionated people ;)  Was wondering why am i such a social mess? - why is it that when people see the beauty of a sunset, i only see (1/lambda^4)-dispersion of light; why is it that i look at the sky, i feel belittled and important at the same time -belitted by my very insignificance and important because of my part in the teleological cosmic drama; why is it that when people see a flower, i wonder how does it look in the ultraviolet spectrum; why is it that in a song, i listen to that violin piece that nobody bothers to listen or appreciate; why is it that where others reacted with horror on seeing the berg guy being beheaded, i reacted with indifference, saying if you can behead a goat on tv, you can behead a human; why is that when people are happy with a great psychological support by their belief in god and fate, that i should try it the hard way; why is it that when people are blissfully ignorant of their own mediocrity, that i should be aware of my own; why is it that ... well chuck it..  i guess at some point of time you have to accept yourself for what you are; and dammit, i am happy the way i am...

						   I wonder if the universe is a conscious entity... no, not the individual consciousness that characterises life forms, but rather a form of collective consciousness - the consciousness that emerges out of the cumulative awareness of the conscious entities it holds within itself....  And why is it that evolution proceeds with an increase in intelligence? Is the universe trying to know more about itself through the intelligence of its inhabitants? most impossible conjecture, but no harm in thinking about interesting things, in an interesting way, what do u say?  Whatever be the case, one has to appreciate nature for making a fool of humanity at large with the concept of love... Man has over-hyped the four odd chemicals that it invented in the form of hormones for propogation of species. How much ever you exemplify it, it boils down to one simple reason - multiplication and survival. why then all this hype?  and worse, it doenst even follow the laws of nature - choose the fittest partner to make the best gene pool - most humans fail there miserably... i wonder what will happen to humanity...

						   Planning to finish this before my laptop boots up. so, have to hurry...  I was rebooting my laptop, when all of a sudden this eerie feeling came over me - i felt like a laptop, or rather thinking of how does it feel to be a laptop. I forced myself to believe that i believe in fate, and indeed there i was, feeling like a laptop - right from being booted up by somebody, having no freedom to do anything on my own, doing what i am programmed to do by the "God" above, and worst of all, being blamed for what i am not responsible...  Well, if everything that i do is decided before hand, destined, pre-written or whatever, why should i be punished if i do something wrong and rewarded when i do something right - cos i dont decide what i do.  whatever action i do, i do it because i cant do anything else - punsh the person who wrote this, not me. and instead of punishing, that guy is being worshipped - just doesnt make sense.  with this thought, i already feel like a laptop, getting blamed for deleting a file that somebody else programmed me to delete.  Oh, and meanwhile my laptop has booted up. have to increase typing speed..back to laptopping...

						   A huge surrender to copy-paste to start with. could not have completed my current task w/o it. I am a heavy fan of plagiarism, if properly acknowledged. (this is to clear my guilt, cos i have plagiarised below ;) ).  This whole love, marriage and sex thing beats me hands down. see, i cant marry someone who i dont respect. And if i respect someone, i cant bring myself to have sex with her. if i cant have sex, what is the whole point of a marriage? AAAAAAAAAAAA!   SOMEONE HELP ME WITH THIS.....

						   Having researched enough in anglo-saxon etymologies, i realise it is time to delve into the depths of etymology in tamil.  Who in madras wouldnt have heard of the catch phrase of the city "  Saavugrakki, vootla sollittu vandhiya  " - a veritable classic as far as etymology goes...  Saavu  in tamil means death, and  grakki  roughly translates to customer. The familiar scene of some hapless soul making a furtive attempt at crossing an empty road and suddenly finding that he is standing right in the middle, with autos whizzing past him left and right, as he attempts final lunge to find safety on the other side of the road earns the distinction of being knighted with this title by the  auto kaarans .  Calling a person as  Customer of death  is an interesting way to ask a person "Why do you cross the road in this way? Dont you want to live any longer?"! Dont you agree?

						   Three terms that shook the world owe their existence to a row of eleven shady rooms flanked on left and right by dirty toilets.  The number eleven, more by providence than by coincidence, carries profound significance in the cosmic sense. Ten symbolizes another completed cycle, and by adding to its fullness, Eleven becomes the symbol of excess in any category, extravagance in promiscuity, violence, biased judgement, etc. The number heralds potential conflict. Its ambivalence is in the fact that it's excess may either mark the beginning of renewal, or the breakdown of Ten. It seems that generally speaking, the number is that of "individual initiative, but exercised without relation to cosmic harmony. It is a sign of inner conflict. It also derives its symbolism from Five and Six, being the macrocosm and the microcosm. In China, Eleven was the number which "in it's totality comprised the way of Heaven and Earth." It was the number of the Tao.  These eleven young men set out to change the world

						   Simple. I believe there is a definite  purpose  to my existence. People often tend to confuse fate and teleology. Accpeted, there is only a thin line that differentiates them. Nevertheless, the difference between them is stark.  For one, teleology does not talk about a conscious and inevitable finality that characterises fate. and unlike fate, it does not talk about a preconceived plan that humans struggle to endeavour.  And I am not comfortable with some philosphy that everything that is to be has already been charted by some arbit entity and I am, but a helpless dummy in all this.

						   Our fetish for self-antiquation never ceases to amaze me... Was reading a very amusing    urlLink  article     that talks about an ancient city in india that perished due to a nuclear blast. Was wondering why is this the case, when I realised two features that characterises a typical indain soul -   self-antiquation   and   mixing up mythology and history  .  The article, like other self-antiquations, has one central feature - anachronism. First, Sanskrit as a language is not 8000 years old - it came only after the indus (Saraswathi) valley civilisation. Anyways, Mahabharatham could not have happened before indus(saraswathi) valley civilisation, could it?  And secondly, the Ganga river basin was not settled until after saraswathi valley civilisation, which happens to be 2000BC. people have no respect for facts, if you ask me.  And talking of facts, I am sure there are people who will go to the extent of proclaiming the end of a yuga, and flood washing away everything - WHERE DID THE EVIDENCES GO??

						   I just realised two things  1. Humanity has not improved in the last 42 days. 2. I am not going to become a millionaire by writing.  Why such sweeping statements all of a sudden? I just found out that my  urlLink profile  has only 32 views.. (did you fall fo r the cheap trick? If not, do go back 17 words and fall)...  Such sweeping statements necessitate sweeping actions.. Here is what i plan to do  1.  Change the template of my blog.. (marketing funda)  2.  Give a title to the blog that makes it sound like you are poised for a great comeback.  3.  Do some cheap tricks...   a-   I plan to visit as many famous bloggers as i possibly can before my project manager kicks my ass, and comment on their blogs, thereby leaving a link to my blog (i am a genius)   b-   This method will take advantage of the quintessential human emotion - diplomacy... If i give links to other people's blogs, they are bound to give links to mine.   c-   Send junk mails to everybody, that says something like this:    I've been using Gmail and thought you might like to try it out. Here's an invitation to create an account.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deepika has invited you to open a free Google Gmail account. The invitation will expire in three weeks and can only be used to set up one account.  To accept this invitation and register for your account, click  urlLink here    ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Using a girl's name makes it twice as easy to fool people....     I dont expect many people to fall for this one.. If you have, congrats! u deserve an applause...     And to top it all, I have decided to blog everyday, plan to give RSS feed, and start a fan club for myself. Am looking out for a secretary.... Any takers?  Goodbye oh 32-profile-viewed loser... Welcome to the most shameless campaigner history ahs ever witnessed.

						    Controversy? There is no controversy if you take it in the spirit of olympics..  So say some of the torch bearers... and if bipasha basu can carry the torch, so can shakila... afterall, keralites have contriburted a lot to indian sports... and the best way to acknowledge it is to give the torch to the most famous malayali...  my vote goes to shakila...

						   i found a great remedy to boredom... the last time i was bored, i declared that i am in the throes of existential angst... boy, and life became interesting...  and now that i am smitten with the concpet of existential angst, i googled to make myself fit enough to be angst-ed. and this is the list of symptoms that i am supposed to sport   * You light scented candles   Cant understand why... bought them anyway...   * You sit alone in a small room and read   Nothing new, i do it all the time... but am u supposed to read with the scented candles? the manual is ambiguous....   * You feel as though you are carrying a great weight   Considering the average IQ of the world at large, and of the people who listen to radio city in particular,  i do feel that i carry a great weight!   * You consume an entire bottle of laxatives   Have asked nilu for expert guidance on laxatives.    You can smell "death"   Ahem...   * Your underwear is dark colored   Dont remember, and i cant look down and verify it in office.   * You spend time in the woods, doing natural things   Went on a trip to kerala to make sure that i get this symptom right.   * You feel a deep sense of dread within your bowels   Ya....i feel that every morning. the laxative thing might make it more dreadful...   * Your existence centers around a dark hole   No comments....   * You are suffering   Read my earlier blogs for confirmation.   * Your room reeks of decay   Done...    * When you look in the bathroom mirror, you see Sarte's face   does sartre look so bad? poor guy!   * You want to flush everything away   more of a compulsion than a want...   Having meticulously kept up all the symptoms, i was about to exclaim, when i realised that EA-ed ppl arent supposed to be happy... boy, this death thing sure stinks....   Googled more and found out the seven dimensions of fear that are supposed to grip me:       A. Exaggerated Fears.      B. Phantom Fears.      C. Plain, Ordinary, Everyday Anxiety.      D. When Normal Securities Disappear.      E. Fear of the Future.      F. Fear of the 'Nothing'.      G. Ontological Anxiety.     Interesting indeed.   does this sartre guy sport a frenchie, by any chance?    Who are my fellow sufferers? google is god!      A. Sartre (obvi, you say?)    B. Hitler    C. Batman (Wow)    D. Lewis Carrol    More to follow on my EA Series.. PS: defying all odds, i found out that my underwear is indeed dark coloured. And, existential angst also goes by the name of  Karmic Tithes  . am in love with this concept!

						   I dont understand what triggered it, but nilu has  urlLink lunged for marx's throat  in a way that is not very different from bush's purported  War against terrorism,  only to further his raison d'etre - single minded determination to raise to fame.   Marx has a long list of failed assumptions, the success of each one built on the success of the one underlying it. When the most basic assumptions were proved wrong, the whole pyramid tumbled, and there you see eastern europe and west bengal.   Where marx failed fundamentally was in&nbsp;judging the difference between indiviudual person's psychology and society's psychology.&nbsp; Marx believed in the inherent goodness of human nature, and the badness of the society. So, when you super-impose human nature on top of the society, you get a perfect society. Very childish, if you ask me.   And unwittingly i believe, he based his whole theory on envy. I am poor because you are rich... Quite ridiculous.   I have become a major fan of capitalism... But capitalism too is not without its share of evils. See, these ppl dont allow me to blog in office... Death to capitalism.   Will blog more on this soon...

						   18 long days have passed since i promised by faithful fans a blog a day. Well..living up to my words is not one of my strong points, so i am excused..  Actually wanted to post a blog titled  The travails of a wayfaring peripatetic , but found the title too flat to convey what i have been going through in the  land of liberty (ahem!)  The flight journeys, per se, arent even worth the mention... The flight out of bangalore was most depressing... with nobody to send me off on my maiden flight...Imagine getting your avain cherry popped with no onlookers... a most scary thought, i must say..  If bangalore was depressing, madras was distressing, with a million relatives pouring out of swaraj mazdas and battered tempos lined up ad infinitum, startling the airport authorities out of their customs-fattened tummies, so much so that i am sure a few of them would have even thought if rajinikanth is getting married to catherine zeta jones in madras airport.  All i wanted to do was to get the hell out of the place, which i eventually managed to, after spending half my life's savings on buying coffee...  Was messaging and talking on my cell till the flight attendant patiently explained the perils of how uncomfortable it might turn out if the EM radiation from my teeny-weeny cell phone( urlLink Samsung C100 ) can make the boeing 747 to come down in smoulders, somewhere between gooduvancheri and constantinople... not to be outdone, i made sure he served me red wine everytime he came within 80 metres of my seat.  To all those people who think that take-off is very romantic, here is what i have to say... Take-off has as much sex appeal as your grandfather's unwashed trunks... the take-off was not very different from a KSRTC bus from bangalore to madras, only a bit faster.. Even the person sitting next to you was just the same, pushing you aside and trying to peep out of the window...  The second leg of the flight from frankfurt to san francisco was a bit more interesting... there were a group of school girls sitting behind me, returning to US after a soccer tournament  discussing their steamy last night in europe...  more on maariatha's travails in the subsequent days... keep reading...  P.S: btw, the publicity campaign has worked out... look  urlLink here .

						   When will people come to know what to expect from the govt and what not to! When will the govt. stop supporting these weaklings...  Everybody knows the reasons why people dont go to kannada movies. Let them battle with their own ineptitude, and let them die in the process if they arent fit enough to survive. Why should my money go to inept producers?  Decades of socialistic leanings have made ppl expect ridiculous things out of the govt. The whole thing sucks.

						   Too bad... I was hoping to work for a year or two, save a few tens of lakhs, get a land in a "decent" area like koramangala, construct a ghetto or two, rent it out as PG accomodation, and make millions... Er, did i say ghetto?  If you plan to open a PG accomodation, here is one piece of advice - rent it out to girls - you can ask twice the amount for the same space. All you have to do is to keep saying a few adjectives like "safe", "decent", "decent", "safe".  Good move, in any case. My sadistic instincts prevail... Death to PG's psuedo-parents.

						   As bad an  urlLink article  as anything that came out of the sensationalistic rediff. But it shifted a few rusting gears in my head that havent been moving for quite some time....  Identifying my place&nbsp;in the political spectrum has been one of the most challenging and irritating burdens of my life, irritating because i keep swinging so many damn times from one extreme to the other.  To me, everybody&nbsp;has a place&nbsp;in the 3D space, emerging out of three axes - religious/non-religious, liberal/conservative, right/left. And there i am, in the rightmost top corner, ya-there! as a pseudo-secular right liberal... dont know if i have much company. Its been a long journey, but i made it! Thanks folks.

						   This boy is a musta. After watching some arbit channel called "Sci-fi", i realised how grateful i am to have read asimov. No green bug-eyed martian invading human brains, no mutant cockroaches having a prediliction for teenage virgins, and lastly no aliens landing on earth without a valid I-90 duly stamped by immigration and naturalisation service.  Appreciating science fiction is not very different from appreciating european beer. You should have tasted a bad one(american, so to say) to really, truly, whole-heartedly appreciate the good one. And once you've had the good one, you just cant go back. Nothing less than an antakshari competition in a room overflowing with gaboors with nothing around for miles around can drive me towards an american beer, not if i can find a gun to shoot myself first!  To all those lesser mortals would think Poul Anderson or John Barnes was better, i have only one thing to say - drink american beer, and then drink european beer. You'll realise why crusades were fought!  Thank you issac. I owe you a lot!

						   This day has been one of my darkest days, and what makes it even worse is the fact that i dont know what the hell is it that makes me feel so sick...  And i've been trying to find out the connection between self-pity and an all-pervading hatred towards everything in general and nothing in particular... well, almost nothing in particular... Its not everyday that i take the luxury of wallowing in self-pity, and everytime i do this, i end up hating everything in the world... can somebody explain.  Death to every living sentient and non-sentient entity, and destruction to everything that did not choose to live... i tell u, these non-living things are intelligent - they chose not to live... very intelligent.
