						   Well, this is my second day of working on this journal.  I'm still getting the feel of the process; and I don't know if it will work for me yet.  But I'm curious, and I want Jon to try it out. Which he won't do if he doesn't know what to expect. Which he won't know if I don't figure it out.  I keep thinking of extra things to add to my profile, the format used was a little confining.  For example, it's easier for me to mention favorite authors than it is to mention favorite books.  My interests are not really as simplistic as I like to read.  It's got a lot more to do with "read exactly what?"  But I suppose you must start somewhere.  I'm not sharing what I'm doing with my "posse" at work. I'm afraid they would find me and read me.  My quasi "goth" administrative assistant would get a kick out of the whole thing though.  Okay, that's it for random thoughts tonight. It's more about the process than the product at this point.

						   Okay, here we go again. The first time I tried this, it didn't work out very well.  That's what happens when a quasi "boomer" tries to use a new technology.  But I'm determined to master this one way or another.

						   Okay, this is definitely harder to keep up with than I anticipated.&nbsp; I think it's because I have too much esle to do.&nbsp; I'm currently watching an absolutely silly movie called "Phantasm II" while I wait for "Scars of Dracula."&nbsp; The second movie of course, will be much more worthwhile than the first.&nbsp; TV really is a wasteland sometimes. I saw the Stepford Wives movie, and it was quite a disapointment.&nbsp; I was really hoping for something a little scarier; this was just silly.&nbsp; Lately I've been whining because I just can't find anything fun to read.&nbsp; I really don't like serious "literature" type literature; and it's been kind of a dry summer for anything else.&nbsp;

						   Just finishing up an interesting and extremely hectic week.  A couple of observations about them.  My two nephews closest to Jon in age were up for the week to visit their grandparents.  Jon spent as much time with him as his dad could arrange for him to do.  Jon is an only child however, and his ability to tolerate other children and people can be fairly low after a while.  By Sunday, only threats of annilhation were keeping him polite.  They ended up going to the grandparents and Jon came home to do nothing.  He was much happier that way.  I spent a lot of time with them yesterday and have the following observation:      Even though they are close in age and in size, there are many differences between them.  One is "normal" another is extremely artistic, and Jon is extremely intelligent.  They are close in size, but Jon (although the youngest) is the most physically developed.  Which is unfortuneate, because he's also the least able to deal with his body.  (12 years)  The nephews are both not operating at Piaget's "formal operational" stage; while Jon is operating on it much like an adult would do so.  (As I told him this weekend.  His humor is very similar to a highly sardonic 35 year old man.)  Both nephews, although older than Jon, are at least one year behind him in school because he's so accelerated.  Neither of them appreciate that too much.  Finally, there was a lot of very subtle "put him in his place" stuff going on towards Jon.  I think it's just because of the developmental differences between them.  As we discussed; Jon definitely is experiencing asynchronnous development.  It's just that at school it's not so noticable, because most of the children are experiencing it.  However, all's currently right with our world; so I think we'll survive a little loger.

						   And so, I skipped a day and broke my very short record for continuous postings.  I expect that's going to happen a lot.  We're heading into the holiday weekend. Your life is pretty bad when what you look forward to is getting to work in quiet so you can catch up with yourself on the holidays.  I never was fond of holidays (outside of the Christmas season of course.)  Introduced my son to the movie "Lost Boys" tonight.  He has heard a great deal about the "Corys" that were in so many '80's movies. Tonight was the first time he saw them I think. He enjoyed the movie, the humor appealed to him, and the "gore" wasn't really that much compared to today's standards. I do like that movie, if only for the last line at the end.
