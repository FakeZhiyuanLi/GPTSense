      Another youth’s life is taken by senseless crimes this past weekend.&nbsp; I just do not understand for the life of me why someone would want to take another human beings life away.&nbsp; When I heard about this rather senseless crime, I cried.&nbsp; To think that years ago when I returned back from the Japan, I could sit in my car and hang with my gyrls and nothing would have happened to us, we took that for granted.&nbsp; I used to hang out in D.C every weekend, no joke from when I was 18 to about 22 years old.&nbsp; Now, you cant pay me enough money to ride through there.&nbsp; You have got to be out of your mind.&nbsp; Anytime a boy can ride down the street and get hit by some fool that is out joyriding in a stolen car, or when I am standing at the street corner and get hit by a stray bullet, or just chillin in my gyrls car and have 10 rounds fired into the car, please DC is not even worth it. Its not just in DC that these senseless crimes are happening but almost everywhere.&nbsp; Just this&nbsp; year alone there has been 16 deaths in just the youth in DC.&nbsp; Now if you multiply that by all the cities that we have, our youth is killing themselves before their lives even get started. Not to mention the youths that are committing the crimes are ending up in jail.&nbsp; Its time that our nation pray for real.&nbsp; We are living in our last days.&nbsp; There isn’t a day goes by where someone isn’t being shot or killed over something dumb or for nothing at all.&nbsp; I heard today on the radio that a young gyrl was shot over some braids, what in the world????!!!!!&nbsp; I know how black folks are about some money but was it really worth it to spend the rest of your life behind bars over a few hundred bucks, if that???&nbsp; I am not condoning violence in anyway but what happened to the old fashioned fights?? Even when I was in Japan the kids didn’t fight fair using metal bars and trash cans, what fists aren’t good enough anymore.&nbsp; Just like in the Next Friday when Craig’s father was talking to him about guns, being a man doesn’t mean pulling out a pistol when you are beefin with someone, you use your left and right hook, you might get beat down but you walked away….YOU LIVED!!!!! We aint even doin that no more…even if you have a clean fight you gotta watch your back because believe me that nigga’s “hood creditability” is worth more than your life, and you never know when someone is going to get payback. &nbsp;Man….what is the world coming to when you can not even sit in your car without fear for your life.

      Not meaning physically tired, although I am, but I am emotionally tired.&nbsp; Tired of being there for people that treat me half assed.&nbsp; Tired of giving all I have for someone that is content on giving me the left overs.&nbsp; I am tired of being tired. I just dont understand how you can put so much of your time, effort and energy into something and it turns out a total disappointment.&nbsp; Of course I am speaking of a relationship.&nbsp; I have several ones going on in my life right now with the opposite sex, that are all dysfunctional if you ask me but in the whole light of things they balance out.&nbsp; I am tired of having to juggle the attention I get from one to make up for the lack thereof I receive from another.&nbsp; I shouldnt have to do that.&nbsp; I am a good woman and I know that, guess that is where the problem is.&nbsp; Because I wont settle for just anything, I get bits and pieces of what I want from different people and I cling to that piece.&nbsp; I am not used to putting my life out there, but I just need to vent and since my friends dont seem to care enough about my issues to listen wholeheartedly without blurting in something of their own, I'll do this for today. I just re-read that last line and my people arent that heartless but I just dont express myself verbally that well, I guess because all of this would never come out in a conversation.&nbsp; But back to me being tired. I am so sick of being used. Yup that is what it is, I am being used by various people in my life. Relationships that I have are draining me emotionally and although I know this I am not getting rid of them.&nbsp; Stupid huh. But if I do that then I will be missing that piece that I loved some much.&nbsp; Maybe things will look up for the better eventually....just gotta keep pressing right???   Sorry for the venting but it kinda helped.....

       Now I know you are going to think that this is going to be about some equal rights for men and women and in a way I guess it is but not in sense that you are thinking.&nbsp; Being a woman I have come across many stereotypes but as of late this has been my biggest pet peeve.   GUYS THAT DON’T EAT THE COOTCHIE BUT EXPECT YOU TO GIVE THEM HEAD!!!!      What the hell???!!!!!!&nbsp; My gyrl came across this dude that had the audacity to tell her that he don’t eat cootchie but giving head is a prerequisite to have sex.&nbsp; Now this fool better be glad that he was talking to her and she was nice enough to indulge in the conversation because I would have had to end the convo right there.&nbsp; There would have been no need to further discuss it because sex would have no longer been an option for him from me.&nbsp; I can understand when couples don’t participate in oral relations period, I mean that isn’t something for everyone, but how dare you tell me that you don’t do but its required for me to in order to have sex with you??? Have you lost your freakin mind??? I am so tired of guys talking about, man that’s nasty…yeah like your salty mess taste like sugar..Or nah ya’ll be cumin all in my mouth…its better than getting squirted in the eye like ya’ll do to us…I mean come on now, we are all adults here, or at least you should be if you are participating in this type of activity, grow the fuck up!!!!! Do it and love it….or else your hand is the only action that dick is gonna see…Almost every gyrl requires tongue action nowadays, its just the way it works…    But on that note..I gotta hit up my LADIES…don’t expect no man to go down south and you acting to high and mighty to get on your knees…Just keepin’ it real here, because as I told you REALNESS&nbsp; is what I bring. Now I know you don’t want your gyrls to know because we know how us ladies like to talk but listen here sista, if you aint blowin your man believe me some other chica is…that’s just he way it works. Just remember that when he stops asking you to give it to him…    I am so tired of the b.s in this dating game. Just do you!!!! But be fair about your stuff, I mean don’t expect something from someone that you aren’t willing to do.&nbsp; If the person chooses to do it freely then that is different but don’t require it or set that expectation upon someone else if you aint willing to return the favor…..   &nbsp;

      How many ladies keep saying that they want a REAL man?  How many of ladies keep saying that they want a brotha that don’t play games??? How many of these very same ladies, play mind games??  I know a ton of hands were raised or at least some “I do” were said for the first 2 questions, but not many for the last.  But we all play mind games and because I am a lady I know this.   For the amateur’s who really don’t know much about mind games, I am sure you do something simple when you are trying to feel a guy out, like talk about other guys around him to see how he reacts, or act all non-chalant around him when you know that you are about to pee your pants because he called you.  Now, these are games you are playin because you aren’t keeping it real, and really how can we?  Guys heads blow up so quick, full of pride and that damn ego, that if we let them know that we are happy they called up the games quickly shifts into their favor and they start acting dumb, right??  So ladies, even if your game is at the amateur level, admit that it’s a game you are playing.  But don’t sleep, he is probably planning one too, so just make sure you stay on top of things.  This young lady usually can only handle talking to one guy at a time so therefore she puts all her eggs in one basket.  She is probably sweating dude behind closed doors but trying to save face in public.  Fellas beware of this young lady because more than likely she is really feelin you therefore gonna be truly scorned if things don’t work out.  Although that might not always be the case because not everyone can fit 1 profile.  Now its time for the intermediate level gamer…This is a lady that is beyond the simple games and they are starting to get a little more complex. She is probably talking to a few people always re-upping when one gets out of hand.  Her level of gaming is slightly more advanced than the novice previously described.  She had learned to be more calculating.  Letting a guy knows that she cares but not enough where he will think she is pressed, just enough to let him know that she is interested.  Because she has learned that if a brotha don’t think you are interested then he is going to bounce or get what he can and then bounce.  Ultimately, he is bouncing.  And that is not what she wants.  This gamer also has learned that a man wants a woman that can hold her own.  So she is getting her self established because not only does she want things in life, she knows that you can not ask of another what you don’t have yourself.  You see the difference between this sista and the novice is that she has learned, probably the hard way, the way men work.  Although she doesn’t know it all, she knows enough to know that when he leaves life goes on.  She doesn’t place all her eggs in one basket, maybe just 1 or 2.  She is more likely to catch feelings for one guy in particular but always giving the others enough attention to make them think they got her.  From her standpoint, men like to know they got you so she lets them think that. Her game isn’t bad at and she doesn’t really play obvious games, she is truly fuckin with your mind. Its hard to tell which guy she is truly feeling because she can be affectionate towards them all and her affection just might be genuine.  With this gamer she is trying to put the perfect man together by using multiple men.  This lady and her friends know that she plays games and will admit it to a few, but her rationale is that men play them too.  She doesn’t believe that she is the only gyrl that her “friends” are hollerin at so why should they be the only man.  She never uses titles and everyone is a “friend”.  Although she might have “friends” in her life, they all know their role and will promptly be dismissed if they try to step outside their boundaries.   Most women are on this level and are rather content about being there until they find that one that makes them changes.  Yes men, women are like you in many ways.  When we find someone to make us change our ways then we become the MASTER GAMER.  The master gamer is the experienced lady, who like the novice she once was, only uses her skillz on one man.  But she is very very different from the novice.  Because she has been through the ringer and knows how to detect a man that is worth her time and skill off the back.  There are many intricate parts to this lady.  She is more than likely established in her life.  Meaning that she knows what she wants and is in the process, if she hasn’t already, of getting her self where she wants to be.  She has played the love game several times and realizes that the only way to be real is to be real.  She has put all the games aside for the most part, I mean we never really stop playing games until we are comfortable with our choice.  That is the great thing about this gamer, she has perfected the game and knows that if you wont play by her rules there are others that will.  Knowing yourself and knowing what you are about is the key difference between a master gamer and the other levels.  She knows what she has time for, she knows what she is going to put up with and is content in her decisions.  She is not the type to ask her girls for opinions on her life decisions or her men choices.  She is the only one that is going to have live with them so why ask others opinions.  Her mentality is one that is very aware.  She can feel when she is getting played and will revert back to her old games just to get her point across to the man she is trying to make aware.  Her sole focus is on bettering herself and being a good woman to a good man.  But without going through the tolls and pains of the previous levels she would have never gotten to this point, where she is truly able to cherish and love a GOOD man.    Now how every woman plays her “game” is totally different and you might not be able to tell what level your woman is on.  Hell, some women don’t even know where they are.  You are not a master gamer simply because you claim to be good at the game.  You might just be a very good intermediate player.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Play your level and play it well.  But if you keep it real with no one else always be real to your self…

      I have always been one to give a second chance to those that deserve it.  I mean sometimes people made a honest mistake and need to be able to redeem themselves.  I know for a fact that I have screwed up on certain people and they have found it in their hearts to forgive me, so I should always extend the same courtesy to others.  But what about when someone does something real foul to you? Like steal from you or lie to you.  Even if the lie is warranted does that mean that you have to forgive them and give them a second chance?  Although I forgive friends and give them second chances...some of them are one their 100th chance, but who is counting :) When it comes to relationships, ie. guys...I dont give second chances.  I firmly believe that you shouldn't have screwed up in the first place.  First, time shame on you..second time shame on me.  But there has never been a second time for me.  I am only recently beginning to wonder if I have  passed alot of great men because I have never given them a second chance.  Take for instance my last boyfriend, that was 4 years ago. He went to Michigan to see some chick he met offline, now we live in VA, so that is not right around the corner.  Although we didnt break up when he first told me about it and he adamently denies doing anything with this broad, I never forgave him for it.  Eventually we broke up because as long as I could see him I was fine but when I went home for the summer, I couldnt see what he was doing and realized that I didnt trust him anymore.  I mean in no way am I bitter about it but what if I had just forgiven him and moved on, would we still be together?  We were very happy together but in the back of my mind I always was skeptical about him after that. The reason I am bringing this up is because I have a friend that has recently resurfaced in my life.  The first time around, I was younger and much more friskier than I am now and he wanted to take part in my frisky world.  Unforunately, I only get down with one person at a time and I was perfectly happy with the person I had at the time.  He told me I wasnt acting right and I cut him off.  We spent 3 1/2 hours talking today and we had a great conversation.  I can see that he has changed alot and grown up.  I think that he deserves a second chance in my life but that goes against all that I have followed for 23 years.  I believe that I should take things one day at a time and stop trying to pre-judge what he is after, that would be alot easier.  Maybe giving second chances isnt that bad after all....hey never know where things with me and this dude could lead...we could end up being great friends and everyone needs a few of those in their lives.

       Okay, I have for one been the biggest fan of long distance relationships. I am not the kind that feels the need to be up under my man all the time nor do I want him under me. Truth be told, I would probably rather be sleep. ( A sista does work long hard hours) I mean except for the occasional weekend rendevous, seeing each other periodically and speaking via internet/email at least once a day works for me. Besides with my busy work schedule plus my full time student schedule and any other events that I might have going on, I dont have time to hang out. So that is why I know that I am prime candidate for long distance relationships. However, (please note that is bold), I love sex. So this can cause a strain on that long distance relationship because I aint getting none. I mean I have gone for extended periods without sex but come on now a sista can only take so much. Right now I am looking at being on a drought until Thanksgiving. That is like 4 months away. Oh what is a gyrl to do..But I believe I can be faithful, in fact I know I can because I dont cheat. But really, not just for the physical things, can a relationship really last when your miles apart? Does absence really make the heart grow fonder or does it make the eyes wander? I guess only time will be able to tell.But after 4 years of not being in a committed relationship, I think I am going to give this a try. Although I have been in long distance relationships before they have never been this far away. I really can not see him until he goes on break, or if I fly out to Texas. Yes sir, I did say Texas. He is over there getting his education on and I am not mad at him for that, but I will miss him. While he is working, I will be too because along with my full schedule and work.I will have no time to have wandering eyes. If he does I will beat him down. But I believe that as long as we keep the lines of communication open, we should have no problem. Wish me luck!!!

       Lately things have been going okay for me.  I have been keeping my schedule busy and things are actually for once looking up for me in the school department.  Looks like I might get that degree anyhow.  But here comes a new revelation.  I DON’T get pressed over guys. I mean seriously what is the point, you will just be one in a billion right? But for some reason, I have to admit I am feelin kinda pressed on this guy I met at the club on Saturday.  I know I know….we met at the club but there was something about him that I cant get out of mind.  He has drawn me in like Curtis did and if you know me then you know about my addiction to Curtis.  I am just not sure where to put all this or where to place what happened.  But here is the story and you tell me what you think…  On Friday I was out at the hangout spot that my best friend and I have discovered.  It was poppin’ as it does when it gets late and there was this guy slowly grinding to this song.  I noticed and ran up and stuck my butt in his crotch area and then jumped out of his way.  He pulled me back to him and he started dancing with me.  I was not hooked then but the way that he was dancing could have gotten a girl hooked  I then kept my eye on him all night long.  Just because I was curious about his “action” like any young woman would be.  So he flirted and I flirted back, we danced some more but not that much.  At the end of the club plays 2 slow songs and he danced those songs with some big round girl but no love was lost. I just assumed that was his girl and the flirting we did earlier was all in fun and totally innocent.  Well after the club closed I got my girls to stick around and see the sites afterwards just in case there was some hotties that I may have missed, and although the sites proved to be worth it nothing compared to when he came over and chit chatted with his boys.  Seeing that the 2 were barely speaking I figured that they were mere acquantices and that if he did have a girl that was not her.  So after sitting outside of the club for nearly 1 ½ hours chillin and laughing at folks as they walked by, it was decided that him and his boys would meet me and my girls over at Dennys.  Well we went over to Denny’s and waited for them.  My fear was that we were being stood up and that was not cool at all but after about 15 minutes they arrived and were ready to eat.  So we went inside and had a ball.  We were on the verge of getting kicked out of Denny’s so we decided to call it a night and leave.  When it was time to pay, the cutey paid for everyone.  Now I was impressed, granted the bill wasn’t going to break anyone’s pockets but the simple fact that he paid for girls that he didn’t know was impressive to me and very sweet.  So here we are full and kickin it outside of Denny’s where me and Mark do some more flirting.  After about ½ hour of that our company is starting to get tired and we don’t want to be rude.  So we call it a night. We were cuddled up the whole time though.  So we get in our respective cars and off we go right? Wrong!!!!! No numbers were exchanged so my girls feel the need to get his number or have him get mine. This is where the complication comes in.  I think that if he wanted my number he would have asked right?  Well they feel like if I want it then I should go for it so they went for it for me. Now I don’t know if he is going to call or not. And I am wrecking my brain thinking about it.  I figure if he didn’t want the number then he should have just said he had a girl friend or something and bounced that way I wouldn’t be going through this.  Maybe he is going to call though, I mean we were all hugged up and stuff and he did pay for me and my friends so that has to mean something.  I hope I beat the odds on this one because for some odd reason I am feelin this one.
