       I can't stress enough how much I don't have plans.  -Xander, Buffy the Vampire Slayer  So, my last weekend of Summer has been summed up with one word. Nothing! I really don't have all that much to write, but I want to get into the habit of updating this as regularly as I can.  On Friday, I hung out with Sabrina and Jen. Had lunch at Harveys and went to Fairview. What began as a quick run in so Jen could get the Ink anti-theft dealy off her pants turned into an hour or so of cell phone shopping. Pretty funny that both Jen and Sabrina were both being hit on by the salesmen at two different departments. I think one of them(known as Shady)thought I was dating one of them, but wasn't sure which and didn't know which one to hit on, haha. It may have been a bit long, and I may or may not have complained(hehe)a bit, but I'd much rather hang out with cool people like Sabrina and Jen while we do something outside my tastes then do nothing except sit at home. Also headed to Tim Hortons, the flower shop so Jen could buy some flowers for Shawn, and the dollar store. Ooh, and another store, but I'm gonna pretend that never happened.  Saturday, I did nothing. Literally, I just sat and stared.  Today, I forced myself to wake up early after minimum sleep so I can actually get some sleep tonight. A summer of going to bed at 3 o'clock really fucks with a guys body clock.  So tommorow, I head to my first day of school via train. Waking up at 5:00 AM should be an experience. But I'm really looking forward to tommorow all in all. There's not much detail to go into past that, but don't worry kids! Expect a detailed review of tommorow.  She says it's Lack of Sex that's Bringing Me Down. 29 Days.  Signed, Zakky, The Vampire Slayer.

      So today, I had my John Abbott orientation session. I gotta say I'm rejuvinated about the thought of going to College again. The past few weeks, I've been thinking hard, going into professional theatre, wondering if this is really what I want. I've always known that College is a time where you figure out what you want by trying, which should seem like a positive thing right? I guess the reason I was so down about the whole thing, well, I was more concerned about keeping up with my friends in what they're doing. I suppose that's almost a twisted dependency. I just had the feeling that I didn't want to be left behind, but this isn't high school anymore. It's not about the class anymore, it's about the individual student.  The orientation wasn't anything worth dreading. In fact it was kinda fun, but I suppose it adds to the experience when you're hanging out with a friend as we make obnoxious jokes about the Dean and our creepy as hell tour guide! Me and Nachaj did the whole campus tour scene, got our student ID's and such. Good on Nachaj for pulling out his best "Gonna Rape Ya!" smile for his ID photo. Quite the load of people I ran into today also; James Cotnoir in the hallways. Christie at the pool as expected. Ran into Sonie, who introduced me to her boyfriend Vince. More Hudson kids in Vicki Pasaliqui, Paul Solnoky, Mike Doble, Ryan Ramage, Adam Buckman, all there as well. Ooh, The Zgeb was there too. He had a hawk. I miss my hawk:(.  Man, our agenda's such a whore. 270 pages and 170 of those pages are ad space. Oh well, tons of Subway coupons. Hey Myles, if I give you my coupons, can we call it even? Haha, don't worry, you'll get your 6 bucks.  I can't believe I did this, but I actually a club! No issue with clubs, just didn't expect to join one is all. I ended up signing up for Radio, which gets played through the campus or something. Expect my hour and a half to be filled with mucho Green Day. My fans will approve(yeah, both of them).  Kim and I will be splitting a locker this year, and we really lucked out with lockers right by the pool. By the way, all those who want to go through Kim's things, I'm selling our combo for a reasonable price;).  Haha, Absolutely Not.  The video for American Idiot played. I strongly approve. 32 Days.

       Hi, I should preface this writing by letting you know that I know nothing about anything.  -Flea, Red Hot Chili Peppers  Hello hello. I'm Zak, and you probobly knew that, seeing as if you're reading this, more then likely I personally linked you. Welcome to my brand sparkling new blog. After a few months of reading the blog of a friend(Hi Lilly!), I decided to start up my own, to post my thoughts for all to exploit!  If you're reading this, it means I finally got my blog working. When it didn't work, I lost my first blog which took me an hour to type. Hopefully I'll get it working. I'll ask a friend to help me get it working(Hi Lilly!). I'm going to try recapturing the magic of the original blog here, but forgive me if it's a lackluster. Know the song "Tribute" by Tenacious D? Think of this blog that way.  Anyway, seems the trendy thing to do with blogs is to talk about how life's going and such. So hey, here's the most recent excitement within the last few days in my own little world. Friday was a pretty awesome day, although it started out a bit rough. A few weeks back, I redid two french exams, hoping to pass and get my high school leaving, which I needed to get into John Abbott College(I plan on studying theatre, for those keeping score at home). Anyways, I passed one of them. The other I failed again, but it gave me the boost in mark I needed. Passed by the skin of my teeth with a 60.15. So, I had to go to the school and pick up a letter to bring to JAC. I was told to be there between 8:30 and 12:30, and I showed up at 11:30, but still, the place was closed! I originally gave whoever's in charge the benefit of the doubt, thinking maybe they're at lunch or something. Big mistake. I ended up waiting 40 minutes before I called in my dad to pick me up, and waited another 20 for him to show. Needless to say, I was pissed. Assholes.  The day got better though. In accordance to some plans we made, I went to the Hudson Youth Center to hang out with Lilly(maybe you've read her name somewhere, I dunno)at her work. That was awesome, cause I haven't seen her in over two years! Her task for today was to redo some english announcement posters in french(I should of helped, being such a wiz in french and such), but we still hung around, went to Sauve's for lunch across the street and such. Ran into Max too, as he was on the job watching some kids. I met Lill's friend Kate. She was cool. We all walked down to Sandy Beach, just chilled. Back at the Youth Center, Lilly kept making me listen to some music. All bands I've heard of, but haven't heard much from them, such as Franz Ferdinand. Pretty good stuff. I think I'll pick up their album. Oh, also found out in the two years I haven't seen her, Lillys become gal-pals with Avril Lavigne! Got a bit of a kick out of that, haha. All in all, it was fun seeing Lill again. Even if we were just stuck while she worked the whole time, it would of been just as fun, cause everything, conversations and such, were fresh, but familiar. We gotta hang out more often Lill!  How'd you go from Lindsay to the nickname Lilly anyway? Haha. I knew there was something I wanted to know but forgot to ask. Either way, you're rad!  On Saturday, I got to hang out with some of my best friends; Trev, Myles, Ian and Junkie(AKA Alex. No meaning behind the nickname). I haven't seen these kids almost all summer, seeing is I live farther then the middle of nowhere. It was awesome seeing them again. The only time I have is when I ran into Trev and Ian a month or so back at the theatres. So with Ian at the wheel we went to the theatres. Now, originally I wanted to see Alien vs Predator, but after seeing(and almost memorizing)the trailers, I figured something didn't add up. Come on, just do the math with me.  Predator = Rated R Alien = Rated R Predator + Alien = PG 13?  Yeah, that's just not right. Now I'm not "pro-violence" in movies, but I love the original Alien and Predator series's(is that the proper plural for series?), and I don't want a watered down version of them. When I see Predator, I expect decapitation, and when I see Alien, I expect bursted-chests. But hey, I'll reserve further judgement untill I see the movie. Instead we saw Collateral, which makes me 4/4 of the movies I've seen this summer. Spider Man 2 topped the original, I Robot was surprisingly good, Anchorman was the funniest movie in a long time, and Collateral keeps my streak going. The movie was smart, and well directed. Tom Cruise as a bad guy, that's just... neat. He played his character to a tee. Jamie Fox did great as his role also, but again, Tom Cruise definetly steals the show. I recommend Collateral to anyone who likes good movies.   Afterwards, we headed to McDonalds. I hate McDonalds, but thankfully I wasn't subjected to the cold fries. Thankfully Myles spotted me 6 bucks earliar to get a meatball sub at Subway and snuck it in for me, since my pockets were to small. However, showing up at McDonalds was totally worth it, cause Trev did the funniest thing I've seen all summer. We had a seat by the window, and I noticed someone pull in and park across two handicap spots. I point this out and we have a slight laugh about it. An old lady steps out. She didn't seem handicapped, unless she was too blind to see she parked across two spots. In that case, what the hell's she doing on the road? Anyways, Trev gets up and walks out of the buidling before the old lady can progress to the entrance. Trev(very politely might I add)points this out to her and asks her to move her vehicle. Somehow, the lady got offended or something, got in her car and drove away. We all had a good laugh about that. You would have to of been there, but still, hilairious stuff. The only thing that could of been funnier as Junkie pointed out is if the lady pepper-sprayed Trev. Even Trev would of been laughing, after he flushes it out of his eye. We got back to Trevs. Ian drove Alex and Myles home, but I had to wait around for my dad. Didn't wait long. Really fun night.  ---- This blog has since been updated before I got to post it. I might of gotten it online sooner, but yesterday(Sunday), I got angry with my computer and smashed my mouse in a few pieces. Heh, temper temper Zak! Today, I headed back to Macdonald High, and actually got my letter. I brought it to the registrars office at John Abbott. Looks like I'm finally back on track for higher education and all that jazz. I ran into Christie Conway at the pool, as she does lifeguard work there. It began a normal conversation, but I found out she's moving to New Jersey! She was originally going to, but then wasn't, and now she's going again! That's another one now on the growing list(Steph, Chantal, Jon). It sucks to see her go, but y'know I'm happy for her, and everyone else starting their new lives. I'm gonna be a high school nostalgic for the rest of my life.  I then went to Fairview mall to meet up with Heidi, but I had to show up way early, like 2 hours early because I had to take the bus(I think I'm the worlds most patient person). We ran into two of Heidis friends, who's names escape me right now. I also ran into other Hudson High survivors Kev Tolton, Mike Bush and Keith Lewtas. Never hung out with the guys but I liked seeing more Hudson kids. Purchases I made for all those who wanna know are a new backpack, a new computer mouse(I dunno why. I could of fixed the old one with a twig and some superglue. I'm like Macguyver, baby!)and the Franz Ferdinand album based on several recomendations and hearing it at the Teen Center with Lilly. After I ran out of all fifty bucks, Heidi and I ran to Toys R Us. Also checked out Nature, where she turned me bitter against all pet shops. Headed to Chapters next and checked out some comics, Calvin and Hobbes style. We found this mini-book with a bunch of different shot mixes with dirty names. Personal favourite: Slut Juice. I wish we wrote that mix down, that's just too good. Then waited at the bus terminal and eventually got on our buses. I love hanging out with Heidi. She's crazy in the good, fun way.  Got back to St Annes and waited for my ride home, and who should I see but my old high school friends, Nick, Steve, Matt and 2 others drive by. Oh high school... Anyways, awesome day, even though my legs hurt from walking too much.  Overall, a cool past couple days. Saw more familiar faces then I've seen all Summer.  I'll end this with a reminder to all. September 21st(35 Days away!), just north of a month from now, my favourite band(and should be yours too!),Green Day releases the new album, American Idiot! The single, also called American Idiot is currently playing on the radio. Also, August 18th, the video for American Idiot debuts on MTVu! But, I gotta ask, what the hell is MTVu? Be sure to hear the song, watch the video and pick up the album.   Untill next time, kids! Hopefully it won't be as long next time.  Your Friendly Neighborhood Zak Thriepland.
