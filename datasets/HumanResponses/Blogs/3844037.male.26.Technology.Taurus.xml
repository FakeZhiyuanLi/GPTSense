      Tired of the aches and pains from frenzied gaming ?  Wrists feel like they belong to a 90 year old ?  Looking for the ultimate in hand / gaming / godknows-what fashion styling ?  Try  urlLink [The Gaming Glove ]   Only 10 quid (plus international postage and packing)  ... Who on earth buys this stuff ? ... Oh wait I know someone who has hehe :P  (erm.. its not me btw .. i just bought a pointless  urlLink giant arcade controller  .. its a little more sane, if hellishly impractical [ although useful in a fight! ] :P )   [mRg]

      As a big fan of Transformers G1 and 3D animation in general I was shown this vid and loved it :¬)  So I pass it on to you .. the masses.    urlLink [Ch-ch-ch-check it out !]   Featuring: Shockwave and Rumble  I have no idea why they are using flash to stream it .. but its their choice so make sure you've got the plugin installed.  From a 3D / technical standpoint its got some fabulous motion capture wich makes up for the not-to-great rendering .. I wonder if they captured it themslves or got it from an example CD ?? . . either way its very good.   [mRg]

      Ever wonder what that great big hole is in the back of your PS2 ??   Now you found a use for it ...   urlLink ::[ HD Loader - Homepage ]::   w00t! A great little tool that looks very impressive. Pop in a HD and away you go !  Load the HD with a few games and you get reduced loading times and (hopefully) no need for a mod chip (experiment pending :¬)  I noticed lots of shops have sold out of the network adapter and it cant just be for FFXI (if you know what i mean .. wink wink nudge nudge)   urlLink [Unofficial PS-2 / HD Compatibility List]  - Check your HD is compaitible .. must be more than 40gb and less than 120gb .. Western Digital ones dont actually fit into the whole so avoid them like an long-coated man near a public toilet.  Watch this space for a update once I get it :¬P   [mRg]
