      First of all, i must really thank Aik Koon... Thank You for helping me to put up the tag board!!! Really owe you alot of favour... Thanks For everything!!! Really don't know how to express my gratitude to you!!! Oh man... Feel so guilty... *sob sob*  Hmm... Next... Felt so silly today... Woke up at 0500 to study Chemistry mock exam and left home at 0700, thinking that lesson starts at 0800... It actually starts at 0900! When i step into the school, i realised that there were every few people in school... Only those uniform groups... I was wondering, "where are all the people???"... I continued to climb the stairs and when i reached the class room, i then realised that i've got the wrong timing! Thank goodness there were also few blur souls in my class who also came at the wrong time... Some were earlier than me... But there is one advantage: i could use this extra hour to revise my Chemistry and chat with friends...  Its seems that today is specially meant of mock tests... Throughout the whole day we were having our mock tests... The Chemistry paper was tougher than it used to be... I'm so surprised that Mrs Teo would set such a paper... Or perhaps i didn't study hard... Die... Hope nothing wrong is going to happen to that paper... Next was Mathematics mock examination... Wonder which school's prelim paper it is... I find that the paper was a bit tougher but definately able to do... However, i have forgotten some of the methods to do the sums, making me abandoning it without getting any marks which i can score! In total, I've lost around 20 marks... Plus with my careless mistakes and wrong answer, i hope i could just get a C6... Don't ask for more...  Hmm... Just now when doing the paper, out of the blue, it starts raining... and don't know why, i felt my nose blocked... Trying to breath, i started to sniff hard, but in vain and produces noises... Sorry to disturb you guys... Well, half way through the paper, i felt my fingers getting colder... Rubbing my hands together to warm it, i stared at the paper trying to sole some sums mentally... Its so difficult to do that... Hope on that day when i am taking my O's, it will be like that anymore...  After the paper, my vision went blur... It seems that i have use too much of my concentration already... Furthurmore, i was very hungry... All this can't compared to Ling Feng... Her lips and finger tip starts to turn purple!!! She sais she felt very hungry and we rush to Burger King to have our lunch... On the way there, she commented that she would not talk for the moment... When asked why, she said she would wish to be like Ms Ho, who wears pink or purple lipstick everyday... Haha... Its still funny upon thinking of it... After eating the burger, her lips turn to red again... Felt so relieve after seeing that... Phew!  Think going to write till here... Tomorow have to attend a barbeque night held by my uncle... Why of all choose Sunday??? Sigh... Who knows??? Afterall i am not one of the people who pays for it, so can't give any comments... Ok... Shall sign off here...  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "Course Dumbledore trusts you. He's a trusting man, isn't he? Believes in second chances. But me -- i say there are spots that don't come off, Snape. Spots that never come off, know what i mean?" -Moody                                                                                  With love                                                                                  Louis

Hmm... Bascially nothing much to comment on... Just feel that i am very quiet today ba... Or the other way round??? Beats me... Hmm... That Jeremy... Keep disturbing me while we are on the way home... Really want to beat him up man... Kept staring at me for no eason when i am trying to fall asleep... Tomorrow he will get it!!! Got to revenge!!!

      Well, nothing interesting happen today... Basically, it's because of my mood i guess... Woke up late, felt enery lost out of sudden, difficult to tame my hair and other... Hmm... I'm also not sure why... But i am really sorry that i have shown my temper to Aisyha and Shi Kai and a few... Sorry guys...   Hmm... Well, let me see... Yes... During recess... There was this short plump guy commenting that Ling Feng was ugly... Hello??? Why don't you go and find a puddle pf water and see it yourself if you are good looking not??? If not, PLEASE don't make any comments bout the way people looks... In fact, you DON'T LOOK GOOD! Please don't think that you are handsome... YOU ARE NOT! Is good that people says that you look like Wilbur Pan... Don't be so shameless and claim that you look like Edison... PLEASE DON'T DESTROY HIS IMAGE!!! Incase you don't know, you are not popular in our class!!!  You also commented that i'm a sissy... LOOK!!! I'm just being able to befriend with girls better than guy... You call that sissy??? Please... This shows how ignorant you are and childish... So what if i am one? Besides, its none of your business! I live my own life... So the decision still lies with me... Why not talk bout you??? At least i am better than you in turns of size and character... I don't always make rude remarks of other and being BREADCRUMPS all the times... Whatever it is... I definately make it clear that i am not a sissy... This goes out to every single people...  So now proceed to Civil and Moral education... I've spent almost one period of time takign a nap while the class was watching the movie 'ohm bak'... i was awaken by the laughter of the class...   Next is the chemistry lesson... Hmm... It was ok... Except got to see some faces... Urgh.. Feel so sick... How i wish i could get out of this school as soon as possible!!! Finally, from next Chemistry lesson i won't be going to 4E3 any more! Yes!! but i've still got to see one's face in Phycis... Thanks goodness those people who sits around me also detest that person... Every Physics remedial enjoy critising that person... Haha...  Well... Now feeling very weird... No words could express what i am feeling now... Sorry Amamnda, i shouldnl't say all those things to you... Really.... Don't know why out of sudden have a kind of feeling that some one squeezed my hurt and it feel sour... i only have that feeling when something happen on the 19th of a certain month... But after that i no longer have that feeling already... Why it appears again??? *puzzled* i wouldn't want to fall into the terrible trap again... Never!!! Please give me energy and courage to prevent my self from falling!  That's all i've to say... Good night... Sorry to post it so late...

      Yea... Just came back from tuition... Feeling so guilty... We have made our tuitor cried... So sorry... It's not that we want a mass quiting.. It's just that the timing wasn't right! Furthermore you are leaving soon... We were already adapted to your teaching, jokes and etc. And now sep you flying off... What can we say??? Good for you! Study hard and play hard too! All the best... Seriously, i felt guilty and also sad... It's because you are leaving soon and we made you cried more then twice and i believed that it must be hard to deal with angeline... Sorry... Really... Hmm... Rest assured... I will definately remember your birthday! Haha... It's really nice of you to say that you always look forward for our class every Wednesday despite being a busy... I believed it must be our craziness that really makes you enjoy that lesson... Well, you will be leaving Singapore soon.. A month or so... Meaning we onli left with not more than five lessons to go... I believed you and the rest of us will definately cherished the time left...  Hmm... What happen this morning??? Let me see... Oh Well... Hmm... Got back Chemistry results... Hmm... To some it may be good... But to me, it's still lower than my expectations... Yea... Perhaps i didn't really study hard... Let's hope that this Saturday's Chemistry i will do well...   Oh yes... The Mathematics Quiz was tough!!! Oh man!!! What really makes me turn red with fury was that Mr Ang said that he can just don give us quiz as he also needs to spen alot of times preparing and marking it... Hello??? That's what you are supposed to do what... You chose to be a teacher... We didn't force you!!! Being a teacher Must have patience... But you don't! When being asked to explain the question second time, you started to get irritated!!! What's this??? Don't you know that different people have different speed of absorbing things into their brains??? Since you choose to take up this job, you should endure with us! Whatever!!!  So tired... Just reach home... Going to bath soon... Good night! Take care!!!

      What a day~! There are so many things to tell... Well let's start with the moment i stepped into school... When i reached school, someone came to me and told me that later in the afternoon will have a photo session. I was like "what the hell??? Mr Ang didn't even tell us!!! oh no!!! my hair!!!" Thank goodness Shi Kai brought his stick wax to school... The whole class eventually spent the whole day during lesson talking bout the photo taking session... I think its me and Aisyah who talk the most about it...   When the bell rang, signalling the end of the class of the day, we dashed out of the class room and went to the toilet and style our hair... When i came out of the fourth floor toilet, i looked down... Then i saw Kian Peng they all at the 2nd floor, first floor i believed dominated by Ivan they all and a few dominated the third floor... I was like " hey, now then i realised that my class 4E5 is the most vain class of all!!!" even my assistant monitress asked this:"did you guys practice smiling???" she was the least vain person i knew on earth and she eventually said that!  Well i am also surprised that i passeed my second mock exam! I never ever have the thought that i would pass it... Perhaps it was just a dream... But it will be a very nice one... Hehe... Better don't say anymore... Later people would critisise me again...  The next thing i am going to say is going to make me feel irritated and shameful... We (Gerald, Marianne and Ling Feng) were walking home, when sudden;y me and gerald got into a "fight"... He start messing ym hair and i tried to mess his hair for revenge... Then he started to run off and i start to give him a chase... After running for a few distant, i realised that i have landed onto the floor... I had slip and fall upon a puddle of water!!! Then i felt a very painful sensation starts dwelling aroung my knees... In stead of help me up , Gerald started to laugh and run off again! When i stood up, i saw white patches one my pants... I tried to use some water to wash it away, unfortunately it didn't came off... i believed that its worn out at the moment when i fall... Untill now, my knee cap and my wrist still hurts... Let's hope that nothing will go wrong with them or else there won't be any one who is able to help my mum!  Gerald!!! I swear that tomorrow you will get it from me!!! Thanks for nothing!!! To think i still treat you as my good friend yet you ran away and broke into laughter upon seeing me falling!!! You good!!! I'll remember this!!!  That's all... Got to rush off... If not my mum will be nagging again... See you guys tomorrow... Chiao!! Bye!! Good Day!!!  Ps:this reminder is for 4E5 puipls... There will be a D&T test tomorrow and a Phisics verbal test (what ever it is)...

      Hello there!!! Hee... Just return from school and i am writing my blog... The English mmock exam was tough, but its much easier than the previous one... Hope i will pass this paper... *fingers crossed* This year have been a very stressful year... My Design and Technology projectwork's date due is drawing nearer... Cannot make it... Thank googness it will be over in a few months time... Good Luck guys!!! Do the best that you can do! And may the Force be with you!  Just now in D&T room got scolded for nothing... i was being accused of wanting to drop my D&T... Hello!!! Can you please get a life??? Do i look as if i will drop my subjects so easily??? I just commented that i don't wish to doi it today and you go aroung telling the teachers that i want to give up??? Can you please go and dig you ears? please don't keep bragging and insult people's work will you? You are so ironic!!! You are hired as a workshop instructor to teach us how to handle sophisticated machines and help us with it, not to boss us around!!! Whatever it is, i am not going to depend on you... i am doing it myself and my own way...  What really makes my blood boils is when i got back my results for the Algebra quiz... Even though i just passed the papaer, however, i have made loads of careless mistakes!!! Argh!!! This is really fustrating!!! Seeing that you could get the marks but just because of some carelessness, you lost it, it really hurts!!! Moreover i didn't reached my teacher's expectation, meaning i have to retake the quiz tomorrow after school!!! Sigh... Tomorrow will be a boring day...  That's all folks!!! Good Day to you all!!!

      Well... I'm sorry that i did not update my blog for the 11th and the 12th... No time and due to cold war between my parents and i... I'll explain it later on...  Well on the 11th, actually my blog should be posted up... But due to the internet prob, i was unable to post my blog up... I wrote alot of things and was so fed up when i realisedd i can't post it up!!! Urgh... Well in the mean time of writing of my blog on that day, i was feeling mad... My mother just came back and suddenly beat me up... She complained that i've been using the computer every day and so forth... What ever... I'm so mad with her... So this is where the cold war started...  Well... Then on the 12th... Urgh... Bad day, bad day... Got back my Mother Tongue O Level results... Got a C6... Bad man... I'm very very disappointed with my results... My cousin got an A1 for that... Urgh... Upon hearing my results, my mum insulted me so badly... Urgh... I don't care... This war going to go on for weeks...  Now... Today's blog... Hmm... Saw my class photo... Well, badly taken... My formal photo look like a lutanic while my informal look like a vampire... Urgh... Sad man... Last year already... But my photo is so badly taken... Then after school, my friend and i went to take photo again... Well, again, i turn out to be vampire again... Haiz... Sad man... Destroy the whole picture...   Well, nothing much to comment already... Take care! Tata... See you in my next update!

      Hmm... Well... Nothing much happened... Except making some decisions... Yes... I was wondering of i'm out of the triangle not... Well, till now, i'm not sure either... Its really really complicated... How i wish i didn't make that decision in the earlier year... Its just so stupid... If i didn't make that decision, i won't land myself in this mess already... However, if i didn't make this deciion, i don't think i will grow... Really... In this triangle, i've learnt alot of things... Especially human... Well, i've learnt that not all people are as good as what they appear... Yes... Believe me... I've a taste of it and its not good... True... People would say that i deserve it... But hey, its my choice and i don't really need you all for comments!!! Yes... I really have to thanks these people as they make me grow stronger and more matured in handling this kind of things... Really... They also thought me things that i believe some of you will never learnt... Whatever it is, i hope that i will not step into another similar triangle... *finger crossed*   Well, i've really nothing to comment about today's activity... I also have to think about the drafts and storylines for the Fanfiction blog... Headache man... Too many things to handle... Yes... I was thinking if i'm going to continue to update my blog daily... Well, i'll try to make it a daily blog... But under some circumstances, i might not be able to write it daily... Like my Prelims... Which will be starting in the 14th of September... Urgh... So fast... Well, secondary 4 live is like that... Hope next year arrive early! Like that i would be able to work, buy new clothes, and make over! Yes! These will be the first thing i'm going to do after O Level...   Well... That's all i'm going to write... See you tomorrow!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "Scars can come in handy.

      Well, here to write my blog again... Hmm... First thing first... the Harry Potter fanfiction blog have been changed to www.secrets-of-hogwarts.blogspot.com... Please take note of it... Well... Can't believe it... Syamimi and i had wasted almost 2 hours thinking and discussing the name for the blog... We really had a good laugh and fun though...   Hmm... The National Day Parade this year is really very plain... Nothing special... Everything were sort of boring except the fireworks, the community singing and the parade it self... I love the parade... Seeing all those contingents marching uniformly and looking proud, it really makes me kind of wanting to join them...   Well, next is the Singapore Idol... Oh man... I really have lots of comments about it... Gee... I kind of think that Singaporeans' skin are made of elephant skin... Compare to American Idol, our standrad were really very low... I mean those people who got rejected form America Idol, they at least have some standard. But as for those people who got rejected, they were really bad... Now here comes this Ricky, the Shang Hai guy who came to Singapore and sing... Wow... That's really a surprise to me... He can sing well, but only suits in opera, not hip hop... His pitch is way to high up... I believe it will never go down... Next is the stripist... That guy was damn gross... Really... I mean if he have the build, showing it is ok... But he don't! Oh man... I was eating and i nearly choke when i when i saw him striping... Yew... Its damn gross... Then that guy who sang the lemon tree... Well, that guy i really no comment... Speechless... Well... Wednessday we've another episode of Singapore... Haha... Preparing to have a good laugh... Yes...  Well... That's all for today... Take care people... Tomorrow got to go back to school...

      Yea... As you can see the title, its boring in the day and exciting in the night... Well in the morning, have to wake early to go to tuition... Have to drg my lazy bones all the way to Tampinese... Then when doing Mathematics, I asked my teacher to teach me completing the square... In the end we end up doing some question form A Maths sum... so we spent the whole two hours on doing around 6 to 8 A Mathematics sum... However, i've learnt quite alot... Not only know how to slove it, but also know how to use it to determine is the graph i'm going to plot is right or not...  Well, let's not say about the afternoon... Nothing much... Spend most of the time watching television, sitting in my parents shop doing nothing except feeding the mosquito... Those irritating blood suckers... One day hope some one will create a machine that will exterminate the whole of mosquito...   Hmm... Here comes night... Well, nothing much either... Until the open field opposite my house estate... They were celebrating and couinting down for tomorrow's National day... Out of curiosity, my mother and i approached the open field and soon, we saw people of all ages wearing red looking enthusastically up the stages, as thoough there are gold bars up there... When we walk towards the side of the stage, we spotted Mark Lee... He was one of the master of ceremony!!! He's so skinny!!! Haha... Well, i was attracted to their magic and illusion performance... Its Fabulous!!! Yesh!!! Well, i can only watch it half way when my mother complained that her leg aches... Urgh!!! She's always like that... But never mind who ask her to be the queen in my family...  Well, till now i'm still able to hear the screaming of the people... Haha... Guess i won't be able to have a good night sleep afterall... Well, I'll be writing till here... So long people!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "You're a prefect? Oh Ronnie!That's everyone in the family!" [Molly Weasely] "What are Fred and I?

      Hmm... Speaking of the celebration, i'm quite disappointed with it. I thought the concert would be fun but it turn out to be very boring... Yes... BORING! THere nothing much and nothing special to bring the atmosphere up... It wasn't the celebrtion i dreamt of... Really  really bad... Next, I'm so fed up that Mrs Lee went up to the stage and scolded the Master of Ceremony. I mean if their performance was bad, she shouldn't scold them infront of all the people! Its really very hurtful to get shame by our principle, and its worst when she shames you infront of every single pupils!  Next, the fun fair... Its completely lame... Nothing much to play or buy... First, went to the haunted house II, thinking that it will be really scary but never expected that we went out of the house laughing heartily... When we enter the room, Wen Long starts screaming ( he was just pretending to )... I can't help but keep laughing loudly when i heard his screaming and the "ghosts"... Haha... Well, their make up were kind of good but it just don't scare us out of our wit... Not sure why, but it doesn't leaves me a very strong impression...  Finally, after school, we went to Ling Feng's house and changed to civilian clothes and prepare to went out and play pool... Yes... Finally... This is the onli event that i enjoyed most today... THere were alot of people in there and we had to wait for long hours before we could actually play... The game that i remembered most is the one that i've playeed with Jonathan... Yes... Its a game well played... If its not for him (he hit my striped ball with the white ones accidentally, causing two of it to fell into the hole), he might win me... Yes... Thanks Jon...  Another person to thank... Marianne, She paid for the expenditure we've spent on one table... I believed it's expensive... Really thanks alot... Yes... Well, after the game, its really very tiring... I dozed off in the bus immediately... Thank goodness i didn't miss my stop... Haha... Any way, i really enjoyed the game very much... Hope we can play it again...   That's all i've got to write... Been a tiring day... *Yawn* Take care folks!

      Yes! Tomorrow is the day i'm waiting for! Natiional day celebration in school! Hope tomorrow's event will be make me go wild! Yea... For the past three years' national day celebration, i have been helping out in setting up the stores and misses all three concert so far... And since we don't need to be involved in the fund raising, this gives me an opportunity to have fun...  Hope tomorrow there won't be any one to dampen my mood to enjoy the celebrations... Breadcrumps, please stay away from me!  Yes... That's all i've got to say... Due to the fact that i need to turn in early as i'm not feeling very well... Yes... Take care people...

      Nothing much happen in school today, except one... Maths Quiz... Urgh... Can't teacher just give us a break??? He's going to use tomorrow's Civil and Moral education to give us more quiz!!! Oh man... DOn't know why, every time after i've finished his test, i would feel giddy... As if it will suck all my energy away...  Hmm... Next... I've created a new blog!!! Hee... Legalablative-hpstories.blogspot.com... Its a blog for Harry Potter fanfiction... Yea... Syamimi and i will be writing stories bout all the characeters in the HP world... Hope you guys will like it... The template would be something like light brown... To me it resembles parchments used in the Harry Potter world... So i decided to choose it... However, if Syamimi disagrees to it, i will changed it...   Hmm... Just know also helped Marianne to carry the art workpiece home... Phew! That's heavy! But i will just treat it as building up my bicepts... Haha... Have lots of fun during the journey to her place... Especially singing while we walk...   Hmm... I believe this is where i'm going to end today's blog... Good Day! Tata!  Quote of the day (From Harry Potter): "Why were you lurking under our window?" "Yes--yes, good point Petunia!

      Hey... Today i am so pissed off with almost single one... Whatever... I'm not going to care about who ever is going to see me as... As i said pervious in my blog, i do things my way... I'm starting to think that friends are really nothing anymore... Why? I don't know...  First things first... If any one want to come and scold me, please come and talk to the people who are involved... Its so simple for people to change his or her story to his or her own advantage... Didn't you guys study History or at least Social Studies??? THe most basic thing is not to rely on one source as it might be biased and at least compare two sources if it matches or contridict! Don't give people faces to see upon hearing ones complain ok... This what i hate most... Not refering to any one here but i believe everyone would experienced it before... TO ALL: DON'T JUMP INTO CONCLUSION WITHOUT DIGGING OUT THE EVIDENCE!!!  Next thing... If you guys are unable to take my jokes or what so ever, Just speak up. At most i will be serious with you if you can't take it... Don't go complaining to other people... Yea, i know my reputation is bad in this school, so??? I don't care! Be it i am childish or what, i still think what i've done is right...    Know what??? I'm wondering, since you guys are so unhappy with me, why don't you say??? I believe you guys are really desperate to tell me... Why not??? Any way, its not going to kill me or what... Let me think... PErhaps from now on, i would be serious to every single one except Shi Kai and Aisyah... At least they could stand it and did not take any offence out of it.... Speaking of them, i really enjoys chatting and joking with them... We do not have limits to everything... Especially jokes... We don't always fight with one another and you know, we get along quite well... In fact, better than some of my friends whom i know since secondary one or two...  Shi kai is my friend for around 3 years plus... We've been studyign int eh same class since secondary one... We don't really talk to each other till this year... My first impression is that he is a proud guy... (as i've said, looks might be deceiving...) Really regretted that didn't know him since secondary one... Well, he always seems to be a guy without any temper... Everytime we will keep insulting him but he just won't show his temper!!! He is really damn good!!! Enjoy sitting infront of him... Yea...  Next is Aisyah... Yea... Another crazy girl... Haha... Appear to be wild, but not... Haha... However, she is well know for being very very vain... She jokes alot and can say is the joker among the three of us... Some time really admire her alot... How can she still be happy when she failed her paper at times??? I don't really understand this... But i'm quite greatful that she didn't show her black face to us...   Hmm... There are still lots of stuff to type it out, however i've little time to talk about it... Yes... I will end here... Take care!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "You might even have a scar now, if you're lucky... That's what you want, isn't it?" -Harry to Ron  Love Louis

      Hmm... This blog might sound sad because of the title, but don't be decieved by it! Haha... What a wonderful day... Hmm... I've made some important decisions today which may affect my character in future...  Hmm... Let see... Well, last time i would consider my friends as my top priority... I'm sorry to say but its now between second or third... Its my family that's is really important to me now... They need me and vice versal... True, you might think that its normal that everyone treats their families as top priority... But not me... I'm just abnormal... I'm a very negative thinking person and imagine all those people who don't... Well, that's me!  And from now on, i'll no longer tolerating other people's temper... I believed its time for me to show mine... Yea... That's right... So sorry, but i am really frustrated with the life i've not... What's more when i am going to take this major exam, every problem came out... I'm just a fifteen year old teenager, and i don't think i deserve this kind of treatment while most of the teenagers out there are having fun... I really wished that i was born to a rich family where by i can have things i want and live life without worries... Yea... But too bad... I was born to the opposite kind of family that i want... Still, they are the ones who brought me up and continue to give me education when they were in financial crisis... Though i kept demanding for money to buy some things which were not really important to me at the time when they were not earning much, they would still gave in and give me the money... I still remembered that it was my 13th birthday, when i received a call from my parent saying that they might not be able to celebrate my birthday as they have to work longer to earn more money.  Feeling disappointed, i put down the phone and went to bad early... Soon i was in the dream land when a sudden jerk woke me up... It was around 2300 when my mother wake me out, one hand holding my birthday cake. I was so surprised that they would buy one for me... I was so touched when they said that they came back late so as to earn more money to buy my cake... Though its small, but it is definately one of the sweetest things they had given me..   Thinking of that, i felt really stupid... I actually took them for granted, finding them very naggy this days and all sorts of things... From now on i promised that i would treasure them really really well...  As for friends, i do realised that my past thinkings were not totally right... Yes, friends are important, but it got to depend on what type of friend you have... As for me, its a combination of good and bad, with temper and without... All sorts... What i prefer to be my good friends is those who are able to tolerate with me and don't have temper at all or at least seldom show it to others!!! Yea... One good example is Pin Wen... He is really a good guy to be friend with... Really, i am really honoured to have him as my friends...  Well, maybe i will continue this blog tomorrow, or i might changed to other if i realised that there is nothing left much to elaborate... One things... Whatever i am going to do to those people whom i detest, i'm not going to go easy on them... I honestly hope that i would not see you guys again after graduateed from this school!!! Take it as a cursing if you guys want... But normally what i've cursed would come through... Probility of coming true is 2/3... So don't mess with me!!!  That's all i've got to say... Yea... Have a nice evening and sweet dreams!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "There you go, Harry! You won't being thinck after all -- You were just showing moral fiber!"  Love Louis

      Wow!!! Just come back form the pit... Hmm... One word to describe it.. It's fabulous!!! Yea man!!! Really enjoiy it... Hehe... Though it had rain twice, it didn't dampen our mood!!! We even barbeque with umbrella covering the rain!!! This remind me of the npcc Bbq pit... Its was raining heavily but we still barbeque! We tied the tents for camp to the trees which servers as a shelter for us to bbq... There were so many people that every one were shoulder to shoulder in the "shelter" there were so much fun...  Just now we spent most of the time joking and telling dirty jokes... To our surprise, My cousin who is just only primary 4, able to tell dirty jokes better then we do!!! Oh man... This show's how polluted the younger generations are... Haha...  Out of a sudden, we heard something defening... We turned and saw fireworks lighting up the skys!!! A few of us, without any hesitation, run towards the place where it was released... By the time we were able to see the sky ckearly, we only managed to catch a few glimps of it before it stops...  Feeling disappointed, we ran back to the pit and continues to barbeque again... After going to the beach, i felt my mood settled down already... Quite good now... Hope by tommorrow morning i would be able to recover... But if i fall sick also good, like that i wouldn't need to go to school and take English mock examination... Hehe... So bad...   Ok... Shall end here now... Good day!!!  Love Louis

I can one just know me down and let me lost my memories??? I want to start afresh... Definately some one would say i selfish... If really got all my memories got erased, i would forgot my friends as well... Sigh... Then??? Can some one tell me what can i do???   I think i would just keep myself busy and forget everything...

Down with flu, dreamt of that person... Bad day Bad day... Thought its over... But its not... Sigh... Now i will have to practice to resist temptation already... Hope i can do it... *cross fingers*  Having sore throat too... How i wish that person was there to take care of me and shower me with whatever i need... But its over... One moment of irrational thinking leads to this, making me so regretted with what i've done... But whatever has done is done... No point turning back time... Even if some one told you the profecy of yours, you still won't be able to edit it... You will just merely delayed it... It will still happen to you.. Sigh... What a day!!!
