      From a conversation i had with Dave about my dream last night:  we were driving in the Geo got cut off by a cop car and fire truck all kinds of stuff,  they yelled at us to just stay still and not move i jumped in the back seat, then I saw a guy on top of Allens but it was like a fun house, so I got in the back seat or something we were all freaked out just sittin there and then the guy on top of the building actually had a sniper rifle,  I was looking at the back of your head and then I just saw a spray of blood and you moaned then slumped over and all this blood just leaked out of your head all over the place and I was freaking out and then I woke up.  I don't dream very much but when I do it is usually very disturbing, I actually had another dream last night as well but I pretty much just got shot in the back twice and it hurt really bad when I woke up. &nbsp;

      I saw One Cent Stamp last night it was enjoyable because the back-up guitarist used my amp, i'm getting a Seymour Duncan Sh-10 Full Shred Humbucker pickup for my guitar, it will be about $80 and One Cent Stamps guitarist is going to install it for me and teach me how to do it for future reference, it will be very enjoyable and my guitar will even more stimulating, Hi Allison.

      Me and my friend Dave went to an old abandoned Polygamists house a while ago it was creepy.&nbsp; It's just up on this hill in the middle of nowhere out in Mapleton, I have no idea why it's empty doesn't make any sense.&nbsp; It was obviously built in the 1970's but whatever.&nbsp; After that we went and got Ben and just watched the lightning and stuff Lightning is way cool I love it.&nbsp; Today I got hired at Teleperformance USA in Orem.&nbsp; I'll be a Telemarketer, but i'll get $7.75 an hour that is very enjoyable I will be filthy rich.   &nbsp;I recommend these&nbsp;web pages  urlLink justiceforkurt.com  ,  urlLink www.audioslave.com ,  urlLink www.aperfectcircle.com ,  urlLink www.primussucks.com ,  urlLink www.toolband.com
