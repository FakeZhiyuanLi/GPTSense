      just watched that movie.  It was powerful, but I just hope I don't remember it as being as disturbing as it was.  The complete lack of authority figures hit home.  They've earned the adult's trust on the guise of keeping them happy with the hope of a future job and lifestyle.  I'll need to balance that out with something fluffy tomorrow.  How am i going to sleep tonight?

      Do most first entries begin with the author stating she doesn't know what to write, she found this site by mistake and she just curious?  Shall I begin in such a fashion?    It's Sunday afternoon.  I'm dreading going to work tomorrow, as it's going to be more of the same.  I'm an IT drone at the 3rd largest telecom, who recently was purchased by the 2nd largest telecom.  Dare I say the name?  Surely no one is looking  :)  Good old AT&T Wireless will be usurped by Cingular end of 3rd/beginning of fourth quarter.  Good for the AWS customers (amazing service footprint), most likely negative for the employees.  For now, the management is making decisions regarding project based on making a roi by the end of the year.  Can I blame them?  Not enough information.  Can the lack of decision making suck all the life out of me?  Heck yeah.  Last week, I got a balloon.  For those who know wireless, that means one of my peers nominated me for a spirit of excellence award.  It's one of those programs where they narrow the participants with different award levels until the final 300 get to go to hawaii on company time and company dollars.  It's a sought after trip.  This is my fourth nomination in my 3 years and 3 months with the company.  Each time I've watched not the peon nominees, like myself, win the sought after trip.  It's our managers.  I like them all, and am glad we make them look good, but that doesn't make me feel as if I have a chance.  Heck, they're selling the flipin' company anyway, why do they even try?  May 19th is my birthday.  I'm not interested in turning 26 this year.  Not that I'm interested in the alternative.... just planning to let the day pass by without fanfare.  There rarely is fanfare anyway, I keep to myself up here.  I was recruited upon graduating from college at Oregon State, and my circle of friends scattered.   There have been more friends to supplement activities in my free time, but none of them as close as who I had in college.  When people get married and start having kids, priorities change.  The set of activities you do when single differs significantly to what you're interested in when you're married.  This should be a tangent for another day.  Want to also mention that I've recently taken up running.  If I actually write in this medium once and a while, I think you'll notice that I tend towards solitary activities.  Running is a good one for this, as I'm slow.  Thinking deep thoughts is interesting and finding shapes in the clouds is one of my favorite activities.  Look!  A kitty!  Good night and good luck.
