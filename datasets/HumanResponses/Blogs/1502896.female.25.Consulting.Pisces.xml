      Apparently, the "evil" Jewish plot "revealed" in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion is to "keep the masses under firm control through an efficient government that will banish unemployment, apply taxations in proportion to wealth, encourage small business, and promote education." ( Blood in the Face , James Ridgeway)  Zuh?  Are these guys still around, and do they have a presidential candidate I can vote for?    From  urlLink Andrew O'Hagan's review  of the two new Eminem bios: "When Hailie gets old enough," said Eminem in an interview [about songs in which he has fantasized about killing his wife], "I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that mommy and daddy weren't getting on at the time. None of it was to be taken literally. Although, at the time, I wanted to fuckin' do it."  What?  How is it not to be taken literally if you actually did want to do it, Marshall?  I think Eminem gets too much credit from liberals because he pisses the  urlLink right   urlLink people  off.  I'm not ready to jump on the Eminem boycott bandwagon yet, but this "It's just music -- don't take it so seriously!" excuse just seems dumb to me.  So, yesterday I hear someone behind me in the elevator say, "You dropped this," and I turned around, and he was holding a piece of asparagus.  I thought it was some kind of weird joke, so I laughed and turned back around.  This morning, though, I found a piece of asparagus in my purse.  I'm so confused!  Where the hell did that asparagus come from, and when exactly did it end up in my purse?  Did I have two peices of asparagus in my purse, and drop one in the elevator, and then find the other one today?  Did I have one peice, which I dropped and which the guy in the elevator replaced without my noticing?  Or did the guy in the elevator put the peice of asparagus he had in my purse, for some unfathomable reason?  If I really did drop that asparagus, that guy must have thought I was pretending that it wasn't mine when he tried to give it back to me.  Dur.  I'm actually sort of alarmed by this.  Asparagus is not the sort of thing that should be materializing inexplicably among your personal effects.  Right now I love: The 50% after 4 pm bake sale at ABP.  Thank you, Matt Fullerton.

      Holy crap, the dentist depresses me.  I went back again today, and read an article about online dating in the waiting room that was also very depressing.  For a minute there I was sitting in the dentist chair feeling sure that all my teeth were going to fall out soon and that I'd be alone forever.  Fortunately, right at that moment I noticed I had a bib on, and you can't help but laugh at yourself when you're in a bib.  I was in a really good mood today, because I got  urlLink The Work of Director Spike Jonze  in the mail from Netflix.   I love good music videos so much, and I had no idea how many of the great ones Jonze was responsible for.  (Watching Sabotage made me think that I wouldn't have hated Kill Bill so much if it had been a music video.    I usually really like anything that's both a parody and an homage, but seriously Quentin, three hours?  Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  You like Kung Fu movies, but you know you're smarter and more talented than the people who make them.  We get it.)  In the commentary to "It's Oh So Quiet" Bjork talks in her soft, odd, Bjork way about how excitable and cool Jonze is, and it makes me like them both even more, if that's possible.  As gravy, I'd never heard either Fatlip or Pharcyde until I saw the videos Jonze made for them.  Thank you, Spike.  From  urlLink one of the articles  in the  urlLink NY Review of Books ' 40th anniversary issue: "Walter Cronkite used to sign off his nightly CBS television news show by saying, 'And that's the way it is....' I once heard Senator Eugene McCarthy say he always wanted to reply, 'No, Walter, that's not the way it is at all.'"  Reminds me of thoughts that have been running through my head recently about The Truth, and its slipperiness.  I'm totally over my college breakup with absolute moral truth, and if you believe in absolute historical truth I've got a brige to sell you, but recently I've noticed that I can't even get a handle on the truth about things that I lived through.  Where you stand has such an effect on what you see, I realized when talking to the girls of '06 about this summer.  Creepy to think that I have only the ffoggiest idea of what's happening in my own life and why.  (Also, I wonder if forgetful people are more likely to end up moral relativists?  I mean, if you can't remember 90% of what happens to you, of course the truth seems slippery.  Exhibit one: me.  Exhibit two: Yoni Schneller.)  Right now I love:  urlLink "What's Up Fatlip?"   Bonus points if you can guess which verse reminds me of  urlLink Ed .

      I've been going to the dentist a lot lately, because I have a new dentist who's predicting oral apocalypse unless I get hours and hours of work done and drastically change my lifestyle.  No more Diet Coke!  Apparently my old dentist was sugar coating the truth.  He'd look at my teeth for five minutes, tell me everything was fine, and send me on my way.  Man, that was great.  Not so good for my teeth, though.  My new dentist is really mean.  He doesn't have a receptionist, so he leaves me with a mouthfull of pointy instruments to go talk on the phone for 10 minutes at a time.   When he gives me a shot, he doesn't bother to go slow so that the novacaine starts to work before the needle gets really deep.  Every time I leave his office I'm incredibly depressed for, like, hours, because he's so fucking grim about my dental future.  He seems really competent, though, I think in part because he doesn't give a crap about my feelings.  He's like the NyQuil of dentists -- his unpleasantness makes him seem effective.     urlLink   I went to the drag queen  urlLink High Heel Race  last night, and it was great.   We got there late, so we were at the back of the crowd, and it was raining, so all we really saw during the race were elaborate feathered headdresses bobbing above umbrellas.  The headdresses moved REALLY fast, given that they were on top of people wearing high heels.  Afterwards we walked around the crowd and saw all the different costumes.  Princess Di was the best.  This was my first drag queen event, and I really regret that I haven't spent more of my life up to this point with drag queens.  They're so happy and friendly.  I'm definitely going to have to hit up  urlLink drag queen bingo  some Tuesday night.  Right now I love: Anything soft, sad and sweet by Yo La Tengo.  Right now I'm filled with fiendish glee by: The idea of Margaret Cho, Jack Black, Gus Van Sant, James Carville and Antonio from "Wings"  urlLink teaming up to stick it to GWB .

      So, I'm thinking of being a  urlLink hipster  for Halloween.  I've become kind of obsessed with them since I left NY.   They're annoyingly omnipresent in The City, but there's an alarming lack of them in DC.  Four years at Princeton convinced me that the presence of hipsters is a good measure of whether people in a community want to be unique.  I'm not saying hipsters are unique, but they clearly think it's really important to try, and that's healthy.   Also, a lot of  urlLink the things they like  turn out to be  urlLink really great .  I picked up a few  urlLink hipster affectiations  myself, I liked 'em so much.  Last but not least, I love the lack-of-pose pose.  It's tricky, and often very entertaining to observe for amateur anthropologists such as myself.    Anyway, I got the ol' school Chucks already, and I'm sure I can scrounge up some Lisa Loeb glasses and a messenger bag.   Anyone have any more suggestions?  Do hipster girls wear lots of eyeliner?  I vaguely remember that, but I'm not sure, and I can't observe them in their  urlLink natural habitat  as easily anymore.  I should probably stop washing my hair today.  Right now I love:  urlLink John Dolan , who shot to the top of the Anna's Friends Rankings with his October 27 post.  I always knew that kid was exceptionally perceptive.  Right now I'm looking forward to: Thanksgiving, and the  urlLink High Heel Race .

      So, I've been thinking about going back to teaching.  This is kind of a strange thought to be rattling around in my head, given how loudly miserable I was when I actually was a teacher.  Apparently, every time anyone who knows me hears someone say they're thinking about being a teacher, they're all, "You  have  to talk to my friend Anna.  She did Teach for America, and she  hated  it."  I never know what to say to people who are referred to me like that, because I did, but I also didn't.   urlLink    It made me miserable, yes.  Kids are often unreasonable, bratty creatures.  (Check out the expressions on the faces of the ones on the left.  That was my favorite class.)  Teaching is very, very difficult to do well, and it's hard to live with yourself if you're doing a mediocre job.  Teachers do not get the respect they deserve, from their students, their employers, or the world at large.  On the other hand, teaching is so much more interesting and rewarding than having a cubicle job, even though I have a relatively great cubicle job.  I get to do interesting research, and it's research that helps the world, but in a tangential, insignificant way.  There are a thousand bright, eager recent college graduates who would love to have my job, and who would do it just about as well as I do.  I'm pretty sure that whoever replaced me when I left teaching won't be as good as I would have been if I'd stayed.  Plus, sitting in a cubicle all day isn't the dream life I thought it would be when I was storming through the halls of I.S. 164 muttering to myself about Manuel Sufran.   I don't know if I'm built for eight hours a day of self-directed googling and writing.  All of the great things about teaching are suddenly very clear and compelling to me.  You have a significant impact on a very important problem.  It's great to feel like you really need to get up in the morning and go to work, because what you do matters.  Teachers get enormous latitude for creativity.  You get to pick the things you really love talking about, and then you spend all day talking about them, and trying to get other people to love them, too.  I could live in any city I wanted to, if I were a teacher.   I think teaching needs people like me -- I'm so much more cynical than most of the hug-and-share-and-learn-and-grow types that gravitate towards education.    So I ask those of you who know me, am I crazy?  Is this nostalgia-induced insanity?  I'd definitely be signing up for some more misery if I went back to preach in the church of knowledge.  I guess I just have to figure out if it's worth it.  Right now I love:  urlLink Mark Ruffalo  and Born at the Right Time, by Paul Simon.  Thanks, Maddie and Emily.  Right now I miss: Ben, who I know would be talking me off this particular ledge.

       urlLink    So we partied last night.  People ate cupcakes, although not nearly as many as would have been eaten at a party populated by 30 Annas.  (Those are the  leftovers  on the right.  Good god, that's a lot of cupcakes.)   I rediscovered my old friend LEG, who is tremendous, in all senses of the word.  We drank a lot of tequila together and discussed our recent dating history.  Nick Boyle frosted his name onto a cupcake and then hid it in the closet.  Someone programmed their own number into Leota's phone under the name "booty call."  Various boys said extremely stupid things to my roommates which proved to be pretty funny in retrospect.   We went out dancing, and they played BOTH of the new Outkast songs.  In short, in the parlance of the  urlLink PDP , a good time was had by all.        urlLink        urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink         urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink        Right now I love: LEG, and that scene in Rushmore where Max gives Blume his punctuality medal.  Suddenly speaking to me:  The Satanic Verses  - "When he left Baal at the Curtain, he embraced the poet, kissed him on both cheeks and said: 'Maybe you're right.  Maybe it's better to keep out of the daylight.  I hope it lasts.'  Baal replied: 'And I hope you find home, and that there is something there to love.'  Salman's face went blank.  He opened his mouth, shut it again, and left."

      Leota, Megan and I are having a housewarming party.  Party planning is stressful.  Fortunately, this is going to be a very Anna party.  For example, we're going to have a frost-your-own-cupcake bar.  I've baked 118 cupcakes!  I spent $30 on frosting alone!  All my personal cupcake records, which were nothing to sneeze at, have been shattered.  If nothing else, this party will answer all the cupcake-related questions that have always plagued me: How many cupcakes does the average, slightly drunk 20-something eat in one night?  What percent of 118 cupcakes can Megan and I consume unaided?  Is it possible to get icing out of carpet fibers after it's been ground in and left to sit overnight?  Right now I love: James K. Polk by They Might Be Giants.  Thanks, Ed.  Right now I miss:  All my peeps in NY who can't come to my party.

      Megan and I went to happy hour at Front Page last night, and it was a triumph of an evening, as long as you consider spilling cheese in a stranger's hair and not talking to anyone else a triumph.  Which I do.  Anyway, when I got home, I decided it would be a good idea to go jogging, despite the fact that I was still kinda tipsy.  Do you ever know something must be a bad idea, because it just  sounds  stupid, but you do it anyway because you can't put your finger on what exactly makes it stupid?  I do that a lot.  I actually kind of like that about myself, but sometimes, shockingly, it leads to disaster.    In this case, the disaster was me twisting my ankle when I was about a mile from home, and then walking home anyway, because that sweet, sweet Corona dulled my pain enough to convince me I wasn't really hurt.  When I woke up this morning, though, I couldn't walk.  D'oh.  Now I look more than ever like Ol' Man Utgoff, hobbling around DC in my baggy overcoat, complaining about the cold and squinting at things (because I'm usually too lazy to put my contacts in these days).  Luckily, Megan heard me hopping around this morning and insisted on driving me to CVS for an Ace bandage.  My plan was to ignore it, hopefully doing permanent damage to my ankle, thus giving myself an excuse to never, ever exercise again.   Seriously, how did I ever get by without Megan?  Right now I love:  urlLink Megan  and  urlLink The Notorious C.H.O.   For your amusement: In November 2000, the Republic of Texas, a group that considers Texas a sovreign nation, proposed a solution that would have ended that whole recount/hanging chad election crisis.  "I personally would like Texas to join the South and the CSA (Confederate States of America, ahem) and install Gov. Bush as the second president of the Confederacy," wrote Daniel Miller, self-described "president of the Republic of Texas provisional government."  Why didn't anyone listen?  We could have gotten rid of Texas, Dubya, and the whole rest of the south, too!

      So, Megan and I are becoming even more similar than we were this September, when Mat pointed out that the reason I like Megan so much is that she's almost exactly like me.  Last night, Megan and I were watching TV, and she said, "Ooooh, look, they have a team of cartoon action heroes that are all fast food items.  Just like The Salty Witch, Tooth, and Culottes[1]...except none of those are fast food items."  After a few minutes of giggling, she said, "Can you put that in your blog?" at the exact same moment I was thinking, "That's so going in my blog!"  Then, Megan started having dreams about mashed potatoes, and I started having dreams about baked sweet potatoes.  Also, we've both had boys crack jokes to us, the punchline of which was "I'm going to rape you!"  Seriously, that happened, to both of us.  [Incidentaly, boys, that's never a good wooing technique.]  One thing we differ on is dating philosophy, which we spent the weekend debating.  I won't tell you who comes down on which side of the argument, but one of us thinks you should go out on dates even if they're with boys who you're not that excited about, just to keep your dating muscles from atrophying, while the other one thinks that dating for the sake of dating is stupid, and you should only bother to go out with the boys who twist your stomach into knots when they smile.  If only there were more of those boys, and they were easier to deal with.    [1]: The Salty Witch, Culottes, and the Tooth are the alter-egos of Megan, Ginny, and myself from a comic strip we drew during English class in 11th grade.  If you think we're delightfully odd girls now, you shoulda known us then.  I get the impression that college drags a lot of people towards normal, which makes me really, really curious about what some of my friends were like back in the day.  Right now I love: sweet potato fries from the Luna Grill.  Quote of the moment: "What? Ahhh. No. Why would you -- I mean, why would you even -- where, you, I, I, I, Anna? Are you totally uh, uh, uh, I don't even -- I don't -- I couldn't. No." -- Adam Brody

      Last night I dined with the Schneller brothers, their friend Nancy, and Ed.  They were kind of the human equivalent of Bad Boys 2 -- three hours of relentless entertainment that left me feeling a bit emotionally battered.  Ariel was intrigued to discover that we have blogs.  Yoni explained, "Yeah, but they're all about how they feel, and stuff."  Hmmm....what are these "feelings" of which you speak?  Tell me more!    The Schnellers rubbed Megan the wrong way at first, which Yoni tried to remedy by complimenting her hilights, which I think was fairly effective.  Ariel even waited until Megan left the room to tell his story about paying a friend to drink his own semen, which I thought was very gentlemanly.  Right now I love: the Charlie Brown Christmas CD.  Mmmmmmmmm, soothing.

      Has anyone else noticed that the Jeanie Teasdale columns in The Onion are turning into some damn good fiction?  It seems clear that the Sean charater represents The Onion's writers, which makes  urlLink this week's installment  a bittersweet and thought-provoking read.  Megan and I watched Mansfield Park this weekend, and once again we learned about how we want different things from boys.  She likes the charming cad, I like the serious and restrained character.  Fanny says something about her more dashing suitor that stuck in my head: "Like most charming people, he conceals an almost absolute dependence on the appreciation of others."  Tell it, sister.  It's not that I don't find my friends charming, because I do, it's that there's a particular brand of charm that makes me feel like someone's trying to sell me some snake oil.  Maybe it's just that extroverts seem weird and untrustworthy to me, unapolagetic hermit that I am.  Right now I'm excited about: The return of Berkely Breathed.

      I heard "That Summer Feeling" for the first time yesterday, and the result was a total nostalgia fit.  The nice kind of nostalgia, too, not the mopey, all-is-lost kind, because I'm pretty happy with my life right now.  This summer, though, was a doozy.  Lunching with consultants and almost-lawyers, Califoooooooooornia, having hours a day to watch MTV2, Beacon's Closet, picnics in Central Park, movies in Bryant Park, Lauren Day, driving around the beltway the wrong way TWICE, throwing up at the end-of-the-year party AGAIN, gospel music... that was all pretty great.  Unemployment is the best.  I miss you, NY, and you too, New Yorkers.  Fortunately....  I'm headed to NY for Thanksgiving.  I expect much fun to be had, and I look forward to seeing you all.

        The more I read about  urlLink Morris Dees , the more I'm convinced Lauren should marry him.  Check it: 1) He made a million dollars selling encyclopedias.  The man must be wicked charming. 2) He did for direct-mail fundraising what Dean's doing for internet fundraising, and he did it on behalf of McGovern and Carter.  3) He founded the Southern Poverty Law Center. 4) He's put groups like the White Patriot Party, Whiter Aryan Resistance and branches of the KKK out of business through lawsuits. 5) As part of a settlement, he forced a branch of the Klan to turn its headquarters over to the mother of a man it had lynched. 6) He's been threatened with death by multiple racist organizations, but instead of backing down... 7) He filed court orders to have the Klansmen evaluated for mental instability, which made the Klan so mad that Klan leader Louis Beam challenged Dees to a formal duel.   AND he did all of this after being brought up in a racist family.  His granddaddy was a Klansman.  He worked on the Wallace campaign as a kid.   How the hell do you wake up from that to become Morris Dees?  Lawyers are awesome, yo. (Yeah, that's a shout-out, my almost-a-lawyer friend.  I'm totally thinking about how awesome you are right now, my friend who is on their way to becoming a lawyer.  You're the best!)

      Julian, in  urlLink one of his recent blog posts , puts his finger on exactly why I've been having so much fun trading mix CDs and going to shows: "It's those rare occasions when you encounter something new that you all at once realize you should have liked [when you were 13] that you recapture that sense of becoming something—becoming the person you're going to be."   Researching hate groups has given me new faith in / fear of the power of ideas.  There's a book called  The Turner Diaries  which has been circulating among American white supremacists for years now.  It's a fictional story about a group called The Order that acts as the vanguard of a violent white supremacist revolution.  In the early 1980s, a man named Robert Matthews read the book and suggested to some friends that they form a group modeled on the one in the novel.  The Order robbed several banks and armored cars of over $4 million, killed one of their own members, and machine gunned Jewish radio host Alan Berg to death outside his home.    The book can take partial credit for many more than two murders, though.  Timothy McVeigh had a copy of it in his trunk when he was arrested.  I used to work for the ACLU and all, but if I could ban that book, I think I would.  On the other hand, it is a bit awe inspiring, what the printed word can get done.  Luther and Lincoln and Jefferson for the  Turner Diaries  isn't a bad trade.  It's just hard to swallow when you're reading about racist assholes all day.  Right now I love:  urlLink Songs of Love .  This is the song that changed my mildly-derisive-of-Ben-Folds tune.  You understand the suckiness of dating, Ben Folds, and you describe it with such charm and wit.  Come sit next to me.

      Megan and I saw Ben Lee & Phantom Planet at the Black Cat last night, and they were so good!  So good, in fact, that I feel compelled to stop referring to them as Claire Danes's boyfriend & those guys who sing the O.C. theme song.  Megan and I were cracking on Ben Lee like crazy during the hour long wait to get in, because  urlLink the boy is goofy lookin' .  It's somewhat ironic, then, that he won us over with a fantastic cover of the Christina Aguilera song "Beautiful."  After the show we went and talked to him.  Well, Megan talked to him (she wanted to know if he'd used a Beadazzler on his sweat shirt, or if it came with the sparkles) and I flitted around in the background like the easily starstruck doofus I am.  Phantom Planet was also excellent, although a number of things about their set made me feel old.  They were so loud I couldn't hear the words.  That bugs me.  Do you really need THREE electric guitars?  Plus, I was really concerned for the lead singer, who seemed to have chemically altered himself before the show.  He kept bumping into things and falling down, and then not being able to right himself for several minutes.  His bandmates looked a bit concerned, too.  I hope he doesn't permanently scar himself or anything, because  urlLink he's purty .  Anyway, I can die happy now, because I have heard "California" performed live.  That rocked.  Right now I love: Being asked "What's cooler than being cool?" by a goofy lookin' boy with an acoustic guitar.  Thank you, Ben Lee.

      I was attacked by a bird yesterday!  Megan and I were sitting and watching television when all of a sudden this bird FLEW DOWN OUR CHIMNEY.  It started squawking and flapping around the room, and so did Megan and I, because it's really scary when a bird suddenly invades your living space.  You feel violated.  Megan kept yelling "Get me a sheet!  Get me a sheet!" (no, I don't know what for), and I kept yelling "You like birds! You like birds!"  I think I thought Megan could, like, bond with the bird and calm it down.  Anyhoo, a few panicked minutes later, we got the bird outside, and after several thousand ohmigods, we went back to our usual Sunday routine.  But then the goddamn thing did it AGAIN.   It was even more panic-inducing the second time, because it suddenly seemed like the beginning of an endless stream of avian invaders.  Birds are SCARY.  They should NOT be in your house, any more than  urlLink asparagus  should be in your purse.  Anyway, our landlady's daughter's boyfriend came and put a piece of cardboard over our chimney and weighted it down with bricks, so I think we're OK for now.  Our landlady, who is Greek, says that in Greek folklore when a bird flies in your house it means someone's getting married.  What does it mean when a bird flies in your house twice, I wonder?  Right now I'm struck by the tragi-comedy of: The KKK's website, which gives you a frames/no frames option, because, as they put it, they "would like to keep our Websites friendly to all of our viewers out there!"  That's exactly what I've come to expect from the Klan -- friendly and prompt service for all my racist needs.  I wonder if they force Jewish visitors to their site to use frames, even when their browsers aren't frame-compliant.   Oh, The Klan.  Sigh.  Right now I love: The  urlLink Peppermint Mocha !  It's back!  It's delicious, minty crack.   No wonder Starbucks rules the world.

      I went salsa dancing last night, and it was soooooooooooo fun.  Lauren, we're totally going when you come to DC.  It was exactly like the  urlLink trailer for Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights , except the men I danced with where nowhere near as attractive as Diego Luna, and we never got to the part at the end of the movie where I stop sucking.  The club we went to was full of short, roundish Latino men who were excellent salsa dancers, and I got to dance with a lot of them.  Hee.  Before that we met up with Alex and Patrick and a friend of theirs who's applying to TFA.  Alex kept telling her friend, "Anna has a LOT to say about Teach for America.  A LOT."  I'm amused that people who didn't even know me while I was a teacher are recruiting me to talk their friends off the teaching ledge.  Seriously, people, it wasn't all bad.  It's also important to bear in mind that I loooooooooooooooooove to complain, so I took full advantage of the opportunity to bitch during my career of public service.  Megan says I need a warning label: "Objects derided may be more rewarding than they sound."  Right now I love: Mohitos.  They don't love me, though, at least not since I got up this morning.  Ooof.

      For those of you who where waiting on the edge of your seats, the answers to yesterday's trivia bonanza are:  1) George W. Bush during the 2000 election.  Heh.  [For the record, I would've disagreed with him at the time, and still do take issue with some of the ideas expressed in that statement.  Nevertheless, I say again, heh.]  2) Winston Churchill.  Well, not really, but it's commonly attributed to him, and he wishes he'd said it.  Right now I love: Chipotle burritos.  Yeah, Lauren, I know, all east coast Mexican food sucks it, but thankfully my taste buds don't know any better.  By the way, is there a food that they don't do as well on the west coast?  Chowdah?  Cheese steaks?  Blech.

      Last night I led another TFA learning team meeting.  I feel like such a poser, giving people who are actually in the classroom suggestions about how to teach better.   If TFA wants to pay me $1000 to do it, though, who am I to complain?  It also helps me fight my perverse, masochistic desire to go back to the classroom.  One of the social studies teachers I work with is also a music teacher, and he gave me some guitar pointers.  He was very TFA about it, all methodical and explicit.  It was great, because his focus was on helping me learn how to play the guitar, whereas Curt (my guitar teacher) focuses on radically changing my personality.  For him the guitar is just a means to that end.  OK, kids, time for a game of "Guess who said that!"  1) "Maybe I'm missing something here. I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation-building corps from America? Absolutely not. It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the exit strategy obvious. I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be. I think the United States must be humble . in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course."  2) "Don't talk to me about naval tradition. It's nothing but rum, sodomy and the lash."  Anyone? (Googling is cheating.)  Right now I love: " urlLink Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie " by Bob Dylan.  Thanks, John.  Right now I'm amused by: The fact that the Blogger spellchecker doesn't recognize the verb "googling" despite the fact that Blogger is owned by Google.  Get on that, Jason.

      I went out with people from work yesterday, and it was fun.  Matt suggested that we share a cigarette, so I went and bummed us one, and, like, eight people came up to me and said, "Oh, come on, you don't smoke!"  I wonder if it's the dimples and curls, or possibly the fact that I nearly burned my cornea off while trying to get the damn thing lit.  Also, is there anything more fun than getting shit-faced and listening to uplifting music on the Metro on the way home?  Life suddenly makes sense, in this broad, cosmic way.  It's awesome.  Megan and I were e-mailing about our love of Ephram Brown (which is, incidentally, totally and completely in conformity with all of the  important  social norms, thank you very much, Dolan) and she penned this lil' ditty, to be sung to the tune of "Nasty Boys," by Janet Jackson.  high school, high school boys don't ever change oh you high school boys no my first name ain't baby! It's Megan, and it's Bradley if you're 16.  Yeah! Preach it, sister!  Right now I love: Looking at the genres that the music I like is assigned to.  A lot of it, disturbingly, is "Adult Alternative."  I'm so old.  But sometimes genre names are hilarious.  I enjoy something called "cuddlecore," I'm proud to report.

      So I was looking at my webstats yesterday, and, like 60% of the hits on my blog are me.  A couple of people have asked me why I started blogging, and I've got a lot of answers (it's the inevitable result of my nerdishness, I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk now, I have a lot of friends who live far away) but really, the number one reason is that I really love reading it.  Is it wrong that I find my own blog so entertaining?  I think it's partly because I have such a terrible memory.  Ok, it's also partly because I'm totally self-absorbed.  But in a charming way!  Right?  Guys? (Also, in case my stalkers are worried, I was mostly unable to tell who else is reading my blog, because so many of ya'll go to the same schools and use the same ISPs.  So stalk away!)  Right now I love: Ephram Brown.  OK, so, Everwood is a terrible show, true.   But seriously, that kid is hot.  Check out Sunday's rebroadcast if you don't believe me.  Megan's got my back on this one.  Right now I'm disgusted with myself because: I want to see  urlLink In the Cut .  It looks awful, I know, but the  urlLink NY Times makes the Mark Ruffalo parts sound so appealing!

      So, I wrote my song, and played it for Curt.  I don't even like karaoke, and I wrote a song.  Hee.  I can't stop telling people, I'm so amused, and proud.  It's like that scene in Rushmore where Max goes to dinner with Blume, Ms. Cross, and her boyfriend, and keeps interrupting the boyfriend to say, "I wrote a hit play and directed it!"  I wrote a song, and sang it!  Curt applauded, and then pointed out that it's me "singing" a poem I wrote.  My song consists of three notes.  So my homework for next week is to come up with some kind of melody for my song.  As I was leaving, I mentioned that it's my firm intention never to play this song for anyone I know, ever, and I got a long lecture from Curt about this.  Why do people always gotta say no, Curt wants to know?  When people ask you to play at a party, just say sure, and play a song about how delicious the brownies look, and then they'll give you the whole plate.  Whenever I've decided that Curt is batty, and I'm not coming back, he says something like that and convinces me that he's got my number.  I like that he's determined to make me less negative, even though I'm not sure I wanna be, and I admire that he's using the promise of brownies as leverage.  Right now I love: Jogging to  urlLink "There's Always Someone Cooler Than You"  and speeding up to a sprint when it gets to the "Nerds go wild!" part.

      My office is renting out a new space because we're expanding so fast we can't all fit in our current building.   They expected everyone who has to move to be really mad, so they're throwing all these perks at us.  It's apparently a beautiful space, all edgy and dot-commed out.  There's a gym in the building, and a TV in the break room.  The cubes are bigger, and they're next to the windows -- the executive offices are in the interior.  Hooray for egalitarian office design, I say!  Anyway, I'm moving, along with all the people on my team, and I'm psyched.  The people on my team are the people I like best, and I expect we're going to become really tight as a result of being isolated from the main office.  Plus, this means I'm less likely to be taken off interesting knowledge management projects and tasked to boring force deployment stuff, because all that will be in a different building.  Plus, they're giving us all new notebook computers to keep us happy.  Hee!  (Those of you who don't know what force deployment is, lend me your ears.  Apparently, the military has no idea where all its stuff is.  The commander of a division of subs knows where his subs are, but the secretary of the Navy doesn't have any centralized database of where all the subs are.  The same goes for troops, and god knows what else.  A lot of what we do here at DFI is tracking down that information, compiling it into one database, and writing software that helps the military to use it.  We euphemisticaly refer to that as "force deployment research."  Isn't that reassuring, folks?  Y'know all those tanks and planes that Dubya is spending your tax dollars on?  He DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.)  Right now I love: Moving!  Also, "Clark Gable" by The Postal Service.  "I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London Underground, when it struck me that I've been waiting since birth to find a love that would look and sound like a movie."  Me too, Ben Gibbard.

      I went to the Badly Drawn Boy concert at the 9:30 club on Friday.  It was one of the best shows I've ever seen, not least because he opened with a performance of that Jackson Five song, "I Want You Back."  I've never really been that into seeing music performed live, but for some reason things just clicked at this show, and it killed me, softly.  Megan, Ed, and Jen all decided to leave early, because he didn't start playing until 11:30, and did a really long set.  I was glad I stayed, but it meant I had to take the Metro home by myself at 2 in the morning.   That is way too late for me, because I am very old, so I spent the rest of the weekend recuperating, and did nothing.  Hooray!  Jen told me about a friend of hers who started a mix tape club at Brandeis, so I'm going to try starting one here.  I've already gotten one response to my  urlLink craig's list posting .  I'm very excited to see how it goes.  Right now I love: "I Don't Love Anyone" - Belle & Sebastian, and "Charm Attack" - Leona Naess.

      A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with Ed about music.  The question I posed to him was, why is it so hard to defend my musical preferences, even though I'll get up in anyone's grill about how  urlLink Joe Versus the Volcano  is a classic of modern cinema? (It  urlLink really is great , for the record.)  Before we move on, I want to launch a pre-emptive shut-the-hell-up strike against anyone who thinks the answer is that my musical tastes are indefensible.  They include things that "suck," granted, but anyone who's honest with themselves likes one or two of Journey's greatest hits, or something equally "awful."   My old theory was that scars from the middle school rap vs. grunge throwdown discouraged me from declaring my musical allegiances.  My new theory is that it's just hard to defend your musical preferences, because it's hard to articulate what's great (or sucky) about music.  I've noticed that a lot of people blanche when you ask them what music they like.  I think the fear that you'll get sneered at when you say you like pedestrian pop like U2 is actually pretty widespread.    Anyway, lately I've been on a fantastic voyage of musical discovery.  I want to know enough about music to be able to defend  Justin Timberlake  as vigorously as I do Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.  The musical curriculum I've designed for myself consists of guitar lessons, a  urlLink Rhapsody  subscription, and mix tapes.  I never really did the mix tape exchange thing in 7th grade, but I'm suddenly very into it.  Every CD I've gotten someone to make for me so far has been great.  So if you're reading this blog, and you haven't made me a CD of your favorite songs yet, please do.  You don't even have to send me the CD -- just make a list of what songs you would put on it,  urlLink send it to me , and I'll track 'em down.  I'll send you a list of Anna classics, we'll bond, it'll be great.     Right now I love:  urlLink http://www.nationmaster.com .  It's the policy nerd version of all those VH1 list shows.

      A personal ad from a White Aryan Resistance internet bulletin board:  "Greetings, White Nationalist women....  My hobbies are flags, music, and sports.  I am looking for a down-to-earth lady who is not afraid to be a White Nationalist.  She should also be friendly, considerate, quiet and gentle.  One who is willing to work with her mate in other word [sic], she should be a loyal, steadfast real sweetheart.  Her weight must be in proportion to her height.  She can work but she willing [sic] to stay home 50 percent of the time.  Any job is fine, especially a flight attendant.  I consider them to be excellently trained to be good wives and mothers....As to her religion?  Catholic, Protestant, Identity, Klan, Mormon, Nazi, Odinist is OK to me."  I once read that flight attendants were ranked the second sexiest profession (after teachers, which is why I remember this fact).  Do you think it's because they're so excellently trained to be good wives and mothers?  I mean, he has a point about that, if you think willingness to bring you drinks and peanuts is what makes a good wife.   urlLink Slate's summary  of Pattie Davis's attack on the Reagan miniseries: "Davis also argued that her father [Ronald Reagan] must have had a compassionate view towards AIDS victims because once, after she commented that Rock Hudson looked 'weird' kissing Doris Day in a movie, her father said that Hudson 'didn't really have a lot of experience kissing women' and would rather 'be kissing a man.'"  That  IS  so compassionate.  I'm glad we cleared that up.

      I never realized how weak your ring finger is.  It's surprisingly difficult to move it without moving your pinky or index finger.  Curt (my guitar teacher) says that's why people put their wedding rings on that finger -- it's the only codependent finger.  Oh, Curt.   P Diddy went to my school!  Stitt, the middle school I used to teach at, is one of the schools that will be benefitting from the proceeds of  urlLink Puffy's charity run . He came by to visit and everything, MTV camera crews in tow.  My friend Maddie and her class are going to be in the MTV special about Diddy's magnanimity.  I bet the kids were a lot more excited than they were when Henry Kissinger came last year.  Megan and I have been talking a lot about our respective approaches to guys.  She's trying to talk me out of my aversion to having the moves put on me.  I can't help it -- every time it seems like a guy is bustin' out a well-honed line, I'm filled with disdain and a desire to prove to him that I am unlike other girls by demonstrating that lines don't work on me.   Last night, I discovered Megan's parallel pet peeve.  I was talking to Greta, and she was telling me about the compliments her lesbian friends have used to try and hit on her.  I was oohing and aahing, because some of them were pretty sweet, but Megan, overhearing this, started diatribing about how easily taken in girls are by compliments.  When a guy compliments her, she takes it as a sign that he's a clever and dangerous adversary, and immediately hoists her emotional drawbridge.  Whereas when someone compliments me, I'm all, "That's SO true!  You must be very observant.  Come over here and sit next to me."  Anyway, I think Megan and I just have slightly different versions of the same hangup.  I can't decide if this is (more) evidence that the two of us are smarter than the average she-bear or (further) proof that we're too suspicious of people.  Probably both.  Strange and complex women, Megan and I are.  Right now I'm tickled by: The new  urlLink Gilmore Girls recaplet , in which Pamie laments, "Dammit. I wanted some Rodin in the hizzy."  Sounds like something  urlLink Steve  would say.  Right now I love: The  urlLink Stars Hollow Town Troubadour .  Thanks, Jamie.

      A number of nice things happened last night.  I had dinner with a friend from work and his significant other, and they mistook me for a) an extrovert, and b) someone who belongs in San Francisco.  This is the second time since I started work that someone has reacted with surprise when I described myself as a misanthrope.  Hooray for the successful masking of my true self!  Also, I look like I'd fit in San Francisco!  It's the second-hand jewelry, I bet.  Thank you Jen, and thank you Beacon's Closet.  The other nice thing that happened last night was that I talked to Mat, and it went well, I thought.   Enlightening, bittersweet, cathartic.  Nice coda, that.  Those Cusicks are quality folk.  The guitar lesson itself was entertaining enough, though.  Curt insisted that I make up a song about my Halloween, which I performed as a spoken-word piece while accompanying myself on the guitar.  He kept interrupting me to tell me it wasn't interesting enough, and inserted his own verse about a porpoise interrupting me and my friends' dancing at Chief Ike's and getting everyone wet and ruining the vibe.  He also added a chorus that went "Halloween -- masks, and candy, and fun?  Whatever."  He said it matched my cynical tone, and would help the listener to realize that I'm not just bitter, I'm deep.  My assignment for next week is to make up a song, which I have to SING, not just speak.  As some of you may remember, I don't sing, as a rule.  Curt, however, who seems to see himself as my personal therapist/life coach/troubadour, does not accept excuses.  Exit Anna the Square, stage left.  Enter, Anna the sensitive singer-songwriter, stage right.  Heh.   And, Eep!  Right now I love: "Nothin' Else" by Justin Timberlake, because it includes the line "You're out of this world, except you're not green."   I'd never thought about it before, but it would be kind of a dealbreaker, greenness.  Ah, Justin, always with the insight.

      I almost passed out at the dentist today.   As the dentist took my pulse and ratcheted my chair back until I was about 45 degrees below horizontal, I asked him if it was the novocaine shot.  No, apparently it was anxiety from hearing more about how I have the teeth of a genetic freak.  Teeth like mine just don't happen since fluoridated water, apparently.  If I'd have known that fluoridation wasn't going to work on me, I would have objected more vocally to that dastardly communist plot to sap my precious bodily fluids.  It was nice that the dentist noticed my tenuous grasp on consciousness, though.  Normally they just keep drilling through my mini-anxiety attacks.  At least I don't have to go back for almost two whole weeks.  Wheeeeeeee!  I had lunch with Jess Wendover today.  She is fantastic.  We talked about San Francisco, and boys, and jobs that are good for the world.  She's enjoying all three, I'm happy to report.  For all my friends who enjoy a good laugh at the expense of Christian fundamentalists, or who hate George W.,  (in other words, all of my friends): Check out  urlLink Joan Didion's article on the Left Behind books and Dubya's fundamentalist outlook .  The Left Behind books, which have sold more than 55 million copies all told, are a Christian adventure/fantasy series about the period between the Rapture and the second coming of Christ.  One of the signs of the apocalypse in these books is "a Jewish Nationalist conference in Manhattan that has something to do with a new world order government."  It's good to know that a large portion of the American public is still buying into the whole Protocols of the Elders of Zion myth.  It's even better to know that the people selling that myth are the president's homies.  Ahora me gusta: "Me Gustas Tu," por Manu Chao.  Gracias, Ed.

      The best thing that happened to me on Halloween was that I saw a guy in an alarmingly good Mike Meyers costume (y'know, the guy from Halloween the movie).  He looked exactly like him, I guess because the character wears a mask in the movie, so it's not a hard look to capture.  We both got off the subway (Metro!  I mean Metro!) at the same time, and he stepped out of my way very politely to let me go first, and gave me the ladies-first nod.  That made me smile, encountering such a polite serial murderer.  I finally got to that crepe restaurant in Adams Morgan that I've been hearing about since I moved to DC.  It was good, although it was no  urlLink Ti Couz .  (Megan doesn't understand my determination to live in San Francisco at some point, but I think she would if she'd ever eaten there.)  Megan and Nick Boyle and I played girl-hot or boy-hot, a game inspired by a conversation I had with Maggie and Scott.  They like to check girls out together and discuss which ones are hot, and they've discovered that they have completely different criteria for hotness.  Maggie will say a girl's hot because she's thin, and well dressed, and her hair looks great, and she has a pretty face.  Scott, on the other hand, is looking for brick houses, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.  Nick and Megan and I discussed this at length, using celebreties as examples.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Sarah Jessica Parker are girl-hot, we decided.  Guy-hot celebreties are the type that sensitive men will insist that they don't find attractive, like Pamela Anderson.  We spent about an hour looking for good examples of girl-hot and guy-hot passing by the window, but found neither.  Right now I'm tickled by: Jason's Halloween Buffy shout-out on the  urlLink blogger.com  home page.  Right now I love: Smart Start with Vanilla Silk.  Damn you, soy milk, with your seductively delicious vanilla flavoring!  I resisted you for so long!

      This was a good year.  I know it must have been, because I feel the desire to listen to Radiohead so much less often now than I did in January.  Less teaching probably helps, as does living with Megan.  Don't leave me, Megs!  Thinking about the year, macro-style, I noticed something.  My friendships with the women have been incredibly rewarding.  I met some fantastic girls (Grets, Jen), and got a lot closer to some of my best friends (Lauren, Megan).  It occurred to me a while ago that I didn't have any female role models.  All the famous people I look up to (Abraham Lincoln, Jon Stewart) are men.  I stopped worrying, though, when I realized that there are a lot of women I really admire, they're just not famous.  The girls I know are pretty fuckin' great, and it became even more clear to me this year.  Things didn't work out so well with my guy friends, though.  I'm currently on the outs (to varying degrees) with several of the best people I've ever met, and all of them happen to be men.  Oops.  I fucked up, in various ways.  I miss you, in various ways.

      So, I'm back from Miami.  The best things about my trip were, in order of fun level:  1) My sister got bit by a parrot. 2) I got to spend time with my family. 3) I got some GREAT presents.  I heart my i-Pod.  I spit upon you, Nomad Zen!  Maggie even bought me a brightly colored hat and gloves from The Gap.   Aaah, the acquisition of luxury goods.  It pleases me so. 4) I saw Bad Santa, which was excellent. 5) My sister almost got bit by a cockatoo. 6) I discovered that my mom is something of a Jai Alai shark. 7) I came home to find my two fantastic roommates and more excellent presents waiting for me.  Also, in case you were wondering, you CAN get on an airplane without a photo ID.  Even when the Terrorometer is at Orange.  At least, you can if you look like me.

      I know you're all freaking out because the terrorism alert has been raised to orange, but don't you worry your pretty little heads.  The Washington establishment and I have it all under control.  I'm going to Google terrorists with extra diligence until I leave for Miami on Tuesday, just to make sure that America stays safe.  Don't even think about starting a blog, Osama.  Google and I are on your tail.  Why am I the only person who can accept the fact that the Lord of the Rings movies suck?  Because they really, REALLY do.  HARD.  What the hell is up with all this Best Film of the Year lunacy? I haven't seen a movie that relied on the exposition fairy that heavily since "Fuschia Evil."  (A Ginny Too / Anna Utgoff / Maggie Utgoff production which none of you will ever see, ever.  Even though it's way better than "Return of the King.") Also, in a movie where all the heroes are ultra-white, is it really necessary to make the villanous sub-human hordes look so distinctly African/Middle Eastern?  Did they really need to be wearing those Moorish turbans?   urlLink   I got in a big fight with Megan about this, in which I mocked precious memories from her childhood, and she accused me of hating on things everyone likes just to be contrary (e.g. Seinfeld), but we've since made up over a HUGE plate of Christmas Chip Cookies (green chocolate chip cookies with red & green M&Ms).  I made 8 dozen.  I don't know why, but I had this memory of one batch not being enough.  Anyhoo, if anyone in the Washington metropolitan area wants some cookies, come on by.  I may be forced to take some to my guitar lesson on Tuesday, just so they don't go to waste.  Right now I miss: school vacations, which put real-person vacations from work TO SHAME.  Right now I love: being done with my Christmas shopping.  Right now I'm depressed by:  urlLink The article the Post did recently on conspicuos consumption , which observed that "Consumerism was the triumphant winner of the ideological wars of the 20th century, beating out both religion and politics as the path millions of Americans follow to find purpose, meaning, order and transcendent exaltation in their lives....  But that doesn't mean shopping makes us happy. Robert Lane, author of The Loss of Happiness in Market Democracies, is pretty certain that it doesn't. Plot a chart with two lines, he says, one representing the U.S. GDP per capita from 1940 to 1990 and the other indicating the percentage of people who described themselves to pollsters as 'very happy.' The lines run in opposite directions." Sigh.

      So, I think I might know what I want to do with my life.  I think I want to study whether or not there are ways of designing curricula/schools that increase the likelihood that students, particularly minority students, will vote.  After a bit o' graduate education, I'd either become a policy wonk or try to open a charter school.  I think this plan is a good combination of my various interests (education, policy, politics), skills (research, crazy idea generation) and values (equality, democracy, knowledge).  I also really think it could work, and that you could educate voters, if you had four years of high school and some amazing teachers to work with.  I'm somewhat...whimsical, so we'll see how long I stick to this plan, but it feels sort of perfect right now.  They have an interdisciplinary graduate program at Stanford that sounds ideal.  So now all I have to do is get into Stanford.  Heh.  Right now I love: Diet Dr. Pepper.  It does taste more like regular Dr. Pepper!

      I should probably stop posting about my snack foods of choice, but I can't resist sharing the message on the back of the bag of sunflower seeds I purchased today.  "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE A SEEDER!  Seeders are unique.  They're cool, confident, independent, active, and hard working.  They know that eating DAVID brand Sunflower Seeds makes whatever they do more enjoyable.  Things are better with DAVID because they're a snack and an activity.  Experience SNACKTIVITY (TM)."  First off, those are some pretty bold claims about people who eat sunflower seeds.  However, as I am the only person I know who eats sunflower seeds, and I am indeed cool, confident, independent, active, and hard working, I see no reason to challenge DAVID's assertions.  Second, things really ARE better when they're a snack and an activity.  Hence my aforeblogged love of bubble gum.  I think maximizing SNACKTIVITY (TM) might be my new goal in life.  If you have any other SNACKTIVITY (TM) foods to suggest, please, share the love.  Right now I love: SNACKTIVITY (TM), and  urlLink episodes of the O.C. that reference  When Harry Met Sally  .

      I've become addicted to sugar free Wild Strawberry Bubble Yum.  So good!  I've been kickin' it  urlLink Violet Beauregard -style around the office for the last few days.  I'm guessing the bubble blowing doesn't exactly contribute to my reputation as a competent professional, but fuck it! I like bubble gum!  Also, how did it take me so long to discover smoked almonds?  They taste just like bacon!  And if you spill them all over yourself and your computer, they make you and your cubicle SMELL just like bacon!  For several days!  Quote of the moment: "Anybody who can suck that bad and still make straight girls see Jesus is doing something right. Very, very right." --  urlLink Slate on Justin Timberlake   To Dolan: You don't have comments on your blog, so I'm going to say this here.  I don't think that either humility or confidence are the "correct" way to approach people.  They're just different styles.  I think I'm pretty deferential myself, but I like having friends who are more outgoing and assertive than I am.  Whoever told you that you ought to be more humble was silly, and also not very humble, otherwise he wouldn't be telling people he just met that they have the "wrong" personality.

      D'ya think the army meant to reference a Patrick Swayze movie when it named the hunt for Saddam Hussein "Operation  urlLink Red Dawn "?  Now we can add getting Bush re-elected to the list of Saddam's crimes against humanity.  Jerk.  The office Christmas party was fun, as promised.  My stomach was so full of chocolate fondue that I never really got that drunk, which was probably good, since my dad was there.  (Speaking of my dad, when I had lunch with him a week ago, he told me they were going to catch Saddam.  He didn't make any chronological predictions, but he was really confident, and at the time I couldn't understand why.  He also told me we were going to war against Iraq on September 12, 2001.  My dad, defense forecaster extraordinaire!  He's going to make a killing on the terrorism futures market.)

Surely, "Voyage of the Mimi" deserves to replace either "Bounce" or "Reindeer Games" in the ill-conceived  urlLink Ben Affleck DVD Collection  that Megan discovered on Amazon.

I was so craving the opportunity to cram my tongue down your Republican throat.  And you're totally right, my criticism of Bush's economic policies is mindlessly parroted from the liberal media.

      Tonight is the office Christmas party, which is apparently NUTTY at DFI.  They spend $25,000 on food and booze!  500 people come!  Everyone gets ripped, even the seniors!  I fully expect to kick it Bridget Jones-style, possibly including a drunken performance of I Will Survive.  I've become obsessed with drinking water at work.  It's a good outlet for my oral fixation, and it gives me an excuse to get up and go to the bathroom at least once an hour.  Plus, I feel so healthy.  Why haven't people been pointing me out to their friends on the street?  "Oooh!  Look at that girl!  She looks so hydrated!"  Megan found another entry on the short, short list of reasons why DC is better than NY.  "[Trista & Ryan's wedding] was the No. 1 ranked program in every single Top 10 market. That is, except in Washington, D.C. Although the majority of people in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, even San Francisco were watching America's Favorite Made-for-TV Couple, in our city, poor Trista and Ryan got creamed by a 'Law & Order' rerun. You also snubbed the crazy-in-love couple for WTTG's 10 p.m. news although Tracey Neale isn't even there, and after that you turned your back on Trista for a rerun of 'The Simpsons.'"  Unfortunately, Megan, Leota and I were among the few Washingtonians who did watch The Wedding of The Decade.  I guess we belong in NY or San Francisco!

      Apparently I've been denied my interim security clearance.  I won't hear why until they respond to my written request for an explanation, but I'm pretty sure I got negged because I admitted to having seen a psychiatrist.  Once.  For depression I was struggling with during my first year as a teacher.  I explained all of this on the form, and I'm sure the doctor would have confirmed it if they called her, but apparently, once you're in therapy, you're automatically a wacko in the eyes of the feds.  It's great how the federal government discriminates against people who seek professional help for their emotional problems.  Jerks.  In other government suckage-related news,  urlLink according to Salon , the average 25-year-old is going to pay $322,000 more in payroll taxes for social security and medicare than she will ever get back in benefits.

      The Onion is stealing from my life again!  I forgive them, though, because " urlLink Substitute Teacher Totally Freaks " is hilarious.  Unfortunately, my students never reacted like this when I flipped out: "None of us had any idea that Mrs. Krafft was capable of such brute rage," [a student] said. "We thought she was a pushover, and that we could get away with hassling her. And we did, for weeks. But we have now reaped the bitter harvest that underestimating Mrs. Krafft sowed."  When teachers flip out, students seem to think of it as more of a personal triumph than a bitter harvest.  I haaaaaaaaaaaaate it when men on the street suggest/ask/demand that I smile.  It's simultaneously a critique of my attitude towards life (smile more!) and a claim that I'm obligated to decorate my face with a grin for the enjoyment of men on the street (smile pretty for me!).  Jerks.  It happens a lot, and it's not charming.  Today, though, I was walking down the street and a man walking towards me looked right at me and smiled.  Not a leer, or a smirk, but a real smile.  He kept smiling for 30 seconds or so until I smiled back, and then his smile got bigger and he let out a satisfied, quiet little "Yeahhhhhh!!!!"  That's the way to get a girl to smile.  Appreciative, not demanding.  Tit for tat.  Well done, stranger.  Right now I love: Videos that feature Mos Def.  Seriously, though, Alicia, SHUT UP.  Right now I'm putty in the hands of: The Gap, again!  I cannot resist  urlLink the combination of Scarlett Johansson, Zooey Deschanel, and The Shins .

      Once again, I'm completely shocked by an obvious truth about the real world.  People actually get sexually harassed!  Like, a lot!  Girls (not a girl, either, but girlS) I know!  A lot of men who are in power seem to have no idea of how seriously creepy it is when someone who has control over your job wants to have sex with you.  Your boss flirting with you is not cool, ever.  Always a big deal.  The really awful part is how hard it is to do anything about it.  When my ex-roommate complained about having her ass slapped by her boss, everyone at work told her she was silly for making a big fuss about it, and pressured her to drop it.  My other friend who is having this problem hasn't said anything at all, because taking her employer on could wreck her career and lose her a lot of friends.    On that note, why do men keep treating my female friends so badly?  They are uniformly fantastic, and completely undeserving of this.  I don't think men in general suck or anything, but jeezus, my friends and loved ones have run into a LOT of awful ones in the recent past.  It makes me violently angry, and I'm not usually an angry person.  I've suddenly got an Enemies List.  You know who you are, and I would advise you to steer clear of me.   Sorry about the angry/mopey postings of the past two days.  Tomorrow, though, Megan, Leota and I rock Christmas!  With photos!  Right now I love: My new sexy pilgrim shoes.

I usually drag Megan to things like that, because she's my significant other in pretty much every way except for one, but she was busy studying for the LSATs.

      So, I was Lexis-Nexising myself this afternoon (shut up), and I discovered this article from the June 12, 1997 edition of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram (Texas).  "Virginia high school students Ginny Too and Anna Utgoff have an entire home page dedicated to [Jelly Bellies].  Photos show the two reveling with their favorite flavors and displaying Jelly Belly boxes.  'Here are Ginny and Anna frolicking in their Jelly Belly paraphernalia,' a caption says.  'Ginny is wearing a genuine Jelly Belly hat that Liz gave to her.  Liz tells us that everyone must wear these hats when visiting the Jelly Belly factory. '  Liz is their friend.  Apparently, they have several.  Then there's the Jelly Belly magic trick involving soda pop.  No, I am not making this up."  Now that's just unnecessary sass. "Apparently" we have several friends??!???  And why would the author be making it up?  Why WOULDN'T you design a web page that demonstrated how to make a lava lamp out of Jelly Bellies and Sprite?

      Thanksgiving was fun.  Lauren almost got in a fight with another volunteer at the homeless shelter, Greta spat apple cider on things and worried that our food was going to be eaten by wild dogs, and I learned that sautee does not mean "poke" or "look at."  I did some other fun things, too, like Yoga, eating, dancing, more eating, and getting punched in the face at a bar. (Really!  Accidentaly, but it really happened!  My lip split and everything!)

      I hung out with fellow dinos Amy Phillips, Sybil Dunlop & Steve Maloney on Wednesday night.  It was lovely.  Whenever I go back to Princeton, I feel all guilty because I failed so colossally to network there, what with being off campus every weekend for debate, plus my busy schedule of looking down my nose at 95% of the rest of campus.  I'm realizing, though, that APDA is a rockin' social network.   Years after graduating, I'm still making new debate friends, and reconnecting with old ones.  If you're looking for smart, snarky people, ex-debaters are a damn good bet.  The only drawback is that when you introduce your debate friends to your other friends, and you have to explain how you know them, it forces you kind of violently out of the nerd closet.  Speaking of debate, let's step into the wayback machine and talk political philosophy.  I've been reading about kerazy militias and wondering, do they kind of have a point?  If people like the Montana Freemen want to retreat onto a ranch and stop being part of the United States, why can't they?  I mean, obviously it's just not practical.  (If we let you secede, Johnny, we'd have to let Suzy secede, too, and pretty soon the whole class would be violently revolting against government authority!)  I find that unsatisfying, though.  There must be some good philsophizin' about why people don't have the right to politely decline to participate in the social contract.  Anyone?  Right now I'm enjoying: a vaguely woozy feeling that's part of the tail-end of my illness.  Trippy.

The other night I dreamed that I drank a Barq's Root Beer (mmmm), and I actually woke up and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth.  Last night, though, was actually pretty intriguing.  I was wrestling a toothless alligator for, like, an hour, and then Thandie Newton and Carter from E.R. showed up, and I realized I was in their beach house.  It was really embarrassing, because I was all dirty, and in their house without permission, and I hadn't even been able to kill this alligator with no teeth.

I Googled him to find his filmography, and I think he may be the most hilarious terrorist I've read about yet.  Here are the highlights:    Rooster: Spurs of Death! :Stoke and his son Wyatt take their prize roosters to a cock fight, only to find deceit and cheating by a competitor has forced them to lose their winnings. On the way, Wyatt learns about love from a runaway hooker (Kristine DeBell) and that maybe the 'cocker' trade is not right for him.  (That's porn, right?  Also, what does the title mean?  Roosters spur people to die?  Roosters use those funny spur-looking things on their heads to kill people?)   You're Jinxed, Friend... You've Met Sacramento : Shake hands with Jack "Sacramento" Thompson, one of the   orneriest hombres   that ever rode the prairies. When a corrupt town boss kidnaps his kids, Sacramento sets out to free them and show the crook just how jinxed he is. (Emphasis mine.  I'm going to start referring to my friends from Sacramento as ornery hombres.  Try saying it out loud!  It's like a tongue twister!)   Bad Jim :The first movie ever about Billy the Kid's horse. When an innocent man buys it, he begins a spree of robbing and killing. Now, this is a horse of a different color! (That's tremendous.  I can't even snark this one.)  Ty also markets a line of "mystik" skin care products on his  urlLink website .  Last, but not least, he was born Orson Whipple Hungerford Jr.  No, really.  I can't believe I got paid to read about this guy.  I heart my job.  Right now I'm lovin': The Candy Butchers - Painkillers

      So, out of the blue, one of my two best friends from elementary school, Heather McDonald, e-mailed me.  I haven't talked to her since we ended up at different high schools, but she apparently happened across my blog.  She says I write exactly like I spoke in 7th grade, which sounds insulting, now that I'm repeating it, but was actually kind of cool to hear.  We met at Politics and Prose for coffee and to hear Ron Suskind speak.  (He's hilarious and charming and smart, by the way.)  It was great.  She's a total hipster now (Shins tickets, thick-rimmed specs, all black outfit, bleached hair), but she also still sounds like her 7th grade self to my ears.  Yesterday I was whining about how disconnected I feel from some people.  Well, Heather reminded me of how sometimes it works the other way around, and you meet someone whose brain seems to work the same way as yours does.  Yay!  Right now I'm pleased that: Music from Damien Rice's album was used in wistful end-of-episode montages in  Alias  AND  The O.C.  this week.  He's Lindsay's tiny Irish boyfriend! He _totally_ rocked us at the 9:30 club this December.

      I went over to Julian's last night and MST3Ked The State of The Union with Gibs, Ed, Julian, and some other folks.  Man, we're hilarious.  The American people know how to spend their money better than the government?  Yeah, I guess that's true.  We wouldn't send $87 billion in cash to a P.O. box in Baghdad.  (TM Gibs)  We will bring the terrorists to justice?  If by "justice," you mean "Cuba," then sure.  Cleverest thing I read this week: David Foster Wallace names a local bar in  Infinte Jest  "The Unexamined Life."  Bwa ha ha! (**)  Stupidest thing I read this week: They want to change the term "suicide bombers" to "homicide bombers"?  Zuh?  The utter uselessness of the term "homicide bomber" didn't occur to the people who came up with it?  How is that possible?  Sometimes people fail to Get It on such a fundamental level that it seems like they must have been raised on a different planet.  It's just mindboggling, the number of people who like  The Nanny , or think "sarcastic" is an insult, or think it's offensive to say "handicapped" instead of "disabled."   I'm not trying to say anything about the merit or intelligence of such people(*).   They're just so different that I despair of ever understanding them.   (*) Clearly, I am certain that such people are much stupider than I am.   I'm just too sneaky, not to mention aware of (although not convinced of) my own fallibility and subjectivity, to actually SAY that.  Mwa ha ha! (**)  (**) Isn't it funny that one letter can turn a joyous belly laugh into a Dr.-Claw-stroking-his-cat cackle?  Also, what was that cat's name?  You know, the dramatic foil for Inspector Gadget's dog?  I can't find it anywhere.

       I spent the evening trying to figure out how to make a chocolate souffle.  The results were just...well...terrible.  When I took it out of the oven it collapsed faster than Donna Martin on prom night. (Ba-dum-BUM!)  The top was burned, and the inside was literally pulsating.  It tasted kind of like microwaved marshmallow Peeps gone terribly, terribly wrong.  This is what you get when you summarize Julia Child's recipe on the back of a Borders napkin so you don't actually have to buy the book.  I expect I'm going to spend the next few months making dozens of only marginally less terrible practice souffles.  I will not be bested by a pastry, damnit!  I mentioned a few posts back that I was disspointed that the only commentator I know of who's rating the candidates by dreaminess is my friend Ginny.  I stand corrected.  While watching George Snuffalufagus's talk show this morning (I'd already gone through all my TiVoed MTV Video Wakeups), I saw the chairman of the RNC describe Edwards as a "handsome devil" when asked to list the candidate's greatest strength.  I hope the Edwards camp uses that in their campaign ads.

      I went to Silver Spring and made Lindsay watch  urlLink All The Real Girls , which is, I think, the realest movie I've ever seen.  I really like watching it with people I know, because they are inevitably hooked.  There's this moment in the movie where the two main characters are talking on the phone, and suddenly you know everything's going to change, even though they don't know it yet.  It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and everyone I've seen the movie with has had the same horrified reaction.  It's great.

       urlLink   The nice thing about going to a ball where everyone else is 50+ is that you get to hear a lot about how pretty you are.  I actually got asked if I found my beauty to be a burden.  Heh.  Not actually a problem I've been struggling with, burdensome beauty, but thank you for asking.  My Aunt Mimi gave me a lot of romantic advice, which was comforting, especially since her marriage lasted for a blissful 60 years.  It's nice to be reassured that extreme pickiness doesn't necessarily lead to years of spinsterhood with no one but stray cats for company.  There were a lot of elderly people doing old-fashioned Russian dances, which reminded me of the scene in  The Sound of Music  where Maria and Captain Von Trapp do the Austrian folk dance.  Megan and I busted out the DVD and watched when I got home.  Our conclusion: Christopher Plummer is S-E-X-X-Y sexy!  He's always yelling and insisting that his children do ridiculous things like march about the grounds, breathing deeply, but then his icy exterior is totally melted by the sassy, young-at-heart governess who blushes furiously when he looks at her.  Any movie where the heroine is considered alluring because she has a tendency to turn eight shades of pink gets, like, 50 bonus points on the Anna Rating Scale.   Megan and I did, however, feel a lot of sympathy for Baroness Schraeder, the icy blond who the Captain jilts when he falls for Maria.  She's, like, 18 times more poised and sophisticated than Maria, and she gets tossed aside for this young, simple thing.  That's gotta feel unfair.  She's a lot like Summer from The O.C., whom we LOVE.  You know who else used to be sexy?   urlLink Howard Dean!   (Check out the pictures Ginny forwarded Megan.)  Give that man the Warren G. Harding Memorial Award for Dreamiest Candidate EVA.  The Anna Primary just got a little closer.  Props to Ginny, by the way, for tackling the vital "Which candidate is sexiest?" issue, which the mainstream media is apparently too scared to touch.  The song lyric that's currently stuck in my head: "The avocado green appliances, with the smell of domestic violences."

      I realized this week that I kinda love my job.  It's a lot like college.  You have to work really hard every once in a while, but you also get to slack off and drink now and again.  They gave me two days off to reward me for staying late last week!  And the crazy thing is, I didn't even mind being at the office past midnight!  I like my job that much!  It's a big change from the Sunday night anxiety attacks teaching gave me.  I think I'd even be really proud of the work I was doing, if I hadn't just left the world's most altruistic job.  I've become obsessed with finding unusual sets that my friends and I belong to.  Ed and I both think the most absurd thing in the Sky Mall catalogue is the guillotine cigar cutter.  Megan, Maggie, Greta, Lindsay and I all run into plate glass windows, doors and mirrors on occasion.  Lauren and I cried when we read the Paul Wellstone chapter of  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.   It's like evidence that I chose the right friends.  Not that I really need any more of that.  For Ed, who loves happy music with sad lyrics: Belle & Sebastian -  urlLink I Don't Love Anyone

      In the last week, I've read two things that started me thinking about discourse: Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them, and David Foster Wallace's  urlLink article on the seamy underbelly of U.S. lexicography .  (Thanks for the recommendation, Jason.)  Franken ends his book by exhorting liberals to give Fox News a taste of its own medicine.   urlLink If all the sane people stay above the fray, he argues, the loonies win.   We should be yelling about how evil the right is, otherwise America will never figure it out!    Wallace, on the other hand, makes the excellent point that it negates the basic premise of democracy to characterize those who disagree with you as evil.  "A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about....   A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.  Isn't that right, Al Franken and Anna Utgoff?"  After I read  Lies , I did my fair share of yelling how evil and malicious Bush is.  When I read the paragraph I just quoted, it spoke to me.  (As did the paragraph about those who "dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow.")  The sad thing is, I think both Franken and Wallace are completely right.  I wish democracy worked better, and that it were easier to respect democratic principles AND win elections.  Sigh.    Incidentally, APDA people, do you guys ever draw from your experience as debaters when you think about the political process?  I have to say, Bush reminds me of a certain debater in particular.  He'll do anything to win, he's sure he's always right, he oversimplifies and belittles those who disagree with him, he's more succesful than intelligent, Megan hated him instantly, and he's always abusing our shared resources (like the shower) in totally gross ways (like for sex).  Hopefully Bush won't be double-TOTY, either.

      I've been at work a lot recently.  The big presentation I'm working on happens tomorrow, though, so things should slow down here soon.  I find it kind of satisfying that I'm helping to build a website that will publicly label people like Nathan Bedford Forrest as terrorists.  For those of you who thought David Duke (y'know, ex-Klan member who ran for president and got elected to the Louisiana legislature) was sane, here's a fact I ran across during last-minute research: Duke wrote a book called  African Atto  under the pseudonym Mohammed X.  It's a manual that advises blacks on how to use street fighting techniques to resist their white oppressors.  It advises blacks to yell "hootoo" when confronted by white people, both to frighten them AND to "rid the body of bad air."  Great googlymoogly, he's a nut.  It pleases me so that Lauren, Ed and Steve are all back in the States.  Kinda funny, since they're still pretty far away from me.  300 miles is better than several thousand, though.  Right now I love: Coffee.

      Two of the three movies I saw this weekend made me cry.  Of course, most movies make me cry these days.  Bad Santa made me cry.  Apparently, I'm not as steely I always thought of myself as being.  The patch probably isn't helping either, if you know what I mean, and I think you do, at least if you are a girl.  Anyway, the two big studio releases I saw both had very simple main ideas, which I will share with you, in case you want to save your $10:   Cold Mountain - If you were going out with Nicole Kidman, or Jude Law, and you got seperated from them, you would be very stubborn about getting back together with them, because they are very attractive.   I mean, look at them!  Everyone else in the whole movie is coated with the grime of war, but they're fucking luminous!    Something's Gotta Give - Here is Jack Nicholson's naked ass.  Here is Diane Keaton, also naked.  Is it not unreasonable that Jack Nicholson's character is considered desirable, while Diane Keaton's character can't find a boyfriend? Isn't the world unfair for older women?  You better agree with us, otherwise we'll show you Jack Nicholson's naked ass again!   I mock, but like I said, both of them got me to tear up.  My company is launching a website formerly known as  urlLink ReadyNet .  It's a nationwide network of first responders that collects and shares best practices for responding to emergencies such as terrorist attacks.  It's being sponsored by DHS, and they're making us change its name, because it's too close to the much-maligned Ready.gov.  If anyone can think of a new name by tomorrow at 5 PM EST, my boss is offering a free dinner for two.  Plus you'll get to say you named the new Ready.gov.  MJ - Whoever is commenting on my blog with the initials MJ, I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are.  I think I remember having heard that story about the bank, but the initials MJ just don't ring a bell with me.  Identify yourself, please.  Right now I love:  Lies, and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , which also made me cry. (The Paul Wellstone chapter.)  I mean, I definitely deserve to be mocked for that, but the book's also very good.

      I agreed to go to the Russian Imperial Ball with my parents.  This is an event organized & attended by people who are  still  mad that the Czar doesn't rule Russia.  As you might have guessed, they're mostly very old.  Sigh.  At least I got to say, "I would come, but I have a ball to go to" to someone yesterday.  My mom called me at work yesterday to ask if she should bother to have my only formal dress dry cleaned.  She thought maybe I'm too fat to fit into it now.  Oh, mom.  She does this to Maggie, too.  Pop quiz: which one of the Utgoff sisters did my mom say looked fat in her prom dress?  Answer: both!  The weird thing is, I don't think she realizes it's mean.  I think she's just trying to help us fix our flaws.  Most of my female friends have similar stories about their moms.  Megan says her mom feels like most people are too polite to tell her she's gained weight.  If your mom doesn't tell you, you'll never know!  At least that's the theory.  The terribly, terribly flawed theory.   Right now I want: some corn bread.  I can put corn bread away, I'm learning.  An Anna-serving of corn bread is about a batch and a half.  Right now I love: Margaret Cho.  Check out the  "Fuck It" Diet , forwarded to me by Megan.

      Mike is trying to convince me to become a LiveJournal user.  I really like Blogger, plus I feel like I should be loyal to them because of  urlLink Jason , but I am tempted by LiveJournal's privacy feature.  It'd be nice to be able to post things that only certain people could read.  For example, I have a hilarious story to tell that involves a two-foot long chocolate bar from England, a phone call from my mother, and the unforunate discovery that my outfit today doesn't have any pockets.  I can't, though, because Sean from work reads my journal now, so I'm trying to limit the degree to which I expose my work-related misadventures on the Internet.  Maybe I can make it up to Jason by beta testing things in the  urlLink Google Lab .  The  urlLink Google Deskbar  is so fantastic!  It totally takes the Google Toolbar to the next level!  Seriously, though, what the HELL is this  urlLink Google Sets  thing?  I spent 15 minutes trying to get it to generate something interesting, but got nothin'.  Right now I love: Speechless, Cibo Matto.  For your amusement: John Williams just sent me an e-mail that begins: "Thank you for the Christmas card, I really, really liked it... not sure if you realized it, but you sent it to me mid-sentence.  It goes 'How do you do that?  Anyway, I'm really'  And that's the end.  I think it's hilarious.  Showed it to Jason and we laughed and laughed.  I was like, aww, so Anna.  Kinda like the sky being particularly blue one day."

      I always lose the "Do you know...?" game, what with having fled Princeton's campus most weekends.  My 80-year-old-man memory doesn't help, either.  Last night, though, I was at Kelly's New Year's party, and Julian's new roommate, Chuck, asked me if I knew  Steve Yuhan .  Um, yeah.  In the Biblical sense, actually.  I feel like that's a walk off grand slam in the "Do you know...?" game.  As Steve put it when I told him, "game 23,958, anna 1."  I have two songs about girls named Anna on my iPod, and they're both very depressing.  This prompted me to go on a search for other Anna songs that are more uplifting.  As it turns out, relationships between songwriters and girls named Anna seldom seem to go well.  I found lots of songs with names like "Anna Cries" and "Anna Lies."  Finally, though, I came across " urlLink Like This Anna " by J-Live.  It's all about how awesome Anna is, and how everyone wants her, but she should remember to respect herself.  There are lots of great lines like, "Your beauty lies not just in your booty."  It's super fun to listen to, at least if your name is Anna.  It reminds me of how Maggie used to insert her name into songs on the radio as she sang along.  "He likes me for me, not because I look like Maggie Utgoff!"    Right now I'm teared up over: the last episode of Futurama.  I want to hear how it ends, too, Fry.

      I have a button on my coat that says "Re-Defeat Bush."  Usually, people think it's a pro-Bush button at first, because it's red, white & blue, and the biggest word on it is "Bush."  Once they get it, though, most people love it.  I get stopped on the Metro by people who want to tell me how great my button is.  It's fantastic.  The reaction to my button got me thinking about how rare overt partisanship is in Washington.  You'd think Washingtonians would be more political than anyone else, but it seems that nonpartisanship a part of professionalism here.  I guess you gotta put your passions aside to do the actual work of governing, especially if you want to survive when the White House changes teams.  You don't see a lot of political posters on the street, and while people like talkin' about the '04 horse race, they don't usually say anything about where their own loyalties lie.  People at my office take an oh-you-young-firebrand-you tone with me.  They think it's odd and naively sweet that I'm an out-of-the-closet Bush hatah.  Right now I love: Maggie.

      Megan got into her safety law school last night.  Because Megan is  insane , her safety school was GEORGETOWN.  Or is U Chicago the safety?  Anyway, the point is, girl, you shout!  Let's everybody welcome her to the legal dream team that will one day defend me against charges of kidnapping Adam Brody and forcing him at gunpoint to do that sweeping-you-off-your-feet bit from last night's episode of  The OC .  And now, a lesson in banter, brought to you by the LEG School of Small Talk  Jeremiah: Anna, what are you wearing?  Your coat looks like a couch!  Anna response (WRONG): Really?  Heh.  (looks sadly at coat)  Lindsay response (RIGHT): Oh yeah?  You look like a couch!  Right now my heroine is totally:  Summer from  The OC .  I second that awww, snap, Seth.

      I'm pleased to announce that John no longer considers TSTSNBN his musical kryptonite.  Ding, dong, the jinx is dead!  I got a Valentine’s Day card from Liz in the mail today.  It was decorated with pink marker.  It made me happy.  Thanks, Liz.  I spent the weekend with Mr. Liz, also known as Mike.  He came down to give a Scientist Talk in Baltimore, which apparently went spectacularly well.  It was great to see him.  He increases the Megan/Anna giggle rate by at least 40%, which is no mean feat.  We went to The Roy’s That Time Forgot, where everyone was at least 70 years old.  They sold commemorative plastic veteran figurines in the 25 cent machine.  (What the fuck! Where did the cent key go?  Stupid keyboard, succumbing to inflationary pressure.)  I resisted the temptation to flirt with the 15 year old cashier who couldn’t look me in the eye, and Megan sifted through the bin of complimentary conversation hearts until she found a mildly insulting one for Mike.  (I got “URA 10”, Leota got “QT” and Mike got “Book Club.”  No, I don’t know why there’s a “Book Club” conversation heart.)  I can’t believe there’s been a Roy’s 8 miles from my house for the last 6 months, and I just now found out about it!  The three of us, plus Ed, also made a cameo appearance at Lindsay’s birthday party, where we got a lesson in small talk from Will and Gibs.  They’re both very good at it.  Fuckin’ extroverts.  Right now I love: The Rusts

      Megan writes, “I was just telling my officemate about how we have been wrecked by songs, and he was like ‘Has Anna ever been taken down by “Anna Begins”? That song works every time! Even for girls who aren't named Anna!’”    Heh.  Yes, actually, I have been taken down by that song.  I was actually thinking about “Anna Begins” this weekend.  ( urlLink listen  or  urlLink read )   urlLink Anna Beth Chao , the  urlLink Everwood  recapper, also  urlLink heard a shout-out  in the use of that song at the end of last week’s  urlLink Ephram Gets Deflowered  episode.  I can’t believe I only just realized that every Anna in the English-speaking world probably has bittersweet "Anna Begins" memories.    This reminds me of an argument I had many times with John Williams over The Song That Shall Not Be Named (TSTSNBN).  John always hears TSTSNBN right before or right after he breaks up with a girl, and he hates it.  It freaks him out when he hears it on the radio, he won’t watch movies that use it, and he doesn’t even let people make jokes about his TSTSNBN phobia.  (For the record, he insists it isn’t a phobia, because phobias are irrational fears, and he thinks his aversion to TSTSNBN is entirely rational.  Fair enough.)    I tried to talk him into giving TSTSNBN another chance when we were in college, and now I’m even more sure that he’s missing out. I don’t think you should try and shut Songs of Tragic Historical Importance out of your life.  I love “Anna Begins,” and I love it because it used to be painful to listen to.  Granted, I also have really nice memories that go with that song.  Someone had to point out to me that it has my name in it, and it was sweet.  (What?  I don't pay close attention to things until I know how they're relevant to me, ok!)  Still, I think it’s the fact that it made me cry once that makes it so pretty now.    Right now I’m waiting for: the guy who uses “Like This Anna” to mack on me.

      Megan and I have been wondering for a long time why guys don't come up to us to talk at parties.  I think we may have figured it out.  It seems to have something to do with fact that we stand in the corner together, pointing at other people and giggling.  We went to two parties this weekend and did just that.  Good times, good times.  At the Valentine's Day party, we both had a little more to drink than was prudent.   Several people who were there assert that I passed out on the couch.  I don't remember any such thing, but that's really not the most compelling defense against charges of aggravated passing out with intent to boot.  Last night I did talk to a few people, but only because the party featured a contest over who had the coolest socks, and I had to do a bit of campaigning for mine.  (And by campaigning, I mean shrilly berating anyone who had better socks.)  After the voting, Ed, Megan and I sat on the couch and talked about how weird it was that Lindsay was talking to other people at the party.  Again, good times.  Before I headed out to this party, I watched Field of Dreams on TBS with Leota.  Every time I see that movie, I like it more.  (I think this is another entry on the ever-growing list of things I love that Lauren introduced me to.  Thanks, L.)  It reminds me of Roger Ebert's review of Joe Versus the Volcano: "I realized a wondrous thing: I had not seen this movie before. Most movies, I have seen before. Most movies, you have seen before. Most movies are constructed out of bits and pieces of other movies, like little engines built from cinematic Erector sets."  I don't understand how they managed to make a movie that's so weird and unique, but that still resonates so deeply with so many people.  It's hard to be original when you're talking about fundamental human desires, because people have been talking about them for the last 6000 years.  Kudos, Field of Dreams.  Watching it makes me really, really wish I liked baseball.  Megan's currently trying to talk me out of joining the company softball team, in what will be my 8714th attempt to cultivate an appreciation for America's game.  Right now I'm listening to:  urlLink The Grey Album . Whoa.  Weird.

      Last night I went drinking in Dupont with Megan, Alyson, and Lindsay.  It was great.  Every phase of my life for the last 10 years was represented.  They got along really well, too, which pleased me to no end.  As an added bonus, the four of us look very comical in public, because we cover a huge height range.  We look like those Russian nesting dolls.  We are a buffet of tallness options!  Whatever your height needs are, we can satisfy them!  If you're shopping for something in a size other than sarcastic, odd, and cynical, though, we don't have much to offer.  Megan, Lindsay and I got a huge kick out of hanging out in Dupont Circle, because everything we did will soon be in walking distance of our apartment!  (Lindsay's going to take over the lease "if" Megan gets into law school.)  The Luna Bar and Grill (which has  sweet potato fries  on the menu) will soon be our neighborhood cafe!  Next time we get shit faced at the Intern Mothership (aka Front Page) we can stumble home in five minutes, instead of forty-five!  Right now my ass is like: ow.  Meetings involve way too much sitting for my taste.

      When I wear something nice, people around the office ask, "Do you have a guitar lesson today?"  Heh.  Megan hadn't heard of " urlLink The Book Of Ratings ," so I forwarded her the link today, and spent a few mintes looking for some of my favorite entries.  For the record, I think Lore Fitzgerald Sjöberg  urlLink deserves oral sex .  I can't resist quoting from his rating of  cookies:  BARNUM CIRCUS ANIMALS Unlike their enfrosted cousins, these are clearly recognizable by species. And as such, they're ideal for that most charming of childhood rituals: slow meticulous dismemberment. Whether head-first or feet-first, animal cookies inevitably go through the sort of torture that makes the movie "Seven" look like a sunny, family-oriented 50's musical. It's fun! B+  SPRINGTIME OREOS I covered Oreos last time, so you may be wondering why I'm touching on these, when they're the same damned cookie, just with light blue centers. My point precisely. Are we such mindless consumers that we're willing to treat Oreos with tinted "stuf" as an entirely different product? Are we willing to sell out the national attention span for the price of a couple drops of blue food coloring? Well, I am, but I was wondering about you. C+  Right now I love: my Aunt Sara, for giving me this shirt that is apparently cute enough for macking on musicians.   Is it cute enough for stuttering at them, I wonder?

       Ginny sent Megan  urlLink a fantastic article about introverts  from The Atlantic Monthly.  It includes many excellent quotes, such as the one I used as the title of this blog post.  I really liked how the author explained the difference between being introverted and being shy, which a lot of people don't get.  Steve, you should print this out and give it to new acquaintances.  Maggie, I think this article is a good explanation of why Scott and I don't always get along.    Incidentaly, I realized when I forwarded this to Sean, my coworker, that it might not be obvious to him that I consider myself an introvert.  I'm way better at feigning gregariousness than I used to be.   I forget sometimes that aging isn't just about getting wrinklier.  People seem to get so much calmer and cooler and smarter with age.  (In case you couldn't tell, when I say "people,"  I mean "Anna.")  So, I went home for dinner yesterday, and discovered that my mom was kind of mad at my dad because he'd been interviewed by CBS News after voting in the Democratic primary, and he'd said some negative things about Bush.  She works for the Bush administration in a pretty high-profile job, and she's worried his fiery liberalism won't go over well at the office.  I felt really bad when I had to tell her that I'd described the administration as "decietful" and "belligerent" on Voice of America International Radio.  I can't believe that both my dad and I were randomly chosen by global media outlets to express our opinion of George W. Bush!  What an amazing (and sucky, for my mom) coincidence.  Right now I love: soy nuts.  So salty and protein-rich!  Fictional character I'm currently over-empathizing with: Rory Gilmore.  Damn you, Jess!

      Megan and I found a new place!  It's beautiful.  It's on Embassy Row, three blocks from Dupont Circle, and it's huge, and quiet, and sunny, and I love it with all my heart.  I want to marry it and have beautiful, spacious two-bedroom babies with it.  I'm finally going to live in the cool part of a city, instead of in the burbs or the ghetto.  And we found it on the first day we went looking.  I thought I was going to spend all of February pounding the pavement and agonizing over whether or not to take mediocre apartments.  Thanks, Universe!  I owe you one!  I'm excited about moving, but also a little apprehensive.  March 1st is shaping up to be my D-Day, and it's going to require only slightly less planning than the invasion of Normandy.  I'm moving into a new apartment, I'm moving into a new office building, I have a huge deadline for a project I'm working on, and I turn 25.  Kerazy.  Right now I love: my new apartment!

      I had a very surreal morning.  I went to vote in the Democratic primary today, and I ran into Emily Bernstien-Messner, a debater I knew way back in the day.  I'd thought I'd seen her on the street a couple of times, but concluded that it couldn't be her, because she didn't seem to recognize me.  It turns out she'd seen me, too, but decided it couldn't be me because I didn't say hi.  D'oh.  Anyway, she was about to be interviewed by a correspondent for Voice of America, and he asked if he could interview me, too.  Hee!  My hatred of GWB is currently being broadcast across the world on radio stations funded by the U.S. taxpayer.  Double hee!  If I can find the broadcast online, I'll post it.  Right now I love: The Stills, who for some reason always get compared to Interpol, who I like much less.  (By the way, my ex-roommate kissed the lead singer of Interpol when they were both in high school!  He was her high school crush!  Honestly, my little foray into rock criticism was totally just an excuse to share this anecdote.  My roommate hooked up with a rock star!)

      Today I had lunch with Alyson Klein, one of my old TFA comrades.  She confessed, somewhat bashfully, that she reads my blog, and asked if that was ok.  Are you kidding, Alyson?  I love finding out that my friends read my blog.  Please, continue to suckle at the teat of Big Anna's propaganda machine!  Alyson also deserves a shout-out for noticing that I'd written into  urlLink The Vine .   She knew it was me, even though it's an anonymous advice column!  She says both the writing style and the problem I wrote about were very Anna.  Heh.  True dat, Alyson.  Right now I'm shocked by: the discovery that prisoners on death row have a $20 limit on their last meal.  On TV it's always lobster and chocolate mousse and gourmet food like that!  Is it really necessary to cheap out on someone's last meal?  I realize this probably goes fairly low on the list of problems with our country's capital punishment system, but it still really upsets me.  Every time I see someone executed in a movie, I think, well, at least they get to eat that really delicious looking steak!  Mmmmmm, steak.....

      I was listening to "Opposites Attract" at the gym today, and it occurred to me that M.C. Kat is NOT good enough for Paula Abdul.  He's on the sucky side of all their yin/yang conflicts.  He's broke, messy, regressive, obsessive, and a smoker.  Why didn't this occur to me when Phyllis, Mike, Heather and I were performing an electric slide-style line dance to this song for 300 beaming parents at the Belvedere Elementary Valentine's Day Dance Exhibition?  I guess back then I didn't have enough experience with women selling themselves short to recognize that Paula had a problem.   These days, though, I know a lot of amazing girls who adhere to the Opposites Attract Theory.  They're fantastic, and they fall for people who are the opposite of fantastic.  Right now I'm enjoying: the salty, delicious taste of Baked Cool Ranch Doritos.  Why is it necessary to fry regular Doritos if the baked ones taste that good?

      Three things I've been unable to do in moderation this week: sleep, eat cornbread, and listen to "God Only Knows" by The Beach Boys.  Corn bread is so delicious and inexpensive!  Probably something to do with evil, evil agricultural subsidies.  Best not to think about that.  And The Beach Boys are actually kinda dark.  I keep reading about how  Pet Sounds  is one of the best albums ever, so I gave it another listen, and it IS good.  As much as I enjoyed "Kokomo" when I was 8, it's not actually The Beach Boys' best work.  Also, Brian Wilson's Salieri-like obsession with The Beatles is really funny to me for some reason.  Probably not for him, what with the nervous breakdown after hearing  Sgt. Pepper .  But I have this mental picture of him on his knees, hands clutching at his skull, listening to  Sgt. Pepper  on his headphones and screaming "Noooooooooooooooooo!" at the sky.  It makes me chuckle.  If this isn't funny to you, check to see if the Brian Wilson in your head has a beard.  See?  Sad beard man = funny.  Right now I'm debating: whether or not to make more corn bread.  I've been wandering about the house moaning "coooooooooooooooorn breaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad" in the same tone of voice in which zombies demand brains.  The problem is, I seem to be unable to limit myself to fewer than 1,500 calories of corn bread a day when it's sitting on the counter, emitting that siren-like smell.

      I spent the weekend in NY, and it was great.  I really, really miss sitting on the couch for hours and shooting the shit with Lauren, Ed & Steve.  This weekend, while doing just that, we took the  urlLink PresidentMatch.com  quiz.  Apparently the candidate that best matches us, ideologically-speaking, is either Dennis Kucinich or Al Sharpton.  All of us, plus Lindsay, ranked them 1-2.  I guess that's what happens when you're 8000 miles left of center: the only politicians who agree with you are the loonies.  We were unable to bring the 245 E 11th Street Primary to a decisive conclusion, though, because we couldn't agree on who should head the ticket: Martian or race-baiter?  Ed and I were pro-Sharpton, Lindsay and Lauren picked Kucinich, and when Steve took the quiz, they tied at 100%.  I did lots of fun NY stuff between couch marathons.  I went shopping at Century 21 and Beacon's Closet, had bagels & lox at the 2nd Avenue Deli, bought a book at The Strand, and hit up day 1 of the  urlLink City Bakery's Hot Chocolate Festival .  I'd never had their hot chocolate before.  All I can say is, wow.  They are to chocolate what Ti-Couz is to crepes.  They have beer-flavored hot chocolate!  Wacky.  On the way home, Lindsay and I listened to Fiona Apple and traded sad stories.  I love that moment in a friendship where you find out about The Shit that went down before you were around.  It's like when you start watching a TV show in the middle of its run, and then you finally get to see the pilot episode.  Everything's a bit clearer.

      So, as I've said before, my new apartment is great.  The blush of new love is wearing off, though, and I'm starting to realize that it's not quite perfect.  It has flaws, and they are threefold:   We've got bugs.  They're cute bugs, though.  We've got these moths that flutter around in an aimless way and bump into things.  It's actually very Megan-and-Anna.  I also found a lady bug in my room the other day.  The people who live next door have LOUD sex.  Like, really loud.  The first time I heard it I thought they might just be fucking with me, they were making such cartoonishly exaggerated orgasm noises.  So far, it's only in the afternoon, and it's amusing.  I'm guessing I'll be annoyed by this within a month, though.  Maybe I can find a way to break them up.    Ooh, I could be the guy's rebound hookup, too!  My neighbor knows how to please a woman, let me tell you.  There's a homeless guy who sneaks in and sleeps in our hallway sometimes.  There's not really an upside to this one.  He's smelly, and it's depressing, and I feel like a jerk calling the building manager to get him kicked out on the street again.  I still love you, though, apartment.

      So, I'm glad to see you're all waiting on the edge of your seats to find out who won the sushi eating contest.  Anticipation was running high here at the office, too.  Very little work was done on Friday afternoon, what with all the betting and speculating and smack talking.  My colleague and competitor, Bill, sent this e-mail to the entire office:  "I liken this whole event to the democratic party's nomination race. Mike is the John Edwards; all sunny disposition and movie-star looks, but too genial and inexperienced to play with the big boys, and hence, a perennial also-ran.  Anna stands as the Howard Dean; her bluster and trash talk have redefined the contest, but ultimately her gluttony campaign will implode (as her stomach explodes) with a loud, well-televised scream of pain after the 10th plate of California rolls. I see myself as the John Kerry; haggard, seemingly forgotten, but suddenly, with a quick jab of Botox, capable of embracing a methodical, plodding style that will eventually trample his competition underfoot and lead to office bragging rights and glory.    As Kerry would say...       Bring it on,       Bill"  Clearly, Bill needed to be taken down a peg.  I'm pleased to report that I was able to do just that.  I didn't defeat Mike (the aforeblogged 6'4" ex-frat boy), but it was neck and neck until the very end.  Bill at 44 pieces of sushi, I ate 57, and Mike ate 58.  When you compare body mass to sushi consumption, I was the clear winner, and all the spectators said my performance was impressive.  I am, however, dissatisfied by this less than total victory, so I'm going to begin the patented Kobayashi training regimen as soon as my stomach recovers.  I will NOT be defeated at the upcoming Chipotle burrito throw down.  Right now I'm eagerly anticipating: seeing the pictures from the sushi battle royale, which Sean's girlfriend is going to e-mail him at work sometime this afternoon.  I'll post them, unless they're really unflattering, which they probably are.  If I look gluttonously cute, though, you'll all get to see.

      I've challenged two of my officemates to a sushi eating contest, and it goes down tonight.  I have talked _so_ much smack over the past two weeks that a lot of people are betting on me to win, even though one of my competitors is a 6'4" ex-frat boy.  I want this title, and I want it bad.  I even did some research into how Kobayashi trains.  For those of you who don't know, Kobayashi is that little Japanese guy who dominates those hot dog eating contests they have every year in New York.  Apparently, he eats HUGE meals of only cabbage for months before the contest.  Cabbage is high in fiber and takes a long time to digest, so it really stretches his stomach out.  I'm thinking of going on the Kobayashi regimen, just because I think it'd be awesome to be able to put away an entire ham and have room left for dessert.  That'd be a cool party trick.

      I didn't post yesterday for two reasons:  1. I used my free time at work obsessing over the Hollywood Stock Exchange.  Lauren was just joining when I was up in NY last time, so I blame her for this.  I took a bath on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which I bought a shitload of because I love it ever so much.  I heart that movie and I want to marry it and then divorce it and then have all my memories of it erased and then go see it and fall in love with it all over again.  Dog of a stock, though.  2. I was preoccupied by a Horribly Disturbing Incident, which I felt I should not post about.  I have since dissolved my ties with the party responsible for the Horribly Disturbing Incident, though, so I can share the gist of it.  I got hit on by a married guy!  And he's old!  And has two kids!  He offered me a ride home from some volunteering we were both doing, and his car had two kiddy safety seats in the back!  And then he tried to get me drunk and seduce me!  When he asked if I wanted a drink I thought he wanted to get coffee and discuss ways in which I could use my computer skills to help his organization.  No!  That is not at all what he meant!  I'm so stupid.  Fortunately, I'm not stupid enough to fall for the line, "Sometimes giving into your emotions seems irrational, but really, it's the people who always do the sensible thing that lead unhappy lives."  I need to take, like, a thousand showers.  Bleach showers.  Right now I'm amused by myself because: I sold Jim Cavaziel short.  I have no faith in you or your HSX StarBond, Jesus.

      Megan has been in England for less than a week, and already I've descended into a state of lonely lunacy.  I go to bed at seven, and then wake up around two and have pickles, corn bread and fudgesicles for dinner.   I'm still waiting for Comcast to come make my TV work (free cable ended Sunday, Megs) so I've been spending a LOT of time staring at computer screens.  There have also been a few Anna-only dance parties.  Luckily Lindsay is still around, and she's dragged me out of the house a few times. On Tuesday I went to the best indie movie theater in DC, which is only two blocks from my new apartment.  Gibs, Julian, J's roommate and I saw  urlLink The Lost Boys of Sudan , a documentary about orphaned teenage boys from Sudan who are resettled in the United States.  It's nice of the US Government to offer these kids asylum, but is it really a good idea to deposit them in Nebraska or Texas with virtually no support network?  In any case, the movie was fascinating, heartwrenching, and funny.  Apparently, even spending several months in a UN refugee camp will not make airline food seem appealing.  Right now I'm excited about: seeing the Magnetic Fields live!  Right now I miss New York because: Sars is doing a reading there tomorrow!  Damn.

      Today's Washington Post has  urlLink an interesting article  about what a complicated issue same-sex marriage is for black leaders, "because it pits two pillars of the black community -- progressive activism and conservative morality, both nurtured in the black church -- squarely against each other."  Many black leaders, particularly within the clergy, feel that they can't support the struggle for gay rights because the Bible says homosexuality is wrong.  Coincidentally, this is the second time in the past few days that I've read about a group that felt compelled by the Bible's picture of right and wrong.  The Phineas Priests are a terrorist organization that one joins by committing a violent act against gays, abortion doctors, or interracial couples.  Phineas Priests do this, they claim, because the Bible tells them to.  They're right.  The Bible does say that killing interracial couples makes God happy.  In Numbers 25:6-13, Phineas stabs an Israelite man and a Mideanite woman through the gut with a javelin because he finds their interracial relationship to be immoral.  God is so pleased that he saves the Israelites from a plague and elevates Phineas to the high priesthood.  Generally, I don't bother to argue with people who say they're doing what they do because God told them to.  It's really disappointing, though, to see some of MLK's peers sitting on the sidelines of the struggle for gay rights.  Yes, the Bible tells you to, but the Bible also tells the Phineas Priests to kill black people who date white people.  The Bible's a good book, but it's not a good defense for your actions, or your inaction.  Right now I miss: Megan

      I saw Mike Doughty with Aaron, Neil, Ryan, Kate & Steph tonight.  Anyone who covers both Mary J. Blige and The Magnetic Fields is aces in my book.     Megan and I have lived in this apartment for two weeks, and we have yet to figure out where to throw away the trash.  We're just keeping it all in a big pile.  We have a Trash Room.  I've been ignoring the Trash Room because I have a sneaking suspicion that the dumpster is outside, which means it's going to take me several hours to carry it all down there.  As long as I'm not sure where the trash goes, I have an excuse for not dealing with it.  I should not have children, ever.  Right now I love: The Book of Ratings  Edited to add: Neil, I'm sorry I spelled your name wrong.  (I've since corrected it.  Twice.)

      I was almost killed by a couch today.  My parents and I were moving a  monstrosity  of a sofa into my apartment, and I tried to step over the side of a truck bed while still holding up my end.  Instead, I ended up falling several feet, slamming my head into the concrete, and dropping the couch.  It almost fell on me!  It was terrifying!  So now I have this sofa that tried to crush me to death sitting here in my apartment.  I'm afraid to move it again, ever, because that will give it the chance to finish the job.  On the other hand, I'm a bit nervous about letting it stay here.  Megan's in England, and I dunno about sleeping alone in the apartment with this murderous piece of furniture.  I don't trust it.  I bet it's made out of bones dug up from an Indian burial ground, or something equally curse-tastic.   It is an EVIL sofa.   Right now I'm thankful for: my skull, which remains intact, despite the best efforts of a certain sofa.

Speaking of finding fullfillment by acquiring things, Lauren and Ed are all in the glow of having found a perfect apartment.

      I have power!  It's very exciting.  Pepco decided, for no apparent reason, to cut off the power to our apartment despite the fact that our landlord hadn't asked them to.  Then they decided to make getting the power turned on only slightly less complicated than robbing a casino on fight night.  Then they decided that even though we'd jumped through all their hoops, they weren't going to turn on our power for another day or so, just for fun.  Apparently, when the Pepco crews leave for the day, their managers have no idea where they're going or what they're going to do.  They might hook some people up with power, but they might also go home and watch soaps all day.  Stupid utility monopoly.  That said, my new aparment rocks.  Megan and I ate at Sushi Taro on a whim last night, and then wandered around Dupont cooing lovingly at our new neighborhood.  DC is welcoming us with a week of 60 degree+ weather, and it's lovely.

      Lindsay and I went shopping with Kelly yesterday, and I bought a shirt with a picture of a hamburger on it.  It's pink, and the back says "Yummy!" so I'm a little worried that the t-shirt is comparing me to a peice of meat, instead of sending the message that I like hamburgers.  Lauren (from work) said it was weird for me to wear it because I eat a lot of soy, and then Lindsay and Lauren had a long discussion about how people who eat soy but are not vegetarians are suspicious and untrustworthy.  Whatever.  Isoflavones, people!  After shopping Lindsay and I saw 13 going on 30, and we both teared up.  I take this as evidence of my corrupting influence on Gibs, who generally hates chick flicks with the burning hatred of a thousand white-hot suns.  Jennifer Garner is just adorable on stilts!  I want her to come have a slumber party with me during which she gives speeches about how I'm pretty and smart and great, and we sing "Love Is A Battlefield" using hairbrushes as microphones.  Also, Mark Ruffalo!  We're so lucky to be living in an age where he and Luke Wilson are the go-to guys for the role of Sensitive Boyfriend Who Hangs His Head Shyly During Speeches About How He Loves You.  Today I went to the March for Women's Rights, but failed to meet up with anyone I know due to the generally relaxed attitude with which we all approach plan-making.  Like, I don't even believe in making plans.  Whatever happens, happens, y'know?  I did a symbolic jaunt down the mall, got glared at by some people holding signs that said "Women Need Love, Not Abortion" and then went home and took a nap, leaving others to take care of the whole right to choose thing.  I'm sure they have it under control.  Right now I love: Mark Ruffalo

Plus, my iPod is better at making me happy than 95% of the people I know.  (Of course not you!  I meant those other losers.)  I totally heart it.  The  urlLink Washington Post article  about boy space friends  urlLink reminded Steve  of Steve, too.  I've often thought that Steve should write a book about how to turn a girl friend into a girlfriend.  I've seen it tried often, but I've only seen it work once.  Megan could co-write it with him, and contribute several chapters on what NOT to do, because she's been the target of many friend seductions gone horribly wrong.   I'm actually only half-kidding about this.  I've since realized that there are about 18 things that Steve does right that everyone else does wrong.  Kudos, Yuhan.  Lindsay and I went to an Orioles game last night.  We got my boss's season tickets, which are right on the first base line, about 6 rows back.  We were close enough to definitively determine which Oriole is cutest.  (It's  urlLink Javy Lopez .)  We had hot dogs, and the Orioles mascot put Lindsay's head in his mouth.  Oh, baseball.  So boring, and yet the inspiration for so much that is loveable.  Right now I love: Greta, for being the stubborn counterexample to my romantic pessimism

      The last few days have left me feeling very pessimistic about love.  The fiancé of a good friend of mine flipped out, and the wedding, which was in three weeks, has been cancelled.  The girl is amazing, and if this can happen to her, it can happen to anyone.  I also came across an  urlLink article about the pain of being a guy in love with an oblivious female friend , which, evidently, is a common predicament.  All this got me thinking about men, and women, and how they interact, and the (infinitesimal?) chance that said interaction will lead to happiness for both parties.  Suddenly, a million stupid War of The Sexes clichés seem like inarguable truths.   Right now I love: tequila shots.  They are the Elixer of Truth.

Reminiscent of the region of Eastern Europe, or the people residing therein.  2.  Of the past.  Acid washed jeans, oppressive concrete apartment complexes, and pyramid schemes are FRY.  Coalition building is  totally  FRY.  Megan and I had a bit of a hootenanny this weekend.  It was a very Megan&Anna party.  We set the sangria on fire, and then had to serve it in the blender and the coffee pot, because we don't own a pitcher.

I wasn't the only person there at Adam Brody's behest, from the look of the crowd.  The girl standing right next to looked like she was going to a costume party as Summer.  Anyway, the show was great, and DCFC was charmingly polite and awkward.  They said thank you after every single round of applause.  After the concert, we went to Ben's and had milkshakes, and then I tried to pimp Lindsay out to some drunken slavs.  Allow me to explain.  Lindsay forgot it was daylight savings, and missed the last Metro train.  She was really mad about having to pay $20 for a cab all the way back to the boonies.  While we were standing on the corner of U & 14th trying to hail a taxi, these sketchy-looking eastern European guys came up to us and asked us to go into a "swingers club" with them.  Apparently you need a female escort to get in.  They kept begging and offering to buy us drinks and telling us we could leave in five minutes.  I'm a consultant, which means I never miss the opportunity to leverage assets, so I asked them if they were willing to pay Lindsay's cab fare home in exchange for 10 minutes of our company.  Lindsay, however, was not interested in hooking for taxi money, and shoved me into a cab before I could seal the deal.  If only I had sluttier friends, I'd probably have a Heidi Fleiss-style prostitution empire by now.  Damn you, Lindsay!  Right now I love: Costco.

Make sure to see it on opening night in a theater full of hip, politically aware people who are going to laugh at the right bits.  Take your snarky liberal friends, and cheer when Fake President Bush reacts to news of the apocalypse by asking Fake Vice President Cheney "What do YOU think we should do?"  I know, I know, it looks awful.  Seriously, though, you can't pass up what will almost certainly be your only opportunity ever to see Dick Cheney apologize to the third world.

      Last night Lauren,  urlLink Jason ,  urlLink Steve , Lindsay and I all went to an O’s Game.  Unfortunately for us, the apocalypse arrived in Baltimore around the end of the 2nd inning.  It came in the form of the craziest thunderstorm I’ve seen in a decade.  We spent an hour huddled under the lip of the upper deck with several thousand other baseball fans.  The dugout was completely filled with water, and the sky turned green.  It was nutty.  People were literally  shrieking  in terror.  Goldie, Gibs, Steve & Laur are a pretty quality group of people to be trapped in a rainstorm with, though.     Later that night we braved the cicadas and hung out with Julian and Willie on my stoop.  We ate vegetarian sausuage, talked about the constitution, and activated the self-heating packet from a " urlLink Heater Meal " to satisfy our scientific curiosity. Good, nerdsome fun, that.  I’d forgotten to tell Megan that Jason might be staying with us, so she was a bit surprised when she saw him on the couch this morning.  Because Megan is a sitcom character, her reaction was a blood-curdling scream.  Jason just shrugged and said, "fair enough." Aw, Goldie.  With a deapan wit like that, he really fits into our situation comedy lifestyle.  We’re totally bringing him back for the very special sweeps episode of  2222 Q , where all my friends stage an intervention because my corn bread addiction has finally gone too far.

Apparently, Lemony Snickett, the author of  A Series of Unfortunate Events , played the accordion on 69 Love Songs.  To return the favor Stephen Merritt composed several songs for the audio book versions of the Snickett series.  That's awesome.  Those books are great -- not quite as good as the Harry Potter books, because they're written for a younger audience, but still terrific.  I guess I know what to read my kids when I'm a hip mom.  Right now I love: "I Don't Really Love You Anymore" from The Magnetic Fields' new album.

      New York was great, as always.  The Magnetic Fields rocked, albeit a bit too quietly for my taste.  I did love their opening act, though.   His name is  urlLink Andrew Bird , and he is SO my new boyfriend.  He was so good that I found everything he did and said completely charming.  For example, I think it's adorable that he raises chickens in a barn on the Mississippi River.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't find chicken farming a turn on in any other context.  I'm happy to say that the rest of the weekend lived up to the standard of excellence set by the concert.  The highlights included all-you-can-eat baby samosas, a karaoke performance of Ebony & Ivory, a second viewing of Mean Girls, and shots of rum taken straight from the bottle.   Right now I love: Lauren & Ed, for letting me crash on their couch, again.  You guys are the best.

      Lindsay and I ate at  urlLink the Brickskeller  last night.  They have the best non-sweet potato fries in DC.  We talked about the bright side of having your heart broken, and then I tried to convince Lindsay to read the Harry Potter books.  I think I might have won her over by pointing out that if she hates them, she can argue with people who love them.   She’s an ornery girl, god love her.  Afterwards we met some hipsters who live in our building.  One of them has thick-framed Weezer glasses, and the other one wears a trucker hat.  They have PBR at their parties, which is apparently all the rage among the Connecticut Avenue smart set.  (Don’t quote me on that, though.  Recent reports indicate that bad beer is totally FRY.   urlLink Heather  says wine coolers are the new so-bad-it’s-cool drink.)  They were funny, and I think we’ll be friends, although Megan asserts that one of them is smelly.  It’s not inconceivable.  They might be too hip for cleanliness.  Deodorant is totally a tool the man uses to make us all smell the same!  Fight the power!  Right now I love: The Magnetic Fields.  I hope their live show doesn’t disappoint, although I don’t see how it could fail to, given how much I love them.

      I got called into work because of a terrorism emergency this weekend.  Yay, I'm important!  The emergency in question was a threat that  urlLink Revolutionary Struggle  (a Greek group) made to attack foreigners attending the 2004 Athens Olympics.  Yoni once asked me if I had any expert terrorism predictions, and at the time, I didn't. Now I do.  The Olympics are going to be attacked.  It's going to happen.  The only reason you're not seeing more panic in the press it that it's not widely known that Greece has one of the most serious domestic terrorism problems in the world.  Greek twentysomethings HATE America, and they LOVE to bomb American businesses and diplomatic targets.  The American embassy in Athens spends more on security than any other embassy in the world (although I'm guessing Baghdad has recently claimed that title).  Greek terrorists aren't advanced enough to stage attacks outside of Greece, but luckily for them, we're bringing thousands upon thousands of Americans and American TV cameras to their doorstep.  The Greek government claims that the arrest and trial of several members of  urlLink November 17  (the most notorious Greek terrorist group) ended the threat of terrorism in Greece, but the attacks have continued.  This is unsurprising, given the total incompetence of Greek police, who have been known to give away evidence at the scene of crimes to passersby who want souvenirs.  Ominously, Greek terrorists have a history of collaborating with organizations that pose a more serious threat, like the PLO.  If some enterprising Al-Qaeda affiliate wants to start shit in Athens this August, they're going to find plenty of young, angry Greeks who are willing to help.   Right now I love: The  urlLink Terrorism Knowledge Base , the website I've been working on for the past eight months.

       I've been looking for examples of marriages that work recently, because sometimes it seems like there are none.  According to  urlLink Fametracker , Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt fit the bill.  FT recently described them as "a pairing so apparently happy and well-matched that they draw comparisons to Newman and Woodward and have the whole world press clamoring for them to deliver unto the world their perfect golden progeny."  It's convenient to find a happy married couple in Hollywood, because they're so easy to spy on.  The publicity blitz for Troy has included dozens of pictures of them looking blissful.  I know, I know: they're actors who get paid to pretend to lead perfect lives, plus there are rumors that Pitt slept with Angelina Jolie (how could you not, if you had the chance?), plus it's kinda creepy and voyeuristic to follow celebrity relationships.  I don't care, and shut up!  I like believing that they have perfect lives, because that means perfect lives are possible.  In the spirit of my newfound affection for Brad Pitt, I went to see Troy with my work friends last night.  Not great, unfortunately.  The rumors of Brad Pitt's divine radiance are true, and the fight scene between Hector and Achilles is fantastic, but otherwise it's lame.  I don't understand why they cast someone so generic and boring as Helen.  It seems like the sort of role that screams for an icon.  What about Nicole Kidman, or Halle Berry, or Jennifer Connelly, or Thandie Newton?  I hear Angelina Jolie is at Brad Pitt's beck and call.  My coworker Mike argued that these women wouldn't have worked because part of what makes them beautiful is their intelligence and class, and that's not what you want for Helen of Troy.  I say nuts to that.

      I _heart_ the Blogger Relaunch.  It's so pretty and intuitive and feature-riffic.  I couldn't resist republishing using one of the new templates.  I'm also switching to the new Blogger comments tool, in part because it makes more sense to bring all my blog content under one umbrella, and in part because I lost all the old comments when republishing my blog.  D'oh.  I'm currently trying to figure out how to download them all, but that might not work.  My apologies to all of you who made witty remarks on my blog.  Also, I know I claimed this would happen a while ago, but now it's really true: my blog is accessible at ffoggy.com.   urlLink Try it .  Neat, huh?  Right now I love: Blogger!  And not just because my friend works there, and they're owned by Google, which is about to IPO and make all its employees piles of money.  That has NOTHING to do with it.

      FYI, nail polish remover is the best way to get stamp ink off your hands.  This will come in handy if you ever wake up two and a half hours late and realize that you have an important meeting at work in half an hour, and your hair smells like you slept inside a giant ashtray, and your hands have two HUGE stamps of shame on them because you couldn't prove that you're 21 to the bouncer last night, because you STILL haven't gotten your liscense renewed.  Do not, I repeat, do NOT attempt to scrub the stamps off, because they won't come off, and you will become increasingly panicked by the prospect of having to show up at work two hours late with hand stamps that scream "I'm late because I was out PARTYING," and you'll scrub until your hands are alarmingly red, and when you finally do realize nail polish remover is the key that will only make the redness worse, and people at work will ask why your hands are so red, and the jig will be up.  You will be caught red handed, as it were.    Right now I love: nail polish remover

       My boss forwarded me a link to the  urlLink International Federation of Competitive Eating .  I want to BE  urlLink Sonya Thomas .  The girl can eat 43 soft tacos in 11 minutes!  And she weighs 105 pounds!  I feel compelled to quote her IFOCE bio in full:  "There is an century-old prophesy within the competitive eating community, dismissed by most, that foretells the rise of the 'One Eater,' a woman who will electrify America's gurgitators and lead them to international victory once again. Like Joan of Arc before her, this eater will be slender of stature, but mighty in strength. In recent months, the prophesy has been mentioned more and more frequently as the eaters have watched Sonya Thomas excel in nearly every contest she enters.  This amazing newcomer is odds-on favorite for IFOCE 2003 Rookie of the Year. She has quickly mastered the sport and the rest of the eaters appear to be watching, dumfounded, seemingly waiting for her to assume her rightful position at the top of the game."  If I can't be Sonya Thomas, I want to be  urlLink Carlene LeFevre :  "Carlene LeFevre is one of the most charming and elegant eaters on the circuit. She frequently can be seen reapplying her lipstick immediately following a contest, using the side of a knife as a mirror. Nonetheless, Carlene is a fierce and highly focused competitor who releases excess energy by poppping up and down as she eats. This activity, known as 'The Carlene Pop,' also helps to tamp down the food in her stomach, releasing any air pockets."  Right now I love: the fact that my boss sends me e-mail about competitive eating.

      This weekend Lindsay hosted a 13 Going on 30 style sleepover, attended by me, Megan, Alyson and Kelly.  It was fantastic.  We played a game called "the Nail Game."  One of Tony's friends told me about it when I was in NY, but I didn't think I'd ever get to play because you need a stump.  Bizarrely, Lindsay has a stump at her apartment, for reasons which are still not entirely clear to me.  Anyway, this is how you play the Nail Game:     Everyone gets a nail, and you sit around a stump taking turns trying to hammer the other people's nails in.   If you miss, you drink.   If you bend a nail, you do a shot. If your nail gets hammered all the way in, you chug your drink.  The Nail Game involves a lot of crazy strategizing and coalition building, especially if you're as bad at hammering as we are, because it takes the cooperative efforts of several people through several rounds to get one nail hammered in.  I highly recommend it, if you happen to have a stump, a hammer, several nails and a large quantity of alcohol on hand.  Right now I love: Mean Girls

      By way of Megan:  "The fellas[owen and vince]were spotted at the Four Seasons in Georgetown crashing a Republican fundraiser after-party, no less, Wednesday night. Our spy, who declined to be identified, told us she ribbed the two: 'You can only go in if you're a Republican,' and Vince responded, "I am one," noting that no one ever believes him when he says that, including our spy.'  I can't believe I missed a chance to crash a Republican fundraiser with Vince & Owen.  As if that weren't enough of a kick in the teeth, Heather sent me this tidbit from  urlLink Wonkette :  "Yesterday [5/4] as I am walking north on Thomas Jefferson toward M, I nearly collide with Owen Wilson jogging on the C&O tow path. Blue t-shirt, blue shorts, floppy blonde hair and that nose. In tow was a cute bulldog-like dog who seemed intent on peeing every 50 feet or so. Owen appeared to be in a very good mood."  So I missed a cheerful, floppy-haired Owen Wilson jogging in FLIP FLOPS, accompanied by a CUTE DOG.  That ain't right.  Right now I'm feelin': the best Dylan McKay quote ever - "May the bridges I burn light my way."

      I went for a drink with Gibs and Dave tonight.  It was great.  We had a long, interesting argument about whether or not the people you fantasize about are the ones you're supposed to be with.  Gibs says no -- she thinks infatuation leaves you so blind to their flaws that you're never going to make anything real work with them.  I think that's often true, but on the other hand, how can you be with someone you feel lukewarm about when you know there are people out there who just totally, completely, effortlessly work you?  Last night I made a new friend.  Her name is Gabrielle, and she lives in my building.  We met a few weeks ago, actually, when she found my wallet on the street.  She called me and returned it to me, and we discovered that we both went to the same high school.  Crazy, huh?  Last night, she ran into me and Lindsay on the steps while we were talking about the movie that's filming in our neighborhood.  It stars Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson! They were on our street, and we missed them!  Anyway, Gabrielle found this as screech-inducingly ridiculous as we did, so we all decided to go out on the town and hunt for them.  We didn't find them, but we had a good time looking.  I like the idea of having a friend whom I only hang out with under ridiculous circumstances.  It makes my life seem more like a TV show, and what's better than being like people on TV? Certainly nothing I can think of.  Right now I love: Megan, who had a dream in which she met Henry Kissinger (I threw her a pool party and invited him), but it was really awkward because she kept accidentally bringing up Cambodia.  That _would_ be awkward!

       It's strange how the things that make you cry change.  Megan and I were watching  To Kill a Mockingbird,  and we both teared up when Scout meets Boo Radley for the first time.    I've seen that movie at least 4 times, and I don't ever remember being affected by that scene before.  Maybe I'm becoming more sensitive to the rich tapestry of human emotions as I mature.   Either that or I'm afraid I'm going to end up a crazy shut-in whose contact with the outside world is limited spying on other people's children.  The movie prompted a discussion between me and Megan about whether or not Atticus Finch is sexy.  He's a great father figure, clearly, but does that make him attractive?  Megan compared him to Victor Laszlo -- so chock full of integrity that it's hard to imagine him as a suitable partner for anything really down and dirty.  On the other hand,  I suppose you sort of want the father of your children to be brimming with moral clarity and all that.   Maybe it's that you get a limited amount of time to goof off with the Humphrey Bogarts of the world, and then you find your Atticus Finch to settle down with.   Or maybe it's that if you pick the right guy, he turns into an Atticus Finch type just as you're ready to start explaining to your kids why it's not OK to kill mockingbirds, but you still want to make out with him because you remember what he was like when he lived above a saloon and drank bourbon for breakfast.  I need to figure this out, because it clearly has serious implications for the "Abraham Lincoln: Hot or Not?" debate.  Also for my life, but whatever.  Right now I love: drinkin'

       Last night Lindsay and I went to Iota to see  urlLink Iron and Wine , aka Sam Beam.  He was very good, in an extremely quiet and serious way.  Man, do hip suburbanites love folksy acoustic guitar ballads about death!  You could've cut the hushed reverence with a knife.  FYI, Sub Pop offers a  urlLink free download  of one of Mr. Beam's new songs, "Naked As We Came."   urlLink The video  is also excellent. It's even prettier and more depressing than the song, which is quite a feat.  So, I think we need to invent a new word to describe the cyberspace dominance by one word over all its homonyms.  I propose "Google shadow."  The classic example is Macintosh Apples (the fruit), which are in the Google shadow of Apple computers.  Go ahead,  urlLink Google "Macintosh Apples,"  and see how many pages you have to click through to find information on fruit.  I'm bringing this up because I was trying to research the song  Shakara , which is in the Google shadow of Victoria's Secret Model Shakara Ledard.  I still have no idea what the word "Shakara" means, because I lost interest after seeing approximately 2,708 pictures of Ms. Ledard in a push-up bra.  Right now I am charmed by: my own hilarious ineptitude.  More to follow tomorrow.

      On Tuesday, I realized a lifelong dream and saw  Casablanca  on the big screen.  OK, so I've only been dreaming of this for the past six months or so, but it was still pretty exciting.  I'd forgotten how witty the movie is.  Dooley Wilson's reaction shot the third time he gets asked to play "As Time Goes By" is hilarious. Plus, Bogie makes a threesome joke!  Dirrrrrrrrty!  During the car ride home, we discovered that Megan has never seen  When Harry Met Sally , so we re-enacted the argument Harry and Sally have about Casablanca for her.  Julian, it turns out, does a quality "ride me big, Sheldon."  I've noticed recently that there's a big overlap between people who don't like arguments about politics and people who plan to vote for Bush in '04.  I didn't even realize how many Bush supporters I knew until recently, because they're all in the closet.  I find it very frustrating, because I  really  want to argue with pro-Bush people, both because I think it's important to try and change their minds, and because I want to understand why people like Bush.  A huge chunk of the country seems to think he's pretty great, and it baffles me.   I mean, if the whole TORTURE thing didn't change your mind, you must have a damn good reason for being on Bush's side.  So why can't we talk about this?  Why is it rude?  Why don't Bush supporters pipe up when people like me start ranting about how much we hate him?   If there was ever a question people should be arguing about, it's this one.  Sigh.  Right now I love: the expression on Ingrid Bergman's face when she realizes she's just walked into her ex-boyfriend's bar.

      From  urlLink a Wired article  on geeks who are developing dating technologies:  "IM is my medium," Burton [who's developed an app that digs for the IM address of people who are online at internet cafes] says with a laugh. "If I can get a girl to respond to my chat message, I'm golden." The trick, he confides, is to deploy certain "social hacks" in the instant message. "Like smiley-face optimization," he says. "You can say anything to a girl if you put a smiley face or a wink after it. I've said things like 'You should come over to my house and have sex with me. :) :) :)' and it's fine because they just think I'm joking. And then, more often than not, they'll come over and have sex with me!"  Social hacks?  Smiley-face optimization?  I need a shower.

      	 I love it when a song that you’ve heard a few times before and found unremarkable suddenly grabs you by the throat.  Case in point: “Under My Thumb,” which found its way onto my work playlist today.  Zow.  Why do I all of a sudden love this particular song?  I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.  On Friday I met up with my two best friends from elementary school for dinner. Resuscitating a friendship that’s been dormant for a decade is an odd experience.  I'm still a little baffled by how Allison & Heather can simultaneously be exactly like I remember them AND completely different.  I'm also quite pleased to say that they're both totally hot.

       urlLink   On Saturday Lindsay, Lauren, Joe, Jules, Kelly 1  and I all spent the day in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  We ignored the "Positively No Swimming or Wading" sign at the reservoir, noisily interrupted a local wedding, and finished the day at the Fredericksburg National Cemetery. 2   Every Memorial Day weekend, local Boy Scouts light one candle for each of the 15,300 soldiers buried there.  It was haunting and beautiful.  "Lee’s Headquarters," the memorabilia store next to the battlefield, was less poetic.  We were perusing the various Confederate pride items for sale (golf balls, shot glasses, etc.) when Joe noticed a sign behind the counter that said "Unattended children will be sold as slaves."  Classy!  I finally saw the last episode of Sex and the City last night.  The Carrie/Big reunion was aight, but what really got me was a scene where Charlotte and Miranda are sitting at a kitchen table talking about how Miranda has invited her sick mother-in-law to move in.  "You amaze me," Charlotte tells her, and without missing a beat, Miranda shoots back, " You  amaze  me ."  Man, I feel that.  The older I get, the more in awe of my friends I am.  The things I’ve seen them accomplish (and withstand) just bowl me over.  I don’t know if I’ve befriended a particularly strong, smart group of people, or if it’s that everyone’s strong and smart when you look closely.  Either way, color me happy.

      On Friday I had drinks with Megan and Pitt.  Pitt told us about this drink his step-grandfather invented called a "See Through."  It's equal parts chilled vodka and chilled gin.  It's called a See Through because after you drink it you're so messed up you start to think you can see through things.  According to Pitt, when made perfectly, a See Through tastes like water.  He lied.  (Except for the part when he said the drink really fucks you up.  That's definitely true.)  On Saturday Julian, Kelly, Tim and I saw They Might Be Giants play Live on Penn.  Ed wondered aloud once whether they're as clever as the Magnetic Fields.  I still don't think so, but they certainly rock much harder.  There was a kid about three rows ahead of us sitting on his dad's shoulders and playing air drums with a pair of empty water bottles.  The kid was a really talented air drummer, and the dad jumped up and down through the whole show.  Watching them, I suddenly felt inordinately optimistic about parenthood.  They Might Be Giants always remind me of the Cusicks, which got me thinking about music that makes me think of specific people.  "She Likes Me for Me" is my sister's, because she inserts her name into the lyrics as she sings along. ("She likes me for me, not because I look like Maggie Utgoff...") Megan gets "California," the OC theme song, because we sing along together really loudly (and badly) every week.  Paul Simon belongs to Steve, because he gave me a Best Of tape the summer after we first met.  "#41" is Riordan's, because he used it to break me of my snobby and irrational dislike of Dave Matthews.  "James K. Polk" is Ed's, for similar reasons.  Lindsay and Julian, by subjecting me to many, MANY renditions of "Nothing Better," have made it theirs.  Jason once claimed that "Take On Me" is the greatest pop song ever written, so that makes me think of him and his spectacular confidence in his own taste.  I can see the exact look Lauren had on her face when I came back from the bathroom at the Guster concert and they were playing "Happier."  I tend to forget things, so it's nice when music attaches itself to memories I don't want to lose.

The music was so quiet that it was really more a capella than karaoke, and the microphone was touch and go, so we had to yell to be heard.  Fortunately, Megan, Lauren, Neil and I were able to cope with the aid of large quantities of alcohol.  Megan even stood on a chair during her performance of Sweet Child o' Mine.  It was awesome.   urlLink Awesome to the max .  On Saturday I had dinner with the same bunch, plus Glee and Lindsay, at New Heights, a snazzy restaraunt in Woodley Park.  The food was delicious, and the conversation was divine.  Neil told a story that even Lindsay, the Wal-Mart of Stories, couldn't top.  My favorite part of the evening, though, was when we shared embarassing things that have made us cry.  Can you match the dinner guest to the thing that made them tear up?

      Have you ever read a book to someone you were in love with, or been read to by them?  I’ve seen it happen in several movies and television shows, and  urlLink the Magnetic Fields highly recommend it .  I never have, though, which surprises me, given the nerdy sort of love I tend to fall into.  Is it one of those romantic gestures that movies use as code for True Love but that never actually happen in real life?  I hope not.  I learned to love reading aloud when I was teaching, and I bet I'd like it even more if I weren't doing it in a room full of seventh graders.  Breaking News: Megan just emailed me to say that it has happened to her.  "Not [someone] I was dating. A suitor. It was a good move on his part. Ultimately unsuccessful, but by far the most successful thing he did in pursuit of me. And I made Alex read me a story once when I was sick, to make up for being jerky."  We’re totally adding this to our soon-to-be-published book,  How To Date Megan & Anna .

      I know, it's been a while.  I've been in a bit of a funk recently, but fortunately, I've got a team of experts working on it, so I should be back on the sunny side of the street in no time.  Lauren came over for pasta and red sauce and prescribed some vitamin B, Lindsay scoured the Internet for things to make me laugh, and Megan has been constantly at the ready with ice cream and Ewan McGregor movies.  Great friends, them.  Here's a brief recap of highlights from my blogging holiday:  1. Heather and I threw a bachelorette party for Allison.  It involved a lot of squealing about how if our 11-year-old selves knew what degenerates we'd be when we grew up, they would've been appalled.  (I think some of the pronouns in that sentence are wrong, but I have no idea which ones.)  I passed out on Heather's bed around three and then woke up at six convinced that I had to get home right away.  The hitch was, during the revelry, Allison and Heather both told stories about people in college screeching "Walk of shame!" at  students walking across campus early in the morning dressed in rumpled clubbing clothes.  I was, for some reason, convinced that this would happen to me as I walked home from Heather's place.  The solution I came up with was...wait for it...to go to Safeway and buy a can of Chef Boyardee, so that people would think I'd just gone out for some canned pasta.  I sort of wish I had a picture of myself trundling home as the dawn broke, dazed but determined, eyes caked in mascara, clutching a can of Beefaroni.  2. Hordes of my friends from various east coast cities descended on DC for the 4th.  My parents were nice enough to let us throw a rager at their place.  They also offered to buy us a handle of tequila when they found out I didn't have time to go to the liquor store.  Coolest. Parents.  EVER.  The party turned out to be pretty damn fun.  I can't go into too much detail without compromising several budding political careers, but I can tell you that the day involved large quantities of fireworks, light beer, and gambling.  A heady mix, that.  Check out the  urlLink carefully edited pics  Steve posted.  3. I went to Orlando on a business trip.  Orlando, as it turns out, is NOT the happiest place on earth.  My boss and I made our own fun, though.  We ate a LOT, and discussed politics, and snuck liquor and cigars onto a miniature golf course.  (That was actually his idea.  See why I like my job?)  I  kicked his ass, as long as you include tying one round and winning the other by one stroke in your definition of ass kicking, which I do.  Right now I love: polo shirts, cherries that cost $2 a pound, and summer movies.

      Last night, Megan and I went down to the waterfront for some gin-flavored roommate bonding.  We were discussing the All Men Are Dogs theory (to which an alarming number of my female friends subscribe) when this middle aged woman came over and sat next to us.  She started complaining to us about how rough it is to go out with your kids in tow.  Megan and I, taken aback that she'd brought children to a bar, asked where her kids were, and she pointed to a gaggle of spikey-haired twentysomethings.  She waved one of them over, forced him to sit down and talk to us, and walked away.    At this point we didn't know what the hell was going on, and, slightly flustered, we complimented him on having such a hot mom.  We then had a really strange 10 minute conversation about how his friends keep hitting on his mom and getting shot down.  Then his friends come over, and they're like, DUDE, that's not your MOM!  Sheepishly, FakeSon explained that the crazy lady was flotsam from the nearby bachelorette party who had, for no apparent reason, attached herself to them and started pimping them out to girls at the bar.  I'm not sure if that's more or less weird than going out drinking with your son and his friends.  Either way, whoa.  I think Megs and I would've gotten up and left at that point, but FakeSon's friends turned out to be incredibly entertaining.  The one Megan was talking to kept trying to explain how going out on Sunday night was a tradition for them.  "Lemme explain the tradition...see...here's how it works...if it smells good, FUCK IT!  If it tastes good, FUCK IT!  If it looks good, FUCK IT!  If it smells good, (long pause) FUCK IT!"    I, on the other hand, spent the evening trying to get an extremely tan, built, and hair-gelled dude to give me his bicep cuff.  It had a skull on it, and it said "Game on!"  His pick up technique was to walk up to girls, ask them to press the skull, and then say, "GAME ON!"  He refused to give it to me, even though I had several EXTREMELY GOOD reasons why he should.   The bicep cuff only cost $4, and I was offering him $5.  That's a 25% return on his investment!  That's better than bank accounts, the stock market and t-bonds!  He had a leather wrist cuff and a necklace with a shark tooth!  He didn't need a bicep cuff, too!  I work to stop terrorism.  The bicep cuff would've made me happy, and given me energy to work harder at my job.  Ergo, the terorrists win when he doesn't give me his bicep cuff!  If people asked him what happened to his "Game on!" skull bicep cuff, he couldv'e said that he gave it to a girl at a bar who was, like, totally begging for it.   Somehow he managed to resist my arguments. Idiot. I REALLY wanted that bicep cuff.  Right now I insist: that you all look at  urlLink this chart .  It appeared in the Times this weekend, and it's way better than  urlLink the other We-Hate-Dubya chart  that's been circulating in liberal blogs recently.

      Several nights ago I sat bolt upright in bed, gasping and trembling.  I lept up, turned around, and saw a huge spider descending on a thread towards my pillow.  It was silouhetted against the window, and I could see it bending and flexing its legs ominously, only inches above my bed.  I've been deathly afraid of spiders since I saw  Arachnaphobia  in third grade.  This freaked me out so badly that I had to spend the rest of the night on the couch.  I really, really want to know what woke me up.  Do I have spidey sense?  More importantly, is there some way I could use this spidey sense for fun and profit, without actually being in the proximity of any spiders?  Go buy a t-shirt at  urlLink politipunk.com .  They're hip enough for Natalie Portman, so they're hip enough for you.  Even if you're not in the market for a retro Kerry shirt, click on the "us" link and check out my friend Greta.  Yeah, I know.  She's talented, too.  Right now I love: not being attacked by spiders
