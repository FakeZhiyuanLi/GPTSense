      Don't know where it originated, but recieved it from my lil sister this morning.   Hello,  my name is Lewis and I suffer from the guilt of not forwarding 50 billion  fucking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you  send them on, a poor 6-year-old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her  forehead will be able to raise enough money to have it removed before her  redneck parents sell her to a traveling freak show. Do you honestly  believe that Bill Gates is going to give you, and everyone to whom you send  "his" email, $1000?   How stupid are we?   "Ooooh, looky here! If I  scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid by a model I just happen  to run into the next day!"   What a bunch of bullshit.   Maybe the  evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my house and sodomize me in my  sleep for not continuing a chain letter that was started by Peter in 5 AD and  brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower.  Fuck  'em.   If you're going to forward something, at least send me something  mildly amusing. I've seen all the "send this to 10 of your closest friends,  and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a  nickel from some omniscient being" forwards about 90 times.   I don't  fucking care.  Show a little intelligence and think about what you're  actually contributing to by sending out these forwards. Chances are, it's our  own unpopularity.  The point being? If you get some chain letter that's  threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life,  delete it. If it's funny, send it on.   Don't piss people off by  making them feel guilty about a leper in Botswana with no teeth who has been  tied to the ass of a dead elephant for 27 years and whose only salvation is  the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this email.   Now  forward this to everyone you know.   Have a nice  day.

      From This Modern World   As you read this, keep in mind that Bush can't win without Florida, and that elderly blacks in Florida are overwhelmingly Democratic:  Bob Herbert, in today's NYT, informs us that armed police officers have been showing up at the homes of elderly black voters in Orlando, many of them active in get-out-the-vote activities, and scaring the crap out of them.  The "investigation" (which officials refuse to discuss, or course) is explained by a lawyer representing the 73-year-old president of the Orlando League of Voters, one of the recipients of this fair-and-balanced treatment:   The fear generated by state police officers going into people's homes as part of an ongoing criminal investigation related to voting is threatening to undo much of the good work of the league. He said, "One woman asked me, 'Am I going to go to jail now because I voted by absentee ballot?' "  According to Mr. Egan, "People who have voted by absentee ballot for years are refusing to allow campaign workers to come to their homes. And volunteers who have participated for years in assisting people, particularly the elderly or handicapped, are scared and don't want to risk a criminal investigation."   Is there anything the Bush machine won't stoop to?   These people aren't just unfit for office; they're unfit for basic citizenship.

      Want to know why your prescription drugs cost so much? I'll tell you why, Ronald Reagan. -------------------------------------------------------------   Beginning in 1980, Congress enacted a series of laws designed to speed the translation of tax-supported basic research into useful new products &#8211; a process sometimes referred to as "technology transfer." The goal was also to improve the position of American-owned high-tech businesses in world markets. The most important of these laws is known as the Bayh-Dole Act, after its chief sponsors, Senator Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Senator Robert Dole (R-Kans.). Bayh-Dole enabled universities and small businesses to patent discoveries emanating from research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major distributor of tax dollars for medical research, and then to grant exclusive licenses to drug companies.    Yes, that's right drug companies are getting patents and exclusive licenses on discoveries paid for with our tax dollars. Where is my royalty check?    Until then, taxpayer-financed discoveries were in the public domain, available to any company that wanted to use them. But now universities, where most NIH-sponsored work is carried out, can patent and license their discoveries, and charge royalties. Similar legislation permitted the NIH itself to enter into deals with drug companies that would directly transfer NIH discoveries to industry.   Does this sound a little like "conflict of interest" to anyone else?    The most startling fact about 2002 is that the combined profits for the ten drug companies in the Fortune 500 ($35.9 billion) were more than the profits for all the other 490 businesses put together ($33.7 billion).   There is something wrong here, what the fuck were they thinking?

      After claiming he has no political affiliation with the GOP it turns out that O'Neill has made nearly $15,000 in contributions to federal races -- all Republican   Appearing on CNN's Crossfire on August 12, John O'Neill, co-founder of the anti-Kerry group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and co-author of the Regnery book Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry, denied he had links to the Republican Party: "I've had no serious involvement in politics of any kind in over 32 years."  But, as Media Matters for America noted on May 4, O'Neill has long-standing ties to the Republicans, having worked under the direction of the Nixon White House and clerked for Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist in 1990.   Moreover, since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, O'Neill has contributed $14,650 to federal candidates or national political organizations -- all Republicans:  2004: $2,000 to Duane Sand (ND)   1999: $1,000 to Peter Staub Wareing (TX)   1998: $250 to Rudy Izzard (TX)   1996: $1,000 to Brent Perry (TX)   1994: $2,500 to Texas Republican Congressional Committee  1993: $2,500 to Texas Republican Congressional Committee   1992: $1,000 to Texas Republican Congressional Committee  1992: $1,000 George H.W. Bush  1992: $1,000 to Clark Kent Ervin (TX)   1991: $1,000 to Clark Kent Ervin (TX)   1990: $400 to Hugh Dunham Shine (TX)   1990: $1,000 to A Tribute To Ronald Reagan

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One-third of President Bush's tax cuts have gone to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, shifting more burden to middle-income taxpayers, congressional analysts said on Friday.   The report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and calculations by congressional Democrats based on the CBO findings fueled the debate over the cuts between Bush and his Democratic challenger in November, Sen. John Kerry.   Using the CBO's figures, Democrats in Congress said the top 1 percent, with incomes averaging $1.2 million per year, will receive an average tax cut of $78,460 this year, and have seen their share of the total tax burden fall roughly 2 percentage points to 20.1 percent.   In contrast, the report showed that households in the middle 20 percent, with incomes averaging $57,000 per year, will receive an average cut of $1,090 while their share of the tax burden would move to 10.5 percent from 10.4 percent.   The CBO report said about two-thirds of the benefits from the cuts went to households in the top 20 percent, with an average income of $203,740.   People with earnings in the lowest 20 percent, which averaged $16,620, saw their effective tax rate fall to 5.2 percent from 6.7 percent, the CBO said. But Democrats said that meant their average tax cut was only $250.   Democrats said the CBO calculations, which they requested, confirm the view of independent tax analysts that the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 have heavily favored the wealthiest taxpayers.   What will he do for us next?

      I've had enough trying to keep my own blog going on my web server so we will give blogspot a try and see what happens. You can reach my blog here on blogspot at impissed.blogspot.com or at blog.timlewellyn.com they are one in the same.  I am pissed about a lot of things at the moment, mostly about political issues and the pending election, (if we have one). I am also pissed about religious issues that seem to be gaining popularity on the right and their impact on the rest of us.  So  feel free express your opinions and by all means rant if you feel the need.  Thanks  Tim
