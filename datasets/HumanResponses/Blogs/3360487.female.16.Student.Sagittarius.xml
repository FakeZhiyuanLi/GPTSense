      Yesterday was the Junior/Senior breakfast, Honors&Awards assembly, and Ring Ceremony.  All the junior and senior girls had to wear white dresses, and the guys had to wear suits with blue&green striped ties.  Everyone looked really good!  The breakfast was at this gorgeous country club by my school at 8:30.  We had breakfast and heard speeches from the class presidents, then we still had an hour before the assembly so Ellen and I went to Starbucks blasting old school *NSYNC and waving to random people in cars.  It's weird... the guys all wave back and smile but the girl we waved at gave us this really mean freaky look.  Girls are dumb.  I got a Strawberries & Cream frappuccino which was REALLY GOOD!  It tasted like a strawberry creamsaver in frappuccino form.  Then the assembly started, and of course the same like six people got all the awards.  Ellen had a program and wrote down guesses for who would get all the awards and she got 22 out of 31 right, its so predictable!  Right after the assembly was the Ring Ceremony, where the seniors give the juniors their class rings and sing them a song, and us officially becoming the senior class.  I of course didn't buy the ugly class ring (who pays like 200 dollars for that ugly shit? not me!) so Maria gave me an imaginary ring.  It's quite pretty if I say so myself.  Ellen, Ryan and I hung out for a while then I went home.  I realized I still have to clean out my locker but meh.  I'm too lazy.  I was going to go see Shrek early today with my dad but of course my mom said to take the 8 year old next door neighbor, who we have to wait for, and then the neighbor's mom wants to come too so we have to wait for HER until the end of the day.  Stupid people, you're ruining all my plans, I hate you.

      My English final went pretty well, and afterwards Ellen and I ate at Taco Bell.  We both got kids meals, wassup.  Afterwards I went to Gordman's and right as I was about to buy my stuff I realized I left my main credit card at home.  I was like "ok I'll just pay with my other credit card" when they said my credit card was DECLINED.  WHATTTT?  I put my stuff on hold and went home and called, apparently the stuff I wanted to buy was $1 over my limit and since it's a teen card I can't go over.  Bah.  I got my card, went back & got my stuff.  I got a super cute black bra purse, 3 adorable shirts, and I stole a white dress and some chandelier earrings from the mall across the street.  I was all dirty and sweaty and greasy and smelly so I took a shower and got ready for my mom's concert.  I put on a cute dress and some makeup and the concert was great.  Afterwards there was a reception for her and we got to eat shrimp and discuss piano with old farts.  Great fun.  Came home and that was about the end of my day. :)

      Yes, the final was easy.  I don't know why I got so hyped up about it, maybe because I've gotten used to AP exams and those are killer.  Anyway, the final was alright and afterwards Ellen and I went to Panera, and now I'm home and she's studying for her Physics final in a couple hours.  All I have left is German tonight (easy) and English tomorrow morning (easier).  Anybody want to invite me to gmail?  I will love you forever!!

      Went over to Ellen's house yesterday to study for history and we ended up goofing off until about 8 oclock when we actually started studying.  I've been up most of tonight trying to study for history.  It's so annoying when he says... I'll give you one of THESE 9 huge broad essay topics to write about.  You have to research EVERY topic and theres no time to actually study it!  Crap, I'm going to fail.  And I need an 84 to keep my A- in that class.  Please kill me!  Or just wish me luck because this final is going to kick my butt.

      Someone stole my picture on lj.  Hah, you know I actually find it amusing.  Why would anybody want to look like me?  Oh, and here's the best part:  they tagged the picture as "seductress." *rolls eyes* Yeah, whatever.  I had a dream last night that I got a 4 on every AP exam and I was happy about the compsci and the bio and calculus, but depressed because I thought I got a 5 on the english and that ruined it all for me.  God I hope I'm not that picky in real life.  I don't think I can wait until the scores come out in July.  Back to biology work, I suppose.  Anybody want to help me with how the juxtamedullary nephrons maintain an osmolarity gradient in the kidney and use that gradient to excrete a hyperosmotic urine?  Ew, vomit.

      Crap I have so much to do.  Well, I guess it's not much compared to what I HAD to do a couple weeks ago before AP exams.  But now I have to do about 5 AP biology assignments, study for my History and English finals, and makeup some AP compsci work.  We got a really cool robot vaccuum cleaner that looks like a UFO and just glides around the floor and cleans everything.  It's really neat and my dog is really afraid of it.  Hahahaha.  I really want a Gmail account.

      I've lost 2 pounds already and I hope to lose about 10 more.  I WILL weigh 120.  For breakfast today I had tvarog (like cottage cheese sorta) with some splenda sprinkled on top.  For lunch I had a sandwich, two slices of low carb bread (40 cals per piece) with tomatoes, a slice of turkey, a bit of mayo, some lettuce, and a slice of cheese.  I drank a can of vegetable juice for a snack.  Now for dinner I had one shishkabob (sp?), a few spoonfuls of sliced tomatoes, and about 10 sticks of fried asparagus.  Now I really really really want more of the low-carb chocolate I just had a bite of... it tastes so good!!!  Ugh.  I'm going running in a little while so maybe I'll burn some more off.  My dad took some pictures of me outside during dinner and I looked so fat!  I have these nasty chipmunk cheeks that I NEED to get rid of.  In good news, however, I ended up getting an A+ on my history final and an A on my english final.  The A+ brought my A- in that class up to an A so that was really cool.  My SAT II scores weren't so fortunate, however... I got 780 on Biology which is great, but 740 on Writing and 630 ON MATH?  I can definitely do better in Writing and I don't know what happened for me to bomb the math like that.  Current weight: 133.5 High weight:  135.5

      I've been really upset with my skin lately because it's been breaking out in small bumps and being red and blotchy and oily!&nbsp; I think I've finally figured out what the culprit is.&nbsp; It's this new foundation I've been wearing for about a week... the L'Oreal True Match crap has been wreaking havoc on my face.&nbsp; No more of that!&nbsp; Back to my Neutrogena stuff. &nbsp; I went tanning today and stupid me let her put me in a high intensity bed for 15 minutes.&nbsp; My face is as red as a tomato right now!&nbsp; If there's one thing I hate, it's having a sunburn.&nbsp; I almost got up the nerve to steal some new lotion on the rack by the entry desk while she was setting up my bed but chickened out at the last minute.&nbsp; I probably will next time. &nbsp; I called two hospitals today to start doing some volunteer work but get this... neither of them had any  room  for me.&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; Since when does a huge hospital not have room for free labor?&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; So I called nursing home (gag) and set up an appointment for tomorrow at 1:00 to discuss volunteering.&nbsp; I'm not really looking forward to volunteering there but hey... it looks good on my college app I guess.&nbsp; Plus its mostly just reading and playing games right?&nbsp; Yeah. &nbsp; Yesterday Ellen and I went to play mini golf with her brother.&nbsp; It was really hot though so we barely got through half of it.&nbsp; She took pictures of me throwing my golf stick and posing inside the little miniature houses though.&nbsp; That should be... interesting.&nbsp; Afterwards we went to Smoothie King and I got my Caribbean Way and then we just stood outside and blasted pop music from my car and danced by the road.&nbsp; Some people got a nice show... her brother also took a picture of me hugging the huge inflatable Smoothie King smoothie.&nbsp; Those are going to be some weird pictures. &nbsp; Lately the more I look at my eyes the more I want to fix them.&nbsp; The strabismus is getting irritatingly obvious and I feel cross-eyed whenever I look at myself in the mirror.&nbsp; I've officially decided that I'm going to get a job, and I'm going to save up my money until I can afford the surgery, and that's that.&nbsp; I don't care what my parents say, I want straight eyes.&nbsp; It's not right that I always want to cover up my eyes with sunglasses because I feel ugly otherwise.&nbsp; It's not right that I cried myself to sleep because I was so depressed over it.&nbsp; I KNOW this can be fixed and I'm determined to do it.

      I got my hair permed a couple days ago.&nbsp; I'm sort of nervous about washing it, since it's already gotten a bit straight and I'm afraid it will fall out even more.&nbsp; Stupid heavy, thick hair.&nbsp; So today I stole some Brilliant Brunette Shine Shock crap and maybe it will make my hair cool and shiny or whatever.&nbsp; Luckily tomorrow is my last day shadowing the ophthamologist... I'm getting so tired of sitting there for hours looking at the same pictures of the same eyes in the same book all day.&nbsp; Its good that I'm getting so many hours from this,&nbsp; because it's also pretty tiring.&nbsp; Anyway.  It's silly, but I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction.&nbsp; And its like romantic Harry/Hermione deals because Hermione reminds me of myself and Harry is just hot.&nbsp; Its all so sweet and I wish that I could just jump in and be in one of those stories for a day.&nbsp; I start reading them, and then I talk to Ellen online who has a hot date and I'm jealous of her.&nbsp; I want to go on hot dates... I want to dress up pretty and for guys to ask me out.&nbsp; Normal guys my age, not 30 year olds.&nbsp; I'm falling into that depressed mood again where I daydream.&nbsp; I just... need to snap out of it.&nbsp; And I need to go tanning.
