      Well finally my mother is back, its been two weeks since she went to Dallas and I had no one to make dinner for me to eat....  Well it feels like family all together again, I guess sometimes it is a great feeling...... hm... but then of course I love the freedom of being a lone sometimes too.  But anyways, lets talk about my day.  Its been a weird day, well not so weird for the part that I still continue to not love my job.  Its just seems weird to me that everyone is seems so nice to me, smiling, making jokes, laughing, was I paronoid or seriously did they hear something about me so they are treating me so nice????   I mean one moment I still remember that I was talking to my manager about people don't listen to me, I get no response for what I say next moment today people are asking for my help and actually paying attention to what I say?? that is so weird.  Honestly, there I have been talking in my head a lot and day dreaming a lot.  What's wrong with me? or is it there is something wrong with the world I live in!    One moment I feel that I need to totally upgrade myself because I feel I do not have enough skills to meet my own standards and next moment at work it seems like my bosses are expecting so much from me? and one moment they believe in me and next I feel like I don't know why I am here working at this company?  One moment I just feel like staying home next moment I'm worried that I need the money to survive.  My head is just spinning and spinning, emotionally I feel so dragged down but my brain keeps on working so hard to move on.... Maybe that is why I tend to tune out when I just get the chance to......  One moment I feel so hungry and want to eat everything I see next moment I see a message from my ex I don't feel like eating anymore... is it depression or am I just full?  Any moment I can just fall down and cry when I think of my ex but next moment I hate thee so much that I want to kill thee and I stop myself from crying and next moment I make myself to think of else much more important like my dogs and what I would like to do for my future and so on to stop.  I am having more and more headaches and feeling dizzy lately then before and also having noise bleeds more often, maybe I should go for a check up.  My brain just doesn't stop or is it my inner voice can't shut up?!  What if I die? sadly to say which I do not want, is it when someone has such illness that is the time when the most wanted you ever wanted will show up? just in time to say the last good bye?  If so I will die with tears since the one that may be the one I ever love the most will not once again have the chance to walk the roads of happiness.  What the hell am I talking about? I'm not going to die.... I"m still so young.  But then what are you going to do with your life if you don't die!?  Well I am not sure but for sure if I don't die there will be many choices to choose from....   I yet have to see the world! and be with the one I love! and share so much more happy memories that we both will encounter!  my dogs are so young there is so much more to live for, so many years... who will I be relieved to take care of them no one totally I can trust except myself! no I am okay, its just a minor thing.    I still have so much I want to do....... I can learn...... perhaps pet grooming, go back to school, baking, visit my sister in hong kong or perhaps go to some other country for travel and vacation!  Why? I am feeling so headache dizzy and tired...... why????? feels like my brain want to explode! spinning can't shut up......  That's funny to say....... and stupid......... I don't know what I want to say anymore........ just bla bla bla...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  Need to make this stop. STOP. stopped.

      Just got the conclusion why laying on my bed as I kind of awoken!  A few testaments: 1. A guy should not date a girl while when he is studying in school because: a. most guys do not have enough money to take care of the girl because: a1. he takes a loan for his own tuition a2. he worked at a full time job to save for his tuition a3. he works at a part time to pay for his tuition a4. worst of all but happens also a lot of the time, his family pays for his tuition!  2. Guys say girls are gold diggers when the girl needs money, the is actually justa BOY, Hence guys suck big time because guys should take care of girls because: a. Guys should take care of their own offspring since the girls are the one who go through the pain to give birth which furthermore girls are mother which many times children are closer to their mother, if you don't think so ask the judge why in many cases mothers have the right to claim for their children unless they cannot afford a better living for the child.  Guys should take care girls now because it is a practice to show the girl that the man that they are dating is most likely capable to take care of their children. If not, if the girl is wanting a child the girl should go on and find another potential male but however if a girl is comfortable which in this scenario the girl is the dominant and the male is just the girl then it is okay since they have an agreement but however the female is over riding the rule that males should take care of females and she has taken the choice to her own individual preference where many others have not and it does not mean that all other girls say 80% of the population have to follow her, if so, then many the human life source can easily be discontinued since many women are so much into their career they lack the time to bare children or for others they do not want children.   A guilt trip from guys: Guys say stuff like oh well why can't you (female) make money too! and we both share a house! half half..... well you see MALES! we females have to have to take the time to go work on ourselves since most females age older that you males so therefore if we worked we would age twice the time! due to the so much stress at work and pressue around and also not to mention the inner self which you guys say all the time "its okay, I will STILL love you if you get old, fat or ugly!" that is phenominal since if so, why is it so many guys while that time comes dumps their lady and finds a much younger female?! SO THEN, that is your dam answer! why we females can't share the house in MONEY WISE with you and furthermore if you try to pull this on us again, GO FUCK YOURSELF! or furthermore let's saying it this way, don't try to dump a MAN'S job on a female that already is stressed out with so much in her life! she got to keep fit, look great, do exercise perhaps some half an hour walking per day, as a bonus some cook for you since are saying "o poor honey, he's working so hard and he is such a darling to work for us to live in this... okay depends if ladies you find yourself saying living in this "stupid old house with water leaking and holes in it! and you are NOT in a 3rd world country, IT IS TIME TO RECONSIDER YOUR MAN NOW! if you still do not have children, if you have children you got 2 plans... one dump your children to your man which is very cold and selfish but some do... second plan, go out and find a living and forget about your looks everything for TEMPORARY! save enough money or better if you have friends and family can lend you money use that money on a tight budget to just use towards your kids to keep them alive and in good health, and make sure your look great, ladies it doesn't take a LV PURSE to look great! if you go blow that money you borrowed you might end up tracking another asshole, that is looking for a rich lady or something, this time around you need to look for a REAL MAN perhaps older and if luckily his wife has passed away and he is wanting to find a soulmate to spend the rest of his time with, either he owns some kind of restuarant or stable business that won't just close out anytime or either he has a well paid job and has SAVINGS and love kids, if you are still doing your job making yourself look great or either if you don't look that great you have a GREAT PERSONALITY meaning you got a good heart, give yourself the confidence and go look for YOUR MAN.  Men, DON'T THREAT YOUR GIRL that you will leave her, especially when she has kids, why? a. the kids will learn that you are such an asshole, and when that day comes old man you will get what you didn't expect! your own kids calling you an ass and disrespecting you all the way...... don't under estimate in years time what your kids can do to you... unless you are smart enough to be genuinely good to your kids and truly love them  b. your lady some day will awake and return you the unexpected, as you may or may not know, a built in feature with each lady is that she can bounce back some day and give you those words GENUINELY "you are such a loser"  c. your lady gave up a DAM LOT TO BE WITH YOU, she gave up her time to be with you, to keep herself looking good so that you dont' run off with another chick, with is ironic since that other chick that you barely knows in reality no matter what they say takes time to workout, look great same as the one beside you now.  Also she gave up her career, her dreams... yes she may say her dream is to be with you but then actually she meant only one of her dreams is to be with you but because she loves you she is giving up all hers those other 9 that may include: a. travel around the world  b. back packing c. be a movie star d. be a pop star e. be a manager f. be a general manager  okay the list goes on, yes guys you question how do some females have a family, and also work so much, guess what because you are kind of slacking off! to do YOUR JOB! but then it is not too late to feel guilty, okay if you find yourself saying "what the hell are you talking about?!" okay read this the beginning again, if you find yourself saying "that is so not true and saying fuck you!" then lets just say your inner self is protecting itself to face that truth you are impotent, you are useless!"  The standard to be a REAL MAN if you don't meet the standards consider yourself you are just a BOY! and that you do not have the requirements to truly date a lady! and consider yourself dam lucky that your lady is dating you! a. A real man provides the basic neccessities for himself, his lady which there only should be ONE and also his offspring which in today's time we call children. b. In emotional and physical, the lady is the man's everything, so hence anything happens the man would risk his life to protect her! so she is always most important over everything including if she has an emotinal breakdown. c. If the man has a great career and finds his lady in distress and needs his attention, he should reschedule his appointments and work around her and not his career to work around her. d. If c, is not quite possible, he must sit down and explain to his lady and make love to her to once ensure that she is secure due to lack of time he has spent with her for the past week. And work out something that can make his lady feel secure and happy again. tip: if you use computer you may consider using a web cam just to ensure your lady can see you and to feel secure and loved. The man should feel sure, why not!? this is so sweet that I can see her too! e. anything you make you should have a good plan where you going to spend it. If your LADY DECIDES that she wants a job any earnings she can either save it or either if she like spend it where ever she wants with her FREE WILL.  Any earnings that you make should perhaps go to the following, also by now that you are dating a lady you should make at least $2500+ if you own a car and $3000 and up if you still don't own that car and your still financing it, which this amount is just enough to survive on a normal family life which your target should be maker more for a better living, this amount is what you take home after tax deductions.    car monthly payment: $500  (for one car which the lady drives you to work and picks you up after work and you feel very happy about it since it is the most sweetest thing to see your lady before you work and first thing after your work, after sometime you may get your car after you have paid off your first in 2-4 yrs time)  rent or monthly premium for financing a home: $1000   savings for future: $200  (to pay off debts, future vacation)  emergency fund:$250   food:$500  which may include you going out for lunch or if your lady prefers makes your lunch or your lunch would be the dishes that wasn't finished up last night, if you go out for lunch you get $100/month that means you can not use more than about $5/day if you exceed, you must explain to your lady why as you will be taking out of the savings for future fund! yes the vacation to go to the carribean where the beaches are and that you both will have a great time, which your vacation pay is also contributed to be the spendings when you get there so don't justify you will be contributing more to the ticket part which is the savings for future.  Any tax return amount goes towards savings and emergency fund, and if you find yourself need to pay for tax return you may use the money in the savings to pay for your taxes. And perhaps decide either you go to a closer place that costs less during your 2 week or more vacation or save it up and go next year to mexico or the carribean, discuss with your lady. The lady for the financial health for both of you and also to make things work, you should be good enough to know better.  But however somehow if you guys get some extra money, from friends as a gift, which NO YOU CANNOT GAMBLE! and that most likely it won't happen then you can eat a big meal using that extra money, but then if you are a good gentlemen you would like to contribute it to savings fund to make sure if anything wrong happens your lady will not have to worry. Also if you get laid off there would be money for both of you to survive on and that your lady will not be forced to find a job, force meaning  you have to ask her and not on her free will which she has the right not to because she doesn't have the time to! But then if you find that financially you seem to be too tight, it is time that you try to get a raise or promotion or find another company that pays you more. If you do make more than things may change, you may be able to eat out everyday if you really want to and purchase that nice car figurine that costs like $250 bucks regarding not every month! but then that also means you have to save up more money to purchase gifts for your lady such as that LV wallet that you totally know she wanted for so long or that diamond ring that could remind her of your engagement that you know for sure she would be so happy.   money for your lady:$500  (she needs to buy her lady things such as facials, make up, clothes, lingerie etc. bet you will like the lingerie part later, so just pay her! and don't ask so much!)   And finally, if you are a REAL MAN what you read above all the way you say "of course too all of them!" and if you are just a BOY what you read above totally is nonsense to you.  Good for the guys who agree to the above, you are doing a great job! "yes, you are the man ^_^! Boys, either go kill yourself or start to grow up, you are such a shame to both men and women!   Words to the real man: "keep up the great job, you know that already, "if there is a will, there is a way and that your girl doesn't need to worry about a thing when your with her! and you always see her smiling! and you smiling too!"

      Dear Bylie,  Just before I head out to work, I just wanted some of your advice or more opinion what do you think?  I was just chatting on icq, where my ex said something really mean to me which I totally think it hurts eventhough I denied it, but then what thee said was so mean for a fact I know exs ok evil ones like thee say stuff to just hurt you because they are still hurt?  Anyways the main topic started when I told him something like I can marry anyone here in canada which is so cool. And then X said that I wast FAT and got to keep fit in order to marry someone because no one wants to marry a fat person?! OMG, that is so not true, look at the world out there! there is so many fat people getting married each day! which they get married is what I call love.  Perhaps yes, I have a plan to lose weight, but it should be for myself not just to get married to a shallow person that don't know what the true meaning of love.  If hence, that one marrys another for looks, it won't last, because does it mean that once they get fat or ugly that one will have an divorce or at least not love thee?  What a true marriage should be that two people are willing to sacrifice their life for eachother and that the love is not based on appearance.  True love is much more deeper and hence romantic with much meaning!  If hence one just wants a good looking gal, why don't they just go get a hooker!? I mean I seen those chicks, some are pretty dam hot and good looking!  But what is it in the inside?  It won't work because the inside first their career is sleeping with other people which is dangerous because a lot of sex diseases spread around and secondly what are you going to tell you friends? Yes they may accept but hence worry about your health.  Furthermore, may I confess, true X brought up the idea that fat is unhealthy, but then I believe one fact being fat is not the biggest problem, being unhappy and living is.  I mean many people are happy and fat out there! I see it at different places.  Yes okay maybe I will be skinny again but then I remember I had the problem that too many people were after me and still I didn't find a good one that I find truly love me and I loved thee.  Fat yes is unhealthy...... but okay I maybe really just can't take it out of thy mouth to say such a thing.  Just because the past two years I was still into the hole thinking I would not break my promise and wait for thee eventhough thy has a new girlfriend already.  Well I guess it isn't a big factor afterall since you got your plans going neway before speaking to thee.  You had plans to go back to school to finish your diploma as well as lose weight with your friend LTC! She's got her own problems and you got yours, the other day it was so happy to know that there is someone in the same boat with you in love and in life that both of you can support eachother.  You both had plans getting married soon.  I mean it ain't just you, there are a lot of people out there like you, and most of all your little tiny problem isn't the biggest problem of life and death right now.  As X said it, it is unhealthy but in the way thy said it was to hurt you.... and also think of it this way, thy is not good looking nor handsome furthermore no guy well not say no guy but perhaps say a guy had to choose you over thee who would the guy choose? duh! don't even have to think about it, of course you! You are much more prettier, smart and also understanding, you have much more to give such as you treat love as something precious not something that can be replaced by moments of jewlery trend!   Don't worry about it... I mean soon you will get married before you know it, perhaps at least meet the right person in the next year or not even! Or perhaps you don't want to get married, but for what you do, remember nothing and including NO ONE is worth your feelings of unhappiness nor pain, just live life as you want it to be and do each thing to make yourself happy until one day you meet the one that is willing to sacrifice his own life for you and you feel the same too.... ^_^ smile...   And one two last thoughts, I have finally found why i felt more comfortable with my XX than with my X is because the first one looked beyond looks, thy searched for inside, the second one searched for just the outside, which sadly to say thy search for what thy doesn't have or hence not true for first then at least no wonder X2 mother has to always keep fit in order just to keep her husband! that is just so sad........   I could of been more mean just to say, well you got to go for a surgery in order to get married then! but forget it, its meaningless and just a waste of time arguing with such a unmature person I seek someone that i feel that can provide me warmth, feeling that he is very knowledgable and mature.....

      I'm back, I know I got to work in a few hours or so but then I'm just lonely I guess..  It feels better when you let your feelings out when normally you feel it is unsafe to let others know, you are afraid of what they would say and think of you.  But anyways, here it is.  Tonight didn't do anything special just want out for a drink with some people/friends.  I mean deep in mean as a secret I sometimes feel that aren't really my true friends as some others. Its kind of hard to trust people than yourself these days because the next moment you tell them your true feelings of something then everyone else knows and starts rumors.  It is so sad how people entertain themselves based on rumors of people.  If life was more simple, it'd be much better I guess... If everyone was truly caring and know that it is not the right thing to say and think of another.... its kind of hard to explain or I'm just kind of getting brain dead since it is getting late.  Seriously its soon going to be 2 years since my last break up and I guess at the beginning I was really depressed but then I got to say or "I'm not sure" if that my cut is totally healed already and that its just the feeling of lonliness now that I got no one caring and loving me and sharing loving warm moments that is why I think of my ex and still feel or believe that I am hurt.  Is it that I believe that I am hurt or am I still hurting? Its kind of ironic, I mean if the brain allows it self believe it is hurt the heart may be convinced it still is.  I mean will power is pretty important here. If you stop yourself and think positive thoughts I think it'd might be better than telling yes I still care about my ex etc and feel hurt?  I mean what is it? I know my ex has a gf and well I'm kind of okay with it? 2 thoughts, a. is that it is never too late to find your ex when you have the money and will to since life is so long, as long as they are not dead you still got a chance b. love is like a game, if you know what to do and say and plan it you can reach your target.  But then on some cases I known in the past it just don't work because there is something wrong with the personality of a person and that the person is butt ugly.  I mean to love someone or more likely to be loved you got to have something that the other person sees in you. Well, not neccessarily just appearance but at least your personality itself. c. of course its a bonus if you are very good looking but then if a good looking piece of art is hollow and nothing to give inside there is no point is there? the answer to confirm is "no".  I mean lets rewind and talk about my ex, what does my ex have that should make me still love thee?  Well lets say during times when we were together that we had some money we were happy but when we ran out I don't remember it was that great either.  But somehow I remember thee emotionally used words to abuse me very much and black mailed me for money.  That's great....... ok being sarcastic here.  Besides that thy is not the best looking, I mean its been a while, I don't exactly remember how thee looks like but at some point I remember myself having a thought actually thee is not pretty but kind of ugly too.  So based on previous discussion one must have something inside or outside or both so that it is worth loving thee? Well I thought love can not be calculated? yes and no, I mean you can love a killer if you didn't calculate these things or a crazy person that will momentarily want to kill you or a rapist if you didn't calculate these things. I mean for love you got to draw a line..  Look at yourself, you are a kind hearted person so you would probably be better off with someone kind hearted and not someone just kills people for no reason. Yes you may want to help one but then it will be hard and you may not have a good relationship if you were to be with such person.  I mean to love you got to be able to give up your life and dignity for the other and also in return the person at the sametime at free will totally feels the same and wants to offer his life and drop his dignity for you.  That is true love. If not that there is no true love but just one slave and one selfish prick.  Which the relationship in other words is not worth! there is no relationship.  In your case, your ex just wanted you scam you for money, I mean yes you cheated on thee but then thee also cheated on you at the end.  yes you did try to scam thee for money but then thee did too. I mean to be nice you can say you both are even.  But then think of this, if one did love you so much, he would not calculate for you what did you him.  I mean love is about accepting and forgiving not resenting and pay back.  So obviously thee is not the right person for you.  You may say yes there was so much happiness, but then think of this, anyone that has money and makes you laugh can give you the same feeling... you did experience it with someone at that point, but then of course dropped the either for two reasons, one that person cannot be a person to live forever because one cannot even survive on its own and second thee seeks for one that can be dependent on and not one that is independent and wanting to take care of you.  So your ex was the same, yes thy may seem to have changed since he is able to find a job and possibly he may stick to the job but then deep down thee is not a person that wants to take care of another because in the fact when you scammed him money he resented you and totally scammed and black mail you back for just money.  If one loves another it is not about money it is just forgiving and would not perform such an act.  So there for now I think you are waking up and at least getting a bit of the answer.  You think you stil love thee because you are in a dream or more like a fantasy that it'd be working out if you got back together but the fact is thee is not good enough for you that he is such a person that will black mail and scam you for money! and then next cheat on you.  You want a person that is willing for you scam thee and that even asks you to scam thee but will continue to love you not because what you did to thee but then he loves you for who you are and accepts and forgives, and perhaps leads you into the light and not gives you back what you did and have nothing learned but just leaving you resentment and pain.  Its okay to go through these things in life since you grow up and develop your own thinking and perhaps learn how to forgive and forget.  Besides this, for now what is totally worth is not wasting your time on something or someone that is not by your side and that making you being so negative and side tracking your own life.  For your own sake you should do something for yourself.  Such as going to school and upgrading yourself or at least learn and do things that can guarantee your own survival.  Its okay, even you tell me you do want to get back with your ex now, its okay.  But you know before you even do so you need to improve yourself first.  And I know that if you just improve yourself besides thee there will be A LOT of people after you, so you will be the one choosing not thee.   You know that it can happen but then the question is that do you really want to? is this the one that you want to be with the rest of your life? what kind of life will you guys have? is this the life that you truly want? is it enough for you? or you want a better life and perhaps when you get to choose you may want to choose another path another person? You may be not sure now, but its okay, now can just tune out on these thoughts, since you are still young, at least a got a few more years to think and decide on the path you really want to take and not regret.  But then now just relax and do something you really want to for yourself, something you feel will make yourself being satisfied as well as happy.   Remember, you got to have a satisfying relationship with yourself and be able to be happy on your own before you are ready to have another relationship with another. Having a good relationship with another requires having a good satisfying relationship with yourself first. By having a good relationship with yourself is, you have to succeed all the demands your inner self wants, such as lose weight or if not go to school or have some times out to relax etc.  Anyways, you are running out of time, you need to go to sleep because you got work tommorrow and you need to work because you want the burden of the debts to dissapear soon. You need the job to make money so you, yourself can feel lighter and less worried.  So for now, good night, and tune out of these trouble things and just concentrate and focus on the things you should be thinking of now which is yourself not just love and relationships.   ^_^

      Dam just wrote an essay and lost it, that always happends to me!  Okay well it may be mean that I should just sum up what I say in a few shorter sentences.  Okay, this is more targeted to men to read and tips to date a lady.  1. a man should make minimal $3000/month 2. ladies do not require to work the man pays for her living  3. ladies should take their time to keep themself beautiful, such as daily 1/2 an hour walks 4. ladies cook at home, buy groceries 5. if there is one car, it is given to the lady providing she will drop off and pick up her man to/from work 6. any left overs from dinner will be the man's lunch the next day  7. The  financial plan for their life together  should be as follows: a. $1000 monthly rent/ financing  for their home including utilities b. $500-food includes $100 allowance for the man per month for lunch which is if he has nothing to eat of left overs from last night and incase he needs to take the boss out for lunch to impress him and get a potential raise or promotion, where it should be some place that the lady knows the owner and staff and that the man provides her with a reciept just to keep track what money was spent on where this month and be on budget c. $500 lady's allowance to buy whatever female things to keep her beautiful and other times sexy (eh-um lingerie costs a lot! over $150 bucks, and includes that you NEED boxers, socks, that don't cost more than $100 to buy stuff for you,just pay her!) d. $250 monthly savings for paying off tax returns, debts, vacation, investments, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, GIC's down payment for an apartment to rent out to other people to make more money, to open a business to make more money etc.  e. $250 emergency fund: the dog needs surgery, the needs to be fixed, the pipes are leaking in the house you are not totally not able to fix it f. $350 monthly car financing g. $150 gas and engine oil etc. for car  Hence another financial plan is that you own the car already and that you make only $2000, which the lady temporary gets a part time job until in a year or two you will get a raise to make at least $2500 so that she no longer needs to work.  So she would minmal make $500/month and on a minimal pay job work no more than 18.75 hours per week meaning 2.5 almost 3 days of her week she works.  Hence those days she is not expected to cook but instead you both go eat out at a economical restuarant which is taken out of the $500 which $100 was for your back up in case you needed to spend it, if you don't spend it last month that money would be used for the time now that you are eating out, if you spent it your allowance for dinner for both is no more than 13.33 including tips, so look at those coupon deals! eat for 7.99 with coupon, buy a drink and a burger and get another burger free. But then okay fast food kind of sucks, ask your lady if she is okay with it if not perhaps you can cook for a change that be very sweet, yes you work but then normally your lady should not work so you are making up for you need her to work, so its not that bad after all for you to cook.   later in a year or so, you should also start saving RESP for your future children with is in a year or so.  The plan should be u have a steady okay paying job that makes a minimal $2000 take home/month and that you dont' have any debts. Meet your lady, she is working at full time or part time job or perhaps in part time school and has a part time job. You and her after minimal 3 months decide to move in together, you pay for the rent and everything mentioned above, she has a part time job to pay for her female things. By the time you guys are together and lived together for another year or no more than 2 years, you both get married and that you assume everything financially and emotionally is going well. By the time you both have been together for 4 years, you should have your first kid and then by the time your kid is 4, you should have your 2nd kid. Which first kid should be a boy and second kid should be a girl, since boys take care of girls the brother will take care of the sister.  During this time you are continuing saving in RESP about $500 per month, by the time your kid is 18 and ready to go to college or university, you should have saved up more or less $9,000 and additonal contributions from the government and any interest rates on top of what you saved all these years. The second child at that time should be 14, in grade 8/9, and still in high school.  By the time that your first child graduates she will be 21 and he will pay for his sister's tuition by making at least $2000/month and spending no more than $500 per month for the next 3 years, when he is 26 he should meet a girl and continue what his parents did and start a family soon. During he is 24-26 he has saved enough money to buy his own car and down payment to rent an apartment to live with a girl. Then when his sister graduates she will work part time or full time and spends the next 5 years trying to meet a good guy that could provide her a good living and good emotional relationship that her mom and dad has.   By the time that the first child has graduate, the normal monthly savings $500 should go towards RRSP or investments that are part of the monthly savings.  By this time the parents should be around the age 51, and then the next ten years or couple will save as much as they can and hopefully reture at age 60 and the kids will be age 30/34 starting off their own family and any extra money they make will give to their parents to go on a vacation, which the male male be expected to die around age 70 and the female around age 80 which during this time the male would have life insurance all these years provided by his work place or himself if he owns a business and that those 10 years the female would have more than enough to live on and any extra money when she dies will be passed on to the son and daughter to help out their family living. Where also at this time the mother has the choice to live with the daughter, the son or go to a elderly home to spend time with others.   A note to the tomboys (TB) out there, if you are a lesbian, you are expected to take the over the role of the man, if you don't expect kids, you may use that fund to go to vacations to spend it with your honey or further more get a better living.

      WOW! Mac Donald's is revolving its long century of culture food! just to compete in the market!  Coming up with weird ideas like slice apples with caramel dip and a whole new menu that trys to be all health conscious, its killing itself in a way agreeing to the media.  After wendy's launching its sald menu fast food restuarants have been changing a lot in the past year or so. (now year 2004)  I mean if Mac Donald's the top leader of fast food is changing think of it what can't happen in this whole world!? anything can happen!  I mean from child hood the first fast food or actually known place to eat was "Mac Donald's" parties go to Mac Donald's, Halloween function perhaps Mac Donald's even in elementary school we had Mac Donald's Day! We would order cheese burgers or ham burgers and if I didn't remember wrong, it would come with a huge yellow and red container for orange juice!  Wow Mac D's what a surprise after over I would say 25 years they are changing their menu! to be healthier?? that is kind of a wow! surprise!!!  But what will the future be like for Mac D's? I mean if it had to compete for healthier why don't they just became a salad bar!   seriously a secret or perhaps not, but I seriously think someone should open a fresh fruit salad bar with just chilled fresh fruits and salads and perhaps nice every day soups which are very low in fat! which this way it is a concept for the want to be fit people not to worry to over eat!  I mean it would be such a blast to have a place that had all you can eat fresh fruits and salads which fresh fruits include exotic fruits around the world like mangos, papayas to dragon fruit and the list goes on which it is always fresh, chilled and peeled for salads have cooked greens to salads with dressing and for soups have meatless chicken broth to vegetable soup like russian la bortsche to clam chower that actually comes in 1 litre proportions.  I mean the idea would be for take out soup in a convenient litre that someone can have for a meal and not worry to get fat and actually it is healthy replacing the fast foods that we usually just grab because we are in a hurry and starving!  Too bad I have so broke, if I had the money I'll totally do this! I mean even thought of a name for it "fruits & veggies" so original but then so true.  perhaps the coming generation of fast food restuarants will make my dream come true.

      After that day visiting the temple and asking about my love path, I keep on thinking about my this guy at work!!!OMG!!!!!!!!!!!! I MUST BE GOING TOTALLY CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  &nbsp; This is was weird I mean I remember I totally thought he was a loserrrrr because he gives me the feeling he is flirts with girls all the time and the worst is that he should be married and has a wife, I mean I don't know how good their relationship is but then I thought he was a jerk. &nbsp; First he doesn't seem all so smart and now I really don't know. I must be going crazy, I get all nervous when he is around, I play it very cool but deep inside or outside I'm starting to sweat. I'm starting to actually care about how I look to him! THIS IS CRAZY!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp; I mean it just must be that answer making me trigger like this, I mean yes at first I had good thoughts about him, I mean I always wanted a guy that is older, smarter, knows many languages meaning what I know he should know and what I don't know he should know to teach me too which is a part of being smart and it makes me feel kind of I don't know its kind of sexy when a guy knows so much and he is there to protect you and do the things you are unable to do. &nbsp; I need some older smart guy soon............ I need a man in my life that can make my life more meaningful than just going to work and then don't know and have much to do after work besides be around my dogs and then stay home on this computer and not accomplish much just browsing the web and time kind of passes by........... &nbsp; Yesterday, I went to Home Depot since I really wanted my own grooming table really bad to groom my dogs and then well couldn't find a good place to buy it locally and a good price well besides it something to and kind of fun to make something from scratch and be able to be proud of yourself for years to come that you made it, anyways well all this materials I bought was kind of heavy, I can't believe it I spent the WHOLE day at home depot from I think I left my house around 1ish or 2ishpm and then I went there and then was coming back around 7ish and then decided to go back! I didn't leave that place until 9ish! sometimes time seems to just vanish and sometimes it seems like an hour is just like a daayyyyy longgggggggggg!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp; omg, I have so bored.&nbsp; I don't know how much longer can I hang, I seem so tuff outside but then does anyone even know or where is my prince that would understand me more than everyone else and that actually can read me and know me????? I'm going crazy, I day dream too much, I'm starting to dream to see this guy and then when we talk and our eyes connect I want to believe he knows what I'm feeling deep inside, this is crazy I never have been like this.  &nbsp; A crush on a married man? A crush a guy? A crush on someone that I looked down upon? &nbsp; I'm so confused........ &nbsp; I feel so lost sometimes I mean like yes I got this job but at the end of the day or during the day I feel like a zombie. &nbsp; I wake up and feel grouchy and then go to work I strive for a smoke to just help relieve the stress from the thought of going to work, at work I face these people that seem to be jealous and hardly truly respect me and then I can't say anything much because for my job I don't even have the appropriate title, not a supervisor, not a stocker, not a cashier, yes work in admin and basically everyone from the top boss to the bottom stocker. &nbsp; Top boss to look after the office bottom stocker to order the toilet paper and drinking water when there is none and my manager to assist and remind him in the things he ALWAYS forgets. &nbsp; I mean yes from the outside looking in it is a good job, I'm not even sure where to go at this moment unless they release me but then what happens if they don't release me? It kind of scares me that I'm goign to be one of those old ladies working at the same position and office in this cubicle for the next few years or worst 10-25 years. Omg.......... those fat ladies that are pretty old fashion by the time they have worked for the company and young people come in and know you as the OLD NO LIFE lady that has no where to go and is considered an ANTIQUE!!!!!! in the store!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.................. &nbsp; I NEED a more exciting life!!!!!!!!!! I need that fire... I need that warmth............................ but when????????? who???????? where??????? lost, help, human intimcy from the one that I can feel he understands me with eye contact..... and we can even speak and understand eachother without saying a word........ where and when will this person show up?? &nbsp; I need more meaning in my life very soon............ &nbsp; okay if anyone does read this, I don't need your comment on how I am having a crush on this married man okay! I know already this is so crazy......... for my feeling on this particular person.&nbsp; Well maybe it'd be temporary as it seems like I like him and next moment I don't and now I kind of do and I"m not sure... o well....

      The one is who understands without a sound, owns worlds but will not show, forgives and forgets without brag, capable to change results as I wish, would not question my choice but only supports for my decision, and lastly protects me with all his soul because he truly loves just me...
