      Well this weekend was going great until Saturday. We went to Bush Gardens. Raining and all I didn't expect to see them there. I thought hey I'll be a good Samaritan and offer them a ride to their destination. I've known em for a while so its not like their strangers. Usually he is with them, but I didn't pay it no mind. Too Oblivious. As we drove out we had a good conversation about our futures. Sexy rabbit is in the car not saying anything guess too shy. You would think people would let u pass to go into Wendy's but no! I waited there for about 10 minutes. In the meantime, I got a few good laughs. Drop em off and pull up into the left lane that's turnin into Bush Gardens. Unexpectedly, I see him. I had to look a couple times to make sure it was him. He was with someone. Now I'm really not the nosy type of person, but my 007 instinct was slowly pulling in. I remember reading the year book. It must of been her. Nicole. So this is the mysterious girl. Why didn't he tell me? Cooter, how would I know.lol. I always tell him whats up with me. I tell him I'm coo right now just talkin to Jmillz (as he calls him). Really I wasn't mad just disappointed.  Damn what is this?  I just couldn't understand. I'm pretti easy-going. I don't know. Called him up the next day wonderin if he wanted these VIP tickets I got for this club. But I didn't have the heart to ask.  How long does it take then?  Nyways besides that I had a great time at Bush Gardens, didn't get to dark. Yeah!!! lol. Went to church and had a great time with Mrs. Peggy. That crazy lady.  Yesterday actually I started my working out. like round 10 at night. I was like man I have got to get some stress out. Was there fo bout 1 n 1/2. Did my 2 mi. I felt good this mernin.lol. I do feel good. I think I'll be prayin more often in the mornings. It just makes the day start off so good.  Well called him lata found out the truth. Kinda? Nyways he's straight I guess. Gummie just signed out said he'd be bk. I wonder what happened to the broccoli?

      Ya long night, woke up then just went back to sleep. As a I hear "Jesus Walks" I begin to slowly wake up. As I'm peckin on my cell to my son, I start to gain consciousness. Lata as I begin to clean, I realize that this pre-med thing I'm gettin into is going to be real hard. I'm ready tho. But am I really? I look at some doctors and just see that they have no life besides their job. There is mo out there for me. Am I just doing this for someone else or me? Been my dream or have I just been brainwashed into wanting it to be my dream? Only God knows what I will do with my life. I began to pray last night to Him and asked and meditated. There is time but not enough. I will start to realize what I want in life. Well I'm off to my Chem book now.

      Waking up in the morning I hear someone call me. "Sony, wake up!!" As I grind my teeth I begin to hug my pillow cuz I have to say goodbye. Slowly I walk through the cool marble hallway. Eyes not completely open I accidently bump the wall as I walk. Pops greets me with a kiss, yet I don't want to talk. Talkin is not my thing in the morning. I open the fridge and look wondering if I'm really hungry. I close the door and realize I need to go and sleep some more. As I walk back to my room I see the book I was reading last night,  "Maximize the Moment" by T.D. Jakes. I begin to turn the pages trying to find something that made me really think last night...I remember that I underlined it...Finally I found it."We are conceived in a blaze of passion and we enter this world in a flash of urgency, our life igniting quickly, eupting in flames of glory. We combustion in various levels of splendor and the, in the blink of an eye, we burn out." I guess the point of that is just to explain that while life seems so short, I really need to make something out of the erupting flames. Well I'm out got's to go clean. Plez! LOL

      Aftea gettin dressed and ready to go to the awards, I tell pops that I'm leavin. Maybe it was a lil too short. But I thought it was cute. M lil black skirt and a yellow ribbon was not makin my pops happy. "Where the hell are you going like that?!" IN astonishment I began to argue. He always does this to me right when I'm about to leave and almost late. As I walk through the kitchen Aunty is like tellin me to rush. My sis was tellin me to just put the skirt in my purse and wear it when we get outta the house. My lil 007 sis. LOL. But I didn't instead brought out my good dry-cleaned clothes out. Turnout it did look betta than the skirt. Well we rush to Dade City campus. Why can't they just have the award in Brooksville. I try to take a couple short cuts. The short cuts I thought would make the trip long actually were so long. I'll just stick to the old route. I get there finally at 7:03. I didn't kno exactly where at the campus this awards was being held. So I tell my sis to just look for the black people. LOL. Well we got there and Mr. Imani greeted us at the door. The place was packed. I couldn't find my team. There I see Mrs. Kay. Tiki calls me but I only see one seat. Poor Sexy Raabit had to sit by herself. I felt bad but I knew she wouldn't sit by the two guys next to me. man Phat was there. Girl your crazy. No lie. We were crackin jokes tha whole time of the awards. Man then outta nowhere Mr. Imani calls up the Brain Bowl team. We aren't really involved with CROP so nobody really knew who we were. He begin to explain that all of us achieved high grades blah blah. Then he comes to me. Oh boy. Just ramblin about my history. Nobody needs to know.LOL. Anyways I was so hungry, I thought that we'd get at least some cold pizza something. No cookies/chips. Man crazy. Chad its okay, you just need to take out the braids. "I wasn't in a club." Sure hun. LOL. Well we start to head home and man there is a gas station. Raabit is hungry so I'm like ok we'll pull in here. As she's gettin her crackers, a huge black guy with a cowboy hat comes in the gas station. And picks up this lil white redneck. WOW I have neva seen a black redneck in my entire life! He was missin a tooth, takin all country not black country but red-neck country. N he had a huge truck on the high tires. When he came into the gas station. Raabit thought he was about to rob it. She looked so scared.LOL. We began to walk out. "You crazy, you aint riding with me", as I got in the car and he tried to holla at us.LOL. Ah but we got home. Raabit is crazy! I love my Raabit.LOL. Nyways got home and had some dinner. I had Raabit repack my bags, cuz I wasn't feelin good. but Raabit did good. Well I'm out I gotta finish up packin.

But I just wanted to prevent certain things from happin, you kno be cautious. Now the hurrican comin Friday. I started preparing Thursday. Tieing the trampoline, lawn furniture, and yes even the garbage around trees. Pretti crazy. My fam thought I was. I even was takin pics for insurance purposes. Whoa (laughing)! Though calm and collected my boo gave me a lil scare. Really D, you did. Your stories bout Andrew kinda freaked me out. My family was really taking it pretti easy. My aunt started cleaning. Even made me start cleanin too. Then afta hearin the news that it hit down south I was like okay we aight. I couldn't watch the Olympics though cuz of all the weather info and ish.

      Well the weekend went aight. Just confused I guess. You go to orientation expecting to come out there cleared with your questions you had before you got in there. Then its done and you find yourself with more questions and confusion. Nyways I guess the only way to cure it is to go shopping. Then its one of those days when you look in your wallet and you find like a few dollars and  wrinkled reciepts. Even more depressin. Sucks to have no money. You find something good but can't get it. Copped out Anchorman. Stupid funny!!:-) Being influence by the Indian culture I've found myself wanting more and more to get my nose pierced. Ya kno a lil dimond nothing big. Just keep it sexy. Shoot even my grandmother got one. so I think thas what I'll do for the big 18.OK. I was very happy to be my unexpected happy  birthday call. its aight only a couple more weeks n then I'm legal.LOL. My sis is not even tryin to help the situation: the negativity is very ill. "I don't think you'll be allowed to do anything even when you turn 18"-words of beast. We'll see. Hearin the vibration of my phone I find 2 urgent msgs. Wondering if everything is okay-heart beatin kinda fast. Oh then you find a very soothing voice on the otha side. Heart begins calm. I'm lovin the urgent voicemails. Sometimes the things you do for your fam is just crazy. I feel like a soccer mom. LOL. I went to church yesterday and the sermon kinda hit home: do things for others only to honor God. I find myself helping people and when they thank me, I'm like "It's okay, don't worry about it." I didn't realize that doing that is just honoring myself not the Almighty. But reall what am I supposed to say?  "In the name of Jesus I did it!!"lol I don't know. I'll find a way.  R.I.P Rick James.

      Wow I'm finally awake. D, I don't know how you sleep on those few hours. Its a killer. Afta my long night. Walking arround sufferin from insomnia I found myself in pitch black cuz of the storm. Used the cell phone light as my flashlight. Improvisin or being ghetto, huh? The sun's out already. Aight I guess I'll go to sleep now. Man you'd think that peeps would leave you alone. nope afta an hour and a half of seein the back of my eyelids. I hear , "Wake up, Sonia. Take aunti to work." I am not the mornin person, so in most cases I began to cover myself in the sheets. Mad cops on the road. Ahh but I'm too slick fo them. I guess I'm always on the look out fo them. Got home and feel back to sleep. Then I hear, "You need to clean your closet, wake up!" In my mind I'm just wondering if they will eva leave me alone. Where has the respect of sleep gone. Bryd I got something fo you, my record on Tetris will be unbeatable. Shoot I'm a competitor too. Don't underestimate the power of the S. Thought I was going to get my teeth bleached when I got in there. Naw just a molding. I'll start tonight. Ahh these pearly whites are gonna blind ya. Pick up my tray today. Yeah I got to hit the post office and send the box to MIA. Sorry it took so long. Procrasitination is very evil sometimes. Like you think your all ready for some type of meeting. And on the way you begin to read the paper they told you to bring. In bold you see,  "bring this paper and your transcript".  It sucks to be late but its God's plan. Maybe your weren't destined to arrive there on time because something better is supposed to happen. Always look toward the positive. I'm just waitin fo OASIS to open CHM2045L. Mrs. Rosa Get better.

      Ahh It's been a while. But Baby I'm Back! Since I didn't completely fill yall in on my expeditions I'll give a lil synopsis of them. I'm tellin you it's been crazy. From loosing the Gucci frames to arrivin with a new family member. Wow. But anyways my trips to NY, Alaska, and Vegas were so hype. First of all who said a subways is easy. Ahh with 2 huge suit cases we all were destined for trouble in the underground. You know you would think your Indian peeps would help you out. AHh but I soon realized the dude could have been Pakistani. Much love thou fo Pakistani peeps. But finally reached be to our destination the Franklin Inn. Those peeps with their continental breakfast were buggin. You know whateva free you gotz to get your hands on. But man the little muffins, bananas, and orange juice wasnt cool after 4 straight dayz. But you kno I caught a few broadways n lotz of shoes. K now ALASKA. 21 hours of straight sunlight. Your kiddin me. We got there at 11 it lookin like our 7 in FL. Man I neva got to see the night. I was so confused. I got to see Mrs. Alaska. You know maybe I was very ignorant when I went there but I was expecting to be the only black peep there.LOL. I was in Awe when I saw black peeps. LOL. But yeah the whale watchin was hype. But the guy with the snickers was fo real freakin me out. I'll pray fo him. Otha than that the market was crazy. Poor lady with the purple underwear.HAHAHA. That ish was so funny! Let me stop bein mean. That was my highlight really...the Saturday market sitting on the bench and just laughin. OKKK now Las Vegas is a very hype place. Yes Sin city. Porn everywhere its sad. I met a pimp fo the first time. Amazing. Too much game Mack Rob. I'll fo real pray fo you, definitely need Jesus. The worst thing that happened to me there was sitting in Celine Dion's show cold and sticky due to my sisters clumsiness with her   Virgin Strawberry Dacquiri  . I was pissed the whole time. It was a good show tho.(shakin my head, cuz you kno I just wanted to strangle her -LOL) Then my sister and I became the tour guides for about ten dudes from Cali. They were fine, but yea they thought we were ova 21. We just played it off knowin that we had to ditch em fast. LOL. Then got invited to an afta party for this dude that looked like Houston but with this huge thing on his ear. I couldn't help but to stare. Sorri. :-) Well then I was sexually harassed on the way to New York New York. I mean fo real u see and alright lookin girl yeah fine stare. But don't touch me. I don't know you. Damn what a pathetic guy. I should have had a total BF with him. But me cool and collected got out of that situation. I hope not all peep from Shock Town are like that. Nyways my trips were crazy and fun. I really enjoyed em. I'm so sorri I couldn't make the Roots. You kno I really wanted to make the trip. But authority always holdin you. Its a shame I could have been gazin into those light brown eyes.Imma hit my MIA up real soon. Been too long. Missed you so much. Aight well till the next post I'm out. 1
