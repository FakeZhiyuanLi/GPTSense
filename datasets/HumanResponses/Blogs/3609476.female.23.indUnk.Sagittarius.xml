      living in austin, i've always been able make-believe i don't live in texas.  austin is a very liberal, open minded city.  however, the moment i step outside of austin...reality comes crashing in....  for the past year or so i've had an anti-war bumper sticker on my car.  it says: "Attack Iraq? NO!"  yesterday i left austin to drive home to denton for the weeked.  about a half hour outside of austin a white corvette pulls up alongside me, the guy in the passenger seat was holding up a napkin w/ a message scribbled on it, it said: IRAQ SUCKS  well, i just happened to have some paper and a marker in my front seat (i'm a daycare teacher, so this isn't THAT unusual that i carry this stuff around with me).  I write:  KILLING FOR OIL SUCKS.  i catch up with them and flash 'em my sign.  a few minutes later, they retaliate with: TERRORIST LOVER :(   (yes, they included the frownie face).  ok, now i'm starting to get a little pissed off.  I come back with: PEACE LOVER &ne; TERROIST LOVER.  to this they reply: REMEMBER 9/11.  at this point i just give up, obviously these guys are too ignorant to separate iraq and 9/11, i'm not going to waste anymore time on them.  i keep driving and about five minutes later they pull up next to me, with one last sign:   SUPPORT U.S. TROOPS OR MOVE TO FRANCE   i couldn't stop laughing.....

      I take back every mean thing I've ever said about Hotmail! So my hotmail account has been at maximum capacity for several months...and I mean MAXIMUM CAPACITY.  I was hovering at 80% of my storage limit for the past few weeks.  I was planning, LITTERALLY, to upgrade my account today.  I figured $20/year wasn't that much for some extra space.  But when I logged on this morning...it said I was at 2%! Hmmmmmm...perplexing.  They just sent me an email saying they updated my accout to 100MB...FOR FREE!  I don't know why they've decided to be so nice to their users...but i'm not going to question it!!!

      Sorry for taking so long to post...this week has been really busy! Between working a BUNCH this week and dentist appointments (ahhhhh...i have to get my wisdom tooth removed! Thank god i only have one...and a tiny, deformed one at that!) it seems like i've barely been home.  The next few weeks will be just as nutty with 2 more dentist appointments and 3 doctors appointments (I'm desperately trying to cram all these in before i leave austin).   This weekend should be fun, I get to see No Doze* and The Dentist* this weekend in Dallas. No Doze has had a rough week, therefore a girl's night is in order.  Hopefully we'll be hitting up Deep Ellum...or maybe we'll just stay in and paint eachothers toenails and have pillow fights....um, yeah. It's seems like this summer is flying by.  June is almost gone and, like the other assistants, i'm LITTERALLY counting the days until i arrive in France (3 months exactly!!!!).  I guess it doesn't seem like summer because it's not really hot yet.  Don't get me wrong, things are still pretty steamy here, but we've yet to break 100... Plus I haven't been to  urlLink  Barton Springs  yet...so it DEFINATELY isn't summer yet!  *names changed to protect the guilty

      So I just got back from Spiderhouse (damn i'm going to miss that place! It was absolutely packed tonight.  It's by far my favorite place to go and people watch - sooooo many super cute indie boys....i digress...) where i met up with some fellow assistants from austin.  Both of them are ging to be in the Acad&eacute;mie de Rouen this fall, which is really close to Lille (in Normandy I believe).  It was nice to chat with some other people about our anxieties about the adventure that awaits us.  Unfortunately neither H. or S. have recieved their arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s yet, so my fingers are crossed for them!!! I met a nice lady at aveda today (one of THREE trips i've made there this weekend...don't ask) who was from scotland.  she gave me some great travel tips [1.) be sure to go to edinburgh and 2.) check out ryanair.com for CHEAP flights].  I love scottish accents, but thanks to mike myers I'll forever associate scotland with Fat Bastard.  Alas, this weekend has flown by without having gotten everything done...so i'm going to be a good little girl and try and write a letter to my lyc&eacute;e A+, nat

      This week just keeps getting better and better!  Not only is The Mountain Girl coming back from Brazil soon (I didn't think I'd get to see her before I left!!) but Lille sent me my arr&ecirc;t&eacute; yesterday, official stamp and all.  This is incredible, concidering most people don't get their's until August or September.  So now I can head down to Houston and get my visa.   I was supposed to babysit at 5:30  AM  this morning, but luckily it was canceled.  Damn, it's nice to sleep in for a change.  Anyone who knows me, knows I am NOT a morning person.  The recent work schedule change (i have to get there at 7:15am instead of noon!!!) has been a little rough, so sleeping in until 10:30 was absolutely heavenly.   After talking to The Dentist today, I'm so excited to be meeting up with my girls again.  All through college i've had this great group of ladies that have totally been my lifeline.  This past year we've all gone our separate ways (Dallas, Brazil, Spain, Nor-Cal...and lonely me still in Austin), but now everyone will be heading back to the states/texas for a bit.  I'm really glad I'll be able to see everyone before I leave for France.  I must say I'm quite suprised by how many people have visited my little blog (over 120 in one week!).  I'm glad eveyone is checking it out - feedback is always welcome, so leave some comments, people!  Lunch is calling...I hope everyone's saturday is as gorgeous as it is here in austin!

      Three cheers for the academie de lille for being on the ball.  I got a letter today telling me at what school i'll be teaching (unfortunately it's not the "official" letter i need to get a visa, but they say it'll be along soon!).  I'll be the english assistant for Lyc&eacute;e (lyc&eacute;e=highschool) Marguerite de Flandre in Gondecourt.  Gondecourt is about 12 miles south of Lille so theres a very good chance I'll be living in Lille and commuting to work everyday! This is incredible news since I was really scared that I'd be placed in a small town out in the boonies...see, i told you the gods were smiling on me today!

      I woke up this morning at 5:45 (15 minutes before i normally get up) with a headache and "shadows" by rufus wainwright stuck in my head (a song i hadn't heard in *at least* two years).  Luckily, i woke up when i did. You see, i had completely forgotten to set my alarm clock.  The gods are smiling on me today...

      ok...so when did commedians go from being funny to being inspirational speakers?  I rented  urlLink   Notorious C.H.O    (margaret cho stand up special) yesterday and the last 15 minutes of her stand up is devoted to this rant about how the media effects women's self esteem, and gay rights...etc...  now, i agree 100% about what she's saying, but i rented this movie to laugh my ass off...not to listen to her preach.  I noticed this on the last ellen degeneres special too...  why can they just stick to making people laugh?  ok, sorry...that was really bothering me...i feel better now...  so this weekend has been nice and mellow...with the exception of babysitting friday and saturday nights it's been two days of beautiful weather (yay!! the damn rain is FINALLY gone), reading (right now i'm reading  atonement  by ian mcewen...very good, i highly recommend it)...and watching movies...i'm halfway through  urlLink  sylvia    right now and i watched  urlLink   shattered glass   last night, in which hayden christansen actually gave a fairly decent performance (notice i used the word  fairly )...while he wasn't stellar it was at least better than star wars 1 & 2...  so anyways... sylvia  so far is pretty good...i've read  the bell jar  and i had heard about her suicide, so i knew going in that she wasn't the most stable minded person..but this movie portrays her as this jealous, anxiety-filled person, tortured by her writing and her husband...i just wonder how accurate the portrayal is...i guess it's just nice to see gwyneth paltrow using her american accent again...

      So this is the first post.  As you can tell from the url, I'm going to france this fall (sept 23rd!!!).  Preparations are underway...look out Lille...here I come... Right now i'm still in austin, which at the moment is not on my good list.  It's been raining non-stop for the past week.  Flash flooding, 100% humididty.  But I better get used to it, supposedly it rains even more in the north of france.   Well enjoy the blog and bear (thanks WSM - hehe!) with me while i figure out how to use this thing!

      Today was my last day at work.  I kept it together up until the last 10 minutes of work, then all the parents came to say good-bye and I got all weepy.  It was hard to say goodbye to SLICC (St. Luke Infant Care Center) and it will be even harder to say goodbye to Austin tomorrow.  Here's what I'll miss about Austin:  -Barton Springs -The best Tex-Mex!!! (Chango's, Trudy's, Polvo's, Chuey's) -The Alamo Drafthouse -Driving around Austin with you windows down -Spiderhouse/JP's Java -Austin in the summer, when everyone is gone from UT -Mt. Bonnell -SLICC -The Bats -KVRX -Korea Garden's incredible sushi lunch specials -Hyde Park -Bluebonnets in the spring -"Keep Austin Weird" -The incredible liberal, earth-concious, free-spirited vibe!!! -The parties -I luv video/vulcan/the movie store - how can I go back to Blockbuster now???? -Shopping on South Congress -Being able to go anywhere in this big city and run into someone you know  Things I won't miss about Austin:  -TRAFFIC!!!!!! (Why is every road under construction at the same time?) -Sorority girls talking on their cell phones while driving -HUGE SUV's and Pick-ups that try to cram into "compact car only" parking spaces -Being associated with George W.  (Boo!!) -Cedar Fever! -Fighting to get books the first week of class at the Co-Op -Frat boys on 6th street -Outrageous rent prices  ...well i know there are more things about austin that piss me off, but obviously the pros outway the cons.  If you've never visited Austin before, pack your things and come on down...you won't be disappointed!  It's been my home for the past 5 years and I'm sad to say goodbye.  But hey, leaving Austin gets me one step closer to France.....so, Adios Austin!!!!!

      This weekend has been crazy and fantastic.&nbsp;&nbsp;My girls were back in town and we spent saturday night at Arkansas Bend.&nbsp; It's right on Lake Travis so we spent most of the time swimming in the lake (which means we all left with tans, and some of us with sunburns).&nbsp; I went down to Houston on Sunday night.&nbsp; I stayed at The Dentist's new apartment and went and applied for my Visa.&nbsp; I must admit I was expecting more of the Consulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of some stately building, with french flags flying in front, I found a tiny office on the 6th floor of some bank building.&nbsp; I was assuming I could just wait and get the visa while I was in town, but apparently it takes 10 days to process.&nbsp; So they'll fedex it to me sometime next week.&nbsp; Fingers crossed they don't lose my stuff.&nbsp; It's nice to be one more step closer to leaving for France.&nbsp; (Less than 2 months till take-off) Moving prepartions continue without end.&nbsp; I've almost finished painting the apt and i never realized how much cozier the paint made it seem.&nbsp; The white is so stark and sterile.&nbsp; Sorry to end here, there is so much to talk about, but right now the lure of&nbsp;my cozy&nbsp;bed is stronger...nighty night.&nbsp; Enjoy some pictures in my absence!  Arkansas Bend...me and the crew&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink   &nbsp;  urlLink   urlLink  &nbsp;  I've been meaning to post this pic for a while. This mini-eiffel tower is in front of a french antique store here in austin. Every year the owner puts up this banner...Vive Lance! &nbsp; urlLink      urlLink   &nbsp;

      It finally hit me this week that my time here in austin is RAPIDLY coming to an end.&nbsp; Two weeks to go and I feel like I haven't gotten anything done.&nbsp; What have I been doing the past two months? Sitting on my ass, that's what!&nbsp; I guess the car accident set me back more than&nbsp;I realized.&nbsp; This weekend is going to be devoted to packing and *gulp* repainting my apartment.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to try to make it down to houston and get my visa at some point, but that would require translating a bunch of stuff into french...an idea that has become more and more terrifying.&nbsp; I've hardly spoken any French theses past seven months and when put on the spot yesterday, I totally choked.&nbsp; My physical therapist introduced me to one of his co-workers from Nancy, who's doing an internship here in Austin.&nbsp; He was very nice and very helpful (spoke PERFECT english).&nbsp; He has three kids and wife who are coming to visit next week and he needs a babysitter...I offered, and we'll see if he calls!&nbsp; Before I attempt to babysit in French,&nbsp;I better get some studying in...

      &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     So, i flew up to denton on saturday and picked up my new car! My dad found a great deal on a 2001 Corolla.  No more bumming rides and taking the bus for natalie!!  The flight was fine except for the frisking by airport security.  It seems that everyone with a one-way ticket is patted down and their baggage is searched.  They do it right in the open, in front of everyone going through security, so i guess it was good i didn't have anything embarassing in there.    Body cavity searches aside, I actually love flying.  I guess I'm one of the few people that actually enjoy airports.  Maybe it's the excitement of going somewhere new, the hope of a tall, dark and handsome seatmate (alas, no such luck this time) or the great news stands (i have a magazine fetish!).  I guess it was just exciting to realize that the next time I board a plane I'll be winging my way to France!!!  This past weekend was a dress rehersal for September!  I really wish I had brought my new camera (I finally go a Nikon FM10), we flew through some of the most amazing clouds.    The Mountain Girl came back from Brazil on friday.  We got to hang out at spider house briefly before my flight on saturday.  Sounds like she had a blast and it got me even more excited about iving abroad.    I started physical therapy here in Austin on tuesday and it's actually working!!!! One of the parents I babysit for is a P.T. and she recommended the  urlLink McKenzie Technique  for my whiplash.  Check it out, it's a pretty interesting method for dealing with back/neck pain.  I just hope I continue to improve, I've got A LOT of luggage to haul to Lille. Maybe I'll meet some cute frenchman on the plane who can help me carry all my bags...

      Sorry for taking so long to update.  This past week, however, has been a little nutty.  Last weekend, while going down to dallas to visit No Doze and The Dentist, I hydroplaned out of control and wrecked my car.  Thank goodness i didn't hit someone else and no one was in the car with me.  I lost control of the car, under a bridge, and slammed into a pillar.  The passenger side is completely crushed....pretty scary.  Luckily, no bones were broken, just whiplash...which i've had before.  I'm doing physical therapy (lots of massages....yessss!!!).  So the past week i've been in denton, letting my mommy take care of me.    Since i'm car-less, my mom drove me back to austin yesterday.  I went up to work and all my kids in my class room gave me these looks like, "who the hell are you?"...geesh, i've only been gone for a week and they've completely forgotten me.  It seems kind of pointless, now, coming back to austin.  I'm moving in 4 weeks...so it hardly seems worth coming back to work, especially since i'm not sure how much i'll be able to do w/my back hurting like it is.  we'll see...
