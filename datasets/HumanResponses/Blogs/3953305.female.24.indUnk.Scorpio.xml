       An evening of Old English and Ridiculous fun   Yesterday was the first time Shakespeare has ever been performed in Spencer Smith Park. A momentous occasion to be sure! They modernized it a bit with costumes and musical numbers, but kept Billy Shake's language the same. This might make my sound uncultured but I find Shakespearean language about as difficult to understand as French: I get it, but it takes a bit of concentration, and it's  definitely  not English. My german grandmother did not get it. When asked if she enjoyed the play she replied: "It's nice to be in the fresh air."  The play was a midsummer night's dream, one of the ones with lots of ridiculous fun.  The actors appeared to have lots of ridiculous fun performing and the audience had lots of ridiculous fun watching.  There's another performance tonight and I urge all the Burlington peeps to go see it (she says as if anyone really reads her blog).  It's pay as you go (they suggest 12 bucks a person but you can put five cents in the bag and noone will be the wiser).  Plus they have a draw for free dinner tickets (I know Becca is lucky about that kind of thing).   ***

        Either the women of Stepford are androids or they have chips in their heads.   Make up your mind!   If they are women with chips in their heads they would not be able to operate like an ATM, and you wouldn't need a duplicate Nicole Kidman body.  If they are androids, how would it be possible to change them back at the end (oops, spoiler).  I was torn as to what rating to give this movie.  It has good comedic value with lots of good one-liners. Fave line, when all the android/chip-in-the-head wives are talking about what kind of decorations you can make with pinecones Bette Midler says: "And I'm going to attach a pinecone to my vibrator and have a really merry Christmas."  However, a great cast and hillarious one-liners is not enough for a sci-fi nut like me to ignore the most gigantic plot hole I've seen yet.   *   BTW: One of these days I'll see the original.  I want to see how it compares.

      I love when the newspaper has good news.  And pictures of doggies.   urlLink TheStar.com - City's best friend? Dante   Also, note Dante is a pound puppy.  Proof positive that pound puppies are better than pure breds.

      Yesterday I told Adam that he is just like Dinomir only not purple. Adam is not a former french immersion student, however, so he went "who?"  So today I went on a mission to find I picture of Dinomir to show him (no small task since I'd forgotten how it's spelled).  After some searching I found this:  urlLink Dinomir va au zoo de Lille   It's in French but if you aren't a frenchie like me you can still look at the pictures and appreciate how this big friendly giant is just like my husband to be.

       Adam bought   Hellboy   on DVD.&nbsp; I had not seen it because I thought it looked like a movie about a man in full body   red paint   running around saying "Aw, crap".   My little sister (I should stop calling her my little sister since she is 20 and has a son) took offence to my fiancé's purchase, loudly proclaiming: "That is the stupidest movie ever! It's about a little devil boy that was raised to be good! Totally stupid."&nbsp; I thought that premise sounded kind of neat, actually, and&nbsp;Rob (the sister)&nbsp;thinks that Star Trek is boring, so all her opinions are suspect.   So I watched the flick with Adam.&nbsp; It is indeed a movie about a man in full body red paint running around saying "Aw, crap" but once you get past that it's pretty good.&nbsp; It has all the overdone special effects and predictability that you'd expect and love in any super hero movie.&nbsp; Plus it's got big ugly monsters!&nbsp; My favourite character is the psychic fishman that sounds like Niles.   One problem:&nbsp; when one dies, two shall rise .&nbsp; So how does killing them all help in any way?&nbsp;&nbsp;    **

      I apologized to Hunter but he was already over it and Mom didn't make a fuss about my outburst which, for my mom, is the same thing as apologizing to me—neither of us were acting like grown-ups, eh?   Anyway, I had tastey ribs and a tastey salad (to negate the unhealthiness of the ribs).&nbsp;&nbsp; For&nbsp;dessert my brother and sister and I had&nbsp;each had a different dessert and everyone tried everyone else's.&nbsp; We all agreed mine was the best.&nbsp; I am the best dessert picker ever!&nbsp; Hunter had fun eating Kraft Dinner and playing&nbsp;Connect Four (the rules of which are&nbsp;considerably different when you're three).&nbsp;    I should have changed my underwear too .

      I was eating out&nbsp;with the family (brother, sister, mom, dad, grandmother, nephew) and my three-year-old nephew happened to sit down right across from me where the&nbsp;server had just placed a large glass of beer.&nbsp; Hunter (the nephew) proclaimed "I don't like beer" and pushed the glass over, getting the beer all over my lap.&nbsp;   I don't think I yelled, but I might have because I was  really ticked off!    There's nothing quite as uncomfortable as an entire&nbsp;pint of ice cold beer in your lap . Anyway my mother was making fun of me, the way she loves to do (because everyone knows I am her least favourite daughter).&nbsp; When I said "Could you guys get me some napkins?&nbsp; I need lots of them!"&nbsp; Mom said in a snotty voice: "I need napkins. Get me napkins."&nbsp;    I said:  "FU alright? It's not all over you!!" &nbsp; Only I didn't use initials.&nbsp; Those of you that know me, know that I NEVER swear, especially in front of old ladies and children so you can tell how  super ticked off  I was.   I'm just home now to change my pants and am blogging to let off steam.&nbsp; I'm going to apologize to Hunter for yelling (he didn't mean to spill the beer) but the rest of them can go to that mythical place underground where the devil lives.

      I started my second week of volunteering at the  urlLink Burlington Art Centre  today.&nbsp; This time I'm helping in the kinderart class.&nbsp; There are&nbsp;eight kids aged&nbsp;four to seven.&nbsp; Guess what:&nbsp;I remember all their names again!&nbsp;  I am a name remembering Genius. &nbsp; You guys will have to take my word for it though.&nbsp; I can list the teenagers names no prob, but with little kids you have to at least pretend to be net savy.&nbsp; (People who&nbsp;run kiddie porn&nbsp;sites probably got started by putting little kids names in their blogs).   Anyway, the kids were great and the teacher, Deb (she's old enough to have her name in here) was really great.&nbsp; The class was only half a day long and she already covered everything I learned in first year university:  p  r  i  m  a  r  y   c  o  l  o  u  r  s  ,  still life, landscape, painting and drawing.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of the week they should give these kids a BA!&nbsp; (Although I doubt there'll be any art history).

      I woke up this morning and my leg was asleep.&nbsp;  I hate that .   Anyway, here is&nbsp; the second digi pic I have decided to post.&nbsp; It is slightly out of focus (my camera sucks) but you can still read the card.&nbsp;&nbsp; Back while I was at  urlLink Nip &nbsp;the Christian Club was giving out free sundaes.&nbsp; While I'm not too fond of organized religion, I do love ice cream.&nbsp; Of course Christians aren't Christians&nbsp;unless they are trying to convert you— all those Christians out there know I'm kidding right? —so they also gave out business cards with a preachy bible quote on them.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't sure what ice cream had to do with Jesus, but I thought it was funny so I put the card in the empty bowl and took a picture.   So here it is:        This seems like a good time to link to  urlLink my favourite atheist message board .

      I did an image search for "Adam and Jen".&nbsp; It's amazing how many people there are named Jen, whose significant other is named Adam.&nbsp;  It made me feel quite average actually .&nbsp; Amazingly enough, I found  urlLink a picture of myself  and it didn't have Adam in it. I don't usually find myself when I do searchs so I wonder why this particular pic showed up on this particular search.&nbsp; The Google elves amaze me.   Anyway here's a weird picture that I also found when I searched for&nbsp;"Adam and Jen":   &nbsp;  I can only assume that the knight with the  suggestive sheild  is Adam.&nbsp; Jen must be one of the ants.&nbsp; Or both of the ants (since it is such a common name).&nbsp; Jen could be the flies too, but they don't seem very feminine.

      I was inspired by  urlLink a young man in Joe's photo class  to put some of my photos on the internet.&nbsp; Since I got my digi, I've been randomly taking pictures of things, signs and such, that I think are cool.&nbsp; (Unfortunately&nbsp;many of them are out of focus, but that's okay because that's how myopic people like me see the world.) I always had the intention of putting them on-line but like many things I have the intention of doing I didn't end up finis...   Anyway here is a picture I took of a hotdog vendor in Toronto, in July, when Adam and I went to see the indi car race.&nbsp; It is entitled:         Hot Hot Hot  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Yesterday me and Adam finally saw   The Day After Tomorrow  .&nbsp; Adam had seen it before but he said he "wouldn't mind seeing it again"&nbsp; so we went.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a disaster movie à la  Armageddon ,  The Core , or  Deep Impact .&nbsp; Lots of special effects and what not.&nbsp; Almost everyone on Earth dies but almost all the main characters survive.&nbsp; That sort of thing.   If you haven't seen it SEE IT NOW while it is still in theatres.&nbsp;  This is the type of movie that you're buddy will exclaim to you:  "  You haven't seen THAT MOVIE? Oh my GOD!  You HAVE to see it   !"  so he will rent the DVD and you will watch it together and you will say: "  That's lame  "  and he will reply "   Well, you should have seen it on the   BIG SCREEN .       It kicked butt on the  BIG SCREEN   .  "   Not that it was the best movie in the history of time or anything, I just don't think it would be that good on a tiny TV.&nbsp; Worth seeing.&nbsp;   ***   or   ****   (out of   *****   ).

      Today was my first day volunteering at the  Art Centre .&nbsp; I'm helping in a teen photography class (who would've thought my uni photo class would ever be useful), instructed by a guy named Joe.&nbsp; Joe has a sense of humour so I like him.  &nbsp;  The class has&nbsp;eight kids in it: Emily, Jenna, Nate, Cameron, Jay, Leia, Laura, and Amy.&nbsp; I am impressed with myself for remembering that.&nbsp; Amy has a learning disability so I was called in to volunteer so Joe wouldn't have to spend all his time with her.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Amy had an orthodontist appointment and didn't come until lunch.&nbsp; She couldn't develop the film or anything because at the  Art Centre   they turn off the lights  instead of using   black bags  , so everyone has to do the same thing at the same time  or bust .&nbsp; I helped her make some photograms (just chucking stuff on photo paper and exposing it) but you could tell she wasn't pleased about not being able to develop her negatives.&nbsp; That's what you get for having crooked teeth I guess.  &nbsp;  I made a photogram of my face that turned out pretty neat&nbsp;and then it was&nbsp;3:30 and it was time to go.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   Later &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; When I got home there was a message for me from a recruiter who wanted to interview me for a management training position at a car rental company.&nbsp;  It's always been my dream to manage a rental car company .&nbsp;  Yeah that's it .&nbsp;  Anyway,&nbsp;this recruiter&nbsp;must have read my last blog entry. That's the only explanation.&nbsp; He said he saw my résumé on Workopolis but he was probably too embarrassed to admit he recruits people by reading their blogs.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So anyway he asks me a whole bunch of questions about my retail experience and how I deal with difficult people and about my leadership strategy (yeah, because I   totally   have a leadership strategy).&nbsp; I told him I would be a good leader because I'm a good listener or some BS. &nbsp; Hopefully I'll get a job at this place, make a few bucks, and then land my dream job doing something creative.&nbsp; Like winning the 649.

      For those&nbsp;of you who don't know (as if anyone reads this blog) my Dad's been out of work for almost a year.&nbsp; He got layed off from  evil   Royal Bank . Well today he got a job right here in Burlington, making pretty much what he used to make when he worked for Satan.&nbsp; Eat your heart out  Royal demons ! &nbsp; This seems like a  dream come true , but of course Daddy actually has to work there for a bit before he can decide if this is a fab job, or a bad job. &nbsp; While we're on the subject of jobs, is there anyone out there in internetland who wants to hire me?&nbsp; I'm really very intelligent.&nbsp; I'm good at art and writing (even got a University degree in those two things) and I'm good with people.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; I know everyone says they're good with people, but I am.&nbsp; Even scary people who won't pay their late fines (I worked at Blockbuster Video for 2 years).&nbsp; One time my manager even said that he's "never seen anything like it" refering to how I "remain pleasant and professional even with difficult customers".&nbsp; I'm just very friendly. If you're interested in seeing my resumé (because all job recruiting is done by reading blogs) then  urlLink e-mail  me and I'll send it to you. &nbsp; Okay I'm not serious, I know noone is reading this blog who has any hiring power.&nbsp;  &nbsp; No actually I am serious,  hire me!

         Adam and I just finished reading the  Neanderthal Paralax , a trilogy by Robert J. Sawyer which includes   Hominids  ,   Humans  , and   Hybrids  .&nbsp; The story is about a portal accidentally opening between our world and a parallel universe inhabited by Neanderthals.&nbsp; This sounds like an episode of  Sliders , but Sawyer's in depth descriptions of real scientific theory&nbsp;lends realism to the novels (keeps them from being Hokey).&nbsp; Sawyer has a good sense of humour in his writing, too.&nbsp; Plus, the bulk of the&nbsp;trilogy is set in Sudbury, Ontario.&nbsp; Très cool.  &nbsp;  I do have a beef about  Hybrids  (the 3rd book) and it concerns the character of Mary Vaughan, a geneticist who experiences a brutal rape, and later falls in love with Ponter Boddit, a neanderthal physicist who loves Coca Cola.&nbsp; For one of the world's foremost geneticists,  Mary is a bit of a nimrod .&nbsp; I constantly want to shake her as she takes pages and pages to figure out stuff that the reader (that's&nbsp;me)&nbsp;gets&nbsp;after one sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her idiocy can be explained away in the first book because she is distracted by having just been raped, by the third it is no longer an excuse.&nbsp; She's supposed to be an überintelligent geneticist who gets published in all the prestigious journals.&nbsp; Sawyer mentions all these papers she's published, and her prestige around the world,&nbsp; then turns around and hints that the only reason she got a York University tenure position is because of affirmative action hiring practices.&nbsp; What's up with that, Rob?  &nbsp;  Nevertheless,  I highly recommend  the trilogy to anyone who likes science fiction.&nbsp; Adam liked it too.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      The neat thing about the banner ads on this blog is that they actually seem to be paying attention to what I write. When I wrote about Glycolic Peel there was an ad for it. Now there's an ad for engagement rings because of my ring adventures.    Here is a test of this magic banner ad system:   Star Trek . Subaru. Oldsmobile. Teeth Whitening. Penis Enlargement. Lose Weight Now! George Clooney.  Wonder Woman .  Keannu Reeves .  Orlando Bloom . Curveside Prophet.

      For those of you who don't know, I have the most beautiful engagement ring in the history of the universe.&nbsp; A diamond solitaire with a  thick   yellow-gold  band.&nbsp; Best of all, it is engraved with the phrase  qamuSHa'qu  which means "I love you very much" in klingon.&nbsp; Or should I say I  had  a beautiful engraved ring.&nbsp; It is currently being held hostage at the jewelry store.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well it turns out that Barry's Jewelers  the diamond super store  doesn't do gold all that well.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The story:  &nbsp;    Friday July 9    &nbsp;  I took my ring to Barry's because there was a tiny crack in it - right at the&nbsp; S  in  qamuSHa'qu  (where they sized&nbsp;it).&nbsp; There, I&nbsp;show it to a middle-aged woman with bleached blond hair and an unidentified European accent.&nbsp; Blondie took my beloved ring to the back&nbsp;to converse briefly with the mole people (I assume) during which time three people ask if I'm "being taken care of".  &nbsp;  She returns. "It is broken" (duh) "You probably banged it somewhere."  This thing has been on my finger 24/7 since April so yeah, I probably banged it somewhere, but is this not supposed to be  a high-quality piece of jewlery  that will last me 50 years?  &nbsp;  Blondie says that fixing the crack is no charge but I have to pay 10 bucks to have it re-inscribed.&nbsp; "Fine."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have to write my name, phone number, and qamuSHa'qu on a slip of carbon paper.&nbsp; Blondie says the ring is guaranteed to be ready next friday (the 16th) and&nbsp;but she will call if it is ready before then.  &nbsp;  Naturally, surrendering my ring depresses me so much I have to buy a girl action figure (I collect girl action figures).&nbsp; The girl I choose is this creepy woman called Angelique whose scalp has been partially peeled showing her skull.&nbsp; The scalp is being tied to her shoulders with wires.&nbsp; Poor Angelique, but at least you didn't have to  surrender your engagement ring .     Thursday, July 15    &nbsp;  The week drags by.&nbsp; I miss my ring terribly.&nbsp; I try wearing the giant ruby ring my grandmother gave me; I&nbsp;try wearing a mood ring.&nbsp; Nothing fills the void.&nbsp;&nbsp;My family and fiancé all agree that it is hideously unfair for me to have to pay 10 dollars for something that is obviously their fault.  &nbsp;  I ask my fiancé to call Barry's and lay the heavy on them.&nbsp; Apparently the girl he talks to agrees that I should not pay a cent, but can't tell him if my ring is ready without the lot number.  &nbsp;  I dig up the slip of carbon paper which (apparently) has the magic number on it and call myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Is my ring ready yet?"  "Lot number?"  I&nbsp;start reading out the most obvious number on the slip of carbon paper.  "Not that number, silly" (she didn't actually call me silly but it was in the tone).  I examine the paper and find&nbsp;the number 28 scribbled on the top. "Um, 28?"  "Your name please."  "Jen McNicoll."  "And what was the item?"  "An engagement ring." Honestly, how many lot 28s do they have?  She holds the phone away from her head so she can pretend to check for me (I assume).  "Unfortunately we are so swamped that we can't get anything done even a bit early."  "But it will be ready by&nbsp;tommorrow?"  "Rest assured that if it&nbsp;was promised for tommorrow then it will be ready."  "What time?"  "Any&nbsp;time tommorrow will be fine."   So,&nbsp;the ring isn't ready late Thursday but it will be ready  any time  on Friday?&nbsp; Unless they are soldering and engraving at 1 am, this seems highly unlikely.&nbsp; They must mean "anytime they feel like it."  &nbsp;    Friday, July 16th    &nbsp;  I go over to my fiancé's house early so we can go to Barry's&nbsp;together before he has to work.&nbsp; (I figure if he's with me they're less likely to treat me like a quibbling moron).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The store doesn't open 'till ten so I have an hour an a half before I&nbsp;can even call to check&nbsp;on my ring.&nbsp; Adam makes me a yummy breakfast.  &nbsp;  Adam calls the idiot store at 10 am on the dot and asks if my ring is ready yet.&nbsp; "Lot 28....a solitaire engagement ring....under the name Jen McNicoll....okay, okay, okay....and when will it be ready?...ok, thank you."  Report: the ring is fixed but it isn't engraved yet.&nbsp; The engraver doesn't come in until 12 (lazy) so I have to wait until  2pm  to pick up my ring.  &nbsp;  It turns out Adam's work doesn't need him so we hang out and do fiancé and fiancée stuff until 2 (we play Rummykub).&nbsp; Finally it's 2pm and we go to the Mapleview mall to Barry's Jewelers and talk to a skinny guy with a blue suit and a bushy mustache.  "We're here to pick up lot 28, a solitaire engagment ring under the name Jen McNicoll."  Bushystache retrieves my ring from the mole people.  We told Bushystache&nbsp;about all the people who thought&nbsp;that paying ten bucks was hideously unfair.  "So you're not going to pay this ten dollars?"  "No, we're not."  Bushystache gives me a look as if I am the cheapest&nbsp;girl in the history of time but he surrenders my ring without the randsom money. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I'm happy until I see the inscription.  &nbsp;  First of all it's all off to the side instead of centred.&nbsp; Second of all it says qamuSHa'gu instead of quamuSHa'qu!&nbsp; We show Bushystache and goes to ask the mole person to take the tail off the g.&nbsp; He even shows me the letters "q" and "g" so that I can see that qs are just gs without tails. After the kindergarten lesson is over Bushystache gives me back my ring with a big dent where the tail used to be.&nbsp;  "Okay, now get rid of the dent."  "What dent?"&nbsp; Bushystache puts the ring in a contraption so we can watch the ring on tv.&nbsp; The dent is even more huge and obvious.  "THAT DENT" (duh).  Bushystache shows the ring to the mole people.&nbsp; He returns.&nbsp; "This is not an easy fix.&nbsp; We have to add gold and redo the inscription."  "So long as you're doing that could you centre it please."  "Ok pickypants." (He didn't actually say pickypants but it was in the tone).  My fiancé pretends that we have an "event" to go to on Sunday and must have the ring before then. Good thinking Adam!  "We are so swamped here I don't know if it will be possible you should wait until after the event."  "No just do it now."&nbsp; The only reason they are swamped is because their rings are all cracked and dented with mispelled inscriptions. Idiots.  He writes  Saturday??  on the carbon paper in big letters, as well as  centre it please .&nbsp; I'm sure there's still something else they can screw up.  &nbsp;    I want my ring back!!!

        I'm not sure where I took this picture. Probably in a public washroom on the way to North Bay, that was a time when I was into photos of signs in public washrooms. I enjoy taking pictures in washrooms (not of people, you perverts). It's not something many people would think of doing. I took a picture of this sign because I like the graphic of the toilet. Boys will probably find this picture interesting as it offers  a glimpse inside the no-man's land that is the woman's washroom . (How many boys have actually seen a sign asking them not to flush feminine hygiene products?)    I'd like to see someone try to flush a diaper!

      Adam is busy with work today so I decided to call one of my other friends and do something fun. To my horror I discovered: I have no other friends! Okay, friends who are reading this are probably saying: "We're your friends, Jen." And you are right. However, the problem is  you have lives . For some reason none of you sit at home by the phone waiting for me to call you. As such,  I am bored to tears . Now's a good time to tell you fictitious blog-readers (fictitious because all my real friends have lives) about the fab day I had yesterday:  Adam and I went to Toronto to see the 2pm showing of  Urinetown  (Mom bought us tickets for Adam's birthday). It's a musical comedy about a world where there's a drought and people have to pay to use the washroom. Those who can't or won't pay get exiled to Urinetown. Hilarious.  *****   After the show, we went down to the  Science Centre  because we'd heard about some blackout-anniversary star-gazing thing.  We learned that the exhibits close at 6 pm and the star thing starts at 8 pm (it was 5:20 or so at the time).  Apparently, there is no way to see Science Centre exhibits for free or at a discount.  Even if you come forty minutes before closing, you still have to pay $14 per adult (yes, you are an adult. If they consider me an adult, then you DEFINITELY are).     We had time to kill so we went out for dinner at a Chinese Restaurant.  We ordered "Dinner for Two" which was more than enough for two even though the food was tastey and one of us is a 6-foot-2 Polish boy (that would be Adam).  The people at the next table ordered Duck and it came to the table with the head still attached.   After dinner we went back to the Science Centre.  The star thing was free so we figured it was our kind of thing.  We waited around for a while and finally it was 8 pm.  This guy named Terrence Dickenson (that name may mean something to astronomers) gave a slide presentation on astronomy, star-gazing and light polution.  I learned that the hubble telescope is so powerful that it can see all the way to the edge of the universe, or at least what the edge of the universe looked like 13.7 billion years ago.  Astronomy is wild.  After the talk we went out to the parking lot where a bunch of telescopes were set up.  This was very hokey.  It was too cloudy (the McNicoll Badweatherluck Phenomenon) to see the edge of the universe, or even the planets in our solar system (except Earth, you could see Earth).  One guy had his telescope pointed at an office window (the blinds were shut).  There was also a story teller who told myths involving stars and moons and such.  All of the stories contridicted what the astronomer said but were fun to listen to anyway.  A good time was had by all.

      Today is the one-year anniversary of the biggest blackout in the history of time.  Everyone from North Bay to New Jersey lost power.   Over 50 million people could not watch television or play computer games .  (I think it was the Americans' fault).  The blackout anniversary is getting a lot of news coverage (Newspapers love anniversaries because that means they can run last year's article by searching for every instance of the word "today" and replacing it with "last year".  Then they take the rest of the day off.)  In the spirit of lazy journalism, this is what I did on   August 14th, 2003  :  At the time, I worked at Stoney Creek Library.   Some kids were telling me about their stories when the lights suddenly went out.  There was enough light in the children's area for us to continue talking about books until the head children's librarian came and told me that they were going to close the library (lazies) and that the power outage has reached all the way to the states.  At the time I thought:  How is that even possible?   Driving home was insane.  The highway was okay, but as soon as I exited to somewhere with lights it became ridiculous.  It was like the end of the world.  Either a)Nobody knows that lights that aren't working should be treated as four-way stops, b)Nobody knows how to behave at four-way stops, or c)Everyone thought it was the end of the world and behaved accordingly.  I made it home in one piece.  The power in my house was restored almost immediately after I got there.  We didn't even have to eat our ice cream (everyone knows that the first thing you do in a power failure is eat your ice cream so that it won't melt).  I've heard one theory that my house got its power back quickly because we are on the same line as a hospital, and therefore a high priority.  But don't hospitals have generators?  Anyway my Dad thinks it's a rip-off.  The greatest blackout in the history of time and we lost power for twenty minutes!  We spent the rest of the day watching movies.   Eat your heart out New York City!

      Omi 1 's brother Siegfried and his wife are over from Germany and yesterday we went out for dinner at a greek place in Hamilton. We being me, Mom, Dad, Omi, Craig 2 , Uncle Siegfried, Uncle Siegfried's wife.  Siegfried took a course in English for seniors back in Germany.  He says that he though he was pretty good at English until he came to Canada.  Now he realizes he hardly speaks it at all.  It was fun trying to see how much I could understand using my high school German.  I was feeling pretty good about myself because I could understand everything my Mom says in German.  Of course this was because a)she was speaking half-English b)she does actions with her hands and c)I know what my Mom is going to say.  Understanding Siegfried was a little trickier. My Mom translated what he said.  She even translated when he spoke English.  Sure Uncle Siegfried has an accent but, Mom,  I can understand English .  My Mom's crazy.  Craig whispered in my ear periodically "What are they saying?" Sometimes I knew the gyst of the conversation and told him.  Most of the time I had no clue (unless they were talking about the weather, colours, or numbers, I was pretty much at a loss).   Anyway, now seems like a good time to tell you a song that I remember from German class.    ICH BIN AUSLANDER  3     (sung to the tune of "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain")     ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deutsch ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deutsch bitte langsam, bitte langsam bitte spreche sie doch langsam ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deustch  ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deustch ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deustch ich versteh' nicht, was sie sagen ich versteh' nicht, was sie sagen ich bin auslander und spreche nicht gut deutsch.     1.  Omi means grandma in German.  Everyone calls her "Omi" regardless of whether they are related to her or not.  My friends who have met my grandmother tell tales about her to this day.  She is quite a character.    2.  My brother.  I also have a sister named Robin but she had to stay home with Hunter (her son).  Plus she didn't want to come anyway because: a)She had a friend over and b)Omi is always going on and on about how I am her favourite grandaughter.    3.  Basically this song means: "I'm a foreigner and don't speak very good German.  Please speak slowy.  I don't understand what you're saying."

      Drive-ins are fabulous. You get to see two flicks for the price of one AND snuggle at the same time. Not to meantion the fact that you get to watch retro cartoons with dancing snacks. I give those dancing snack cartoons  ***** !   Collateral     A cab driver drives a hitman around. Tom Cruise plays the hitman. Not bad, but not as all fire exciting as you might imagine.   *     Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy    This movie is hillarious. One of the finest in stupid-in-a-good-way comedy.   ***   So there you have it: nothing beats those dancing snack cartoons.

      This is a momentous occasion because now I have the option of the Clark Kent look or the Superman look. Actually I should say the Diana Prince look or the Wonder Woman look, since I am obviously NOT a man. Anyway, the point is: with my glasses-free vision powers,  I could be a super hero!   I wore them 4 hours today and I have to slowly work up to a billion trillion hours. It's not exactly the same as having my nearsightedness miraculously cured, but it brings me closer to my goal of not being  urlLink the ugly one .  Now I need to get myself some non-perscription sunglasses so I don't go blind at the age of 50 from the ultra-violet rays.

      Today was the best day to maybe be on camera for Cinderella Man 1 . The scene is: we're standing in line to get soup because we are so dirt poor we need handouts. The crew were giving out kids as if they were props ("Here, have a soup bowl, and a child.") My "son" was five years old and by far the cutest of the bunch. Renée Zellweger's kids were supposed to splash in the puddles and my son got to splash with them! When Renée called her kids back I was supposed to step out of line, grab my kid's arm, pull him back in line and mime yelling at him 2 . Robbie (my pretend son) had to go to the washroom at least once an hour. He would look up at me with these big brown eyes and whisper " I have to pee ." I would whisper " wait until they say cut " and then when they said "cut" I would yell  "BATHROOM BREAK!"  Halfway throught the shoot Robbie started to cry because he didn't want to do it anymore. By this time my feet were so sore from the period 1930s footwear that I wanted to cry too. I took him to an AD 3  who took him to his real mom. Robbie had a nap on his real mom's shoulders and then went right back to action. What a trooper!   And:   I talked to Renée Zellweger!   She was walking past me and she looked at me and smiled. So I said " Hello ." And she said " Hello. How are you ?" And I said " Very well. Thank you ." I was very sincere too because (even though I was sore from the shoes, and I was wet from the splashing, and I was warm from the winter coat and the August sun) at that moment I was talking to  The  Renée Zellweger! I was  very well!   Thank you!  Then Renée said " It's warm ". And I sort of smiled in agreement. Totally cool.   1 A period 1930s movie about a boxer that I've been doing background work on for a few days this summer. It stars Renée Zellweger and Russell Crowe. 2 My Oscar moment. 3 Assistant Director.

        I saw Catwoman the other day and neglected to review it until now. I know this has been getting a lot of bad reviews. Were they expecting Spiderman? Come on now. Catwoman's powers include walking on furniture and standing up for herself.  Halle Berry played Catwoman (obviously). Sharon Stone, the mom from Six Feet Under, and the Law and Order dude from Miss Congeniality were also in it.  As long as you go in expecting a cheesey comic book movie (ie not Spiderman) I think you will enjoy it. It comes just short of being good. I'd say the movie is catered towards women since the romantic plot overpowers much of the flick and the Catwoman-seeks-revenge plot revolves around the evils of face cream. Fortunately for the guys, there is that scanty leather S and M outfit Catwoman finds so stylin'.  All in all pretty good, but not Oscar-the-Grouch winning stuff.   **

      Time interview was scheduled for:  12:30 pm    10:50  Got in the car and headed for the far side of the universe  11:00  Stuck in traffic  12:00  Stuck in traffic, again. Began to imagine what I would say to the interviewers if I arrived late.  12:30  Arrived at the far side of the universe in the nick of time. Signed in at the front desk, got a nametag, and waited with 10-15 other applicants.  1:20  Finally got called in to get interviewed by a man named "Jason". He seemed friendly. Same ol' interview questions, blah blah blah.  1:40  Wrote a dead-simple test (to make sure I have a brain). Sample question: "We charge 8% shipping and handling on orders over $3o. How much shipping and handling should you charge on a $90 order? $12.21, $5.00, $7.03, or $7.20?" Totally stupid.  1:45  Went to the cafeteria with the other applicants to wait for my second interview. A woman named "Helen" put on a video about how gosh darn great it is to work at Scholastic (the far side of the universe). The theme music for the video was from the Little Mermaid.  2 pm  Video ended.  2:30  All other applicants have been called for their second interview except me. A woman comes out of nowhere and tells me that they haven't forgotten me and thanks me for my patience.  3:10  Got called in for a second interview with a woman named "Carolyn". She asked the same questions as "Jason". Honestly, they were almost word for word exactly the same.  3:28  Left the farside of the universe.  3:30  Returned to the farside of the universe because I realized they forgot to ask for my references (not a good sign).  3:31  Left the far side of the universe (for real this time).  4:45  Arrived home.

      I have an interview today at 12:30 for the Scholastic call centre in Markham.  Markham!  (That's far).  Anyway I'm wearing my new interview outfit (white capris with a grey button down top,  très chique ) so I should have no trouble landing this job.  But Markham!?  Do I want this job?  Mapquest says it takes an hour and two minutes to get there.  So if you read this before 12:30, post a message of good luck (again, I'm pretending not to be talking to myself here).

      I apologize to all my faithful blog readers (yeah right) for not blogging all weekend. I was away from the computer because I was at Amy's house. Amy's parents were away all weekend and I came over to help look after Amy's sister Steph. This is a really sweet deal because I get to hang out with my best friend and her sister all weekend and  get paid for it!   Sweet deal, eh? For those of you who don't know, Steph is a quadriplegic, so that's how come she needs someone to look after her (even though she's 21 or 22 years old now). I have huge Arnie arm muscles from lifting her! (no, not really but I do have a fat bum from sitting on it watching movies all the time). Here is the blow-by-blow of the weekend:    Saturday   I got up at 8:40 because I had set my alarm for 9 and for some reason I always get up 20 minutes before my alarm regardless of what time I set it to (one time I had to get up at 3am and I woke up at 2:40, no kidding). Anyway, I got all ready, packed my stuff for Amy's, made eggs for me and my Dad, called Amy to say I was coming, then Dad drove me to Amy's in his Mustang. When I got there Amy was still in her pjs. We watched Justice League for an hour and a half and then watched the movie of the day. The movie of the day was  Princess Diaries  1  because the sequel is coming out so so naturally we had to watch the first one again (Amy and Steph are into girlie movies). Then we went shopping for food (Amy was wearing clothes by this time) because Amy was planning to have people over for waffles on Sunday. Adam works in the same plaze as the Fortinos we went to so naturally we had to visit him. We invited him to come to dinner after work. After visiting Adam's work (Mailboxes etc.) we went to the Roger's next door and rented  Cinderella II  2  and watched it (duh). Adam came over after work and we ordered chicken wings (honey garlic for me and Adam, mild for Amy and Steph). We had Snickers ice cream with chocolate and caramel sauce for dessert. Yum! Adam picked a movie from Steph's collection to watch ( Short Circuit  3  ). After that  Staying Alive  4  was on tv (Adam thought it was a boring movie so he went home. Later, Amy and I watched celebrity trash tv until midnight and then went to bed.     Sunday    Amy made Steph promise not to wake us before 8am. So at 8 o'clock on the dot she woke us up (well Amy woke up, I slept a few dozen more minutes). We started getting the brunch ready because everyone was supposed to come at 11 (fat chance). Amy made the waffles and I cut strawberries and washed blueberries. When that was done, we watched Amy's tape of Dawson's Creek (that show is so depresso!) and waited for people to come. My fabulous boy was the only one who was on time (yeah Adam!). This girl Terrence showed up a few minutes after eleven (not bad at all especially since she brought homemade jam and maple syrup). Karen came at 11:45 (but brought cool whip). And the other 2 (Kelly and Blaire) came at noon!  Noon!  Anyway we went out on the patio and ate waffles with berries and jam and coolwhip and syrup.  Yum.  Amy's friends enjoy talking about bikini waxes, and eyebrow waxes, and who's dating who, and who's mad at who and blah blah blah. So you can imagine how well I fit in with the group. Oh well, my boy was there. We went swimming because there was finally summer weather. The pool was nice and warm (but not a bathtub). Amy's friends enjoy sunbathing and more blah blah blah and I got bored but still had fun (because of the swimming, waffles, and Adam). Amy made strawberry daquiries with too much rum and then barbecued hamburgers. Yum yum yum. And swam some more. Everyone pretty much left after that. We watched some Law and Order CI and some Crossing Jordan and some Sex shows and then went to bed.   Monday    Steph woke us up at 10 to 7 to use the washroom, then let us sleep to 8am (thank you Stephanie). Amy and I cleaned up our weekend mess because the parents were coming home at 12:30. Well, mostly Amy cleaned, I spent time in Steph's room watching a movie called  Digging to China  5.  Amy's parents came home at 12:30 on the dot (they are very punctual). Amy's Dad gave me an Oh Henry bar as a souvenir. It was well received since I hadn't had any breakie. Me and Amy watched some  Days of Our Lives  and then decided to go see a movie. Adam and Craig came too. We wanted to see  Catwoman , but apparently Showcase doesn't have matinees even though they advertise them in the paper (ahem). So we went to see  the Terminal  6  at Encore (Amy drove us in her Daddy's Jag). Then that was the end of Amy (I can only assume people cease to exist when I am not interacting with them). I went to hang out with Adam at his house and Craig made DVDs and we all watched Wonder Woman.   T H E E N D
