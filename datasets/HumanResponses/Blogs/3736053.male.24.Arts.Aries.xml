       Here i am. Finished my two days this week, sitting and drinking tea while it's about 35 degrees celsius outside. I'm sweating like a pig. This heat is amazing! The last time i experienced something similar was last year when i was studying spanish in Sevilla. In the end of may we had temperatures closer to 40 degrees, still a different heat though.  This weekend i want to do a lot of stuff...  I'm planning to work a little bit on that photojob i got, there are some people that want some 30 creative photos. So i'm brainstorming about situations or places where i can shoot thoose...  And i want to go out and party some tonight, for the first time in two weeks since i was working all weekend long last week. However, this weekend is short, on monday i work again, and it will be monday til friday...  Still not sure...  I wan't to do something else during the days, something more creative, but how does that and money go together, well... offer me a job within something creative and we have a solution.  Now: Siesta and food  Hasta luego.

       I'm tired, it's my sixth day working, not in a row but scattered on two seperate weeks. I was looking forward to finish my studies at Centro de Lenguas Modernas and i did, even with a good result. In the end it felt like something i just wanted to get overwith, to end something and begin something else, the time after the studies, find a job, intent to settle myself in this city, and just become sure that i don't have to leave when my studies finished...  And my plan worked, but still i miss a lot of things in my life, i still don't have the job of my dreams, but i'm still able to survive with the job i got right now. Another thing is that i would like to move to an apartment of my own. Something more personal, but i guess i'll have to wait.  I guess things come when i less expect them.   And i believe in surprises.

       Monday, job is done, and i'm dying of starvation and this heat. I was on my way to get some food but i though of writing down some words before i keep going on with my normal life.  This weekend was great, exactly what a weekend should be...  It began with Granadas gaypride, small in it's size, but with a lot of fun people. Later that afternoon i was DJ:ing, actually for the first time in almost 2 years, and hell, i realized i was missing that soo much!! Played some tunes for about an hour and i felt like a new person. A mixture between jazz, electronica and some beats.  The day was crazy though, a heat together with drinking for many many hours... and a lot of photos made. Went to bed quite early to get up in the morning, not that early, but to go to the beach... and hell... yesterday was an even hotter day, laying on the beach, under the sun, jumping into the mideterranian sea many times, drinking about 5 litres of water... and driving back between the mountainous passages of Sierra Nevada.  Today my body hurts a little bit, burned by the sun, but not so tired, i guess i'm begining to get used to all this working. Waking up early, the hours passes by really fast, and then Silvia, my friend takes over...  In my mind there are many things, thoughts of jobs, future plans... however... my life is liven day by day, i don't think about tomorrow and neither yesterday.  This is me, stereosampling.

       So this is what has happened. This saturday the owner of our falt came by with some people... saying: - we're goig to sell the flat. And since our contract officially ends now in July, even if we can unofficially live there for another 2 months until September 1:st, the situation is a little bit tricky. That is... it's difficult to find a flat in September, and even though i love Granada as the place i fell in love with about 2 years ago i feel that a change of atmosphere would be in it's place. Furthermore... finding a job here is difficult so, after throwing around some 100 CV's and being very very optimistic and happy towards the poeple iv'e met the only thing i have is the job in the hostel. Yes, of course, it keeps me alive but i'm looking for something more... with possibilities towards the future. I know you can't build a city in one day and neither a life in a different city, but with the background and experience i have in the world of creativity there should be more to find... or at least more response from... whoever who have seen my CV and my CD with all the stuff i've done the last years.   So the solution was... find another place in Granada and keep being optimistic about an unknown future... or move to another place.   And this whole thing about Barcelona isn't actually something new, it's a 3 months old thing that have been putting questionmarks in my head.  So... this thing with suddently having to leave the apartment, and choosing to do that at this point and not within 3 months... i feel it like a push forward. Like, take a chance, go there and see what the big city has to offer. And i do believe a lot in Barcelona, not only that it's bigger but also all the things this cosmopolitan city have to offer.   So... we've put the date to August 2nd... but it might change depending on the circumstances.   Me and my friend Roman will rent a car and then drive up along the coast with all our stuff, and as we see it, an old life will end and a new one will begin.  An adventure of some kind, something i'm looking forward to.  Before the weekend i was thinking of leaveing this job this week, but life might change very suddently, so, i'll stay until i go. I will miss the feeling of meeting new people every day, show them my favourite places on the map of Granada. But i have to get something done in my life, at least something inside me pushes me forward. And somehow i see myself over there, along the northeast coast of Spain, in Barcelona. Images created in my head, but with theese dreams and my optimism i will reach that.  Stereosampling.
