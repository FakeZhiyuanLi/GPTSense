        I apologize for not writing the past 4 days. We've been busy babysitting my in laws dog, horses, and fish. And for this lady (who is NOT an animal lover), it is quite a task. I was even given instructions to "pet and talk to the dog." Oh my.    We spent Friday in Seattle with Ben. It was a nice day. We went to the Experience Music Project, which we all thought was pretty awesome. My favorite part was probably the Elvis displays, I admit this Alabama girl is an Elvis fan. I'm not a fan of the life he led by any means, but I believe he was talented, charismatic, and deep down had a longing for God but had a very weak flesh. His life is a good reminder that fame, money, achievement, sex, and world acclaim will leave you just as empty as when you started. A man who had a very "full" life died an "empty" one. So sad.   Josh took Ben back to the airport on Saturday. We were all sad to see him go. Jacob insists that we adopt Ben and make him his "new" brother but considering he is my cousin and only 8 years younger than me, I think that would be hard to do.       Remember that disorder I was suffering from last week ( also known as PMS). Well, I failed to mention another disorder I am suffering from. I have suffered with this one most of our marriage but had thought I was in remmission. I've had a relapse (or two) lately and need to confess.     I call my disorder "NWS" or Nagging Wife Syndrome. It seems to lay dormant until I spot crumbs on the counter tops, pants beside the hamper, or socks in the bathroom floor. Then suddenly, I feel my disorder resurface and take over my body. I forget all about what a wonderful husband I have, how much he loves me, how much he loves our children, and I seem to suddenly forget about all the wonderful things he DOES DO. My memory is erased and suddenly all I recall is the garbage can that is overflowing or those pesky counter crumbs.   Dare I say this next part? When NWS kicks in to full blown disease, I sometimes even find myself slamming my kitchen cabinets a little harder, shoving bowls and glasses in them a little louder as if to say, " SEE ALL I DO AROUND HERE." I breathe and sigh out loud and think of my poor little self as nothing less than a martyr for my family.       AND THEN, God smacks me on the bottom and lovingly says, " WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU??" And as much as it hurts to be disciplined, I'm so glad He does it or else I would be one horribly rotten bratty kid of His.      So this week, I have been challenged over this NWS disorder. I realize there is no magic pill for me to take that will humble me or make me kinder to this wonderful man I married. BUT, there is a remedy I have found that does work.     I've been reading over the word of God and finding scriptures of what a woman with NWS really is like... I found one in Proverbs that says, " A nagging wife is a like constant drip." OOOOUCH! You know when your sink faucet just DRIPS, DRIPS, DRIPS, and it drives you absolutely insane??? That's what I am like to my husband when I get a NWS flareup. OOh, the poor guy. There is nothing more annoying than a constant drip.     God also reminded me that none of those stupid little things that I allow to get to me, are "character" issues. So what if he occasionally forgets to pick up his socks? Or his pants? Or wipe off the counter after he made a sandwich? Really and truly, if that is ALL I can find to complain about with my husband (and it is!), than I am one truly, truly, deeply blessed woman. And I AM!    My husband prays for me, prays over me, reads his bible every day, he always wakes up in a good mood and treats me kindly, he loves our children, he even helps change diapers for a 9 year old without complaint (that alone SHOULD SHUT ME UP!), he is full of integrity, he works hard, he is honest, gentle, and most of all, he looks past SOOOO many of my faults without ever making note of them (at least outloud! ha).    So, as I concentrate on all the things that DO matter, it seems I can feel my disorder begin to fade away like an old rash. I realize it's still there (and probably always will be), but whether or not it surfaces and takes over my whole body (and MOUTH), is really up to me.     So my prayer this week is to appreciate, love, respect, honor, and cherish this wonderful man I have. To be his cheerleader and not his critic, to encourage him not discourage him, and to be a bubbling spring.. NOT a constant DRIP.

         Since I won't be home all day tomorrow, I'll go ahead and share my weekly highlights now.    * I started a new cereal called Kashi that is full of fiber. If you like the taste of twigs and cardboard, you will love it.   I am just proud of myself for eating it 4 days this week.    * I successfully made it 2 days without any coke or Dr. Pepper once again.     * One day this week I did 200 sit ups. Forget the fact I could hardly walk the next day, I still did them. ha!   * I am experiencing a full blown disorder this week known throughout the US to modern day women as PMS. I have not murdered anyone in my home, I haven't eaten every bag of M&M's that the store sells, and I haven't punched a whole in any of the walls in my house. This was a good week. Somebody pass me the Midol.   * Right now, every ounce of laundry in my house is complete. *bows and says "thank you, thank you very much"*   * I get an entire day with my husband tomorrow without my kids, okay, Ben will be there today but nobody who will need their juice refilled or the bottom wiped. It will be a good day.   * I've spent time with the Lord every day this week despite the whole PMS disorder.    * I heard my husband preach one of the most powerful sermon's ever. I was so proud!   * Did I mention I haven't killed anyone? ha ha

         Imagine you find out that the President of the United States has decided he wants to come to your house for dinner tomorrow night. You receive a letter and a phone call saying he will arrive at 5 p.m. How will you prepare?    Imagine he arrives the next night as planned and you pull out leftovers from the night before. Cold spaghetti... you don't even warm it up. Oh, and the garlic bread was all eaten up the night before besides a few little scraps, so you offer him that as well. The dessert is completely gone but you manage to find a crushed up packaged Debbie cake at the bottom of your cabinet so you put that on his plate as well. You didn't have time to brew him any tea so you just give him tap water.      You place this meal in front of him, barely sit at the table and speak to him, say " hope this is good enough" and then walk away..     There's a reason I share this analogy. It's something God revealed to me last night.         So last night, my husband preached a very convicting sermon. He asked us point blank if we are giving God our left overs, our scraps, our crumbs, OR are we giving God our main meal and our First fruits?     In the Old Testement they would chose their best lamb as an offering to God. A lamb without blemish or defect, a lamb that I am sure they probably could've used but instead they decided God deserved their very best.     We know the story of Cain and Abel. Abel offered up his very best "fruits" to God. He picked the best and the first of all he had and he offered it to God out of his love and devotion to God.   Cain on the other hand, gave God his left overs. What was left after he set aside the best for himself.     So my husband's question to all of us last night was simple and yet very challenging.. What are you offering to God DAILY?    Do you give God the VERY best you have to offer? Are you offering up your first fruits in your life? Are you serving Him with your time? Are you faithfully tithing? Are you seeking Him through the bible daily? Are you spending that time in prayer for others?   Or... do you fit Him into your schedule when you can? Is God getting your left overs, your crumbs? While your job, your family, yourself, get's your best?     My husband spoke on a subject that is hard to hear ( I know my ears were in pain!). He talked about how we have been a "consumer" friendly society and that has even trickled over into our Christian walk. We are all about being served. What can a church do for me? What does a church have to offer? What kind of programs?    What does God have to offer me? what can He do to change my circumstance?     And thus our world, and even our Christian walk begins to revolve around US.. The whole " ME... ME.... BUT WHAT ABOUT ME?!?"     I have been far too guilty of that myself. I had to ask for forgiveness last night. God didn't create my life and form me in my mother's womb so that I could spend my life worrying about myself. It's really not about ME. It's about God.     So instead of offering Him my scraps, I am going to strive to offer God my best, my main meal, my firstfruits.    I am going to strive to make my daily living a sacrifice that is pleasing to God.

         After what I wrote yesterday, God must be testing me or something.       On the way to take Austin to physical therapy, our car died twice (cut out). Thankfully, I made it there and back but who knows what's wrong with that thing now. This is the 4th time this has happened in the last 3 months.      My advice to anyone and everyone is to avoid purchasing an American made vehicle or at least a Ford. We've had nothing but problems with this car and just about everyone we know that has one, has the same problems.      So I realize I have a choice here-- okay, I actually have TWO choices. I can either trust God and know He will work this "car" thing out for us, or I can whine, complain, stress out, and get sick over something that I can't change.     You would think it would be an easy choice but this stubborn daughter of God often choses the latter for reasons' unknown.           Another thought on all the whole "prayer and faith" issue. A few weeks back, Jacob said to me, " Mom I wish I had a real brother that could talk to me and play with me." Of course, he was referring to his 9 year old brother that has autism.      It broke my heart. I said to him, " well Jacob, we can just pray that Jesus will continue to help Austin do all those things."      This next part REALLY got me.. He said, " Mom, I do pray everytime but it's not working."      OUCH.. OOOhhh... Woeee...      How do you respond to that one? Especially when you understand completely how he feels. I too pray "everytime" and have yet to see the full answer of healing that I am seeking. And maybe I never will. God never did promise us that in this life we would have perfect health, cars that don't break down, or trials. Actually, Jesus was pretty honest about the reality that in THIS life we will face many hardships, trials, struggles, and temptation. He never sugar coated life on earth. But He did tell us that, " Take heart I have overcome this world." And He promised us a much better, happier, healthier place for the rest of eternity if we just stick it out on this earth and serve Him will doing that.       So... whether or not God heals my son, fixes my car, allows for that tummy tuck (ha!), or does any of the other numerous things I desire... He is still God. He is still good and He is still worthy of my praise.       My conclusion about the whole prayer issue is not profound but I think it's true:        Sometimes God answers our prayers, sometimes He doesn't (at least not the way we wish), and sometimes He has us cling to Him until He does act and answer.

       Do you ever pray so hard about something (or somethingS) and feel like God must be holding his ears or that your prayers hit the ceiling only to fall back down on the floor?    No? well, maybe I'm the only one.    This is where I honestly have been the past few days. There are a few things that I have been praying earnestly about for over a year and have yet to see ANY change (in the physical realm at least). And yet for the last three months, I have felt that God is doing SOMETHING behind the scenes to get this accomplished.. and yet I still can't tangibly see any difference.    It gets down right frustrating. And I just believe in being totally honest with God so I just told Him that. I came before a Holy God and the Creator of the Universe and told Him that I am frustrated, confused, and don't understand what He's doing.    I even told Him, " Why do you ask us to pray when you don't seem to answer?!?" It really wasn't so much of a question as it was a remark.    Thankfully God loves me enough to allow me to have my 3 year old temper tantrums. I might as well just throw myself in the floor and kick and scream. Actually, hold on a minute, while I try it. It might make me feel better..    Nevermind, I don't have the energy to do that AND pick myself back up.    So, I had this little "issue" today and hoped God would magically do something to open my eyes to see that He is answering my prayer over this issue. But nope, instead He did what He usually does.. He lovingly reminded of how faithful He has been to me and in His wisdom, brought back to memory all those prayers HE has answered.   I will share a few that He brought to mind:   1) A few Christmas's ago, we had no money for Christmas presents. I mean we were broke. I had been praying and asking God to work somehow and do something but felt pretty discouraged and assumed He was just teaching me to be content. ha! I went to the mailbox that day and received a letter. It had no return address. I opened it up and inside was a $500 money order. A note read, " This is from the Lord." NOW, I realize somebody had to have sent that but to this very day, we have no clue who it was and believe it came straight from God's heart.    2) Our couches were falling apart. I mean literally they were coming apart. There were strings hanging all over the place, rips, stains, etc.. We had bought them 10 years used when we married and after 2 kids and 5 more years, they were just gross. I lovingly referred to them as the "crack house" couches. They honestly looked like they could've come from there. ha ha.    The thought occurred to me last summer that I could PRAY for new couches. I mean, what would it hurt? So I wrote down in my journal and asked the Lord that if at all possible could he work a miracle for us and provide us with new couches.   A week later, a drunk driver ran through my in laws living room in his truck. He hit their couches but did no damage at all to them. Just because they were hit, the insurance company replaced them so my in laws gave us their couches that were only a few years old. They are nice and matched my colors perfectly. I knew it was straight from God.    3) Jacob was old enough to start preschool but we couldn't afford tuition. I never said a word to anyone about it but I did pray that God would provide a way. Jacob thrives in that type of environment and really needed that time away from mommy. A friend of mine from Alabama (now living in North Carolina) was talking with me one day and asked me if Jacob was in preschool yet. I simply said, " No, not yet." Then she said, " Well we would love to pay his tuition if you want to put him in one." Totally out of the blue. He began preschool this January and loved every minute of it. Another answered prayer straight from the heart of God.   4) This one is really awesome because it wasn't even a prayer, but more like a "thought." This one still boggles my mind.      I had bought some new walking pants for Christmas that I just loved. The only problem is that they were too long on the bottom. I wore them once and then put them away because I realized I was dragging them and getting them dirty. I thought, " God I wish I knew someone that could hem these for me."   That same week I was at church when an older woman from church, Glenda, came up to me and said (these were her exact words), " You know, I've been thinking about you a lot lately and praying for you. For some reason I just feel like I should ask you if there is anything you have that I could hem for you." I about fell on the ground. I told her the story and she was relieved because she was sure I would think that was a strange request.    She took my pants, hemmed them up, and they fit me perfectly now.    God didn't even need me to verbalize that one, He heard my thoughts.    " Your heavenly Father knows what you need before you even ask."     After thinking of all the many requests God has answered in my life, even the small ones like new couches and hemmed pants, it left me with the absolute assurance that GOD DOES HEAR ME. But most importantly, that He knows exactly what I need,when I need it, and how it needs to be done.     So maybe this waiting on Him is actually teaching me to trust in His wisdom instead of question His character.     *wipes forehead*, Man, this growing up thing is so hard! :)

        I read this today... and wow, did it ever speak to me.     This is about brokeness before God. I was thinking about how I often I pray for the Lord to give me strength, not that asking for strength is a bad thing. But I can't recall a time I prayed to God for brokeness. So maybe I should be praying for strength a little less and brokeness a little more. Strength seems more acceptable and comfortable... brokeness seems a bit more uncertain and uncomfortable. But maybe that's exactly what I need to mold my heart to please God.     This just made me think...    Are You Perfectly Broken? "When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves." Job 41:25 God uses most for His glory those people and things which are most perfectly broken.  The sacrifices He accepts are broken and contrite hearts.  it was the breaking down of Jacob's natural strength at Peniel that got him where God could clothe him with spiritual power.  It was breaking the surface of the rock at Horeb, by the stroke of Moses' rod, that let out the cool waters to thirsty people.  ....It was when Jesus took the five loaves and broke them, that the bread was multiplied in the very act of breaking, sufficient to feed five thousand.  It was when Mary broke her beautiful alabaster box, rendering it henceforth useless, that the pent-up perfume filled the house.  It was when Jesus allowed His precious body to be broken to pieces by thorns and nails and spear, that His inner life was poured out, like a crystal ocean, for thirsty sinners to drink and live.  It is when a beautiful grain of corn is broken up in the earth by death, that its inner heart sprouts forth and bears hundreds of other grains.  And thus, on and on, through all history, and all biography, and all vegetation, and all spiritual life, God must have broken things.  Those who are broken in wealth, and broken in self-will, and broken in their ambitions, and broken in their beautiful ideals, and broken in worldly reputation, and broken in their affections, and broken ofttimes in health; those who are despised and seem utterly forlorn and helpless, the Holy Ghost is seizing upon, and using for God's glory.  "The lame take the prey," Isaiah tells us.

        At the demand of my Aunt Beth, I decided to write in here today. ha ha! I have to give her something to read while she's at work. *snicker*    Yesterday was Father's Day and we had a nice day. I called my dad and talked to him briefly. He opened up his gifts while I sat on the phone with him. Times like that make me miss being so close to my family!   It was nice and sunny (and HOT, 90 plus degrees). We had a good church service yesterday. We had students from Northwest College come witht their band to lead our worship. They rocked the house. Ben looked at me and said, " wow, I wish we had a cool church like this in Alabama." It made me smile and feel grateful to be a part of such a wonderful church!    We went and spent the day at Josh's grandparents' with all of his family. We had lunch- at which Ben commented on how different (actually he said WEIRD, ha) our food is up here. We make lots of salads here, in the south "salad" means a green salad with lettuce. Up here salad can be anything.. pasta salad, fruit salad, bean salad, etc.. We ate a full meal and then had a big water fight outside. There were water balloons, water guns, and some people got down right dirty (AHEM.. JOSH!) and pulled out a hose. The nerve of some people!    Jacob threw a water balloon at me but it failed to pop, so I threw it back at him and he cried out, " Your my mommy, I can't believe you did that to me on purpose!" He was heart broken that a mother could do such a thing. I figured I was teaching him a good lesson about life.. you can't trust anybody. ha!    Later on we came back home, called our Pop to wish him a Happy Father's day and then went over to the in laws to eat ice cream. They had 5 different flavors ( to which Ben had all of them-ha), and then sat outside as the boys' jumped around in their little pool with all their clothes (and shoes on). We sat back and laughed and watched. I figured it was something they would always remember... the day mommy and daddy let us swim in full body clothing and tennis shoes. Their shoes are still soaked!     It was a great day. I reminder of the blessings of our dad's, what they mean to us, all they've taught us.. but most of all a reminder of our true Dad, and how He always loves us and is always good to us even (and especially) through the difficult times.        Today is my husband's birthday. He turns 30 (shhh... it's a secret), we actually have to be at a church dinner tonight at the Olive Garden so we won't officially celebrate until tomorrow. If it were up to Josh, we'd just put this day off completely. ha!     I did wake up early to bake him some blueberry muffins and iron his clothes before work. He's always so good at spoiling me, I figure he deserves it on his birthday.           Well, I'll update you on Josh's big day tomorrow. I'm headed outside to sit in the sun and let the boys' swim again only this time in a bathing suit!.

         I realize it's been 3 days since I've written in this blog. I apologize. We've been busy and I haven't had any quiet time to think and sit at this computer.      Yesterday we made a trip to Mt. St. Helen's with Ben (and our boys). It takes a little over an hour to get there- the drive is beautiful and amazing.       Ben was in awe of the mountains, especially Mt. St. Helen's. We drove right up to the base of it and were able to tour that visiting center. We watched a movie in there about the erruption and then walked around a bit. It was very warm outside but she was still covered in snow. It's really amazing to see God's handiwork up close and personal like that.     I was sitting there looking at the mountain wondering how anyone could look at something so awesome and not believe that there is a Creator. It just makes no sense without God in the equation.     Later on last night, Tyrone and Amy (our youth pastor), came over again for our movie night. We watched the Lord of the Rings 2 towers. Which means only one left and I have viewed them all. I think the second one was even better than the first. I can't wait to see the next one but I have to wait until they return from Mexico (missions trip).           Today I went out alone and did a little birthday shopping for my husband. He will be 30 years old (OUCH!) on Monday. The weirdest part of it is that I can remember when my parent's turned 30 and it doesn't seem that long ago.      Right now Josh and Ben are out with a bunch of guys from church playing paintball. They were all dressed in camo, they had on their masks, their guns were loaded, and they were ready for " all out war."      Men are funny.        I have been sneaking in (does that sound bad?) my time with the Lord but it hasn't been as consistent as it usually is. It's harder to do with company around and both the kids home from school. But I still relish the time I do have with Him.      I realize He is always with me and I continually talk with God throughout my day, but I'm talking about the time where I can just sit in His presence, enjoy His company, and stay a while. Those are the moments that feed my spirit and change my heart. And the Lord knows, it needs changin'!      *sigh* I just told Him today that I really am grateful for His grace and patience. I see so much about myself that isn't up to par, I am painfully aware of my "flesh and sin nature" and I pray that one day, this "dying" to it, will be easier for me. I haven't been feeling very successful with that lately, especially where my attitude is concerned. But, I know God is patient, loving, and merciful. Thankfully He is or else He would've given up on me a looong time ago.       So thank you God for loving me despite myself. Than you for knowing my heart and still loving me to the core of my being.        You truly are an awesome God.

        Today's entry will have to be fairly short considering I have to be at church in 20 minutes!      Today was our first "official" beginning day of summer break for Austin. I was hoping he'd sleep in, but he was still up at regular time.    For the first time since Ben arrived, I made it on the treadmill. I'm trying to stay disciplined and do 3 miles a day but today I only managed 2 and a half.    It's awfully warm here....I think it's around 85 out. We made a quick trip to Wal- Mart to buy a box so I could mail my dad's Father's Day present today. I got that mailed off and hopefully it will get to Alabama in time. I was tempted to see if I could fit one (or both) of my kids' into the box and mail them as well.    I love these little people that I care for but some days, I just about slobber from imagining a day of QUIET. A day with no diapers (and let me tell ya, a 9 year old in diapers is quite different than a 1 year old, ha), no juice cups being filled, no fights to break up, no physical therapy sessions to attend, etc.. BUT at the same time, those are the things that come along with these very precious little people that I love dearly. I am sure a day may come when quiet enters my home and I'll be longing for all these things to return. So I try to remind myself that contentment is a beautiful (and Godly) thing.    I spent an hour at Austin's physical therapy session today. I was pretty proud of how hard he worked (so was sweet Elsa, his therapist). He stringed some beads ( he used to scream the entire time as if he were being murdered), he put some puzzles together, he matched shapes, and named all of his color's correctly. The sweetest part was that he said, " I am nice" very clearly. Not sure why he said that except for maybe all the times he was accused of NOT being nice by his brother... it was a chance for him to defend his character in the presence of many witnesses I suppose. ha!      Well, my sweet husband is preaching to the adult's tonight in the service. I am always excited to hear what God has to say through Him.. let's just hope it's not about "wives being submissive" or such things. :)   I better go- I have 4 little feet that need socks and shoes placed on them before I can pack them up and get them to church on time.    If you stop by, leave me a comment so I know you are reading and there.     Thanks!

         Today will be eventful. It is Austin's last day of school for the year. He is already in "mourning." He says, " No school?" and then puts his face into his hands and cries. I think he will be a wonderful soap opera star one day. :)      My days will be quite different having both the kiddos home through the summer. This may very well be the time that I need medication for sedation, or better yet, that my children need medication for sedation. Is that illegal? ha.         We woke up to beautiful sunshine and blue skies today. I think Benji was beginning to wonder if the sun did shine on this side of the U.S. It's supposed to warm up to about 78 today and then hit over 80 the rest of the week. Ben is freezing while the rest of us are melting!    Josh just took Ben with him to a lunch for pastor's in the area. All the local pastor's from all denominations get together once a month for prayer, encouragement, and a meal. It's as it should be. They leave their differences at the door and come together to share what they all have in common... a love for God and a desire to see the lost saved. I hope Ben leaves as encouraged as Josh does each time.    Tonight I will be at a dinner for all of our Pastor's wives from church as a farewell to our senior pator's wife, Jodi. Their last day at our church is next week and I think I am still in denial. Jodi has been my mentor and my "spiritual mother" for these past 3 and a half years. I've never known a person who displays Christ consistently in their life like Jodi does. Saying goodbye to her is going to be sooooo hard. She will still be my mentor, only from a distance, but I will forever cherish all the numerous ways she invested into my life and my own ministry.     She has taught me the principle of sowing and reaping. She has lived her life sowing into the things of God... loving people, praying for people, discipling people, sacrificing FOR people, and giving to people in so many ways. I honestly don't think I know anyone who is more giving. She is the "gift givingest" (is that a word? hee) person I have ever known. She gives tangibly and spiritually.     I have seen up close and personal what it means to "minister." It's not about standing up in a pulpit and preaching. It's not about being called "Pastor" or being recognized. It's not about how large (or small) your church is.. it really is about the tears you cry over other's burdens, the sleepless nights praying for other's, the hospital visits at 1 a.m., sitting with someone as they weep at the altar, forgiving someone that has hurt you so deeply when all you have done is love and given.     Jesus summed it up best ( He has a way of doing that!), " I did not come to be served but I came to serve."     So if you desire to be important, to matter, to be a leader.. than you must be willing to be a servant first and foremost.     Jesus displayed it when He came to lowly earth, lived as a human man for 33 years although He was God. Dying the death of a criminal for sinful man (for me!).   Jodi has displayed it as well. I long to be that kind of leader and minister.     So when I grow up, I want to be just like Jesus and Jodi! :)

       I seriously just wrote about two paragraphs and then accidentally hit delete. My thoughts today are so deep that the computer can not contain them. ha ha!     Benji made it in from Alabama and we are having a good time. All of our friends' and church member's are relishing every moment of his "Southern" accent, including all the " Yes sir's, and no maam's." And without a doubt, a few of our youth girls' are already quite "smitten." On cue several walked up and talked to me yesterday who I haven't spoken to in a year, heck, a few of them I didn't even know. ha ha! Don't worry Aunt Pat, I won't send him home engaged or anything. *snicker*   We had a great church service yesterday. I was glad Ben was here to hear it. He's at that "stage" in life where he is suddenly having to become an adult. Our pastor even specifically mentioned the age when you have to decide what God wants you to do with your future and your life. Ben is at that point.    I remember when I was 18 years old, enrolled in Jr. College, working at McDonald's (the perks were great though, all the Big Mac's a heart could desire), and trying to parent a 2 year old without a father to help.. I was in college to be a teacher when suddenly it occurred to me that I had not sought after God as to what He desired for my future.     I spent the next few months seeking Him in prayer and His word. Asking for some direction for my future. In the middle of the night, in a dead sleep, God woke me up in my bedroom in Alabama and spoke as clearly as anyone has ever spoke to me.. He said, " You will be in ministry." No specifics.. no when's or how's, just simply, " this is what you will do."    I knew without a doubt from that moment on that this was my purpose and God's plan for my life. There is just something so comforting about KNOWING what God's very specifically designed and original plan for one's life is. No amount of money, status, power can even come close to comparing to that assurance.    So when days' get tough and I have all those questions in my head without answers, I find real peace and comfort in remaining in God's will.    THIS is exactly where He wants me to be, THIS is exactly what will draw me deeper and closer to Him, THIS is what is necessary to grow me up and mature me, THIS is God's plan for my life.    " For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope and a future."        Jeremiah 29:11   So thank you Lord, for having a plan for my life. Nothing is in vein as long as I hand it over to you and allow you to do your work.     You are the potter... I am the clay.

       Food for thought, something I read a few days ago and am still digesting. What do you think?     David Whidden, is a Southern Baptist currently on a service of study in a Bendectine monastery and blogging about his thoughts while there. This one is worth our consideration:   Much of our attitudes and beliefs about the church may be more of a function of where we live than of actual theological doctrine. One of the blessings of America is the wide latitude of personal belief and behavior that one is allowed – the focus of much of our culture is on the individual. It can be argued that this strong individualism is very much the source of America’s strength. However, one must wonder how well this level of intense individualism works in the church.  Today I’d like to spell out what I see as the problems that exist in our churches now. First, religious commitment tends to be viewed as something that is for the benefit of the individual. So we see people who constantly are moving from one church to another because they “aren’t being fed” spiritually at their present church, or because they do not like the pastor, or because someone has said something mean to them. The religious experience for these people is all about them, the commitment is not to something greater than them, but only to their own needs. This spiritual narcissism leads to a kind of spiritual commercialism that is best summarized in people talking about how they “are shopping for a church home.” . . . I would argue that for most of us, the real issue is one of accountability. It is much easier to be committed to oneself than to a community that might hold us accountable for what we do and what we believe. By practicing a set of spiritual practices that satisfy only our own needs, we end up avoiding the sheer messiness of having to deal with other people, and we end up avoiding practices that challenge us to grow and/or change our behavior. Likewise, when we only have to be accountable to ourselves, the human mind is quite capable of justifying any number of things that we might not be able to get away with in a religious community. Much of this idea about being spiritual seems to have to do with finding something that makes us feel good rather than something that transforms our lives. It becomes a quest for a spiritual Disneyland, where everything is perfect. But is religious experience only about feeling good? . . . [T]he cultural individualism in which we swim creates serious issues with authority. Anyone who knows me knows that this is my weakness. No human community of more than about three people can exist for long without resolving issues of power and authority. Authority structures are visible throughout nature, not just in human life – even chickens have authority structures, thus the genesis of the term “pecking order.” Yet most of us are only comfortable with authority when we are the ones wielding it; it is as if somehow we think humans are exempt from the need for authority. In our culture we rarely care to be subject to authority or to anyone telling us what we should or should not be doing. Because almost all Christian denominations have worked out authority structures, many people withdraw from the church rather than be subject to the church’s authority, though often using some other excuse. Or, sometimes even more destructively, individuals take their authority issues out on the church leadership by undermining or harassing the pastor.

         I sit here at 10 p.m. as my dear husband is at the Portland airport. Ben's plane is an hour late and thankfully, I decided against going with the both the kiddos because of how late it would be.    Tonight while running to the front door, my ankle twisted and now I have a sprained ankle. It is blue, purple, and swollen. It's also aching! So hopefully, tomorrow it will be much better, or else this woman will be riding piggy back for a few days.     I am off to bed to read and pray. I haven't talked to God as much as I should've today, so thankfully, He's still up.

        I can't believe I have actually managed to make it on here to write in this blog thingy today.    I was up laaate last night with our youth pastor, Tyrone, and his wife, Amy. I have been sucked in by peer pressure and influenced into watching the "Lord of the Rings" movies by my husband and our dear friends.   I thought I was strong enough to resist but the honest truth is, I really am weak.    Okay, well the HONEST truth is, I told my husband I would watch these movies if he would allow me to get snacks, so I was prompted by food. We had peanut m & M's, twizzlers, crackers with cheese, chips and salsa, and peanuts. A very nutritious snack night.    I actually liked it (we only watched the first one). I was thoroughly and completely lost the first 2 and a half hours but by the last 45 minutes I was catching on. Apparently there is a master ring that controls things, bad folks are after it so the good folks are running. Very intense premise. ha ha!   I went to bed at 1 a.m. wondering how in the world this movie will end. Then of course, I had dreams all night about elves and such... for some reason I was on the "bad team." Wonder what that means????    Anyway, I woke up and have been cleaning my house upside and down ever since. The toilet is clean, the tub has been scrubbed, the floors have been swept, mopped, and vacuumed. THe dishes and laundry are done (minus the ones we are wearing right now).     What event has required all this work from this poor Cinderella? Ben arrives in a few hours (as if an 18 year old boy cares about how clean a house is!), and tomorrow night we are having a big barbecue for people at church.     So I did all the cleaning so that as soon as everyone leaves tomorrow night, I can do it all over again.    *sigh* The work of a woman is never done. ha!   There is my day... give and take breaking up a few fights between my kids (which just so happen to be upstairs right now wreacking havoc and killing one another).   I better go and assess the damages.   Have a good weekend!

        Yes, I am writing twice in the same day. I had to come share my sad Wal-Mart experience with you all.   I've been waiting for the new Coke to come out (half the carbs, half the calories, etc.). It's called C2. Well, I tried to today, let's just say I will be sticking to the "real thing." It wasn't quite as bad as Diet but it sure wasn't as good as the high sugar, high carb, coke that I am ever so fond of.   My conclusion is that I would rather run another mile on the treadmill than drink a less than great version of my sweet coca cola.   The interesting thing about it is that God applied this to me in a spiritual form today.   In my bible study group (hello my sweet ladies!), this week's lesson is on our "saltiness." Jesus said in Luke 14 that if we lose our "saltiness" we are useless to Him.      So, I have been pondering and digesting that. By our "saltiness" Jesus is talking about our character, our witness... the depths of who we are (especially when nobody is looking).     Is my saltiness effective? Can people sense the flavor of God through the way I live my life? OR do they say no real difference between my life and theirs?    This sums it up... George Truett said, " You are either being corrupted by the world OR you are salting it."      It is either one way or the other. Either I am living seperate from this world, or I am compromising and tolerating it by how I live my life.     So when people look at me, I want them to sense the REAL thing.. not an off brand attempt to recreate Christ and who He was. I want them to see HIM, HIS CHARACTER, OBEDIENCE, LOVE, DEDICATION.     Because just like that Coke C2 I tasted today, you can't "fake" the real thing. It's obvious when you've replaced the flavor with something far less admirable.

          Well I will attempt to write in this every day but I highly doubt I can accomplish that. We shall see!     So far today is good. I got Austin off to school (only three more school days and he's out for the summer), I then attempted to crawl back into bed until Jacob woke up but I couldn't fall back to sleep.     So I did my time on the almighty treadmill while watching the rest of President Reagan's funeral ( never seen a week long funeral before).      Today will lead me to Wal-Mart (my husband thinks most days lead me to Wal Mart, ha), then back home to do some house cleaning.      I am preparing for my cousin, Ben, to arrive from Alabama tomorrow night. Pray for him, he has never flown before. And pray for him, I doubt he's spent 2 weeks with a 9 year old with autism, and a 4 year old who has no idea what "quiet" means. :)       For the next 2 weeks, I will be outnumbered 4 to 1 (males to female). I am however, convinced that I have enough estrogen to outweigh all the testosterone that will be under one roof! I am WOMAN..      I will try each Friday to make "highlights" of my week. Realize that as a stay at home mom, some weeks, my highlight may be the fact that I only changed 5 poop diapers instead of 7. Rejoice with me nonetheless!          Highlights this week:  * I went one whole day without a single Coke or Dr. Pepper. I was pretty proud. My addiction sometimes overwhelms me.    * I can't think of a time this week that I screamed at my kids', (Josh if you read this and CAN think of a time, just remember to have grace)!   * I had a nice, long talk on the phone with my dad. I treasure those times with him because I realize how fragile life is!    * I heard something very specific from the Lord this week as I was seeking Him.     Well, that wraps up this week in a nutshell.     Wal-mart HERE I COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

         Off and on throughout my day, I've seen bits and pieces of President Reagan's funeral. I have watched a few of the bio's that have been presented on tv about him, his life, his accomplishments, his disease, etc.. I have been inspired.      So many things about him inspire me; his love for his wife is just amazing. You can see the glimmer and spark between them when you watch older vidoes. I notice in each video they have of him near her, he is touching her- whether it be around her waste, holding her hand, his hands on her shoulders, etc. I think it's wonderful that even as the President of the United States, he was not afraid to show the world that he was in total love with his wife!      That has inspired me to be a better wife, partner, friend, and helper to my own spouse. So my goal this week has been to bless Josh's socks off (not literally since I know they'd be laying around the floor and not in the hamper, ha). To go out of my way to make him feel absolutely loved, appreciated, and adored. I think he believes my hormones have gone haywire or that I've eaten waaay too much chocolate (which both are likely true), but regardless, I can tell he is enjoying this!       I've also been inspired by Mr. Reagan to keep a good sense of humor in all situations. He seemed to know when it was time to tell a good joke or even humor people with sarcasm. Humor really is a gift and it sure can make this load feel easier to carry.      I most likely will never be the President of the United States ( I'll leave that one to George W.- who is doing a fantastic job by the way), but I can equally influence the people in my sphere and realm of life. I can encourage, support, love and effect those that God has placed in my path in an equally important way if I chose to do so. And I am trying my best to make a conscience choice to do so each day... starting with my Lord Jesus, and knowing if I can master loving him completely, it will dribble over into all the other's around me.      So thank you President Reagan for leaving a lasting, honorable legacy of a man of integrity, great character, and most of all, a love for God.       I must admit however, I'm a bit jealous that a man that has been dead for 5 days has traveled more than I have.. But he deserves it. :)

         Okay, I think I've figured this thing out! It makes me wonder why I didn't just buy a diary and a regular ink pen, and start from there. ha!    So why am I doing this blog?? Well, one of my greatest influences in life, an old youth pastor, shared his blog with me. He started one last year and asks his entire church congregation to read it when possible. He shares his thoughts, his concerns, his heart, and most of all, what God is doing in his life.    I figured it was a great oppurtunity to show people transparency during my own Christian and life walk.    I hope you enjoy sharing in my journey that I like to call, " life." ha ha!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not a "morning person." And when I say "morning, " I'm talking around... um... let's say 7' ish so imagine waking up at 2:15 a.m. !?!?!?! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, here I am.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In one hour I am leaving for the airport with Austin (who luckily is still sound asleep!) to fly back to Alabama. I won't be writing while I am gone so please forgive me. Read a book, a newspaper, or something else in my absence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue praying for my mom (and my dad!). My dad's health is very poor and my mom is still dealing with this "colon" issue. We won't know a whole lot else about her condition until they go in to her colon sometime this week.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be there to help take care of them both and am leaving behind my husband and Jacob.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray for my flight if you are reading this today. It's going to be a loooooong day for me and Austin.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will update you as soon as I return.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just say, this past week has brought about the most amazing blessings and at the same time, some of the most difficult circumstances in my life. I have had very high high's, and very low low's.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have concluded that when satan does his best to discourage you, God will do His best (which is always much better than satan's) to encourage you.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen both forces at hand in my life this week. I have NEVER in all my years serving God been more blessed tangibly by God than I have the last 6 days. I will share it all eventually but not today..  &nbsp;&nbsp; Today I just want to share my strawberry pie story.   &nbsp; We have a neighbor, Ted (or I&nbsp;like to call him Grizzly Adam's, ha), who my husband has been trying to reach out to. He is not a Christian. As a matter of fact, our first meeting with Ted last summer included him being drunk and threatening to kill us. BUT, when he sobers up, he is a very nice man that just needs Jesus.   &nbsp;&nbsp; So over the last few months, we have been trying to establish a friendship with him and get him to church.   &nbsp;&nbsp; The last few weeks, I have felt very strongly that God wanted me to make a strawberry pie for Ted. God constantly brought the thought to mind. I kept telling God, " but I've never made a strawberry pie before, what if it doesn't taste good?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; I think God got tired of my excuses so He opened a door.  &nbsp;&nbsp; I had a dinner planned with our worship pastor for a while now. She emailed me on Tuesday and said, " After dinner on Thursday, I thought it would be fun to make strawberry pies together."&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp; So I spent last night with the "pie Queen" making a pie for Ted. It sat in my fridge overnight to cool off and this afternoon, Josh will walk it over to Mr. Ted.   &nbsp;&nbsp; I realize this may not be a huge deal but God just confirmed to me that if HE calls you or asks you to do something, He will provide the way for you to do it.   &nbsp;&nbsp; If God calls you, He equips you. Even if it's a strawberry pie.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 6 weeks ago, while I was praying, the Lord told me that I was about to go through some difficult and painful times. God is definitely not a liar but I am so thankful that He loves me enough to prepare me.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I am going through the storm of my life right now but regardless, I know God will see us through this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I have learned about storms (growing up in the Southeast teaches a lot about storms), is that although they are dark, scarey, and can seem overwhelming... they will pass.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God has continually given me these verses in Isaiah: &nbsp; &nbsp; " Fear not, for I have redeemed you, I have summoned you by name, you are mine. When you walk through the water I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you, when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you ablaze. For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Isreal, your Savior."  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you pray with a sincere heart that God will grow you and give you a deeper love for Him, don't be surprised when trials, hardships, and suffering come your way. Because this is how I will grow and this is what will cause me to grow deeper in my love for God. And it's worth it.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard this a while back and this has become my life's purpose statement: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; " To obey is my objective... to suffer is to be expected. His Glory is my reward."

She is hemorraging from her colon. They need to do a colonoscopy but have to wait because her blood is so thin and her blood pressure is too low.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray for God to touch and heal her, encourage her, and show Himself ever faithful through this trial.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week seems to have brought about many highlights! &nbsp; &nbsp; * VBS and Music Camp&nbsp;are over with! It was successful, we survived, and now it's finished.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; * Martha Stewart was "sentenced" today. Once again, my conclusion is that if you have enough money, you can buy an "out of jail" ticket fairly easily. Case and Point: OJ Simpson. &nbsp; &nbsp;* Austin is now swimming without his life jacket. This kid is part fish.. I am convinced.  &nbsp; &nbsp;* Another "lady" hit on my husband this week, the interesting thing is that it was RIGHT in my home. She asks me, " Do you think Josh still loves you?" I replied, " Yes!" and she said, " ooooh.. because I think he's pretty cute."&nbsp; Nevermind the fact she is 6 years old! :) &nbsp; &nbsp;* I drank Green tea 3 days in a row. Apparently it "cures" any ailment you are suffering; dimentia, cancer, headaches, depression, and of course "Nagging Wife Syndrome." &nbsp; &nbsp;* I found out that&nbsp;it is true. Splenda does indeed cause " gastrointestinal distress." &nbsp;Nuff' said. &nbsp; &nbsp;* God is faithful.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another week has come and gone. It's already mid July-which means, only 6 more weeks until my kids' start school. Hats off to ALL homeschooling mom's out there. I could do it too but I would need the biggest box of Paxil the doctor could find.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a great weekend!  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in light of my recent "blah's" experience, I have decided to laugh as much as possible today.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best way to do that is to watch stupid movies that are absolutely ridiculous but still make you laugh hysterically, read dumb jokes, or better yet, watch someone else fall&nbsp;trip and then watch them pretend like they didn't.&nbsp; For some reason, I think that one of the funniest things ever in life is when people trip or fall down. Is it mean? probably, but nonetheless, I am always amused by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today at church I watched someone trip, look around to make sure nobody saw (not realizing I did), and then walk on as if it never happened. I laughed for about 10 minutes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also caught the tail end of one of the stupidest movies, " Zoolander."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My favorite line (now thanks to my cousin Ben) is: " Do you ever wonder if there is more to life than just being really, really, really, really good looking?"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Such deep thoughts. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then, of course, always reading Jack Handy's deep thoughts make me bust a gutt.  &nbsp; &nbsp; Here are a few of my all time favorites: &nbsp; &nbsp; " It takes a big man to cry.... it takes a bigger man to laugh at that man. "  &nbsp; &nbsp; " Before you judge someone... walk a mile in their shoes. Then you'll be a mile away from them, AND you'll have their shoes."  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; " Consider the daffodil, and I'll be over here looking through your things."  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; " The face of a child can say a lot.... especially the mouth part."  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, have you had enough? Quite possibly you have to be blonde and from Alabama to enjoy these thoroughly.. I'm not sure.  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; But either way. Today God gave me many laughs just when I need them. He has to be a&nbsp;humorous God. Look at some of His creatures (especially a few that I'm related to-ha).  &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Laughing has been good for my soul today!  &nbsp; &nbsp; stay tuned for tomorrow's weekly highlights if you dare!  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Is there such a thing as being too transparent? Possibly. We are about to find out. ha!    So I've been a little "down" lately. I don't know. For about a month now I've been battling the "blah's." Typically it's nothing chocolate can't fix or a good time in the bible with the Lord won't remedy, but lately, even those two common relief's haven't been working.     I don't like it when "grown up's" whine and act like babies so I will spare you the drama but this is something that is hard to describe.    I don't think I am typically a "depressed" person. I have gone through real depression only once in my life and it was when life brought about a lot of changes. God brought me out of it with time and His goodness but it sure isn't anything I ever want to endure again.    Like I said, I can't explain it. It's not as if anything disastrous has happened to me but just general "life" disappointments and some stress that has been building up over time I suppose. I'm not sure.     I wouldn't say I am in "depression" per say, more like I am in a "funk." Regardless... anytime God puts me in  uncomfortable, painful situations and circumstances, He uses it to prune away some unfruitful things in my life and heart. It's possible I am just going through the pruning process right now and since He's not finished working, I can't see the end result.. which I am sure will be a good thing.     So hopefully He will continue (but quickly Please God) with his pruning shears in my life and then He'll take a few steps back... admire HIS work and say.. " yes.. this is good."      And I'll wipe my forehead and say, " Shew..thank you Lord but glad that's over with."  :)

        So much to write and yet, so little time!   We spent last Friday in Tacoma at Chuck E Cheese's. Ya know, you really THINK you have matured and become a grown up, then you go into a place like that and you find yourself just as excited as the 8 year old's. Okay, at least I do anyway. :) Hey, and the food ain't too bad either.   The boys' had a lot of fun. We did have one incident where a lady came up to me, pointed at Austin and said, " Is he mute or just handicapped?" Josh and I laughed about it later and said we should've said, " what? you mean something is wrong with him?" It wasn't that she was asking about him, that doesn't bother me at all (actually I welcome it!), but it was the way she asked. Maybe you had to hear it... I don't know. I am often amazed at the rudeness of people but I'm sure it's just God's way of teaching me grace!!    Later on that night we went to Josh's softball game (church team) and Austin had a freak out. I'm still not sure what set him off unless it was the sound of balls hitting the bat (kind of that Pop sound), but I had to turn around and bring him home. He's had a few other moments like that since so keep him in your prayers (and ME too.. hee).  It seems like every summer we endure this and of course, it's always after the 4th of July. I think it puts him on "guard" and protective mode.. as if he's just anticipating it or something.       This week is VBS at church so I doubt I'll be able to write much. Bear with me. I'm sure after a week with 60 3 & 4 year old's, I'll have many stories to share!      Today, I took Jacob out to the in laws pool to swim. I was attacked (yes.. ATTACKED) by a yellow jacket. It's as if I stepped on his mother years ago and he lye in wait for me. The thing literally CHASED after me- I can only imagine the sight passer by's got seeing this blonde woman waving her arms around, running, and screaming. hee. Anyway, Jacob stood by horrified screaming for me and finally it got me. The thing got right inside my ear and left his stinger. I think I forgot how badly those things hurt. I had a flash back to being 9 years old in Alabama. I wanted my mommy.. there, I said it and I'm not ashamed.    It's swollen and it bled a little but I think I will survive the attack of the angry yellow jacket. The only comfort I received is knowing that after that sucker planted that thing in my ear, it quickly died. So I conclude that he was the ultimate loser. And after such violence, I doubt he made it into insect heaven!    Well, it's almost time to start cooking dinner so off I go. B;L.T's here I come!

         Well, having two kids home all day makes my life sing to a different tune! So I am realizing there is no way for me to update this every day (unless someone out there wants to adopt two boys', ha), so I will attempt to write at least every other or every 2 days!         I have to give a quick praise before I begin my usual "rant." ha!    Austin has been talking up a storm lately- making sentences like never before. So yesterday, he was playing with Jacob and they got into an argument (surprise, surprise!), and Austin says, " You stop it right now! GOT IT?!" It was so funny considering that is my LINE to my kids. Makes you realize they really do listen to you afterall. ha! But Austin was talking so much yesterday that Jacob said, " MOM, would you please make him be quiet?" I realize to most of you this is not a big deal, but it made me cry. I remember BEGGING God to give Austin just ONE word, but never in all my wildest dreams did I imagine he would talk so much he would annoy people. ha! I, then of course told Jacob, " Nope Jacob, remember how we prayed hard that Austin would talk? Well, mommy isn't going to shut him up now!"  So then Jacob says, " well mom, could you at least make him talk in the other room?" ha!      He still has far to go but God is really doing an amazing work here in this child's life. What a blessing!!     We also survived the 4th of July. Austin did great ALL day long despite the fireworks but towards 10 p.m. people were shooting them in all directions around our house. It was almost scaring me! ha! He got upset for about 15 minutes crying and saying he was scared, so I just took him into his bed, turned on every fan in our house, played some praise music, and rubbed his back until he fell asleep. It was much more tolerable than the years before so a HUGE thank you to everyone that said a prayer for him. :)      Other than that, I am just in several situations right now in my life that are requiring me to trust in the Lord. We had been promised something 4 months ago that would've changed our circumstances tremendously and 2 days ago, that promise was broken. There are a few other life altering situations going on in my sphere of reality right now that I have absolutely NO control over. These aren't little "broken nail" issues either. I have NO idea how any of these things are going to turn out or what our lives will be in 6 months from now.     This morning as I lye in bed (trying hard to go back to sleep), I felt the Lord tell me that this place I am at right now in my life is a beautiful, sweet, and precious place to be. I have no options or alternatives right now but to trust the Lord. I don't have the slightest idea what the future holds but I know the one that holds my future. And that same promise He made to me years ago came back to mind.. " I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord."      I really just have to take comfort that God knows already what will become of all these situations, how He will walk us through them, and where He will lead us.     Right now, I am learning to have Jesus be ENOUGH for me. Not knowing can drive me insane but if I just focus all my energy on loving Him.. " Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you." Matthew 6:33    It will all work out on the end because God is in control of my life... I'm not in control (thankfully!), my circumstances aren't in control... God is!     So this week I am focusing on that truth and finding peace in it.

        I feel like David Letterman giving away the "Top Ten list."   Highlights of the week:    * I only had two chocolate binges this week. ha! Not counting the fact that as I type this, I am eating a Phidelphia cream cheese turtle snack bite.  * Austin said more sentences this week than I believe he ever has.   * Whatever that "moldy" smell was in my bathroom that was driving me nuts ( I couldn't find it!), it finally went away.   * We said goodbye to our senior pastor and his wife.. I made it through without a serious breakdown. ha!  * We watched a funny movie with Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymoore- I laughed so hard that I just about peed my pants. Everyone should laugh that hard every once in a while.  * I had a Starbucks Chai Creme frappucino and even though I had to share it with Austin, it was still good. :)  * Jacob has decided this week (at age 4) that he wants to be " a pastor just like daddy" when he grows up.   * My husband let me sleep in to 9 a.m. this morning.   * When praying and upset over a few situations, God spoke so clearly to me through His word.      There it is in a nutshell. :) Now let me get back to my turtle bites.

          We are preparing for the big 4th of July celebration we are having here tomorrow evening. We will have lots of food, lots of family, lots of games, and lots of fun. We always look forward to it every year. And God is being especially nice to us this year as we have a CLEAR forcast.. No rain and about 80 degrees. Perfect!     We have so much to be grateful for and so much to celebrate for living in this country. There are times when I think my life is tough and I have it rough until I see these little children in Mexico (our church is there on a Mission trip) who literally eat dirt and garbage. Oh God, forgive me and help me to always have a thankful, grateful heart. You have blessed us with so much here in this country. Help us to appreciate it and appreciate you.      This has been a challenging week for me but nonetheless, God is so good. The words of this song really spoke to me this week:    " Blessed be your name, in the land that is plentiful, where your streams of abundance flow, blessed be your name.    Blessed be your name, when I'm found in the desert place, though I walk through this wilderness, blessed be your name.    Blessed be your name when the sun is shining down on me, when the world is all as it should be.. blessed be your name,     Blessed be your name, in the road marked with suffering, though there's pain in the offering, blessed be your name."     So my prayer in life is that when I have little or a lot, when life is wonderful or miserable, I will never fail to bless the name of the Lord.     He is just as worthy to be praised in the desert as he is on the mountain top.     God's goodness doesn't depend on my circumstances. God is always good. I am grasping that truth quite possibly for the first time in my life lately. THAT my circumstances and situations in life do not change the core of God's being.     Hopefully, the circumstances and situations will change ME- I'm the one that needs changing.     Anyway, everyone have a wonderful 4th of July and praise God that we live in a country that allows us the freedom to praise and worship God.

         This has been a tough few days. My dad's health problems continue to get worse and it's breaking my heart to see my family go downhill. I don't know how to describe the pain I'm carrying over my parent's other than a deep "gut ache."     I know God has been preparing me for some of this and as grateful as I am, it is still hard.     In my heart I believe my dad probably won't be on this earth much longer and although on one hand that brings a sense of peace (knowing he will be out of his misery- physically and mentally), and on the other hand, it just hurts.     I hate facing death. It's not as if it won't come to us or it won't touch everyone of our lives... we know it's always there and there is always that possibility of it arriving into our lives at any moment, but when the concept of reality actually IS reality... it's hard to grasp.    And yet, I know this is what faith is all about. It's easy to preach you trust and believe God but what about when the rubber meets the road?     I think I'm beginning to smell rubber.     4th of July is also upon us and it's always something I dread every year. Austin is horribly terrified of fireworks and he actually had to be sedated a few times because of his panic attacks from hearing them.    Today I took the boys' to the park and somebody nearby was shooting fireworks. Austin started screaming " I'm scared" and ran to the car. He cried and held his ears, yelling " NO Pops" (that's what he calls them becuase of the POP sound, ha!). It breaks my heart to see him so scared. It's not as if I can reason with him like you can a typical child... he only knows something is loud and terrifying.     The whole ride home he says, " I'msorry I was scared." Bless his heart. He doesn't even know why it sets him off like it does.    So I am praying God covers his ears over the next 4 days and fill Austin's heart with peace.      I am praying God cover me as well.... and feel me with peace. I definitely need Him today.

          I had to share my news about my mom. Her procedure was Tuesday and she is going to be fine. Apparently, she just had an infection in her colon from diverticulitis. They will be treating her for that but she is on the mend and doing great. Thank you for your prayers!     We've had a beautiful week here in the Pacific Northwest with awesome weather. It's been warm but not miserable. We've been swimming a lot this week and will likely be back in the pool this afternoon.     I'm having lunch with a friend from church today. It's a neat little restaurant with a "country" feel. The best part is there will be no children there- I can eat in peace. Imagine?! ha!     I haven't been sleeping too well the past few nights. Between a certain 4 year old crying out in his sleep and our motion light in the backyard going off, it's hard to sleep. Are you feeling sorry for me yet?     Austin has a dentist appointment tomorrow. He's always done fine at the dentist so hopefully he will continue in that tradition. He starts back to school in 4 weeks- I think he's ready to go back and have his routine again. He starts at a different school this year so I am praying he transitions well.     We have started the official birthday countdown for Jacob. Typically 2 months before his birthday every year, he begins asking how many days are left. He starts to plan what kind of cake he wants, what friend's he wants to attend, and what toys' he needs to increase his happiness. I don't know that I've ever seen a kid more excited to celebrate their birth. ha! He did ask me the big question a few weeks back. He said, " Mom, how did I get into your tummy when I was a baby?" So I did what any good mother would do. I said, " just one minute", grabbed the phone, called his dad at work and said, " Josh... Jacob has a question for you." tee hee. Apparently Josh satisfied Jacob's inquisitiveness by explaining that " God put you there."  So I suppose that's enough said! *wipes forehead*      This weekend is the yearly Bethel Open. Josh will be playing in a golf tournament. He's looking forward to it. I don't know why. I tried the whole "golf" thing once. It's a lot harder to hit that tiny ball than it looks. I decided I didn't like golf after that experience.  My husband's hobbies just make no sense to me. It's either him hitting something (like golf) or him being hit (like paintball). Shopping makes so much more sense. :)      Well, I need to hop in the shower before my lunch date. I hope you all have a wonderful Thursday and weekend!

          I had a strange (and awesome) experience yesterday. I was alone and out running errands in my car. I was driving down the freeway and although I was headed home when I came upon the next exit I suddenly thought, " I should get off at this exit and get some gas." It wasn't prophetic and didn't feel like divine inspiration, I just looked down and realized I had less than half a tank left.      About 3 seconds after I got on the ramp to the exit, the van that was directly in front of me on the highway and the car next to it collided. It was loud and scarey just seeing it but I realized that had I not moved onto the exit ramp, I would've been directly behind them and rammed right into them. Call it what you want.. luck... chance... whatever...but I KNOW God divinely gave me the thought to stop right then for gas. I was a little shook up realizing what COULD have happened and then I realized right then that on my radio the song, " God is in control" was playing. Just another realization that truly, God has our lives in His hands' as long as we yield them over to Him.        I had another thought... God is and was in control of my life yesterday as I was driving down that freeway and He protected me from harm BUT God would've been in JUST as much control if for whatever reason, He had allowed me to continue driving in that direction and slam into the other car's.  So He is in control of my life when He keeps me safe like He did yesterday, but even had I wrecked and lost my leg, He would've still been sitting on the throne and in control over my life.      I find comfort in knowing God is in control NO MATTER what. He's not only in control when things are good and going the way I like them to, but He's still God and Lord when things are difficult.      There are a few tv preacher's that have become "famous" for preaching the message of prosperity. Their philosophy is that if you follow God completely and have "enough faith" you will be healthy, wealthy, and comfortable.       I won't try to examine these men's hearts- that is for God to do but I beg to differ with their "philosophy." I DO believe completely and wholeheartedly that God desires to do good things in our lives and bless His children.. don't get me wrong. I know we serve a loving, giving, gracious God- He has demonstrated His blessings to me more the last month than He ever has (tangibly). BUT... that doesn't mean that if we serve Him 100% we won't experience sickness, death, financial problems, discouragement and trials. I have actually found the times I was the closest to Him, I experienced many of those things. Yet, His presence through them grew my faith and my character in such a way that those things' no longer were relevant. I began to realize that whether or not I had a lot or very little, Jesus was enough. I realized that whether I felt great or sick, Jesus was adequate. I realized that whether I mourned or danced, God was still God.         I'm thankful God is in control of my life despite what happens to me.... good or bad. I have to admit, I'm also VERY thankful that He protected me yesterday from that car wreck because I would've missed an awesome service at church today. :)         Just rest assured that if you are seeking God with all of your life- He is in control of it. So whatever you are facing right now, it is a part of His good plans for you and He has you exactly where He knows you should be. Ya never know, maybe He's just keeping you from a wreck!

      I have returned from sweet home Alabama.. it's good to be back. I realized when I was there, that I can never truly be happy again. When I am home here in Washington, I find myself missing my family in Alabama and missing the familiarity of "home." When I am back home in Alabama, I miss my husband and my home here in Washington! My grandfather said it to me best; " your heart will be where your husband and kids are, but your home will always be here ( Alabama)." There's just something about being able to drive by the home you grew up in, the neighborhood you rode your bike in as a kid, and see all the familiar buildings that bring back so many memories. I told God that if not for my love for Him and my desire to be in His will, I'd be back in Alabama in a second (with my husband and kids of course!). You just can't beat the south (or Chick Fil A and Sonic of which I had both last week!). A HUGE thank you to everyone who prayed for me and Austin on our flight. He was wonderful. We didn't have one issue and we had a very long day on our journey to Alabama. The trip back wasn't quite as long-- the only problem was that I was a bit "apprehensive" about flying back because of the terror level being raised. I know, I know.. I should trust the Lord a little more and use my imagination a little less but sure enough, as I sat down for my 4 and a half hour flight, a man of Middle Eastern descent sat down right next me. I tried very hard not to jump to conclusions, I tried making conversation with him and it became evident after I said, " hello" that he didn't speak English. I sat there anticipating him to yell out, " Allah is great" but he fell asleep 45 minutes into the flight so that enabled me to keep my eyes on him the whole time. I already figured out all the ways I would tackle him to the ground if he decided to ignite a suicide bomb. Thankfully, I had just been watching WAAAY too much Fox news and the innocent man was probably just as scared of the little blonde woman next to him that kept staring at him, as I was of him. So in a nutshell.... No... I never jump to conclusions. *smile* My mom was feeling quite a bit better by the 2nd day I was there. She actually does well until she eats- unfortunately, most people typically do that a few times a day. I was able to go with her to her doctor appointments and they had to reschedule her procedure for this coming Tuesday (Aug. 10th). There was no way I could stay that long since I had left Jacob here with his daddy so I won't be able to be there during the procedure. Just continue to pray for her. They believe they will be removing part of her colon, they just aren't sure how much just yet. Seeing my dad in the shape he is in broke my heart in a million pieces. One day he was asleep in his chair and I just stood there looking at him crying in disbelief that my young, strong, funny dad is the way he is. It hurts so much to see someone you love suffer and yet there is nothing you can do but pray. It gives me a whole new respect and concept of what God must've felt watching His Son suffer- the only difference is that He could've spared His son from the pain, but chose not to because of His love for me. There are people in my life that I love enough to die for, but I can't think of a single person that I love enough to allow one of my sons' to die for. So if you ever wonder if God loves you, think about that. I was able to see some of my wonderful family (and friends) while back there. My Aunt Pat sure looks great with all the weight she has lost.. She always was beautiful but wow, look out world! She is beginning to wonder if there is more to life than just being " really, really, really good looking." ha ha! ( yes, a little inside joke but trust me, it's funny) I am catching up on sleep and laundry now that I have returned. I have found that if I were to die, although my husband would be an excellent father, my children would be raised on cereal, corn dogs, and Pepsi Twist (at least they would get fruit from the Lemon). So I will be headed out shortly to buy REAL food. ha! I will try to be more faithful about updating this blog.. I had a few people "on me" about that so I will work harder on writing more often. Afterall, I am here to 'serve.' :) Have a great Thursday and whatever you do, don't fry bacon while naked.
