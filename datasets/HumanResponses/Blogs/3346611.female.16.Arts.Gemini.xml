						   I was trying to decide what color my blogger should be. I wanted to do it a different color other than black. Then i decided that i couldnt it wouldnt feel right. I dont know why but that seems wierd to me... anyways. I dont know i have so many web sites that have all of my suff on it hat its hard to keep track now... i jus love to type and write and just come up with random stuff ... i dunno. prehaps i should just give a blurb bout my self so its easier 4 u 2 understand... My name is Egypt. Dont ask me why thats my name... i dont know. My mom didnt want me. Im unbelievably independent ( i could walk at 9 months... no lie) Every day i have to look at my arm and see the burns she carlessly branded on me. I have a caring best friend that has her own problems even if others dont know. I do have a caring family that loves me ( most of the time). I feel like im all ways needy or loud or depressed and for some reason im allways bored.. or at least thats what Mike says. Mike... hes a good person. but just like everyone eventually im just waiting *quietly* for him to leave me. and i think some how he kinda knows this. Sometimes i feel like he wouldnt or it would take him longer if he ever wanted to break it off w/ me because he doesnt want to break me heart... but i hope not. Sometimes he says he loves me but i think he is just trying to express how he feels but doesnt know who to describe it so he uses the L word. I think... well i know im faling 4 him but i do and dont want to at the say time. Imma go but il continue this at a later date....

						   I'm writing ths early ( yes, its early) because I had the most twisted dream ever ( it even makes me think of the song by corn that screams Twist more or less the whole time). I think it happned because last night I watched the movie Cold Creek Manior. The movie was good, even good enough to make my "dream compleatly wacked out". I wold have cheacked it in my dream DICTIONARY (one of the many types I have) but, ehat the hell would i have looked under.... sick and twisted...(?) u.u.u.u.m.m ... NO! So with all this said let me try to recall this lovley dream :  Some how i mannaged to have commited man slauter ( when you dont kill them on pourpose but its your fault they died). So some how the bodie ended up on the side walk in front of my hoes ( the one at my mom's and i keep looking all the spot now:: nerviously looks around::). So when i went to go look at it it was like missing peices including the head everyone at my house tryied to cover it with a blanket and just wait for it tho thaw out of the groung ( did i mention that it was frozen to the ground?). Then I'm like fuck it so then im out there with a knife trying to break up the ice and then eveyone starts to freak out. Me being so damed lucky have police living on my street so they come out and do something (i can remember)... O..Ya we acted like my brother passed out so they were helping him, not to mention he was on top of the body because thats where it was so we had to cover. So then eventually the POlice saw the dead, frozen, bodie with no head. So since it was man slaughter I was able to get out of it. Then some how I ended up on this island thing with this beautifull. Then hell started to beak loose and the world was allmost going to end or something ( it was freakey). Then we saw this thing in the sky it looked like a metor or a ball of flames. Then it crashed on to the stone wall and exploded. The everyone was running like hell. There was this powder that came out no one knew what it was. Then someone yelled it was this stuff that makes you uncontrolably throw up so i tried to hide behind something and hold my breath so i wouldnt be a "victim". Then i noticed that there were at the least five more in the air. So then little stuff happned and i ended up in this city in a building with all of these leather products. So i guess we where going to save the world... so we were trying on like cat women clothes and my hands were to small for the gloves so I hade to special order then from a catalog ( wrecks the whole superhero imade now doesnt it) and for some reason there was this "guy" there that i guess i knew... he reminds me of the guy fom the WB Superstar show... I was so excited to see "him" for some reason. I mean extacic ... I was allmost crying I was so happy. "He" told me that "he" had the opperation done... yes he was a man now... then for some reason I got really sad and started to cry that I too wanted to be a man... wtf??... I dont know where that came from...   That was my dream and its as confusing to me as it is to you but if you know what i should look up to figure that out than leave me a note... thx...                                           Garry                                             +

						   Today I decided not to grace my school house with my wonderful little self. I decided to visit the local graveyard. It was so amazing. The feelings you get there are so relaxing. You can do anything you want and think about everything and know that your surrounded by people who have gone through the same thing, and the got through most everything alright. Everyone has there own tragedy that put them in the ground and its amusing to make up stories and think about what could have happened to Mrs.Q and why she isn't buried with her husband and if she as kids or if she was murdered. Is she blond or have red hair? It's so comforting. Its so tranquil to see and the stones lined in a row like there lined up ready and waiting to go some where , forever standing at attention. Some are crumbling or have fallen, some you can't even read... Those are the ones that I thought about the most. Would they be mad that no ones knows about them anymore? The other graves that got my attention were the ones that were families and they were all in one plot and each had the own foot and head stones... It was a picture opportunity. Everything was just so perfect...

						   Life isn't that bad recently. With that being side I'm sure something bad will occure in the recent future. Today I got the urge to got through my "memory box" whitch is this big box of stuff and picturs that my mother has collcted throught the years, all of my siblings have one. And its just so eye opeaning. I see my self at the beach when I was about five and with BOTH of my parents and it's so interesting that someone can grow from this little happy persone to such a confused rebellious teenager. I saw that in many of my picturs I had blonde hair and its just ... wierd that I'm naturally blonde... one would never think that and .... lets not tell anyone. LOL... I'm a blonde... LMFAO.... I worship hair dye!! I see pictures of me in my soccer uniforms and running around and I think to myself no matter how much I cut my self off from the world I will allways find time and  space in my heart for this game. I love it and that must by why im on varcity but thats a story for an other day... I'm getting ready to leave for my 5 year old sisters dance recital. Its going to be heart warming and not to mention compleatly hillarious... shes so cute!!! I went to my bestfriends recitial last night and I loved it. The only thing I dont like about going to things like this is that I can't do any of it. All I do is sit there and write about them... I'm jelious but no one needs to know because its fun none the less. I had pineapple today that must be why I'm in such a good mood... PINEAPPLE I just finnished doing her makeup and now its time to go.... so I must depart....bye

						   Maybe I over exaggerate things. i'm not really sure , all I know is that I'm not happy, and I dont like to be alone. I've read through other peoples journals and they're able to word everything that they feel and what the do so much better then i ever could. And I try but it doesnt sound right. No one seems to care, I dont get replies on my journal or ... have a "group" to hang out with and it doest really matter. It just sucks because I put forth all this effort for peole to be able to understand me better and its like no ones cares so.... Fuck u People. I see my friends commenting on other peoples "stuff" and couldnt give a shit about me so. *Screams* I'm fuckin tired of pretending that I want to care or that I'm just so fucking greatfull to be in everyones life but the truth is IM NOT.... If someone likes me there are 5 other people and if I'm someones friend I'm never fuckin first between their bands and there makeout buddies!!! And I dont tknow why I even try and im so pissed right now i dont even know what to do....... this is just going to be sooo fucking great but who the fuck cares and its not like anyones will even say anything anyways so.... FUCK YOU

						   This Series was written on 6.16.04. I found my self, walking around Springfield and ended up sitting in a graveyard and writing. It's a good experience for the simple reason that you’re the only living in there. You start to think about what they did or didn't do with their lives and how it all ended. It can get emotional... *sigh*.   The world has no compassion No love for what it holds The graveyard has too much It holds tightly to what it hides If you listen closely You can hear it All the stories Aged wisdom This is where I need to be Comfortable silence Where I’m the only one With the most life Instead of the one with the  Least   My own forest Of lost dreams and Finished lives My own forest Of gray stones and  Black towers My own forest Of green grass and  Brown dirt My own forest Of sad little notes and Dead silence My own forest Of tired life and Rested death   She was a timid woman With her long brunet hair And big green eyes Her skin was always thick But that’s just what the men lick That’s what they want That day someone didn’t  He watched her Stalked like dinner And waited He needed her to die Surround his knife- With her throat Now she’s here- In this ground That I lay on   You’re just blowing Feeling the wind Caressing your petals Brighter than the sun Reflecting your yellow rays The bee stole your candy Your sweet insides You’re still beautiful Always and eternally There are so many of you  You’re everywhere   I think I thought you were someone else It’s my fault I just fell for the wrong person You were always a little mysterious Never really knew what you thought Of the world around us In case you don’t see  Just in case you haven’t noticed I’m here pouring my heart out to you It’s bleeding because of you I thought you were someone else Someone a little likes me Someone who actually gave a dammed  Well forgive me for taking this time To say this I’m just looking in on you From the out side These tears were for my sake This is my down on my knees   The golden arches And red rooftops… Did they put that McDonalds there, to just tease these people? So they can smell the food But can get to it The French-fry perfume equalizing In the air Sweeping through the air And torching their graves They’re so hungry And they can smell the food      I'm luckey if anyone is even still readling so . I wont bother you with anymore of my on going pondering and useless babbles. I just wish some one would act like they care. I would like that be thats far from ever happening. Don't I sould like the biggest loser in this thing. AHhhhh.... thats why I keep everything in my head and not say much about my feeings, I guess.

						   I've come to conclusion that the root of my unhappiness is my unablity in getting over things. I constently bring negitive energy from other situations into new ones. In return messing those up, creating more suckey energy and... so on. It's a vicious cycle. Like in relationships. I end up messing on up, then in order to get over that, I start a new on with out having moved on from the past one. Then that one gets fucked up and I now have two "situations" to deal with. Why do I do this?  Joe called me today. I have no clue why. He said it was just to say hi, it mine-as-well have been to talk aboutt he weather. It was wierd. I should have been like " So did you get any better at sex?" But then I would have felt bad, or just laughed in his face.... well... in his ear.I dunno.  I went over my dads house for the first time in about 1 and one half weeks. I did NOTHING except watch T.V. Quite educational, if I do say so. I think I scare my youngest brother. He just kept yelling "no". But, he would go near Jake for a while to so that wasn't to bad.  Then my momma had to weigh my sister for some studdy thing and then my mom weighed herself, just to see. She was like 132lbs. or something and my smart ass brother goes " You wiegh less than her" and points to me. I flipped out and ran up stairs and slammed the door. I put el radio on and started musicing. Then he came in to apologise or whatever , cus my mom made him. I told him I don't care and to get the hell out of my room. O, by the way im less then 130lbs. So .... fuck you, jerk!   I got my Drivers book Thingy today. It's wayyyy to confusing for me. I like the colors though.  Steve pissed me of just now. I'm only suposed to be online on even hours. But its 10 at night so who the hell is gunna call. Then he made it sound like I took the fone line up all day. I WASNT EVEN HOME FROM 3-8 SO .... BLAH. And I was only on today from 11-12 today so..... what are you talkin about?  I just wish I had someone................

						   The world just keeps going and going and it wont stop for anyone. Don't ask how i thought of that, it came out. Anyways, today I went to 6 Flags. It was fun. I love the Superman he is quite sexy. It's better than sex and drugs.... ,sex ON drugs even. I ment this awesome guy he just graduated, has a car, is moving into his own place, works, amazingly funny, he is a little immature though but, we'll see. He held my hand. Why do people do that? I guess it's just so they can touch, but in an appropriate way..... *pondering*. I think I have a short attention span. I don't understand how you can fry icecream. Why doesnt it melt? What does it taste like?  He said he wanted my eyes and that they reminded him of his cat. That confused me. Do I have cat eyes? Or do I as a person remind him as his domesticated animal? I think its the first one..... I'm suposed to call him tonight. HEY.... I'm supposed to call Steve too.....I will. Since I can only go online on odd hours, I'll use the phone on even ones.... nice plan.  I got an other number today but, I won't use it. He was from Boston and I couldnt understand his ghetto, rapper, boston, street, slurred, slang and I really didnt want to. As soon as he asked me if I had any i dunnoo.. G2g.... I'll be back at 9... lol

						   What if I have no purpose? What if I die before I fulfill my destiny? What if I gave up everything just to write?  What if I wake up twenty years from now and I'm alone. What if I don’t affect the word? What if I don’t have a destiny?  What if I'm worthless? What if I never figure myself out? I think I'm some experiment that the higher energy came up with to see what happens. My soul is either very old or extremely new. Do I understand and question to much because I'm more in tune than most or am I so out of it that I can’t figure all of this out, yet. Everything is here I just have to piece this together. Someday I'm going to affect the world. I’ll make people dig a little deeper. Life is wasted on figuring out what life is. Given the opportunity to do something out of the ordinary, I always take it. What if there is more after this existence, a higher world. Is there really a god, or is it all energy. I believe in energy, the feeling that jolts through your body. You can feel it in every emotion.  Some people cant handle it. What goes through people’s minds when they take their lives? Who would miss me if I did? Would the world be any different?

						   Hello,        I'm so clueless how to start this one. There’s so much to think about. There’s the type of people in this world that don't think but talk about a whole lot of nothing. I'm the type of person that thinks way to much and still talks about a whole lot of nothing. I've never really had anyone seriously ask me what I'm thinking. And if they have then I just say “nothing”, and the world just keeps spinning. Then, I think someone did seriously ask me what I was thinking and there was something about it. It was just the feeling. All this stuff started to whirl and twist in my head. Everything was just going so fast something’s were about pointless nothings and some were about.... Everything and why anything happens. Why we were really there. How someone is so passionate about something and is so open about everything, I've never been faced with that before. It wasn't like someone I would just talk to about the weather. Sooner or later, I could really talk to him and I DON"T talk to people and I've never had to. Everything that already is happening FEELS like.... there’s no one else. It's so hard to go through life alone. Sure I have friends but do you think someone actually knows what I feel. It just stops me from having to defend myself. If I say something then it might not come out right or what if it comes out and its nothing. This is what I do I write. And it feels right. But it's so easy to be scared because if I can't talk about how I feel and I write it I still put myself out there. It's such a simple concept. My own mother didn’t want me, and I'm the fuck up child of the people that thought they did. Sure, I have no problem asking people and talking about them. But I feel like I have this big huge secret. Like my whole little world is untouchable to everyone except me. I don't know what you wanted. If I was supposed to defend why I live or tell you something that know one knows. But everything I probably would have said most likely wouldn't have mattered. Other people are so much easier to...They just have no clue. It's not like I have all these stories that can explain how I am. It's all emotion. It's the way the air feels, the thoughts swimming in my head, there’s so much energy that it gives you. To have all of this understanding and raw energy and be able to write that, transfer that to paper, to be able to just hold your mind in your hand. That ballpoint pen, when it's in my hand everything stops. It's me trying to make sense of all of this. Why everything is. All I have are questions.   If you think about something so hard and break it down in your mind everything is so amazing. People are so messed up and unbelievable. A simple plant is still interesting to me. Everything has it’s own way about this earth and I try to not take any of it for granted.   What is love? Is there true love? I think some people have this connection and energy between them that would be so difficult to live with. Of course there are so many people in this world who won’t feel that. It could because they’re not with the right person or they can't find them. I was so wrapped up in this one person, that when he said he felt nothing for me... It confused me. How someone can feel so strongly about someone and have the other person not feel anything. It’s a mixture of emotions and you don't know what to do with it. It's funny in a way because you feel like the moron and why the hell did you put your self in this "situation" again. At the same time though you’re so confused, depressed, insulted, disappointed, and worthless all you can do is cry. Laugh and cry… all emotions expressed at the same time. It feels so bad and so good. I’ve only done this once and this is very interesting to me. How I could have felt like that and just be pushed away so hard? Then have the opportunity to talk, but not be able to. It was enough for me to just be there and just feel like that. It’s scary because talking about all of this would mean that I’m opening up to someone, especially him. And I’ve tried to do that or would have already but instead I got hurt. And that’s how it is with everything; I can’t keep putting myself in that situation. A lot of time I try to find my happiness in other people but then when it gets fucked, I have nothing. I know what it’s not a healthy thing to do but I’m not exactly the picture of intelligence.   It’s so amazing how you can break someone’s heart and not know them. Not have a solid understanding of the person but still have such an effect on them. There are very few people that are so self directed and interactive and intriguing. Why do I do this?  Everything about you is real and genuine and truthfully that’s what I don’t deserve.

						     I can't do anything about it and that's what gets to me. Maybe I should tell him to come over here. I could hide him somewhere. " I just called to tell you I care about you" that's what he said to me. Like I would never get to see him again... And I didn't like it. He's out there, right the fuck now, just walking around. Where is he going to end up? WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I DO. He acted like it was nothing. He acted like it was everything!!! And at the moment it is.... What the fuck is going on? He told me not to worry and hes just an other person... What the hell does that mean. I wanted to yell "No the hell your fuckin' NOT" He's mine, and I have no way of fixing any of this... It's fuckin thundering and lightning and hes just ... Out there. I need to find him. You have no clue how great this guy is. There's so much he hes able to understand... There are people who know, people who are able to know and people who will never know. He's able to know so much and.... Already does ... This is the last thing I need right now.....  WHERE IS HE?

						   I find some kind of fulfillment in these chemicals. I get these chills and tingles through out my body, like I'm being touched from the inside instead of the out side. No matter what's going wrong or everything I have to think about it all feels okay as long as I combine them with a little pill. My new weapon of choice are chopsticks. It adds such a interesting element to eating like there's some artistic quality to it. Like I can still carry out my artistic destiny while I eat.  It amazes me that I can feel so strongly about someone but, remain so...Calm. Like it doesn't phase me, even though it does. I'm just talented at hiding my feelings.

						    Why do I do some of the things I do? Why do I do anything I do? Just because I can get attention doesn't mean I have to take it. I have a boyfriend... I shouldn't need to do this anymore. I do though and that's what throws everything off track. He doesn't know that since we have been together I have slept with two other people (within the same week). I guess it would count as two.. Its so messed up. I want to be with him and I can see myself with him and that's what's so scary to me. I just don't want to get caught up in one person because than that's how I get hurt. I really don't feel like getting hurt and more. I guess I figured that's if I act the way I do then, it wont matter. I do have feelings for other people but that shouldn't matter right now because I did say I would be with Chris. And fucking with people under bridges and sneaking people in my room at night isn't exactly the peachyest way to maintain a relationship. I have two options here: 1. Say with him and possibly get hurt or spend a substantial amount of my future with him. 2. Tell him I cant be with him and never have what could be. I could see myself with him, he's is such an amazing person. I don't know if I'm scared that it won't work or it will. But what about him....?  Now I feel selfish. What about him. How he feels. I also don't want to hurt him. And if he knew then , I would. I have no feelings for John, I like Steve, I've been in love with James for the past... 2 years(just about), I feel safe, cared for, special and just like... I'm the only one when I'm with Chris. He likes my family, he wants to be with me, he the only guy to ever buy my roses... #!%#^*^%(@^CONFUSED%*&$^$#&^* I do want to be with him. I just have to get everything together...

						   It's rainy out and cold and I'm tired. There is nothing to do. I'm addicted to chopsticks and it's one of my better addictions. I miss Chris. I'm cold and tired. I can't remember James phone number but probably wouldn't call him if I did. I don't feel like interrupting peoples lives at the moment. I feel gross. Last night I took a few Perkisets and everything was just fucking amazing for a while. Then I started to get itchy... Not the greatest but still pretty good. Chris woke me up at 11 this morning and... Yea. Then Steve called me about an hour ago. I'm speaking with John on AIM at the moment but he has nothing interesting to say so, I'm incredibly bored.Like for some reason your suposed to rush to the blinking orange light as soon as you can. The little bit of mystery is to much and you must find out what was said. Its does suck you into a vortex of AIM curiosity. I can hear the birds on the roof...

						   It's interesting how some one can openly complain how they want something. They wish and wish they had it, then they get it. Only to find out that's NOT what they relay want anymore. This simple concept can pertain to so many different situations.   The worst type of depression is when you can't quite figure out what is wrong. If you know what is making you "INFELICITOUS" then you can do something about it. If you have no clue what it is then what are you supposed to try and change? Some people the only way they know how to deal with these feelings are to make them a physical enigma. Then they are able to say, "Here is the pain. Its right here on my arm and I can see it so now I can deal with it." In reality the only thing that they are doing is not only destroying them selves mental they have now begin to destroy them selves physically as well.   Love is such a complex subject. Sometimes I think love is just a biological urge. Other times love seems like a spiritual quality. Love, unlike matter and energy, seems limitless. But on the other hand love is created my matter. The only organisms that are able to feel love are organisms that are able to function not only in a physical way but also in a semi-intellectual state. We are able, if we let our selves to separate thoughts and feelings whitch ultimately can be combined and mistaken for each other.

						   Once upon a time... blah blah blah. Then they all lived happily ever after. Who writes this? Does this ever come true? Does everyone know that Alice in Wonderland was a bout the author's LSD tripps? I'm sure most don't. Then the public wonders why teens like to do drugs.... WE'VE BEEN WATCHING HOW FUCKIN AWESOME THEY ARE SINCE WE WERE TWO! "Here hun, I don't feel lke dealing with you so I just put in theis movie that will ultimatly lead to your O.D.I hope you like it." It's not like anyone will understand it anyways so all in all i guess its fine.   I've said it before. I wish I was born in the 60's or even the 50's. Everything was just so real. You had to work hard, there were morals, everyone ... was just different. There is a reason for everything. There have to be people like me in every generation. Were ment to set everyone straight and try to fix this.It's like evrything is slowly eroding and no one can see it.

						    I feel this big right now. I'm so confused but at the sametime I'm not. NO... confused is the wrong word. I have to stop using that word, it gives off the wrong impression. I know what I want , know I can't get it, know how I feel but can't change it so inconclusion have no decision to make. So why do I even keep thinking about it. Perhaps it's because I don't have what I want. WAIT I do have what I want I just don't have it with the person I want it with... Man, this sucks.    &nbsp;  I read these lyrics the other day and they reminded me of&nbsp;James. The whole James thing is normal. I mean it's how it should be, we talk from time to time and obviously he knows how I feel and it just... is. I guess I'm just glad that were talking again.     &nbsp;  I saw Chris last night. I'm not saying anything else about that incounter...( read the tital ). He said that he is starting to fall in love with me. I don't know what to say to that. People arn't suposed to do that. At age 15 I decided that I was okay with being alone my whole life and I think I do a great job at it. i keep to myself and don't bother people with my problems. Now I have someone that WANT'S&nbsp; me to do that. What is the world coming to?     &nbsp;  I talk to Steve alot. I think because of all undecided decisions I've made I'm starting to like him only as a friend.    &nbsp;  And because of John I'm promising to myself that I will no longer have sex with peope that I'm not with or have no feelings for.     &nbsp;  I find it amazing how&nbsp; their are couples out there who are so compleatly wrong for each other. One of them can be so evolved as a person and the other can be so clueless, but it works. It never has for me but, sometimes it does. I think its a power tripp for the more evolved one. I guess they have to learn some how.     &nbsp;  Why do I suround my self with shallow nothings. I need to drown in the depths of someones soul. I'm so sick of pretending nothing is everything. When in reality no one realizes that everything IS nothing. THEY have to CREATE their own existance.

						    Ethyl is so amazing. Everything including the the ceiling is interesting.&nbsp; Chris said he loves me tonight. I believe him and that's the scary part. I'm so tried of al of this reality. Everything is so serious can't anyone take a break. I guess not because if it wasn't real it wouldn't be reality. To night was fun no matter how much I complain. And my life is fucken awesome, and I do have an awesome fucken boyfriend. Sometimes I just think that I don't deserve any of it.&nbsp; As much as I would like to be with James I could see my self eventually completely happy with Chris. I need to get out of here.....

						   I keep looking out my window as if I'm going to see heaven, but I can't. We drove to far and now it's out of reach. The sky and the moon's reflection over the rippling water made me feel like my spirit wanted to fly out of my body and return to it's rightful place. I would just stare out at the ocean and feel like it's to beautiful to be true, as if its some giant movie screen that's able to display true beauty.  I'm back from vacation and there is no sand infesting all of my belongings. I'm back from vacation and I can't hear the crashing of the waves. I'm back from vacation and there aren't any seagulls over head. I'm back from vacation and I can sleep in my own bed. I'm back from vacation and there aren't people walking around half naked.  I didn't write one word that could be described as intellectual, physiological or meaningful the whole week that I was gone. I feel guilty like if I couldn't find time to write that subconsciously means I shouldn't be a writer in the first place. I wanted to write I really did, but there was always people around and always something to do.  The Clash The Doors The Ramones  Why are all the good "punk" bands names begin with the word "THE"???? ... Wait The Doors aren't punk ... Yes, they are The Doors explore other genres of music but they have been labeled as punk... And The Clash are a British punk band and The Ramones are just an awesome fucking punk band.  "Did ya see waht I did, Did ya see, Did ya see?" "Are you Nanna" "If you could would you be Tony Hawk?" "Will you sign my MILF book?" "Where do you want to to BITE you?"
