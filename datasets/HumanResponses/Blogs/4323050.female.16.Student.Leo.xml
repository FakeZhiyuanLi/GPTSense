         Well I don't really know what to write... hmmm...   I guess I could start of with what I'm doing huh... I guess I got the idea from my good bud Steve Dykstra. At camp he wrote down his Blogspot address and I've been kinda reading it since then. I always get these online diary things and kinda end up forgetting about them a month later. I usually end up writing pages and pages of almost nothingness and bore people. Cept usually they don't find our I run one of these things. So it doesn't bother me. I might end up giving Alisa the link but that's about it I think.      What's the point of these things anyway? Why do I enjoy writing in them so much? Umm... well doctors always tell me keep a diary... Maybe this should become my diary... maybe not... I have one at   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com    but this one's kinda cool... I can put pictures up! I kinda like this.... livejournal is a little boring... So yeah that's it for now I'm off to bed I think... bubbyes

        I'm confused...   How many times have I said that lol.... But this is a new confusion....   So I'm taking a lot of Math, Physics, and Computer Sciences in school... along with the manditory Religion, English, and my absolute must of Photography this year. My goal since about grade 8 has been to go into programming as a career, simply because I've seen how much money successfull programmers make. My dad completely convinced me that if I want a relaxed lifestyle (relaxed, according to his definition, means not to be worried about financial things...), then I should do something that has a good income. His friend at the time was, well still is, a programmer running his own business at home. I think he does SAP, security systems most likely. They live well. Financially. Since we as a family don't have it too great when it comes to money, my dad always says "Everything you've ever wanted... you can have with this career." Plus, there's a big demand for programmers apparently, and on top of it all, it's something I enjoy and apparently I'm good at it.    But it's not convincing me to make a living out of it...   Lately I've been thinking of doing something else with my life other than being a computer geek. I've talked to a number of people who are in their University/College studies, or have just finished... I found a lot of people are doing their ECE's and then some are going from there to Psychology... so they'll be doing Child Psychology. That's something I've always been into... but I don't have the mental or emotional strength to do that.    Then there are my musician friends. Some of my friends are studying Music in they Post-Secondary and go from there. One of my friends took it a step further and went to Ministry with his music....   Another thing that I'd love to do, or have a great interest in. Ministry. I was talking to Jamie about TACF and the Toronto School of Ministry. He studied Song Writing and some other music courses I guess, and he recorded the most amazing CD last year! Basically he went all out on Worship and he is loving every minute of it. When we talked about Ministry at camp he told me he thinks I'd fit right in at the Ministry School he went to. I'm kinda looking into it right now. But I'm not sure what I'll do when I get there. I don't know if I want to be a pastor... what else is there to do then? I could do Worship, make a musical life for God... how does that sound? Oh man.   So I kinda just told my mom about Ministry and she doesn't sound too happy with it... The Pastor dude at our school, Mr. Adams, he used to be an Engineer. Then he got "The Call" and went into Ministry, teaching at our school kinda thing.    Man I need more time to think....
