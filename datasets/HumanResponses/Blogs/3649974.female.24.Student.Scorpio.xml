      So, i'm still with him kinda.  Except it's been three weeks since we had sex.  I can't tell you what that does for my self-image.  He has told me he wants it a few times on the computer, but he can't say anything when i'm in the room with him.  That makes me feel sooo bad.  It makes me feel that he finds me so unattractive that he can't think of sex with me until he doesn't see me.  Until he's watching hot girls get fucked in porn.  I know i don't look that bad.  But it makes me feel like i must be such a horrid looking person.  This constant rejection is killing me.  I really need to do something about it.  But he's basically become my best friend over the past year and i don't want to lose that.  ANd i don't want to see him with anyone else.  UGH.  It's just very painful.  Well, i got a C in financial accounting.  I passed, but if i hadn't gotten bronchitis i prolly would have gotten an A.  BLEH.   I'm supposed to write down 5 to 10 goals for my character in the Shadowrun game, due tomorrow.  I will get an extra point of Karma for it.  But i really don't feel like doing that now.

Does any other female in the universe have this problem? A man that she has to practically beg to get sex from?  SOOO fucking annoying.  He used to tell me how amy would bitch cuz he wanted sex everyday.  Yeah that makes me feel real great.  When he was with her, he wanted sex everyday, with me he want's it like once a month.    It honestly makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.  First there's something so wrong with me that no one can love me, and now i have to beg for sex. AND what's with the you can just give me oral! ARGH! WTF! who the hell does he think he is! AAAARRRRGGGGHHH!!!!!

      Ok, so my shrink thinks i need to start wrighting down all my negative thoughts.  I think maybe this is a good idea.  But maybe i'll write down more than just my negative thoughts, cuz that would be just plain negative.    I'm a very difficult person to understand.  My friends describe me as wierd, but it's a good wierd, it's always said with a smile. SO it's 12:16 am June 16th.  I'm 5'6, and about 275 lbs give or take a few.  I'm not at all happy about that.  I'm pretty attractive looking even though i'm fat, but in the past few years it has wrecked my self esteem.  I used to think i knew who i was and what i was doing.  Now i have no idea, i just go day by day, hoping things will one day get better.    See i think i'm in love.  But i shouldn't be.  I've been seeing joey for a little over a year now.  We're "just friends who have sex" but it's not just that.  ANd i'm not the only one who thinks so, my friends agree with me.  It's the way we act when we're together and when we're not.  And i am trying very hard to ignore that i am in love with him.  I don't think he's in love with me.  I honestly believe there is something wrong with me that makes me impossible to love.  I don't think anyone has ever really loved me, and i do mean anyone including family.  Maybe my sister, she might love me, but she's 13, so i can't just go over there and talk to her, she's way to young to deal with my problems.  Nevermind the fact that i just want to protect her and she doesn't need to know all the bad crap about me.  Joey lived with Amy for 5 years.  I think she's the only person he's REALLY been in love with.  I think he still loves her.  I think he still want's to be with her.  I sit here wondering how long it will be until he finds a way to be with her again.  She doesn't want him, he treated her badly.  I'm sure it was a two way street, but i think he was probably to immature for the relationship.  But the point is, he still loves her.  He can't love me if he loves her.  He is always saying how much love sucks, and how he's never doing it again, how it's not worth it.  That really hurts.  But i can't say anything to him about the fact that it hurts when he says that cuz then he'd know that i have love for him.  ANd a part of me is afraid that we would no longer be anything if he knew how i felt.  What the fuck makes her so special and me so unworthy?  That's all i want from him, i want him to feel the way i do.  Then there's Gina.  Gina is a girl who joey has slept with in the past.  They have been friends since high school and still are.  He has slept with her since i've been with him.  He claims he doesnt' sleep with her anymore, but i don't believe him.  She comes into town to visit her parents and has to see him everyday that she's home.  Joey get's very wierd when she's in town, i can usually tell before he says anything.  It's like he feels guilty.  Last time she was here, i kinda caught him in a lie.  I was with him, and she called.  He was going to her house to hang out with her mom (RIGHT).  Cuz i go to my friends houses to hang out with their parents (please).  And that he would only be there for about an hour, maybe an hour and a half, then he'd be over Gilmen's house.  So i dropped him off at home, and went home.  Two hours later, around 11 pm i went to Gilmen's house.  No joey.  I waited for another hour.  At midnight i called him to see why he wasn't there.  He called me back to say that they were watching a movie, and he'd be over there for a while longer.  Mind you, there was absolutely no noise in the background.  I don't believe him.  Maybe there was a movie, maybe there wasn't, but i just get the feeling that there's sex going on.  ANd ya know, i don't like it.    If i were to sleep with another guy, he'd be done with me.  He hasn't said it but he has eluded to it.  Just looking at what i've written makes me think i shouldn't be with him.  But i want to be with him.  ARGH! I think i may be setting myself up for another heartache.  I know he has no real feelings for me, i'm pretty sure he's sleeping with other people, he has no intention of being in a relationship anytime soon.  WHat the fuck am i doing with him.  Am i really so screwed up in the head that i think all this is ok?  I know that it's not ok.  I just don't have the willpower to stop seeing him.  Cuz what if i'm wrong, what if he's not sleeping with Gina.  What if he's no longer in love with Amy?  What if he does love me, and just can't say it?  What if he is the perfect man for me, cuz we get along soooo well in every way.  I just don't know what to do.

      so i don't know if it's the depression or if this is because i talked to my dad.  i'm really really pissed off at him.  he feels bad that my sister is being raised by an incompetant person such as my mother.  OMFG! what the fuck does he think i've been living through for the past 24 years.   he was and still is in total fucking denial about the abuse i had to put up with from her.  and if i try to say something about it, he just goes silent and continues on his thought.   I wish my mother wasn't totally fucking psychotic. i wish my father wasn't in total fucking denial ... i could save my sister from the situation she is in.  i don't want her to be 24 and having the understanding that noone can love her.  that there is something fundamentally wrong with her that makes her unworthy of anyone's affections. i wish i could stop being with joey.   i wish i could trust my own emotions. i feel like i love him, but i can't trust that.  i have no way of knowing if it's real.  and even if i did really love him, he won't love me, so i'm just wasting my energy. i wish i was hot so someone would want me. even though i thoroughly believe that is wrong. i wish i could get affection and touch in some way other than through sex. i wish being alone was good enough for me. i wish i was good enough. i wish  joey wasn't using me for something until... i wish i had not put myself in this situation. i wish i had the self esteem to get out. i wish i thought more of myself, and not to feel that i am totally worthless. i hate saying that i am worthless, i don't think i really am, but i feel that i am.  i hate that joey said "where's my girlfriend" when referring to a hot girl at the movies tonight. i hate when he says "i wouldn't kick her out of bed in the morning" i dont' even spend the night, never mind get to stay in bed in the morning. i hate the way he is about gena. i hate that i know that if i tell him any of this we will be over, or we will continue to be the same i hate that he won't change i hate that i am not good enough for him i hate knowing that he won't change, and yet i continue to be with him i hate wanting to be with him i hate wishing he wanted me i hate allowing myself to think of any future with him i hate the disappointment and hurt i feel when i realize it will never happen, cuz he will never change. i hate that i am not good enough for him to change. i hate that he can't love me. i hate that he can't kiss me, or be affectionate in public i hate that he drinks i hate that he smokes i hate that i should be a mother right now, and i'm not i hate that i still want to be a mother i hate that i have to convince myself to take my bc pill everyday i hate that i won't go to the gym and watch what i eat i hate that i have such a hard time dealing with life life that seems so easy to so many others i hate that i can't see life ever being better.
