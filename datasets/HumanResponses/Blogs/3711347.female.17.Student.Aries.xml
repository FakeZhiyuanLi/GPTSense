      I'm feeling it rite now.Yes.My throat is going to b swollen.I've just recovered from fever last wk n here i am getting sick again.Mayb bcoz of dat SuperBoring Orientation dat hv to sit in an air-con room for long hours.I can't b in a cold place for so long,i can't drink cold water..coz my body resistance is weak as i don't consume green vegetables. But to tell the truth,i'm stubborn.After so long i didnt drink cold water,I've started drinking ice water on saturday during barbecue wif my cousin.From then onwards,i keep on drinking cold water.N get sick.Orgh~

      Every day is a boring day. Too lazy to go out. I think i will be staying at home for the whole of Wednesday,23 June 2004. There goes my chore again. Cook,eat,eat watermelon,watch TV,talk to imran on the fon,clean the kitchen,log on to internet,sleep. Dat's wat i did yesterday,22 june 2004. Cooked a pot of porridge by demand from Ida,my younger sister. She wanna diet dats y! Then watched TV. Talked on the fon wif Imran. Fried french fries n chicken 4 both younger sis. Then log on to the internet. I'l b sleeping late. Always. Coz i cant sleep. Its been a boring holiday 4 me. yes. Very. I'm putting on weight. Gained 3KG alredi! Dat is a lot! Nvm,hopefully, when sch starts,i will slim down again! Hehe! Now then i realised dat i'm talking crapz! So I'm done.
