      I’m staying away from the news these days, for the usual “no stress” reasons, but I do catch blurbs all day, on the radio, on Web sites, and on TV. Yesterday that blurb was “embryonic stem cell research.”   Conservatives are often accused of being “evil.” We don’t care about the poor or the working class. We don’t care about minorities. And now, we don’t care about Alzheimer’s patients.   This frustrates me because, if the people who criticize the president over this issue would just sit down and do the research, they would see that he has taken a responsible approach to government’s involvement in stem cell research. I just think that people don’t know the full story.   Research on embryonic stems cells started just six years ago, although Congress moved to ban federal funding of it eight years ago. George W. Bush made that ban permanent, but has allowed federal funding for the 71 lines that were already created, where the life and death decision already has been made.   Although thousands of embryos exist in this country, the “extras” created during in vitro fertilization, researchers continue to create and clone embryos solely for research. They continue to create life just to destroy it. And they say WE don’t care about people? By the way, the IVF embryos still have human life potential (check out the Snowflakes Embryo Adoption Program).   According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), embryonic stem cell research (which requires the destruction of a week-old human embryo) has not led to any treatments for any diseases, but may “at some point in the future.” In addition, 20% of animals injected with these cells developed untreatable brain tumors. Scientist are finding that embryonic stem cells are hard to control.   Adult stem cells from bone marrow, however, have been used to fight fatal and chronic diseases for over 30 years. Within the last few years, scientists have discovered that we also produce stem cells in our brain, blood, blood vessels, skeletal muscle, skin and liver. They have turned adult liver cells into insulin-producing cells. They’ve turned blood stem cells into brain cells and heart muscle, for God’s sake!   The NIH says that adult stem cells have a “significant advantage” over embryonic stem cells: We all have them, and if we needed a therapy requiring stem cells, we could use our own, thereby negating the need for immunosuppressant drugs.   Another source of stem cells is the umbilical cord. Scientists have found a way to make these stem cells multiply to the point that they can be used to treat an adult (previously only children could be treated with cord blood stem cells). One woman’s chemotherapy depleted blood was replenished using the cord blood of the baby she just delivered. They think treatments like this could be standard WITHIN A FEW YEARS.   The NIH says that adult stem cells have a huge potential to deliver treatments for Parkinson’s, diabetes and damage from heart attacks. Real-life people are already receiving real-life treatments, unlike the mythical treatments that may someday be developed using embryos.&nbsp;   To destroy one life to possibly save another devalues all human life. The routine practice of destroying embryos for research is a dark and dirty road that the U.S. government should not travel.   For the people who want funding for embryonic stem cell research, go organize a fund raiser. There are plenty of firms conducting this research, just make a donation to them if you choose to.&nbsp;   The stem-cell research issue is just another bogus attempt by the left to discredit the president and American conservatives. It's another attempt to use emotion and fear to try to sway people to the their side. All I can say is, when the most stirring, raise-the-rafters speech at the Democratic Convention is delivered by the Rev. Al Sharpton, then you know, THEY ARE IN TROUBLE.

      Even though I’m a perfectionist, I know that no one’s perfect, no human anyway. I like to think that we are perfect in our imperfection.   Maybe my perfectionism led me to editing. What better job than the office nit picker? A comma here, a switch from passive to active voice there. Taking imperfect text and making it, if not perfect, at least publishable.   But as a stay-at-home mom, there’s no clear-cut way to satisfy my perfectionism, or even my need for a general sense of control. I can only balance the good with the bad.   Good things I did today as a mom:  1. Cooked oatmeal with fresh blueberries, ground flax seed and organic soymilk for the boys’ breakfast.  2. Went on to feed them snacks and, yes, even lunch.  3. Put John down for a nap promptly at 1:30 so that he wouldn’t get into that “hitting mood.”  4. Washed a load of clothes and put it in the dryer.  5. Coaxed my 4 year old to practice writing before turning on his afternoon video.   Bad things I did today as a mom:  1. Slept in until 8 a.m., five minutes before Ben woke up.  2. Fed the kids an unhealthful quantity of raisins so that I could dawdle at my PC a little longer.  3. Let them jump on the couch cushions, threats of uncoiled springs and bruised heads be damned, so that I could linger over my magazine a little longer.  4. Lost my patience with them at least five times – between the fights over toys, the poop on John’s hands, the wrestling over my lap at story time, the refusal to eat the previously-begged-for macaroni and cheese, the pulling of my hair by John as I knelt cleaning up spaghetti at his feet – leading me to speak in volumes so loud that my friend from the next town called to see if I was OK.  5. Stayed home on a beautiful day without taking the kids to the park, for a walk or even for a ride in the car.   It’s become clear to me that, while I love my kids more than life, I did not miss a calling to be a preschool teacher or daycare provider. Being my kids’ caretaker wears me out. It may be because I gave up caffeine two weeks ago, but I was so tired by 2:30 this afternoon that my limbs hurt. And all I could think was that I still had six hours to go, which would surely include six cases of Ben’s covert candy eating, four cases of who hit who, five cases of someone whipping a hard toy at my wall or furniture, three cases of me screaming and instantly regretting it. Plus a load of laundry to fold and put away, dinner to make, dishes to wash and put away, the evening “put the house back together” ritual, bedtime stories, a shower for me ... Thank God Brian came home early because of the Democratic National Convention, and took the kids to the park for awhile.   Perfection? Kids make it easier to let it go, because when you have to kiss a boo boo while you’re taking a poop, when you hop up six times while eating a sandwich to wipe hands, get more ketchup or give a time out, when you don’t finish doing the bare minimum required of this lucrative occupation until 9 at night, you learn that the dust on the bookcase kind of covers that scratch, and that your husband’s shirt looks pretty good hanging over the dining room chair, and why on earth make pancakes from scratch when they sell them already made? A little partially hydrogenated fat and high fructose corn syrup probably won’t hurt them, too much.   As I pursue “balance,” I have to admit that I cannot:  - Feed my family fresh bread from organic wheat which I grow and grind myself.  - Single handedly teach my children at home while being a successful freelance writer and running an organic farm in my backyard.  - Keep my house spotless top to bottom, look presentable, exercise, eat well, play with the kids, do the laundry, cook dinner, and still have enough energy to say “Hello” or even smile at Brian when he gets home.   But I’ll keep striving for that perfect life, where, having “excavated my authentic self,” I will know my “limits” and my “boundaries,” and I will pursue my “passion,” so that even work is fun and earns me enough money to take six weeks off a year, hire a sitter and personal chef while paying for the kids’ college education. For now, though, perfection will have to be a day in which my husband comes home early and takes the kids to the park, so that I can go for a long walk and think about what I’m grateful for, then come back home and cook dinner, in peace.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       My mantra this week is "no stress." I'm at the point where I get residual anxiety. I'll be sitting around, watching TV, and be seized by panic and dread. Part of it's from being a mom, I think. For no reason some awful thought like Ben getting hit by a car or John falling down the stairs will pop into my head.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I can't sleep. Or I'll get stressed to the point that I scream at the kids, to the point where I feel enraged.&nbsp; I hate yelling at my kids. It makes me feel like the scum of the earth.&nbsp; I can't be getting enraged every day.   So, what, yoga? Meditation? I'm exercising, and eating right, getting mostly enough sleep.  &nbsp;  We're trying to get pregnant, another reason why I can have no unnecessary stress. In March I had a miscarriage, so that makes this process more annoying:   - Try. (That's the only good part.)  - Wait.&nbsp; For weeks. While abstaining from caffeine, beer, advil, jogging (listed in order of importance).  - Get "fake-out" cramps that come and mysteriously go away ("This must be it!").  - Get period and remember what real cramps feel like.  - Drink too much for six straight days until it's time to try again. (It's the "If I get pregnant I won't be able to drink for a year, so I might as well drink now!" party! Doesn't every woman do that?)   Of course, the other scenario is actually Becoming Pregnant. Then a whole new family of stressors will invade my life. And my body. Ever see Alien? Pregnancy sucks all the energy out of you, then wakes you every hour to pee. It disengages your esophogeal sphincter so that you get heartburn up to your tonsils. It swells your ankles till they look like your thighs. (Well, in my case, a little smoother.) It expells from your body an infant that only likes to be awake between 1 and 5 am and screams bloody murder from 5 to 9 pm.   So no stress relief via a cold beer at the end of a long hot summer day chasing and screaming at my 2- and 4-year-old boys. Meanwhile, my job as Mom entails keeping the kids entertained, changing the sheets, vacuuming and dusting, cleaning the toilets and tub, doing the laundry and ironing, and of course shining the sink, plus grocery shopping, cooking three meals a day, trying to use all the veggies from the veggie co-op, running the dishwasher,&nbsp;mopping the floor for the fiftieth time this week, because my 2 1/2 year old won't stop pitching his bowl of yogurt across the room ...   My other major stress-relief tactic has been criminalized as well. I've been informed that we are "hemorraghing financially," so the days sitting glued to my PC, surfing from Barnes and Noble to Overstock.com over to eBay, Banana Republic, Gap, Pottery Barn are&nbsp;over. Even my $4 books and $10 shirts. IT ALL MUST END.   Go&nbsp;to bed at a reasonable hour, eat every three hours during the day, drink 1/2 gallon of water a day, excercise, meditate, go to church&nbsp;...&nbsp; I know I need to do all these things. But sometimes even they are not enough to unstring my high strung resting metabolism. But WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?

      My husband and I are trying to have another child. We have two boys, ages 4 and 2 ½. Brian’s an only child, but he has aunts on both sides of his family with four children, all boys. We are the last hope of Brian’s 80-year-old Mémé, who loves her five grandsons but has six bags full of lace, floral fabrics, and pink and lavender yarn in her closet gathering moth eggs. None of her other grandchildren are married yet, and the pressure's on.  For my part, I do wish for a daughter. My mom has been so nurturing and has given me much sage advice over the years. I'd like to pass some of what I've learned from her on to a daughter of my own.  So, with our chances of having a girl looking to be about 2 percent, I ordered the book  How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby , by Landrum B. Shettles, M.D., Ph.D. After reading hundreds of pages of studies and evidence, statistical and anecdotal (and ad nauseam), I became convinced that we could increase our chances of conceiving a girl to at least 75 percent.  The catch? Persons wanting to conceive a girl must stop having sex two to three days BEFORE ovulation. Also, to increase the chances of conceiving a girl, the woman should not enjoy herself during intercourse. Is this irony?  So for the three months that we were advised to wait before trying again after my miscarriage, I carefully took my temperature every morning and monitored (brace yourself) my cervical mucus. Have you learned all about cervical mucus? It’s fascinating stuff.  I determined that I ovulate on day 12 or 13, but can’t figure any closer than that. We’ve tried and failed for two cycles now. All this trying and failing makes me realize that I want a baby, boy or girl, I just want a baby. This is a good thing.  But my husband, being the scientific and technical brainchild that he is, thinks we’ve finally got it all figured out, so why not try again? So this is it. We moved our last “try” in 12 hours closer to my estimated ovulation time, and now all we have to do is wait.  If it doesn't work this time, I think I've got to relinquish my illusion of control and just get on with the making of this baby. I can't wait for her, or him, to be here.

       In February, I knew what I was going to do this fall: Have a baby. But in March, I had a miscarriage. Then in May, I lost my newsletter job, which took me about four hours a week and paid well. About the same time, by babysitter told me that she has to quit in September, when her daughter goes to first grade.  Deciding to take the summer “off,” just worrying about me, my house and the kids for a few months, was easy. Deciding what to do this fall, not so much.  My four options are:  • Work at Williams-Sonoma. My friend works there during her summers off from teaching. I stopped in to see her, and mentioned that, in 11 years of marriage, my husband and I have not accumulated one piece of silver or china, table linens, or what one might term “serving ware.” She said I could work there for the holidays, and that Williams-Sonoma gives their employees a 40 percent discount(!).  Pro: The job would be stress free. No babysitter required, I'd work nights and weekends. Con: I’d be working at the mall, and might run in to former high school classmates.  Pro: I love the stuff Williams-Sonoma sells. Con: I’d spend all the money I earned on the stuff Williams-Sonoma sells.  • Write at home for a healthcare marketing firm. My former boss has been offering me writing work for YEARS. And I would be writing, professionally even.  Pro: I would earn a decent hourly wage. Con: I would have to hire a new babysitter. I HATE hiring new babysitters. Someday I’ll tell you all about it.  Pro: Since the firm has so much work, it could be a steady and varied writing gig for months or years to come. Con: Since I’m new at this type of writing (and since I have to hire a new sitter), the job would be stressful, with weekend-erasing deadlines and sleepless nights wondering if I can schedule my 10-year-old neighbor to watch my kids so I can work a few more hours. In terms of “no stress,” this would be a step backward.  • Work as a writing coach for an online writing program. One of my “dream lives” is to teach writing and write fiction myself. This would be a step in that direction.  Pro: Since I’ve never coached or taught or tutored writing before, this would be a resume builder. Con: Since I don’t own Adobe Acrobat, I would have to spend $350 to buy it before I could start work. I don’t have $350.  Pro: I could work from home for as little as five hours a week. Con: I could make, after taxes, as little as $6 an hour.  • Do nothing. Just take care of the kids, the house, and myself.  Pro: I’ve been debating home schooling, so this could be an opportunity to try it out. Con: We’ve already decided to send my oldest to school through kindergarten, to see how he does. So I could be losing my last few years to work before beginning home schooling.  Pro: I could spend a lot of time -- Monday to Friday, 7 am to 6:30 pm – with my kids. Con: See above.  These options are overshadowed by three things: • We’re broke. • I will most likely become pregnant sometime in the next six months. • I want a decent quality of life. I realize life can’t be no stress, but I don’t want to do something that will create unnecessary stress.  What I really want is for my babysitter not to quit, and for things to stay just as they are now. But since that’s just a dream, I’ve got to make a decision. The more I mull the options, the more I realize I have no idea what to do. And the longer I take making up my mind, the fewer options I will have.

      Recently, my friend Gina (www.mom-blog.com) wrote that she doesn’t have a nurturing instinct, or much of one. Sure, she soothes and mothers her baby girl. But nurturing her family does not come easily to her.  It doesn’t come easily to me, either.  When Oprah does a show on “Women Who Can’t Say No,” I turn it off, because I have no problem saying no. When my husband asks me to drop off the dry cleaning and I can’t, I say no.  In other words, I put myself first. Yet I still feel crappy, anxious, guilty... not as happy as I could be. I don’t like to play with my kids as much as I expected to. My husband and I have been, a little tense. Just the usual ups and downs.  But, I’ve had this nagging feeling that something is wrong.  I pulled a book off my shelf during No-Stress Week, Self-Nurture, by Alice Domar, Ph.D. Domar heads Harvard Medical School’s Mind-Body Center for Women’s Health at the Mind-Body Medical Institute. Her mentor is Herbert Benson, M.D, author of The Relaxation Response and a pioneer in the field of mind-body medicine.  In our stressful lives, Domar says, women “don’t have to stop soaring – in our creative imaginations, careers, sex lives, relationships, or spiritual endeavors. To take flight though, we must develop ... a ‘fierce and tender concern’ for every facet of our being. That,” she says, “... is what I call self-nurture.”  When we nurture ourselves, she claims, we become balanced among the chaos, more in control of our stress level, happier in life. As a byproduct of this inner peace, our nurturing of others flows more freely.  But when we’re chronically stressed, our levels of stress hormones stay high, giving us high blood pressure, a weakened immune system and “other imbalances that eventually lead to symptoms or even full-blown diseases.”  As low-key as I try to be, during a day with the kids my nerves get jangled. I get about 30 minutes of time to myself during the day (Thank God for TiVo). Nap time is key. John sleeps, Ben watches a video, the laundry’s in the dryer. But, what if John doesn’t go to sleep? Instead, he’s yelling, “Mommy! I got a POOOPEEEEE!”  Of course, I’ll recover. John will get up, and the dinner rush will commence. However, must I feel as if a tiger nearly attacked me just because John’s not going to nap today? Why do I get so stressed when Brian works late? I’ve learned being home with kids that you’ve got to roll with the punches. The pace is fast and priorities change minute-to-minute. If you asked me if Brian working late or John missing a nap stresses me out, I’d say no. Intellectually those things don’t bother me. Yet physically, they do.  Domar says the reason is chronic stress. She has counseled hundreds of women, from all walks of life, with similar complaints about their stress levels. She points out that, even among women who know about or use stress-relief tools like meditation, guided imagery or yoga, many still lack a “commitment to themselves that is rooted in compassion.”  Too often, my commitment to myself is rooted in perfectionism. I thought I’d beaten it (thanks to www.flylady.com). Yet, I’m still yearning, for a sense of peace and enjoyment -- heck, just a stable anxiety level. Now that I’m grown up, I know I cannot control events. Bad things happen every day, and some days life seems like one big dodged bullet. I’ll grow old fast if I keep worrying about it all. But on some level, I can’t stop.  I realize that all I want from life, all I’ve ever wanted, is to enjoy my day-to-day. Maybe this book holds the key.  Domar organized the book by seasons:  • Winter: Primal Self-Care • Spring: A Time for Renewal • Summer: Free Time for the Soul • Fall: Auspicious Beginnings  I started in Winter, even though it’s hot and humid here in New England. Somehow winter seems to fit. I guess anxiety has chilled my soul, and I need a big fluffy sweater.
