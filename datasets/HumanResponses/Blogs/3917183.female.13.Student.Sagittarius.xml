So i had to go when Rachel went to Work. Anywayz so i pretty much slept in a chair there (that big huge comfly one max alwayz sits in) and then i had a lesson most of wich (non jumping part) w/o stirrups cause Jess started talkin to someone and 4got bout us. What else is new though?!?!? well then after my lesson i had to wait for Rachel cause people were there t try Spider (rachels old horse) and then Kate asked me to work her shift (3-end) wich probly earned me bout 5 Dollars!!!!!!!!!!!! stupid rip off!! well round like 4:30 i get home bring in OUR horses then its shower time!!! Then me Rachel and Laura went off to the mall! ANd that alwayz puts me in a good mood! I got a shirt, slippers, shoes, a ton of necklacess and earings n junk like that OMG and i got this wicked cute scruncci that is pink and fluffy!! w00t for fluff!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then we came home and watched Donnie Darko again then..well...then it was nighty night time!!! i'll fill u in on today after the rest of tonights festivities!!
