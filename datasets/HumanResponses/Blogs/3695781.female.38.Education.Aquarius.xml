      Okay... so this is my first post.  I guess I'll tell a little about myself.  I'm married to a police officer,  we've been married for 17 years.  After 17 years of working nights,  he is finally working days and I can experience a real life.  It is nice not needing to check his schedule to see if we can get together for dinner,  catch a movie,  just about anything.  The down side is that he is not home for things like mid day dr appts and deliveries.  We have two kids,  a son who is 16 and works at a movie theater part time.  We love the free movies,  which saves us a ton of money since we tend to see a lot of movies.  Our son is very computer literate.  He is also very smart and I pray that he uses his smarts for good not evil...  just kidding... well, actually , I do hope that  but I'm not worried that he will do evil.  Oh,  I've read that many bloggers post in all lowercase w/o punctuation,  but that would just about kill me,  since I am a teacher,  so sorry for the correct punctuation and capitalization (most of the time) Our daugher is 14 and we worry more about her than our son.  He pretty much always plays by the rules,  our daughter never met a rule that couldn't be bent.  She does this very sweetly,  however.   So,  what about me?  Well,  I'm kind of introverted.  I like to be around people - I just don't like to have them in my house.  I like to hang out with people at school ,  or go out and meet up with a bunch of people,  talk with people at my church,  etc... but just not have people over,  I guess it's an invasion of my privacy or something,  plus,  if they are at my house,  I'm trapped to stay with them until they decide to go,  whereas if we're out somewhere,  I can go anytime I like. That's really the only strange thing about me... oh,  I lied... I'm also a major hypochondriac.  Mostly about cancer,  any time I have any pain ,  I'm  sure it's cancer of something.  I'm really bad about googling all the symptoms I have and finding out what great disease I have.  I'm a closet hypochoncriac, though,  because I don't go to the doctor much and I don't tell people about what I'm worried about because I don't want them thinking I'm a freak,  so I just worry about it and do my private research for a couple weeks and then forget about it until the next strange pain.  My husband has caught me a few times and just laughs at me.   SO,  when I'm not busy not inviting people over or researching cancer (I know about every symptom and cause there is) I'm busy reading or working in my garden.  Lately I've been reading mostly the bible.  I was raised Lutheran and just became a Baptist.  Yep,  I'm born again.   I was a pretty good Lutheran,  but I have a long way to go to be a good Baptist.  I haven't read the Bible in so long and many of the people in my small group can quote verses to back just about any statement they make.  So,  I've been doing a lot more reading and praying than I ever have.  I have to admit that I truly feel a greater sense of security,  comfort and purpose in my life.  ( but,  no,  you still cant come over for a coke - let's meet somewhere instead... ) Well,  I'm going to browse some other blogs now, I'm sure I'll think of something interesting to say next time... Happy Father's Day!

      Okay,  after I posted my last post,  I went to the gym. You see,  my 20 year class reunion is coming up in August.  I'd like to be 15 lbs thinner by then  and tanner probably use the white strips, too,  to erase years of coffee abuse.  my face is pretty much the same,  if not even better,  my hair still looks good. it's just the body thing. i've had two kids and some people i know have kids and their bodies still look perfect.  i'm not one of those.  my babies were BIG and i've got the stretch marks to prove it. i also gained way too much weight both times.  pregnancy was a license to eat everything i wanted and just say that i had a craving.  well,  40 and 50 lbs later,  the craving turned into unwanted stretch marks.  i try to reason, though,  what if i had watched what i ate for 9 months and STILL got stretch marks?  huh?  what then?  i would have missed a whole nine months of indulging my every food fantasy.  well,  maybe that's going overboard,  but in the long run,  i'd probably do it the same way again.   anyhoo,  since the kids are 16 and 14,  I guess i can't blame the weight on pregnancy,  so off to the gym for me.  i've got 6 weeks to lose 15 lbs.  it's doable if i really watch what i eat - low carb all the way - and hit the gym religiously.  the question is ???? how bad do i want this????  what am i trying to prove?  who am i trying to impress?  what is my motivation?  I haven't seen most of these people since our 10 year reunion.  so i don't care - but i must admit that it would be nicer for people to be thinking 'damn, she still looks good!' instead of '20 years really kicked her in the ass'  so,  at the gym i did the elliptical (spelling is not a strong point) for only 20 - but i've been away from the gym for 4 months and 20 minutes felt a long shot longer.  the machine claims i burned 200 calories,  so i'll take it's word for it.  i also did 100 various stomach exercises.  i did 40 leg raises on the roman chair and 60 crunches on the cable machine.  i could really feel my abs burn.  then,  to even it out i did 30 rows and 16 lat pull downs.  then i did this exercise i kinda made up for my obliques,  i hold a 30 lb weight and lean over to the side and stand straight again.  i did those 20 times.  they are like weighted side bends.  i aint tellin what  i ate today.  that will be my biggest challenge is to stop being a piggy.  so,  it's in writing - i am formally on a get fit program.  just call me the swan.... :|
