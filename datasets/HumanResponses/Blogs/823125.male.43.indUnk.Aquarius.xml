      he he got a bit caried away last night :)  me and my co trek nutter tom decided last night we'd it down and work out a list of equipment we would need for the walking part of the trek . several coffes and hours later we find out its now 8am and weve been up all night oh dear LOL not to wory nether of us had work today so nop problems there .  We're going to change the name of the trek to the wls info trek to have some continutiy with the wls info site, a very good idea that ken  pointed out to us :) thanks for that matey and were haveing a rethink on the logo to make it more printer friendly .  another thing we need to do is have a chat with ken about one of the pages too. tehhow can you help one, im thuinking it might be a good idea to put 2 forms on theere one where people can donate directly to the charity via pay pal and another where people can print out a form and post it in to us with a cheq.  also may be a downloadablwe sponsor form, but im not to sure about that one  it might be open to abuse.  soon as all thats sorted well get the website live. and once thats up the leter wrighting can begin  how am i today TIRED LOL !!!

Big thanks to ken for all the help and suport he's given us not least in setting up these bloggs for us , ken you are an absolute star matey .  Theres so much stuff to do over the next nine months at the moment its all seeming a little daunting but we are gettign there and getting a game plan organised. The website is almost complete and once it has the ok from ken and the other wls guys it will go live at  urlLink www.wlstrek.co.uk  Huge thanks to Dave my other half for that , when it comes to web design hes second to none :).  After a good deal of debating we decided it would be beter to cycle from lands end to john o groats insted of the other way round its not such a harsh start going that way , hehe it meens we dont have a 1000ft clime on day one (phewwwwwwww) :)  Im waiting on maps ariving , but i have the iocknield way section broken down into 7 ,1 day sections, just waiting on the angles way , ridge way , wessex ridgeway and southwest costal paths to arive and ill get craking on them :)  Ill get all the routs posted in detail on the web site as soon as poss, then its time for me to start wrighting letters asking for suport from companies and celebs, and seeing if any one will donate stuff for the charity auction , if you no of any one who could help please email in to let us no or point them at the website once it goes live , thanks guys . Infact if youd like to help ,or if you fancy joining us for part of the trek or indeed all of it we would love to have you come join us , even if its just to cheer us on , wright a few letters or run about with a sponser form :) . just send in an email to let us no :)  How am i feeling at the moment he he half excited about this and half a litle daunted by it all (the walk and teh cycle are the least scarey parts LOL ) but as i say not in a bad way , ive got great people on board helping, were a wls trek team and a flipping good one at that he he we are off with a vengance and i for one cant wait :) big hugz guys charlie
