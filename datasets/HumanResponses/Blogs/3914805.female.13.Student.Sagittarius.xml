      Well It was the last day of school today oh my fucking god how good does that make me feel!?!? well i'll answer your question...Fan-Fucking-Tastic!! I got home at half 1 and just blasted my music so so loud!&nbsp;mother's getting really scared about sprog who's on its way anytime within the next week (bound to happen the night of heidi's sleepover). i buggered off up the hill with Emma and Dave and&nbsp;i was unbeleiveably hyper when they got to my house. when we got up the hill i couldn't stop thiking about Darren and how i havn't seen him in a week and two days (sad i know but i did)&nbsp; and i think that he's avoiding me becuase well...he hasnt botherd arranging anything... texting him is like texting no one, i'll never get an answer. Kerry has no credit either so he can't contact me through that.anyway, dave emz and i have decided to make a film. a random scary/arty one. its gunna b like a summer prodject thinggy :D. anyway we left the hill and went bak 2 emue's place. we got a shit load of sweets nd redbull and ate them there. david walkd along emma's slippery floor and skidded only to smack into the bed jolt all the redbull up and crack up laughing. he turnd round and went "i didn't spill!!! no wait....yer i did..." it was the most halarious thing i've seen all day!!!!! he's such a funny dude and is SOOOOO going out with Emma in secret... hehheh... Well theres not much i can say now. Over And Out.

      Its halfway through august and i havn't writen once! oh the neglect. i feel kinda crappy 'cause that bitch Malaina got wrid of Adam on the Adverage Joe and went for the stupid mode!! Oh what a shallow bitch ..AND he was rich 2!!!! shes a freek. oh well, SORRY ADAM!!!  David slept round last night and we slept in the tent which was kind of fun. we spent all fucking day searching for a sodding tent and then emma wasn't allowed to come! it sucked but we had a good time anyway. even tho i woke up and dave was staring at me nd it made me jump like a frog on stilts! and he prodded me...:@.  Well... just to update you lovly people. Darren dumped me...AGAIN. I agree that it wasn't working 'cause we didn't see each other because he was always at work. but he has a nerve to ask for me back and then do it again 2 say "we can be friends but we shouldn't go out for now, maybe when we both have more time" whatever the fuck that meens, i tried 2 meet him about 6 times but he never showed up once! so it wasn't my fault at all. Well...screw him, my daddy has a hottub now...so he's missing out on some fun oppertunities there!!! mwahaha.  David's sleeping round Dad's tomorrow and we're going to go in the hot tub which should be cool. maybe i can have a hot tub party with Emma Dave and Sara when everyone has time. That would be fucking awsome! I'm going to put some pictures of me and some friends and things i like sometimes soon. so don't hessitate to look at those!!!!!! Over And Out.
