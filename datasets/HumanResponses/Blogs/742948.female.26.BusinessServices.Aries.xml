      I have a mild case of sleep deprivation today.  I stayed up until after 3 AM ("its 3AM, I must be lonely…") last night.  Not sure why.  I just could  not  get to sleep.  To try to put myself to sleep, I foolishly started reading  Return of the King , the last book in the  urlLink Lord of the Rings  trilogy.  Silly me.  I couldn't put it down!  Luckily, I only had 60 or so pages before I finished.  Phew!  I could have been up all night.  I digress - lack of sleep makes me tend to lose my concentration.    I made a comment in the kitchen at work today that I wish I could take back.  I owe it all to sleep deprivation.  Someone was talking about how gross it was that someone put chicken bones in the garbage disposal.  I uttered the first words that came to mind, "At least its not a human hand."      What the…?    Yes, it's true.  The words went straight from my brain to my mouth without stopping in between to make sure it would be okay with me if it came out of my mouth.  It even came out in a creepy, horror movie sort of voice.  I need some sleep.

      I very nearly shit my pants when I saw a commercial this evening for Mike Myers' new movie  urlLink  Austin Powers in Goldmember  .  One of the characters  VERY  closely resembles an unsightly being that I had the unfortunate experience of interacting with in college -  urlLink The Mole .  Those of you who were in  urlLink Pi Nu  with me will know  exactly  who I am referring to here.    I can't wait to see the movie.  I'm sure that every  mole  reference made in the movie will be incredibly similar to anything and everything that anyone ever  wanted  to say to her, but never had the audacity to put into words...

      I went to  urlLink Borders  today to pick up a  urlLink book  for work.  I ended up not getting the  urlLink book for work , but rather walked away with a copy of  A History of Western Music, Fifth Edition .  It was on the bargain shelf for $7.99, and I just couldn't pass that up!  What does this mean, though?  I have now become one of those people that: a.) shops for bargain books b.) buys books that will sit on my book shelf in perpetuity, collecting dust c.) buys books that are meant to be read for education rather than for pleasure  In short,  I'm turning into my mother!

      Cats are interesting animals.  They lounge around the house all day, basking in the sunlight as it filters through the living room windows.  They chase shadows (sometimes ceaselessly).  Laser pointers fascinate them.    One thing I find particularly interesting about cats is their reaction to  Nepeta cataria L., aka catnip.    Catnip, a member of the mint family, is a harmless "high" for felines. Although many cats will eat it, scientists say they're reacting to the smell rather than the taste. Felines bite, chew, rub against, and roll in catnip to release the volatile oil trapped in the leaves. Catnip is harvested when this essential oil production reaches its peak, and leaves and fragrant flowers are carefully air-dried to preserve essential oils at their best.   About 80% of adult cats -- including lions, pumas, and leopards! -- react to this irresistible, intoxicating, analgesic soporific. The tendency to like or ignore catnip is inherited, and it's true that some cats are immune to its influence.   Of particular interest is the fact that humans can use catnip, as well.   Taken as a hot infusion, Catnip promotes sweating and is beneficial for colds, flus, fevers, and infectious childhood diseases. It is soothing to the nervous system and calming to the stomach. It aids with flatulence, diarrhea, and colic. It is sometimes used as an enema to cleanse and heal the lower bowel (use in diluted form). Catnip helps to prevent miscarriage and premature birth as well as allays morning sickness.   So the next time the doctor suggests you get an enema, be sure to ask if he recommends catnip for the cleansing of your lower bowel area.

      My youngest brother, Joshua (he's 15), recently bought a  urlLink Hobie Cat  sailboat off of  urlLink eBay .  This is no ordinary  urlLink Sunfish  sailboat, my friends.  This is   hardcore   sailing.  Here's the scoop.  Joshua got involved in sailing a few years ago at the urging of some family friends.  Since he was working for Dad last summer, he had some money saved up and decided to buy a sailboat.  I guess he found this boat on eBay, and went ahead and bought it.  The catch: the boat was in New Hampshire.  Mom and Dad (and the rest of my family) live in Pennsylvania.  South central Pennsylvania, to be a little more precise.  The part of New Hampshire where the boat was located is approximately 13 hours away from my parents' house.  Lucky for Joshua, our brother Jeremy was graduating from OIS on Saturday, so Mom and Dad would at least be in New England.  Since they're such great parents, they agreed to drive up to New Hampshire from Newport, Rhode Island after Jeremy's graduation.  Little did they know what was in store for them.  After having lunch with Jeremy and Elizabeth after graduation, Mom and Dad followed me back to my house in the van, so we could drop my car off before heading up to pick up the boat.  Perhaps I should give a little more detail about the van - it's my dad's work van.  Its probably about 15 ft long (if that), and has only 2 seats.  There were 3 of us riding in it.  How do you fit 3 people in a van that has only two seats?  It's known as a bucket seat, my friends.  As in an empty five-gallon bucket turned upside-down.  With a cushion on top.  How comfortable!  Normally, the trip from Boston to the area of New Hampshire to which we were traveling would take approximately 2 hours.  We didn't take into account that half of the city of Boston travels to New Hampshire on Friday afternoon.  Stop and go traffic is not fun, no matter which way you look at it.  Its especially  not  fun on a make-shift bucket seat.  When we finally reached our destination (a private lake in New Hampshire, right on the border with Maine), it was approximately 6:30, and it looked like rain.  We didn't think the rain would be a big deal, since we didn't expect that it would be too hard to load the boat onto Dad's trailer.  Riiiiight.   This boat is 16 feet long with a 25 foot mast.     At first Dad didn't think we'd be able to transport the thing.  Period.  Luckily Mom and I were able to talk him into it - Joshua would have been one unhappy teenager if they showed up in Pennsylvania without that  urlLink Hobie Cat .  If it weren't for Dad's van, and all of the tools that he had with him, there's no way in hell we could have taken that boat with us.  The mast was lashed to one of the ladders Dad had on the roof rack.  The pontoons were attached to the roof rack, as well.  Thank goodness Dad also had the foresight to bring his 10 foot trailer with him.  Without that, there's no way he could have carried the mast - it stuck out behind the truck approximately 8 feet, barely shorter than the length of the truck and trailer combined.  The trampoline was then attached to the trailer.    The whole process, from deciding whether or not we were even going to take the damned thing, to actually disassembling it and attaching each part to the truck or trailer, took a little over two hours.  Oh, and did I mention the mosquitoes?  Aside from the accommodations, the trip wasn't too bad.  My parents are great to hang out with, and I haven't laughed that hard in a LONG time.  Its amazing how cool your parents become after you move out of the house.  The best part of the story, however, is that Joshua now has a kick ass boat.  Oh yeah, I'd also like to mention that he paid $515 for a boat that would cost $7,500 new.  That's a 93.1% discount!!

      For those of you who have checked out  urlLink KnockOnWoody.com , here is a message from the man himself:   KnockOnWoody.com readers,   For those of you who still read the website I once updated on a weekly basis, you know that my column production has trailed off. This is due to an increased workload here at The Ad Agency. I have made a mid-year resolution to get back into the writing habit and I appreciate all your emails encouraging me to do so. In fact, I have recently posted a new column which I hope you enjoy.   The main reason I am writing though is because I have decided to password protect my website to keep my co-workers from reading it. While 99.99% of my company has no idea that I have a website, think about how much you would love to read stories about your boss getting drunk and how quickly that website name would circulate around! So, with that in mind, from now on you can log in using the following login and password:    login: beer  password: please    All lowercase letters. I will be changing the password link often just to be tricky so always log in through the main site at Knockonwoody.com. Please pass this login and password on to anyone you know that reads my website that might not be on my emailing list, but none of my co-workers please. duh.   Just to be clear, there hasn't been an issue with my website and my work, but this is just a precautionary measure. You can never be too safe with your diary...even if hundreds of other people are reading it.   Thanks and enjoy the rest of your summer,  Woody   www.knockonwoody.com

      Last night I had the opportunity to go to Fenway Park for  urlLink A Tribute to Ted Williams .  It was truely awesome.  Many big names from baseball's golden days were present: Dom DiMaggio, Carl Yastrzemski, Johnny Pesky.  Senator John Glenn was also present.  Senator Glenn flew with Mr. Williams during the Korean War.    All were there to celebrate the life of the great  urlLink Ted Williams .

      I've spent the majority of today adding pictures to my Ofoto website of  urlLink Jeremy's OIS graduation  and of  urlLink Mom & Dad's visit to Boston .  While waiting for the pictures to upload (approximate time: 4 hours, 22 minutes), I continued to read  Return of the King , the third book in the   urlLink Lord of the Rings   trilogy.  When  The Two Towers  comes out in theaters this winter, you can bet that I'll be there on opening night!

      The world's largest flower, the Titan Arum, is blooming at the  urlLink Quail Botanical Gardens  in California.  What is  particularly  interesting about this flower is its latin name -  Amorphophallus titanum , which, loosely translated, means "giant shapeless phallus".  One look at this  urlLink flower , and you'll know how it got its name.

      My brother Jeremy is graduating from  urlLink Officer Indoctrination School  at the Newport Naval Base in Newport, Rhode Island.  After he's done in Newport, he'll be heading to Washington, DC before he heads to Pittsburgh, PA for 6 months of training for his job with the Navy.  He's going to be a nuclear propulsion engineer.  Sorry, I can't help you - I don't know what it means, either.   Let me give you a little bit of background on Jeremy.  He spent 3 years at  urlLink Shippensburg University  in Shippensburg, PA.  From there, he transferred to  urlLink Penn State University  in State College, PA.  He graduated from both Penn State and Shippensburg this past May.  His degree from Penn State is a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering.  His degree from Shippensburg is a Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics.  He graduated from Penn State with  Highest Distinction , and graduated  summa cum laude  from Shippensburg.  This is one smart cookie we're talking about here.  Needless to say, I'm incredibly proud of my little brother, Jeremy.  I'll write about my other siblings soon.  They're just as awesome as Jeremy!

      The receptionist in our office is one of the most incompetent people on the planet.  She on vacation for two weeks, and in her absence, we employed a temp.  The saying "You never know what you have until its gone" works in the other direction, as well - You never know what you don't have until you get it.  Or something like that.  At any rate, our receptionist   sucks  !  She has no working knowledge of computers.  Period.  I don't even know if she knows how to turn one on.  She doesn't know how to empty the fax machine, either.  Apparently that's someone else's job.  I saw the chairman of the company looking for one of his faxes the other day.  Hmmm...  Isn't that generally viewed upon as being a job function of a receptionist?  Not here!!  Forget about ordering office supplies - we're better off walking a few blocks to Staples, picking out what we want, then submitting the receipt ourselves than asking  her  to order anything for us.  Even if the item number is written out in block lettering, she still manages to fuck it up.  Let's talk about the mail for a minute.  The mail gets delivered around 10AM.  It generally gets delivered to everyone's inbox between 3PM and 4PM.   What is the delay here???   Its also rare for me to actually get my own mail.  It usually belongs to someone in the office space across the hall.  Getting my own mail was a delight last week with the wonderful temp (who, by the way, could generate labels in Word when asked).  As defined by  urlLink Webster's dictionary , the word  receptionist  is a noun that refers to a person employed to greet telephone callers, visitors, patients, or clients.  In the literal sense of the word, this woman does a mediocre, at best, job.  In the present day sense of the word, she's the worst I've ever seen.

      Get this.   urlLink This  pisses me off.  There is to be a new character added to the  urlLink Sesame Street  lineup - a character that is HIV-positive.  What exactly is to be accomplished by this?  I suppose the next new character will have the clap or something equally repulsive.    When I was young, my parents limited my television watching to mostly  urlLink Sesame Street  and  urlLink Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood , both of which were educational and fun to watch.  At the time I hated it, but looking back, its a good thing that I wasn't allowed to watch a lot of TV when I was a kid.  The stuff that is on TV today would have fucked me up when I was a kid.  I guess my kids will have to settle for  urlLink Blue's Clues  and reruns of  urlLink Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood .

      The Penguin is at it again.  Today she's wearing a shirt with a giant strawberry in the middle.  Its hard enough not to notice her gigantic torpedo tits, but now we have to endure this enormous strawberry on top of it.  I think while she was getting her MBA, she also got her doctorate in How to Annoy the Shit Out of Co-Workers.  Today is shaping up to be no exception.    One of our  urlLink software applications  allows only 6 users to be logged in at one time.  The Penguin was complaining that someone kicked her out so that they could get in - the complaining lasted about 20 minutes.  I'm not joking.  Here's the kicker.   After the bitch session was over, she sat down at her desk and promptly started reading the society page of the  urlLink Boston Globe  .

      I work with old people.  We're not talking people who are my parents' age, either - these people are ANCIENT!  In an office of 30 employees, more than half are over the age of 60.  Needless to say, taking a position with this company didn't improve my social life.  Have you ever noticed how much fun it is to compare people to movie characters?  For example, there's a hideous woman that I work with who greatly resembles Chester Cobblepot (aka: The Penguin).  Scary, but true.  She's got the hook nose and bad teeth and everything.  She even waddles - well, sort of.  On top of all that, she's a pain in the ass to work with.  She's got these nervous ticks that make everyone around her nervous.  And she stutters when she gets flustered.  There's a lot more I could say about her, but I'll save that for another time.  We've also got Yoda working here.  This guy has the button nose, hair, and when he talks, its just as cryptic as Master Yoda.  I watched Star Wars: Episode II with some of my co-workers, and we all agreed: the resemblance is amazing.

      Fellow  urlLink Pi Nu ers, you will find the following particularly interesting, given its reference to a former Council member, and the fact that its the hometown of my former psycho roommate.  Chad and Wendy, I think you might know who I mean here:    PA BOROUGH HAS NO BAN ON BACKYARD BURIAL  By Associated Press, 8/27/02   RED LION, Pa. — There's no law in this eastern Pennsylvania borough to prevent residents from burying dead loved ones in their backyards, and a local official wants to know if they want that to change.   The borough council plans to discuss an ordinance that would prohibit human burials on property other than established cemeteries. The public will get a chance to comment on the proposal during a Sept. 9 meeting.   Solicitor Michael Craley raised the idea of a home-burial ban. There is no state law prohibiting home burials but the state borough code does allow municipalities to ban the practice if they wish, he said.   The borough has no law to regulate home burials in any way, zoning officer Lynn Rinehart said.   Officials said they did not know how often home burials occur in the borough.    P.S.  I found this on  urlLink Boston.com  in the Odds & Ends section.  Fitting, isn't it?

      Does anyone else think that The Improper Bostonian  should have a website?  For those of you that don't have the unique pleasure of living in the city of Boston,  The Improper Bostonian  is a bi-weekly publication that highlights upcoming festivities, events, and general interesting goings-on in and around the city of Boston.  There is usually a theme to each issue, as well as regular columns.    One of my favorites is the Improper Impersonals.  This section allows anonymous readers the chance to tell that special someone that they have a secret crush on them.  Some Bostonians use the impersonals section as a sounding board to vent their frustrations at other Bostonians - usually its drivers pissed off at pedestrians, or vice versa.  Alas, until  Improper  gets wired, Boston residents will have to be satisfied with the  urlLink arts and entertainment  section of  urlLink Boston.com  for up-to-the-minute information about cultural events in the area...

      I'm in a funk.    I can't quite put my finger on what is causing me to remain in this funk, nor can I identify what put me in the funk to begin with.  I think it began when my boss came back from her maternity leave.  A lot of her responsibilities fell on my shoulders while she was gone, and now I'm not quite sure which, if any, of those responsibilities I will be retaining. It really hasn't been brought up.  Its bugging me to no end!  I know I need to approach her with this, but I'm not quite sure how to do it.  The fact that I'm 24 years old doesn't help.  While she was gone it appeared as though the old farts that I work for actually wanted to hear what I had to say.    I was obviously mistaken.  I'll just have to figure out a way to bring this topic up to her - the topic of my job description.    Fun.  Don't mind me - I'll be myself in a few days.  My brother Jason and my cousin Lee are planning a visit to Boston this weekend!  WOO-HOO!!

      I got a blast from the past earlier this week.  Shauna Colegrove called me.  All you  urlLink Pi Nu ers out there may remember Shauna.  She fell off the face of the earth somewhere around December 1999.  Well, she's alive and well.  She lives in Frederick, MD, and she found my cell phone number in an old address book of hers.  I cannot express the shock at getting a phone call from her.  Up until Wednesday night, I thought there was a distinct possibility that she really was MIA.  As it turns out, she's working for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, and is engaged to an alcoholic.  Some things never change.  While it was good to hear from her, I'm sorry to report that she's still the same old Shauna.  Pretty much everyone that I keep in touch with from college has moved on from the small town mindset (regardless of whether they actually live in a small town), and have begun to function normally with the rest of the world.  This is not the case with Shauna.  She's the same as ever - same small-town mindset.    Thank God I don't live in Shippensburg anymore.

      I'm  SO  exited about the season premier of   urlLink Friends   tonight!  Will Joey tell Rachel that he's not really proposing?  I'm just ready for some all-new laughs - I could use them right now…  Speaking of laughs, I rented the funniest movie over the weekend -   urlLink The Sweetest Thing  .  Ladies, if you haven't seen this one yet, clear your schedule for about 2 hours this weekend and prepare to laugh your ass off.   Oh and one more thing - I haven't seen the cinema version, but the unrated version is hilarious.

      While sitting in the choir loft at  urlLink Newton Presbyterian Church  on Sunday morning, I figured out where I'm going to get married, and how I want the wedding to be decorated, who's going to be there, etc.  The hard part is going to be finding that special someone to share in my dream wedding.  I've never been much of a girly-girl.  I grew up throwing a baseball around with my dad, and running through the mud with my brothers.  My sister was the one who was always playing with  urlLink Barbie  - I preferred  urlLink He-Man .  I suppose that's why every eligible bachelor I get to know tells me that I'm "too good of a friend for us to start dating."  I think that's their nice way of telling me - "No way, chica."  *sigh*

He’s been to his second interview with  urlLink Harsco Corporation , and he’s feeling pretty good about the interviews.  Hopefully he’ll get a job there.    The  really  interesting part is that the subsidiary to which he’s applying is  urlLink Taylor-Wharton .  According to the website, their “ vast product offering includes: cryogenic bulk and high purity tanks, liquid nitrogen refrigerators, dewars and freezers; beverage carbonation/CO 2 tanks; high pressure and acetylene cylinders; and liquid cylinders for a wide variety of industrial gases ”.  Have we finally discovered the brains behind  urlLink Austin Powers  frozen hibernation process?  Something to ponder…

      This just in:    Nation gets free tacos if Taco Bell target is hit   By Associated Press, 10/22/02   SAN FRANCISCO -- Barry Bonds could end up feeding the nation during this World Series.  Taco Bell is promising free tacos for the entire country if Bonds, or any other player, hits a target floating in a cove behind the right-field fence at Pacific Bell Park.  The 15-foot diameter target will remain in place through Game 5. Any home run that touches it during the three games scheduled at the park entitles everyone in the United States to a free taco coupon.  The company says it would pick a window of time on one day when people can redeem the coupons.  Of the 27 home runs to land in McCovey Cove since the park opened, Bonds has hit 21 of them for the San Francisco Giants. His team faces the Anaheim Angels on Tuesday in Game 3.  Taco Bell sponsored a similar promotion last year, offering free tacos to the country if the Mir space station hit the company's 40-foot-by-40-foot target in the South Pacific.  Mir finished the day 0-1.

      Here’s a log of what I did today:   3:00AM  Wake up in a panic, thinking Mom & Dad have overslept, and I’m going to miss my flight back to Boston.   3:15AM   Realize that I’m mistaken in thinking everyone overslept, but now I can’t get back to sleep.   3:23AM   Check online to see if my flight is on time.  According to the  urlLink US Airways website , everything is on time.   4:38AM   Dad and I make our first attempt to head to the airport, but are stopped short in our tracks due to the large amount of snow in the driveway.   4:39AM   Dad gets some wood ashes from the wood stove, and  Voila! : we have made it out of the driveway.   4:40AM to 5:20AM   Every muscle in my body is tensed up as Dad and I try not to get stuck in any snow drifts, and at the same time avoid oncoming traffic in the middle of a white out.  You’d be surprised how many people are on the road at that time of day.   5:21AM   We get on the PA turnpike, and its like a different world – do they heat that road or something?  There was absolutely   NO   snow to be seen on the road.  Anywhere.   6:05AM   Arrive at Harrisburg International Airport (which, by the way, is the smallest international airport I’ve ever seen.  Its international because they have airlines that fly to Canada from there…).   6:07AM   Attempt to check in at the US Airways E-Ticket Check-In Kiosk.     6:07AM and 11 seconds   Attempt to check in at the US Airways E-Ticket Check-In Kiosk fails because the flight that was still on schedule at 3:23AM has since been   cancelled  .   6:30AM   Get checked in for a flight to Boston by way of La Guardia.  Apparently that flight was delayed for an hour (should have left at 6:10) due to one of the crew being stuck in the snow.   7:20AM   Depart for La Guardia.  The connecting flight to Boston doesn’t leave New York until 10AM.  Plenty of time.  Right.  I'll give you the rest of the story later....

      Found on  urlLink Yahoo! :    Swingers Club Shut Because Moaning Too Loud   BERLIN (Reuters) - A swingers club in Berlin has been forced to shut because a court ruled that members' moans and shrieks of pleasure broke noise regulations.   Partner-swapping customers at the ground-floor club called "Zwielicht" -- a German word meaning both "twilight" and "dubious" -- upset those living upstairs, a Berlin court ruled this week.   "There are other clubs and brothels in this area and the customers there don't make so much noise. They are more discreet," a court spokeswoman said Wednesday.   An additional problem was that Zwielicht offered a limousine service to ferry its members to and from affiliated clubs.   "Cars came and went, doors were slammed and people talked loudly outside on the street," the spokeswoman said.   Berlin actress Anouschka Renzi, who lives above the club, told the court she was tired of seeing men wearing only bathrobes getting out of limousines on their way into the club.   "This is not a red-light district," she said.   Shit.  There goes my vacation getaway for the spring!!

      Here are some fun facts about how the avocado industry benefits from the Superbowl. All statistics provided by the good folks at  urlLink FoxSports :    Some facts about avocados   Just off a stretch of Southern California interstate called the Avocado Highway, work crews in the U.S. avocado capital are harvesting fist-sized fruits destined to be mashed and mixed by football fans across the country.   Super Bowl Sunday has become one of the biggest days for U.S. avocado consumption as the popularity of its zesty dip derivative, guacamole, has spread. Here are some little known facts about avocadoes ...   •  California supplies 86 percent of U.S.-grown avocados.  •  San Diego County supplies 46 percent of California-grown avocados.  •  Most California avocados are harvested on 60,000 acres between San Luis Obispo and the Mexican border.  •  An estimated 40 million pounds of avocados will be eaten during Super Bowl-related festivities.  •  Avocados are consumed in nearly 45 percent of U.S. homes; in the West the portion is 80 percent.  •  Seven varieties of avocado are grown in California, with Hass avocados making up 85 percent of the volume.  •  Avocados belong to the genus Persea, a member of the Lauraceae family.

      As  urlLink Wendy  so kindly pointed out, I have been  incredibly  delinquent in posting to this blog.  Please accept my humble apologies.  To try and win back the respect and admiration of all 2 of my readers, here's some distressing news about my favorite source of  urlLink potassium :   Bananas' Days May Be Numbered, Scientist Says Wed Jan 15, 3:34 PM ET  LONDON (Reuters) - It is one of the world's favorite fruits, but the banana hasn't had sex in years and its days may be are numbered.  Without scientific help the sterile, seedless fruit could disappear with 10 years, according to a Belgian plant pathologist.   Emile Frison, the head of the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain in Monpellier, France, said the fruit lacks the genetic diversity to fight off diseases and pests that are plaguing banana plantations and only biotechnology and genetic manipulation may be able to save it.   "Frison sees it as the only hope for the banana," New Scientist said on Wednesday.  "Without assistance banana production could drop and mark the beginning of the end of the fruit."  "We may even see the extinction of the banana as both a lifesaver for hungry and impoverished Africans and as the most popular product on the world's supermarket shelves," the magazine added.

      I hope everyone had a great New Year’s celebration!  Becki (old roommate) and her boyfriend Phil were here, and we had a lot of fun.  As usual on New Year's Eve, I got way too drunk, and don't remember much of what happened after we left Michi's (Boston friend) place.  5 of us left her apartment around 11:15 to go to Boston Harbor to see the fireworks in the fog.  It was fun, and I was incredibly intoxicated...  Becki tells me I kissed some guy with a video camera, and on the bus on the way home, I had a conversation with some Israeli guy about nuclear armament in North Korea.  Oh yeah, and I tried to give some Irish guys egg nog on the subway.  So now I'm trying to figure out why I act like such a jackass when I get severely intoxicated.  Granted, much of the greater population act like jackasses when they get as intoxicated as I was, but this has only started happening to me over the past few years.  I guess it didn't start until after I graduated from college.  I used to be this happy-go-lucky drunk that would make people laugh with my silliness, rather than make people stare in shock with my bitterness, and mean, nasty comments.  I think I pissed off half of the people at Michi's house, because I was just being cruel.  While I was recovering from my hangover yesterday, I was pondering this change for the worse, and I think I've discovered the answer: I'm angry.  I don't know why I'm angry, and I don't think I'm angry at anyone in particular.  I've just become an angry person.  I guess the next step is to try to figure out why I've gotten like this, and then try to fix it.  So I guess now I’ve found my New Year’s resolution:  Get back to the June of the mid-to-late-90s.  I’ll let you know how it works out.

      Well, its 1 AM, and for the fourth night in a row, I'm not able to get to sleep before 12:30.  Does anyone have any suggestions to help me sleep?  Beer just isn't working.  I'm on my third Rolling Rock of the evening.  I think its this damned new computer I bought.  I get home from work and immediately jump on this thing, log on to the internet (to chat with ex-boyfriends - v. bad idea!) or continue to do work that I didn't feel like finishing at the office.  Am becoming a workoholic.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Can you tell I'm reading  Bridget Jones ?  Note the bad grammar and excessive use of 'v's when describing things.  I'm going on a road trip tomorrow.  Alas, I'll be making yet another trip southbound alone.  I kind of like driving by myself.  It gives me lots of time to just think.  When I'm not shouting at other drivers, that is.  I really can't get over how many bad drivers there are out there.  I like to think of myself as a defensive driver.  That's not to say that I'm an asshole on the road - quite the contrary, in fact.  I'm constantly on the alert for what I like to call The Butthole Drivers.  Those who drive around with their heads up their ass.  There's a whole hell of a lot of them out there.  If they don't live in Massachusetts, they live in New Jersey.   I hate New Jersey.   As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing that ever came out of New Jersey was Bon Jovi.  And my friend Kristen's husband.  That's about it.  Speaking of Kristen, one of the reasons I'm taking this road trip is to head to College Park, MD (yes, Wendy, the home of the horrible Terps) to help Kristen celebrate her 26th birthday.  Friend Becky (not to be confused with Cousin Becky and Roommate Becki) and I are going to hang out with the Miller (that's Kristen) in Maryland tomorrow - or rather tonight - night.  Should be a good time.  The last time just the three of us went out was...  Shit - I can't remember when.  I have a great picture of the three of us at Kristen's bachelorette party in NYC.  That was 3 years ago.  WOW!  Anyhow, should be a good time.  Perhaps now would be a good time to attempt to differentiate between the Becky(i)s. - Cousin Becky is my second cousin on my father's side.  She's been married for (*gasp*) almost two years.  She and her husband Joshua live in Indianapolis and are expecting their first child in the beginning of May.  She and our second cousin Sara and I were pretty much the best of friends while we were growing up.  Cousin Becky was born six months before Sara and Sara was born six months before me.  Cousin Becky used to call me Little Baby June when we were little.  High school was a lot of fun.  If you ever meet Cousin Becky or Sara, be sure to ask them about the time we all watched  Untamed Heart  with Christian Slater and Marisa Tomei.  All I have to say is - he gave her the records *sniff, sniff*!  - Friend Becky has been a good friend since we sat next to each other in Mrs. Ebersole's English class in 8th grade.  She once wrote me a note during study hall that was all pictures.  Each picture represented a word - the first letter of that word was a letter in the word that she was writing.  For example, the word 'shit' would have been represented by a sheep, a house, an igloo and a turtle.  Very complex and rather confusing.  You can imagine how much fun it is to hang out with Friend Becky.  She is now married with two children, and lives in Fayetteville - she didn't stray too far from home.  - Roommate Becki is the Becki that spells her name with an 'i' - obviously.  She and I met while I was working for Financial Trust (which then became Keystone Financial which then became M&T Bank - bastards) in the Shippensburg Office.  The first time we worked together was the week before Spring Fest 1997.  We became fast friends after that, and the rest is history.  Some of my favorite memories with Roommate Becki happened while we were living together in a kickass apartment on the corner of Prince and Orange Streets in Shitten - I mean Shippensburg.  We used to go out to the bars together, stumble home at different times, and when one of us woke up, we'd stumble into the other's room, fall on the bed, and try to remember what happened the night before.  This was an almost nightly practice.  Ah, the good old days.  Here's a tidbit - I'm 47 days older than Roommate Becki.  During this road trip, I'll get to hang out with Friend Becky on Friday night, Cousin Becky on Saturday afternoon for her baby shower, and Roommate Becki on Sunday afternoon at the mini birthday celebration my parents are holding for me.  In case you were curious, my 25th birthday is on the 29th of March.  Be sure to mark your calendars.  On top of the fact that my car insurance rates will drop, I'll also be able to rent a car hassle free.  WOO-HOO!  I think I'll call this weekend The Weekend of the Becky(i)s.  I'm planning on having a blast.  Okay - 20 minutes later, I've written one heck of a long blog entry.  Don't look for too many more of these random entries - unless this insomnia continues.

      In looking over the last several blog entries that I have posted, it occurred to me that I never really put any “real” content in my postings.  Generally, I just post links to all of the  urlLink crazy shit  that I find on the internet.  My hope is that sometimes the  urlLink two people  that read  urlLink this  at least find the links here interesting and, dare I say, even  urlLink educational .  That being said, I figured you guys are due for an update on what’s going on with me for a change.  Let’s see – where to begin?  Well, since moving to Boston in October of 2000 to start a new life outside of Pennsylvania, I have managed to earn a 33.8% salary increase.  Not too bad, eh?  I started out as a portfolio accountant for a small wealth management firm situated in downtown Boston, and have worked my way into the operations department, where my official title is now Manager of Accounting Systems.  Basically, I’m the office computer geek.  There are only 31 employees in the  entire  company.  Being the youngest - and most computer savvy, when we purchased a new software package, I took over the job of making sure it works properly.  That has since ballooned into this whole other position (I’m pretty much the operations guru here), which I  love .    Maybe I should have been an  urlLink MIS major  in  urlLink college .  Outside of work, I have amassed a group of friends that I hang out with on a pretty regular basis.  On Tuesday nights we go to  urlLink karaoke  at the  urlLink Milky Way  in Jamaica Plain.  Although JP can be scary at times (in fact, one of my friends got assaulted in the parking lot one night – they caught the girl that attacked her, and she’s currently tied up in the Massachusetts court system), we have a blast there.  On the weekends, we usually end up drinking  urlLink cheap beer  until all hours of the night.  When I’m not hanging out with the gang, I’m usually playing handbells, the baritone, or singing in the choir at  urlLink Newton Presbyterian Church .  Its been great getting back into music again!  Although, in keeping with tradition, I never practice my baritone, even though I should.  As far as the boyfriend scene goes, I’m not going there – its so pathetic, its really just sad…  So that, in a nutshell, is what’s been happening with me, my friends!  I skipped a lot of the details, but I’ll fill them in as I go along.  If I start to stray from keeping you up to date on what’s going on, just shoot me an email and let me know.

       urlLink Weird :    Third child born on 3/3/03 at 3:33 p.m.  By Associated Press, 3/6/03   FORT WALTON BEACH, Fla. -- Good things came in threes for a Florida Panhandle mother.  Samantha Noble gave birth to her third child on Monday, March 3 -- that's 3-3-03 -- at exactly 3:33 p.m.  Dean Noble weighed in a 7 pounds, 2 ounces. He was 19 inches long.  "When I had my first ultrasound, I remember thinking, 'This better not be triplets,"' his mother said. "The threes have to stop sometime."  She said her husband, Aaron, joked about having the child at 3:33 p.m. when he brought her to Fort Walton Beach Medical Center.  "I told him, 'No, I don't want to wait that long,"' she said.  Although baby Dean's two siblings, ages 8 and 3, had complications at birth, he appears to be healthy.  "This is the first time I might be able to leave with a perfectly healthy baby," Samantha Noble said. "Three might be lucky after all."

      Ladies and gentlemen, I have met a boy.  Yes, that's right - I actually have met someone who is interested in knowing Junio as more than just a friend.  For those that know me, this is an unusual thing.  All I can say is,   Its about god damned time!    This is a guy from Salem, Mass. who delivers Snapple to satisified customers on a weekly basis....  As details ensue, I will inform you...      Stay tuned for updates.

      Well, its official - I've hit the quarter century mark.  The mystical forces have finally aligned themselves to allow my car insurance rates to drop and allow me the privilege of renting a car hassle-free.  As a good  urlLink Shippensburg University  graduate, I held a  urlLink barbeque  at my house, complete with burgers, dogs and cheap beer.  We had a   great   night!!

      Tribute to Martha:  1)  I have lived with you longer than anyone that I wasn't related to. 2)  You own a Dremel - you're  so cool ! 3)  It doesn't matter what time I come home at night - you'll still get up to talk to me (although Roommate Becki did that, too) 4)  You love to grill. 5)  Even though your parents are pretentious, you are the  complete opposite . 6)  You tolerate my friends. 7)  You like beer.  I could go on and on, Martha.  Next to Roommate Becki, you're the best roommate anyone could ask for.  I especially thank you for spending your last night in our apartment just hanging out next to the garage, drinking beer and talking about nothing in particular.  I'm going to miss you more than you can possibly imagine, and even though you're only moving to Providence, it just won't be the same.  As John (aka Jerome) said,  It's the end of an era.   Even though I'd rather not think of it that way, it is.  You and Franklin (the Wonder Cat) will be sorely missed...

Easy, you take a broom stick and video tape yourself being Darth Maul.  You're also pretty dumb, so what do you forget to do? That's right, you forget to take the video tape out of the camera before returning it.  Other people are fundamentally cruel, so what do they do? That's right, put it on the internet.   Be prepared to laugh your ass off...

        True Friends    Over the past month, it has become apparent who my true friends are.  About a month ago, I found out that my best friend in Boston slept with the guy that I had been dating.  I'll give you a second to let that sink in.  One Saturday night in mid-May Rob walked out on me when we were having a discussion about our relationship.  Since we'd been drinking he decided he'd better not drive all the way back to his house in Salem.  So he drove to Denise's apartment.  No clue why.  He'd only met her a handful of times, and it still baffles me how he even knew how to get to her house (for those of you who have ever tried to give driving directions to anywhere in Boston, you know how confusing things can be).  After Denise hid everything from me for a week, one of Rob's friends ended up telling me what happened.  I was floored.  When Shana first told me, I told her that Rob must have been lying.  Then she started giving me details of when they had met up again after the first time Saturday night.  There's no way he could have known her schedule without talking to her.  Then the shock set in.  I didn't really sleep the night I found out.  It was Memorial Day weekend, and we were having a Memorial Day/Going Away party for Martha (my roommate who just moved out) and Shana (she moved to Arizona) the next day.  Denise, of course, was supposed to be at the party, but after getting the news, I didn't want her anywhere near me.  Wouldn't you know it, she had all of the beer for the party in the trunk of her car.  So I asked her to come over early so we could let the beer chill.  As she was getting ready to leave to change for the party, I confronted her.  I told her that I knew what had happened.  She was pretty surprised, to say the least.  Then I asked her not to come back.  My friends were great about everything.  They were just as shocked as I was to find out what had happened.  None of them really liked Rob to begin with, but they certainly never expected Denise to behave this way.  She really fucked up, though.  When she messed with me, she messed with my entire group of friends.  They've been so amazing - incredibly supportive, and very willing to listen when I needed to vent.  I think they've been taking turns calling to check up on me.  I'm so lucky to have such great friends that I can count on!  I ended up meeting up with Denise about 3 weeks after everything happened.  She said she never expected to hear from me again.  We hashed things out, and after everything was said, I told her that I can't forgive her for what she's done, and that we can no longer be friends.  I also told her that Boston's a relatively small town, and if she continues to see him and I see them together somewhere, I'll slap him if I'm within range.  And a week after I found out about what happened, Martha moved out.  For those of you keeping count, that means that within a matter of one week, I lost 3 people - the jackass I was dating, my best friend in Boston, and my awesome roommate Martha.  So, yeah.  I'm looking forward to  urlLink vacation  next week.

      Someone please help me.  The Penguin is back from vacation.  She's making my life a living hell.  Here, I even found a picture of her:     Ah, well.  At least I won't have to deal with her when I'm on vacation next week.  I'll be heading down to  urlLink Chincoteague Island, VA  to vacation with my family.  It should be a good time - waterskiing, tubing, and lounging around on the beach.  Not to mention fishing trips with coolers full of beer.  I can't wait!!  Look for  urlLink photos  after July 6.  A bunch of us from work are going to  urlLink Fenway Park  tonight for the Red Sox game against the Tigers.  Hopefully tonight's game will be as good as last night's  urlLink blowout  - Red Sox 10, Tigers 1.

        Barbeques    Before and since Martha's moving out, I've been cooking a lot of meals on the grill.  I love the grill.  There's nothing like the taste of a nice juicy burger fresh off the grill.  My dad showed me how to grill up potatoes that last time I was home.  I'm talking about whole potatoes here.  Just get some Crisco,  urlLink a bag of potatoes , and a flame.  Lather up the potato in some  urlLink Crisco , throw it on the flame for 30-50 minutes (depending on the size of the potato), and you've got yourself a true delicacy.  Now the secret to a good burger is to get some  urlLink ground beef  that's approximately 75% lean/25% fat.  You're not going to get a nice juicy burger with much less fat than that.  And be sure to get ground beef - not the pre-made burgers.  Its much more fun to pack them yourself.  The next ingredient to a successful night of grilling: vegetables.  My personal favorite is  urlLink grilled red peppers .  Marinate them in a little bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar, topped off with a dash or two of oregano and basil.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  D-licious!  Of course, the last ingredient to a successful barbeque is  urlLink beer .  But then again, I didn't need to tell you that, did I?  It seems as though my house is going to be BBQ central this summer.  Look for  urlLink pictures  later this summer.

      I have developed an especially nasty cold over the weekend.  One guy in the brass group I perform with said it could be SARS.  I could've killed him.  So I did a Google search on SARS symptoms.  That took me to the  urlLink WHO website .   Here's what I found:   As more information has become available, WHO-recommended SARS case definitions have been revised as follows:   Suspect Case    A person presenting after 1 February 2003 with history of :  high fever (>38oC)   AND  one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing  close contact* with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS  recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS    Probable Case    A suspect case with chest x-ray findings of pneumonia or Respiratory Distress Syndrome  OR  A person with an  unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death   (!) , with an autopsy examination demonstrating the pathology of Respiratory Distress Syndrome without an identifiable cause.   Comments    In addition to fever and respiratory symptoms, SARS may be associated with other symptoms including: headache, muscular stiffness, loss of appetite, malaise, confusion, rash, and diarrhea.   That little bit about the unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death doesn't make me feel too good.  Although, the article that I pulled this data from is nearly 3 months old.  In any event, I have a stuffy head and a sore back from coughing so much.  On top of that, my right ear hurts.  I'm prone to infections in my right ear...  Looks like I'll be making a trip to the doctor tomorrow in lieu of going to work.  At this point, I'd much rather have to go to work than have to go to the doctor.

      My two youngest brothers came up to visit this past weekend.  We had a pretty good time!  Took them to see  The Matrix: Reloaded  in IMAX at the New England Aquarium.  It was awesome, of course.  Saturday, we went up to New Hampshire to visit our Aunt Cathy and hiked around Lake Masabesic.  Saturday night, Ryan and Sunil came over, and the boys were boys - they played Nintendo all night long.  I crashed around 1:00 or so, and they guys were up until at least 2:30.  Its good to know that my brothers approve of my friends...  This coming weekend I'll be heading back down to PA for some horseshoe pitching and shotgun shooting.  There'll be some pancaking cooking in there, too.  I should be able to get some good pictures posted here early next week.

      On my way to  urlLink karaoke  tonight, I could've sworn I saw  urlLink Mars !  I was driving down Washington St., and as I crossed Beacon St. in Brookline, I happened to look up and saw a big red object in the sky.  Having read a good bit about Mars and its rather close proximity to Earth right now, I couldn't help but get excited at how cool it was that I was looking at Mars!!    While I was at work today, I was reading some articles online about how it's so close right now that you can actually make out the ice cap and some rough terrain with the aid of a simple telescope.  And sure enough, I could see the white ice cap blaring against the redness of the Red Planet.  I could hardly wait to get to the bar and tell my friends to come out and look at this thing!  We were going to be witnessing history.  Mars hasn't been this close to Earth since, well, a hell of a long time ago!  But then I was thinking - I know Mars is close right now, but this thing looks like its even closer than the Moon!!  The object was sort of half-moon shaped, and I thought,  Wow - Earth must be between Mars and the Sun right now!  This is so  cool !   And then I got closer.  And closer.  I kept looking up at the sky, and as I was approaching Huntington Ave., it became clear to me.  It was a blimp.  A red fucking blimp.  A red SATURN blimp.  As in the car.  Definitely  not  Mars.  And the ice cap I could've sworn I saw?  The big while lettering spelling out Saturn.  I was humiliated.  Thank goodness no one else was in the car with me.  Isn't it ironic, though?  I thought I was looking at Mars and it was a  Saturn  blimp.    That settles it - I'm a geek.

      Here's a theory for you to ponder:   The cleanliness of my room is directly related to my ability to get out of bed and get to work on time.   I've been having extreme problems getting to work on time for the past, well, several months.  And its been about that long since I actually cleaned my room.  So - I cleaned my room last night.  And wouldn't you know it, I was able to get out of bed at a reasonable hour and get to work  on time !  Day One of the test period has been a success.  Let's hope I can pull it off again tomorrow.

      I have become an  urlLink Alias  junkie.    Courtesy of  urlLink Netflix , I have been watching the complete first season on DVD.  Now when I say I've been watching, we're talking marathon sessions here.  I watched the first  seven  hours of the first season last Monday night.  I popped in the first DVD when I got home from work, and the only time I stopped was in between episodes when I needed to change the laundry from the washer to the dryer and start a new load in the washer.    We're talking addiction here.  I think part of the reason I'm so addicted is because I'm going to become Sydney Bristow someday.  Someday soon.  I can feel it.  International spies everywhere will fear me.  Some dashing young CIA agent is going to fall in love with me and we will live life happily ever after.  At least until everyone thinks I'm dead for 2 years.  Okay, so maybe I don't want to be a secret double agent.  But something around here definitely needs to change.  I'm getting bored.

      Hiya, kids!!  I'm writing from New York City, where I'm attending the  urlLink Advent Users Conference .  Advent is a software firm that specializes in client reporting, among other things.  I just spent a night out with Advent Users Group members, and a myriad of Advent employees.  As always, it was a good time.  I'm very much looking forward to a wedding this weekend in Manhattan.  It just happened to work out that I was in NYC this week for the conference, and a very dear friend of mine from home is getting married here this very weekend.  There's nothing like traveling to NYC on the company's dollar and enjoying some personal time on the side.

      Any requests for topics to post about on this site?  Its great fun to post on a daily basis, but I often struggle with things to write about.  In general, though, I avoid politics and religion like the plague - I've witnessed way too many family arguments to go down that road...  Any and all comments welcome!

      What exactly is the point of reporting on a  urlLink top secret rocket ?  On a different note, there was some domestic excitement at my house last night.  There's been a rather vile stench emanating from the refrigerator for the last several days.  I'd removed all of the potentially spoiled food/condiments/etc. from the fridge late last week to no avail.  So last night I pumped the cleaning music (read the hardcore stuff), rolled up my sleeves and dug in.  After removing the entire remaining contents of the refrigerator, cleaning the door, and both racks inside, I moved down to the storage drawers in the bottom.  After I removed the first one, I knew I was in trouble.  There was a puddle of murky looking water festering under the drawer.  After I removed the second drawer, the vile stench intensified.  I had found the source of the stench.  The murky pool of festering water was stinking up the entire kitchen.  I cleaned it up, then called the landlord who promptly said,  I'll have a new one over there tomorrow.   He wasn't kidding.  He showed up at my door at 8:15 this morning with a brand spanking new refrigerator.  We plan to have a memorial service for the 42 year-old refrigerator that's been serving our needs for the last 3 years.  This past weekend a gang of us  urlLink took on Mt. Monadnock .  The trip was not uneventful.  Snyder got locked out of his apartment by his idiot roommate, which started a chain reaction of events.  We ended up leaving about an hour later than we anticipated.  In northern Mass, we witnessed a car accident right in front of us (some dude in his mid-life crisis convertible cut off the lady in front of me (who'd cut me off about 15 minutes before) - we barely missed rear-ending her in the process).  Jesse called 911, and we hightailed it out of there so we wouldn't be detained any further.  After we got done with our jaunt up the mountain, we headed towards TGIFriday's in Nashua only to discover that it wasn't there anymore.  We then decided on Ruby Tuesday's, but no one could figure out how to get into the parking lot.  After three attempts, we finally made it.  We got back to Boston around 10, and Snyder's dumb roommate's car was in the driveway, but not at home.  He finally got ahold of the dolt and got into his apartment around 11:45....  All in all it was a great weekend!

      I had a   GREAT   Labor Day weekend at home.  The good times with friends and family (and some family who also happen to be friends) included:  *Going hiking *Hanging out with some friends from high school *Shooting some guns *Square dancing *A little night swimming *Cooking  MANY  pancakes *Throwing some horseshoes *Eating  LOTS  of good food *A little acting *Drinking too much beer around the campfire *Falling in the lake after forgetting the laws of physics  All in all, it was a fabulous weekend.  And I have the  urlLink pictures  to prove it!

      I'm making my first attempt at selling something on  urlLink Craig's List .  Since Christin and I are moving, I'm making a concerted effort to thin out my assets.  Living in the same place for 3 years, I know I've accumulated a lot of junk that I just don't need anymore.  The printer listed on Craig's List probably won't get me $75, but I'm hopeful I'll get a little moolah for it.

      Ahhh....  A moment's peace.  I went home over Columbus Day weekend and got to meet the newest member of my extended family.  My cousin Becky and her husband came home from Indianapolis with their 5-month old son.  He's such a good baby!!      I then got to spend the weekend in my hometown of Chambersburg.  What a small town.  The first place I visited Friday morning was the florist.  I saw one of the minister's from my church in there, and we chit-chatted a bit.  Next stop, Rite Aid.  I needed a toothbrush (I'd forgotten mine) and some batteries for my digital camera.  In there I ran into one of my cousins and her sick daughter - they were picking up a prescription.  Next stop, Grandma and Pap-pap's.  As I was getting out of the car at their house, the minister I had seen at the florist's was waiting at the stoplight by Grandma's house.  She beeped and asked that I say, "Hi" to my grandmother for her (Grandma broke her ankle about 2 months ago).  Talk about a small town.  The weekend was a blast, though.  My brother Jason was up for homecoming king last weekend.  He got first runner-up.  The kid that won king was part of a legacy, though.  His father was homecoming king in 1970 at his high school, and his older brother was king 4 years ago.  I think it was rigged.  I spent Saturday morning with my mom and sister.  We made a trip to  urlLink Aldi's .  For those of you not in the know, Aldi's is a grocery store that is more than just a grocery store.  My mother and I purchased very comfortable slippers there this weekend.  This was the first time I ever had the pleasure of shopping  urlLink there , and I was rather surprised at the ingenuity of this:     Not only does it make carts available at all times and keeps the parking lot shopping-cart-free, but they don't have to employ anyone to retrieve the carts, thereby saving money!!  I got an action shot of my sister getting her quarter back after returning the cart:     We actually pissed off some locals in getting this picture.  A woman and her husband ran up to us with a quarter in her outstretched hand.  She wanted to trade us a quarter for the cart.  Jessica said, "Sorry.  My sister wants to get a picture of me returning the cart and getting the quarter back."  We got some weird looks for that one.  That afternoon we hung out at my aunt and uncle's new house.  Dad, Jess and I were putting some protective stain on the outside of the house.  Jess got a shot of me hard at work:     Sunday was a gorgeous day, and I valked around in ze voods with Mom and Dad, taking a few pictures along the way.                  While on the Mass Pike on the way back to Boston on Monday, Christin called me and informed me of a very interesting conversation she had just had with our landlord.  It turns out that the guys upstairs are moving out at the end of December (one of them bought a house in Weston and the other one is getting married).  The landlord and his wife have decided they want to convert this house into a one-family house and move their family in here.  The sooner, the better.  So they've offered us a pretty sweet deal, and we found a new place to live about a mile and a half away from here.  We'll be a block from the T, and within walking distance to some of my friends' apartments.  We'll be moving either November 16 or December 1.  And now it's time to watch the Red Sox beat the Yankees for the AL pennant.

      For the record, Jillian's is not a preferred hangout for Red Sox fans in Boston.  While it's a fun place to go (even if it  is  turning into shithole) everyone I've talked to about last night's broadcast is pissed off that they kept showing the idiots at Jillian's.  There are other bars in the Fenway area they could have chosen to give a better idea of the Boston crowd:   urlLink Copperfield's   urlLink Cask 'n' Flagon   urlLink Boston Beer Works   I'll be at  urlLink Copperfield's  tomorrow night - hopefully the Fox camera crew will be, too.

      Boston is such a cool city to live in.  The  urlLink Red Sox  have just defeated the Oakland A's in a five-game division series, advancing them to the championship series against their rivals, the New York Yankees (heretofore referred to as the Stankees).  As I'm writing this entry, cars are driving through my neighborhood beeping horns as loyal Red Sox fans are stumbling home from the bars hooting and hollering in celebration of tonight's victory.  I can't even begin to imagine what the celebrations will be like when the Sox beat the Stankees.  But you can believe that I'll be in a  urlLink bar  near  urlLink Fenway  when it happens.  Hopefully I'll be sober enough to catch some cool pictures of the celebrations.

      One of my best friends from home has been married for about three and a half years now.  When they got married, she decided not to take his name, as she and her sister are the only children in her father's side of the family.  Thus, the family name dies out.  I didn't realize that situations like this are occuring all over the place.  An  urlLink interesting article  on FoxNews.com points out various ways to share names with your spouse.  In my friend's case, she kept her last name, while he assumed her last name as a second middle name.  An interesting approach - I remember her saying that he was going to drop it again because it was too confusing to explain to people.  As for me, who knows if I'll assume Mr. Right's last name?  My first goal is to find Mr. Right - the rest is just details...

        urlLink The Thorn Birds   has been on   urlLink WE   over the past several days.  Richard Chamberlain stars as a priest in love with a woman 20 or so years his junior.    I had a sort of obsession with this mini-series when I was in high school.  I can't quite understand it - it's really a tragic story.  Not too much has been going on here, really, as you can tell from the absence of postings to this site.  Right now I'm procrastinating the packing that I'm inevitably going to have to do.  Ugh.  Three years worth of accumulation.  I'm dreading this, can you tell?

      Here's a shout out to Jen Lucas, a fellow  urlLink Chambersburg Area Senior High School  (class of 1995) graduate, as well as a fellow  urlLink Shippensburg University  (class of 1999) graduate!!  Strangely enough, Jen remembers Chad from our Shippensburg days.  I must say, it was quite strange discovering that someone I've known since (at least) junior high knows someone that I've been friends with since college.  Especially considering I can count on one hand the number of times I saw Jen at Ship.  Although, given the size of both schools, I suppose I shouldn't be all that surprised.

Yesterday's basket of goodies came from the management company that runs our building, and included these dark-chocolate-covered-pretzel-cluster-thingies.    Mmmmmmmm....  Today's basket came from some brokerage firm and has all kinds of chocolates, cheeses, and even *ick* caviar.  Forget the cheeses - just give me the chocolates!

      From the  urlLink Weather Channel :     A break for the Northeast tomorrow  Sun., Dec. 7, 2003 2:11 P.M. Buzz Bernard, Sr. Meteorologist, The Weather Channel   Northeast  Most of New England this afternoon looks something akin to what you'd see on Donner Summit or Snoqualmie Pass after a big snow in the Sierras or Cascades. (Where are the rotary plows when you need them?) The good news for tomorrow is that this historic December siege will be over and recovery can forge ahead. Winds will abate over New England, and throughout the region temperatures will rally after a very cold morning. Highs are expected to range from the 20s over northern New England and eastern New York to the 40s south of Baltimore. Best to take advantage of the relatively benign conditions Monday to clean off roofs, gutters and drains, for heavy rain--yes, rain--looms for Wednesday night and Thursday. The rain, in turn, will be followed by another shot of frigid air, and the landscape will morph to a polar ice cap. Ah, the joys of a Northeastern winter.    I heard on the news today that this was the second largest December snow storm in Boston history.

Took  urlLink some more this morning , too.  Thankfully, we're a lot closer to the T here, so I'm not too concerned about shoveling out my car right now.  Nevertheless, Michi and I took an interesting trip to the hardware store this afternoon to pick up some shovels.  Apparently the rest of Brighton had the same idea.  We had to go to two different stores before we found any - they were all sold out in the first store.  Out of all the shots I got from this storm, here's my favorite (taken at the corner of Comm Ave. and Colborne Rd.):

      The long arm of Old Man Winter touched down on the greater Boston area this morning.  I awoke to a light dusting of snow outside my window, which was a pleasant surprise.  At least it was pleasant for me - I don't have to drive to work, or even worry too much about traffic anymore, since my move.  I just take the T into town (even though it's the dreaded B line, at least I know that it's going to take me 50 minutes to get into work everyday, rather than the unpredictability of the Mass Pike).  Areas north and west of the city had traffic backed up for  miles .  One of my co-workers lives 17 miles northwest of Boston.  It took him two and a half hours to drive in this morning.  Another gentleman who works here rolled in about 5 minutes ago - he lives 21 miles north of the city.  Even pedestrians are feeling it - I watched some poor guy lose it just outside the Park Street T station this morning.  His feet went right out from under him and he landed on his back on a nice patch of black ice.  He sort of laid there with his arms outstretched and offered some advice for the rest of us:   Watch the ice there.  It's a bit slippery.   Enjoy your day, folks.

      This week's (and my first)  urlLink Friday Five :    You have just won one million dollars:     1.  Who do you call first?   My mom - I always call her first   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?   Lunch - at the Ritz Carlton - followed quickly by the purchase of a new car   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?   A new car for my sister and my two youngest brothers (one for each) and a new car for Dad, too   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?    urlLink Pi Nu ,  urlLink Shippensburg University , and probably the  urlLink American Diabetes Association    5. Do you invest any? If so, how?   Given I work in the industry, I'd probably get fired if I  didn't  invest.  That being said, I'd probably have my advisor invest 60% in aggresive growth securities, 35% in a mix of large cap equities and fixed income securities, and the remaining 5% in goverment bonds.  Okay, okay - so most of those answers are pretty boring.  Here's hoping for some fun questions next week!

      We hosted 40s night at our house this weekend.  More people showed up than expected, which is always a good thing.  And when many people get together, lots of alcohol is usually consumed - at least that's the case with me and my friends.  Let's just say that 40s night quickly turned into 80s night.  And when 80s night turned into shots of  insert your liquor of choice , things got a little crazy.  One of my friends (who shall remain anonymous) passed out in my bed.  When you pass out in my bed, you're fair game:      Note that I  did  get permission from the subject before posting this picture - I didn't want him to get mad.

      Doing dishes is good for your complexion.  Doesn't that sound like something your mother would say?

This has inspired me to come up with a  Top 5 List of Reasons to Do the Dishes :   It's good for your complexion.

      Well, well, well.  Looks like my comment host went under...  Thankfully, my account was picked up by  urlLink another host .  So comment away, dear readers.  Wait - maybe I should post some stuff worth commenting on.  I'll get back to you on that.

      It seems like all anyone is talking about around here is the weather, myself included.  That's because weather readings look like this when we get up in the morning:     Note the current temp, wind chill factor, and today's high and low temperatures.  More later - I have to get to work.  If I don't freeze along the way.

      The weather over the past 5 days has been more than frigid.  The low on Friday night was -3 degrees.  That's in Fahrenheit, not Celsius.    The  urlLink forecast  for this coming week:    The coldest air in nearly two decades is likely to affect Southern New England Wednesday into early Friday then May release rapidly over the weekend    This past Friday and Saturdays weather May have been just a taste of what is likely to be a more severe onslaught of frigid record cold.   Snow early tomorrow will probably interfere with the morning commute.   Then an arctic cold front will drill scattered snow showers and flurries through Southern New England late Tuesday or Tuesday evening on gale force wind gusts.   Wednesday Will find temperatures hovering near zero with chill similar to that of this past Friday and Saturday.   Conditions are likely to worsen late Thursday with numbing cold  wind chills of 25 to 30 below zero and record cold temperatures of 5 to 15 below  for much of the area. Even the Cape and Nantucket should see temperatures drop to near zero or even just a bit below.   Snow occurring tonight and then possibly again Thursday will make it easier for the cold to penetrate to the south coast, but even if a coastal storm were to miss to the south, this weather pattern will deliver a harsh reminder of what its like to live in the more northerly latitudes.   This coastal development Thursday May add to the winter rigors, especially along the south coast, where several hours of significant accumulations are possible. The track of this storm is much less certain than the shot of oncoming cold. As that intensifying storm passes to our east, we will feel its blustery effects Thursday night into Friday.   Temperatures will recover this weekend as the core of this frigid airmass shifts east of New England.   Heating system and car batteries as well as plumbing systems that are not in good working order and not properly insulated from the Cold May be victim of this 3 day period of excessive cold.   Please stay tuned for updated statements on the upcoming cold, strong wind and possible snows.     If you haven't already broken out the longjohns, you might want to.

      After stressing about it for a week (and staring at a steadily growing pile of laundry), Christin and I went down to the basement this morning in an attempt to fix the washing machine.  Mission accomplished!  Whatever it was that we did, the agitator is once again functioning.  And a good thing it is, too.  I was about to dig into the pile to start recycling some dirty clothes...

      New Year's Eve was interesting, as always.  This is the first year since I moved up here that I didn't have anyone visiting to ring in the new year.  It's a good thing, too.  Usually, much alcohol is imbibed immediately upon my return home from work.  Then I generally stumble to a party where I make an ass of myself, and leave just in time to make it to Boston Harbor for the fireworks.   urlLink Last year , on the way home from the harbor, I struck up a conversation with an Israeli man on the bus - about nuclear armament in North Korea.  This year, however, I came home from work and took a nap.  Around 8:30, Christin and I headed out to the two parties where we planned to make an appearance.    As an aside here, can I just tell you how nice it is to live within walking distance of my friends?  Back to the story.  The first party was at my friend's boyfriend's apartment.  As we were the first people there, it was a little awkward at first, but  urlLink Rolling Rock  always helps out in those situations.  After some pleasant conversation, we decided to head up the street to Michi's house before we got too intoxicated (with our empty stomachs, and all - in hindsight, we probably should have eaten dinner).  We arove at Michi's around 10:15, and I finished the 6-pack of  urlLink Bud Light  that I brought before midnight.  With no one to kiss at midnight, I decided to guzzle on a glass of  urlLink Old New England Egg Nog .  The details are a bit hazy after the egg nog started flowing.    I remember talking to a guy whose last name was Weed.  And his birthday is April 20.    I shit you not.  I actually looked at his driver's license to confirm.  At least I think I did.

      A trip to the veterinarian this evening revealed  urlLink feline ear mites  in my household.  As Baxter never had this problem until I got Lulu, I think it's safe to assume that she brought them with her from the shelter.  He's been miserable for a while now, constantly shaking his head and scratching his ears.  Poor guy.  I'm a bad cat owner.   He must not be too mad at me for taking him to the vet tonight (despite the incessant howling) - he's curled up in a ball next to me right now, asleep as usual.

      From  urlLink FoxNews.com :    Barbie and Ken: It's Over   Thursday, February 12, 2004  By Catherine Donaldson-Evans   NEW YORK — One of America's most famous couples is calling it quits. Are you sitting down?  After 43 years together, Barbie and Ken — as in the dolls — have decided that breaking up is hard to do, but do it they must.  Since they're dolls — and famous — Barbie and Ken had no direct comment about their split at the International Toy Fair, where the bombshell was dropped. The news predictably came from their spokespeople during a press conference Thursday.  "This is an announcement we thought we’d never make," said Barbie’s publicist, Ken Sunshine. "I will confirm that Ken and Barbie are going to go their separate ways."  The circumstances surrounding the famous couple's break were hazy, though their spokespeople assured the press they split up on good terms.  "The flame of love has gone out," said Ken's publicist, A. Russell Arons — who doubles as Mattel Inc.'s vice president of marketing for Barbie. "The tolls of Hollywood romance are well known."  Arons and Sunshine described it as a "sad" and "reflective" day.  Devastated Barbie-and-Ken-friendly homes across the country were suddenly faced with the task of explaining the breakup to their children — and finding separate toy boxes for the pair. Sunshine said he'd been barraged with e-mails from fans.  Arons suggested moms and dads handle it "much like a parent may someday have to explain a divorce" and assure their little girls that Barbie and Ken would always care for each other and be friends.  Cynics called the split a desperate publicity stunt by the couple's company, Mattel Inc., which has seen Barbie's popularity and revenues in the U.S. drop recently despite her numerous image makeovers and new products.  But Arons brushed aside the implication that Mattel might toss Barbie out on her ear.  "Mattel would never dump Barbie," she said.  Barbie was holed up in her Dream House with friends and family, according to Sunshine, who also represents human Hollywood stars Ben Affleck, Justin Timberlake and Leonardo DiCaprio. It wasn't clear where Ken was staying.  A statement the handsome man-doll had prepared was read at the press conference.  "Barbie and I decided to spend some time apart," the statement read. "She's got a new look ... I'm confident we will always stay friends."  When asked about the catalyst for the split, Arons simply said it was the "toll of the fourth movie" they starred in together — a musical due out in the fall called "Barbie as The Prince and the Pauper" — and the pressure of being in the limelight.  Sunshine declined to offer specifics on the relationship's demise, and asked the press to "please, please respect their privacy."  Sunshine and Arons had no comment as to whether there was another "Ken" in Barbie's life.  "Barbie is actually going through something difficult," Arons said, adding that Barbie was just "a woman exercising options."  But after the news conference, Mattel Girls Division Vice President Julia Jensen dished that in the upcoming months "there may be a new blush in Barbie's life."  Longtime rumors surrounding Ken's androgyny and sexual orientation were quickly dismissed Thursday. Arons said the split had nothing to do with Ken's sexuality and that the couple loved each other.  "He is not of mixed gender," she said.  And other whisperings that Barbie and Ken are secretly sister and brother weren't even touched on.  The couple — whose romance seemed so picture-perfect that other successful pairings in and out of Hollywood were frequently dubbed "Barbie and Ken" — met on the set of their first television commercial in 1961.  Their relationship unfolded much like any other Hollywood romance, though it lasted quite a bit longer. They fell madly in love and quickly became joined at the hip, as the saying goes. They even worked together on several projects. It was a fairytale, really. That is, until the unhappy ending.  Some said the relationship dissolved because the pressure of being in the public eye became too great — even after 43 years. Others gossiped that Ken's ambiguous sexuality and Barbie's disproportionate figure finally took their toll.  Still others blamed the break on the fact that Barbie's career and popularity continued to overshadow Ken's. Then there were those who maintained that they were just a plastic couple from the beginning.  Ken's publicist denied that the all-American doll guy felt overshadowed by his gorgeous doll gal.  "For four decades Ken has been a real supporter of Barbie. We've all joked about it, but he really enjoyed being Mr. Barbie," Arons said.  Still, the question remains whether or not Barbie's fame finally did come between the pair.  "Ken played a role in every movie, but Barbie certainly was the star," Jensen added later. "But he's got strong shoulders. I wouldn't want to put words in his mouth. His official statements is that he's obviously thrilled with her success."  The twosome's relationship might be over, but their troubles aren't, especially when it comes to the settlement.  They'll be faced with the task of divvying up the hundreds of possessions they've amassed over the years, such as the Barbie Bubble Bath, camper, townhouse and several vehicles.  As for the mansion in Malibu?  "The Dream House has always been Barbie's," Arons said.

      I love getting new clothes.  It's so much fun to go to work (or anywhere, for that matter) in a new outfit.  There's just something about the way new clothes smell and feel the first time you wear them.  However, there are sometimes slight differences between the old clothes and the new clothes that can take some time to get used to.  Zipper placement is a perfect example.  You know how on men's shirts, the buttons close from the left and women's close from the right?  Well, I would imagine the same concept would apply to zipper placement on pants.  Apparently I was wrong.  Most of my slacks that I wear to work have the zipper on the right, meaning the little flap that covers the zipper folds over from the left.  These great new pants that I got at  urlLink Filene's Basement  last week are awesome - they fit well, and are incredibly comfortable (although the fitting room in the Basement is not quite what I expected - let's just say that there aren't any stalls; it's more of a communal setting).  But the zipper on these oh-so-wonderful pants is located on the opposite side from where I am used to zippering.    For most people, this would not be a big issue.  I, however, am not most people.  I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten to zip up my pants after having done my business in the stall at work.  Let's say I average about 6 trips to the bathroom in a day (yes, I drink a LOT of water).  And of those 6 trips yesterday, I'd say I forgot to zip up my trousers approximately 4 times.    That's a 66% failure rate on remembering to zip up my pants.  And you'd think that since I'm left-handed, I'd have a better time of zipping them up with the zipper on the left side.  Not so, my friends.  Quite a dilemma.

      I know, I know - lately most of my postings have been pretty half-assed.  In my own defense, I didn't really have a lot to say, though.  I managed to get myself into some kind of funk, I suppose.  Life was pretty boring there for a while - I'd get home from work and just veg out in front of the TV.  On the weekends, I was partying hardy, only to need a full week to recover so I could go out and do it again.  And then I met someone. Someone really great. Someone who makes me feel great about myself. Someone who likes me just for being me.  Ah - he's just great...  And I am happy again!  In fact, my roommate has told me I need to wipe the permanent smile off my face.  I'm just so giddy all the time!  So look for more postings in the near future - hopefully they'll be humorous.  I have a great story about a stolen license plate and a lost cell phone I'll have to share with you sometime.  Until then, here's today's  urlLink Friday Five :   What was...    1. ...your first grade teacher's name?    Well, I only really attended the first grade for a month, then Mrs. Ritchie booted me out.    2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon?    Garfield & Friends    3. ...the name of your very first best friend?    Becky Fritz    4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal?    I know this is sad, but I'm gonna have to say Cheerios - my mom wouldn't let us have all the sugary stuff.  To this day, I still LOVE Cheerios!    5. ...your favorite thing to do after school?    I seem to remember watching lots of after-school specials...

      For those of you not in the know, a large portion of the United States is currently being overtaken by the Brood X cicada clan.        Brood X, otherwise known as the 17-year clan (or, as my grandfather likes to call them, those rat-bastard-sons-of-bitches), gestates underground for 17 years, feeding on sap and tree roots.  After 17 years, these suckers bore their way to the surface, leaving nice little holes in your lawn - sort of a natural aerator.  After getting to the surface, they climb the nearest tree or plant, do a little molting, then do the nasty, lay some eggs and die.  It's quite amazing to me how much  urlLink internet media attention  this phenomenon has received.  I don't remember hearing this much about it last time it happened.  Granted, I was only 9 years old, and the internet hadn't made it to the general public yet.  Still, these suckers are nasty!  Why the fascination?  Maybe it's their beady red eyes.  In any event, I wanted to share with you an amusing site called  urlLink Cicadaville  that my uncle forwarded to other members of the family.  Enjoy!  And keep your children indoors!!

      Hey, you crazy Bloggers.  I completely forgot what I was going to post about this morning, because as I was getting ready to create my post, I was checking out my new  urlLink Blogger  dashboard, and saw an invitation to try out  urlLink Google 's new  urlLink Gmail  service.  When word first broke about Gmail, I was quite apprehensive because of the way they're intending to  urlLink fund the gigabyte of storage .  Anyhow, I can't go into details now - work is calling my name.  Shoot me an email at my regular email address, and I'll send you my new Gmail address.  P.S. I have no clue how to make my email address a hyperlink.  Help?

      It seems nearly everyone in my office has been bitten by the love bug recently.  Within the course of one month (yes, that's right - one month) there have been five weddings.  What is up with that?    FIVE WEDDINGS?!?    The love bug's been avoiding me like the plague lately.  The oh-so-wonderful guy I started dating in February has decided to change his mind again about dating me - he's reverted back to his original decision to not date anyone at all.  Love stinks.

      As you can see, things have changed a bit around here.  After a few hours of tinkering with a new template (and many, many revisions to the existing HTML code), this little blog has a new look.  Unfortunately, I've lost all the comments from the old template, as I've decided to go with Blogger's comment tool.  I've also decided to have titles on all of my posts.  We'll see how long that lasts...  Feel free to pitch in your two cents - I'm open to suggestions for change!

      While visiting home two and a half weeks ago, I made the mistake of walking on a wooden footbridge after it had rained.  My sister was with me, and I should have taken her near spill down the steps of the bridge as a warning.  But no.  I could handle the wet steps.    Or so I thought.  About 3 seconds after Jessica nearly fell, I did what she managed to avoid.    I landed right on my ass.  Now, given my somewhat advanced state of intoxication, I didn't realize the extent of my injuries.  In fact, the next morning, I just assumed the aching was part of the hangover that was definitely due to me.  Even the dull pain that built up over the course of my nine and a half hour drive back to Boston didn't drive home that I might have done some damage to my posterior.  Upon closer inspection, it turns out I had a fist-sized bruise on my right buttcheek that was the color of a dark red wine.  Yummy.  And man did it hurt to sit for long periods of time!!  After two weeks of on-again-off-again pain, I went to the doctor this past Tuesday.  He confirmed my fears - a bruised tailbone.  Apparently if I'd broken it, the pain would've been unbearable.  He put me on some prescription pain killers ( urlLink Ultracet  - check out the website; they have a calming Flash intro that's got music and everything!), and suggested I get an ass donut.  My  urlLink inflatable ass donut  and I are best buds for the next 4-6 weeks.
