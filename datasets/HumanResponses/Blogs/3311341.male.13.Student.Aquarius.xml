       My parents are a bunch of people... Nothing more than that really... They're cranky, and don't do anything unless they get five times of what you get out of it.  I asked if they would take me Circuit city, a while ago... They still haven't. And they said the would take me today, on Monday. So, my "mother" asked if I was expecting them to take me, and I answered her with a "no". She said "Alright."   I then asked her later, and she said "I was basing my decision on whether you had expected me to. So, she gets her way, again. I only have four more years of school(if I drop out, which I need their permission to) so it's a lose-lose situation. *sighs* My dad is slowly progressing on our catacombs... erm, basement. It still looks similar to our septic tank. But, yeah. He's a grouch, and stubborn, and I keep offering to help, and he tells me "Stop picking on my stuff. Go away." He's starting to get annoying. I'm not sure if I would rather be independent, instead of living in this family. It's pretty much the same business.  I'm not sure if I want a portable dvd player, still. I have a ton of money that I could go buy one. BUT, the one I wanted went up by $130. I'm extremely disappointed. So, now I could probably buy a car... Lol. But I'm not old enough to drive it. I don't know anybody anymore. Not even God. I've drifted away from life itself. And I'm pretty much depressed. Neopets has taken a huge chunk of my life away. And I'd rather be engulfed in that, rather then the life of my family. I hate it all.

       Woohoo! Go me. I tried before and had him down to 1500 hp when the browser closed.   My Youth pastor talked about sacrificing greed at youth group tonight. And, I went a little bit crazy.... And I didn't feel that comfortable. But, it was good, because he used my name as an example for taking care of an estate, and since nobody knows who I am, he was like "And it would be kind of hard to handle his grandfather's estate in seventh grade. Sooo, yeah. They were messed up. Heh

      Grr, on Neoquest II, I got beaten by the leximp(my username's fieryone, by the way). Nothing again today.  My little brother asked if a baby would come out wrong if a cousin and a cousin had a baby. Lol. I got new shoes, too. They're black and gray new balance's.    RETURN OF THE KING COMES OUT TOMMORROW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I can't wait. *excitedly fidgets in his chair* YEAAAAHHH. I need it. It's my own. My precciiooouussss... I'm really good at doin' the gollum voice. I've practiced perching and speaking. It's tough, but you get good after practice. *sniff* I'm so excited.

      Today I finished Neoquest II. Muhahaha. The last boss wasn't as hard as people made him sound. I beat him with full health. Pfft. Weaklings... I started Neoquest II on evil. And, I researched the insane difficulty weapons, which is the next difficulty. The prizes run for 4 - 13 million. The staff that you can get with 13 constant icons is about 10 million. The sword, and other stuff is about 4 million. BUT, you can't beat insane if you die. You start over... Sooo, if you lose on the last boss. Yep. But, it's worth it.  I swung on the swing for half an hour straight... Nothing else too much today. Oh yeah. My mom owes me $15, and I'm gonna get another $15 for mowing my grandma's lawn.

       I promise I'll write about an interesting day, sometime. I told you it's gonna be a long way through before, and that most of my life is boring.   I had a detention because I didn't bring my "free reading book" to class, the day before. So, I had to miss one of my "community help clubs". I guess that's what it's called, because we do programming for educational machines. It's fun.  I haven't seen Dom in a while, and she probably has no idea how much she interests me as a friend. She's so nice... If she was reading this she'd be like "Awww, how cute..." Lol.  I've given up on Liv Tyler, because by the time my parents will let me marry, she'll be... Old. Like 45. But she's still hot. I'm now convinced that Alexa Vega is pretty after watching Spy Kids 3-D. She had a music video on the special features, and I didn't like her costume, because even though I'm tempted to look at places I shouldn't, her costume wasn't cool, because... I don't know. It was just ugly. *shrugs*  Creative Writing Club tomorrow. I've only submitted one piece, and I should have handed in atleast ten. I feel bad. I'll write one tomorrow. ;)  Hmmm. I scared a lot of people today by making them think that they were like the person in the Truman show, or the "harvested people" in the Matrix. They gave me funny looks. And I was like "So, you're a machine?"... Their faces remained emotionless.  Nothing to do. It's so boring. But, I found a poem before when I was cleaning my room, and it was really sad, but cool, because it was well written. It had a good story line, also, and I wanted to post it but I couldn't find the book it was in, again.   It was about a boy, who found his cat near a dead baby bunny, and then wandered outside  after his dad. Then he noticed an older rabbit and pointed it to his dad. His dad started crying because he knew that the mother was looking for the baby that his cat had killed. It was sad. Stupid cat. *crys*  I hope that never happens to me. Gotta go to bed. (Almost done with Neoquest II, by the way)

      Another day wasted? I'm not sure. I know how disappointing it is to not read somebody's life for one day, but yeah. I'm sorry. I had a huge math project to do that ended up looking like Barney... I colored it purple and green. I stayed up 'til midnight then woke up to do homework at 5:30, that I had not done in place of the project the night before.  My brother read the journal when I was in bed the other night... He probably still does and is most likely going to read this entry. *waves*   Grr, youth group tonight. It seems like the people there are friendly, just not friendly... As in they're nice in their "cliques" and then aren't exactly nice, or willing, to get friends outside of their groupies...  If I ever told my youth group leader, who knows me, but doesn't really... Well... She doesn't show personal feelings. Only to people that've been around a long time. She's nice though, and I'm thankful to know someone like that.  I've played  urlLink Neoquest II  some more today, and got past that stupid boss. The final boss was easier then him, though. I'm in a new world, and so far it's pretty easy, but it's the last world, and I need to level up 10 levels to get to the max level. It's highly reccomended for the last boss, who is extremely hard. Or atleast that's why people say on the forums... I don't believe it, because they said that the cursed faeries were hard, and they were fairly easy. I beat them at a really low level. I think below forty.  I'm zoning out into that subconcious level that I mentioned in one of the previous journal entries. I feel like I'm high... *sniff. Starts coughing like he's having a hangover* j/k j/k *The genie disappears... for now...*

       I don't post on Sundays, so yeah. My mom doesn't want to let us because she doesn't want me to get... Umm... Dumb? Yeah, I think's that has the... Dern'.  I hope you get bored reading this journal. It's not really written for you, just for self support, kind of... Some machine is reading this and saying "This guy's smoking something." and I say "Stupid machine, must've been that pot this afternoon." Haha, see?  I don't smoke, though. I watched the season finale of 7th heaven, and the only good part was when Matt decided that divorce wasn't a good way, and Kevin fainted because he realized that Lucy didn't WANT to have a baby, but was already pregnant(and he fainted(He's a cop, so it's funny like that))  I've read other people's journals, and they mention stuff about philosophy and classes  and other things that they do. I don't. Like I said before... "Get used to it." It's gonna be a long and boring way through.  I hung out with one of my neighbors today. We set up a theme park kind of ride, that was really fun, on the new swingset that my Dad and I worked on. That was our most recent home improvement project.   People owe me a ton of money for mowing more than an acre BY FREAKING HAND. I did it all with a push mower ( XD )I'm getting impatient, but don't worry.  I won't kill you... Yet.   About that swing formation we set up. It was really fun because we went 200 degrees to about 230 degrees of the rotation(almost all the way around). He eventually fell off, and made a movielike *THUD*. It was really cool. So... I asked him if he wanted to do it again so I can record the effect for one of my movie-like creations.   After we got hurt with a piece of tree, two rings, and a swing, we decided to practice for our upcoming movie production in the summer, when my cousin comes.  He likes to make cool movies with our camera. It's kind of fun, until somebody gets hurt(then it's hilarious   This is probably the longest journal entry I'll ever post... I think. School was incredibly boring today. I got another of my 8 grade exam practice packets finished. I'm thankful that I finally got that done, because I was a little bit behind.  After school, I had jazz band. My director said we sounded pretty good. I'm the only half-decent one in the low brass, because all the other players are trombone 6th graders, and they can't play for crap, not that they would want some... I think.  I played louder than normal trying to conduct them in playing properly.  And now that I've been writing this post for so long, it seems like the words are rearranging themselves into swear words because I'm not really paying attention to what I'm typing. It's a wierd feeling. a;dosfi;aodshifa;oshf. Lol, random outburst *blinks*  Wierd... The casserole my mom made today wasn't bad. I leveled up in Neoquest II, preparing for Hubrid Nox, which I died on... I got him down to half his HP, because he kept healing.   We're swimming in P.E., which I really don't want to call "P.E", because it's tacky. (I'm kind of going backwards) I sat next to a girl named Nicole, who scares me because she has random outbursts of strange experiences she's had. This morning she told me that "When I got home from AppleBee's it looked like my mom's care got a hair cut"... I don't know why she says that stuff. After a long discussion about the origin and planning of the Erie Canal in Social Studies, we said that the construction began in Rome. And she had the brilliant idea, that it was not ROME, NEW YORK, where the Erie Canal is, and everybody thinks that she might believe it's Rome, Italy. But no... She thought it was Rome, Paris. Rofl. Dang, she's funny.  When I woke up this morning I felt strange and unhappily tired, because my brother's alarm clock rang before mine did. It's not fair. I like my stuff to have priority...  I should go soon, because my mom's complaining about my constant AWESOME typing. Not to mention that's so awesome because I'm veru neat and have good error spotting. ;P  *sighs* I don't want to change in a locker room with naked people. It scares me... That's kinda sick, though... Remind me to pack my bathing suit.

      Today I spent a huge amount of time playing Neoquest II. Another ten hours of my life wasted. And at the end I lost to the person I was leveling up for. He didn't seem to hard. I spent a couple of hours in the battle dome, today. I upped my percentage of wins to about 81%. I still need it to be above 90%. I wonder how all the people with the good pets get so good... I guess it takes loads of discipline, which I lack. I'm sad about my life. I'm pretty hopeless for what I have left to do. I get bored with almost everything, and I get mad at people for little problems. I need help   urlLink This  is my brother's journal... He doesn't update his as much I do. But he probably started like this.  Are journals supposed to be depressing? I feel like I'm not writing about anything good. Sorry about that. Email me with your comments, at Gandrolok@hotmail.com(opinions on my journal, only, please)  My brother went to a prom alternative with the youth group. Everybody keeps asking him how it was and stuff but he says "Alright, I guess." He's strange like that.  He babysat us while my mother and two sisters were at their dance recital. I didn't like him as a caretaker. He yelled alot and was extremely careless, and kind of selfish(not to say that he's a bad person, just not patient). Gar, how do people type so fast. I've spent all day editing this post to fit my schedule, and what I've done. And I guess I'm done for now.

        Today there, wasn't really anything interesting(again)... I hissed at someone and scared them. That was kinda funny. They jumped - alot. Dom, I miss you. *sniff* Read my boring journal. I only do this for purposes of my own... Just for self-pity again. So that I can expose some things to take revenge. Yes, I am pitiful. No, I don't really want to hurt people, but yes I have gotten run over by an aircraft carrier which, by the way... It brings the thought to mind that I got those oranges stuck in the vacuum cleaner after it exploded. IT'S NOT MY FAULT, I SWEAR!!!(I wrote sweat the first time before correcting it...)  I'm saving for a portable dvd player. Which I want very badly, after experiencing one on my trip to Washington, DC. The one I want is over $300 and it's reviewed as the "best one out there". I have almost half the money, and despite me beggin my mom for jobs and money, I haven't gotten income in the last week and a half. I want one by the end of May, which is when we might travel to Kentucky.   I'm usually on a chatster server(IRC) and reside in the channel #Middle-Earth most of the time. So if you ever want to experience true boredom, chat with me.              *Personals* 13 year old desperate for something to do         Saving for DVD player         Doesn't want friends         Just money, lol.

        Well, I decided to post my life on a website so that all the stalkers out there  can find me... and kill me. But I don't care. I'm prepared to die. Kind of. Today  wasn't very eventful. The high school music program concert was tonight. I didn't  go because I had a headache that hurt only when I moved.    I don't really like this site as an online journal but I guess I'm thankful for  it anyway. I've been wanting one for a while, now. Anyway, for background(addressed  to stalkers) I'm thirteen right now, and I live in New York. Figure the rest out  from my journal.     Nobody complimented me today, which is strange, because I'm so cool... ;P  Actually, I'm just selfish, but yeah. Today was boring and I just realized how bad  it must be for you to sit and read this... Boring, eh? Yep. Get use to it.

       Darn, I keep missing out on worshipping God. It's hard to step off a cliff and dive into another sea of hope or belief. Every different place I see, people are entirely different in their beliefs, yet share similar personality characteristics.   Once again, it seemed like our Youth Pastor was talking directly to me. Kind of... I know that there's a lot of other people just like me in the youth group, but the message he delivered tonight applied directly to what I've been experiencing.  It was about Sampson, and how he played around sin, just like dancing around a campfire. If you dance too long, then you might get burnt. Which is what I've been doing. I haven't gotten burnt yet, but I'm still arrogant to the paths I'm using. You might say "Well, if you're talking about it now, then how come you say that?". I say it because I get caught up in other things that are unGodly and forget that I've told myself to be a better "christian". I don't think I'm really following through with what it is to be a christian. Right now, I need help. Pray for me, please.   Gar, sometimes I read over my own blog wondering who's it is, and I notice how badly it's written. "mechanical machine"(alliteration-I hate alliterations, it's retarded) "another sea of christians"(that's not what I meant. I meant the concept of belief). I hate this service...

      I hate mowing. Not because we have a huge yard and it takes two hours of continuous effort, BUT because it's a lot of time to do nothing except walk. It doesn't occupy mental thought, and instead physical. Anyway, everytime I walk around for two hours, which usually happens twice a week I think... A lot...  My thoughts trail away to creation of the world, my life - feelings, what other people think of me, and how I generally think. Often I find myself thinking of the meaning of a language, and what people REALLY mean when they say something. Not what they feel like, and how that relates to what a word specifically means, but what sort of communication they're trying to convey to me through the language. Try it sometime. You'll learn to loathe a simple chore.  In other news, Iraq was blown up today. Have a nice day, and sleep tight. You're next.   Things to think about: -If you don't have a reason to be better than someone, then don't critisize that someone.  -I've been "in love" for nearly my whole life, but now that I'm older I'm starting to think. If I believe in God and that he is the Trinity, then does that mean I'm going to heaven? If I believe there is a heaven, does that mean I'm gonna go there after I'm finished? Someone I know said that if you live on an island isolated from christianity, and you believe there is a creator of this, and blah blah blah, then you'll go to heaven, because you have no other way of discovering a God. But, yeah. I doesn't matter.

      The following IS a copyrighted book that I've heard from my youth pastor, however I'm going to take a chance and expain it to you as close as possible. It was written by  urlLink Max Lucado  and Sergio Martinez and is called "You are Still Precious in His Eyes." The basic line of it is as follows:     There once was a little town on a little hill far far away. On the the little hill were little people called wimmicks. The wimmicks would give sticker stars and sticker dots as they cared. They stuck stars on to the wimmicks that they thought were talented or better than others, and dots on the wimmicks that achieved nothing, or did something bad or non-productive.     Anyway, there was one particular wimmick who's name was Punchinello. Punchinello was often raking in grey dots because he could not jump high, or run fast. He did not look good or have any talent. So, all the other wimmicks took their gray dots out of their little storage boxes and gave them to him.     One day, Punchinello found a wimmick that did not have any dots or stars. Some admired that wimmick for not having any dots, so they stuck a star on her. Some did just the opposite.  However, none of the stickers stayed on the wimmick. They just fell off.    Punchinello even went further when he say this wimmick and asked why the stickers fell off. She said "I go to see the woodcarver everyday. I spend time with him, and he teaches me to not care about the stickers." Punchinello soon left and went to see the woodcarver.     The woodcarver was a large, magnificent man. He cared for all the little wimmicks.  (to make a long story short): Puncinello talked to him, and the woodcarver gave Punchinello a pep talk about whatever other people think of him. It doesn't matter. "You are all very special in my eyes." As Punchinello walked out of the woodcarver's shop a sticker fell off.   The End   Think about what it all means. If people are making marks on you, then talk to God.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Often, you've seen people refer to loping from God as "falling away". I feel like I'm in the situation the person means to communicate, but I don't feel like I'm falling down. Sometimes I feel better, and I'm often more entertained constantly with the lacking thoughs such as starvation, pain, and death in other parts of the world. Although, when I attempt to meet with God I feel good, such as you do when you meet with the Holy Spirit. But, later, I feel bad because the objects of the world seem so easy to gain and use, like secular games that promote violence or TV shows that contain immoral ideas and suggestions. Sometimes the entertainment promotes with humor, which is probably the best way to advertise something. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right now, I'm observing South Park, where they impersonate Phil Collins in cartoons and he says "I don't think it's right to laugh at people with disabilities"(with a strained australian accent). Then a man procedes to cross the screen. I don't want to watch it, but it is entertaining. I'd rather be around God, but sometimes it's hard to venture from the distractions of daily activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to the "falling up" thing. I feel like I'm getting better at achieving in life, but I'm decreasing God's importance. I know that I shouldn't be doing this, and I feel guilty because of it, but... It's hard to explain something when you can't even figure it out yourself, ya' know?

      How would you respond if somebody told you that and it was  true ? I'd... I don't know what I'd do. Probably cry or something. Even though everybody grows up to a certain point where they rarely cry, sometimes they still do.    And sometimes I feel like nobody cares about me. Maybe it's because I don't get my way, and the person that became the instant scapegoat said something to upset me. Which is what I feel like when I have to mow. I end up being really mad about it, and(having a big yard) spend two hours cutting the grass and at the same time plotting of how to kill somebody 400 different ways.     *NOTE*  I love the 400 numbers. I  don't know why but if you ask me to tell you something that involves numbers it will most like have the number "4 hundred something"  *END OF NOTE*      Don't mow your lawn if you have a big lawn. End of statement.  ANYWAY, *sighs* I need more people to talk to. To fellowship with and be a part of their lives. I need someone to take up my time, and someone to be a league in my life, and me, to play a part in theirs. Don't bother sympathizing for me, because I don't care. This wasn't written to gain sympathy, it was written to tell you how I feel. Is that not the reason for weblogs? To hide your secret feelings and thoughts?       *NOTE*  Post your ideas about my weblog theorem in the comments section. I'll be glad to see feedback.  *END OF NOTE*    Today I've felt neglected, for reason of my own emotions, mostly. I guess I need to find  God . It seems so hard to try, doesn't it? The world has so many things to offer. And they're much easier to get, then from following  God  I guess trying to be a friend of  Him  is like getting on a train that rarely stops. It's hard to get on because it's moving so fast, but if you try and are persistent, like Wile E. Coyote(Yes, it IS spelled like that) then you'll eventually be heading towards a paradise.       I'm not being very persistant with that, though. Please pray for me.

      Right now I'm not even half way through the day, but I couldn't think of any other title. So, yeah.  We got a new printer YESTERDAY. *drowns in stupidity* It's an Epson CX5400. Don't ask me how I remember that kind of stuff. It's one of the weird things that you learn to do(memorize long series of random numbers). I kinda like it because it's better than our old deskjet c890, and it comes with funky software. It has a scanner unit ontop of it, which is useful. So it works as a scanner, printer, and basically a fax machine. You can copy documents without your computer on. Although, when it DOES scan it automatically changes the picture according to a ratio to fit an 8*11 inch paper, with the set margins. If you've read this far, you're pretty dedicated.  Also, the 3rd age of KoC started yesterday, and thanks to a massive channel on their IRC network(usually give or take about 20 people from the margin of 350 people. That's MASSIVE) It's by FAR the largest channel I've ever seen on IRC. I know have twice as many troops as I had in the first week of the last age.     Reflecting on  urlLink Dom's post , I started reading a great book today called "The Dragon's son" by Margaret Weis. The description's in the book make it the people seem really colorful. It's like a REALLY well done painting, fluid with a theme and very colorful. I'm only around page 75, but her books have caught my attention. Ciao

      The third day of KoC.  Please bookmark      urlLink this link , and go there as often as you can every TWENTY FOUR HOURS  Thank you. It will help me enlarge my army. Follow the instructions. And don't click "JOIN THE WAR!" if you don't wanna play. Just do the number thing. It helps a WHOLE lot. Thanks anyway.

      Anyway, I recently started playing  urlLink Kings of Chaos . It's kind of an addicting game where over time your gold and turns accumulate. You use your turns to attack other players. The more turns you have, the more attacks you can place. Also, there's weapons and defense systems, and also spies who you can send to see other player's attack power, defense power, and gold, in case you wanna beat them and loot their piggy banks. It makes me excited when I leave the computer thinking "After I come back in two seconds I'm gonna be rich. However, when I turn around and sit down after taking two steps away, nothing happens... *cough* Right, so it's annoying having to wait a day for sufficient funds to come through.  I went to a worship team rehearsal for my youth group last night, and it was fun. I sang, and drummed. Afterwards, I asked my brother how I did drumming and he responded with "Oh, you were drumming?" which means that my drumming was very unnoticable from the other drummers there. That's a good thing. It was fun, anyway. Recently,  urlLink Gaia online  an anime roleplaying community, has caught my attention also. Basically it's a HUGE forum community where everything you post and look at gives you gold. You use gold to buy outfits for your avatar, a little charactar that appears on your posts. There's general conversation, technical help and other things of the such, roleplaying forums, and so on. It's pretty fun. Although it takes a lot of posting to get some good clothes... Peace.

         Well, my current time consumer has been Dance Dance Revolution Konamix... On Saturday night we had this instant idea that popped out of nowhere to go buy a pad and DDR. I have no idea how it came up, but all of a sudden we where there playing it. Strange, huh?    I can beat 3-6 feet levels, which is satisfying considering my siblings are doing 1-2 feet levels. My dad, my brother Tap, and I are competing, but Tap is closest in skill to me. I want to get two pads to compete with him. ^_^    I missed Worship rehearsal, again, because Tap had to sound at our other church, so I had no ride. *sigh* It's probably mostly my fault, though.    We went to college orientation on Wednesday and Thursday. I only went on Thursday, but yeah, it was really fun. The people there were nice, but the dorms(Tap isn't staying on campus, anyway) remind me of dimly lit prisons. The walls are dull colored and the lighting is VERY non-existant. Pretty much a cave. The rooms are extremely small, too. I'm not going to that college. Or atleast not staying on campus.    The other activities there sound like fun, frequent sports games, music, other clubs. The staff said there were over 200 clubs there, and if you can't find one you fit into, then you can make your own and the university will give you $250 to fund. You have to find a couple more people within a week or two, to keep it, heh. Hmm, I want to go to the University of Phoenix, Arizona. Or something like that.    You see ads for it, everywhere. VG producing, music, and a bunch of other AWESOME stuff that I want to do. I might be an engineer of some sort, but I really enjoy interacting with musicians and playing music together. It feels good to be able to play a piece together after you've been practicing for months. ^_^ You'd never forget that. It's your own creation to be proud of.    Time to go eat breakfast. It's odd that I usually don't eat breakfast for a couple of hours after I wake up. I should eat first, but usually I head straight to the computer to do my little routine. And I'm probably gonna start doing a couple hours of DDR.   Ciao!
