      Home.  I flew  urlLink Northwest  and we actually made it home on-time.  Of course, the 6:25 a.m. flight isn't exactly backed up behind a lot of other flights.  Sophie's got an  urlLink ear infection .  Joys of toddler-hood.

      In Ft. Lauderdale to see my  southern cohorts  from work.  Warm is an understatement.

Cool stuff.     urlLink Two kids , Madeline and Sophie.  They rule.  So did the Peruvian Air Force pilot get a little sticker for the side of his  urlLink plane ?

      Yikes.  It's been over a week since I've written anything.   urlLink Work  is busy as hell but a blast.     urlLink Sophie  saw her first baseball game on Tuesday when we went down to the new  urlLink Comerica Park  (call it CoPa and I'll beat you) along with some TEKgroupers for a game against the  urlLink Texas Rangers .  The new ballpark is awesome.  As much as I miss the "character" of Tiger Stadium, now that I'm a parent, having a parking lot a foot away from the stadium rocks.  Oh, and the  urlLink Tigers won !  5-4 in the bottom of the ninth.

      I'm not updating as often as I'd like.  I'm almost over it.  Big news from the weekend:   - We get our bedroom back!!!!  We love Sophie to death, but she's now sharing a room with her big sister, Madeline.  Lisa and I are thrilled to be able to wake up without the fear of waking up a sleeping toddler who needs the additional hour or two of sleep.   - Of course, the line from the weekend was overheard on the monitor at 7:15 am on Saturday morning...."Sophie, Sophie, Sophie....the sun is up, it's wake up time!"  Sites: http://www.fuckedcompany.com - Hilarious, possibly insightful, must-read about the crazy business environment that's grown up around/with the web.

      It's Monday, no, it's Tuesday now.    I FINALLY went running this evening.  The shoes that acted as walking shoes for the last 366 days (purchased last year on Father's Day) were used to help propel my sorry behind for a mile this evening.  That may not sound like much, but I haven't run AT ALL in at least three years.  I did manage to run the mile in a bit over eight minutes, so I'm pleased that I managed more than just a brisk walk.  Folks that have heard me talk too much about running can now give me grief if I don't follow through and continue with this.    Back to Father's Day.  Sunday was very nice.  We all managed to sleep in until after 9 in the morning!  Anybody with little kids knows that anything beyond 8 o'clock is simply gift sleep.  Lisa and the girls made me a cool home made card covered with bottle caps and other "stuff."  Madeline helped me make pancakes for breakfast and then she and I hung out in the backyard for awhile.  Sophie and mom slept a lot.  We then went over to Cha Cha Jill's house to grill and have dinner with my father-in-law and his wife.  My father-in-law NEEDS a computer.  To that end, we got him the CD-ROM collection from  urlLink Mad Magazine .  He can't use the software until he buys a computer.  I managed to watch A LOT of auto racing; always a good thing.     I'm tired.  Later.

      Milestones.  - Sophie will no longer be an infant/baby as of tomorrow at daycare...she moves to the young toddler room full-time.  - Lisa finishes a Spring term class at  urlLink Eastern  tomorrow.  One more down.  - Madeline is a smart-ass.  Getting her ready for bed tonight she made a face and said something like "Phewwww!"  Lisa asked her what was smelly and Madeline makes her best smart aleck smile and points to her bottom.  I may have to teach her the rules to safety soon.  - I went to the batting cages with Steve after work today.  I actually made contact with the ball (slow pitch machine, thank you).  I don't believe I've swung a bat, outside of wiffle ball on Wing Ct., in a decade.

      Our almost 3 year old, Sophie, entered the world of "big kids" when she fell down the stairs last night.    If you're not a parent, you won't understand how sickening the sound is of hearing your kid wallop against a wooden stair, to be followed by some mighty loud crying and wailing.    Her limbs were intact and the tears were plenty, with a big colored bump on one side of her noggin, so we opted to be safe and took her into the  urlLink U of M Emergency Room .    "Did she black out?  Any vomiting?"  Nothing funky going on with this tough toddler, so after being checked out by the doc, we headed home back for stories and some healthy "Couple more minutes!" before finally getting her and Madeline to bed.  Sophie, new rules for you when on the stairs:  No more bare socks when on the stairs.  You have slippers...wear 'em.  No more twenty-seven items carried down the stairs from your bedroom...try and find the living room floor and see if there's any room for it all.  You have your sister have now reached kid quota for tumbling on the stairs...next time try a magic carpet ride.  -chris

      Ever pay a bill online?  Your phone bill, maybe a credit card, even your mortgage, can probably be paid online.  I pay many of our bills online, yet today, I hit Comcast's web site, hoping to pay my cable/net access bill, and what do I get?  I am able to find out how much I owe, but then I'm directed to DROP MY PAYMENT OFF at a payment center.    Hello?  This is the company that's been spewing for more than a few years about how the "future is broadband, blah blah blah."  I call 'em up, ask about paying my bill online and I get "You may pay your bill over the phone if you'd like."  That's well and dandy, but I don't want to talk to a human when I pay my cable bill.  I want to fire up a web browser, hit the payment site, enter some numbers, and, like magic, pay for another month of ToonDisney, Noggin and the like.  -chris

      I took the girls to a  urlLink University of Michigan Womens Gymnastics  meet last night.  The place was almost full...pretty damn cool to see that sort of crowd out for the meet.    Now about those cowbells that show up, until now, for me anyway, at basketball or hockey games...just where the hell do these people come from who have these cowbells?    We're enjoying the meet, cheering on our Wolverines, when suddenly I hear the familiar-sounding..."tap tap tap......Go Blue!"  I look to my right, and sure enough, there's a guy in a Michigan sweatshirt, leading a cheer for our Maize and Blue, with his cowbell.    Is there some secret cowbell society I'm not aware of?  I figure there must be some group that organizes the cowbells...there's NEVER more than one at a game, yet there is always one at a game.    Can somebody  urlLink clue me in  to this seemingly secret thing?  -chris

      So, there's a war going on.   As with other "hot items" covered by the news media, as time goes on, the war in Iraq has become another "thing" covered every fifteen minutes with a "news brief."  The evening news coverage provided by the cable news networks has become nothing more than similar versions of "Hey, check out my new videophone" and "Let's pretend we know how to fight a war" with "analysts" and other "experts" providing the "answers" to those "questions" we didn't know neededed answering, like "Where is Saddam?", "How come we haven't won yet?" or, even better, "Hey Peter, how are things in Baghdad?" Wait, never mind on that last one...but you can catch Peter on a Taiwanese TV network now....I wonder how "I was a puppet" translates.

Are they having problems in some of their schools that are prompting parents to ask for the banning of scarves, so students can focus on learning and not have to worry about getting beat up because of an item of clothing?    No.      The French National Assembly has approved a ban on "conspicuous" religious symbols in French schools, with the focus of the attention on banning Muslim headscarves in school.      France, paraniod?      Imagine if the United States Congress passed a similar ban; no head scarves, no yamakas, etc.  Speeches from across the world would condemn the US as being a bastion of hate and fear mongering, of forcing children and their families to compromise their religious values.

      So what happens when mom's sick and goes to bed, leaving dad to handle evening entertainment with the daughters?    Duh.    Time to teach them the proper meaning of green, yellow and red flags; in other words, see if they'll stomach some racing.    The 2004 NASCAR season got underway on Saturday night with the Budweiser Shootout, an all-star event made up of last year's pole winners and past series champions.  Did the divas manage to tolerate it?    "Dad, it's the Home Depot car!" Madeline proudly shouted; a victim of American marketing and too many trips to the store for Projects that Dad Will Never Finish.    "Sophie, why is he wearing a fire suit?"      "He might get fire." (she's 3 years old)    While they didn't care that Dale Jarrett's win helps resurrect a team that's been on the wane the previous two seasons, it was fun watching and listening to them describe what they saw.    Madeline's impression of Jeremy Mayfield's wreck was spot-on, including the veer into the wall the car made after losing it's right-front tire.  I knew those ballet lessons would pay off.    I wonder how they'll tolerate Figure 8 racing at Flat Rock this summer...

      Last night the Potsie family FINALLY made it out sledding.  The location was the hill behind  urlLink Pattengill Elementary School .  Close to home and basically a hill of ice.    I did have visions of Madeline and Sophie tumbling down the hill (me, uptight?), but all was well.    Madeline's been sledding all winter at school and had zero issues with spinning around like a top in her saucer sled as she zoomed down the hill.  Sophie took a couple of trips down with Lisa, but I think playing on the climber and using the slide in freezing weather was more her speed.    I can't describe how much fun it was to finally have the kids out sledding.  Talk about a rush of childhood memories.  I remember spending what seemed like hours and hours outside with Bobby Browne, building forts, throwing snow balls, and basically turning into frozen little kids.    Ra!

      It's nice to see that NASCAR takes its image and growing popularity seriously, especially when it comes to shaking that southern, good ole boy image that so many people choose to apply to stock car racing.    Case in point:    One Jimmy Spencer, a veteran of the Nextel Cup and ambassador of the sport, chose to welcome Toyota's entry in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck series for 2004 by uttering the neighborly words "They bombed Pearl Harbor, don't forget."    NASCAR's response?    "That's Jimmy Spencer."    This is the same sanctioning body that chose to deal with Tony Stewart's tirades by having him attend anger management classes.    For Toyota's sake, I hope their teams and drivers pound the snot out of the competition in the Craftsman Truck series, in the same way they've pounded the competition in the dealer showrooms.

      The temperature rocketed up to 33 F today!  Whoo hoo!  Snow actually melted.  Spring is a scant six+ weeks away.    Today starts full-time everything for everybody...mom teaching, Sophie in pre-school, Madeline in kindergarten + afterschool and dad being a nerd at work.  The next time we catch our breath will find the early Spring flowers in bloom.

      Nascar:  Jimmy Johnson won some race at Darlington.      Nascar has become something akin to professional baseball for me; the season is too long and there are too many races I just don't care about.  Give the crews a rest and save us from ourselves.      IRL:  Tony Kanaan blitzes the field in Phoenix.  Nascar-lite heads to Japan next.      F1:  Michael Schumacher proves that last year's championship chase was an aberration, as he clinches victory number two this season, in Malaysia.    NHRA:  With the exception of Pro Stock ("Calling Greg Anderson to the Victory Podium..."), the professional classes in the NHRA offer what I consider to be the most competitive racing around.  Top Fuel, Funny Car and Pro Stock Bike are literally "up for grabs" on any race weekend.      Tony Schumacher (no relation to his F1 brethren) pounded out a win in Top Fuel.    Del Worsham iced John Force, beating him with a hole shot in Funny Car, and Andrew Hines introduced Harley-Davidson to the Winners Circle, by deliverying a Wally in the Pro Stock Bike competition.    OWRS/CART:  I'm not sure what's up with the OWRS.  They will either pleasantly surprise everyone with an 18 car field at Long Beach (less than a month away) or they will implode after the defections of Fernandez and Rahal to the IRL.

      We're getting the girls dressed on Friday morning, for school.  Sophie and Madeline both seem to be on the Miracle-Gro diet, getting taller right before our eyes.    I commented to Sophie how tall she was getting, noticing the pants we purchased in the Fall were starting to get short on her.    "My pants are growing out of me!"    Kids rule.

      The Ann Arbor Ladybugs took to the field on Saturday against the Ann Arbor Penguins.    The girls tried valiantly, but we found ourselves on the short side of the scoring column, falling 3-1.    On the plus side, we found the net...and the girls celebrated accordingly.    After two games and a single practice (last week's rained out), it's amazing how quickly the different skills and abilities of the team become apparent.    There are some girls who just love defense, meeting the oppponents outside the goalie box, defending the "castle."  Other girls take to being goalie, going after the ball with their hands, while others love being on offense, trying to get the ball up the field.    And there are other girls who couldn't give a rats behind about scoring, but they love being out there with their friends and that's fun as heck to watch too.

      Yikes.     Almost two weeks between entries.  That's lame.    I started this blog to:    - Give me an outlet to talk, about anything.  I'm never at a loss for words and I figured I could start sharing my thoughts here.    - Work on my writing.  Granted, no Pulitzer awaits my future, but I have always enjoyed the well written word and I may as well try to improve my own.    - It beats pounding my fist on the table when I'm pissed about something.  Writing here may motivate me, or possibly you, to get involved with something that's important to you, instead of just complaining about it.    Chris

      Condoleezza Rice, the National security advisor to Dubya, will FINALLY meet with the 9/11 commission on Thursday, in PUBLIC.    Ms. Rice is employed by the same White House that saw fit to thrust her in front of every Sunday morning talk show in an effort to discredit former White House counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke.      The same White House that tried to use the separation of powers to explain away why Rice should not have to testify publicly.    The same Rice that appeared on Face the Nation, 60 Minutes, penned an item for the Washington Post, spoke to seemingly any interviewer within camera range; but somehow she still saw fit to stuck to her guns that she should not speak publicly with the very commission investigating possible intelligence failures surrounding the 9/11 attacks.    Me thinks the MTV generation has hit the White House.  Condoleezza Rice is comfortable speaking to America on her terms, but she is seemingly dumbstruck that the same public that voted her boss' administration into office would ask her to speak to them on their terms.    welcome to the big time.    Rice, Rice, baby...

      Okay, so technically no score is kept, but the Lady Bugs lost to the Cardinals 2-nil.    I screwed up in a major way by having us go the wrong park first...that was lovely.  A gaggle of relatives lead astray.      Fortunately, the game started late and we made it to the correct field just prior to the start of the second quarter.      Madeline jumped right on in on offense.  I'm subjective, but the girl has got some wheels.      Next game is not until after the Easter holiday...

      Attention:  The following is NOT an April Fools' prank I have pulled on myself.  Everything you are reading here is real; please do not attempt this yourselves, unless under the proper supervision of kindergartners.      The Ann Arbor Ladybugs of the Ann Arbor Parks and Rec League open up play this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Las Vegas Park.    Being an assistant coach for a team full of kindergartners means...    1 - I know nothing about soccer, but this should be fun.    2 - I get to be called Coach Chris by a bunch of kids.    3 - Our house is now a soccer field, both indoors and outdoors.    4 - We are the proud owners of a regulation-size, pink soccer ball.

      Pay attention.    Saturday: rest up for Sunday.    Sunday:    7:30 a.m. - European Grand Prix - Speedvision.  Monaco was an abberation.  Michael wipes the floor.    12 o'clock - Indianapolis 500 - ABC TV.  Can't help but watch this race, but don't expect any shockers.  Another CART-bred team will win (think orange and white).    4 p.m. - NHRA Summer Nationals - ESPN2 - the fueler categories are providing the best show this season.    5 p.m. - Coca-Cola 600 - Fox TV - hope it doesn't rain, otherwise you won't go to bed until well after midnight.  Watch one or two cars lap the entire field in this beast of a race.      Monday:  Sleep in, thank a Veteran and enjoy the day.

      Okay, I suck at updating.  I have to get on the ball.    ----    Today marks the sixth straight day of some sort of rain.      Madeline and Sophie have had a crash course in dealing with tornado warnings, lighting, thunder and lots and lots and lots of rain.    Thursday night/Friday morning found us hitting the basement after the tornado sirens went off.  Hard not to hear the whail as the pole is located about 75 feet from our house, along the side street.    Friday afternoon found a sky turning black, just blacker than black, followed by green...hello, God, is that you?  I expected the sirens to go off again, but they did not.      Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday night and Sunday morning had additional thunderstorms rumbling through the area.    We were lucky.  No flooding, only minor tree branches down and no loss of power.  Other Michiganders to the east and north are still without power and find their neighborhoods and homes still flooded.    Anybody selling a used ark, cheap?

Today marks her 4th birthday, celebrated in style at daycare by making sugar cookies, singing, yelling and general carrying-on.    Afterwards, she insisted on a trip to Chuck E. Cheese, a bastion to bad food, soda pop and lots and lots of carnival and video games.      A few dozen tokens later found she and Madeline the proud owners of some glitter make-up and something else that we'll trip on tomorrow.

      The Ladybugs scored their first two goals of the season on Saturday, in a well-played 2-2 match against the Sting Rays.    Meira scored both of the teams' goals, booming the ball into the net twice.    The Ladybugs are becoming much more confident on the field, playing tougher defense, better goal and going after the ball more on offense.    Whooo hooooooooooo!!!!!

       Swimming lessons started this week for Madeline and Sophie.    They are now both officially part of the fish family - largely aquatic creatures who only come out of the water for food and to use the restroom.    A funny thing about summer, now that it's our first "schoool break" summer, is how we are probably as busy as during the school year. Weekends find birthday parties for various little creatures, practices, working in the yard, etc. The daily stress of everybody rushing out the door is on hold, which is nice.    If anybody's looking to hire a teacher, hire my wife,  urlLink Lisa .

       Today marks Election Day in a lot of area communities and school districts.    Here in Ann Arbor there are two proposals on the ballot that have drawn a lot of attention. Both of these items are school-related, and in total, would lead to building renovations at ALL district schools, a new pre-k facility, new buses, new musical instruments, and most importantly, a NEW HIGH SCHOOL!!!    So, in the spirit of the upcoming 2004 Federal elections, Vote Early and Vote Often.

       As a parent, today marks one of those days where I sit back and say to myself "Wow, did time fly by!"    Madeline finished her first year of school today, with her last day of Kindergarten at the Ann Arbor Open School.      Like the second bookend, today's last day of school was a rainy, drizzly day; a perfect match to Madeline's first day of kindergarten back in August.    I'm floored at how quickly the time went by. If any parents read this and you're told by someone, "enjoy it because it goes by so quickly," it's true. I cannot believe the school year is over.    Here's to summer madness!

      Yes, I'm a pathetic parent and asst. coach of the Ann Arbor LadyBugs...but after a Spring of almost no goals, and definitely no wins, the LadyBugs won two games this weekend!!!    The girls played very hard; everybody really seemed to just "get it" this weekend and played their little hearts out.      Madeline really got going on offense, scoring two goals in each game, and Claire and Meira also found the back of the net.      A great end to a fun season.  Watch out for us in the Fall.

The six feet tall lawn doesn't need anymore water!    This weekend is the last for the Lady Bugs this season.  Maybe we'll get that first win.    The Dexter-Ann Arbor runs are this Sunday.  Lisa and I are signed up for the 5K.  I haven't run since the temps were below freezing, so this ought to be interesting.    Go outside!

      President Bush is back on the campaign trail, apparently with a new "theme."    A  urlLink story on cnn.com  quotes the new refrain as "we've turned a corner, and we're not turning back."    Hello?  Turned a corner?  The Republicans have a month before their convention to go hog wild with how Bush is the better choice and the best they can come up with is "We've turned a corner."    Turned a corner from what?    The economy is still sketchy.    Soliders are still dying in Iraq.    Osama bin Laden is still making poor recordings denouncning the US of A.    I think the new refrain should be "We've slipped off the curb."    Anybody got a band-aid for Dubya?

Lots of set changes, many dancers, elaborate routines, and, unfortunately, for me, more of Madonna infusing her political/social schtick amongst an arrangement of songs that are best enjoyed without being tied to recent news headlines.    Ignoring the political stuff (Madonna, stay out of movies and don't run for office), the show, it's not a concert, was very well done.    On our drive back home, Lisa remarked that we seem to be on an 80's music reunion tour, having attended Duran Duran back in the Fall and Prince earlier this summer, along with Madonna. Can the impossible happen next? Will The Police re-unite, so I can finally see them live?

And I still could have served it up at a party on November 12, 2005.  Should I thank NASA?  Will Greenpeace protest?
