						      Looky there, I turned the "She Spies" logo into a "She Spies Sucks" logo. This is really old, but I thought I would show people that haven't seen it.

						   I can't believe that Pepsi has this whole crock of shit about appealing to Hispanic people. Not only that, but the problem is that they go out of their way to put the word "si" in their product with the thought that this is going to make Hispanics think Pepsi is amazing.  If you put "yes" next to the word Fanta on a can, it wouldn't make me want to drink only Fanta for the rest of my life.  Then you have the fact that the product hasn't changed at all, it's just the word "si" on the label. It's obvious that Pepsi is so dumb that they think Hispanics are easily won over by having Spanish next to the word Pepsi.  In the political campaigns, even though there are commercials for the canidates in Spanish, the Spanish speakers say that they will want to understand the issues and that a language will not just win over their vote.  So maybe Pepsi can realize this, stop being stupid, and drop all the crap.

						   Man, I hate getting sick. I mean, it's hard enough for me to sleep during the night, having a headache and stuffed up nose doesn't help any. I'm gonna make love to the person that comes up with a cure for the common cold (considering it's a woman (considering she's hot)).  Does anyone know how I got sick during the summer anyway? That's never happend to me before, I dunno why.  Due to the fact that I stay up so late, I've started watching "Hawaii 5-0". It's pretty badass, almost as badass as "Matlock".  I figure if I get a vacuum and put it in my nostrils, they will finally clear up. That would be badass.

						   Holy crap, it's gonna rain for forever. I wish it would stop.  I fell asleep really early last night, so I didn't update since I worked at Sonic for a while.  Next update is going to be better than this one.  Jay Leno rules.

						   Man, I love turkey sandwiches. They might just be the greatest thing ever invented AND consumed. Sorry to you vegetarians and turkeys out there, but you're either too edible and/or unable to eat the awesomeness that is a turkey sandwich.  Every time I go to a place that serves turkey sandwiches (especially Chilli's) I order it. I mean, I prolly could survive in the middle of nowhere with no human contact if I had an infinite amount of turkey sandwiches. As sad as this may sound, eating a turkey sandwich makes my day.  You should know, however, that that isn't sad because turkey sandwiches kick ass.  I saw "Dodgeball" today, and Chuck Norris was in it. So I recommend that you watch it, because Chuck Norris is the badest ass person ever, and he makes the movie totally worth it.  Also, the movie's pretty funny.

						   I dunno if it's all the day time TV that I've been watching this summer (which is ironic because it comes on late at night), but I'm slowly realizing that old people are freakin awesome. At least the ones on TV anyway.  Two people come to mind, Matlock (Andy Griffith) and Bob Barker. Trust me, I haven't lost my mind.  You see, Matlock is the badass who doesn't quit, and doesn't lose. Consider him the Justin Timberlake of senior citizens. Not only is he the only old person that cusses, but nobody ever beats Matlock. He's clever too, and if he was a boxer, he would be the heavyweight champion of the world.    "Matlock being happy because he kick ass."  Bob Barker is a badass too. He never gets pissed off, even though there are total gits on "The Price is Right". On top of this, he's witty in spite of the fact that he should be senile. Just about everyone knows who Bob Barker is, cuz he's on the best game show ever. It's totally awesome.    "Bob Barker can put up with shit like there's no tomorrow."  In conclusion, respect old people because not only are they badass, but they can surf, do extreme sports, and jam out to heavy metal music.

						   Man, I love Sunday nights during Summer. It's because the TV shows totally rock on Sunday nights. Actually, they rock starting Sunday evenings with "The Simpsons", but night time is funner to watch TV, because you know you're not missing anything.  I usually start at 10 p.m. watching either Fox 4's sports show, or a rerun of "The Simpsons". Whichever is better. Then I go to channel 4 to watch Seinfeld. Man that show rocks.  After an hour of that, I sometimes watch "Dharma and Greg" even though it's not always that great. Either that or more sports shows.  At 12 a.m. I go to channel 11 to watch this dumb show call "Unexplained Mysteries". It's so stupid, because it always talks about either psychics, ghosts, healers, or aliens. Either way, it's still interesting seeing all the dumb talk.  At 1 a.m. one of the best shows man has ever known comes on. "Walker, Texas Ranger". Holy shit, that show rules so much. I mean, Chuck Norris kicks ass like there's no tomorrow. Not to mention that he was also a 6 time karate world champion. If that doesn't kick ass, then I don't know what does.    "Chuck Norris: a total badass."  2 a.m. is generally when I take a shower.  2:30 is when I watch "Hot Ticket", even though I hate movie critics. They're never right because the movies they say are good usually suck ass, and the movies they say are bad usually kick ass. However, they usually talk about movie history, so it's interesting.  That's why Sunday nights kick ass.

						   Once again, a clever title because this post is about the rules of Chess, but also, Chess is a game that rules.  I was looking on the internet yesterday for chess rules, because I noticed when I play people, hardly anyone knows where to really put the Queen, and I wanted to show them that I'm right. Turns out, I was right because the light Queen goes on the light space, and the dark Queen goes on the dark space. I guess I showed those punks.  The interesting thing though is that there was a rule I wasn't aware about. It's called "En Passat" and it has to do with Pawns. What the rule is is that if a Pawn moved 2 spaces forward on its first move, and your Pawn is next to it, then you can capture the Pawn by moving it behind the Pawn that moved 2 spaces. You can only do this the turn immediately following the first Pawn's movement though.     The dot is where the black Pawn can go to capture that jerk the white Pawn for his 2 space first turn movement. That'll show those crackers.

						   Television lately is starting to make me really happy and piss me off at the same time. Probably due to the fact that it's the show that makes up how good television is, not what type of television you're watching. Well, it could be the type of television you're watching, but probably not due to the fact that most televisions work pretty well.  First of all, NBC is pissing me off because they're slowly sapping up all of their shows. Every time they advertise for "Freinds" (which is over with...) and "Who Wants to Marry my Dad?", it's always some crappy, mushy piano music or song that plays during the commercial. As if this wasn't enough, the announcer who is talking about the show talks like his girlfriend of 10 years just broke up with him.  I swear, NBC is slowly turning to a chick-channel.  On a lighter note, I've slowly become infatuated with infomercials. I can't tell why, because it's always the same song that plays for 30 minutes while the infomercial airs. Even though I'm sick of the get rich quick ones, I love the ones with products. They usually try to make it kind of interesting. Also, infomercials are just high energy; very different from the sap that NBC puts out.  In conclusion, I need a life because I'm talking about TV.

						   That's what I've been eating lately because there's nothing else to have in my house. It's not as bad as green olives though. Just in case you don't know, green olives taste like crap.  This is the second time I've written this post, due to the fact that my crappy ass computer crashed. I hate my computer more than anything in the world, even though I use it a whole lot.  I'm sorry about the lame posts I've been having lately, it's because I keep getting up at 4:30, and I'm too tired and don't have the time to write anything clever. Here's a picture you can look at in the mean time:     Feast your eyes upon intelligent life in outer space....  Don't forget to leave comments about how amazingly attractive I am, because we all know I am.

						   WARNING:  This post has nothing clever in it, so if you think it's lame, then you're prolly right.  Man, I'm watching the Lakers game, and I'm wondering how they managed to suck it up so much recently. Oh well, it's too late because I bet the Pistons will win the title tonight. It's not often great teams like the Lakers screw it up.  I wish I could own a sports team, that would be totally awesome. Only a football team though, maybe hockey. I dunno why really, it just seems like it would be badass. It would suck if the team is bad, but when the team is good, man, that's totally sweet. Especially if you get as good as the Dallas Cowboys from the early and mid 1990s. That would rule like there's no tomorrow.  I also think it's badass when you walk into a teams club house, or like, a school's music hall or something and see a shit load of trophies. I mean, even if you're bad, a lot of trophies still make people respect you.  Back to my point, the Dallas Cowboys of the 1990s kicked so much ass. I wish they could be that good again, but with the salary cap, I don't think it can happen. That would still kick ass though. I mean, NOBODY could take on the cowboys except the San Francisco 49ers. Even then, the Cowboys still won 3 out of 4 titles from 1993-1996.  Either way, I think the lakers time as a dynasty is over. Who knows though, maybe the Bill Parcells of basketball will come back and try and rebuild it.

						   I had my hopes high for the "WB Super Star" show that's been on this summer. It had the potential to be the crappy networks best show because the vast majority of their major shows suck like no tomorrow.  The season finale was airing tonight, and I figured they were totally gonna lay waste to the person who won. I mean, these people are so bad, it's obvious they've never taken anyone's comments into consideration. They just live in their own little world thinking they can make it without getting help.  When it finally came to tell the winner, Jaime, that she can't sing, they totally buttered it up. Not only this, but they gave her a contract anyway and $100,000!  "Treating people equally when they're clearly not equal is what, class? COMMUNISM!"  I got that quote from "The Simpsons" where Lisa takes dancing lessons.  Never the less, it proves a point, and it's that we've started to reward people for sucking it up. Now, giving her money for being a good sport is fine, but a singing contract? What the hell? Wasn't she just declared the worst singer in America?  Not only this, but they sugared it up so much, the poor stupid girl probably still thinks she's good and wasn't just declared the worst singer in the world.  You may ask yourself, "Why the hell is Grant watching the WB???"  Well, it's because it's summer and I have nothing better to do.

						   "No offense, but you're a douchebag." "No offense, but you're ugly as hell." "No offense, but you can't do (random activity) worth shit."  Honestly, what kind of idiot doesn't take offense in comments like these? Trust me, saying "no offense" doesn't get rid of any negative comments effects, and it sure doesn't soften the blow. Also, if the comment isn't offensive to begin with, then saying "no offense" is meaningless.  The Way People Think You'll React when they say "No offense, but..": "Man, I'm a dumbass. That sure was comical when you made an insult at me and/or made fun of me for one of my foibles. Did I mention I'm a dumbass? My hobbies include eating wood and having sex with knives."  The Way People Really React when somebody says to them "No offense, but..": "Screw you dickweed."  When you just joke and say "no offense", then it's ok, because people know saying "no offense" is stupid. When people really use it and think saying "no offense" will all of a sudden mean that insults won't piss people off, then they're just being dipshits.  If you like saying "no offense, but..." then do me a favor and don't forget to go to hell.

						   Last night I had this really strange dream about the Lakers and the Pistons. What happened is I was in the living room watching TV, and the Lakers were playing a game and were totally kicking the Pistons ass. However, the location of the game was in the gym at my old elementary school. Not to mention that, besides Shaq and Kobe, the only players in the game were teenagers.  The dream started getting strange when the next thing I knew was that I was in the game playing for the Lakers. There was a problem however, and it was that I suck at basketball like there's no tomorrow.  When it came for my turn to get the basketball, I couldn't grab hold of it because the ball was bouncing too much. Everyone in the crowd was laughing at me.  Is this a prophecy that might come true someday?  No, obviously not. Not because the game was on the gym in my elementary school, but because the Lakers were beating the crap out of the Pistons. We all know that's never going to happen if the Lakers don't pull their heads out of their cocky asses, which they seem to have trouble doing.

						   I woke up at about 11:30 to the sound of my brother yelling and hitting at the wall for this bird that got into my house via my cat to go out. It was nuts, eventually it left though.  Normally I would be glad to wake up at any time before noon, however the night before I was up till about 6 in the morning due to nasty ass acid reflux. It was probably due to the chili and pizza I had for dinner, but man it sure did suck ass.  When I woke up my mouth felt like an exhaust pipe. It should probably prompt me to eat better, but I'm a teenager so screw it. I'll deal, and probably drink more water since that kind of helps.  For some reason, this makes me think of people complaining. Actually, it does because I'm complaining about my heartburn. Either way, it drives me nuts when people say that their life sucks. I mean really, it could be a lot worse, just because you don't have a date or you have to go school doesn't mean your life sucks, it just means that you have a couple of problems that suck.  Next time I hear somebody say that their life sucks, I'm gonna kick them in the balls. Either that or I'll just stop talking to them. I'll probably flip a coin on it.

						   Damn, today I was at the mall for like 2 hours, and we ate food. I had McDonalds. Some people don't like McDonalds, but I don't care, because the problems I'll encounter from it won't come back to haunt me for 20 so odd years.  Then Ross bought me another piece for the chess board I'm making, props to Ross for that. When I finish the chess set, he'll be the first one to see it.  So long story short, Marvin has 18 pens: 12 are black ones and 6 are blue ones.    "King Hottie"  Bow before King Hottie, because he is King Hottie!!!!

						   I'm going to write about what happened to me today for a change, and if you don't like it, then I don't care.  I decided to get together with Craig since nobody was home yesterday. We were playing Othello (which is a badass game) and then he told me about the G.I. Joe videos everybody has been watching lately.  I decided to look for them on Google, and behold, they were there in all of their glory.  All I have to say is HOLY SHIT, those are the funniest things I've ever seen in my life, and I'm not even joking. If you haven't been exposed to them, then you haven't really lived.  What they are are the educational segments at the end of G.I. Joe episodes, but the voices have been dubbed over.    http://www.ebaumsworld.com/gijoe.html http://www.fenslerfilm.com/?sec=video  Go to the website right now and watch the videos, because they're funny as hell. Make sure you watch them from the bottom up though, because those are the best ones.  Note: After writing this post, several people have made it evident that Fensler Film, the original creators of the movies, have a complete collection. They, of course, were right, so I'm putting their site on as well. Keep in mind, however, that it's harder to find a specific clip on the Fensler Film site, even though they have them all.

						   When I say Jay Leno hasn't had any good guest on lately, I meant it. Last night, he had Lindsay Lohan, probably the stupidest teenage star since all the other teenagers that have become stars and then ended up becoming drunks 10 years down the road.  Thank god that the Lakers-Pistons game went into an exciting overtime, or I might have just ended up going to bed at 11 last night, seeing as how I'm very uncreative when it comes to engaging in activity.  Back to my point, teenage celebrities shouldn't exist. One, they're too damn stupid and horny to know anything. Two, they aren't even adults, making their earnings mostly stolen by their parents. Three, they can't act. When was the last time a teenager got an Oscar for their performance?     Look at that, I showed her by putting a red X on her face. Now she'll think twice before making stupid movies.  The thing that probably pisses me off the most about her is the fact that she's so fake. She has this terrible tan. Here's a rule of life:  red heads shouldn't be tan, otherwise they'll look bad. I swear, when I look at her it's like seeing carrot-zila coming to attack.  In conclusion, don't look up to Lindsay Lohan. Why? Well because she's a jerk-face and I decided to write about her in my random boredom.

						   The title is clever because this post has to do with my head and rhymes with my last name.  Last night when I was trying to get some sleep, I notice a strange sound. Every time I would touch my ear, the sound would continue, as if something was in my ear shaking around, which was totally weird. I tried digging something out, and after a while, the sound just stopped.  It was really strange, but since it's over with, I figure it couldn't have been that bad anyway.  I also figure I'm gonna let my beard grow until I have to go into public, just to see what it looks like. I mean, lots of badasses have beards, like Chuck Norris.  If you aren't satisfied with this post because it's not funny or clever, then too bad, because I don't have anything else to write about for the moment. Instead you can e-mail Chuck Norris and tell him how awesome he is.

						   I'm sitting here watching Jay Leno's show, and I realize that he hasn't had many good guests on lately. What ever happened to people like Donald Trump?     I know the picture of him is a little young, but this guy is a total badass. I mean, not only is he one of the richest people on the planet, but he also owns his own helicopter and has a jewel encrusted apartment. I mean, how does it get better than that? The answer is that it doesn't.  Anyone who is famous for firing people is amazing. Most celebrities are washed up, sappy, boring cry babies that get too much attention. Mainly you can see they gain fame for winning reality TV shows, being fashion designers, or sneaking into things like the Oscars. Donald Trump completely dwarfs them, because he's famous for being so damn rich and totally awesome.  If you don't believe me, then Donald Trump is probably sending his own personal SWAT team to your house right now to come and take you and erase everyone's memory of your existence. (Some people may not believe the memory erasing thing, but Donald Trump has so much money, you wouldn't believe what he has.)

						   So I wake up this morning and my brother is watching Trigun for the 80th time, so instead of watch it while I eat my cereal in the living room, I pick up a copy of the magazine "Redbook" that's in our house for some reason or another.  For those of you who don't know, it's some magazine that tells women stuff about life, sex, and, most importantly, the nature of men.  One article was particularly stupid. It talked about annoying things men do and why they do them so much. For example, men channel surf because they want dominance and control of their lives, and channel surfing helps fulfill that desire.  Did it ever occur to you that men channel surf because they're looking for something good on television? I mean, sure a TV Guide tells you what's on, but it won't say how much you like it. Besides, it's not like women don't channel surf as well.  I swear, there are just some things on this planet that just don't need analysis.

						        Summer started getting boring, so I'm doing this blog thing for a while. This isn't the Japanese Seizure Robots link that I tricked you guys with, so you can enjoy what I write here. I don't care if you read this or not, because it helps me pass the time.       Anyway, I can't get this little "About Me" section to work right, so if you know how to work it, then let me know. And if you know how to work it and you don't want to let me know, then go to hell.   Well, that's kinda harsh, so go to hell for about 5 minutes.       Also, send this to anyone you know that knows me, because I'm gonna make this thing badass, I just haven't had the time that much right now.

						   I was watching the news the other day and there was some sort of report about how kids drink too much soda and it's bad for them. One fact was that if you drank more than 3 or 4 sodas a week then you were about 80% more likely to get diabetes then those of kids that don't.    In light of these recent facts that I have learend, I've come to this conclusion: I am soon going to die.    As the title implies, I do, in fact, drink a whole shit load of soda. So, I leave all of my belongings to my brother, except I donate my trumpet to Arturo Sandoval, so that he can revel in all of my glory.     Well, no, I'm just kidding because Arturo Sandoval could kick my ass with a cork in his mouth.    So, in conclusion, I won't write my will just yet due to the fact that tons of other kids drink soda and they haven't died yet. Maybe I should calm down my daily intake though....    Nah.

						   When I was speaking of those founding fathers yesterday, I forgot all about one badass in particular.  He wasn't a founding father, but he owns the copyright to kicking ass. His name is General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Oh man, I'm sure that guy could kick anyone's ass in a war. He's so damn crunk.    Maybe most of you think that I've lost my mind right about now. Those people just don't want to admit that Ike kicks ass.  I mean, he's a military genius, what more do you people want in somebody to idolize?         How can you say this person doesn't totally rule? It would just be unamerican.

						   Oh man, I was watching Sunday morning cartoons yesterday (they still exist, they're just very seldomly seen) and there was one awesome ass show, "Liberty's Kids". If you don't know, Liberty's Kids are badass little bitches that go around learning things about the Revolutionary War. They're journalists for Ben Franklin's newspaper and every event that goes down you get to see a British and American side.    Now I don't like little kids that much, actually, I don't like them at all. However, "Liberty's Kids" is awesome because it tries to get kids to look up to people like George Washington. None of these gay contemporary heroes like Static Shock, Mucha Lucha, or Pokémon. Just some good old fashion Generals and founding fathers. Wouldn't that kick ass if every little kid idolized people like George Washington? Holy shit, then we would live in a utopia.         If I'm ever a parent, all I'm going to let my kid watch on TV is "Liberty's Kids".

						    I wonder why people always write down entire songs on their "whatever it is they like to write on". I'm pretty sure nobody reads them. Wouldn't it be easier to write down the title of the song and how it makes you feel as opposed to copying the whole lyrics down? I know there would be more of a purpose to that.     It's even worse when the words don't rhyme. Then you're just reading a half-ass story about some song writer with lots of mean words. Almost like poetry written by a 3rd grader.     Is it just me, or does writing down a whole song make your "whatever it is a person likes to write on" look tacky? Take this for example...     The Big Ass   by: Ass Face      I hate  my life   and   EVERYTHING THAT'S IN IT.   So I...   Found my ass, and  found that   it was big.      OHHHHHHH   my ass is big   my ASS is  BIG   My ass is so damn really   big?      Whenever I look into the  eyes of the   mirror   I see a big ass.   That's   right.   By the way  my   life sucks.      So I killed myself and everyone di   dn't care.       So then I killed myself again.   Except my ass was too big and full  of fat.   So the bullet bounced right off.      As you can see in Example A, the song is boring to read and looks dumb written down. That's why it was made to be a song and not a diary entry.

						   Has anyone ever seen that freakin awesome guy Ken play Jeopardy lately? If you haven't you should. That guy is so fucking awesome it's unbelieveable that he's not cheating.  So far, he's been champion for 33 days with winning over $1,100,400. That's more than 99% of people win on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?".  Nobody stands a chance against that guy. Seriously, today he had $50,000 at the end while the closest person to him had about $6,000. It's not even a contest. I wonder if they'll let him play Jeopardy forever. That would be totally sweet.

						   Band names are stupid, completely randomly put together words to identify a group of musicians. I've made a list of potential names for bands that you can use. Feel free to take these, this post is public domain.  The Pissed Off Toilet Seats Bloobywhore Razorweed's Vial of Death The Popped Top Grasshopper's Drink Cards of Loving Hate Crappy Fluid Dr. Cebvil Extension Cord Madness Mail Woman Plastic Rap Cee Dee The Raving Mad Truck Tires Age of Dirt Slack Jawed Spark Plugs Ba Overheated Ice Cubes The Loud Pacifist Crazy Mr. Iraqi Dictator Grant Has Large Goolies and a Large Thang Tin Cans of Rock Candle Wick Over Assortment of Papers Bob's Band of Flying Death Angels that Kill everything and Show No Mercy Seattle  I bet in 10 years all of those will be rock bands that I won't get any royalties from because I let this post be public domain.

						   I haven't updated this in a long damn time. It's for a good reason though, I've been living like a hermit, locked up in my room playing Final Fantasy VII all over again. I've gone half way through the game in a couple of days, so that's a whole shit load of playing. I'm suprised my playstation has not overheated.  On another note, I'm going to use roman numerals for everything I write that's a number. All the swoll people do that. It's really masculine too.  So if you catch me using arabic numerals, then you can point it out to me and call me a pussy. Well, until school starts anyway, because doing math would be a bitch with roman numerals. Also, I think my teachers would take off for that.  By the way, if you're a hot girl then I have Friday nights open so we can get it on. Just thought you would like to know.

						   I'm so sick of updating this thing because of the fact that it involves me restarting my computer about 100 times to get anything posted. It's not that I don't enjoy blogging, even though it sounds dumb, it's just that my shitty ass computer screws up every time I try and put something on the internet.  I can't tell why either, other than the fact that my computer is a piece of shit. On average, it takes me about 30 min to 90 min to update my blog. Most of that time is spent re-writing articles and wating for my crappy computer to restart. It really pisses me off.  Either way, I'm going to keep putting stuff up, but you should like it because it's a pain in the ass to write something.  If you want a joke, then how about this one:  Knock Knock Who's there? Richard. Richard who? Richard Simmons is gay!

						   I'm going to leave you people with this piece of advice to keep in mind.  "I give the furniture multiple orgasms just by sitting on it."  I got this from "Blackadder" which I saw last night. It's pretty funny.

						   I never noticed this until last night when I was watching "Last Call with Carson Daily", but John Mayer looks just like me. He has the same type of facial features and hair, minus the big cheeks.  Don't believe me?  Look at this.     The ones on the left are me, and the ones on the right are John Mayer. Keep in mind there are very few pictures of me, so I couldn't find me in the positions that he's in, but it's close enough.  This leads me to only one conclusion: since he's a girl magnet and heart throb, then I can only assume that I am gorgeous as well. I already knew this, but it proves it.  So, next time you're a girl and you want to be on my gorgeous body, then keep in mind that it's just like being with John Mayer, which will make me even more attractive. Man, I'm hot.

						   Once again, my piece of shit computer fucked up so this is the second time I've written this post.  I wish they would make television sitcoms the way they used to, like back in the late 80s to mid 90s. Those were the best. Not to mention actually funny.  The problem is that everyone is trying to make an instant hit, and they fail to realize in the midst of all that bullshit advertising with shitty ass music that sitcoms are supposed to be funny. There's always some big shot star that just fails because it's not big stars who make the show good. It's the writing.  All the good comedies I'm talking about stared no names who made it to the top for being funny, not movie actors or washed up actors that want another job. Trust me, it always fails.  Also, importing shows from other countries and trying to make them American fails too. That "Coupling" show was terrible. Except I'll give it some credit because the British version was terrible too. I hope that show burns in hell forever.  Anyway, my point is that stupid damn executives that have rods up their asses with rods up their asses don't know how to get things done anymore, and it's making TV more of a shit box now than it ever was.

						   NOTE: This is the third fucking time that I’ve written this fucking piece of shit post because my god damn fucking computer keeps fucking up on me. When I get a new one someday, I’m going to take this one and throw it off of Stanridge Stadium and laugh at it’s piece-of-shit-oscity. Not to mention that my computer was made by some mother fucker who prolly used rubber bands and old Dukes of Hazard Lunch boxes.  NOW, let’s hope this fucking works. I wanted to let people know about how awesome the Rocky series is and that if they haven’t seen it then they’re missing out. I’m pretty sure Rocky set the standard for beating the shit out of people.     There are some things that most people don’t know about Rocky. First off, you could break cement on his rock hard abs. I say this because I’m confident in my straight, manly way of life. Secondly, Rocky, Jay Leno, Matlock, and Donald Trump all get together on Friday nights to play Blackjack and discuss how awesome they are. Nobody ever wins because they’re all unbeatable at everything.  In my book, Rocky has the world record for beating ass to a bloody pulp. A record which will never be broken.

						   Has anyone ever played that SNES game Starfox? If you haven't, then this post will probably suck. But if you have, then you should know what I'm talking about if you're not Freddy Kruger.  The point that I'm trying to make is that Starfox is fucking creepy. Not the N64 version, but the original. I mean, come on, those voices scare the shit out of me. Not to mention that psycho music that sounds like somebody with a chain saw is about to cut your head off.  If I ever grow up to be a jackass, I'm gonna make my kids play Starfox as a punishment so that they'll have nightmares.
