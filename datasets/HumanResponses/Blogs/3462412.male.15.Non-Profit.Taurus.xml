      Well I'm back.  Sorry for no update last night, I was really worn out.  We swam and stuff.  We catapulted my cousin Jessie off the back of a trailer.  That was pretty much it.

      Well, I'm going to my aunt's for a cookout.  Apparently, the pool is too dirty/filled with chemicals/my uncle is too lazy for us to swim.  Knowing all of us, we'll suffer the chemical burns just for the cheap thrill of swimming.  And of course,  we'll play kick the can in the pool barn and I'll be hiding in the best spot ever and then I'll suddenly see a huge spider and scream "OH GOD THAT SPIDER IS HUGE" and be "it".  That's how it goes.  And of course my little cousin Jessie will get yelled at for some reason (like he always does).  And my other cousin will start pouting because she's it, and I'll eat WAY too much,  and some other funny thing will happen.  Which reminds me of a story.   Well, it was when I was about 9 or 10, and there was a big storm so we had to go inside.  So my cousin Dan and I are sitting in some bedroom, looking out the window at some other members of my family who were outside, when my cousin Sherri (who we all used to hate for some reason) runs across the cement with her hands up, and we see this flash of lightning that looks as though it hit her.  We were out for like 10 minutes cracking up.  It sounds evil and mean, I know.  It was.

      Well, R.J. is back.  IF you don't know who he is, I'll fill you in.  R.J. is Mike's and my best bud who unfortunatley moved to Korea 4 years ago.  He's back. For good.  Anyway, this one time, we made this movie where R.J. was in the foreground pretending to be Britany Spears dancing on a chair.  I was in the background flying across the basement on one of those office chairs with wheels.  Well I smashed into the mattress that my dad slept on (he wasnt home)  and was bounced up into the air.  Then I landed on the arm of the chair, with one leg on either side of the chair.  ouchy.  It was really funny. I rode down the basement stairs on a mattresss while wearing a somberero one time.  That was funny.  Which reminds me of a movie  urlLink Mike  and I made.  I'll skip to the funny part.  I was wearing a Santa outfit.  He was beating me over the head with my beanbag chair.  I crawled to the other part of my basement, got up, grabbed a broom, and ran around behind him (my basement circles around) and yelled  "You suck!"  He screamed like a 6 year old girl would scream if you came out of her closet in a Freddy Krueger outfit.  It was hilarious.

      Sorry for not updating in a while.  I've been busy with my summer.  Well it's the 14th. R.J. will be back anytime now.  I'm working on a new rocket and stuff.  Uh, I now have a job as a "Lawn Care Specialist".   I bought "Live Aus Berlin"  that one live Rammstein CD.  I'll try to update more, but you know how it is.  I'm usually really busy in the summer doing summer stuff and whatnot.  I'll post some pictures sometime.  Later.

      You want pictures? I'll give you pictures. And just a reminder, if you don't agree with anything on my site, don't come to the site. There's no reason to be here if you don't like it. And it's not like you're getting through to me, the only reason I'll be posting pictures (when I get them from  urlLink Mike  [I don't have the movie on my computer, he has it]) is to produce valid evidence that the incident did indeed happen, and that the scream in question was the girliest scream imaginable.  In fact if I had more bandwidth and space, (and the video itself) I would post it on the site.  But for now you'll just have to settle for pictures.  I'll probably be taking the comments down since some people aren't mature to handle them without parental supervision.

      Well I've started to notice some odd comments on this blog so I'll just say this.&nbsp; If you don't agree with the things I say or do or write, then don't come back.&nbsp; It's not really you're problem or business what I do with my own time on my own blog.&nbsp;And there's nothing you can do to stop me from&nbsp;posting strange and unusual things each and every day.&nbsp; Any comment you make I'll just delete, and if you make enough I'll just turn off the comments for good.&nbsp; You're just like the one little kid that shoots someone in the eyes with a squirtgun, causing all the other kids to have their squirtguns taken away.&nbsp; And while I continue to sit here and write freely while listening to any genre of music I choose, you'll sit there in your dark room shouting "Foiled again!" because you can't do anything about it.  Discarded, worthless, throw me away.! Will I tear you apart? Will it, will it tear you apart? When I turn and walk away? Looked back and...not worth the effort Stolen and chewed up, cut, scathed, and relieved Looked back and...not worth the effort You've stolen the true skin  From Autumn to Ashes - The After Dinner Payback and yeah...it's death metal.  &nbsp;

      Sorry about not updating.  I've been busy and stuff.  I've also been really bored.  I'm going to upload pictures of my cousin and Jason.  Basically we stayed up until 4:30 in the morning singing stupid songs.  And I painted stuff.  Oh and we also threw sand-filled socks into the lake.  That was great.
